1
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,570
So I have a plan I'd like to talk to you
about,

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:13,090
I presume that most of you watching this
video are subscribers and are interested

3
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:15,550
in the content of this channel.
Um,

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,320
I'd like to improve it.
There are some features of the videos,

5
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:23,980
especially the class lectures that I'm 
not happy about and I presume you're not

6
00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:25,200
all that happy.
Both them either.

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,730
Um,
most importantly,

8
00:00:27,731 --> 00:00:28,564
I think they lack the proper images,
but there are also segments of the 

9
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:38,130
videos that are only relevant to an in 
class audience,

10
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:42,270
so information about tests and so on and
there's parts of them that arena audible

11
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:43,104
or where the digressions aren't exactly 
appropriate and as well there are 

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,140
lectures across years that pertained to 
the same theme that should be unified in

13
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:56,340
some manner so that they're as 
intelligible and tight as they could be.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,180
I'd also like to make transcripts 
available to people and it would be good

15
00:01:02,181 --> 00:01:03,014
if the lectures were subtitled.
The transcriptions would help with that 

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,690
and then maybe they can also be 
translated.

17
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,023
Um,
I have some volunteers who are already 

18
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:16,601
working on that.
So I set up a page for this channel on a

19
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:19,040
site called Patrion.

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,550
Patriot allows people who are interested
in the contents of say a youtube channel

21
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:26,384
like this one
to help in the further development of 

22
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:31,094
the projects that are posted there.
So if you're interested in doing that 

23
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:38,540
and you'd like to see the sorts of 
things that I just described,

24
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,660
then you could click and subscribe and 
maybe that would be good.

25
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,180
So
that's the plan.
