1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,740
I want to tell you a story now
and it has these characters in it and so

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,420
this is a very important story and it
gets,

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,430
it's called the Enuma elish and it's the
Mesopotamian creation myth and it's

4
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:19,770
important for a bunch of reasons.
First of all,

5
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:21,480
it's the oldest written story we know
of,

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,830
but it's also a Middle Eastern story and
the whole.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,380
All the Abrahamic religions emerged out
of the Middle East and so it's a

8
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:37,800
foundational story.
It's a story that sits at the bottom of

9
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:39,780
our culture now.
It has.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,340
It has similarities to the creation
story in genesis,

11
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,950
whether the creation story in genesis
was derived from it or whether there was

12
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:53,250
a whole variety of similar stories
floating around in the Middle East and

13
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,720
at the same time that we're very.
It's a theme we don't really know,

14
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,290
but it doesn't really.
I don't think it really matters.

15
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,330
We don't know how old the story is.
We know how old it is in its written

16
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,650
form.
It's,

17
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,380
it's,
it's thousands of years old and it's

18
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:16,520
written for them.
Maybe it's 10,000 years old.

19
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,880
It's written for him,
but probably not.

20
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:22,881
It's probably more like 5,000 years old,
but the thing is is that a 5,000 year

21
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:26,940
old story is a lot that's written is way
older than 5,000 years.

22
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:30,990
Like we're used to being in an
environment where there's a million

23
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,250
stories,
you know,

24
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,160
because we have books and movies and all
of these things,

25
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,020
but you know,
in,

26
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,940
in slower moving and more archaic
cultures,

27
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:41,430
especially ones that are just just have
an oral tradition.

28
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,760
It's not like there's a million stories.
There's like 20 canonical stories and

29
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:50,370
God only knows how old they are.
There was evidence,

30
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,730
linguistic evidence.
I just saw a study on this last week.

31
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:58,470
Someone sent it to me showing that some
of the fairytales that the grimm

32
00:01:58,471 --> 00:02:01,680
brothers gathered might be 10,000 years
old.

33
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,460
And that doesn't surprise me because
the,

34
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,620
the kind of depth that's in a good fairy
tale is so the depth is so

35
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,350
the profundity is so deep that there's
no way that someone could just contract

36
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,393
it out.
You know,

37
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,640
100 years ago,
there's layers and layers and layers of

38
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:24,700
meaning and they're basically archetipal
and religious in significance.

39
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,970
And a Hansel and Gretel story is a good
example of that.

40
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,450
Um,
and sleeping beauty is a good example of

41
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:32,430
that too.
A lot of the canonical fairytales are,

42
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:33,900
they're very,
very powerful.

43
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:36,000
They pack a lot of meaning into a very
short

44
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,900
and do a very limited amount of time.
So.

45
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,250
So it was great that this was an arrest
and it was only on earth in the late 18

46
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,490
hundreds.
So we haven't known about this story for

47
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:52,600
a long,
long time.

48
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,420
And so it's,
it was a tremendously exciting discovery

49
00:02:55,421 --> 00:02:57,610
on the part of the people who,
who dug it up.

50
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,510
So I'm going to tell you the story.
So

51
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,863
okay.

52
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,290
The primary character in this story is
a,

53
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,680
like a dragon mother named ty mapped and
tire map.

54
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,660
You can think about her as half the
dragon of chaos and half the destructive

55
00:03:18,661 --> 00:03:20,060
creative feminine.
So she,

56
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,270
you could think about her as what sort
of on the border between what's a known

57
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:27,930
known in an unknown and unknown.
And she is construed as the mother of

58
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:29,760
all things.
Now,

59
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,250
the mother of all things is like what
was revealed when the towers came down

60
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,550
is this tremendously complex background,
multilevel system of operations that's

61
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:49,311
always going on that that identifiable
singular things emerged from now.

62
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,960
The mesopotamians wouldn't have said
that because what they said was this

63
00:03:54,961 --> 00:03:57,390
story,
because that's the form in which their

64
00:03:57,391 --> 00:04:00,480
knowledge had.
It had developed to the point where they

65
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:04,260
could tell a story about instead of
maybe acting it out or dreaming about it

66
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:05,340
in some sense,
you know,

67
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,080
but they couldn't articulate it.

68
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,320
We can barely articulate it now.
So there's time out.

69
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,820
She's viewed as the mother of all things
and she has a husband named absolute

70
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,480
who's her concert.
Very little is said about absolut in

71
00:04:18,481 --> 00:04:20,880
this particular story,
and I think the reason for that,

72
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:25,881
although I'm not sure if this is that
the Mesopotamian civilization was new

73
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:29,310
enough as a technological state,
let's say,

74
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,100
because they made cities as a
technological state that the myth that

75
00:04:34,101 --> 00:04:39,101
myths of humanity hadn't figured out how
to encapsulate the nature of the,

76
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,950
of our technological
dominance hierarchy.

77
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,870
There was a sense that it existed,
but there wasn't a sense of it as a

78
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,610
carer,
differentiated character that was

79
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:52,620
capable of doing all sorts of different
things.

80
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,460
I think that didn't emerge until Egypt,
although I'm not certain about that,

81
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,870
but that's how it looks to me.
So absolute is her husband.

82
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,540
Now,
the way the Mesopotamian started with

83
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,670
the world,
and this is the same way that the people

84
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:07,490
who wrote genesis started the world.

85
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,950
They thought that the world was a desk.
You know what,

86
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,230
what the world is like when you go
outside and you stand in a field.

87
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:14,820
It's a flat field.
You look at the world,

88
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:18,240
it's pretty obvious what it is.
It's a big disk of earth and then

89
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:21,750
there's a dome on top of it and in the
dome or the Sun and the moon and the

90
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:23,640
stars,
and then you might ask,

91
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:24,930
well,
what's underneath the earth?

92
00:05:24,931 --> 00:05:29,430
And that the answer for the
Mesopotamians was fresh water first and

93
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:31,170
then sold water.
And how did you know that?

94
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:32,600
Well,
if you drilled down then up,

95
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,070
the fresh water would come.
So obviously it was fresh water down

96
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:37,530
there and then if you went to the edge
of your territory,

97
00:05:37,531 --> 00:05:39,420
it's like,
well there's the salt water.

98
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:41,940
So the earth was,
you know,

99
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,420
the,
the,

100
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,090
the earth,
roughly speaking,

101
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:49,770
was it disk of matter,
resting on a disk of fresh water,

102
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:54,360
resting on a disk of soap,
water and absolute time that were the

103
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,630
fresh and salt water respected.

104
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,920
Okay,
and now the Mesopotamians thought that

105
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,960
the way that the,
that absolutely time that gave birth to

106
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:09,260
everything was that they joined together
in sexual union.

107
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,890
It's like the Yin and the Yang and it's
very much like that in fact,

108
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,170
and that it was out of their union that
the,

109
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:21,350
the elemental God's emerged and I think
you can think of the elemental gods as

110
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:25,940
there are forces of nature and they're
viewed through.

111
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,950
They're not personified because to
personify something means that you see

112
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:35,210
it as an objective phenomena and then
attribute human characteristics to it.

113
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,600
That isn't how people work.
What happens is we perceive human

114
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:43,601
characteristics and then only with trip
terrible effort do we extract out the

115
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:48,680
objective reality from that.
So we depersonalize things when we

116
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:51,590
become scientific,
but we just naturally see them as

117
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:54,890
characters and you can see this when you
read books to kids,

118
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:57,890
you know,
like everything's a person that train is

119
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:02,050
a person in a car as a person that moon
is a person and the sun is a person and,

120
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,600
and you know,
you read stories to children that have

121
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:08,150
that as a presupposition,
doesn't bother you at all,

122
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:08,590
you know,
you,

123
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,700
you can just fall right into it with no
problem,

124
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,860
you know,
and in the automations you see the sun

125
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:15,920
in the sky smiling and bouncing along
and it doesn't bother you,

126
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:16,670
you know,
it's,

127
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,130
it's no problem to,
to look at the world that way and

128
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:21,620
there's some utility in looking at the
world in that way as,

129
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,610
as we'll discover.

130
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,970
So anyways,
and I think part of the reason that we

131
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:27,230
view things that way.
Oh yeah.

132
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,560
That was the other thing I wanted to
tell you about our perceptual systems is

133
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:35,240
that we.
We do have a social cognitive platform,

134
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,080
intellectual platform,
which means that our primary categories,

135
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:42,020
the primary categories of our mind do
seem to be social.

136
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,310
So you could say that the reason our
mind evolved or or.

137
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,230
No,
you could say that the fundamental

138
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:53,231
selecting pressures on our,
on our mind ensured that the,

139
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,810
the primary substructure of our
cognitive ability was modules that could

140
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:04,430
understand social behavior.
Man Can understand,

141
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:06,290
women,
women could understand men,

142
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,720
men and women could understand children,
children,

143
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,790
men and women could understand the
social world.

144
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,290
And that's.
And that's,

145
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,430
that's what we're specialized for.
And then it was only after those systems

146
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:21,290
develop hyper developed probably under
the,

147
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,510
under the force of sexual selection that
they became able to separate themselves

148
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,530
to some degree from that underlying
social cognitive structure and start to

149
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:32,810
see the world in ways that weren't
personified.

150
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,680
So,
but what that means is that our natural

151
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:41,270
categories are still an anthropomorphic
and dramatic and it actually turns out

152
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:44,690
that they work.
So absolute timeout,

153
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,700
nature and culture is a perfectly
reasonable way of thinking about them.

154
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:50,720
Now they would say,
well,

155
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,890
it's the interplay between nature and
culture that gives rise to the

156
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,120
primordial forces of nature.
Now those forces of nature would be to

157
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:02,820
some degree external like a storm or
like fire.

158
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:05,830
But they would be so to some degree
internal to like,

159
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,010
like the fire of passion,
right?

160
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:12,720
And the and the storm of sorrow.
Because those are natural forces as

161
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:16,020
well.
And one of the things that the ancients

162
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:19,170
knew was that man was created to serve
the gods.

163
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,530
And of course modern people think of
that as a superstition,

164
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:25,500
but that's because they don't really
understand how archaic people thought.

165
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,970
Archaic.
People thought.

166
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,730
Like Freud thought it was like,
yeah,

167
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:31,770
yeah,
you have an ego fine.

168
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,990
You know,
and as long as you're in a box within a

169
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:36,030
bunch of other blocks is the eagle runs
things.

170
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:39,720
But as soon as we put you somewhere
where those boxes are gone,

171
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:44,580
it's the underlying forces of nature
that run you hunger,

172
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,960
thirst,
you know,

173
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,710
aggression,
sexuality and all those things that are

174
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,530
impersonal.
Because of course you have them and you

175
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:53,820
have them,
and so does everyone else,

176
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:57,570
so they're impersonal and transcendent
and they're also eternal,

177
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,840
and so when the art or arcade people
said,

178
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:05,841
and they usually said this with sorrow,
that man was destined to serve the gods.

179
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,390
That's what they meant.
They meant that we were the play.

180
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:14,391
Things have these unbelievably powerful
primordial forces that manifested

181
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:18,000
themselves within our lives and
determined our destinies in,

182
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:18,290
in,
in,

183
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:18,941
in,
in fact,

184
00:10:18,941 --> 00:10:21,840
the Mesopotamian said that specifically
about the elder gods.

185
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,590
They said they were.
They were part of that which determined

186
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,570
human destiny.
They monitor who will talk about in a

187
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:32,340
while was given the tablet of destinies
because when he was,

188
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,530
when he asked to become top God,
he said,

189
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:35,760
well,
if I'm going to be taught God,

190
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,960
I get to determine the destinies and
well,

191
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,520
we'll get to that.
So you kinda got to know what these,

192
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,410
what these archaic,
God's work.

193
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,640
And they were personalities.
You know,

194
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:46,650
when you could say,
well,

195
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,121
yeah,
yeah,

196
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:52,890
maybe it's a mistake to attribute the
qualities of personality to a storm.

197
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,480
Although it depends on what you think a
storm is,

198
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,710
like a modern person would think of a
storm as an objective event that you

199
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:05,580
have subjective reactions to,
and our keg person would more likely

200
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:10,200
think of the storm as the subjective
consequences of the storm,

201
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:11,880
plus the storm all at once.

202
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,290
They would make that separation,
so it's a lot easier to personify

203
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,950
something under those conditions or to
not to personify it,

204
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:22,740
but to.
But to stay within the realm of

205
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:24,720
conceptualization that makes it a
persona.

206
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,620
Find Force.
So the storm God is something that you

207
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,840
know,
that can instill terror into your heart.

208
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,410
It's like,
well,

209
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,570
you know,
yeah,

210
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,810
fair enough.
You know?

211
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,650
All right,
so anyways,

212
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,520
absolutely tie.
They give rise to these primordial gods

213
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:47,010
and I'm going to think about them as
forces of nature and I think that's a

214
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:49,890
reasonable representation for a variety
of reasons.

215
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,360
They're like the titans.

216
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,960
All right,
so the giving rise to these gods and the

217
00:11:57,961 --> 00:12:02,430
gods are their children and they run
about making all sorts of racket.

218
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,210
They were making rockets and they're
doing this and they're doing that and

219
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:07,770
they're building things in there,
messing about with things in their,

220
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,430
their noisily engaged in their
interactions with one another and

221
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:14,070
they're having children and they're
fighting about sex and they're just

222
00:12:14,071 --> 00:12:19,050
making racket like mad and then they do
something stupid and so they're annoying

223
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:22,920
time that as they make all this racket,
she's sorta slumbering down there in the

224
00:12:22,921 --> 00:12:25,770
depths
leaving them be,

225
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:28,080
but they make all this racket that may
annoy her.

226
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,050
It's like it's the environmentalist myth
by the way.

227
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:33,420
It's exactly the same idea.
So you know,

228
00:12:33,421 --> 00:12:34,940
human beings,
we're kind of dopey.

229
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:39,950
We're running around gratifying our
fundamental needs and making racket and

230
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,760
destroying things,
and if we're not careful,

231
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,370
mother nature will come flooding back
and wipe us out.

232
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,533
It's like,
yeah,

233
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,310
that's happened in the past.
It could happen,

234
00:12:47,311 --> 00:12:49,560
but it's an archetypal.
It's an archetypal idea.

235
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,820
It's a mythological idea.
So fine.

236
00:12:52,821 --> 00:12:54,900
They're making racket and timeouts,
leaving the beach,

237
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,660
but then they get arrogant,
I would say,

238
00:12:57,661 --> 00:13:01,440
or careless and they,
they kill app suit and they make their

239
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:05,730
dwelling place on his corpse.
Now that's a that is a brilliant,

240
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,400
brilliant symbolic idea because what it
means,

241
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:10,950
it means a bunch of things,
but one of the things that means is that

242
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,120
in so far as the gods are because
they're masculine,

243
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,510
you're part of the representation of the
dominance hierarchy and the human

244
00:13:18,511 --> 00:13:21,960
interactions within it,
that the idea that that,

245
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,360
that that's all existing on the corpse
of absolute is something like the idea

246
00:13:27,361 --> 00:13:32,361
that all of the natural forces that are
embodied within human beings and driving

247
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:38,421
them are resting on a substructure of
dead culture and everyone knows that

248
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:43,200
because everyone says,
especially modern people,

249
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:44,490
they look back at their culture and they
think,

250
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:45,540
oh,
that thing's dead.

251
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,650
You know,
and we can rest comfortably on its debt

252
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,471
surface.
Well,

253
00:13:49,471 --> 00:13:51,240
that's not right because if it's dead,

254
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,940
well,
if it's dead,

255
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,800
logically speaking,
it's not alive,

256
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,540
and if it's not alive,
it can't adapt.

257
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:01,530
And if it doesn't adapt and it falls
behind and gets full of errors and it

258
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:05,220
gets corrupt and starts to fall apart,
and if it gets corrupted full of errors

259
00:14:05,221 --> 00:14:08,070
and falls apart enough,
then chaos comes back.

260
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,380
That's exactly what happens in the
Mesopotamian myth.

261
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:14,250
So they kill app soon.
They keep making racket and time at

262
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,140
wakes up one day and she thinks,
oh,

263
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,170
they're noisy,
I don't like them that much and now

264
00:14:19,171 --> 00:14:21,870
they've gone and done in my husband,
which is order,

265
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,390
so I'm going to wait them out.
So the guards get wind of this and

266
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,130
they're not very happy about it,
you know,

267
00:14:29,131 --> 00:14:34,131
because after all they're gone.
But she is the god goddess slash drag

268
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,560
that gave them all life and the
probability that they'll prevail in a

269
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:42,810
battle against that which gave them form
is very,

270
00:14:42,811 --> 00:14:43,440
very low.

271
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,440
So they're pretty damn terrified.
So meanwhile time at is generating her

272
00:14:48,961 --> 00:14:52,610
army and she generates quite an army and
that Mesopotamians list out what she

273
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:53,060
does.
She,

274
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:58,060
she first of all picks for her concert,
a new character named king and king who

275
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:04,151
is like the king of the demons monsters.
So her old husband was app.

276
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:08,270
So when maybe he was ordered and her new
husband is like,

277
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,360
he's not someone that you want to have
around at all.

278
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:16,450
And so he's basically put at the hand of
this flanks of terrible monsters and she

279
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:20,090
generates like Scorpion monsters and
crocodile monsters and all sorts of

280
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:22,660
things in our army so that she can go
wipe out these,

281
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,970
these gods.
And so while this is happening,

282
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,690
the gods gathered themselves together
and they decide that they will elect a

283
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:33,050
champion from within their ranks to go
out and fight with tire map.

284
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,740
And so they do that and they send one
God out and he comes back with his tail

285
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:38,150
between his legs,
roughly speaking.

286
00:15:38,151 --> 00:15:39,010
All right,
don't lie,

287
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,050
encounter with chaos.
And then they send another God out.

288
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:44,630
The same thing happens and they send
another God out at the same thing

289
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:46,730
happens.
And it's getting pretty damn hopeless

290
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:50,530
because they're sending out their best
men against chaos and the,

291
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,280
and the mother of all things.
And they're getting scoble all the time

292
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,900
while this was happening.
They continue to produce new generations

293
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:02,360
of Gods.
And at one point this new God emerges

294
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,100
as,
as a young person,

295
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:05,130
I presume.
Um,

296
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,580
but he's,
he's,

297
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,530
there's some things that are different
than about him than any other thing

298
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:12,110
that's being produced so far.
And one of the things that's different

299
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:14,510
is he's,
he's quite tall and powerful,

300
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:15,290
so,
you know,

301
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,800
that's not necessarily so radical,
but he has eyes all the way around his

302
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:23,440
head and when he speaks he can speak
darkness into being an,

303
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,740
he can speak light into being.

304
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,560
So,
so things obey the commands of his

305
00:16:27,561 --> 00:16:30,080
words.
So He's a master of language.

306
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,360
He can see everywhere and he's a master
of language.

307
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,400
Okay.
And so the garlands and checking them

308
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:35,131
out and they think,
wow,

309
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:35,690
you know,
he's,

310
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,820
he's quite something,
maybe we can get him to go after time,

311
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:41,360
Matt.
So they all go to him in this,

312
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,950
in this little group and they say,
look,

313
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,600
Marduk,
because that's his name.

314
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,130
Um,
you know,

315
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:49,670
we've been checking you out and you're
looking pretty impressive.

316
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:51,340
And so we've got a proposition for you.
I,

317
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,740
how about if you go fight time map and
Marta,

318
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:59,770
who's not only all seeing and,
and very capable with languages,

319
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,920
no fool.
And he says,

320
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:01,461
yeah,
yeah,

321
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:02,870
yeah,
I get what you want,

322
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:06,650
but here's the deal.
You get everybody together first and

323
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:12,060
I'll go fight your monster,
but you're going to have a congress and

324
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:13,040
add that Congress.

325
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,810
You're going to elect me king of the
gods,

326
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:20,020
and then I'll go fight time map.
And so of course the other gods aren't

327
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:22,670
very happy about this,
but they go off and they have a congress

328
00:17:22,671 --> 00:17:25,820
and they invite mark to it and they talk
about it and they realize they don't

329
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:28,160
really have any other choice.
So they decided that they're going to

330
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:31,280
elect Marduk to the top of the hierarchy
of gods.

331
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,680
Now that's such a smart idea.
So if you think,

332
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,980
for example,
you can think of a hero and then you

333
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:42,470
could take,
if you took 10 heroes and average them

334
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,810
out of that,
you get a a God,

335
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,970
right?
So it'd be 10 heroes.

336
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:48,980
You get Annetta here out of that,
and that would be a.

337
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,690
and then maybe you do that to 10 sets of
10 heroes and you get 10 mega heroes.

338
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,870
And then you take all those mega heroes
and you figure out what's the same about

339
00:17:57,871 --> 00:18:02,340
them and you abstract that out and then
you get the hero of heroes of heroes.

340
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,950
And that's the archetype.
That's the archetype.

341
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:09,330
It's a process of distillation.
It's like who is the most interesting

342
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:12,240
possible,
the most interesting and capable

343
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:15,330
possible person will that would be this
person.

344
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,150
This is the most memorable possible
person.

345
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,890
Well,
we don't know who that is,

346
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,600
but this is how we figured out how I
could say,

347
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,130
well,
I admire something about you and I

348
00:18:23,131 --> 00:18:26,030
admire something about you.
I can notice that as a phenomenal

349
00:18:26,031 --> 00:18:29,160
logical fact.
You seem very capable in a certain way

350
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:31,530
and you know you have this attribute.
And then I might say,

351
00:18:31,531 --> 00:18:36,090
well,
if I was going to sort out an ideal for

352
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:39,210
myself to follow,
then I take the good parts of all of

353
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:39,840
you.

354
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,840
And I put that into one thing and then I
would make that my ideal.

355
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,940
Well,
that's the origin of the idea of the

356
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:49,941
savior of the Messiah is it's an
emergent idea emerges when people notice

357
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:56,190
that the hero is that the hero is part
of the forest that makes order out of

358
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:57,960
chaos.
Or sometimes the reverse.

359
00:18:57,961 --> 00:19:02,961
When when order has become too rigid,
it can also decompose order bringing a

360
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:05,940
little necessary chaos into it,
rejuvenate the whole structure.

361
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,760
So anyways,
so Marta,

362
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,510
he gets elected king.
Now you might think about how would this

363
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,210
happen historically speaking?
Well,

364
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,100
here's an interesting way of thinking
about it.

365
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:20,550
So imagine a landscape that consists of
tribes,

366
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,640
okay?
And then on top of them,

367
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,060
imagine a landscape of the imagination.
Okay,

368
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:32,061
so each member of each tribal group
lives in their imagined world and that

369
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:37,650
imagined world is full of diabetes and
natural forces of various kinds that

370
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:38,484
they're following.

371
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,510
But then you can imagine that as the
tribes battle it out and organize

372
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:45,300
themselves,
the fingers of the imagination do

373
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:48,300
exactly the same thing.
So as the people are battling,

374
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,620
the Gods in heaven are battling,
which is also a very common mythology,

375
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:57,770
and as the human beings a beat
themselves into a functional group,

376
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,070
their world conceptions do the same
thing.

377
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:04,890
And so over time you move from
polytheism,

378
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:09,350
roughly speaking to monotheism as the
the,

379
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,460
as all of these tribes communicate with
one another in,

380
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,760
in language and in and in combat,
and sort out just exactly what should be

381
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,650
sovereign,
what should it be?

382
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:20,670
Powerful,
what should it be?

383
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:21,481
Dominant,
right?

384
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:23,970
It's a major.
It's a major issue and it's partly

385
00:20:23,971 --> 00:20:25,560
practical.
It's partly conceptual.

386
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,670
So if this is reflected in the
Mesopotamian creation myth,

387
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,170
the gods assemble themselves and they
look among them and they think,

388
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:36,960
okay,
well some one here is,

389
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:42,190
has the characteristics that should,
should be the central element of the top

390
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,630
daddy,
which is like the ultimate value.

391
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,490
Okay,
well the Mesopotamians chose wisely

392
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,770
vision and language.
Those are your most,

393
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:59,130
the most potent weapons you have against
chaos because you,

394
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,560
if you pay attention,
you can see chaos when it first emerges.

395
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,380
And then if you are a master of
language,

396
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:08,170
you can encapsulate it,
then articulate it very rapidly,

397
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:09,910
and you can communicate that to other
people's.

398
00:21:09,911 --> 00:21:13,960
It's like now this easy.
You just cannot overestimate how radical

399
00:21:13,961 --> 00:21:17,860
an idea that is.
It's a staggeringly radical idea that

400
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,170
that's the set of attributes that should
be at the top.

401
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,040
The mesopotamians were trying to figure
out what should be sovereign,

402
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,300
what should be above everything else.
Well,

403
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,630
you might say a person,
it's like,

404
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:29,350
yeah,
yeah,

405
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,320
no,
the person embodies sovereignty.

406
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,010
Sovereignty itself is something else.
So when Frans de Waal,

407
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:39,130
for example,
he was watching chimpanzees hash it out

408
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,720
for dominance in,
in the,

409
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,630
in the zoo.

410
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,620
I think it's in the R and M,
I think.

411
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,960
Anyways,
it's a zoo that has a lot of chimpanzees

412
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,520
and he spent a lot of time watching
them.

413
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,260
And you know,
one idea about the dominant chimp is

414
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:58,261
that he's just the biggest meanness,
like most tyrannical chimp.

415
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,480
It's sort of the strong man theory of
chimp leadership.

416
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:05,410
But what do all observed was that,
well that was sort of true in that the

417
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,130
strongest,
meanest chimpanzee could obtain

418
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:11,590
dominance.
But the problem with him is if he was

419
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:15,730
really like selfish and cruel,
was that he didn't have any friends.

420
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,910
Now chimps have friends and they spent a
lot of time with them and they groom

421
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:21,220
each other and they protect each other
and fights and like,

422
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,920
you can be the ugliest,
meanest chimp around.

423
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:27,640
But if there's two chimps that are three
quarters your strength coming at you,

424
00:22:27,641 --> 00:22:30,250
it's like you,
you lose now.

425
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,970
So that means two chimps that are
capable of enough civilization to find

426
00:22:33,971 --> 00:22:38,971
themselves in to a dyad that is,
that has mutual obligations across time,

427
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:43,180
is way stronger than one ship who
doesn't.

428
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,930
And so what that means is that strength
and viciousness,

429
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,630
you know,
there'll be times when that can emerge

430
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:51,220
as the dominant power,
but it's very,

431
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:52,300
very unstable.
And,

432
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,420
and everyone's motivated to bring it
down as fast as possible.

433
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,760
And the best way to bring it down is
with the coalition.

434
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:01,450
And so partly what that indicates is
that it's actually the chimp who's the

435
00:23:01,451 --> 00:23:04,750
best at making coalitions that's most
likely to become sovereign.

436
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,670
So that,
and that's actually what happens with

437
00:23:06,671 --> 00:23:08,460
the chimps is that,
uh,

438
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:13,850
the dictator chimp is very unstable.
And in the one story I read it of Arnhem

439
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,880
Zoo,
he rose to the top,

440
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:16,740
the,
the,

441
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,573
the,
you know,

442
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,700
bad,
bad guy,

443
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:23,410
the gangster guy and a two chimps went
after him and to pieces.

444
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,800
They tore off his testicles.
Yeah.

445
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,140
And you know,
it agitated the hell out of the rest of

446
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,540
the truth.
And it was like a bloody revolution,

447
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,470
you know,
it was really,

448
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:34,570
really stressful for the troop.
But,

449
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,020
but what it indicates,
and it's so interesting,

450
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:42,130
is that the idea that in a,
in a dominance hierarchy,

451
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:47,340
what's most dominant is power.
That there's no evidence whatsoever that

452
00:23:48,111 --> 00:23:49,130
that's true.
And in fact,

453
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:53,930
I was talking to when I have a partner
in a business that I have,

454
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,150
who was a student of mine at Harvard,
he's a very,

455
00:23:56,151 --> 00:24:00,530
very smart person and I was talking to
him about dominance hierarchies and he

456
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:04,430
said something very that I found very
upsetting on a variety of levels.

457
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:08,120
He said it's not a dominance hierarchy
if you can't put a dog collar on the

458
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:12,020
person one level below you,
which is pretty bloody blunt statement,

459
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:14,150
but when he's he,
he's prone to that sort of thing,

460
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:19,151
but what he meant is that it's possible
that the idea that the term dominance

461
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:23,030
hierarchy is not the right term to be
applying to these sorts of social

462
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:27,320
structures because what it implies is
that what keeps the structure in place

463
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:28,280
is power.

464
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,320
You know,
and that's the sort of claim that people

465
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:31,270
like food,
coal make.

466
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,770
It's all about power.
It's like the thing is,

467
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:37,100
it's not all about power.
It's not all about power.

468
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:41,300
It's not all about power among animals.
So with power,

469
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:43,460
with chimps,
if that's all you've got is power,

470
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:45,260
you're going to get wiped out.
You have to.

471
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,760
So what I found was that the chimps who
were able to establish stable patterns

472
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:54,180
of leadership were quite congenial.
They had a lot of allies,

473
00:24:54,181 --> 00:24:57,980
so they engaged in mutual grooming and a
lot of social interaction and they were

474
00:24:57,981 --> 00:25:01,490
very positively predisposed to the
females in the truth.

475
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,780
So that's pretty interesting,
you know,

476
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,790
because we don't know what constitutes
valid sovereignty,

477
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,300
but even in animals it doesn't seem to
be power.

478
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,810
So,
and then you know,

479
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,220
you look at wolf packs and that sort of
thing and you know,

480
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:18,710
if two wolves go at it for,
for dominance,

481
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,300
one wolf of back off and roll over and
show his throat and you know,

482
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:26,810
like Stalin,
Wolf would just tear out his throat.

483
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,620
But you know,
Churchill Wolf let say would say,

484
00:25:33,081 --> 00:25:34,310
well yeah,
you're kind of useless,

485
00:25:34,311 --> 00:25:36,980
but we might need you around later.
So why don't you get up and you know,

486
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,620
we'll let bygones be bygones and that's
what wolves do,

487
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,570
you know,
and unsurprisingly,

488
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:44,150
because what are you going to do?
Kill everyone in your troop?

489
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,290
Well that doesn't seem like a very
effective strategy either for meeting or

490
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:51,260
for survival.
So the Mesopotamians were trying to work

491
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:54,890
out practically who's going to be
sovereign and at the same time

492
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,490
conceptually what is the proper basis
for sovereignty,

493
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:01,520
which is really the ultimate question in
some sense.

494
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,020
So anyways,
so they elect Marduk and the markets go

495
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,790
to all these eyes and he can speak.
And so he thinks,

496
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,580
all right,
he says,

497
00:26:10,581 --> 00:26:12,110
if I win,
I'm going to get the tablet,

498
00:26:12,111 --> 00:26:14,600
have destinies,
and then I'm taught God.

499
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:15,201
And they say,
yeah,

500
00:26:15,201 --> 00:26:16,100
yeah,
whatever,

501
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,780
if you win,
no problem.

502
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:22,810
So he goes out to fight time and he
takes a sword and he and he takes a net

503
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,580
and they meet on the battlefield and he
encapsulates timeout in a net,

504
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:31,250
which I think is a brilliant,
brilliant metaphor again,

505
00:26:31,251 --> 00:26:35,240
because chaos is a morphous and
unformed,

506
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:37,040
right?
And if you want to conquer it,

507
00:26:37,041 --> 00:26:40,240
you have to encapsulate it within a net,
a net.

508
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,440
You have to,
you have to make it into something

509
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:44,510
rather than something amorphous.
You know,

510
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,930
when.
So look,

511
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,350
maybe a client comes to me and they say,
Oh,

512
00:26:49,351 --> 00:26:52,300
I've been having these terrible symptoms
on my heart races and I,

513
00:26:52,301 --> 00:26:53,020
I,
my,

514
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,140
my breath,
I can't catch my breath and I think I'm

515
00:26:55,141 --> 00:26:57,020
going to die.
And um,

516
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,000
I think maybe I'm having a heart attack
and I'm always at the hospital and they

517
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:01,700
tell me that there's nothing wrong with
me,

518
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:03,060
but I have like,
I'm,

519
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,550
I'm afraid all the time and I'm starting
not to go out.

520
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,870
And I say,
Oh,

521
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,490
you have agoraphobic.
Yeah,

522
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,720
lots of people have that.
You're not the only person like that in

523
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:16,790
the world.
Not only that it has a name,

524
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,630
we know what to do about it,
and there's a treatment course and

525
00:27:20,631 --> 00:27:24,710
they'd go.
And the reason for that is that the

526
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:28,250
unknown unknown has just been turned
into a known unknown and that's a

527
00:27:28,251 --> 00:27:33,251
massive improvement.
And so the person who conceptualizes the

528
00:27:33,381 --> 00:27:36,620
anomalous situations fastest is in fact
the leader.

529
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,860
That's the definition of leadership.
It's like we don't know what's going on.

530
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,980
This is what's going on and what.
And when you say,

531
00:27:42,981 --> 00:27:47,030
this is what's going on,
you also simultaneously say,

532
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:50,930
here's a million other things that could
have been going on that aren't.

533
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,310
So it's a process of radical
simplification and it lowers the stress

534
00:27:55,311 --> 00:27:56,590
levels immediately.
Anyway,

535
00:27:56,591 --> 00:28:01,280
so time that goes in or articles,
he gets her in a nap and then he splits

536
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:04,370
in half and he makes heaven out of one
half and the earth out of the other for

537
00:28:04,371 --> 00:28:09,371
the human beings and uh,
and he goes back to any defeats,

538
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,130
Keto and all the monsters.
And then he goes back to tell the other

539
00:28:13,131 --> 00:28:14,540
gods and they're pretty happy about
this.

540
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:16,580
And he knew had the tablet,
the destinies,

541
00:28:16,581 --> 00:28:19,370
but Martin took that from him and now he
has it.

542
00:28:19,371 --> 00:28:23,360
So he gets to determine destiny and he
makes human beings out of king whose

543
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,150
blood,
which is quite an interesting little

544
00:28:26,151 --> 00:28:29,330
twist to the story and he makes them to
serve the gods.

545
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,790
And so,
so that's that.

546
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:32,683
So,

547
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,880
so the idea is that the,
the hero who can see and can communicate

548
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:41,320
is also the hero who separates out the
elements of existence so that it becomes

549
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:45,370
a habitable place and that humans should
serve that serve.

550
00:28:45,371 --> 00:28:46,420
Margo.
Well,

551
00:28:46,421 --> 00:28:48,410
you have to serve something.
Well,

552
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,390
you're going to serve a natural force of
some sort of you gonna be all anger.

553
00:28:52,391 --> 00:28:54,280
You can be all last,
are going to be all love,

554
00:28:54,281 --> 00:28:57,490
we can be all hunger,
or are you going to represent some

555
00:28:57,491 --> 00:28:59,290
integrated,
ah,

556
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,510
some some balanced and integrated

557
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:07,650
emergent property of that.
It's also socially constructed and also

558
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:11,970
that you're a balance of natural forces
and you're a civilized person.

559
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,320
That's some sort of essence and that's
what you're going to strive for.

560
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:16,180
Well,
that's Marta,

561
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,260
so you're supposed to be a good murder.
Now,

562
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,530
Margaret is immortal now.
The only person who was identified with

563
00:29:21,531 --> 00:29:23,870
Martech in the Mesopotamian realm was
the emperor.

564
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:27,980
Now they lived in a walled city,
and so what the emperor,

565
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,950
the reason the emperor was sovereign was
because he was supposed to be the

566
00:29:30,951 --> 00:29:34,130
embodiment of Marico and earth,
which meant that his job was to

567
00:29:34,131 --> 00:29:37,310
transform chaos into order whenever
chaos threatened.

568
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,710
He was supposed to transform it back
into order.

569
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:44,230
So this is what Mesopotamians did at the
New Year's celebration when the year is

570
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:45,280
rejuvenated,
right?

571
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:47,800
The old year dies.
Of course we know that because we still

572
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:49,960
do it,
and the new year is this new baby.

573
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,290
It's a time of new beginnings.
So the Mesopotamians would take the

574
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:57,520
emperor out of the city and they'd strip
him of all his emperor close,

575
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:02,800
and then they'd make them recite all the
ways during the last year that he'd been

576
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,080
a bad Marduk,
like he hadn't kept,

577
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,920
he hadn't been encountering chaos
properly and hadn't been keeping order

578
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:12,760
property,
so and confess all of his inadequacies.

579
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:16,480
Then the priest would whack them with a
glove as a,

580
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,330
you know,
as a ritual punishment,

581
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,860
and then they take all the statues out
of the old gods out of the city,

582
00:30:23,861 --> 00:30:28,861
and then they really represent the
battle between Martech and tire mount,

583
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:35,490
and then the emperor was mark and he
would win and then he would have sex

584
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:39,440
with a ritual prostitute,
which was that.

585
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,600
This is a much tougher concept,
but it's a way of symbolizing the fact

586
00:30:43,601 --> 00:30:48,280
that if the creative force encounters
the positive element of the feminine,

587
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,650
it's like the prince and sleeping
beauty,

588
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,130
getting sleeping beauty from the grasp
of the evil queen who turns into the

589
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:54,720
Dragon.

590
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,020
It's exact because it's weird,
right?

591
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,330
You've seen that and you understand it.
Right?

592
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,010
Sleeping.
Beauty's all in the tower.

593
00:31:00,011 --> 00:31:04,330
She's covered by,
she's hemmed in by a huge fields of

594
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:06,760
thorns.
The Evil Queen is trying to stop the

595
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:09,640
prints from getting to her.
She turns into a dragon which makes

596
00:31:09,641 --> 00:31:12,760
absolutely no sense,
but everyone follows it and then he has

597
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:14,340
to fight his way through that to get to
the,

598
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,290
to the main.
It's the same idea in a different

599
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:21,760
context and then order productive order
being reestablished.

600
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:25,330
Everybody goes back into the kingdom and
it's renewed for the next year and

601
00:31:25,331 --> 00:31:29,320
that's the idea behind Mesopotamian
sovereignty and it's bloody brilliant

602
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,020
because it's an abs.
It's,

603
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:31,710
it's,
it's,

604
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,700
it's the beginnings of,
of law.

605
00:31:33,701 --> 00:31:34,690
In some sense.
It's,

606
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,710
it's the idea that to be,
to be proper,

607
00:31:38,711 --> 00:31:41,080
even if you're a desperate,
even if you're the king,

608
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:46,410
there's a sacred pattern of behavior
that you must adhere to,

609
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,680
which is the consequence of a congress,
of the gods deciding what the most

610
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:54,130
effective mode of being is.

611
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,960
It's staggeringly brilliant and,
and it took that story.

612
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,020
We just have no idea how long that story
took.

613
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,470
Do we merge?
I would say it's,

614
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,890
it's the consequence of the full course
of human evolutionary history.

615
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,550
Like the,
there are elements in it that are as old

616
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:12,500
as mammals and maybe older than that,
you know,

617
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,170
if you think about those patterns being
embedded in behavior long before they

618
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:19,720
were abstracted out into
representations,

619
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:24,520
it's unbelievably archaic and ancient
and so you have time at the great

620
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:27,430
mother.
You have absolutely the great father,

621
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,080
you have Marduk the archetypal son,
you have king who's the negative element

622
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:33,340
of Marta,
right?

623
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,740
And you have the drama of all those
characters interacting across time and

624
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:41,510
that's,
that's the mythological,

625
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:46,010
mythological representation of reality.
And tying that to tie it into the

626
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:47,840
neuropsychology that we talked about,
you know,

627
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,090
we talked about anomaly,
right?

628
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,570
And how normally you have a,
a,

629
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,510
a,
a box that you're in that is your world,

630
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,270
but that box doesn't contain everything
in the world.

631
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:02,000
There's a lot of things that are good at
and sometimes they poked their head in

632
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:05,510
like a snake and then that's disruptive.
And what do you do?

633
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,410
Well,
you have to,

634
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:11,930
you have to voluntarily encounter the
snake then either defeated or make

635
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:13,750
something valuable out of it.
You know,

636
00:33:13,751 --> 00:33:16,430
you could cower and hide,
but all that generally means the state

637
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:20,510
grows and grows until there's hardly any
you in the box and there's all snake and

638
00:33:20,511 --> 00:33:22,320
that's actually the Mesopotamian
stories.

639
00:33:22,321 --> 00:33:26,960
It's like if the elder gods weren't so
careless and had been paying attention

640
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:29,960
and hadn't killed absolute time,
that would've stayed asleep the whole

641
00:33:29,961 --> 00:33:31,440
time.
So.

642
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,940
Well.
So that's the,

643
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:40,060
that's the level of isomorphism.
So what's,

644
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,840
what's fascinating,
but I think inevitable is that the

645
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:48,440
mythology reflects the physiology,
but how could it not?

646
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,440
The physiology produced the mythology,
like,

647
00:33:51,441 --> 00:33:54,170
of course that's going to be the case.
It shouldn't be a surprise.

648
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:55,820
It should be,
it should be,

649
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,430
it should be.
The reverse should be a surprise.

650
00:33:58,431 --> 00:34:00,200
It's like there's no relationship
between these,

651
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,600
these old stories and the way that human
beings are structured.

652
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,620
It's like,
well,

653
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,970
no,
no,

654
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,820
that's a dumb idea.
So,

655
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:15,973
well,

656
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,030
that's the Mesopotamian creation myths
and it's,

657
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,410
it's a killer.
It's,

658
00:34:19,411 --> 00:34:21,700
it's a,
it's a staggering story.

659
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,740
And you know,
it still sits.

660
00:34:23,741 --> 00:34:27,640
Whether we know it or not,
it sits at the very base of our culture.

661
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:31,300
It's absolute that story.
And if we kill it,

662
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:35,920
which we will or have been,
then then look out,

663
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:40,150
you know,
we know the story from so long ago,

664
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,500
if you let your culture die and act
carelessly towards it,

665
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:47,890
all hell will break loose and it's no
joke.

666
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,910
So,
so here we are trying to revive a fight.

667
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,580
It's pretty weird that these things
happened to be real.

668
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,580
But then if you think about it,
well,

669
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:05,620
how could it be otherwise?
You know,

670
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,920
I mean,
you think all these people who lived

671
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:13,950
before us for the tens of millions of
years that we've had are vaguely human.

672
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:20,220
Pre predessessors were stupid.
They weren't and they weren't ignorant

673
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:25,660
and they weren't superstitious or any of
those things.

674
00:35:25,661 --> 00:35:28,330
They were,
they were,

675
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,400
they were tough enough so that we're
here.
