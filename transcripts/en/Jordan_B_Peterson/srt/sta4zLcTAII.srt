1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,040
So while you guys were gone,
I went on Wikipedia and looked up,

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,030
oh,
cyrus,

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,790
you know,
because when I did the research for this

4
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:15,780
book certainly wasn't possible to get 
access to that kind of information,

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,290
instantaneous,
you know,

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,890
and the stories that are laid out in 
there,

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,873
there's a thread that runs through the 
stories that's laid out there that's 

8
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:24,930
quite similar to the one that I told 
you,

9
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:28,170
but there's all sorts of details that 
are very radically different.

10
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:31,710
And so I don't really know what to say 
about that.

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,573
And you know,
part of the reason that people like 

12
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:37,440
Joseph Campbell and Carl young and,
uh,

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,000
the ridge,
there was an original anthropologist and

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,010
armchair anthropologist who wrote a book
called the Golden Bough,

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,263
whose name escapes me momentarily,
but it was one of the first attempts to 

16
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:49,044
do across cultural categorization of 
mythology and to look for underlying 

17
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:53,550
commonalities.

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,350
Now,
the problem is,

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,543
you know,
I told you about Naomi Klein going down 

20
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:01,710
to Argentina and looking at the factory 
through her particular Lens.

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,173
The problem is is that when you develop 
a lens and then you look at things 

22
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:06,264
through it,
you may just see what that lends 

23
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,750
heightens,
you know,

24
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:09,923
and I think that that's a criticism that
could be leveled against the sorts of 

25
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:14,394
things that I'm telling you about that 
I've cherry picked certain stories and 

26
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:21,720
interpreted them in certain ways so that
they fall coherently into a,

27
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,913
a scheme of thought and so I'll tell you
some of the things that I do 

28
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:27,684
methodologically to protect myself 
against that in so far as that's 

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,830
possible.
So

30
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,730
there's this idea in psychology called 
the multi-method multi multitrack method

31
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,530
of construct validation,
which is God awful agglomeration of,

32
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:44,893
of a jargon,
but it actually means something and it 

33
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:49,314
was the construction of two 
psychologists back in the late 19 

34
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:53,304
fifties crime back in meal who are 
interested in what psychologists meant 

35
00:01:56,791 --> 00:02:00,000
when they said something exists,
like say anger.

36
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,490
Is that a real thing?
Well,

37
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,620
what do you mean?
What do you mean thing?

38
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,510
What is it that you're talking about?
What?

39
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:09,360
His anger exactly.
I don't mean as anger,

40
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:10,194
but as an idea what sort of idea is the 
idea of anger or the idea of anxiety or 

41
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:15,414
the idea of sadness or the idea of self 
esteem or self competence or any of 

42
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:23,400
these things that psychologists talk 
about as if their realities.

43
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:24,234
It's like,
well,

44
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,040
some realities are very tangible,
right?

45
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:27,874
And and it's,
it's somewhat easy to come to agreement 

46
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:33,960
about the contours of their existence in
the borders,

47
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:35,880
but other things are way more difficult 
than that.

48
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,403
And so their idea was that if something 
actually exists that you should be able 

49
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:43,014
to measure it multiple ways using 
multiple techniques and still get the 

50
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:50,790
same answer.
And so your senses do that.

51
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,900
You have five of them.

52
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,710
The reason you have five apparently is 
because evolution has determined that if

53
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:58,680
you only had four or you die more often,
you know,

54
00:02:58,681 --> 00:02:59,514
so it seems as if you have five separate
sources of information that all lead to 

55
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:04,924
the same conclusion.
You can be relatively certain that the 

56
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:11,410
conclusion that's reached is real.
Okay.

57
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:14,410
Well,
the multimap multitrack method is,

58
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,160
is an application of that idea to 
construct validation,

59
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:21,490
which is like you can think of anger as 
an idea,

60
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:24,880
as a construct.
It's a terminological issue.

61
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,880
Just define it as a construct.
Psychological Constructs.

62
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,130
How do you know if they're real?
Well,

63
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:30,964
the idea is it's very complicated.
You have to measure them in multiple 

64
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:34,864
ways.
All the ways you measure them have to 

65
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:37,264
give the same reading.
Then you have to show that that idea is 

66
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:42,874
the same in certain ways as other ideas 
that it's related to and different from 

67
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:48,370
other ideas that it's not related to.

68
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,370
So let me give you an example.
There's a construct neuroticism,

69
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,361
and you might say,
well,

70
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:59,560
there's another construct depression.
Well then you might say,

71
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:00,520
well,
are those separate?

72
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:02,830
Are they the same?
Well,

73
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:06,130
that's a tough one because in many,
many ways they're the same.

74
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,443
Are they the same in any important?
Are they different in any important 

75
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:11,950
ways?
Well,

76
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,430
the way you do that technically is you 
would measure neuroticism,

77
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:16,264
however you were going to measure it.
Maybe I'd have you tell me how neurotic 

78
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:20,524
you were using a questionnaire and then 
I'd have your friend tell me and maybe 

79
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:24,034
you're a parent,
so we got it pretty good triangulation 

80
00:04:25,961 --> 00:04:26,794
on your neuroticism,
and then I'd have them do the same 

81
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:30,784
thing.
All of those people do the same thing 

82
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:34,600
with regards to your levels of 
depression and anxiety.

83
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,363
Then I'd use both those measures to 
predict something else like how well 

84
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,493
your life goes in terms of career over 
the next 10 years and if neuroticism 

85
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:50,570
predicted and depression predicted so 
they were correlated,

86
00:04:50,571 --> 00:04:51,404
then I think,
well there's some relationship and then 

87
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:54,730
I'd look at them at the same time.

88
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,330
If I predict with neuroticism and then I
add new depression to the mixed,

89
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,643
does that give me more predictive power?
It's sort of like is does a equals C or 

90
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:09,760
does a plus b?
We'll see.

91
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:11,950
That's all you're asking your regression
equation,

92
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,660
roughly speaking.
Well,

93
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:17,080
if a equals c is just as good as a plus 
b equals c,

94
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:17,914
then one of the things,
especially if the two things are also 

95
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:20,344
correlated,
depression and anxiety and neuroticism 

96
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:25,810
are going to be very highly correlated.
Like point seven,

97
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:27,250
something like that.
You might say,

98
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:30,700
well those are the same thing just 
because they have different names.

99
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,560
It's not helpful.
So.

100
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,260
And part of it is,
you know,

101
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,480
it's a pragmatic conceptualize.
A Asian of reality is like,

102
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,343
is this,
is this categorization structure good 

103
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:42,410
for something?
Okay,

104
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,260
well,
so anyways,

105
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,094
all unpack all that and say,
well part of my rules for determining 

106
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:52,390
whether these things were useful or not 
was to see if the idea is applied across

107
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:54,280
multiple levels of analysis.

108
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,920
So that's why I told you about the 
conceptual.

109
00:05:56,921 --> 00:06:00,800
So sort of the cognitive psychology and 
then the neuropsychological.

110
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,570
So there's some,
you know,

111
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,853
input of brain research and then the 
narrative or mythological and then the 

112
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:11,210
cross cultural.
I think,

113
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:12,044
well,
those all stack up in a certain way so 

114
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:17,240
that if you look between all of them,
you can see a pattern and it seems to me

115
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,283
increasingly unlikely that that pattern 
would be there across all of those 

116
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:25,190
levels at the same time.
Now you could say,

117
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:26,480
well,
you know,

118
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,260
that depends on how good you are at 
weaving a story,

119
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,700
but at some point

120
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,030
encapsulating that many phenomena and 
weaving a coherent story out of them.

121
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:40,144
If such a thing doesn't exist,
it seems to be to become cognitively 

122
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:44,854
impossible.
You just can't do it unless there's 

123
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:50,260
actually something there.
So and every,

124
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:50,861
you know,
of course,

125
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:53,680
everything I tell you also,
is there a simplification?

126
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:57,490
It has to be because you could spend 
your whole life investigating any of the

127
00:06:57,491 --> 00:06:58,324
things that we're talking about.
And so what I'm hoping is that I've 

128
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:01,114
abstracted out the central issues of 
these multiple levels of analysis and 

129
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:06,070
that,
you know,

130
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,810
put together each of them support all 
the others anyways.

131
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,720
Who knows,
you know,

132
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,890
I don't know,
but

133
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,550
so far so good.
Okay.

134
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:21,100
So this is a cool representation.
I really liked this one.

135
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:26,101
This is called the open virgin and it's 
a 14th or 13th century sculpture,

136
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:27,634
if I remember correctly.
It's made out of wood and these things 

137
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:30,790
were actually.

138
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,623
This isn't the only one of them.
They were a form of religious 

139
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:38,800
representation that that had different 
exemplars.

140
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:40,930
You could find different ones of them 
online.

141
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,333
This is brilliant,
this bloody thing as far as I'm 

142
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:46,450
concerned,
so let me show you.

143
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,120
Let me show you this,
this figure again,

144
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,850
so basically what you have here in this 
figure,

145
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,690
this is at world conception and the 
world conception is roughly.

146
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:58,990
There's an individual positive and 
negative.

147
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:04,090
He's he or she is in a cultural sphere 
that's positive or negative,

148
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,950
that's embedded in the world outside of 
culture that's positive and negative and

149
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:11,740
all of it comes from potential.
That's the idea.

150
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,143
Now,

151
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,013
this map shows all of the positives and 
negatives in relationship to one 

152
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:20,574
another.
You see it's not perfectly symmetrical 

153
00:08:22,141 --> 00:08:24,960
and the reason for that is as far as I 
can tell,

154
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:25,794
the adversarial element of the 
individual is the thing that generates 

155
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,574
the tyrannical element of culture and 
that's the thing that like gets in your 

156
00:08:35,611 --> 00:08:36,444
way of establishing a creation,
creative relationship with what you 

157
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:41,400
don't know.
Well anyways,

158
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:46,170
here's,
here is a manifestation of that.

159
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:47,004
I believe,
and I liked this manifestation because 

160
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,033
like it's obviously Christian but not.
It's more mythological than Christian 

161
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,890
and the reason for that,
well it's quite obvious.

162
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,060
So the,
the super ordinate figure is married.

163
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,643
The feminine now you think,
well it's amazing the person who carved 

164
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:15,330
this just didn't get burnt up at the 
inquisition because it's a radical idea,

165
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,523
but it's,
it's just an indication of how the 

166
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:19,104
mythology can change the causal 
relationship between these different 

167
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:22,824
elements.

168
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,570
So you have Mary there,
she's sort of,

169
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:29,750
she's the ultimate in femininity,
a ultimate feminine Deity,

170
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,010
but only the positive side.
Right?

171
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,203
And then within her.
So it's like nature opens itself up and 

172
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,450
benevolent nature opens itself up and 
what you see inside is culture.

173
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,170
That's God the father holding the 
individual.

174
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,620
And the individual in this case is the 
crucified Christ,

175
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,190
which is a wonderful conceptualization 
as far as I'm concerned,

176
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:55,800
because of course that is what life does
to people.

177
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,810
That's why that's such a powerful 
symbol.

178
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,130
It's like,
you know,

179
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,833
Christ is the person who has to face the
reality of his own death voluntarily or 

180
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:09,960
involuntarily who's betrayed by his 
culture and betrayed by his friends.

181
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:10,611
It's like,
it's,

182
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:14,430
it's sort of like he's,
he's exposed to the most,

183
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,480
the most torturous elements of 
individual Ba and simultaneously,

184
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:21,984
at least in principle,
transcends them while you bloody well 

185
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:25,220
better do that because otherwise,
well,

186
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,083
what's going to happen?

187
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,960
You're just,
you're done.

188
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,230
If you don't do that,
and it's even worse.

189
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:34,590
It's not only that you fail,
that's just the beginnings of it.

190
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,070
If you can't transcend the tragedy of 
your being,

191
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,730
then you get corrupted.
You know,

192
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,630
because I see this happening to people 
all the time.

193
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,870
So
you know,

194
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:50,430
if you're suffering and you can't cope 
with it,

195
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,190
generally speaking,
what happens is that it embitters you.

196
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,800
And once you get bitter,
you get resentful.

197
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:01,530
And once you get resentful,
you look for revenge.

198
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,290
And that can just get completely out of 
hand.

199
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:08,190
Now that's a quick trip to the worst 
suburb of the underworld,

200
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,140
that's for sure.
So,

201
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,563
you know,
it's not only that if you don't manage 

202
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,660
this transcendent act that you're 
swamped by the tragedy of your life,

203
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:19,494
it's worse than that.
You're swamped by the tragedy of your 

204
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:23,340
life.
And then that corrupts you.

205
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,323
And then you start working to make 
everything even more tragic than it has 

206
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:29,370
to be.
And so I think that's why,

207
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,880
you know,
in medieval Christian conceptualizations

208
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:35,670
in particular,
that the idea of hell,

209
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,013
the desk,
that the idea that you were destined to 

210
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:42,930
hell was worse than the idea of dying.
And that's a strange idea,

211
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:43,764
you know,
because you think this is what the 

212
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:46,510
terror management theorists thing too is
like,

213
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,373
oh,
there's nothing worse than the fear of 

214
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:49,050
death.
It's,

215
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,050
that's wrong.
They don't have the right imagination.

216
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,180
There are lots of things that are worse 
than the fear of death.

217
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,940
So
I'm not trying to trivialize the fear of

218
00:11:59,941 --> 00:12:00,900
death,
obviously,

219
00:12:00,901 --> 00:12:01,734
you know,
but,

220
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,430
but I don't think it's very difficult 
to,

221
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,720
to understand that there are some things
that you would rather die than do.

222
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,143
I mean,
I'm sure that I could get you guys to 

223
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:15,820
sit for 15 minutes and say,
okay,

224
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:18,880
you list 10 things that you would rather
die than do.

225
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,410
Oh,
that's easy.

226
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,410
That's easy.
Especially if you're a parent,

227
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,600
you can think of those things in no time
flat.

228
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,790
Okay.
So that was pretty interesting.

229
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,610
So you've got the superordinate feminine
figure here,

230
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,730
which is not what you'd expect from a 
Christian representation,

231
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,593
right?
You expect God to be on the outside and 

232
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:38,270
then Mary and then Christ in all 
likelihood.

233
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,350
Although that would also be a valid 
representation.

234
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,873
Right?
So because you can think of the mother 

235
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:45,034
as something that's protected by the 
culture and supporting the individual 

236
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,700
because that's basically what this 
representation shows.

237
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,120
But then you see on the,
on the open side,

238
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:56,170
so I really liked this.

239
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,003
I think it's so cool is that you've got 
all these people who aren't archetipal 

240
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:05,530
figures there in the little crowd and 
they're gazing at the central figure and

241
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:08,890
of course that's exactly what's happened
in Christianity for 2000 years.

242
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,190
Right?
And so far spread is that for 2000 years

243
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,024
people have been looking at that image 
which is the crucifixion transfixed by 

244
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:18,100
it.
Well,

245
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:19,330
why?
Well,

246
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,620
you know,
for reasons that we don't understand,

247
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:27,310
when everybody woke up and like the late
18 hundreds and said,

248
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,200
why were we looking at that for the last
2000 years?

249
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,430
The first answer was,
well,

250
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:35,830
we really don't have the foggiest idea.
You know,

251
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,230
it was just one of the things that we 
did,

252
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,830
roughly speaking,
it encapsulated people within the belief

253
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:45,320
system.
So that's another good example anyway,

254
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,010
of how this archetypal imagery can 
manifest itself,

255
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,340
say spontaneously in the imagination of 
an artist.

256
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,000
And the thing is the,
that's a sacred image and it,

257
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,320
it is.
In actuality that's what it is.

258
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,450
What it shows is while there's a 
superordinate transcendent natural order

259
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,403
that's,
that has a beneficial element that we 

260
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:11,290
associate with femininity and inside 
that there is a supportive culture,

261
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,124
is properly nested if things are 
organized properly and it's both of 

262
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:18,070
those things that provide support for 
the suffering.

263
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:19,550
Individuals like,
yeah,

264
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,393
that was pretty much gone it so now that
doesn't exhaust the meaning of this 

265
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:28,540
particular representation.
There's a lot more to it than that,

266
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,940
but just that's not so bad.

267
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,200
And then you know,
I can show you a,

268
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,090
a more negative representation.
I think I've showed you this before,

269
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,320
like this would be a representation of 
the negative element of the feminine.

270
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,773
And so you have Kelly here.
Kelly is the goddess to whom you make 

271
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:51,254
sacrifices.
Hopefully if you make the right 

272
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:53,594
sacrifices,
then Kelly turns into her positive 

273
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:58,220
counterpart and you know,
you think,

274
00:14:58,221 --> 00:14:59,990
well that's.
You know what?

275
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,483
Huh?
How does sacrifice effect your 

276
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:04,820
relationship with the gods?
Well,

277
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,800
first of all,
there's no gods and second of all,

278
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:07,634
well then you know,
what the hell are you doing with the 

279
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,540
sacrifices?
But it's pretty straightforward.

280
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,820
We've already talked about this at 
length,

281
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:14,923
you do make sacrifices all the time and 
what that means is that you act as if 

282
00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:23,030
you can have a relationship with your,
with being,

283
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,553
you assume that if you withhold certain 
things from yourself now that you will 

284
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:31,430
improve your relationship both with 
nature and culture.

285
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,653
It's like,
and I already told you guys that as far 

286
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:35,324
as I was concerned,
that was like the most stunning 

287
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,083
cognitive discovery of mankind.
It's the discovery of the future and 

288
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:45,380
it's the discovery of the relationship 
between the present and the future.

289
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,351
You know,
it's,

290
00:15:46,351 --> 00:15:47,184
it's such an amazing idea that you can 
alter your behavior now and it'll pay 

291
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:53,240
off any year.
God,

292
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,330
that's not obvious.
It's certainly not animals.

293
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,530
Don't think that way.
No,

294
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,010
I mean some of them act that way,
like these and so on,

295
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:04,130
but that's just built right into their 
behavior as far as we could tell.

296
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,010
So anyway,
so there's Kelly,

297
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,930
you know,
she's a spider.

298
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,933
She's in a web of fire.
The fire is outside at web that's made 

299
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:18,140
out of skulls.
She's got weapons in her hand.

300
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:21,050
Your hair is on fire.
She's got a headdress of skulls.

301
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:23,120
I mean if you ever saw something like 
that,

302
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:24,830
it would traumatize you so badly.

303
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,663
You wouldn't be able to get out of your 
house for like five years and that's 

304
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,620
exactly what it is.
That's what it is.

305
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:31,454
It's a representation of all of that.
That would traumatize you if you 

306
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:36,074
encountered it and they know it's an 
attempt to encapsulate that as an image 

307
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:40,304
and what you could say in some sense is 
that the people who developed this 

308
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:44,264
image,
we're attempting to conceptualize the 

309
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:47,354
class of all terrifying things and once 
you get the classical terrifying things 

310
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:52,814
conceptualize,
you can come up with the class of all 

311
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:56,234
useful responses and that would be 
something like the proper way to behave 

312
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,420
and sacrifices and integral element of 
that.

313
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,410
It's like,
yeah,

314
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,190
absolutely right.
Absolutely dead on.

315
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,190
So unless you don't believe that 
sacrifice works,

316
00:17:10,191 --> 00:17:12,260
in which case,
what the hell are you doing here?

317
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,750
You know,
I mean you act out your belief.

318
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,153
So when it's a firm belief,
and you would also say if things fell 

319
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:20,800
apart so badly that sacrifice,
no,

320
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,653
no longer paid off.
Your lights would basically become 

321
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:26,330
intolerable,
so because it would mean you have,

322
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,403
you would have,
would have abandoned all sense of 

323
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:32,620
control over the outcomes of your 
actions while you.

324
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:37,190
You can't live like that.
You'd just die of stress so well.

325
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,720
And as I said,
you know,

326
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:40,190
she's,
she was pregnant.

327
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:41,024
She's given birth to this unfortunate 
character who she's devouring intense 

328
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,670
first,
like it's a rough image.

329
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,230
It's the image of the destructive 
element of nature.

330
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,800
And so that's the negative side of the 
feminine,

331
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,780
we might say,
so

332
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,653
mirrors that positive representation.
This is a Greek representation that's 

333
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:14,091
Diana or Artemis hoping.
I'm remembering this properly.

334
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,593
She's multi breasted.
Know this circle around her head is 

335
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,440
undoubtedly a representation of her 
cosmic nature,

336
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:26,820
you know,
so it's like a halo.

337
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,620
The Halo is basically a planetary body 
like the sudden,

338
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:36,420
do you call it cosmic body,
like the sun or the moon behind the head

339
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:38,850
of the divine individual with all of 
that power,

340
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,770
you know,
shining forward.

341
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,160
So it's an attempt to use,
you know,

342
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,180
if you look up at the moon or you look 
up at the sun,

343
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:47,940
there's an element of that that's 
characterized by all.

344
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,860
You can't help but feel that at least 
it's beauty and power and sometimes it's

345
00:18:52,861 --> 00:18:54,260
overwhelming.
Well you,

346
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,313
you take the representation of the,
of the personality and you throw the 

347
00:18:58,981 --> 00:18:59,814
representation of these cosmic powers 
behind it and it's an attempt to 

348
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:07,680
represent transcendent value.
It's very intelligent,

349
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,240
brilliant.
In fact,

350
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,913
and so partly what you're trying to do 
as you conduct your life is you're 

351
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:14,334
trying to get all of these archetypal 
forces in proper balance and I suppose 

352
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,870
in some sense to get them tilted towards
the good.

353
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,420
If that's possible.
I mean that's what this.

354
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:30,000
That's what this representation in some 
sense you might say,

355
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,863
where is it here?

356
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:39,803
Yeah.

357
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,091
You might say,
well,

358
00:19:41,091 --> 00:19:41,720
if,
if,

359
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,100
if you got everything ordered properly,
this is what being would be like

360
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,380
still pretty rough given that the 
crucifix is at its center.

361
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,350
No,
no.

362
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,183
I don't know.
If you think about it from a purely 

363
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,170
technical perspective,
roughly speaking,

364
00:20:01,171 --> 00:20:04,200
each of these archetypes is split into 
positive and negative.

365
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,700
You might say,
well,

366
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,400
that's just how it is.
There is no appropriate.

367
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,303
There is no way that you can interact 
with all of them so that the whole 

368
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:16,400
system tilts towards the positive.
No,

369
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,303
but

370
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,520
okay,

371
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,573
but I don't think that's true.
I think you can get them lined up so 

372
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,014
that things tilt towards the positive 
and I think that you can detect when 

373
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:31,710
that happens because that those are the 
periods in your life where you feel that

374
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,293
your richly enough engaged in what 
you're doing in life is meaningful 

375
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:40,860
enough so that the rest of it,
the substructure that makes it necessary

376
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,870
is,
is worth it.

377
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,590
It's worthwhile in all that the negative
exists is okay,

378
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:50,860
given the way that things are structured
now,

379
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,890
I think that whether or not that's true 
is in some sense the eternal question of

380
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:58,720
mankind.
You know,

381
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,860
can you organize your life so that it's 
good?

382
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,693
Well,

383
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,653
it seems like you can certainly allow 
your life to degenerate so that it's 

384
00:21:09,211 --> 00:21:11,310
terrible.
That seems indisputable.

385
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,173
Right?
And there does seem to be an element of 

386
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,004
choice in that,
although you know something terrible 

387
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:17,520
could happen to you that you have no 
choice,

388
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,210
you have no choice of or control over,
but it certainly seems that you could do

389
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:27,420
any number of stupid and blind things 
that make everything worse.

390
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,220
I think that's a common experience and I
also think you'd be hard pressed to find

391
00:21:32,221 --> 00:21:33,054
anyone who wouldn't say that there were 
things they did consciously and 

392
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:37,764
willingly that were up their own choice 
that they didn't have to do that made 

393
00:21:42,181 --> 00:21:43,014
things worse.
So we seem to have some sense of our 

394
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:46,584
moral agency and we seem automatically 
to accept some responsibility for the 

395
00:21:51,691 --> 00:21:54,660
outcomes of our actions.
And so partly what that means is that we

396
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:57,210
do believe that we can make things 
better or worse.

397
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,313
And I suppose in some way that means 
that we believe we can tap the whole 

398
00:22:01,861 --> 00:22:04,800
architectural structure of being into 
the positive,

399
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,010
into the positive.
Well,

400
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,613
I would say

401
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,200
no.
If you

402
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,700
drilled down to the bottom of 
existentialism,

403
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:21,130
in some sense that's the question,
the existentialists pose know,

404
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,920
is there a manner of conducting your 
life such that it becomes,

405
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,160
it's not merely acceptable,
it's more than that.

406
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,601
You'd say,
yes,

407
00:22:29,601 --> 00:22:30,800
this is how it should be.

408
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,433
Well,

409
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,670
what we're going to do now,
although we're not going to do it today,

410
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,013
is we're going to start talking about 
other representations of this 

411
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,043
substructure from other religious 
traditions and we're going to also talk 

412
00:22:47,881 --> 00:22:51,240
about ways that you might relate to 
these figures.

413
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,443
You know,
because one question might be while 

414
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,164
you're part of your culture and it's got
an orderly element and a protective 

415
00:22:58,501 --> 00:23:01,050
element and a tear radical element.
Okay,

416
00:23:01,051 --> 00:23:03,570
so what should you do about that?
You know,

417
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,460
should,
you know,

418
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,253
the tyrannical element is a real and 
it's corrupt and blind and so to the 

419
00:23:10,141 --> 00:23:10,974
degree that you identify with that,
well then you're tyrannical and corrupt 

420
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:14,910
and blind.
But by the same token,

421
00:23:14,911 --> 00:23:15,744
you're the fortunate beneficiary of tens
of thousands of years of cultural and 

422
00:23:19,711 --> 00:23:23,940
technological evolution.
And it seems to me that an effort,

423
00:23:23,941 --> 00:23:25,620
it seems to me that,
you know,

424
00:23:25,621 --> 00:23:29,520
you should be at least appropriately 
grateful for that.

425
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:30,683
And so then you're in a real position 
because you have to be grateful and 

426
00:23:32,851 --> 00:23:36,360
happy for the thing that tyrannizing 
controls you.

427
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,560
Well,
okay,

428
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,940
that's not an easy thing to figure out 
because those things seem to conflict.

429
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,980
So what exactly should your relationship
to culture be?

430
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,293
Well,
I think there are myths that describe 

431
00:23:49,741 --> 00:23:54,650
that quite directly and they take into 
account the corruption,

432
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,660
you know,
it's not a whitewash.

433
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:57,830
It's like,
yes,

434
00:23:57,831 --> 00:24:02,831
of course this thing is dead and blind 
and corrupt obviously,

435
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:04,820
and you know,
it's,

436
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,310
it's foolishness and,
and willful

437
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,703
ignorance and willful blindness that 
make it that way as well as things 

438
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,180
merely getting old and falling apart.
So the fact that there's some level,

439
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:20,810
it's at the bottom of it is also true.
Should you flee from Matt?

440
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,063
Well,

441
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,910
that isn't what the myths say.
You know,

442
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,650
they say what you're supposed to do is 
just like Pinocchio.

443
00:24:28,651 --> 00:24:32,660
You're supposed to go to the bottom of 
the ocean to the most monstrous possible

444
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:33,494
part and rescue your father.
And that's what you have to do before 

445
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:37,680
you become an individual.

446
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,500
No,
and

447
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,470
I can't see how that can't be.
Right.

448
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,800
So in fact,
I think that that's what you're doing in

449
00:24:46,801 --> 00:24:48,390
university.
If you're here for,

450
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,540
if you're actually getting a university 
education,

451
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:56,810
what you're here to do is to sift 
through the dad remnants of the past and

452
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,073
pull up what's vital that's so 
sophisticated and complex that there's 

453
00:25:01,741 --> 00:25:04,110
no way you'd be able to think it up for 
yourself.

454
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,900
But you know,
it requires us,

455
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,370
the discriminating agent.
You know,

456
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,180
if you read someone like nature or you 
read someone like Freud,

457
00:25:12,181 --> 00:25:15,870
there's lots to throw away.
It isn't what you throw away though.

458
00:25:15,871 --> 00:25:16,704
It's what you keep that matters.
And to be a discriminating reader means 

459
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:24,501
that you get rid of the dead matter and 
you keep the goal and you build yourself

460
00:25:25,561 --> 00:25:30,180
up a storehouse of the gold and then,
and then you can live in the world.

461
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,480
And when you know,
people often ask,

462
00:25:33,481 --> 00:25:34,314
you know,
what's the purpose of getting a degree 

463
00:25:35,371 --> 00:25:37,680
in the humanities?
While the answer to that is that

464
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,880
if you're properly trained in the 
humanities,

465
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,773
you know how to live now,
that's not the same as having a job and 

466
00:25:47,371 --> 00:25:49,350
you need to have a job,
but,

467
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,633
but you know,
knowing how to live is a more important 

468
00:25:52,921 --> 00:25:56,310
thing than having a job even though 
having a job isn't important thing.

469
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,313
So,
and the reason for that is that if you 

470
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:00,504
don't know how to live,
then things fall apart and that's not 

471
00:26:03,961 --> 00:26:06,360
good and they can really fall apart.
You know,

472
00:26:06,361 --> 00:26:08,670
and part of the reason I think that this
became so,

473
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,613
so much of an obsession for me is that I
believe that we don't have the luxury 

474
00:26:15,061 --> 00:26:18,090
of.
We are narrowing.

475
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:26,410
We've become so powerful that the 
consequence of our blindness will,

476
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:31,740
is reaching uncontrollable proportions.
If you're weak and stupid,

477
00:26:32,561 --> 00:26:33,190
well,
you know,

478
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,970
there's only so much damage you can do,
but we're not weak.

479
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:37,923
Not at all.
We have unbelievable power at our 

480
00:26:41,381 --> 00:26:42,214
disposal now and a lot of weird things 
are going to come down the pipes in the 

481
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:46,770
next 10 years.

482
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,333
So

483
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,640
the more people that have their act 
together,

484
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,223
the better because
then things will be tilted towards 

485
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,913
everything lining up in a positive 
direction rather than being tilted in 

486
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:05,500
the other direction.
And that's important.

487
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:09,580
And I think people can make a very 
powerful individual contribution to that

488
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,200
wherever you happen to be.

489
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,813
So

490
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,353
you know,
all of these myths always say the same 

491
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,720
thing.
They say that the history,

492
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:24,200
the future of the world depends on 
individual choice.

493
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,480
And I think that's,
I think that's literally true.

494
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,573
So then you might think,
well you better put yourself in a 

495
00:27:33,021 --> 00:27:35,780
position where you make wise choices 
because if you don't,

496
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:39,903
we've already seen what happens.
We got a taste of it in the 20th 

497
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:45,400
century,
so if you want some more of that,

498
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,100
you could certainly have it.

499
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,990
Okay.
So.
