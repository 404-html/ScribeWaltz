00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,363
Hello.
So some of you may have heard about the 

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,960
Google memo at his been circulating 
virally around the Internet for the last

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,200
couple of days.
That was written by James Damore who was

4
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:21,201
fired for it last night.
And a colleague of his reached out to me

5
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:22,734
and put us together.
And so I'm going to talk to James today 

6
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:30,240
about exactly what happened and why and 
perhaps what should be done about it.

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,403
So all,
so that's what we're going to do in the 

8
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:41,100
interview I had with him,
which finished at about three o'clock on

9
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,263
Tuesday,
August 8th follows immediately after 

10
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:48,600
this introduction.
Hi everybody.

11
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:49,434
I'm speaking today with James Demore and
an unidentified google employee who 

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,250
wishes to remain anonymous.
Um,

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,953
reasons that I think are obvious.
And James last week put his hand in a 

14
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:06,774
blender by circulating an internal memo 
that I would say has become somewhat 

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,230
infamous.
So James,

16
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:14,064
let's start with,
let's start with a bit of discussion 

17
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:19,020
about you to tell us who you are,
about your background,

18
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:20,550
and about what you were doing at Google.

19
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,930
Yeah.
So I,

20
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,900
I was actually just,
you know,

21
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,743
I'm really interested in science and 
psychology and stuff and then I really 

22
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:34,450
like puzzles and that's how I got into 
Google.

23
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:36,760
Actually.
I did one of their coding competitions.

24
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:41,410
They just recruited me out of that.
And so I Google,

25
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:46,090
I was mostly working on search and image
and video search in particular.

26
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,643
So what's,
tell us about your educational 

27
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:50,614
background a bit.

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,490
Okay.

29
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,323
Yeah.
So I just did a random science and math 

30
00:01:57,391 --> 00:02:00,240
and undergrad and I ended up with a 
degree.

31
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:01,770
I didn't really know what I was going to
do.

32
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,970
So I started doing research at Mit and 
then,

33
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,800
uh,
I went to a systems biology at Harvard.

34
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,380
I initially wanted to work with Martin 
Nowak.

35
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,070
He's really great at and evolution and 
Game Theory.

36
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,370
But,
uh,

37
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,830
then I started working on other things.
Okay.

38
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,780
So tell us a bit about systems biology.
What is that exactly?

39
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,670
What kind of research were you doing at 
Mit?

40
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,650
Yeah,
so it sounds,

41
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:31,484
biology has many different meanings,
but it's generally just mathematical 

42
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:36,554
biology and uh,
I guess seeing biological systems as a 

43
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:44,480
whole rather than just individual 
molecules.

44
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,610
And so I,
I liked looking at populations and so my

45
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:50,690
interest in evolution.

46
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,390
So why did that make you a viable 
candidate and doodle?

47
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,323
It's eight.

48
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,070
Uh,
I think they just

49
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:05,070
saw a smart guy that could code.
Now you've been there three years,

50
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:08,890
is that correct?
But also has an intern before that.

51
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,180
Yeah.
So about four years total.

52
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,483
And so how would you say you've 
performed as an employee and doable and 

53
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,440
people being happy with you?
Or have you been here?

54
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,730
No,
I got promoted twice.

55
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,390
My last review was the highest possible.
Superb,

56
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,450
which is the top few percent aisle.
So I,

57
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,410
it definitely wasn't based on 
performance that they fired me.

58
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,430
Have you enjoyed working at Google?
Has it been a good experience?

59
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,140
Yeah,
I mean I love Google then.

60
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,900
That's horrible part.
Like I've always been the biggest google

61
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,850
fanboy,
all like,

62
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:49,420
I've never had an iphone.
I've always tried to convince my friends

63
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:51,460
to use android and all of these 
different things.

64
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,150
And yeah,
I mean this is just puts a sour taste in

65
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:58,180
my mouth.

66
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,810
Okay.
So,

67
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,970
so you've got a good educational 
background.

68
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:03,550
You were interested in things that 
Google would be interested in.

69
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,613
You're a good coder,
you've worked with them for a number of 

70
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,983
years.
We've done an excellent job and you're 

71
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:11,230
pretty pro google.
That's basically the background.

72
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:16,990
Okay.
Now last week you wrote a memo which has

73
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:20,740
attracted a tremendous amount of 
attention and in that memo you,

74
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,280
you made a number of claims and the 
claims were,

75
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,440
and please correct me if I've got this,
if I'm not summarizing this properties,

76
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,980
you were attempting to describe reasons 
why there might,

77
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,370
why a lack of gender parity might exist 
within Google for example with an NGO in

78
00:04:38,371 --> 00:04:41,650
engineering or broadly but also in 
patients more broadly.

79
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,023
And um,
you laid out in a very elaborated 

80
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:49,180
document and I reviewed it and as far as
I can tell,

81
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,990
your opinions are well supported by the 
relevant psychological science.

82
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:59,440
And I think what I'll do in the 
description of this video when I link it

83
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:03,130
is putting the references so that people
can decide for themselves.

84
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:05,830
I want to put up a web page about gender
differences in general,

85
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:09,730
but I'll try to hit the highlights for 
this particular document.

86
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:12,220
So why did you do this?

87
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,860
Yeah,
so about a month and a half ago,

88
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,783
I went to one of our diversity summits,
all of it unrecorded and to proceed 

89
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,074
credit.
And they told me a lot of things that I 

90
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,580
thought just were not right.

91
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,703
Okay.
What do you mean unrecorded in super 

92
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:34,750
secret?
Okay.

93
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,663
Well,
I mean they were telling us about a lot 

94
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:37,824
of these potentially illegal practices 
that they've been doing to try to 

95
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:44,950
increase diversity.
And

96
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,010
what kind of practices?

97
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,473
Uh,
well basically treating people 

98
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,130
differently based on what their race or 
gender ours.

99
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,920
Yeah.
Basically.

100
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:57,980
I

101
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,761
see.
And so,

102
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:00,880
and it was ultra secret,
an unrecorded.

103
00:06:00,881 --> 00:06:01,730
And in what manner?

104
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,030
Uh,
yeah,

105
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,130
so I,
most meetings I Google,

106
00:06:06,131 --> 00:06:08,890
I recorded anyone at Google come watch 
it.

107
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:12,280
We're trying to be really open about 
everything except for this.

108
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,450
They don't want any paper trail for any 
of these things.

109
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,943
Okay.
Why?

110
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,830
Because I think it's illegal and I mean,
as some of the internal polls showed,

111
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,920
there were a large percent of people 
that agreed with me on the document.

112
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,580
And so if everyone got to see this 
stuff,

113
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,100
then they would really bringing up some 
criticism.

114
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,790
Yeah.
A large number of people in Google and a

115
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,930
very large number of well-informed 
biological scientists we might also add.

116
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,363
So I mean it was quite,
I was quite struck by your document 

117
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,390
given that no,
it would have been a decent document for

118
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:56,420
a well informed psychologist,
research psychologists to write,

119
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:59,120
but it was somewhat of an outsider.
But you've got the,

120
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,570
you got the highlights accurate as far 
as I'm concerned.

121
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:03,440
So,
okay.

122
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:04,274
So you went to this diversity meeting 
and you weren't happy with the sorts of 

123
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:10,830
things that you were being told and with
the practices is,

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,010
is that both correct?
Yeah.

125
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,480
And what were you mean tool?

126
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,911
Uh,
well,

127
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:17,744
so that
I think there's a lot of ways in which 

128
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:25,880
they pressure people to increase the 
diversity of their team.

129
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,493
And you know,
there's no way to do that besides 

130
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,330
actually choosing someone based on their
race or gender.

131
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:33,164
Right.

132
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,980
I don't lucidity precisely,

133
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,123
uh,
I more women or underrepresented racial 

134
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:43,980
minorities.

135
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,920
Can I jump in?
Yeah.

136
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,040
I would hesitate to say that that's 100%
true across 100%.

137
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:56,410
Right.
So the organization that I'm in,

138
00:07:56,411 --> 00:08:01,090
I have not personally seen anything that
I would deem crossed the line.

139
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,470
Um,
you know,

140
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,363
I personally believe that there are a 
good amount of synergies to be found if 

141
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,800
you can combine,
you know,

142
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,220
slightly different ideologies,
um,

143
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,600
into a room.
And that is the,

144
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,750
the thesis that some groups are working 
towards.

145
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:17,883
Um,
obviously there's going to be a 

146
00:08:18,941 --> 00:08:22,930
distribution of how people follow the 
rules.

147
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,820
Um,
and you know,

148
00:08:24,821 --> 00:08:28,030
it's unfortunate to hear that it's,
you know,

149
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:31,690
it could be that some people fall to the
wrong side of that distribution,

150
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,140
but that's certainly wouldn't,
it would not apply to everybody.

151
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,543
It certainly also distressing to hear 
that there is acceptance of the idea 

152
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:44,910
that diversity can be mapped on to race 
and gender,

153
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:45,744
especially with regards to performance 
because there's no evidence for that 

154
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:49,740
whatsoever.
So.

155
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:50,574
Okay.
So you went to this meeting and then 

156
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,573
you,
you just started to write this document 

157
00:08:54,091 --> 00:08:55,000
and,
um,

158
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,140
how long had you been working on it 
before he released it?

159
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,451
Uh,
yeah.

160
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:03,590
So I was doing it like throughout my 
free time.

161
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,160
I,
and I just wanted to clarify my thoughts

162
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:10,580
on this and I really just want it to be 
proven wrong because you know,

163
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,400
if what I was saying was right,
then something bad is happening.

164
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,953
And so yeah,
about a month ago I submitted it to 

165
00:09:17,811 --> 00:09:22,010
feedback to that program and you know,
I saw that people looked at it,

166
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,170
but no one actually said anything.

167
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,400
And what's your,
and then did you submit,

168
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,530
uh,
I basically said what I said in the,

169
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,380
in the document and then I linked to the
document itself.

170
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,593
And so I actually published this about a
month ago and it was only after it got 

171
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:45,870
viral and then we,
to the news that Google started caring.

172
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,353
Can you,
so how did it go viral and do you know 

173
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:50,270
and how was it leaked?

174
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Yeah,
so I,

175
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,770
there was a group at Google called 
skeptics and so I was like,

176
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,560
okay,
maybe there'll be able to prove me wrong

177
00:10:00,561 --> 00:10:01,394
in some way.
Like there's Scott's a rule about 

178
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:03,380
things,
right?

179
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,230
I wasn't naive,
I guess.

180
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,810
And so I sent them a message like,
okay,

181
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,673
what do you think about this?
Is Google in some sort of echo chamber 

182
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:16,240
or I'm crying and echo chamber.
And

183
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,890
then it just exploded after that.
And you know,

184
00:10:20,891 --> 00:10:23,450
our internal,
yeah.

185
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,840
It was just spread throughout.
I've all of Google.

186
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,970
Do you and do you know,
was it the,

187
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,970
was it the skeptic's group that started 
to spread it around?

188
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,023
Yeah.
And then there were a lot of upper 

189
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:39,340
management that uh,
you know,

190
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,183
specifically called it out and start 
saying how harmful it is and how is 

191
00:10:43,821 --> 00:10:48,080
unacceptable.
This sort of viewpoint is not allowed at

192
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:48,980
Google.

193
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,350
Yeah.
What sort of viewpoint,

194
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:51,184
exactly.
The idea that there were differences 

195
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:55,410
between men and women that actually 
might play a role in,

196
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,613
in,
in,

197
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,500
in,
in the,

198
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,333
in the,
in the corporate world that that's an 

199
00:10:59,831 --> 00:11:01,480
opinion that's not acceptable.

200
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,460
Yeah,
it seems,

201
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,930
well,
I know,

202
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,630
you know,
understandably it is,

203
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,850
these issues are tricky morally and 
politically,

204
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,013
but thing that was disturbing to me 
about watching the response to you is 

205
00:11:16,231 --> 00:11:17,064
that as far as I can tell,
there isn't anything that you said in 

206
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,400
that paper.
First of all,

207
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:21,234
that is in fact biased in a manner that 
should open you up to the sorts of 

208
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:25,644
charges that had been opened up against 
you or that violates the scientific 

209
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:33,930
literature as it currently stands.
So both of those are rather distressing.

210
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,680
Yeah.
And there was a lot of misrepresentation

211
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:42,040
by upper management just to silence may 
I think?

212
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,620
Yes.
And why is that do you think?

213
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,454
Like why?
Why is it the Google couldn't have 

214
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,374
actually,
do you think that Google couldn't have 

215
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:51,070
come out and have an intelligent 
discussion about this instead of,

216
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,690
well,
first of all,

217
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,930
releasing like Dan,
I Read Danielle Brown's response to you,

218
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:57,940
which I thought was absolutely 
appalling,

219
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,540
down to appalling.
And then they fired you,

220
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,670
which seems to be like really bad pr 
move,

221
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:06,400
but more importantly,
it doesn't actually deal with the issues

222
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:07,840
at hand.
You know,

223
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:10,630
they're basically saying something like,
well,

224
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:12,760
what was the rationale for firing you?
Exactly.

225
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:14,350
What was the excuse that was given?

226
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:19,490
So the official excuse was that I was 
perpetuating gender stereotypes

227
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,320
that you were perpetuating gender 
stereotypes.

228
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:23,760
Yeah.
And it,

229
00:12:23,761 --> 00:12:24,594
did they say anything else about your 
performance or about anything else that 

230
00:12:26,971 --> 00:12:27,804
you had done?

231
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,590
Okay.

232
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,180
No,
it was,

233
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,620
that was the only reason.

234
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:32,681
And who,
who,

235
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:34,470
who fired you?
Technically?

236
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,193
Uh,
it was my hr representative and my 

237
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:40,624
director.

238
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,860
Okay.
And do you end,

239
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,773
do you have any idea on who's ordered as
they were acting or if this was 

240
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:50,040
something that they conjured up 
themselves or,

241
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,703
hi,
I'm sure I probably went from higher up 

242
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,440
than that because I'm,
this is a huge pr move.

243
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,640
So they would need approval from higher 
ups.

244
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,400
Right.
And I think the CEO,

245
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,283
the CEO,
actually made some comments about the 

246
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,783
issue today,
which I'll probably cut into this video 

247
00:13:09,891 --> 00:13:11,600
as we,
as I edited.

248
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,340
So,
yeah.

249
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,450
Okay.
All right.

250
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:18,110
So the first question is,
how are you doing?

251
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,070
I'm doing okay.
I,

252
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:22,923
there's a lot of messages that I'm 
trying to sort through and just trying 

253
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:28,770
to figure out what I should do now.
But

254
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,933
yeah,
you've been given some interesting job 

255
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:33,700
offers as far as I can tell.

256
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,153
Yeah,
I've gotten a surprising amount as a 

257
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:38,200
part.
Yeah.

258
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,101
Yeah.
Well,

259
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:39,934
I suspect I'm sacked.
I'm virtually certain that you have a 

260
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:43,444
majority viewpoint.
It's just at the people who hold the 

261
00:13:45,821 --> 00:13:46,654
alternative perspective,
which are the radical social 

262
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:50,134
constructionist types who insist that 
everything is a consequence of 

263
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:53,194
socialization.
There are a little bit more organized 

264
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:56,860
politically,
but there are clearly wrong,

265
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:57,694
scientifically they're wrong.
So actually the wrong ethically for 

266
00:14:00,431 --> 00:14:02,170
that.
So,

267
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,663
so you,
you probably have more support than you 

268
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:07,600
sake and it'll be very interesting to 
see how that turns out.

269
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,393
So,
so what do you think about having 

270
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:12,274
written this are mean now your life is 
going to be turned upside down and for 

271
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:16,324
quite a while I suspect.
So you put yourself out on the line 

272
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,120
doing this.
So what do you think about that?

273
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:32,020
It definitely sucks,
but I mean at least I was proven right.

274
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,610
You know,

275
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,140
when,
what do you mean by proven right?

276
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,583
Oh,
just that the whole culture just tries 

277
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,820
to silence.
I need a dissenting view

278
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,840
and then we really need some more 
objective way of looking at these.

279
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,393
Yeah,
well I felt the same way with the 

280
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,750
University of Toronto decided to,
you know,

281
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,590
an attempt to shut me down after I need 
my videos.

282
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:02,480
I thought,
well that just proves my point.

283
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,120
Yeah.
Cause I mean to me the video saying well

284
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:05,954
I don't like the climate that's 
developing and it's making it very 

285
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:10,250
difficult to have conversations about 
certain things.

286
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:14,720
And your examples even more egregious I 
think because you know,

287
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:19,721
I at least objected to a piece of 
legislation that in principle would have

288
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:24,590
been a benefit to an identifiable group.
But say the transgender group,

289
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,420
I don't believe it is of any benefit to 
them,

290
00:15:26,421 --> 00:15:29,540
but you could make a case that it was,
but you,

291
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:33,500
all you did as far as I can tell it is 
review the modern personality literature

292
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:34,903
and the literature on individual 
differences relating to men and women 

293
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,183
and other groups.
And there's actually not very much 

294
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,693
opinion in your piece at all.
So what that does is that it is not 

295
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:50,741
possible to actually have a discussion 
about the scientific literature on these

296
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:52,184
issues without putting yourself at risk.
And that's a hell of a thing for an 

297
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:59,621
engineer because being engineers and 
rely on the facts as far as I can tell,

298
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:01,934
and one of the things I liked about 
engineers is that they tend to stick 

299
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:07,910
fairly closely to the facts that they're
not a very political group.

300
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,700
You know?
Generally speaking,

301
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,070
they're much more practical.

302
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:15,880
Yeah.

303
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,713
I,
I don't know how that can expect a 

304
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:23,171
silence so many engineers then 
intelligent people and just

305
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,960
deny science.
Like it's like

306
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,580
this.
Yeah.

307
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:30,210
Well the question too is what are you 
supporters within Google going to do?

308
00:16:30,211 --> 00:16:31,044
Because you know,
I would say you're a great warning then 

309
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,850
because you,
you showed what happened,

310
00:16:38,851 --> 00:16:41,970
you showed exactly what happens if you 
have enough,

311
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:49,060
I don't know what you'd call it,
curiosity and courage I suppose,

312
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,550
but,
but mostly curiosity to lay out what you

313
00:16:53,551 --> 00:16:55,740
think for discussion.
I mean,

314
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,620
you opened this conversation,
you said that,

315
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,753
you know,
you weren't jumping up and down and 

316
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:02,244
insisting you were right.
You were trying to lay out what you 

317
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,090
understood from doing a fair bit of 
reading and,

318
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,980
and make the case that the,
these facts,

319
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,053
the facts about the differences between 
men and women and employment choice and 

320
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,653
payment and all that aren't being 
discussed and they're not being 

321
00:17:18,061 --> 00:17:20,130
discussed.
I mean we know for example,

322
00:17:20,131 --> 00:17:20,964
and I'll put this citation in down in 
the description that's been very 

323
00:17:24,271 --> 00:17:27,240
difficult for the,
the Swedes for example,

324
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:28,074
to flatten out the gender distribution 
for engineers in Sweden and in and in 

325
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,260
and in the Scandinavian countries in 
general,

326
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,680
despite their advanced social 
engineering,

327
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,280
let's call it.

328
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,900
And they also can't get male nurses.
You know,

329
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,040
I think it's four out of five nurses in 
Scandinavia,

330
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,020
if I remember correctly,
are female.

331
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,190
And the reverse number are our engineers
are male.

332
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,953
And you know,
that seems to be associated with this 

333
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,540
quite well founded.
Um,

334
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,033
scientific observation that women tilt 
towards interest in people and men tilt 

335
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:04,194
towards interest in things and that 
that's associated with testosterone 

336
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:10,870
exposure in utero.
This is so much science.

337
00:18:10,871 --> 00:18:11,704
You know what?
It isn't anybody beating an ideological 

338
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:14,274
trump because most of the people,
I would say that most of the people who 

339
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:19,590
are publishing this would have been even
happier.

340
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:22,470
How did turn out the other way?
You know,

341
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,603
the findings actually run contrary to 
their biases because academia is 

342
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,290
generally full of people whose biases 
are left and now and then,

343
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,800
you know,
scientific findings emerged to dispute,

344
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:35,940
um,
uh,

345
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,773
nydia logical proposition,
not certainly the case with the role of 

346
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:43,230
biology versus society in establishing 
gender differences.

347
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:44,064
So the science is very credible.
It doesn't mean it's completely beyond 

348
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:48,174
dispute,
but that's not the point either because 

349
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:51,594
your survey was actually pretty decent 
survey of the current state of affairs 

350
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:57,600
with regards to individual differences.
That doesn't mean it's right.

351
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,600
So,
okay,

352
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:01,680
so what,
what are your,

353
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,600
what are your,
what does your family think about all of

354
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:04,434
this?

355
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,370
Yeah,
they definitely support me,

356
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,670
but they don't really know what I should
do from here.

357
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:12,504
They don't want me to just go to a ton 
of news corporations and do all these 

358
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:20,310
interviews and stuff and because they 
just want a twist,

359
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:23,740
whatever I say towards their agenda to 
it's,

360
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,620
it's not really clear what I should be 
doing.

361
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,133
Yeah.
Well there's certainly no shortage of 

362
00:19:27,981 --> 00:19:29,420
people that want to talk to you.
I mean,

363
00:19:29,421 --> 00:19:33,740
I'd been contacted by four or five 
journalists who would like to speak with

364
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:34,770
you.
Um,

365
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,670
we can talk about that afterwards.
I could like to know who they are,

366
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,620
but um,
yeah.

367
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:40,460
Well,
you've got a,

368
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,390
you've got a conundrum on your hands.
Nope.

369
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,940
I mean you're,
you're a,

370
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,780
you're a very straightforward person and
you're obviously not grinding any acts,

371
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:58,760
at least not in any obvious way.
So my suspicions are that talking to the

372
00:19:58,761 --> 00:20:01,250
right people could be of substantial use
to you.

373
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:05,240
But I guess it also depends on what it 
is that you want me.

374
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,360
And that's something we can talk about.
Now you've,

375
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,593
you've,

376
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,443
you've rattled up the cages,
a fair number of people and a fairly 

377
00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:16,120
large organization.
Interestingly enough,

378
00:20:16,121 --> 00:20:16,954
just on the heels of Google and Youtube 
is announcement about the new free 

379
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:21,940
speech restrictions on,
on Youtube,

380
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,833
you know,
when and their incorporation of NGOs 

381
00:20:24,311 --> 00:20:25,144
into that sensor set process.
So it's been quite a week for Google I 

382
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:32,080
would say.
So you've opened up this can of worms.

383
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,560
What is it?
Yeah.

384
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,970
So imagine if you're looking six months 
down the road and say,

385
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:41,440
and things happened that were good 
because of what you did,

386
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,110
what is it that you would like to have 
happen?

387
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,620
Huh.
I,

388
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,590
I at the very least I want,
because I do still care about google.

389
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:51,424
I want some conversation to be had and 
for the ideologues to not just have 

390
00:20:57,701 --> 00:21:01,270
their way,
but yeah,

391
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:06,271
I still don't have a clear vision on how
exactly this will happen and how,

392
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,780
how this can spread farther than just 
google.

393
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,880
You spread it farther than just google,
that's for sure.

394
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:15,900
Yeah.
You know?

395
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,761
Um,
I mean,

396
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:17,594
I would say my experiences with the 
premise is that the first thing that 

397
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:27,531
happens that will happen is that you'll 
get jumped on by people who call you the

398
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,454
sorts of epithets that would be 
appropriate if you were a bad guy and 

399
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,680
you should just shut up and go away.
