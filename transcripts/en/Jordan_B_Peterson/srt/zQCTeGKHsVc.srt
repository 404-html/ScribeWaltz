1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,833
Sometimes there's a glitch in the matrix
where the limitations of the old 

2
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:14,190
operating system and laid bare and 
something new pokes through.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,553
There's been dozens of responses to the 
Jordan Peterson Channel Four interview 

4
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:21,630
already.
What makes this one different?

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,050
Well,
I have a pretty unique perspective.

6
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,790
In October last year I went to Toronto 
to interview Jordan Peterson,

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,880
this home from where I came in from 
London last night.

8
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,283
I turned the interview into the first 
full length documentary about Jordan 

9
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:44,250
Peterson's ideas.
I was pretty sure he'd soon become a lot

10
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:48,690
more famous and be recognized as one of 
the most significant public thinkers,

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,850
but I couldn't possibly have predicted 
how he breakthrough to a mass audience.

12
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,900
A few weeks later Peter's and did an 
interview with journalists,

13
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:00,510
Kathy Newman on channel four news in the
UK,

14
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,700
a program I worked on as reporter and 
producer for 10 years.

15
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,920
It was a sensation.
Millions watched it online,

16
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,780
tens of thousands commented and 
overwhelming majority felt.

17
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:20,781
Peterson had been unfairly represented
and in the week since it hasn't stopped,

18
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,523
Peterson has been asked about it 
constantly on the most high profile 

19
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:32,690
online shows 12 rules for life.
So without reading this.

20
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,093
So what you're saying is sort of like 
there's only 12 things you need to know 

21
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:38,781
in like,
right?

22
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:39,710
That's it.
Yeah.

23
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:40,880
Well yeah.
This,

24
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:41,714
um,
this interview that you just did with 

25
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:47,690
this woman kathy new mission was that in
the UK it was channel four UK.

26
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:48,923
So what does this glitch say about the 
state of mainstream media and the 

27
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:54,360
culture at large?

28
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,233
My diagnosis of what's actually 
happening is that people are moving 

29
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,513
further and further away from what is 
what thinking actually is at more and 

30
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,690
more into merely running a script.

31
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,190
And what does Jordan Peterson actually 
think?

32
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,453
It's so controversial.
You are misrepresented more than anyone 

33
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,050
I know,
you know,

34
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,240
weird way.
You are villainized in a weird way where

35
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,103
um,
I can't believe that these people are 

36
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:29,551
honestly looking at your opinions and 
coming up with these conclusions.

37
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,293
I believe this encounter struck such a 
nerve because it's a cultural watershed 

38
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:38,170
moment scene properly as Peterson would 
say.

39
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,610
It's archetypal in that it contains 
layers and layers of meaning

40
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,123
that go right to the heart of the 
biggest rift we're seeing play out in 

41
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:48,994
the culture over the next 50 minutes.
I'm going to do my best to unpack it 

42
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,960
from the clash between new and old 
media.

43
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,740
There's also why Youtube is going to 
kill tv because

44
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,600
television,
by its nature,

45
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,920
all of these narrow broadcast 
technologies,

46
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,800
they re they rely on forcing the story

47
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,000
all the way down to the mythological an 
archetype or level.

48
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,980
I thought of videology says fragmentary 
mythologies.

49
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:16,843
That's where they get their archetype 
will in psychological power in the 

50
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,263
postmodern world.
And this seems to be something that's 

51
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:25,100
increasingly seeping out into the 
culture at large.

52
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:27,350
You have nothing but the tyrannical 
father.

53
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,363
Nothing but the destructive force of 
masculine consciousness and nothing but 

54
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:34,910
the benevolent,
benevolent great mother.

55
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:35,744
And it's uh,
it's an appalling ideology and it seems 

56
00:03:37,821 --> 00:03:41,870
to me that it's sucking the vitality,
which is exactly what you'd expect.

57
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:44,570
Symbolically.
It's sucking the vitality of our culture

58
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,553
until off.
How do we move forward constructively 

59
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,030
rather than just adding to the 
polarization.

60
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:55,570
I've been a journalist for 16 years in 
the newsroom of the BBC and channel four

61
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,980
and then making documentaries.
I moved away from the front line of news

62
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:03,770
sometime ago and started learning 
psychology,

63
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,780
which is what first drew me to Jordan 
Peterson from a distance.

64
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,973
I've started to see the blind spots of 
the establishment media much more 

65
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:13,484
clearly.
I spent some of the best years of my 

66
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:16,454
working life at channel four news and 
have a huge amount of respect and 

67
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:20,174
gratitude to the program.
But I'm making this film because I feel 

68
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,554
so strongly that if we can't have open 
conversations about the kind of topics 

69
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:30,410
Peterson is raising,
we're in serious trouble.

70
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,850
My book went up to number two and on 
amazon.com in the u s the next day,

71
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,200
right?
It's number one in Canada.

72
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:39,330
It's number three in the UK.
All on Amazon.

73
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,360
I couldn't have asked for more 
publicity.

74
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,463
Right?
And so I could also be sitting back and 

75
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:45,691
saying,
well,

76
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:46,524
you know,
she tried to my a person who regarded 

77
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:50,394
herself as my ideological opponent tried
to go after my philosophy and my 

78
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:54,954
reputation on national TV failed 
brutally and has been taken apart for 

79
00:05:00,211 --> 00:05:01,860
it.
It's like this is a good day,

80
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,400
but I don't regard it as a good day.
I don't think it's a good day.

81
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,960
I think that it's evidence of the 
instability of the times that we're in.

82
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,213
It would have been much better for me 
and for everyone else if what we would 

83
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:19,024
have had was a real conversation.
You said that it's actually a sign of 

84
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:25,770
the times where things could go really 
wrong for all of us really soon.

85
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:26,761
Yeah,
we're,

86
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:28,770
we're playing with fire and what do you 
mean by this?

87
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:30,000
Can you,
can you elaborate?

88
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,243
Well,
things go wrong and cultures all the 

89
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:33,954
time,
right?

90
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,860
You get,
you get the polarization increases until

91
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:39,300
people start to act it out.

92
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,473
Peterson is one of the new breed of 
thinkers made famous almost completely 

93
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:46,314
by the Internet,
not the broadcast media arts of a 

94
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:54,291
powerful new informal network being 
called the intellectual dark web and the

95
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:58,100
mainstream media is based on an old 
model that

96
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,100
is being replaced by new media and new 
technology so quickly that it's false or

97
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:06,260
becoming glaringly obvious.
Fortunately,

98
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:10,550
thanks to Youtube podcasting and however
else you get shows like this one,

99
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,790
the mainstream media stranglehold on 
information,

100
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,653
which really is a stranglehold on your 
ability to think clearly about the 

101
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:21,050
issues of the day is crumbling at an 
incredible rate.

102
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,860
Now the question is who and what will 
replace it?

103
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,113
A few months ago,
one of my favorite people to sit across 

104
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:31,460
this table from Eric Weinstein came up 
with the phrase intellectual dark web to

105
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:35,150
describe this eclectic mix of people 
from Sam Harris to Ben Shapiro,

106
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:37,880
to his brother,
Bret Weinstein to Jordan Peterson,

107
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:38,803
all of whom are figuring out ways to 
have the important and often dangerous 

108
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:45,140
conversations that are completely 
ignored by the mainstream.

109
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,213
It's why I would argue that this 
collection of people are actually more 

110
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:51,830
influential at this point than whatever 
collection of cable news pundits you can

111
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:52,664
come up with.
If you think I'm being hyperbolic about 

112
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,664
the growing influence of this group,
just check the traction that these 

113
00:06:57,891 --> 00:07:01,940
people get on twitter or facebook 
compared to our mainstream competitors.

114
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,030
Twitter may not be real life as I say in
my twitter bio,

115
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:08,630
but it is some barometer of what the 
Zeitgeists is right now.

116
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,793
What unites this group of thinkers is a 
sense that the set of ideas that have 

117
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:14,084
run western culture for years are 
breaking down and that the chaos of the 

118
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:23,261
moment is the attempt to find new ones.
It's nearly all happening online.

119
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,310
Part of the problem that we have right 
now in our culture is trying to diagnose

120
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:29,144
the level at which the discussion should
be taking place and I think the reason 

121
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:32,684
that this is a tumultuous time is 
because it actually is a time for 

122
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:40,130
discussion of first principles and it's,
it's that first principles are virtually

123
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:41,720
at the level of theology,
right?

124
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,220
Because first principles are the things 
that you assume and then move forward.

125
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:46,641
It's like,
well,

126
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:49,610
what should we assume while the dignity 
of the human soul?

127
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,683
But start with that.
You can't treat yourself properly 

128
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:55,160
without assuming that you can't have a 
relationship with another person.

129
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,670
You can't stabilize your family.
You can't have a functional society.

130
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,610
So what does it mean for this human soul
to have dignity?

131
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,683
Well,
the part of the idea is that you're 

132
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:05,054
participating in creation itself,
and you do that with your actions in 

133
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:08,594
your language,
and you get to decide whether you're 

134
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:13,580
tilting the world a bit more towards 
heaven or a bit more towards hell.

135
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,503
And that's actually what you're doing.
So that's a place where the literal in 

136
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:20,600
the metaphorical truth come together.
And people are very,

137
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,183
they're terrified of that idea as they 
should be because it's a massive 

138
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:25,940
responsibility.

139
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,340
They also argue that the central problem
is polarization boosted by social media.

140
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,870
Peterson's work looks at how people are 
hardwired to see the world differently.

141
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:42,370
A lot of what determines your political 
orientation is biological temperament,

142
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,670
far more than people realize.
So for example,

143
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,720
left leaning people liberals let's say,
although that's kind of Miss Misnomer,

144
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,613
but we'll keep with the terminology.
Liberals are high in a trait called 

145
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:00,390
openness,
which is one of the big five personality

146
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:01,224
traits and it's associated with interest
in abstraction and interest in 

147
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:05,364
aesthetics.
It's the best predictor of liberal 

148
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,580
political leaning and they're low in 
trait conscientiousness,

149
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:15,300
which is due to fullness and and 
orderliness in particular.

150
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,400
Whereas the conservatives are the 
opposite.

151
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:18,234
They're high in conscientiousness,
their due to in orderly and they're low 

152
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:24,570
in openness and that makes them really 
good managers and administrators,

153
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,463
administrators and often businessmen,
but not very good entrepreneurs because 

154
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:31,590
the entrepreneurs are almost all drawn 
from the liberal types.

155
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,903
And so these are really fundamental 
fundamentally biologically predicated 

156
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:38,064
differences.
And there you might think about them as 

157
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:44,430
different sets of,
of opportunities and limitations and and

158
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:45,264
certainly different ways of screening 
the world and each of those different 

159
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:50,880
temperamental types needs.

160
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,790
The other type,
let's call this a diversity issue.

161
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,103
If you start understanding that the 
person that you're talking to who 

162
00:09:57,421 --> 00:10:02,421
doesn't share your political views isn't
stupid,

163
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:05,190
that's the first thing necessarily.
They might be,

164
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:06,810
but so might you be,
no.

165
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:07,644
Stupidity isn't.
The differences in intelligence are not 

166
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:13,260
the prime determinant of differences in 
political belief.

167
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,040
All right,
so you might be talking to someone who's

168
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,070
more conscientious and less creative 
than you if you're,

169
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,550
if you happen to be a liberal,
but that doesn't mean that that person's

170
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:24,384
perspective is not valid and it doesn't 
mean that they wouldn't outperform you 

171
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:28,464
in some domains because they would.
So one thing to remember is people 

172
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,730
actually do see the world differently.
It's not merely that they,

173
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,690
that they're possessively of of ill,
he informed opinions.

174
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,453
The whole point of the deal of a 
democracy is to continue the dialogue 

175
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:45,534
between people of different 
temperamental types so that we don't 

176
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:48,984
move so far to the right that everything
becomes encapsulated and stone and 

177
00:10:53,371 --> 00:10:54,204
doesn't move or so far to the left that 
everything dissolves in a kind of a 

178
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,770
mealy mouth chaos.
And the only way that you can,

179
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,600
you can navigate between those two 
scholls is by is through discussion,

180
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:09,330
which is why free speech is such an 
important value.

181
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,493
It's the thing that keeps the 
temperamental types from being at each 

182
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:13,320
other's throats.

183
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,450
In the aftermath of the trump election,
that came as such a shock to most of the

184
00:11:17,451 --> 00:11:18,284
media.
One of the most widely shared analysis 

185
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:21,074
pieces was from deep code.
It describes how the establishment 

186
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,223
mainstream media perspective based 
around liberal values of openness and 

187
00:11:32,221 --> 00:11:33,054
inclusivity he calls the blue church is 
being challenged by a new web based 

188
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:38,664
insurgency,
a red religion based on the values of 

189
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:42,804
tribalism.

190
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,503
The Culture Wars of the 20th century was
a decisive success for blue and a 

191
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,950
effectively a route for

192
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,873
red.
So what we see first is that red was 

193
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:01,870
forced to move into a deeply exploratory
phase.

194
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,590
Second that it did this in a context 
where as it turns out,

195
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,800
things were changing meaningfully,
quite significantly.

196
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:13,090
In fact,
it from my perspective,

197
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:13,924
they in a world historical level,
the emergence of entirely new forms of 

198
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,450
communication and therefore entirely new
forms of sense making and coherence.

199
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,173
He concludes that the blue church is in 
the process of collapse as its dominant 

200
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:31,260
ideology can't adapt to changing 
reality,

201
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,220
but that a combination of the two sets 
of values of blue and red is essential.

202
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,160
We are conscious,
yeah,

203
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,720
and effective in the world in groups not
as individuals.

204
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,853
And the ingredients of those groups
include aspects that are currently 

205
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:54,260
showing up as both red and blue.
Um,

206
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,093
I propose somewhat strongly that uh,
either red nor blue is pure elements 

207
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,850
contain the ingredients necessary to 
actually be adaptive to reality.

208
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,070
Um,
this is a disaster.

209
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,670
In fact,
um,

210
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:17,690
it's a little bit like mmm.
Separating the hand in the eye.

211
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:18,891
You know,
you're the,

212
00:13:18,891 --> 00:13:21,080
I can see if the eye takes itself as 
being,

213
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:21,914
the essence of virtue is separates 
itself from the ability to do the same 

214
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:26,870
thing with the hand.
For most of human history,

215
00:13:26,871 --> 00:13:27,704
these groups have actually always 
commingled there necessary that they 

216
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:32,030
actually relate to each other in a 
deeply healthy,

217
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,860
uh,
and direct fashion.

218
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,223
Uh,
their separation into armed camps is 

219
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,390
extinction are actually,

220
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,463
do you live the values of red that you 
think blue needs to integrate or some 

221
00:13:42,661 --> 00:13:43,730
way or to reintegrate?
Yeah.

222
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,193
Oh Wow.
That's actually pretty easy 

223
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,830
responsibility.
I mean we've,

224
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:49,910
we've actually even seen it,
um,

225
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,060
the ability to,
um,

226
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,120
make a commitment and keep it,
um,

227
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,520
which,
which by the way ideologically shows up.

228
00:13:59,521 --> 00:14:01,880
Is that a duty or loyalty?
But those are both ideologies.

229
00:14:01,881 --> 00:14:02,180
The,
the,

230
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,100
the deeper sense is that ability,
um,

231
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,620
responsibility both at the individual 
and the group level,

232
00:14:08,621 --> 00:14:09,454
the ability to actually really make a 
personal sacrifice on the part of the 

233
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,860
group.
That's actually a deeply red value.

234
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,243
Um,
and I don't mean that by the way as 

235
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,220
politically ideological,
uh,

236
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,530
certainly there are people who,
um,

237
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,900
are currently part of blue who feel that
deeply.

238
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,210
What I'm saying is that,
that that shows up much,

239
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:36,730
much more intensely in red.
And when you're feeling it in blue,

240
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:38,320
you're actually feeling a red value and 
that's good.

241
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,540
Mixing them is crucial.
Um,

242
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,980
cause that's very Jordan Peterson asks 
to w how would you,

243
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,843
how would you define Jordan Peterson or 
do you think the fact that the issue is 

244
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,100
that he is,
is not within one of those

245
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,960
two camps?
I think that's the point.

246
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:58,280
I think that he grasps directly the fact
that human beings can only actually make

247
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:03,281
sense of the world by virtue of 
communication with other human beings.

248
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:07,750
And this is all about the notion of ad 
mixture had that one must have a mixture

249
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:11,210
of,
of what I mean he uses the mythic poetic

250
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,760
to make sense that the order order and 
chaos,

251
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,133
uh,
the way or the Taoist way is the al 

252
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:22,010
chemical admixture of order and chaos.
And that's it.

253
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:26,480
Like that's how you do it.
And so if you bias towards orderliness,

254
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:27,663
uh,
you find yourself in a rigid 

255
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,170
non-adaptive,
uh,

256
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,550
noncreative not exploratory framework,
um,

257
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,710
which will die because the world changes
if you buy us towards chaos,

258
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:40,990
um,
you,

259
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,680
you eat your young and evaporate.
Um,

260
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,290
which also ties for obvious reasons,
uh,

261
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,133
and the key is to actually be enabled 
these things to be in relationship with 

262
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:51,290
each other.
And vital healthy relationship with each

263
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,750
other and I think that's the,
in some sense,

264
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,593
the essence of what he's focusing on and
in sort of the core of what he's asking 

265
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,660
about it

266
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,000
in his heart for the broadcast media to 
get a handle on because the depth of his

267
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:05,570
thought means he doesn't fit easily into
any of their categories.

268
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,183
The clash with Kathy Newman was his 
breakthrough moment where the new world 

269
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,463
met the old,
to give the context from Kathy Newman 

270
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:14,714
side,
she has to do dozens of interviews each 

271
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,480
month.
Peterson is hard to get a grip on and he

272
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:24,650
sure as hell looks controversial.
She's also focused on getting soundbites

273
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,290
for a five minute cut down of the 
interview for TV.

274
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,930
Not a long conversation for online.

275
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,310
The interview was ridiculous.
It was a ridiculous interview.

276
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:34,144
I mean,
I listened to it or watched it several 

277
00:16:35,531 --> 00:16:36,191
times.
I was like,

278
00:16:36,191 --> 00:16:37,024
this is so strange.
It's like her determination to turn it 

279
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:41,014
into a conflict too.
It's one of the issues that I have with 

280
00:16:43,631 --> 00:16:44,800
television shows.
Yeah.

281
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:45,723
Because they have a very limited amount 
of time and they're trying to make 

282
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,540
things as salacious as possible.
They want to have these soundbites,

283
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,633
these clickbait soundbites,
and she just went into it incredibly 

284
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:57,394
confrontational.
Not Trying to find your actual 

285
00:16:58,871 --> 00:16:59,704
perspective,
but trying to force you to defend a non 

286
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,640
nonrealistic.
Yeah.

287
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,690
Perspective.
Yes.

288
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:05,524
While I was at,
I was the hypothetical villain of her 

289
00:17:07,631 --> 00:17:09,430
imagination essentially.
No.

290
00:17:09,431 --> 00:17:14,050
This is also why Youtube is going to 
kill tv because television,

291
00:17:14,051 --> 00:17:14,884
by its nature,
all of these narrow broadcast 

292
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,210
technologies,
they re they rely on forcing the story.

293
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,490
Right,
because it has to happen now.

294
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:28,300
It has to happen like often in five 
minutes because they only broadcast five

295
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:29,134
minutes of that interview.
They did put the whole thing up on 

296
00:17:31,631 --> 00:17:32,860
youtube.
To their credit.

297
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,713
Yeah,
it,

298
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,180
it,
it hasn't ceased to amaze me yet.

299
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:40,930
I think that they thought that the 
interview went fine

300
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,443
after the interview.
Channel Four news found themselves at 

301
00:17:44,551 --> 00:17:48,660
the center of an online storm,
which included some nasty,

302
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,520
a misogynistic

303
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,353
attacks.

304
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,220
It's understandable that they just 
wanted it to go away,

305
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,193
but online is forever and as the center 
of gravity continues to shift away from 

306
00:18:03,401 --> 00:18:05,860
traditional media,
this interview is,

307
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:06,723
I would argue,
a slow motion and continuing car crash 

308
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,570
for Channel Four's credibility.
So why did it happen?

309
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,660
Partly the limitations of the medium of 
TV,

310
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,913
but also because of the institutional 
political blindness of the mainstream 

311
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,023
media.
I've always considered myself of the 

312
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:24,874
liberal left,
but especially since the election of 

313
00:18:26,651 --> 00:18:27,484
trump,
I've been trying to understand what 

314
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:29,584
happened and I'm convinced that the 
polarization we're seeing is mainly 

315
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:36,430
driven by the shadow side of liberalism 
in particular,

316
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,560
where supposedly inclusive social 
justice liberalism stops being inclusive

317
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:45,490
and secretly judges and despises people 
that don't think the same way.

318
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:50,500
The rebellion of trump and brexit was a 
direct response.

319
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,120
Yeah.

320
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,970
As Eerie Harris argues in this article 
in Colette,

321
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,283
the new gatekeepers of the media have 
become a new bourgeoisie in forcing a 

322
00:18:59,651 --> 00:19:00,484
rigid etiquette and using the rights of 
the oppressed as an excuse to put 

323
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:07,930
forward a vision of the kind of society 
they personally want to live in.

324
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,793
On the surface level,
it's about how a narrow social justice 

325
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,373
worldview embodied by Kathy Newman in 
the interview became the new status quo 

326
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,423
and how this institutional bias of much 
of the mainstream media means it can't 

327
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:28,830
see or understand the forces that are 
challenging this new consensus.

328
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,180
The counterculture used to be on the 
left,

329
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,340
but once it one the culture war,
it left space for a new counter culture,

330
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,600
the biggest manifestation is the red 
pill phenomena,

331
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,033
which the mainstream media mistakenly 
assumes is the same thing as the alt 

332
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:48,654
right.

333
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:53,080
I was surprised to discover the overlap 
between,

334
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:58,150
um,
what I'm into a particularly like,

335
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,083
um,
Greek philosophy and stoicism and the 

336
00:20:03,341 --> 00:20:05,710
old right.
Who I'd always thought of,

337
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,880
you know,
if I come across from the tour,

338
00:20:06,881 --> 00:20:09,190
I thought that was kind of,
um,

339
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,130
squibb allied boogie man,
you know,

340
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,000
uh,
completely unpalatable like extremists,

341
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,150
uh,
in their,

342
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:20,230
in their basements.
And then to discover that,

343
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,790
um,
you know,

344
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:22,624
a lot of them were a lot of people in 
stoicism and also really into the old 

345
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:31,120
right.
Made me wonder what was going on and why

346
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,390
people like me.
We're getting radicalized,

347
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,470
kind of drawn into it.
You're explaining what stoicism is for

348
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,270
is basically an ancient Greek 
philosophy,

349
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,360
which,
um,

350
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,330
with became very popular in the Roman,
uh,

351
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,000
uh,
you know,

352
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,230
we did the emperor marcus or radius was 
a stoic for example.

353
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,070
And it's in some ways like a Western 
form of Buddhism.

354
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,173
It's like a therapy for the emotions.
It teaches you to take responsibility 

355
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:04,420
for your thoughts,
to take a nearby,

356
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:05,254
to take some control of your emotions.
So in some ways it's putting forward a 

357
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:14,671
model of a strength and integrity and 
kind of resilience.

358
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,060
Uh,
I made adversity and rapid change.

359
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:23,590
So for that reason it's become very 
popular in the last 10 years.

360
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,040
I think this is also why from my 
perspective,

361
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:27,874
at least someone like Jordan Peterson is
often looked from the outside as being 

362
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,090
aligned with the alt right because he 
has a similar message.

363
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:36,490
But it's,
there are crucial differences I think,

364
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:39,580
between what we would consider.
I mean,

365
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:43,030
certainly white nationalism would be an 
essential part of the outright,

366
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,710
I would say,
of any useful definition.

367
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,040
And that's certainly not characteristic 
of,

368
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,600
of Jordan Peterson from my experience,

369
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,780
there's a crucial difference at least 
between stoicism and your right.

370
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,063
Uh,
even though a lot of old writers into 

371
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:02,130
stoicism ending that stoicism and maybe 
Jordan Peterson as well.

372
00:22:02,131 --> 00:22:03,840
I don't,
I'm not an expert on him.

373
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,140
Talk about the way to gain strength and 
maturity and power is internal.

374
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,180
It's to take responsibility for your own
thoughts and feelings.

375
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,553
Whilst I think people,
sometimes men white look for that sense 

376
00:22:20,011 --> 00:22:25,011
of power and control externally by 
suppressing or,

377
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,793
or,
or segregating anyone who they feel 

378
00:22:29,251 --> 00:22:30,084
threatened by,
whether that's other colors or other 

379
00:22:32,731 --> 00:22:34,120
sexualities or,
or,

380
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,130
or,
or gender.

381
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:39,360
So there's a crucial difference there.
One is about kind of inner integrity,

382
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,160
uh,
and,

383
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,520
and,
and it just kind of,

384
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,290
um,
being strong within yourself.

385
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,124
And the other is about trying to take 
control through the kind of exterior 

386
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,350
borders and fences,
if you see what I mean.

387
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,493
Every public appearance that I've made 
that's related to the sort of topics 

388
00:22:53,321 --> 00:22:55,630
that we're discussing is overwhelmingly,
man,

389
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,540
it's like,
it's like 85 to 90%.

390
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,801
And so I thought,
wow,

391
00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:01,660
that's weird.
Like what the hell's going on here.

392
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:04,180
Exactly.
And then the other thing I've noticed is

393
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:07,960
that I've been talking a lot to the 
crowds that I'd be talking to,

394
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,910
not about rights,
but about responsibility,

395
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:10,983
right?
Because he can't have the bloody 

396
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:13,060
converse.
What are you doing?

397
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:13,923
You can't have the conversation about 
rights without the conversation about 

398
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:20,740
responsibility because your rights are 
my responsibility.

399
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,600
That's what they are technically.
So you just can't have only half of that

400
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:27,970
discussion and we're only having half 
that discussion.

401
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,201
And the question is,
well,

402
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:33,520
what the hell are you leaving out if you
only have that half of the discussion?

403
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,250
And the answer is what?
You're leaving out responsibility.

404
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,740
And then the question is,
well what are you leaving out?

405
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:41,590
If you're leaving out responsibility?
And the answer might be,

406
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,690
well maybe you're leaving out the 
meaning of life.

407
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:49,220
That's what looks like to me.
It's like here you are suffering away.

408
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,740
What makes it worthwhile,
right?

409
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,850
You know you're completely,
oh,

410
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:58,400
you're completely,
you have no idea what you're you.

411
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:03,260
It's almost impossible to describe how 
bad an idea that is.

412
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,970
Responsibility.
That's what gives life meaning.

413
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:12,170
It's like lift a load,
then you can tolerate yourself.

414
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:13,910
Right?
Cause look at your useless,

415
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,460
easily hurt,
easily killed.

416
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:20,240
Why should you have any self respect?
That's the story of the fall.

417
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,670
Pick something up and carry it.
Pick,

418
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:24,410
make it heavy enough so that you can 
think,

419
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,840
yeah,
well useless as I am.

420
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:29,210
At least I could move that from there to
there.

421
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:33,170
Well what's really cool about that is 
that when I talked to these crowds about

422
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,004
this,
the man's eyes light up and that's very 

423
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,183
like I've seen that phenomena because 
I've been talking about this 

424
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:41,570
mythological material for a long time 
and I can see when I'm watching crowds,

425
00:24:41,571 --> 00:24:43,700
people,
you know their eyebrows lift,

426
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:47,120
their eyes light up because I've put 
something together for them,

427
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,980
not sweat,
mythological stories do.

428
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,930
So I'm not taking responsibility for 
that.

429
00:24:50,931 --> 00:24:53,150
That's what the story is due.
So I say this story,

430
00:24:53,151 --> 00:24:54,110
when people go click,
click,

431
00:24:54,111 --> 00:24:55,880
click,
you know when their eyes light up.

432
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,240
But this responsibility thing,
that's a whole new order of this is that

433
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,600
young men are so hungry for that.
It is unbelievable.

434
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,490
It just blows me away.
It's like,

435
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:06,410
really?
That's what's,

436
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,573
that's the counterculture.
Grow the hell up and do something 

437
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:12,380
useful.
Really.

438
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:13,220
I could do that.
Oh,

439
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,880
I'm so excited by that idea.
No one ever mentioned that before.

440
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,110
It's like rights,
rights,

441
00:25:18,111 --> 00:25:19,040
rights,
rights,

442
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,200
Jesus.
It's,

443
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,070
it's,
it's appalling.

444
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,060
It's,
it's,

445
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,893
and,
and I feel that that's deeply felt by 

446
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:27,650
the people who are,
who are coming out to,

447
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,230
to listen to these sorts of things,
to there.

448
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,750
They've had enough of that.
So,

449
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:33,643
and they better have because it's a 
nonproductive motive being 

450
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,550
responsibility.
Man.

451
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:38,723
Peterson is part of the counterculture 
that he describes himself as a classic 

452
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:46,560
liberal and yet he's frequently 
described as right wing by the media.

453
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,510
This is not limited to Peterson.
James Damore is infamous.

454
00:25:51,511 --> 00:25:56,511
Google memo was described everywhere.
There's an anti diversity screed despite

455
00:25:56,761 --> 00:25:57,594
him specifically stating he wanted to 
encourage more diversity in the 

456
00:26:00,481 --> 00:26:01,314
workplace.
Many believe that the channel four 

457
00:26:10,261 --> 00:26:12,990
interview,
it was a significant moment and exposing

458
00:26:12,991 --> 00:26:17,310
this mindset as dogmatic,
reactionary and fixed.

459
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,690
So during the interview we see an 
example of a,

460
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,460
um,
uh,

461
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,293
a delusional framework that is what 
appears to be largely incapable of 

462
00:26:26,691 --> 00:26:29,260
perceiving,
reacting to reality in real time.

463
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,600
But much more interesting is what 
happened afterwards,

464
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,753
which was the sort of the self healing 
and policing mechanism of the larger 

465
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,030
social consensus of how,
when,

466
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:41,963
how the Blue Church
reactively goes about maintaining the 

467
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:50,290
integrity of its frame.
Um,

468
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,470
and so what ended up happening was there
was a break in the frame,

469
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:54,630
there was a glitch in the matrix.
The,

470
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:58,830
uh,
mechanisms of the Blue Church reacted to

471
00:26:58,831 --> 00:26:59,664
endeavor,
to control the frame and to convert it 

472
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:03,150
into a way of sense of,
of,

473
00:27:03,151 --> 00:27:05,310
uh,
making sense of the,

474
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,270
what occurred that still maintained the 
integrity of its frame.

475
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,970
And you can do,
you mean when they tried to characterize

476
00:27:10,971 --> 00:27:11,804
it as a sort of abusive trolls and 
you'll write hero and all of that is 

477
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:19,730
actually exactly the sort of a,
to use a military language.

478
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,520
It was a fall back position that was a 
reactive,

479
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,550
almost instinctual and not all,
most in fact precisely.

480
00:27:25,551 --> 00:27:27,420
Instinction was that pure habit.
Uh,

481
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:29,530
there was no,
uh,

482
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:32,790
thoughtfulness or even,
um,

483
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,380
strategic action.
There it was.

484
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,513
If if x,
then y and in this case why is here's a 

485
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,453
set of things that one does to 
reestablish the dominant frame and now 

486
00:27:46,141 --> 00:27:47,750
we're now we're two levels deep.
You know,

487
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,420
the first level was a sort of self 
evident disaster,

488
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,433
but then the second level was also a 
relatively self avid disaster and there 

489
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,110
isn't really a third level,
um,

490
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,973
in this approach.
So it ends up happening and this is 

491
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,223
again,
we can kind of just think about this 

492
00:28:02,921 --> 00:28:06,040
from ordinary psychology.
Um,

493
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,000
this is how delusions fall apart because
try as we might,

494
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:14,600
our desire to interpret reality to me,
but we want it to mean at the end of the

495
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,500
day will always be checked against what 
reality actually is.

496
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,910
Maybe some time,
you know,

497
00:28:20,911 --> 00:28:21,820
we're pretty good at,
at,

498
00:28:21,821 --> 00:28:23,670
at,
at making things up in pretending,

499
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,820
but eventually reality is reality.

500
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,780
This isn't to say that Peterson is not 
controversial.

501
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,483
He's saying things that challenge the 
most deeply held assumptions of the new 

502
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:36,110
establishment narrative.

503
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,223
I guess the other reason that people are
on my case to some degree is because I 

504
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:44,340
have made a strong case,
which I think is fully documented by the

505
00:28:44,341 --> 00:28:47,040
scientific literature,
that there are intrinsic differences say

506
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:49,470
between men and women.
And I think the evidence on that,

507
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,543
this is the thing that staggered me,
is that no serious scientists have 

508
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:55,314
debated that for like four decades.
It's that argument was done by the time 

509
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:03,840
I went to graduate school.
Everyone knew that human beings,

510
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:04,674
we're not a blank slate.
That biological forces parameterize the 

511
00:29:09,421 --> 00:29:12,840
way that we thought and felt and acted 
in and,

512
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,733
and valued.
Everyone knew that the fact that this 

513
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:18,120
has become somehow debatable again is 
just,

514
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,150
especially because it's being done by 
legislative Fiat,

515
00:29:21,151 --> 00:29:21,990
they're forcing it

516
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,653
pause.
Peterson's argument based on years of 

517
00:29:25,671 --> 00:29:29,630
psychological research is that much of 
the political conflicts,

518
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,793
uh,
due to try to integrate the different 

519
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,910
political temperaments of men and women.

520
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,563
We were talking about the relatively,
the relative evolutionary roles of men 

521
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:41,710
and women.
And this is speculative obviously.

522
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,903
And,
and because our research did indicate 

523
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:47,710
it's tentative research so far that that
the,

524
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,603
the,
the SGS sjw sort of equality above all 

525
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:55,210
else philosophy is more prevalent among 
women.

526
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,413
It's predicted by the personality 
factors that are more common among 

527
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:01,054
women.
So agreeableness and high negative 

528
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:05,020
emotion,
primarily agreeableness.

529
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:08,230
But in addition it's also predicted by 
being female.

530
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,440
And so I've been thinking about that a 
lot because,

531
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:12,843
well men are bailing out of the 
humanities like mad and pretty much out 

532
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:16,354
of the universities except for stem,
the women are moving in like mad and 

533
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:22,060
they're also moving into the political 
sphere like mad.

534
00:30:22,061 --> 00:30:23,020
And this is new,
right?

535
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,910
We've never had this happen before and 
we do.

536
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,480
No,
no,

537
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,370
do not know what the significance of it 
is.

538
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,323
It's only 50 years old.
And so we were thinking about this and 

539
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,400
so I don't know what you think about 
this proposition,

540
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:35,100
but imagine that,
that,

541
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:35,963
that historically speaking,
it's something like women were 

542
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:43,180
responsible for distribution and men 
were responsible for production.

543
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,820
Something like that.
And maybe,

544
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,673
and maybe that's only the case really in
the tight confines of the immediate 

545
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:50,494
family,
but that doesn't matter because that's 

546
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:53,950
most of the evolutionary landscape for 
human beings anyways.

547
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,460
What the women does it did was make sure
that everybody got enough.

548
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,343
Okay.
And that seems to me to be one of the 

549
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:04,600
things that's driving,
at least in part the sjw demand for,

550
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,370
for equity and equality.
It's like,

551
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,160
let's make sure everybody has enough.
It's like,

552
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,150
well look,
fair enough.

553
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:10,801
You know,
I mean you,

554
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:12,550
you can't,
you can't argue with that.

555
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,593
But there's,
there's an antipathy between that and 

556
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:19,240
the reality of differential 
productivity.

557
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,160
You know,
because people really do differ in their

558
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:21,994
productivity.
I think that the sjw phenomena is 

559
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,174
different and I think it is associated 
at least in part with the rise of women 

560
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:28,804
to political power and,
and we don't know what women are like 

561
00:31:32,621 --> 00:31:35,410
when they have political power because 
they've never had it.

562
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,530
I mean there's been queens obviously and
that sort of thing.

563
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:39,364
Just being female authority figures and 
females have wielded far more power 

564
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,560
historically than feminists generally 
like to admit.

565
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,170
But this is a different thing and we 
don't know what,

566
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:50,320
what I've truly female political 
philosophy would be like,

567
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,423
but it might be,
especially if it's not being well 

568
00:31:53,471 --> 00:31:55,930
examined and it isn't very sophisticated
conceptually,

569
00:31:55,931 --> 00:31:57,130
it could easily be,
well,

570
00:31:57,131 --> 00:31:59,650
let's makes sure things are distributed 
equally well.

571
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,100
Yeah,
but sorry,

572
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:07,610
fly.
One of the Peterson's main influences is

573
00:32:08,941 --> 00:32:09,774
the psychologist Carl Young human 
psychology was built around the concept 

574
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:16,560
of the shadow,
all the things about ourselves.

575
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:20,340
We don't want to accept our anger,
negativity,

576
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,623
unconscious judgments,
and how we need to integrate all those 

577
00:32:24,511 --> 00:32:29,280
disowned parts to grow.
I'm convinced that's what's happening on

578
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:33,510
a vast cultural level since leaving 
channel four news.

579
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,373
I've retrained as a counselor and 
started leading personal growth 

580
00:32:37,201 --> 00:32:38,034
workshops for men on thought a lot about
how these unconscious gender dynamics 

581
00:32:42,201 --> 00:32:43,034
are playing out in the culture.
One of the central concepts is Yum's 

582
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:47,924
idea of animus anima possession,
or we each have both an inner masculine 

583
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:57,320
and feminine essence in a man.
When he's unconsciously possessed by his

584
00:32:57,321 --> 00:32:58,790
feminine side,
his Anima,

585
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:02,090
he becomes withdrawn,
moody and reactive.

586
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,300
And when a woman is possessed by her 
male side,

587
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,660
the animus,
she becomes aggressive and dominating.

588
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:14,000
And how many women are pushed into that 
by the nature of the modern workplace.

589
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,240
The Kathy Newman I know is warm,
compassionate,

590
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,460
uh,
successful and talented journalist.

591
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,713
None of this is criticism of her,
just the role she was playing in the 

592
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:24,404
interview.

593
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,263
I would say technically,
and this is might be interesting for 

594
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:29,350
people who were interested in union 
psychology.

595
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,550
If you want to understand what Carl Jung
meant by animus possession,

596
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,543
which is a very difficult concept then 
that that interview was a textbook case 

597
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,520
of having a discussion with someone who 
is animus,

598
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:43,354
possessed life has been moving forward 
for three and a half billion years and 

599
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,340
it moves forward in these pattern 
matters,

600
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:53,110
like the dominance hierarchy for 
example.

601
00:33:53,111 --> 00:33:55,810
So that's that.
Let's call that the masculine archetype.

602
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,450
It's part of the masculine archetype.
In fact,

603
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:03,490
youngest proclamation was that the 
female representation of the mail.

604
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:08,380
So that's the animus is the dominance 
hierarchy.

605
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:11,940
It's the patriarchy.
So that's the,

606
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:12,843
that's the unconscious archetype,
which I think is extremely interesting 

607
00:34:15,641 --> 00:34:16,474
given what's happened,
say in the women's movement because 

608
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:18,994
that's what's projected onto men and,
and it can be projected in a very 

609
00:34:23,471 --> 00:34:24,760
negative way.
It doesn't have to be,

610
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:29,110
but it can be.
And so an animus possessed woman treat a

611
00:34:29,111 --> 00:34:32,440
man as if he's the manifestation of the 
tyrannical patriarchy.

612
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,140
He's a group.
He's that group of men.

613
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:37,260
Yeah,
the group of bad band.

614
00:34:37,261 --> 00:34:41,050
Now actually you watch the Jordan 
Peterson Kathy Newman interview.

615
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,250
What did he,
what did he think?

616
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:43,084
Thank

617
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:47,030
who I,
my whole body contracted and I,

618
00:34:47,031 --> 00:34:52,031
I felt so sad for womanhood.
I felt disappointed and um,

619
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:02,780
I could see how the shadow part of 
womanhood was acting out.

620
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:09,200
I could see how the collective rage was 
acting through Kathy Newman.

621
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,573
And this is what happens is that when 
that's unknown and it's projected 

622
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:21,060
blindly on to whatever stick,
whatever it sticks.

623
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,373
And it was very clear that she already 
had an agenda and she already had a 

624
00:35:25,231 --> 00:35:28,530
projection that she was just looking to 
stay.

625
00:35:28,531 --> 00:35:29,364
She was,
she was just looking to have that 

626
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:34,050
confirmed.
So I felt on behalf of women,

627
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:39,410
I felt sad and disappointed because we 
to have intelligent conversations.

628
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,630
And I also want to say that this isn't,
even though the,

629
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,900
the specific example is the Kathy Newman
Jordan an interview.

630
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,080
It's not specific to,
to Kathy Newman.

631
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:50,943
I think the fact that that interview has
resonated with so many people that has 

632
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:54,754
been so popular shows that actually 
something archetype was going on in 

633
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:00,700
that,
in that interaction.

634
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:01,983
And I think as well,
why it's gone viral is a lot of people 

635
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,130
watching it recognize those dynamics.
They're like,

636
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,810
I've been in conversations like that.
Yeah.

637
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:11,823
I've been in this conversation when 
nothing I say works when nothing I say 

638
00:36:14,861 --> 00:36:15,730
he gets through.
Yeah.

639
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:18,160
Um,
so there's something sort of fundamental

640
00:36:18,161 --> 00:36:21,430
about about the masculine and feminine 
dynamic that is going on in there.

641
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,653
What do you think that is?

642
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,460
I think Jordan Peterson,
he's every man.

643
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,830
Kathy Newman,
she's every woman.

644
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,143
I can tap into that rage like this.
I know it in myself and women that say 

645
00:36:33,081 --> 00:36:33,914
they don't,
they just denying it because it is in 

646
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:37,244
the collective.
So in that sense it just highlighted 

647
00:36:39,771 --> 00:36:40,700
what,
what's there.

648
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,880
It's wonderful because here we really 
get to look at why is this so important?

649
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:48,883
Why is it so important to listen to,
to a thinker like Jordan Peterson and 

650
00:36:54,141 --> 00:36:57,200
take it seriously and say,
what can we do with it?

651
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,560
It's just so obvious that it's needed 
because if this is where we are,

652
00:37:02,841 --> 00:37:05,150
if this is where society and cultures 
is,

653
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,133
if this is the ability to have an 
intelligent conversations conversation 

654
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,543
than we are in trouble,
I really feel that there is this 

655
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,753
collective,
subconscious rage that is just boiling 

656
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:22,340
in women and it's coming up in so many 
ways.

657
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,100
We see,
we see in the media and,

658
00:37:24,101 --> 00:37:29,101
and,
and what's going on is this unknown rage

659
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,760
that comes up in,
in many different ways.

660
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:36,500
Um,
and on one hand it needs to come out.

661
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,950
We need to clear it.
It needs to be expressed.

662
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:43,040
It needs to be acknowledged.
On the other hand,

663
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:44,323
it's not enough.
This is only like this is breaking the 

664
00:37:47,211 --> 00:37:51,620
ice so that the next step of evolution 
can,

665
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,830
you know,
consciousness can start coming through.

666
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,873
And that's what I'm lacking in women.
It's really to take responsibility for 

667
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:05,000
what we do as women in our manipulation,
in our seduction,

668
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,340
in our control.
And,

669
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,233
and it's so easy for women to say,
but that's just because we're angry and 

670
00:38:12,231 --> 00:38:14,960
mandate this and patriarchy,
but it's,

671
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:15,794
um,
it's such a lack of responsibility and 

672
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,150
this women really need to know.

673
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,393
I mean that's the kind of shadow work is
the acceptance that we all have shadows 

674
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,020
that men certainly have a shadow.
There was a shadow around masculinity,

675
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,780
but there's also a shadow around 
femininity.

676
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,003
And while part of the cultural now is 
toxic masculinity and everyone knows 

677
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:40,000
what you mean by toxic toxic 
masculinity.

678
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,250
If you talk about toxic femininity,
everyone still knows what you mean,

679
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,180
but you can't have that conversation.
Yeah.

680
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,700
Which is,
it's,

681
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,534
it's interesting what is allowed to be 
said and what is not allowed to be said 

682
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,470
at the moment.
And that,

683
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:58,830
that I think is,
is very dangerous that certain topics,

684
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:03,310
certain conversations or off or off 
limits.

685
00:39:03,311 --> 00:39:03,650
Yeah.

686
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:06,710
And this is where we see where,
where we see the victim,

687
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:07,544
persecutor dynamics activates it because
women become the become the victims and 

688
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:15,800
we make ourselves the victims and we 
persecute men.

689
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,290
But in that aggression,
in that rage,

690
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,680
and when we are the victims,
we are in perfect control.

691
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:27,100
We become the persecutors because we say
it's all about blame.

692
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:31,370
Did this and men need to take 
responsibility.

693
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,100
But in that we've become the 
persecutors.

694
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:34,320
Yeah.

695
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,320
And it's also very difficult as well 
because one imagines that that combative

696
00:39:40,051 --> 00:39:42,870
attitude is something that has served 
her well in the past.

697
00:39:42,871 --> 00:39:46,650
And it's something that she's maybe felt
forced into because of the nature of the

698
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:50,400
society that he's operating it.
So it's a kind of catch 22 situation for

699
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,473
the many successful women because they 
feel that they're pushed to be more 

700
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:54,924
masculine.
Yeah.

701
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,153
And then when they're more masculine,
they get judged for being more 

702
00:39:59,821 --> 00:40:00,654
masculine.

703
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,700
It's,
it's very sad.

704
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:03,671
And,
and,

705
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:05,760
and I can see that dynamics being played
out.

706
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:06,683
Absolutely.
But I think the only thing we can do is 

707
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:11,580
to take responsibility and say,
okay,

708
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,773
I'm doing that.
Do I really want to compromise my 

709
00:40:15,061 --> 00:40:18,720
femininity?
Do I want to compromise my integrity?

710
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:24,150
Do I want to compromise my gender and 
play that or is there another way that I

711
00:40:24,151 --> 00:40:26,730
can be powerful without being 
aggressive,

712
00:40:26,731 --> 00:40:30,930
without playing a power game,
but resting in my natural power,

713
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,153
resting in my natural dignity,
resting in that deep rootedness that we 

714
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:36,894
both have in our agendas that when we 
are at peace with it and when we 

715
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:45,730
acknowledge it in ourselves,
it's that as a natural thing,

716
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,180
and this is the thing,
I don't want to make this personal about

717
00:40:48,181 --> 00:40:49,014
Katherine Newman because it's,
it's in that potential is in every 

718
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:52,374
woman,
but it's because we are persecuting our 

719
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,523
own femininity.
What's being played out that we are 

720
00:40:57,571 --> 00:40:58,404
doing it to ourselves because we don't 
trust that it's good enough to be a 

721
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:01,824
woman.
We don't trust that we can have 

722
00:41:02,821 --> 00:41:06,480
conversations that come from the felt 
embodied perspective.

723
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:10,320
We don't trust that we're connected to 
truth because these,

724
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:11,363
these masculine ways have been,
have been very strong and women have 

725
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:17,040
been denying their own power.

726
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:20,280
In my work over many years of working 
with this,

727
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:25,610
I find that very few women grew up in 
households which really loved,

728
00:41:27,241 --> 00:41:29,460
admired,
respected on or heard,

729
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:34,670
cherished the feminine.
And so there is for so many of the women

730
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:38,180
who've grown up in the,
I dunno,

731
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:40,550
the last hundred years that say,
um,

732
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,700
uh,
kind of devaluation of the feminine that

733
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:47,300
gets taken on and of course,
and as well as abuse,

734
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,980
aggression,
all sorts of things.

735
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,280
So very many women out of an intelligent
strategy to survive,

736
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:59,630
develop their masculine side as a 
defense against that devaluation for the

737
00:41:59,631 --> 00:42:00,464
feminine.
And over time they become very 

738
00:42:01,851 --> 00:42:02,684
identified with that mask on side.
The male equivalent is anima possession 

739
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,083
in Anima possession.
It's the loss of relaxed confidence in 

740
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:13,634
the groundedness in the masculine and is
overwhelmed by his own inner feminine 

741
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:21,680
side.
And it creates a passive withdrawn,

742
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:24,290
moody,
Bitchy,

743
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:29,630
complaining,
not showing up kind of guy,

744
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:33,830
which I think is really so much what 
feminists are angry about.

745
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:37,640
The don't see them as really angry about
the masculine per se,

746
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:41,250
but the way that males behave.
And you know,

747
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,103
I have quite a lot of compassion for 
that because for myself and most men 

748
00:42:45,681 --> 00:42:46,514
that I know,
we weren't really shown how to be as 

749
00:42:48,891 --> 00:42:51,860
men.
We didn't really get initiated into it.

750
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:52,694
And so,
and then the strong thing comes from 

751
00:42:54,681 --> 00:42:58,880
feminism and we feel like it's,
it's maleness that's wrong.

752
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,270
It's not,
it's not maleness that's wrong.

753
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,800
And I don't even think feminists,
feminists hate the masculine.

754
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:08,203
It's like what the call is really for 
men is to develop their masculine 

755
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,150
strength,
presence,

756
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,210
courage,
be relaxed and confident,

757
00:43:17,211 --> 00:43:22,211
be protective and be strong.
And under this kind of assault,

758
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:25,340
which has come from a lot of animals,
possessed women,

759
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:26,303
a lot of men have retreated.
And I think gone into feeling guilty 

760
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:34,361
about being men and have become passive 
indecisive.

761
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,653
Um,
and in that way a kind of feminized man 

762
00:43:39,801 --> 00:43:40,790
has emerged.

763
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:42,863
Yeah.

764
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:45,983
Lacy's follow eight pieces and store 
recognize his analysis goes all the way 

765
00:43:49,571 --> 00:43:50,404
down to the bedrock,
to the archetypal structures of 

766
00:43:53,051 --> 00:43:54,250
consciousness itself.

767
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,570
The thing that I really see happening,
and you can tell me what you think about

768
00:43:57,571 --> 00:44:01,890
this in Norman's book consciousness,
which is masculine,

769
00:44:01,891 --> 00:44:04,230
symbolically masculine for a variety of 
reasons,

770
00:44:04,231 --> 00:44:05,064
is,
is viewed as rising up against the 

771
00:44:08,431 --> 00:44:12,180
countervailing force of tragedy from an 
underlying co feminine,

772
00:44:12,181 --> 00:44:14,370
Symbolically Feminine unconsciousness,
right?

773
00:44:14,371 --> 00:44:17,550
And it's something that can always be 
pulled back into that unconsciousness.

774
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,533
That would be the microcosm of that 
would be the Friday and eatable mother 

775
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:22,853
familial dynamic where the mother was so
over protective and all encompassing 

776
00:44:27,421 --> 00:44:29,790
that she interferes with the development
of the competence,

777
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:30,683
not only of her sons,
but over daughters of her children in 

778
00:44:32,611 --> 00:44:33,444
general.
And it seems to me that that's the 

779
00:44:35,071 --> 00:44:35,904
dynamic that's being played out in our 
society right now is that there's this 

780
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:39,923
and it's,
it's related in some way that I don't 

781
00:44:41,071 --> 00:44:41,904
understand to this,
to this insistence that all forms of 

782
00:44:44,221 --> 00:44:47,010
masculine and authority or nothing by 
tyrannical power.

783
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:47,843
So the symbolic representation is 
tyrannical father with no appreciation 

784
00:44:53,281 --> 00:44:54,114
for the benevolent father and benevolent
mother with no appreciation whatsoever 

785
00:44:58,021 --> 00:44:59,700
for the tyrannical mother.
Right.

786
00:44:59,701 --> 00:45:03,900
And that's that cause I thought of 
videology is as fragmentary mythologies.

787
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:07,020
That's where they get their archetype in
psychological power,

788
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,360
right?
And so in a balanced representation,

789
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:13,620
you have the terrible mother and the 
great mother as as noise and laid out so

790
00:45:13,621 --> 00:45:16,750
nicely and you have the terrible father 
in the great father.

791
00:45:16,751 --> 00:45:19,800
So that's the fact that culture mangles 
you have to death well.

792
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:21,870
It's also promoting you and developing 
you.

793
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:22,863
You have to see that as balanced.
And then you have the heroic and 

794
00:45:24,811 --> 00:45:28,140
adversarial individual.
But in the postmodern world,

795
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:29,123
and this seems to be something that's 
increasingly seeping out into the 

796
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:32,634
culture at large,
you have nothing but the tyrannical 

797
00:45:34,381 --> 00:45:35,214
father.
Nothing but the destructive force of 

798
00:45:37,351 --> 00:45:40,650
masculine consciousness and nothing but 
the benevolent,

799
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,480
benevolent,
great mother.

800
00:45:42,481 --> 00:45:44,400
And it's a,
it's an appalling ideology.

801
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:47,430
And it seems to me that it's sucking the
vitality,

802
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,413
which,
which is exactly what you would expect 

803
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:50,274
symbolically.
It's sucking the vitality of our 

804
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:52,404
culture.
You see that with the increasing 

805
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,970
demolition of,
of young men,

806
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:59,670
um,
and not only young men in terms of their

807
00:45:59,671 --> 00:46:02,430
academic performance,
which like they're falling way behind in

808
00:46:02,431 --> 00:46:05,910
elementary school way behind in junior 
high and bailing out of the universities

809
00:46:05,911 --> 00:46:07,680
like mad.
And so,

810
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:08,680
and I,

811
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,460
well the public school education has 
become completely permeated by this kind

812
00:46:12,461 --> 00:46:14,630
of anti male propaganda.
I mean,

813
00:46:14,631 --> 00:46:17,380
and to me public schools I just a form 
of imprisonment,

814
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:18,243
you know,
right now they are particularly 

815
00:46:19,061 --> 00:46:22,610
destructive to young men who have a lot 
of physical energy right now.

816
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,400
You know,
I identify as transgender,

817
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:25,690
Gay Mike Myself,
right?

818
00:46:25,691 --> 00:46:26,524
But I do not,
I do not require the entire world to 

819
00:46:29,981 --> 00:46:31,320
alter itself okay.
To,

820
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:36,321
to fit my particular in the self image.
I do believe in the power of hormones.

821
00:46:36,341 --> 00:46:40,780
I believe that men exist and women exist
and are biologically different.

822
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:44,360
I think that,
I think there is no cure for,

823
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,213
I'm the cultures ills right now except 
if men start standing up away and 

824
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:51,820
demanding that they be respected as men.

825
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,680
Here's the problem.
You know,

826
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:56,170
this is something my wife has pointed 
out to.

827
00:46:56,171 --> 00:46:56,741
She said,
well,

828
00:46:56,741 --> 00:46:58,570
men are going to have to stand up for 
themselves.

829
00:46:58,571 --> 00:47:02,680
But here's the problem.
I know how to stand up to a man who's,

830
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:03,933
who's,
uh,

831
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:04,863
unfairly trespassed against me.
And the reason I know that is because 

832
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:11,440
the parameters for my resistance are 
quite well defined,

833
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:14,050
which is we talk,
we argue,

834
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:16,870
we push,
and then it becomes physical,

835
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:17,921
right?
Like if,

836
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:21,010
if we move beyond the boundaries of 
civil discourse,

837
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:22,990
we know what the next step is.
Okay.

838
00:47:22,991 --> 00:47:26,130
That's forbidden in,
in discourse with women.

839
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:27,183
So I don't know,
like it seems to me that it isn't men 

840
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,750
that have to stand up and say enough of 
this,

841
00:47:31,751 --> 00:47:32,584
even though that is what they should do.
It seems to me that it's same women who 

842
00:47:35,681 --> 00:47:38,590
have to stand up against their crazy 
sisters and say,

843
00:47:38,591 --> 00:47:39,424
look,
enough of that enough man hating enough 

844
00:47:41,261 --> 00:47:44,920
pathology,
enough bringing disgrace on us as a,

845
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:46,030
as a gender.

846
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:50,020
But the problem there,
and then I'll start my little tirade,

847
00:47:50,021 --> 00:47:54,910
is that most of the women I know who are
sane are busy doing same things,

848
00:47:54,911 --> 00:47:55,680
right?
They're off.

849
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,400
They have their career,
they have their family,

850
00:47:57,401 --> 00:47:58,234
they're quite occupied and they don't 
seem to have the time or maybe even the 

851
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:04,600
interest to go after there.
They're crazy heartbeat sisters.

852
00:48:04,601 --> 00:48:07,090
And so I don't see any regulating force 
for that,

853
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:08,103
that terrible femininity.
And it seems to me to be invading the 

854
00:48:12,161 --> 00:48:17,140
culture and undermining the masculine 
power of the culture in a way that's,

855
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,060
I think fatal.
I really do believe that.

856
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,840
I too,
I too believe that these are,

857
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,960
this is symptomatic of the decline of 
Western culture and,

858
00:48:23,961 --> 00:48:24,460
and we,
and,

859
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:27,730
and it will just go down flat.
I don't think people realize that,

860
00:48:27,731 --> 00:48:31,270
you know,
masculinity is still exists in the world

861
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:33,970
as a code among jihadists.
Okay.

862
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,490
And when you have passionate 
masculinity,

863
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,400
okay.
Circling the borders,

864
00:48:38,401 --> 00:48:40,690
like the huns in the vandals during the 
Roman empire,

865
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:41,560
that,
that's what I see.

866
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,170
I see this culture rotting from within.
Okay.

867
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,880
And,
and this all link itself,

868
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:46,714
literally,

869
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:58,710
we have this bit of combat.
Let's say it produced a scandal.

870
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,380
Now we actually talk about it.
Yeah.

871
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,273
No tricks.
Just to conversation and then everybody 

872
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:06,940
wins.
Right?

873
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,000
Because I can admit whatever mistakes I 
made,

874
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,520
she can admit whatever mistakes she 
made,

875
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:13,623
we can drop the persona.
So you're saying the polarization that 

876
00:49:16,211 --> 00:49:19,330
we're seeing right now that we are 
speaking out,

877
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:20,733
it's not in the future.
We will x out that polarization if we 

878
00:49:24,281 --> 00:49:25,114
don't,
if we keep accelerating and especially 

879
00:49:26,591 --> 00:49:28,930
if we keep accelerating it with lies.
Yeah.

880
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,431
You know,
and,

881
00:49:29,431 --> 00:49:31,210
and this,
this whole,

882
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,080
um,
channel four rats,

883
00:49:35,081 --> 00:49:38,120
nest is like 90% lies.
Yeah.

884
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:39,430
Maybe more.
Yeah.

885
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,211
And I'll,
you know,

886
00:49:40,211 --> 00:49:42,280
a lot of it's ideologically motivated 
lies,

887
00:49:42,281 --> 00:49:44,650
but it doesn't matter.
It's still lies.

888
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:46,930
Like Kathy,
as I said,

889
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,233
there was virtually nothing she said in 
that interview that was actually coming 

890
00:49:53,711 --> 00:49:55,090
from her,
like,

891
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:58,110
like a deep part of her soul,
of her persona.

892
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,730
It was all persona.
It was all persona and,

893
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,970
and,
and all use of words in a,

894
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:07,300
in a expedient manner as tools to 
obtain.

895
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:12,330
I think probably probably status,
dominance,

896
00:50:12,331 --> 00:50:14,500
status and reputation.
Yeah.

897
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:17,140
I mean what advice would you give to 
people too,

898
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:21,080
to navigate this new world?
The first is a free your mind.

899
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:26,440
Be Aware of the fact that the habits of 
the Blue Church and and how it works,

900
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:28,580
um,
don't work anymore.

901
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,473
Recognize that your way of making sense 
in the world that used to work don't 

902
00:50:32,121 --> 00:50:32,954
work and you really,
really need to set yourself free to 

903
00:50:34,521 --> 00:50:38,090
begin learning a new child's mind,
beginner's mind.

904
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:39,963
Um,
second,

905
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:41,503
um,
this by nature must in fact be 

906
00:50:43,551 --> 00:50:48,551
exploratory.
So swim do not make sense prematurely in

907
00:50:49,461 --> 00:50:50,294
spite of the fact that the world feels 
dangerous instead of the five that you 

908
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:57,551
may want to protect yourself in this 
dangerous world I'm doing.

909
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:02,120
So to quickly,
uh,

910
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:07,240
does not allow the natural exploratory
approach to do what it needs to do.

911
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:10,423
Really just listen and learn.
Go all the way that back down to human 

912
00:51:14,811 --> 00:51:16,670
base.
Turn it inward.

913
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:22,600
Learn how fear shows up in you.
Learn how not to allow fear to drive the

914
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:24,014
choices that you make.
Learn how to listen to the whole way 

915
00:51:27,561 --> 00:51:29,510
that all of you perceives what's going 
on.

916
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:31,550
Become more integrated with your own 
body.

917
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:36,470
Go out into nature,
spend a lot of time not connected to the

918
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:37,304
chaos that's going on.
And a lot of time reconnecting yourself 

919
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,264
with your fundamental capacity to 
perceive reality in all the different 

920
00:51:44,211 --> 00:51:46,610
modalities that human beings have the 
capacity to do.

921
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:53,450
Then relearn how to use other human 
beings as allies and figuring out how to

922
00:51:53,451 --> 00:51:54,284
make sense of the world.
I mean that really relearn like we have 

923
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:58,813
been abused and a constrained by 
institutional frameworks that remove us 

924
00:52:04,941 --> 00:52:07,880
from our own native capabilities.
So relearn that,

925
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,740
understand how to be a friend and an 
ally,

926
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:13,910
how to have a conversation with somebody
where you're really listening closely to

927
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:16,580
get a sense of what their perspective 
brings to you,

928
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:19,220
where you're not obligated to agree with
them.

929
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:23,870
We are not obligated to move out of what
you feel is right to form some new,

930
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,100
uh,
consensus,

931
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:25,934
reality.
But where you're actually authentically 

932
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:28,663
recognizing that their perspective has 
some capacity to bring richness to your 

933
00:52:31,911 --> 00:52:34,220
perspective.
Just by the way,

934
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:36,890
is almost exclusively possible in 
person.

935
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,920
And what we're doing right now is an o 
cavers and epic need.

936
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:40,763
We'd be very mindful of the fact that a 
linear broadcast is bad and even 

937
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:49,370
interactive bandwidth like this is not 
good enough.

938
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,453
You know,
you've got to learn from raw physical 

939
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:54,283
and get yourself into places where your 
consensus reality and your habits are 

940
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,110
willfully destroyed.
It to human,

941
00:53:00,111 --> 00:53:04,250
to human conversations and,
and get as far with ideology as you can.

942
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:07,460
Your job is not to know what the fuck is
going on.

943
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:08,803
Your job has to be absolutely certain 
that you have no idea what the fuck is 

944
00:53:10,761 --> 00:53:14,390
going on and learn how to feel from raw 
chaos,

945
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:19,130
from raw uncertainty up
then,

946
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:20,443
and only then are you finally able to 
begin the journey of beginning form a 

947
00:53:25,381 --> 00:53:27,240
collective intelligence in this new 
environment.

948
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:28,943
That's my advice.

949
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:34,090
This is why we've created rubber wisdom 
to host these conversations,

950
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,373
to try and unpack what's going on and 
through our workshops and events start 

951
00:53:39,851 --> 00:53:42,490
to build this collective intelligence 
for the future.
