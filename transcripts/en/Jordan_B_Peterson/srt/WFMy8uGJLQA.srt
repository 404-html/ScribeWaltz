1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,180
Uncut version,
any

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,950
computer
say

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,633
that takes the
people come in and do it on a computer 

4
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:33,921
instead of
have you read his book?

5
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,703
Were there before anything?
Was there time outs of feminine figure 

6
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:49,024
because she's the wife of absolute,
which is also a dragon and it is the 

7
00:00:53,981 --> 00:00:54,814
case in the ecology that the figure of 
the terrible mother and mother in 

8
00:00:59,801 --> 00:01:03,170
general is often contaminated.
Figure dragging.

9
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:12,190
I don't exactly know
why it is that mythological.

10
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,410
I mean,
most mythological stories described this

11
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,570
creation of the world out of one of two 
things.

12
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:20,330
It's either the body of a giant or it's 
the body of a serpent.

13
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,703
I don't exactly know why it's the body 
of the serpent or wall or a giant for 

14
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,270
that matter.
It's difficult to tell.

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,940
It's in part because the serpent is a 
serpent that eats its own tail.

16
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,793
That's the era.
So you've been reading about and it's a 

17
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:41,200
symbol of the union of opposites and 
from the mythological perspective,

18
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,320
whatever it was that the universe is 
made out of.

19
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,223
Before it was discriminatory,
law objects was everything that's now 

20
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:47,854
discriminative,
all combined into one thing and the 

21
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:54,051
assembles that myth uses to the symbols 
that myth uses to represent that state,

22
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:57,460
which by definition can't be 
represented,

23
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,643
circulate around attempts to,
to represent the union of paradoxical 

24
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:04,894
opposites.

25
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,263
Um,

26
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,900
apple fest,
for example,

27
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:11,734
the Egyptian serpent,
the serpent that eats the sun every 

28
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:16,210
night.
It's the serpent that Ray,

29
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:18,830
who's the son God kills every morning 
when he,

30
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,530
when he,
when he rises again,

31
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,510
raised the god of the Egyptian,
Pharaoh is assimilated to apple.

32
00:02:25,511 --> 00:02:26,344
FIS for the Egyptians was the god that 
was there at before time began and the 

33
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:31,474
same God that will be there after time,
not known at the beginning of time or 

34
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:36,510
the head of time,
but outside of time,

35
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,393
entirely something that surrounds time.
And that's what these fingers are 

36
00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:40,294
attempting these fingers here and 
getting them to represent the same sort 

37
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,080
of idea.
And this is from Ben and in Nigeria,

38
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:47,914
there's a certain design here in the 
serpents in closing the world on a 

39
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:55,000
breast shield.
This is a Mexican calendar stolen within

40
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,860
encircling serpents,
serpents,

41
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,950
head up there.
That's the world.

42
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,370
Again,
the world is the reason the serpent is a

43
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:07,371
road a year because the year is also the
world mythological language tends to mix

44
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:09,251
things up.
Again,

45
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:10,084
it,
it's,

46
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,423
it's very.
It's very frequent for cultures to 

47
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,543
regard the creation of the new year as 
equivalent to the creation of the new 

48
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:21,910
world.
That's why again as in Sumeria,

49
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,070
and that's an extraordinarily 
widespread,

50
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:29,770
a ritual that the day that the dragon is
dispatched and her parts pulled apart to

51
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:38,140
make.
The world is also New Year's Day and the

52
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:42,610
day that the state is renewed,
state is equivalent to the world.

53
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,743
From a mythological perspective,
the state is where order rules as 

54
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:49,030
opposed to chaos.
Chaos has two symbols,

55
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,500
one being the serpent and the other 
being the great mother.

56
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,570
The serpent is the most primordial form 
of chaos.

57
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,020
It's chaos from which everything else is
engendered.

58
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,680
So you could say there's two types of 
chaos.

59
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,460
There's chaos that preceded the division
of order

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,793
and disorder,
and there's the chaos that stands for 

61
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:15,901
disorder as opposed to order
in the Samaritan Inn.

62
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,210
The earliest Sumerian creation 
mythology.

63
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:22,690
For example,
world parents arise from the body of the

64
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:27,220
serpent worth parents on the sky and the
earth.

65
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,120
The earth is assimilated to the female.
Female stands for chaos,

66
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:35,920
but you have to understand that
once you've circumscribed an area,

67
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,783
say like a state,
the area outside of that state is 

68
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,620
conceived of as chaotic.
It's where anomaly roles.

69
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:48,940
It's where novelty rules was a slightly 
different form of chaos that the kind of

70
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:51,670
cast that proceeded the establishment of
any order whatsoever.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,833
You can see that's kind of a subtle 
distinction and I think that's part of 

72
00:04:56,021 --> 00:04:56,854
the reason why the figure of the serpent
and the figure of the great mother get 

73
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:04,351
contaminated so easily is the great 
mother is novelty from the standpoint of

74
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,374
ordered.
The serpent is novelty before there was 

75
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:09,760
any division between order and chaos.
Okay,

76
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:15,220
so see if we can take a look at some 
representations here.

77
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,280
Here's two more.
This is from Babylonian.

78
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,113
As the ocean ringing world,
you can't see much of worlds in the 

79
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:29,284
middle.
The oceans around the side and there's 

80
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:31,764
just.
You can just see the edges of the 

81
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,540
serpent's tail.
There is not much left of them,

82
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,900
there's not much left of the tablet,
and then this is from Italy.

83
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:41,080
In the 17th century is the four corners 
of the world.

84
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,221
The world,
by the way,

85
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:43,054
is often,
and this is also very difficult to 

86
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:45,574
understand,
the world of orders generally 

87
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:49,360
represented by a symbol that looks like 
that.

88
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,800
That's the world.
It's a Mandela.

89
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:51,634
It's a circle,
is divided into four parts like 

90
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:55,570
paradise.
The paradise in Genesys has exactly that

91
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:56,404
structure.
There's not phone from which for Rivers 

92
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,263
Flow,
the fountains right in the center where 

93
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:00,354
the four rivers divided up into four 
parts and it's a circle and that's a 

94
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:05,750
model for Jerusalem and Jerusalem is the
heavenly city,

95
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,130
and the heavenly city of Jerusalem is 
the archetype of log,

96
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,993
so to speak,
upon which all actual cities are 

97
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:13,460
predicated.

98
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,760
So they're always built in an attempt to
imitate and having a city.

99
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,140
And that's common model for,
for city construction.

100
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:21,974
Again,
it seems to be more or less distributed 

101
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,690
all around the world.
Now,

102
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,460
the funny thing is my daughter started 
drawing the world,

103
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:31,460
hear about it about three weeks ago.
And uh,

104
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,413
she drew a finger exactly like this.
This is the world she draws and divided 

105
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,370
one line with divided and not.
Um,

106
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,813
I just wanted to ask them why a 
representation of a chaos before I was 

107
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,123
the unknown and the unknown is so 
important and why there's such drive to 

108
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,083
since from the time when I'm in 
representation as possible in the world 

109
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:57,200
would already have been divided into the
unknown and the unknown.

110
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,370
Well,
again,

111
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,140
I think the reason is,
is because

112
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,773
the argument that are trying to put 
forth in the next few chapters in this 

113
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,320
book is that the thing you need to know,
most of all,

114
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,880
if you think of a story as a map of 
meaning,

115
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,133
it's a,
it's a description of behavioral 

116
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:19,970
patterns that are designed to help you 
make order out of chaos.

117
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:20,923
Okay?
In order to generate a story that has 

118
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:26,564
generalized validity instead of one 
that's just relevant for a given 

119
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:34,520
occasion,
you may know how to do one thing and you

120
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,354
can teach someone how to do that thing.
But knowing how to do one thing is 

121
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:40,154
nowhere near as useful as knowing how to
generate patterns of knowing things and 

122
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,530
I think part of the drive to represent 
the unknown per se,

123
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,830
it's part of the overall attempt to come
to a representation of the domain,

124
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:55,634
so to speak,
of the always present unknown know your 

125
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:02,960
question is why try supposed,
why

126
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,433
is it necessary to generate an image,
say like the serpent rather than an 

127
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:10,010
image of the great mother,
which is just normally.

128
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,310
I don't know exactly the answer to that.
I mean I don't even know if

129
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,303
all I.
all I can say is that as far as I've 

130
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,403
been able to determine what people have 
done is attempt to represent the source 

131
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:23,144
of things.
And I mean we still do that obviously 

132
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:30,470
scientifically people are more than 
willing to speculate about the origin of

133
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:31,304
things previous to the.
Even the potential established with a 

134
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:36,920
baby or even could have experienced it.
And it seems to me,

135
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,033
well it seems to be just a side effect 
or a direct effect of our general 

136
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:48,521
curiosity about everything
once,

137
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,823
once.
So could you say that once we've been 

138
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:53,774
able to define ourselves in time,
we want to have an explanation for all 

139
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:01,620
time?
I would say when it also maybe like,

140
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,703
I don't know about this,
this like I find this stuff very 

141
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:05,454
compelling.
Obviously it seems to me that things 

142
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:13,560
aren't necessarily just attempt to 
describe the unknown there right there.

143
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,090
The representations to me seemed to be 
accurate.

144
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,200
I don't know where they came from or how
they developed their approximations that

145
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:27,840
have taken place over thousands and 
thousands of years.

146
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,180
I don't exactly know why.
As such as represented as a circuit,

147
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,340
it has something to do with the 
conjunction of opposites.

148
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,330
A serpent is something that's wind and 
it's something that's on the ground,

149
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,793
so it's a niche.
It's an image of the Union of whatever 

150
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:43,194
it is that's represented by spirit,
which is usually something like 

151
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:48,100
consciousness or the domain that 
consciousness hysterical.

152
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,870
That's the masculine will be at least 
mythologically speaking.

153
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,460
The fact that the serpent crawls on the 
ground gives the feminine aspect because

154
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:57,294
it's tied to matter.
It can also shed its skin so it can 

155
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,384
trips for.
So the mythological symbol is trying to 

156
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:03,264
say that don known as such with 
something that combined opposites that 

157
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:09,180
are generally viewed as separate bowl 
and that can transform itself.

158
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,770
He can't say anything about it like 
it's,

159
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,560
it's,
it's a weird category because.

160
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,023
Well loud.
So you attempted to to describe it in 

161
00:10:18,391 --> 00:10:19,224
this bowl.
Now something formless he had complete 

162
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:22,590
that existed before heaven and earth 
without sound,

163
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,810
without substance dependent on nothing,
unchanging.

164
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:25,883
What may think of it as the mother of 
all things under heaven has doubt 

165
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,270
actually.
And it's the,

166
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,163
it's the source of everything from the 
perspective of Chinese mythology and he 

167
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,990
points out that as soon as you talk 
about it,

168
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:40,020
you're not talking about.
Because as soon as you categorize it,

169
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:45,330
it's not an attempt to be like a 
purposefully obscure.

170
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,450
The point that is being made biopsy for 
example,

171
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:52,590
is that as soon as you try to talk about
something that's uncategorizable,

172
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:54,750
you've already categorized it.
You've already got away from it.

173
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,003
So we're in a problematic position here 
because we're trying to come up with a 

174
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:00,624
representation of something that existed
before any representations were even 

175
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:04,044
possible.
So all I can tell you about her just to 

176
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,283
see what the representations are now,
I think the purpose of them was because 

177
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:15,150
we've been attempting to generate a Meta
story as a species,

178
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:18,660
and the story is how to adapt to the 
fact that the result unknown territory.

179
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,210
Remember the dragon has other attributes
to.

180
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,343
I read a book called Grendel,
which was a novel published in the 

181
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,770
seventies recently that the debt or the 
dragon in there,

182
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,930
there's a mythological character named 
Grendel who eats people

183
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,870
and he's constantly attacking this one 
king

184
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,243
from deal.
There's a little Scandinavian and it's 

185
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:45,464
written from the perspective of the 
monster instead of perspective 

186
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,750
perspective of people.
Anyways,

187
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,623
Grendel is this monster eats.
He keeps attacking this kingdom and 

188
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:59,131
eating people and he's completely.
The dragon has made him invulnerable.

189
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,453
You can't be defeated,
but the consequences of his repeated 

190
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:06,070
attacks on this kingdom is the kingdom 
starts to fortify itself very,

191
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:08,050
very heavily because it's always being 
attacked.

192
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,750
It as a consequence of spreads his 
dominion everywhere.

193
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,030
So it's,
it's a,

194
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,110
it's a morality play.
In that sense.

195
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,560
It says that one of the functions of 
constant death,

196
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,113
threat of death is to produce a 
tremendous amount of power in response 

197
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:22,780
to it.
Anyways,

198
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:25,210
there was one point in the book where 
grandma goes and talks to the dragon.

199
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,960
This dragon can see the beginning and 
the end of time.

200
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,590
He's also involved in vulnerable.
He sits on gold.

201
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,840
That's another attribute of the dragging
say,

202
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:35,674
well,
I need classic hero mythology that you 

203
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,980
hear those optic to go through the 
dragon,

204
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:40,020
right?
As soon as he,

205
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,983
soon as he faces the Dragon,
he gets the gold that the dragon has 

206
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,440
drinks back.
That's another.

207
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,590
That's another indication of the 
juxtaposition of opposites.

208
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,410
The story is basically telling you what 
the dragon is,

209
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:52,870
something that can devour you,
breathes fire.

210
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:55,270
After all,
it's a very potent transformative agent.

211
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:57,310
Annotate eternal.
If you face it,

212
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:58,210
sits on a treasure,
though.

213
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,360
It's very dangerous.
If you.

214
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,530
If you face the dragons voluntarily,
that's the story of the myth anyways.

215
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,050
If you face the dragon voluntarily,
then you can get the treasure.

216
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,540
Will you bring the treasure back to the 
community that it's changed?

217
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,403
That's a story mode adaptation.
That's why those dragons stories pop up 

218
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:16,280
over and over.
It's always sitting on Treasury,

219
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,180
so it's another.
You can see there how that image sort of

220
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,160
blends into the image of the great 
mother and it's positive on one hand,

221
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,930
negative on the other.
I think it's a story,

222
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,793
not a habituation,
but exploration generated that 

223
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,623
application in many taken another very 
archaic notion and that's the notion of 

224
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:35,734
human sacrifice.
I think I talked to you a little bit 

225
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:39,820
about this before.
If you dig down into most cultures,

226
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,280
if you get down to a sufficiently 
archaic layer,

227
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:43,114
you could find a strategy and time 
during which that culture practice team 

228
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:52,030
and sacrifices,
that's sufficiently peculiar practice so

229
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,950
that Arthur Kessler,
when he wrote,

230
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,873
he wrote a book called the machine that 
was quite famous back in the early 

231
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:58,780
seventies.
He said,

232
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,613
the fact that human beings practice 
sacrifice at virtually all levels of 

233
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,990
culture,
our culture,

234
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,893
all cultures so far identified was the 
indication that there was something 

235
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:08,980
really biologically wrong with us.

236
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,250
That was such an insane thing to do,
but what?

237
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,323
What?
Those cultures that were practicing 

238
00:14:14,381 --> 00:14:16,480
ritualistic sacrifice.
As far as I can tell,

239
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:20,830
what they were doing was acting out the 
idea that the thing that was valued most

240
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,813
had to be sacrificed to the unknown in 
order for constant adaptation to 

241
00:14:26,771 --> 00:14:27,604
continue,
so it was either like the sacrificial 

242
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:33,640
victim was either you could feel him as 
a hero because that was often the case,

243
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:34,474
so he was a hero who who would be killed
and that his body would be distributed 

244
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,850
among the crowd and they'd eat it.
That's one ritual of it.

245
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,890
It's just like the Christian mass by the
way,

246
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,140
is exactly the same idea and the notion 
was that to to move towards divinity,

247
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:47,974
it was necessary to incorporate because 
that's the most concrete way of putting 

248
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:52,454
it,
incorporate the body or the essence of 

249
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:57,220
this thing that's constantly being 
offered up to the unknown.

250
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,423
That was the only way that you could 
continue insuring that constant 

251
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,053
adaptation was going to take place.
So that's the sacrificial aspect of the 

252
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:05,264
hero.
And then there's also the sacrificial 

253
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:09,560
aspect of the king and those two things 
get confused as well.

254
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,660
The king isn't a hero.
The king is the fonder of the hero,

255
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,050
or he's the thing that hero generates.
You can look at it either way.

256
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,370
The king is also something that has to 
be sacrificed,

257
00:15:21,371 --> 00:15:22,204
that Kenya is the embodiment of 
behavioral patterns that had adaptive 

258
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:26,444
significance in the past.
Also schemas of representation and 

259
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:32,090
they're useful for guiding adaptation,
but if the environment shifts suddenly,

260
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:32,924
then they have to be changed and the 
only way they can be changed as well 

261
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,160
from the mythological perspective,
if their sacrifice,

262
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,103
that's what those rituals were trying to
act out now as you can check around in 

263
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:43,604
the literature to two year old,
two year old to satisfy your own 

264
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,960
curiosity.
As far as I can tell,

265
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,020
I've never been.
I've never found an explanation.

266
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:54,080
If you sacrificial ritual that was fun,
prehensile,

267
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,483
that didn't make.
That doesn't fit along that theoretical 

268
00:15:58,731 --> 00:15:59,564
line.

269
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,973
So if you can,
if you could accept the argument that 

270
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:06,410
people acted out ideas before they 
understood that.

271
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,743
That's what I was trying to explain it.
Part of that neural psychological 

272
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:12,860
chapter,
say evolutionary pressures,

273
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:15,620
select our behavioral patterns.
We don't invent them all.

274
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,643
If we experiment a lot,
some behavioral patterns last and some 

275
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:20,720
don't,
so I think we get.

276
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:21,823
We get behavioral patterns that are 
established as a consequence of 

277
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:24,734
evolutionary pressures.
They're established long before we can 

278
00:16:26,571 --> 00:16:29,150
understand,
so we get the behavioral pattern down.

279
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,150
Then we started watching what we're 
doing and when we're watching what we're

280
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:34,670
doing,
we tell stories and the stories reflect

281
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,033
their first order,
representations of behavioral patterns 

282
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:44,231
that that work so people,
people's that survived were able to give

283
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:47,750
up the thing that was most important to 
them when it was necessary,

284
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,853
and over the course of,
I would say hundreds of thousands of 

285
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:51,824
years,
we gathered enough observations about 

286
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:57,350
success to draw some general conclusions
about what it meant.

287
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,860
We know already in this and obtain by 
the Mesopotamian times,

288
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,143
whatever it was that Martech represented
was already positive as necessarily 

289
00:17:05,511 --> 00:17:09,380
occupying the highest position in the in
the dominance hierarchy of gods.

290
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,960
So that's already established 5,000 
years ago.

291
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:12,794
By the time people could write.
We knew that story and it's debatable 

292
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,400
whether or not we knew what it meant,
but then you have to ask yourself,

293
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:21,530
when you say that you know what 
something means,

294
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:22,364
what do you,
what do you say in one thing you're 

295
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:27,770
saying is like if you know something,
you can act it out and the fact that you

296
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:31,280
can act on does not necessarily mean you
have an accurate representation of it or

297
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:32,114
that you can say anything about it,
words that are or that it was 

298
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:35,684
constructed as a consequence of word 
verbally and thinking that it was 

299
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,424
rational or any of those things,
knowing something is acting it out and 

300
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,800
that's wasted and it's images of wisdom 
are collected in mythology.

301
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,240
Far as I can tell.
Otherwise you have to come up with it.

302
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,420
Well,
I mean you can try,

303
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,790
try,
try as you want,

304
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,073
come up with an alternate explanation 
for things that on the face of it seems 

305
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,250
insane.
Sacrificial rituals.

306
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,770
You have to realize these things have 
lasted long time.

307
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,200
When I made allusion to the Christian 
mass,

308
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,510
that that's direct light.
When you eat the way for that represents

309
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:10,344
Christ.
He's the sacrificial victim and the 

310
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:12,864
incorporation of that way for it's made 
out of wheat because wheat is it dying 

311
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:20,541
and resurrecting a plant by the way,
so there's a lot of vegetation going,

312
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,890
symbolism that it is assimilated into 
that we host.

313
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,203
When you meet that notion is that you're
supposed to incorporate whatever is at 

314
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:34,761
the essence of Christ.
People still do that and so it's a.

315
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,103
it's a symbolic representation of 
sacrificial ritual and it's supposed to 

316
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:43,590
produce an effect.

317
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,793
It's got more and more abstract as you 
can tell people no actually engage in 

318
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,900
sacrificial rituals anymore.
Although we kind of do that and we still

319
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:55,890
do their new year's.
Say you make your resolutions,

320
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,753
the notion there is the death of the old
self and the birth of the new self and 

321
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,230
you see they're still symbols that hang 
around you.

322
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,113
The culture from from archaic terms 
about the New Year to kind of the old 

323
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,030
year who's hobbling along.
He's killed off to make room for the new

324
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,863
year and that's when you're supposed to 
formulate your resolutions because 

325
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:17,720
that's a time when you can scrap your 
pastor Vernon,

326
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,830
so to speak,
and give rise to a new self.

327
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,180
No sorts of those sorts of rituals.
Those sorts of ideas are very useful.

328
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,180
It's very difficult for people to escape
often from the weight of their past.

329
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,043
That's sort of their accumulative habits
or the way that they construe the world 

330
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,360
like there's certain utility and now 
because God you as far as you as you are

331
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:37,194
now,
but there's a tremendous amount of 

332
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:39,540
weight so I can.

333
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,680
I can remember,
for example,

334
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,263
I'm from a very small town and the thing
about being from a small town perhaps 

335
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:47,640
it's not so much different.
The city is that everyone knows you.

336
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,853
When everyone knows you,
you're trapped by your social 

337
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:52,284
representations,
so it's very difficult not to stay who 

338
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:56,214
you were because your behavior is always
modified by those around you into a 

339
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,270
shape.
They can predict.

340
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:03,270
Even if you want to change,
if you leave a place like that.

341
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,433
In fact,
anytime you leave anywhere that's the 

342
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:07,920
changing of your world,
you have a chance to,

343
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,190
to abandon your old personality,
develop a new one.

344
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,003
Anyways,
let me show you some of these 

345
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:20,070
representations.
The only way you can get a feel,

346
00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:23,340
I think for this sort of thing is fine.
What else am I thinking about it?

347
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,920
I want to show you that.
Well,

348
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,400
I'm not sure
how

349
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:38,190
new year got so far Easter
because Easter shift.

350
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

351
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:45,390
Well Christmas isn't very far with this 
place from the new year and the thing is

352
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:48,010
is that the son is born on the 21st of 
December.

353
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,073
That's why.
That's why Christmas Day is so close to 

354
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:54,310
the 21st of December.
So because the days start getting longer

355
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:55,144
again.
So I guess that's part of the answer is 

356
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,483
that the Christian ceremony of Christ's 
birth was assimilated to the rebirth of 

357
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:04,354
the sun,
so kind of occupied that space in the 

358
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,440
calendar.
That was the.

359
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,490
That was the first part.
Yeah.

360
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,630
Yeah.
I know,

361
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,260
I know.
No,

362
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,093
I don't.
I don't know the answer to that 

363
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,363
question.
I do know that's why there are rabbits 

364
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,640
and eggs at Easter.
Right,

365
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,020
right,
right.

366
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,080
Okay.
Right.

367
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,850
I'm not saying that.
Why is,

368
00:21:30,851 --> 00:21:33,550
why is why is in eastern in December.
I'm saying,

369
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:35,200
why isn't the first day of the year?

370
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,700
I don't know.
I mean,

371
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,560
I,
I don't know.

372
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,570
I knew you could speculate that there's 
tension between the two dates.

373
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,970
Rabbit's hole when Easter.
Well,

374
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:49,804
they're symbols of rebirth.
Takeaway rabbits are symbols of 

375
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:56,800
fertility and ate eggs.
Easter bunny.

376
00:21:56,801 --> 00:21:58,660
What do you think these things come from
somewhere?

377
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:00,703
The vast unknown,
like I just told you like five minutes 

378
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:05,200
ago,
that we do all sorts of things.

379
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:08,170
We don't understand.
We act out things we don't understand.

380
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,213
So I tell you what,
the Easter bunny meetings and everyone 

381
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:11,614
laughs because everyone knows about the 
Easter bunny and no one has a clue what 

382
00:22:13,781 --> 00:22:16,990
it means.
So that's a perfect example of how these

383
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,780
sort of archaic ideas can continue to 
exist.

384
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,830
People are absolutely so to speak,
unconscious of the meeting,

385
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,340
which basically means you act them out,
but you don't know what you're doing.

386
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,010
So for example,
of something that

387
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:35,703
represents rebirth because it's some 
sort of an archetype or an example of 

388
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:42,510
something that represents me because 
it's been,

389
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:44,630
well,
it's a,

390
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,020
it's a fertility symbol and it was a 
pagan.

391
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,890
It was a pagan symbol of fertility and 
as as far as I know,

392
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:51,724
it just got it just got assimilated to 
the Christian festival of eastern hung 

393
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,410
long hung around long width and so we 
speak and the.

394
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:04,910
Are they sort to re re chosen as symbols
that chaos that proceeded in division or

395
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,853
or or are they ancient temples that have
simply been pretty simple that we have 

396
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:19,150
today?
That's a good question.

397
00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:22,480
I'm going to show you a bunch of videos 
and I don't know the answer to that.

398
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:23,314
I think personally I think that when 
people start thinking about those sorts 

399
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:29,854
of things,
those symbols naturally come to mind 

400
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,360
regardless of whether they're passed 
down.

401
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,070
Although they are also passed now that 
because I can't understand why they keep

402
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:40,570
popping up everywhere.
Otherwise.

403
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,920
The other thing is this is an argument 
that human too.

404
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,960
He said,
he said,

405
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:46,420
well,
symbols won't for a long time to listen.

406
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,770
Particularly Apropos,
no.

407
00:23:48,771 --> 00:23:53,600
They happen to match some aid priority 
concept in psychology,

408
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:54,434
academic psychology.
We don't give much credence to the 

409
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:57,830
notion of the archetypes of the 
collective unconscious,

410
00:23:57,831 --> 00:23:59,360
for example,
that's observed.

411
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,493
That's because that is because we are 
unbelievably ignorant historically in 

412
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:06,230
psychology here.
I'll give you an example.

413
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:07,900
I was reading with and let the other 
day,

414
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:08,783
you know,
when the Spaniards came to the new 

415
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:11,800
world,
they were looking for gold for elder out

416
00:24:11,801 --> 00:24:12,920
of the city of gold.
That's.

417
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:17,000
That's an analog of paradise.
They're also looking for the fountain of

418
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:17,834
Youth.
Part of the reason that they ended up 

419
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,024
going up north on their trips was 
because they met abandoned wandering 

420
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,130
Indians who were looking for the same 
thing.

421
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,293
The Indians told them a whole set of 
stories about where this paradise might 

422
00:24:29,181 --> 00:24:30,810
make and away they went.
You.

423
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,710
That's pretty peculiar.
You know,

424
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,330
it's an hour.

425
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,710
I can give you the reference for that.
It's an these book,

426
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,510
the sacred and the profane.
I mean,

427
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:43,511
it's difficult to account for that.
We can't account for it by by a while.

428
00:24:43,911 --> 00:24:47,000
You could say both ideas came from a 
single source,

429
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:47,834
some tens of thousands of years previous
it'd be like 17,000 years because I 

430
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,324
think between 10 and 17,000 years 
because I think that's when the native 

431
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:58,070
Americans crossed the land bridge into 
North America,

432
00:24:58,610 --> 00:24:59,443
but then you have to explain why those 
ideas hung around for at least 10,000 

433
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:03,884
years.
I guess there's a difference between 

434
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:09,731
saying that
or that that determines the shape of our

435
00:25:10,701 --> 00:25:12,770
culture and those ideas.
Yeah.

436
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,580
Well,
I think.

437
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,560
I think what happens is that.
Well,

438
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:17,720
let's take another take the notion of 
the snake,

439
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:18,554
for example,
like we know that we know that novel 

440
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:23,204
phenomena have the capacity to grip your
attention so then you could say that 

441
00:25:27,771 --> 00:25:28,604
any,
anything that has the capacity to grip 

442
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:31,784
your intention would be a useful symbol 
for novelty and it's certainly the case 

443
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:38,900
that snakes have the capacity to grip 
your attention.

444
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,943
So that might.
That might be the process by which the 

445
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:46,730
symbol's not only originally generated 
but renewed when it has to be renewed.

446
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:51,210
I'll show you a picture of Kelly.
I put it in the manuscript and anyways,

447
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,193
I mean it is the case that innate like 
the domain of the novel always appears 

448
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:04,340
to us as simultaneously threatening and 
promising with threat having the initial

449
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:06,850
operation,
if the phenomena is up sufficiently,

450
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,250
have sufficient novelty,
and that's in board,

451
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,533
right?
I mean that's part of the structure of 

452
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,460
our nervous system,
our capacity oriented,

453
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,040
unpredictable.
Now

454
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,993
it's also the case that we seem to be 
able to generate an effect to things 

455
00:26:23,241 --> 00:26:26,600
like snakes easier than we can do things
like electric outlet,

456
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,680
even though the environmental danger of 
perhaps being reversed,

457
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,830
so there's,
there's at least a kind of a tendency in

458
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:34,664
our nervous system to acquire fear to 
spiders and to bare teeth and to snakes 

459
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:42,470
and to fire easier than other objects.

460
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,303
So perhaps you don't need much of a,
an underlying biological knowledge to 

461
00:26:48,661 --> 00:26:52,020
ensure that a certain class of symbols 
constantly gets regenerated.

462
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,550
So
we know the not the novel,

463
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,503
the domain of the novel has the same
attributes that Rudolf Otto wrote a 

464
00:27:01,951 --> 00:27:05,580
seminal book in 1946 called the nature 
of the Holy Spirit.

465
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:10,050
The holy phenomena is newness.
That's a word you coined.

466
00:27:10,051 --> 00:27:10,884
It has two aspects,
a fascinating aspect and the terrifying 

467
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:14,730
aspect,
and again,

468
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:18,430
I think he's really relating to he's 
describing the same sort of phenomenon,

469
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,663
is that we're innately compelled to 
Orient and Tan and to consider on 

470
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:26,244
inspiring for that matter any 
sufficiently dramatic manifestation of 

471
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:30,054
the novel.
It's also the case that it's perfectly 

472
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:33,714
reasonable to make the presumption that 
the world is generated as a consequence 

473
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:41,760
of our contact with with anomalous 
information because it is.

474
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,810
That is the place where we generate 
everything that we take for granted,

475
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:46,883
including ourselves.
So it strikes me that this is a 

476
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:49,914
relatively mythological perspective,
is it seems to me to be a completely 

477
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:56,520
coherent viewpoint.
Now people say,

478
00:27:56,521 --> 00:27:57,354
well,
the fact that something's coherent 

479
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,610
doesn't make its true,
make it true,

480
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,850
and that's certainly the case because 
paranoid delusions or coherent,

481
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,890
but theoretically they're not true.

482
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,810
Then you have to figure out what do you 
need in addition to coherency?

483
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,513
Well,
that's a tougher.

484
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,353
That's a tougher question.
If you act the story out and your 

485
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,583
emotions are arranged in a manner that 
you find better subjectively than they 

486
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:24,324
were before,
would you say that that would be 

487
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:27,750
evidence for the efficiency of the 
story,

488
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:32,600
the efficacy of the story for its truth?
Can you just define shoot?

489
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,373
Well,
I'm just wondering like one of the 

490
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:37,104
things I wondered about constantly when 
I was teaching my personality class for 

491
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:40,164
example,
is these constant panoply of different 

492
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:44,730
personality theories.
They're all predicated.

493
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,853
They have certain elements in common,
one of them being a necessity to face 

494
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:49,944
those bits of your experience that you 
really can't comprehend very well to 

495
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,053
face novelty.
That's something that's really core to 

496
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:56,304
them,
but they vary a lot and in the clinical 

497
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,740
literature there's a fair amount of 
evidence that

498
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,163
there isn't much difference between one 
therapeutic approach and another in 

499
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:08,610
terms of their efficiency,
they're all pretty good.

500
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,213
The only thing that's kind of known for 
sure is that if you're an eclectic 

501
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:15,120
psychotherapist and you sort of pick and
choose,

502
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,240
you don't do as well as you do if you're
committed to one particular law,

503
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,860
even though it doesn't matter what the 
model is.

504
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,083
So then it struck me that while perhaps 
the reason for this is that if you go 

505
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:25,710
into therapy and have an incoherent 
story,

506
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,410
which basically means you don't know 
what direction to go in,

507
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,393
your goals aren't set very well.
You don't have a good definition of 

508
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:32,274
yourself.
That means you're emotions are 

509
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:36,180
dysregulated.
If I give you a story that's coherent,

510
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,223
that's an improvement.
Just the fact that it's coherent is an 

511
00:29:39,931 --> 00:29:43,500
improvement over your incoherence story 
and maybe there's other the other.

512
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,513
Then the next thing to do what he does 
specify what else you need from a story 

513
00:29:48,191 --> 00:29:49,270
other than coherence.

514
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,103
And again,
that's what I'm trying to do with this 

515
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:51,664
course.
So what I'm wondering is like we would 

516
00:29:54,011 --> 00:29:54,844
say that therapy is effective when the 
client says I'm better and when the or 

517
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:02,860
when the therapist says you're better or
when both due or when.

518
00:30:02,861 --> 00:30:04,840
Some other people do,
but the point is it's still,

519
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,670
it's still based on,
well,

520
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,523
when a client says I'm better,
usually what they mean is I'm not going 

521
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:13,870
to commit suicide now,
so I'm going to have depressed.

522
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,910
I'm.
I may be somewhat anxious,

523
00:30:15,911 --> 00:30:19,180
but I think I can handle it or and I'm 
nowhere near as anxious as I used to be.

524
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,670
So negative emotion has been brought 
under control.

525
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,250
I'm hopeful about the future,
you know,

526
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,710
and I can see that life might be 
satisfied.

527
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,993
That means their emotions of being 
regulated and that's what a coherent 

528
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:30,904
story does.
Since stories are about patterns of 

529
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:36,550
action that are adaptive,
that make well,

530
00:30:36,551 --> 00:30:37,384
that makes a certain amount of sense 
because when we're acting on the 

531
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:39,994
environment,
what we're trying to do is to transform 

532
00:30:41,891 --> 00:30:45,040
it into a place where our emotions are 
optimally balanced,

533
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:48,040
where we're not subjected to pain or 
anxiety,

534
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,173
where we have hope for the future and 
with how we view life is satisfied in 

535
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:55,040
addition to being coherent.

536
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,490
Story should also be relatively stable.
Well,

537
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:03,220
it has to have two aspects.
It has to be stable,

538
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,383
but it also has the.
It has to have the capacity to update 

539
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:07,840
itself with stability.
That's right.

540
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,733
That's right.
So the best story is a story about how 

541
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:13,210
the update stories,
when that's necessary,

542
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,710
and that's the story that hero and wild 
anyways,

543
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:22,770
clients
would.

544
00:31:22,771 --> 00:31:24,340
I know.
I wouldn't suggest that.

545
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,023
No,
I would say actually the to the degree 

546
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:31,750
that a therapy is effective,
it acts that out because for example,

547
00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:35,530
in one of the most effective behavior 
therapy techniques is exposure,

548
00:31:35,531 --> 00:31:36,364
so to speak,
and what's what exposure is supposed to 

549
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,990
do is is producing situation,
which is wrong.

550
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,400
That isn't what exposure does.
If you like.

551
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:46,450
If someone's afraid of getting into an 
elevator,

552
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,703
what you do is teach them behavioral 
strategies to transform and elevate it 

553
00:31:51,831 --> 00:31:53,050
into something that's positive.

554
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,153
It looks like habituation because 
because mostly what they do is model 

555
00:31:57,791 --> 00:32:00,370
you,
but that's still what you do it like you

556
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:03,460
don't have to think.
You don't even habituate to the unknown.

557
00:32:03,461 --> 00:32:05,240
What you do is explore it and classify 
it.

558
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:08,980
It's just that our experiment procedures
have been really poorly constraint.

559
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,540
I think.
So they're trivial to fight.

560
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,330
If you're in the lab and I pay you 100 
tones that are the same,

561
00:32:16,331 --> 00:32:17,164
and then the nonvolatile,
we'll orient to that and if I keep 

562
00:32:20,261 --> 00:32:23,440
playing it over and over,
you're orienting response to go away and

563
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,221
then I would say,
well,

564
00:32:24,221 --> 00:32:26,200
you've habituated,
that's not true.

565
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,183
What you've done is classify that tone 
as meaningless through exploration of 

566
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,074
its properties and you have to be 
sitting there so your exploration is 

567
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:36,310
really constrained.
That's still what you're doing.

568
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,243
So I would say like an answer to your 
question is to the degree that a 

569
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:46,901
therapeutic doctrine is implicitly or 
explicitly modeled on this story,

570
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,140
it works to the degree that it isn't.
It doesn't.

571
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,483
We know like what are the major factors 
in promoting therapeutic improvement is 

572
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,520
exposure to threatening or an almost 
information.

573
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:07,100
So Freud thought something terrible has 
happened to you in the past.

574
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:08,150
That's trauma,
right?

575
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,550
So that's an event that you can't make 
sense of for,

576
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,950
you know,
it's hard to define trauma,

577
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:13,784
but we'll just leave it at that for now.
Freud originally thought that all you 

578
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:18,740
have to do is bring that traumatic 
experience up into consciousness.

579
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,633
That was catharsis cured,
but he knew by the end of his life that 

580
00:33:22,481 --> 00:33:24,650
that didn't work.
Behavior therapists have said,

581
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:24,981
no,
no.

582
00:33:24,981 --> 00:33:28,070
You have to warn them.
You have to adjust someone's actions.

583
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,560
So that's the things.
If what a therapist,

584
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,423
a therapeutic system does is expose you 
to enormous or threatening information 

585
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,243
and make you readjust your behavior as a
consequence to the degree that you did 

586
00:33:39,971 --> 00:33:40,970
that,
you're cured.

587
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,020
If you won't do it here.
No,

588
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:46,863
I don't understand how situation isn't 
what you just described as exploring it 

589
00:33:51,741 --> 00:33:53,230
and getting used to it.
Well,

590
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,430
habits.
Well habituation usually means something

591
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:56,264
like getting used to,
but most of the time when you 

592
00:33:57,651 --> 00:33:58,484
encountered like you don't just 
habituate to a normalist or threatening 

593
00:34:01,311 --> 00:34:02,144
information.
If you're getting pounded flat everyday 

594
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,650
you go to school saying you're a child,
you did not habituate to that.

595
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,290
The only way that you can get used to 
it,

596
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:13,980
so to speak is to alter your behaviors 
or your scheme of representation so that

597
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,060
bullying is no longer pounding on you.
So that means you might have to.

598
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,470
I don't know.
What do you have to do?

599
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,423
Take karate lessons.
Weightlift get a new group of tougher 

600
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:23,900
friends,
bring a knife to school,

601
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,793
something,
but until you transformed the source of 

602
00:34:26,811 --> 00:34:28,960
the threat,
then what?

603
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:31,010
You're not going habitually because you 
don't get used to it.

604
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,350
You'd like to turn it into something 
positive,

605
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:35,470
but certainly turn into something 
positive.

606
00:34:35,471 --> 00:34:36,800
Could you could turn into something 
neutral.

607
00:34:36,801 --> 00:34:39,140
And if you're right,
maybe it stays negative.

608
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,510
Yeah,
neutral is not so bad,

609
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:45,020
but it's not as good as positive.
So if you're really successful,

610
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,153
it's when,
if it's one thing to chase the dragon 

611
00:34:47,421 --> 00:34:49,370
away,
it's another thing to give the gold.

612
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,523
If you're really successful,
you get the goal of chasing the dragon 

613
00:34:52,971 --> 00:34:54,200
ways.
That's not so bad.

614
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:56,060
That's usually what we do.

615
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:02,540
So
patients with dreams where patient

616
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,920
therapy,
patient dream,

617
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,010
right?
So that would be the patient

618
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,113
that was,
that was his interpretation of 

619
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:21,234
transference,
said because he thought that he thought 

620
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:27,270
in fact the therapy was the ritual.
And the first,

621
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,550
the first,
um,

622
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:33,330
he thought that what therapy did was 
basically initiate

623
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,293
a sequence of activities that were 
biologically predicated and that our 

624
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:45,310
capacity to hero worship was one of the 
things that lead our,

625
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:47,670
an outpatient.
So you think you think about this,

626
00:35:47,671 --> 00:35:48,061
I mean,
you know,

627
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:49,710
the children will,
will hear a worship,

628
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,710
they'll imitate,
imitate their parents,

629
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,950
or they'll pick us child who's slightly 
older and act them out,

630
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,530
literally follow them around and 
duplicate their actions.

631
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,603
Say they their capacity for all drives 
their ability to move behavioral 

632
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:06,414
information from one place to another,
or you just thought he reactivated that 

633
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:13,830
in therapy so that the person would 
regard the therapist as well.

634
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,080
For all intents and purposes,
God,

635
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,230
that was all right in a sense because it
could,

636
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,273
it provided some emotional dynamism to 
keep the therapy going forward in the 

637
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:26,820
face of the tremendous amount of threat.

638
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:27,683
Because you need,
you need something that you didn't 

639
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:35,070
already have to overcome the threats 
that you couldn't cope with before.

640
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,410
And then you would presume that,
well,

641
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,253
once he died in the dream,
that meant that the thing that the 

642
00:36:41,671 --> 00:36:45,360
therapist thought he was had been 
[inaudible],

643
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,033
so to speak,
into the person so the person knew what 

644
00:36:48,781 --> 00:36:51,080
they had put out there was actually an 
attribute themselves,

645
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,810
but know them personally,
but of humanity in general,

646
00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:00,080
when he's in front of a therapist,
provides a story and the therapist would

647
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,333
be story in there for the king and the 
hearing process would result in the 

648
00:37:06,271 --> 00:37:07,104
death of the king as being the,
the crush story followed by the 

649
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,460
possibility of taking on the role,
the crunch store.

650
00:37:15,461 --> 00:37:18,510
You mean to get to get you through the 
story just provides.

651
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:19,520
Yes.
So initially,

652
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,090
yes.
Yeah,

653
00:37:21,091 --> 00:37:21,924
that's right.
Well that's so the dreams is a 

654
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,860
representation story of the consulting 
firm.

655
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,380
Bain,
right?

656
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,760
Right.
Exactly.

657
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,160
Speaking of which,
I'm going to.

658
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,760
I'm going to show you some images.
It's better to show this in images.

659
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:37,370
So you guys can read the manuscript and 
you can add like,

660
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,363
I'll answer your questions too.
I want to show you this one in 

661
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:41,910
particular just so you can keep it in 
mind.

662
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,070
This is an image of the positive 
feminine,

663
00:37:44,071 --> 00:37:45,690
by the way.
Green Tara from that.

664
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,310
This is what,
sorry.

665
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:49,680
That's not very focused.
This is a Mandela.

666
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,400
You have to take my word for it.
Seeing from the side instead of from the

667
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:55,350
top,
usually go to Mandela is.

668
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:56,970
It's a square that has a circle 
inscribed.

669
00:37:56,971 --> 00:37:59,360
It's divided into four parts.
You see them in wallpaper and on.

670
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:01,440
Unranked isn't all over the place 
anyways.

671
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:04,370
This is one that if you look from the 
top,

672
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,250
it would be a man.
Now you can see the square here,

673
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,163
circle there.

674
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,610
Anyways,
that's Tara.

675
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,730
She's a positive image of the feminine.
She's in this thing of in here.

676
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,730
That's trees.
It doesn't matter.

677
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,033
I love.
The thing that's interesting about that 

678
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:23,720
is that there's a whole creation myth 
and this little in this little lot,

679
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,700
this little statue,
that's a turtle.

680
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,540
The turtle on which there are threats.
Out of that comes these two dragons.

681
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,473
We should know a little bit about.
You should be able to see how that 

682
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,210
relates to creation mythology,
but anyway,

683
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:38,044
she pops out at the end.
She's an image of higher consciousness 

684
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:43,480
as well.
Anyways,

685
00:38:43,481 --> 00:38:46,320
the thing or what did he keep in mind is
keys to certain to certain,

686
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,223
like things that accompany your.
I want to show you some Disney 

687
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:50,370
animation.
Great.

688
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:55,120
Now I'm Mrs Partly Dancer for to address
your question in part.

689
00:38:55,121 --> 00:38:56,940
I mean you said,
you know,

690
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,800
did these images pop up or they 
transmitted?

691
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,110
I don't have a clue,
but I'll show you some of them.

692
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,010
This is a really funny one.
This is from the rescuers.

693
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,773
This horrible female gets this little 
girl out of the orphanage and she wants 

694
00:39:15,071 --> 00:39:15,904
to lower down a well and in the whale 
there's diamond in a skull which has no 

695
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:25,891
chemical image by the way.
She lives in a swamp in a row boat.

696
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,223
The swamp is.
That is a favorite place for creatures 

697
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:32,854
of the night in fairy tales and myths 
and that's because the swamp is a place 

698
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,570
where death is transformed into life.
Straight.

699
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:41,620
Swamp is eerie because things are dying 
rocking here all the time,

700
00:39:41,621 --> 00:39:43,690
but it's also a place where there's a 
lot of action.

701
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,540
So anyways,
she's in the swamp.

702
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,780
I'm going to show you a very short brief
on this.

703
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,380
This is more comical than anything else,
but

704
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,260
okay.
All these little avenues.

705
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,140
Okay.
This is where the horrible.

706
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:27,570
If you would try to
give me my KDP or

707
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:39,060
teddy goes with me.
Those were her values.

708
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:45,580
Hmm.
Just do your whole list

709
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:01,620
on the steering wheel.
No hurry.

710
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:16,630
Girls and boys that have a real life
character with this creature

711
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,653
anyways,

712
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,120
and so she plays the role to here,
so to speak,

713
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,170
which basically means when a human being
is in its infancy,

714
00:43:40,171 --> 00:43:41,620
he has her,
her infancy there,

715
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,910
obviously very,
very vulnerable to all sorts of external

716
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,470
forces.
So that's,

717
00:43:46,471 --> 00:43:48,570
that's basically all that's making 
reference to.

718
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,060
You see this pop up in all sorts of 
weird ways.

719
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:53,020
Superman in the car.
The comment,

720
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,720
by the way,
that became very,

721
00:43:54,721 --> 00:43:59,721
very popular during the depression and 
Superman's birth was endangered,

722
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:03,110
right?
His planet was going to blow up and uh,

723
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:06,090
he crashed earth and have two sets of 
parents as well.

724
00:44:06,091 --> 00:44:09,250
He has the cans who has normal parents 
and jewelry.

725
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,093
Hell and all.
Who are his celestial parents and he's 

726
00:44:12,931 --> 00:44:13,411
a.
well,

727
00:44:13,411 --> 00:44:16,400
he's a hero obviously.
Andy,

728
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:17,923
what's that?
I don't know the story of Orphan Annie 

729
00:44:20,461 --> 00:44:22,830
very well.
She has.

730
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,600
She's an from the dingy as daddy 
warbucks.

731
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:25,620
Oh yes,
that's right.

732
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,430
That's right.
Yeah.

733
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,440
That's very typical.
That's pretty typical.

734
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:32,460
So that's making reference to the 
parents by the way,

735
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,950
and the divine parents from the 
mythological perspective,

736
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,490
our culture,
that's the masculine domain in nature.

737
00:44:38,491 --> 00:44:42,420
That's the feminine domain.
Or You could say the predictable hip and

738
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,320
unknown.
Those.

739
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,273
Those are the two things that give birth
to the hero and the hero is the symbol 

740
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:51,950
of wealth is one of the symbols of the 
individual human being.

741
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,940
The fight over the teddy bear seemed 
like with the diamond inside seemed like

742
00:44:56,941 --> 00:45:01,650
the sun bug or a newman talks about in 
here.

743
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,380
Is that.
Am I getting too far gone?

744
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:04,901
No,
no,

745
00:45:04,901 --> 00:45:05,550
no,
no.

746
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:07,530
I didn't pay much attention to the 
jewel.

747
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:08,543
The jewel plays a big role in here 
because the jewels in the little teddy 

748
00:45:10,381 --> 00:45:13,320
bear that's hers.
And the fight over that.

749
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,520
Yeah.
Well it's,

750
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:15,363
it's,
it's funny because you see the girl 

751
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:17,964
winds who.

752
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,300
Let me see if I can remember the story 
properly.

753
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,030
Um,
like I said,

754
00:45:24,031 --> 00:45:26,340
the girl has to go into a dark.
Well to get this diamond,

755
00:45:26,341 --> 00:45:27,174
it's inside the skull,
so she has to recover fears to get it 

756
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:31,710
and she's getting it for this horrible 
woman.

757
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:32,544
Now the woman has the diamond confused 
with what it represents and that's why 

758
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:35,874
she's after that.
So this is a parable about materialism 

759
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:40,620
by the way,
that's when you get the diamond confused

760
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:41,454
with what it represents.
The little girl actually wins the 

761
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:44,550
diamond,
so to speak,

762
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:47,430
because she overcomes the great mother 
and at the end of the second,

763
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:49,470
of course the story that's happening 
because she's a hero.

764
00:45:49,471 --> 00:45:52,470
She does end up with a family.
She's turned into a real person.

765
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,560
That's basically,
that's basically the moral of the story.

766
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:57,540
So,
and on that note,

767
00:45:57,541 --> 00:45:58,620
let me show you this one.

768
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:00,870
Okay.
This is Pinocchio.

769
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,330
And Nokia is a hero myth.
I mean it's,

770
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,513
it's,
it has all the elements of the hero 

771
00:46:06,481 --> 00:46:07,314
myth.
The Nokia was not real at the beginning 

772
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,980
of the story is made out of what will.
Blue fairy comes down and says,

773
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:12,570
if you're good,
if you're good,

774
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,730
you can become a real,
a real boy.

775
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:16,103
And uh,
so then he goes on a series of 

776
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:21,740
adventures and the adventures culminate 
in this scene and he,

777
00:46:21,741 --> 00:46:25,060
he's accompanied by this cricket given 
crickets.

778
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:28,170
Who's a,
that's his conscience.

779
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,370
He plays the same role,
you know,

780
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:30,223
this little cartoon face scenes you see 
where there's an angel on one shoulder 

781
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:33,540
and a devil on the other.
Well,

782
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:37,230
Jimminy cricket is the angelic aspect of
conscience and I've always,

783
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,100
I don't know,
like,

784
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,680
I don't know this and this is just 
something that popped into my,

785
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:41,843
my,
uh,

786
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:43,463
my imagination,
but his initials are jc and I don't 

787
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:49,440
think that's a flute
anyways.

788
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:52,531
Okay.
So,

789
00:46:52,531 --> 00:46:53,280
uh,

790
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,080
he's fallen in with bad company.
Okay.

791
00:46:55,081 --> 00:46:55,914
On his adventure.
He's out in the world and it's just 

792
00:47:00,061 --> 00:47:00,894
checking.

793
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:16,721
Okay,
well,

794
00:47:16,721 --> 00:47:21,720
you get the picture there.
That's where he's almost identical story

795
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:26,530
of the horse and the cirrus.
And why that's the case.

796
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:29,620
I don't know the history of this 
particular story.

797
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:33,310
Um,
I want to show you just a couple of

798
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,440
overheads here.
The Fisher King,

799
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:44,043
right?

800
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,940
Just one other comment,
this is the edited version,

801
00:47:47,941 --> 00:47:51,180
the 19 eighties version,
and the original Disney version.

802
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,910
When they were inside the belly of the 
beast,

803
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,790
they they decided they were going to eat
the fish,

804
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,080
the little fish,
Cleo,

805
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,720
to stay alive,
and that was edited out.

806
00:48:00,721 --> 00:48:03,570
That might have some sacrificial.

807
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:04,771
Well,
I don't know.

808
00:48:04,771 --> 00:48:07,010
I didn't know that.
I didn't know that.

809
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:15,330
That's an interesting image that's
relevant

810
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:24,520
in the jaws of hell,
so detail,

811
00:48:24,521 --> 00:48:29,521
but wouldn't acquire stolen friends
anyways,

812
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:37,260
so that's kind of interesting.
Relevant image,

813
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:43,750
these
images.

814
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:49,910
Sixth Century.
That's the cauldron of transformation by

815
00:48:50,071 --> 00:48:53,970
the way,
that the blue angel therapy and that was

816
00:48:53,971 --> 00:48:56,610
a.
she's a symbol of the positive aspect of

817
00:48:56,611 --> 00:48:58,970
the feminine.
No positive aspect of novelty.

818
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,813
Basically it was released as a 
consequence of his voluntary represents 

819
00:49:04,081 --> 00:49:04,914
the dragon.
Remember Marta curves the world of 

820
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:08,700
timeout.
Timeouts.

821
00:49:08,701 --> 00:49:10,740
This dragon that lives at the bottom of 
the ocean.

822
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,640
Same thing happens in the Hebrew Bible 
to it's varied.

823
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:17,010
It refers to a much more archaic 
tradition.

824
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:18,103
You have a three makes the world out of 
it as a consequence of dabbled with the 

825
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:24,510
monster that's variously known as ray 
habit and Leviathan.

826
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:29,550
How if I have the hair of this section 
is written down,

827
00:49:29,551 --> 00:49:30,384
but my computer crashed today and I 
didn't bring them in so I can get you 

828
00:49:33,391 --> 00:49:37,500
the references if you want for 
references and various places

829
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,870
in the old testament while there's some 
mostly in the old testament.

830
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,690
Yeah.
It's also the case.

831
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:50,100
This is interesting too,
is when Jehovah threatens to lay various

832
00:49:50,101 --> 00:49:51,210
territories,
waste,

833
00:49:51,211 --> 00:49:53,670
which he does with certain mode of 
regularity,

834
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,833
he always describes the territory that 
will remain after everything's 

835
00:49:57,121 --> 00:50:00,000
devastated as fit habitation for 
serpents.

836
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:01,653
So again,
it starts the story of the reduction of 

837
00:50:03,641 --> 00:50:08,280
the order flakes.
Chaos and chaos is the place that's fit,

838
00:50:08,281 --> 00:50:12,540
habitation for surface and anything that
lives there is assimilated to a circle.

839
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:17,400
So I'll get you the quotes.
I collected them all last two weeks ago.

840
00:50:17,401 --> 00:50:20,130
Actually,
I have the King James Bible on CD role,

841
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,383
which is really useful because you just 
put in whatever your word is and it 

842
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:26,730
gives you every single reference to the 
whole text,

843
00:50:26,731 --> 00:50:29,180
so there's.
Well,

844
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:30,223
he collected a whole sequence of 
references from various cultures that 

845
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:38,660
will bring them in and show you,
so this is an interest in

846
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:46,930
reverification of the sacrifice ram

847
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:56,070
baptism imagery.
That was what Pinocchio,

848
00:50:56,071 --> 00:50:57,660
just on your way and the fact that you 
can say,

849
00:50:57,661 --> 00:51:00,630
well back.
The baptism rituals we have now,

850
00:51:00,631 --> 00:51:02,670
which are pretty trivial Christian ones 
anyways,

851
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,513
a pretty jovial,
so in some some sex in the southern us 

852
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:10,170
in particular dip people completely into
the intuit river,

853
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:13,950
signifying your second birth,
generally just sprinkled with water,

854
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:15,263
but what that is is a very.
It's a remnant from a ritual that was 

855
00:51:20,221 --> 00:51:21,054
much harder,
much more dramatic that his finger went 

856
00:51:24,901 --> 00:51:27,780
through in the Disney cartoon by two 
year old son.

857
00:51:27,781 --> 00:51:28,650
Watched that.
By the way,

858
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,493
he was quite impressed with that.
We'll be talking about that for a good 

859
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:34,343
long time.
He started out about a month and a half 

860
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:39,900
ago and he still talks about that.
We'll set the bottom of the ocean.

861
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:45,190
It was pretty impressive.
So I can remember too from from bio,

862
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,810
he chose the image of the inside of the 
whale.

863
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,230
It's almost like a cathedral that stuck 
with me,

864
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,880
if I can remember that when I watched 
this.

865
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:59,090
So that's the second rebirth.
That's voluntary.

866
00:51:59,091 --> 00:52:00,950
Hey,
that's the reason that Nokia was turning

867
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:01,784
into a boy when you hit,
when he was well on his way to becoming 

868
00:52:04,891 --> 00:52:07,410
a jackass was because he decided 
voluntarily,

869
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,290
first of all,
to jump into the ocean and the ocean.

870
00:52:10,291 --> 00:52:13,860
That's another symbol of the chaos that 
sort of precedes creation.

871
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,680
He is a great symbol.
I mean that is where life came from.

872
00:52:16,681 --> 00:52:19,170
After all.
Here's one from Peru,

873
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,753
dragon fight heroes there.
There's the dragons got fish like 

874
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:29,030
features here as well.
Human Nature.

875
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:40,060
Yeah.
The respirators.

876
00:52:40,061 --> 00:52:41,110
Why did they,
why were,

877
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,800
why were there two alligators?
And also the,

878
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:44,960
uh,
the

879
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:47,970
reference to,
to is,

880
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,013
is the reference.
It's a reference to the world parents 

881
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:54,640
set.
The serpent separates into two things,

882
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,310
order in chaos.
I don't exactly.

883
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,160
That's about the best I can give to that
stuff.

884
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,083
The negative mother often appears 
associated with a serpent time for mass 

885
00:53:06,101 --> 00:53:07,810
because as I said,
as far as I can tell,

886
00:53:07,811 --> 00:53:10,990
I've been trying to puzzle this time.
It's because the.

887
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,753
It's not that easy,
easy to distinguish the chaos that 

888
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:18,880
existed opposition from order to the 
chaos that proceeds over the division of

889
00:53:18,881 --> 00:53:21,220
order and chaos again,
they get mixed together.

890
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:22,570
Okay,
cool.

891
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:23,271
Yeah,
that's a great.

892
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:24,104
That's a great time.
That's a great picture on the night 

893
00:53:27,511 --> 00:53:28,344
scene journey.
So he's assimilated to the sun because 

894
00:53:30,181 --> 00:53:32,810
it's the son that goes through the night
seizure every office.

895
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:34,080
By the way,
the myth of system.

896
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:34,933
This is all being assimilated to the sun
and you remember that diagram I showed 

897
00:53:38,551 --> 00:53:39,384
you.
Things descending into chaos and then 

898
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,670
being reborn.
Well,

899
00:53:41,671 --> 00:53:43,980
that's a solar imagery as well.
Anyways,

900
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,530
this is a great emergency.
Okay,

901
00:53:46,531 --> 00:53:48,450
so he's out there in the night in this 
cauldron.

902
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:52,790
He's wearing the skin of a line or lines
of solar beast for all these reasons.

903
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,600
It's yellow.
It's in Africa called or study.

904
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:00,900
It's sort of upstarting,
typical masculine characteristics.

905
00:54:00,901 --> 00:54:01,734
Even though it turns out that it's 
female lines to actually do most of the 

906
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,990
other thing,
in reality,

907
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:08,550
he's carrying a club,
right?

908
00:54:08,551 --> 00:54:10,660
That's his weapon.
His eyes were very wide open.

909
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:11,543
He's conscious,
fully coded signals was doing see the 

910
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,970
club,
these things on the club.

911
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:15,863
Those are our eyes.
So it's more for symbolism of 

912
00:54:20,821 --> 00:54:25,170
consciousness.
So he's up to defeat the monster that it

913
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,033
inhabits.
Unexplored territory territory before 

914
00:54:27,841 --> 00:54:31,770
it's being transformed into the place 
where real human beings can live.

915
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:34,530
So.
Okay,

916
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,230
let me show you some others.
So we looked at the rescuers,

917
00:54:37,231 --> 00:54:39,230
right?
Yes.

918
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:49,350
But then he rides from.
He was from Australia,

919
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,580
you know,
it gives kind of scary.

920
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,200
So by that time it's more or less 
inevitable.

921
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:58,890
So yeah,
he tries to give it away so it's funny.

922
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:01,080
So I don't know what to make of that.
Exactly.

923
00:55:01,081 --> 00:55:03,180
Accepted by that time.
It's too late to turn back.

924
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:04,973
It's funny too because his conscience is
more or less warning them against the 

925
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,410
Jenny Craig is warning them against 
doing it,

926
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:15,030
but it also helps them tie the state.
It was a real cute touch.

927
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:17,530
So let's see.
So we have,

928
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:18,683
well,

929
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:22,643
well maybe we'll do this one.
Some of you have seen the sleeping 

930
00:55:25,201 --> 00:55:26,250
beauty clip.
I used it,

931
00:55:26,251 --> 00:55:29,090
my personality class,
so we'll do the little mermaid instead.

932
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:35,310
So you can see the assimilation of the 
feminine character.

933
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,333
Okay.
Now

934
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:42,660
Ariel wants to become a real human 
being.

935
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:47,930
Same sort of same time.
She's also a like to to surface.

936
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:54,700
They're not hurt their personally
eels.

937
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:58,620
Look at the structure she goes into.
This is very interesting.

938
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:03,720
It's a portal portal.
Imagery defines the border between chaos

939
00:56:03,721 --> 00:56:04,554
and order.
That's another reason why the feminine 

940
00:56:06,091 --> 00:56:10,980
is often used to symbolize the chaos 
because the female is the border between

941
00:56:10,981 --> 00:56:13,590
the place that creation takes place and 
the real world.

942
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:16,500
That's the most fundamental reason of 
heroes.

943
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:20,080
Often climate in the body,
the value of the feminine,

944
00:56:20,081 --> 00:56:21,240
the Feminine Needs.

945
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,170
Okay,
so

946
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:30,280
those are soils that the negative mother
was gone.

947
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:44,540
I'll
just be in social personality

948
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:50,933
disorder.

949
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:54,143
The same thing happen to them as 
happened to the boys that were turned 

950
00:56:55,961 --> 00:57:00,961
into donkey says
they've made errors.

951
00:57:01,291 --> 00:57:02,200
These choices

952
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,670
is the fitting room.

953
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:11,823
I'm gonna stop this for a minute.
One of our students last year asked me 

954
00:57:14,561 --> 00:57:15,394
why ask me some questions about these 
negative feminine new images and why 

955
00:57:19,571 --> 00:57:24,140
they were often sexual,
especially in Disney movies then occurs.

956
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:26,430
They're very concerned with beauty.
For example though,

957
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,090
she's.
She's kind of grotesque,

958
00:57:28,091 --> 00:57:32,950
but figure out a snow white's mother,
which is sleeping,

959
00:57:32,951 --> 00:57:33,784
but they're usually older child the 
swimming and I read that as a symbol of 

960
00:57:38,531 --> 00:57:42,490
the sacrifice of the child to the 
maintenance of youthful.

961
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:46,440
That's what childless,
that's what child listens.

962
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:50,110
Representative needs in these stories.
So for example,

963
00:57:50,111 --> 00:57:50,944
Snow White's mother,
very concerned that she's the most 

964
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:54,580
beautiful.
She's the stepmother.

965
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,500
She's never,
she's never.

966
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:59,920
She's never had children and the way 
that myth dot reeves,

967
00:57:59,921 --> 00:58:00,754
that basically as far as I can tell us 
that that's equivalent to the devouring 

968
00:58:04,121 --> 00:58:06,660
of children who sacrifice of children 
to.

969
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:08,620
But.
And that's what makes these fingers sort

970
00:58:08,621 --> 00:58:11,830
of both beautiful and and horrifying at 
the same time.

971
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:15,670
They're attempting to hold on to a 
domain that's,

972
00:58:15,671 --> 00:58:20,671
I guess not right there.
Yeah.

973
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:32,790
She's,
she's clearly assimilated to conserve.

974
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:36,890
That becomes even more clear later time.
So she's going to,

975
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:38,550
she's offering area of bargains.

976
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:49,100
What
I do,

977
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:57,940
unfortunately have
no one else did

978
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:08,030
in the past
when they called me.

979
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:13,100
Well,
nowadays I've mended all my ways.

980
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:18,270
Repentance,
which is handy.

981
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I always have to say
I use it on behalf of the

982
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:40,580
state,
wants to get the girl and do

983
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:49,423
so
now it's happened once or twice the 

984
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:07,880
price and I'm afraid I have to
put all the whole life of

985
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:23,630
a human
for three days.

986
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:32,380
Three days.
You get derailed.

987
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:43,510
He's got to kiss,
kiss,

988
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:48,810
kiss,
kiss you.

989
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:55,840
You remain human,
but it doesn't

990
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:05,320
give
you

991
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:18,530
a
choice.

992
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:29,730
Oh,
we haven't discussed this.

993
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:44,270
This is
what I bought from your way is

994
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:52,450
sweet cakes.
No more talking,

995
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:56,090
singing
voice,

996
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:04,090
and don't
get fired

997
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:16,010
for ladies,
not to say a word on that.

998
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:28,920
He
was withdrawn and she.

999
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:37,140
Oh
bosses.

1000
01:03:24,350 --> 01:03:29,350
She's.
The funny thing about this movie is this

1001
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:34,000
know she's pretty horrible character,
but it is.

1002
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:35,883
It is because of her in the middle 
assists that Ariel does get what she 

1003
01:03:38,591 --> 01:03:43,591
wants.
She wants to.

1004
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:46,360
She wants to be human.
So

1005
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:49,040
I mean,
what would you.

1006
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,960
What does that mean?
Well,

1007
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:52,140
she's,
she's not really.

1008
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:54,910
She's a subterranean creatures.
He doesn't

1009
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:59,810
know what the equivalent is for being in
the ocean.

1010
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:02,390
She's not real,
so she's.

1011
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:05,140
She wants to be transformed into 
actuality.

1012
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:05,993
I guess just going to know
what does it seem like she has to 

1013
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,330
sacrifice something to get what she 
wants.

1014
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:13,433
Well,
because you have to sacrifice something 

1015
01:04:14,511 --> 01:04:19,511
to get you.
That's.

1016
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:23,360
That's the sacrificial motif in part 
there.

1017
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:24,900
I mean,
that's the thing she values most,

1018
01:04:24,901 --> 01:04:27,790
right?
Is their voice in this particular.

1019
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:32,990
In this particular scene,
walking,

1020
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:36,890
walking legs,
is that each step?

1021
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Does she get her voice back?
Yeah.

1022
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:10,743
It's hard for me to tell exactly where 
to start this because of this machine 

1023
01:05:13,811 --> 01:05:18,120
doesn't have any place.
You have

1024
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:23,260
to
make

1025
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:36,150
some
pretty serious boats.

1026
01:05:47,180 --> 01:05:52,180
Married the wrong woman
because she has Ariel's voice.

1027
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:56,790
Why don't you just watch
the sun set?

1028
01:05:56,810 --> 01:05:58,360
Remember that's her domain,
right?

1029
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:03,390
Because she's the creature that eats the
sun.

1030
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:20,440
Some dogs are
very precious

1031
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:27,770
exchange.
Someone

1032
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:33,760
lost her.
Once

1033
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:37,863
again,

1034
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:15,390
monster bites the dust.
No,

1035
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:19,440
the king is released.
Again,

1036
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:23,520
this is typically goes into the belly of
the beast.

1037
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:24,653
He freeze.
Those people were there and basically 

1038
01:12:26,791 --> 01:12:27,624
what that means is that he's established
a new pattern of behavior or an 

1039
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:32,153
adaptation or a new frame of reference 
that enabled people will be defeated by 

1040
01:12:36,031 --> 01:12:36,864
the unknown,
threatening I know to well to start 

1041
01:12:41,221 --> 01:12:42,054
their life again,
because you have to remember that the 

1042
01:12:45,271 --> 01:12:46,104
nature of the unknown,
which is to say the nature of your 

1043
01:12:48,661 --> 01:12:53,170
experience
is absolutely dependent on how you are.

1044
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,030
Okay,
well,

1045
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:59,940
I'll lead to the age of 63,
12,

1046
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:01,260
3:00.
Um,

1047
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:05,400
I wanted to show you all those things so
that when you go through the next couple

1048
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,233
of chapters,
you're sort of building up a storehouse 

1049
01:13:07,561 --> 01:13:08,394
of images too,
because the only way you can understand 

1050
01:13:09,511 --> 01:13:13,140
this stuff is to
get the images down basically.

1051
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:18,720
So you're also reading a great mother 
right now.

1052
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,730
See,
this is a union vote.

1053
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:25,930
Fundamentally,
our students both young and none of them

1054
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:26,773
believed that the great mother was a 
representation of the collective 

1055
01:13:29,341 --> 01:13:32,610
unconscious.
I think they're wrong in a sense.

1056
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:34,980
It's a great mother,
is a representation of novelty,

1057
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:36,533
is just so happens that the phenomena 
that young subsumed under the rubric of 

1058
01:13:39,571 --> 01:13:42,750
the collective unconscious are the,
you could say,

1059
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:43,584
or the first r is the first line of 
defense that people erect against the 

1060
01:13:48,271 --> 01:13:49,104
unknown,
which is basically to say that if 

1061
01:13:50,341 --> 01:13:54,540
something unexpected happens,
you start imagining what it might be.

1062
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,033
So the imagination,
what we would normally refer to as the 

1063
01:13:59,041 --> 01:14:01,250
imagination,
its constituent elements.

1064
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:04,350
That's what you identified as the 
collective unconscious.

1065
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:09,330
So all I'm saying basically is that if 
something unexpected happened to you,

1066
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:14,020
it always occurs into some form of 
representation.

1067
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:15,703
So,
and it's that form of representation 

1068
01:14:17,891 --> 01:14:20,320
that you identified as the collective 
unconscious.

1069
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:25,270
So he would say novelty as such,
would adopt the aspect of Kelly,

1070
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:26,133
for example.

1071
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:40,040
Anyways,
I think that the book makes more sense.

1072
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:44,270
The theory makes more sense in general,
if you understand the great mothers,

1073
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:45,143
the archetype of novelty,
unknown territory behind your sits the 

1074
01:14:50,211 --> 01:14:52,660
dragon.
So that's true.

1075
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:53,420
Uh,
yeah.

1076
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:58,420
I just was looking in the book the other
the other day and I saw the euro burst.

1077
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:02,690
Describe as a representation of 
consciousness.

1078
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:03,953
How do you think that that is?
Because the consciousness comes out of 

1079
01:15:06,771 --> 01:15:08,040
the finger that.
Well,

1080
01:15:08,190 --> 01:15:12,160
the thing is the reverse is the source 
of the subject and it's not.

1081
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,780
It's not a symbol for consciousness per 
se.

1082
01:15:14,781 --> 01:15:17,060
It's a symbol for the origins of 
consciousness.

1083
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,360
The place that it comes from,
you know,

1084
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,233
I was just looking through.
His book is called the Silverware 

1085
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:24,013
University,
but well people take liberties with the 

1086
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:27,363
symbols.
That's the problem is that they do tend 

1087
01:15:28,701 --> 01:15:29,534
to.
They do tend to mail and across 

1088
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,273
categories.
It's not because they have fuzzy 

1089
01:15:33,261 --> 01:15:35,420
borders.
They do tend to blend into one another.

1090
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,610
Not knowing anything else about the 
book.

1091
01:15:40,611 --> 01:15:41,444
I wouldn't say that the statement that 
the of burroughs is the symbol for 

1092
01:15:43,521 --> 01:15:44,750
consciousness is wrong.

1093
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:48,370
It's
so

1094
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:55,110
what's
the father representing consciousness.

1095
01:15:57,050 --> 01:15:58,220
Okay.
Just for the record,

1096
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,760
before the represents,
there's.

1097
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:04,670
There's two domains of masculine 
symbolism and mythology.

1098
01:16:04,671 --> 01:16:09,230
Once the hero wins the father,
before that gives rise to the hero,

1099
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,510
which is to say that you're a product of
your culture,

1100
01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:13,760
but the hearing also gives rise to the 
farther,

1101
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:14,653
which is to say that culture is a 
product of the activity of the 

1102
01:16:16,971 --> 01:16:20,300
individual.
So in Pinocchio,

1103
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:22,670
I would still say that Japan was 
assembled,

1104
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:25,003
symbolize more what we would consider 
the domain of the state or culture and 

1105
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:31,200
Nokia with the forest that revivified

1106
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:32,880
yeah,
for Jimminy cricket.

1107
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:36,723
And
so it's kind of like consciousness is 

1108
01:16:41,941 --> 01:16:42,774
referring to
save his consciousness and what he's 

1109
01:16:47,431 --> 01:16:48,264
doing.
He referred to him as the son in the 

1110
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:53,163
movie.

1111
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:56,000
He's not.
No.

1112
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:56,630
Oh,
I see.

1113
01:16:56,630 --> 01:16:58,760
No,
he's not saving his consciousness to see

1114
01:16:58,761 --> 01:17:01,760
Japan and notion tells him to save 
themselves.

1115
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:05,720
So like Pinocchio takes the more 
difficult route,

1116
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:06,554
which is the simultaneous,
I would say from a mythological 

1117
01:17:08,661 --> 01:17:09,494
perspective,
the simultaneous regeneration of 

1118
01:17:11,271 --> 01:17:12,104
culture.
So what are the things that you all 

1119
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:14,983
pointed out?
Was there any personal problem that's 

1120
01:17:17,241 --> 01:17:18,074
taken far enough in terms of cultural 
problem and if you do a thorough job of 

1121
01:17:21,921 --> 01:17:25,820
solving your personal problem because 
many people share that problem with you.

1122
01:17:25,821 --> 01:17:26,654
I mean it's very rare that you'll have a
broad mix you so unique to you that 

1123
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:30,083
doesn't also affect that whole a whole 
sequence of people who live at the same 

1124
01:17:33,921 --> 01:17:34,754
time as you do.
If you really solved that problem 

1125
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,633
symbol,
fantasy or update your culture and 

1126
01:17:39,291 --> 01:17:42,110
that's what that was.
That's what that story was referring to.

1127
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:42,973
That's why.
See,

1128
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:48,080
that was a sufficiently heroic endeavor.
So the Pinocchio got awarded by becoming

1129
01:17:48,081 --> 01:17:48,914
real.
He didn't just do the thing that was 

1130
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:52,213
best for himself in the narrow sense.
He also did the thing that revivified 

1131
01:17:55,670 --> 01:17:56,503
his father.
The thing that made him like literally 

1132
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,020
an obedient because he was made out of 
wood better was a master craftsman.

1133
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:05,070
So Japan,
Oh,

1134
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:08,710
stands for accumulated wisdom basically 
that,

1135
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:09,833
that,
that can become stultified but is 

1136
01:18:12,981 --> 01:18:15,470
nonetheless necessary to sort of drag 
along,

1137
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:18,410
so to speak.
So it depended on the positive aspect of

1138
01:18:18,411 --> 01:18:19,790
the known.
Yeah.

1139
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:21,290
And the in that particular.
That's right.

1140
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:24,200
He's the guy who forgot,
I can't remember his name,

1141
01:18:24,201 --> 01:18:29,200
but the one who ran the pleasure alum or
the boys that the negative aspects.

1142
01:18:29,201 --> 01:18:30,040
That's right.
That's right.

1143
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:33,320
See a name that the boys who misbehave,
who didn't follow,

1144
01:18:33,321 --> 01:18:37,010
the coaches who were abandoned by their 
conscious never no longer spoke to them.

1145
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:39,860
They were transformative to jackasses 
and became slaves.

1146
01:18:39,861 --> 01:18:42,670
That's right.
He was the negative aspect of culture.

1147
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:48,680
So the euro is transformed by flooding.
I mean they're both transformed,

1148
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:50,650
right?
While to hear.

1149
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:54,020
Exactly.
It's a process of mutual transformation.

1150
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:57,780
You see in the Cirrus Horace Smith,
which is the myth that IED,

1151
01:18:57,860 --> 01:18:58,693
the Egyptian Pharaoh for Onyx stape was 
predicated on is the pharaoh is both 

1152
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:07,220
Osiris and horus simultaneously,
and that's because the pharaoh,

1153
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:08,143
if like the Dan Pharaoh,
the pharaoh just died instantly 

1154
01:19:10,521 --> 01:19:13,910
assimilated to ocirus,
but the live feral,

1155
01:19:13,911 --> 01:19:16,310
that's horace.
He's both though horace and ocirus.

1156
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:17,780
Simultaneously I take,
well,

1157
01:19:17,781 --> 01:19:19,980
that's confusing.
Is the dead pharaohs ocirus.

1158
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:22,250
How can the live feral deal?
Sarah Sound Horace,

1159
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:24,950
but those cirrus is the wisdom of the 
past,

1160
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,113
and horace is the process that faces the
unknown and constantly updates the 

1161
01:19:30,471 --> 01:19:31,304
wisdom of the past and both of those 
together make the Pharaoh and that 

1162
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,090
that's right.

1163
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:35,923
I mean the Egyptians had it right.
If there's an act that the state is an 

1164
01:19:38,961 --> 01:19:39,794
active process,
plus the accumulation of knowledge and 

1165
01:19:43,161 --> 01:19:46,370
the process is adaptation in the face of
the unknown,

1166
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:47,503
adaptation to the unknown,
and that was symbolized by these 

1167
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:50,534
monsters,
that key necessary monsters that keep 

1168
01:19:53,721 --> 01:19:56,330
popping up for the law and these stories
that we looked at today.

1169
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:59,750
Who is the nicest
mean?

1170
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:00,720
Who?
What does she?

1171
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,860
I can't remember her.
She probably just don't remember what it

1172
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:04,591
is.
Oh,

1173
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:07,490
well,
she's the one who reassembles cirrus.

1174
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,040
Once he's cut apart,
I think if I remember correctly,

1175
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:14,130
said seth capsule,
but Warner was conflict with seth,

1176
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:20,070
but isis scatters up his pieces.
So she's a,

1177
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:21,840
she's an image of the closet and 
feminine.

1178
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,030
I don't remember her developmental 
history.

1179
01:20:24,031 --> 01:20:25,530
I don't remember who she is.
Assimilated.

1180
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:32,540
So she's an aspect.
Yes.

1181
01:20:37,431 --> 01:20:40,820
Isis is.
Isis is

1182
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:45,600
another.
Right?

1183
01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:47,643
Right.
