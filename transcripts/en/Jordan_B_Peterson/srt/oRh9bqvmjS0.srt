1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,500
You know,
Adam Russell brand with doctor,

2
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:03,334
professor Dr to Professor Julian ps,
and you've got to join us and watch and 

3
00:00:07,211 --> 00:00:09,310
listen to under the skin.
What did we talk about?

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,830
Oh God,
it was deep.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,550
Was everything under the sun?
Yeah.

6
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,181
Yeah.
You're,

7
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:15,730
you're an exhausting interviewer in the 
best possible.

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,320
We really,
really enjoyed it.

9
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:19,510
I think it was a good open conversation.
I think we,

10
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,810
we went through a lot topics such as we 
talked about there,

11
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,693
uh,
controversies that you've been involved 

12
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:26,590
with.
Even some of my control vcs,

13
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,200
if you enjoy it.
We talked about inequality.

14
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,110
We told her that in American attorneys.
You talked about politics,

15
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,120
how the temperament means,
what words mean where power lies.

16
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:38,130
I mean,
it's pretty good conversation.

17
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,010
We both have got vague headaches.
I feel a bit sort of exhausted.

18
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:43,870
This would probably be the big way we 
would say something stupid.

19
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:47,310
So please listen to under the skin and a
whoa.

20
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,970
Just to be alive,
to be alive.

21
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:51,430
Really.
But one thing you could do,

22
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:54,130
you could do that and to that within the
scope of your freedoms.

23
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,350
Right?
Oh,

24
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,290
thank you.
Thank you.

25
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,250
Thank you very much,
ma'am.

26
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,163
Yeah,
under the skin.
