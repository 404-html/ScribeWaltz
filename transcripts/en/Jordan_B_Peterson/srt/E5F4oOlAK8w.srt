1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
Got It.
So it's a so people are taking it 

2
00:00:02,431 --> 00:00:03,450
seriously.
That's good.

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,000
It's good.
I say that.

4
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:09,360
But you're the one who has to deal with 
the pain and the pressure.

5
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:09,910
So

6
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:10,743
yeah.
Well I'm in a permanent state of being 

7
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:12,850
freaked out,
so

8
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,630
when I woke up this morning with all 
these ideas that I wanted to talk to you

9
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:20,950
about.
All right.

10
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,490
Okay.
So let me pull up the emails that I sent

11
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:25,700
you.
Yeah.

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,390
Okay.
So one of the things,

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,080
did you want to talk first just to,
just to get her ideas to or what maybe I

14
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:40,914
can.
I also want to comment on some of the 

15
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,350
things you wrote.
Go ahead.

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,630
One of the things,
one of the difficulties,

17
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,140
by the way,
are you recording this already?

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,120
Yeah,
well I can always edit it afterwards.

19
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:51,840
Okay.

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,560
Um,
well maybe you should,

21
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,340
maybe you should speak first because 
that way when I talk about the,

22
00:00:58,341 --> 00:00:58,940
the,
the,

23
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,691
the,
the kind of,

24
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:02,480
the questions that I have a,
especially in regard to the cross.

25
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,330
The Cross is really complicated.
It's a complicated.

26
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:10,331
It's like it's meant to be a to be a 
mystery and so the way it's presented to

27
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:12,704
us it,
it kind of breaks all the categories in 

28
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:15,374
a way and so or it unites them together.
You can rather see it that way and so 

29
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:21,190
it's difficult to.
It's difficult to,

30
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:25,400
to talk about the cross because it's 
both totally on the inside,

31
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,323
you know,
it's the center of the world at the 

32
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,670
access of the cosmos.
It's all those things,

33
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,080
but it's also,
you know,

34
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:33,590
at the edge of the world because even in
the story it's brought outside.

35
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:35,930
His crucifixion happens outside of the 
city.

36
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,350
It happens on the mountain of the skull 
and also there's a,

37
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:44,060
there's a verse in the Psalm that says 
that the just will never hang on a cross

38
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,430
and so I will,
will never hang on a tree.

39
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:47,440
It doesn't say cross,
but no,

40
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,770
they're just,
will never hang on a tree.

41
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,713
And so there's a,
there's an area in the cross which is 

42
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:56,210
that Christ is the,
just who's hanging on a tree.

43
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,353
So that's actually one of the reasons 
why Jews have never accepted Christ as 

44
00:01:59,481 --> 00:02:01,420
the Messiah because they can't deal with
the,

45
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,140
the,
the absolute,

46
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,200
uh,
like a paradox of having,

47
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,610
you know,
the,

48
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,330
the,
the perfect man hanging on a tree.

49
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,850
And so it's like how do those two 
things.

50
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:14,900
But,
but for a Christian,

51
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,170
it's really bringing together that the,
the extremes.

52
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,820
You know,
I talked about that before.

53
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:22,010
Well,
I think that Christ really isn't the top

54
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:22,844
of the hierarchy,
but he's really the stretching out of 

55
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,350
the hierarchy from the,
from the top to the bottom.

56
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:28,184
Yeah.

57
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,380
Yep.
Okay.

58
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:30,214
So,
so.

59
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,100
Alright.
So we'll get to that.

60
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,090
All right.
Yeah.

61
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,150
Yeah.
Because I think that's,

62
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,153
that's,
that's an interesting way of 

63
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,380
conceptualizing the potential solution 
to this problem.

64
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,220
Yeah.
Okay.

65
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,420
So Derrick had this concept of 
undecidability,

66
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:50,883
right?
There were these things that existed on 

67
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:54,160
the margins that didn't fit into a 
category system.

68
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,600
Yup.
And

69
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,850
we've talked about that before and now 
it to me to be very much associated with

70
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:03,940
the idea that I developed in maps of 
meaning of anomaly.

71
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,123
The anomalous is the monster and the 
reason the anomalous is the monster is 

72
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:10,414
because there's a very large number of 
things that won't fit into any category 

73
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:15,544
system.
Doesn't matter what the category system 

74
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:17,314
is.
There's the things inside the category 

75
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:20,674
system or the category and there's 
things outside and there's a 

76
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:25,810
multiplicity of the things outside.
Yes.

77
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,003
And so the monster images,
appropriate image to represent that 

78
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,620
because monster is a camera that's made 
up of parts.

79
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,663
Yes,
exactly.

80
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,623
Okay.
And you always have to confront what 

81
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:37,970
stands outside the category system.
Yeah,

82
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,180
and it looks to me like we use our 
Predator a detection and defense systems

83
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,014
as the first defense against that.
The first reaction against that because 

84
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,624
it's,
it's an archetypal reality that there 

85
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:53,200
are things outside the category system.

86
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,470
Yeah.
And it's actually,

87
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,310
I think that in terms of phenomenology,
I would say,

88
00:03:58,850 --> 00:03:59,510
uh,
I don't know,

89
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,343
maybe you can actually,
you can eliminate this in terms of 

90
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,370
evolutionary biology because I'm not an 
expert in that at all,

91
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,990
but it seems that there is both the 
predatory aspect where it's,

92
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:10,490
where the,
the,

93
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,333
the,
the monster or the anomaly is seen as 

94
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,930
something to defeat.
But there's also,

95
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,190
there's also an aspect which is the 
desiring.

96
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,120
Yeah,
right,

97
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,680
right.
Well that's the dragon with the,

98
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,153
with the gold.

99
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,041
Yes.
Or,

100
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,600
or the,
the siren,

101
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,880
the siren.
Noah.

102
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,443
The monster itself.
Like there's something about the siren 

103
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,080
and about the,
um,

104
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,630
the idea of Lilith.
For example,

105
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:36,100
in Jewish mythology,
this notion of like the or the um,

106
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,693
or the,
um,

107
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,860
the incubus,
you know,

108
00:04:39,861 --> 00:04:42,380
the idea of the female demon,
uh,

109
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,393
which lures and brings you out of 
yourself and kind of makes you kind of 

110
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,990
waste your seed.
And in a Christian and religious,

111
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,430
uh,
idea where it says if there's a,

112
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,133
there's something about the outside or 
the foreign or the which elicits a 

113
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,580
desire to move out towards it.
I think you kind of talk about that when

114
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:04,100
you talk about this notion of the snake 
that appears,

115
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,930
let's say about a amongst a group of 
chimpanzees get on one hand.

116
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:09,630
Yes.

117
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,463
Yeah.
That's the fascination of the unknown 

118
00:05:12,151 --> 00:05:16,990
and neuro biologically that's associated
with the positive aspect of exploration.

119
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,580
Yeah.
So that's.

120
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,480
Yeah.
So you,

121
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,323
yeah,
it's a paradoxical situation because if 

122
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:24,070
it's unknown you want to be afraid of it
because it might eat you,

123
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:28,210
but because it contains new information,
let's say you also want to approach it.

124
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,981
Yeah.
And,

125
00:05:28,981 --> 00:05:29,930
and it,
that's really,

126
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:32,880
I think it's important,
especially now in our and like our,

127
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,020
our situation to understand the desiring
aspect.

128
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,003
Good.
Because if you can explain a lot of the 

129
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,190
strange phenomena that,
you know,

130
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,253
the turnaround sexuality in terms of,
of all the strange fetishization of 

131
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,000
sexuality into,
into,

132
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:47,781
uh,
you know,

133
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,040
sometimes it's opposite,
you know,

134
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:49,874
like the weird,
the weird scatological fetishes that 

135
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,084
people have in the strange,
like it's as if there's something about 

136
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,803
the,
the or the monster ious or the 

137
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,080
discarded,
which can also in a certain instance,

138
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:06,070
if people let themselves go,
we'll pull them into a,

139
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:07,970
a desire,
a relationship with that.

140
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:08,973
Well,
one of the things you do find is that 

141
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,770
sexual release like orgasm is 
potentiated by novelty.

142
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,670
So that's a good example of that.
Yeah.

143
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:19,630
Yeah.

144
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,870
And if you kind of go down that route,
it can lead you into,

145
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,690
there is no limit kind of to where it 
can lead you and,

146
00:06:25,691 --> 00:06:27,370
and,
and it can explain it.

147
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,233
I think it can also explain kind of like
now we're in this weird paradoxical 

148
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:32,314
situation in terms of society where 
since the sixties people have been 

149
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:37,050
telling us,
you know,

150
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,073
that in emphasizing that aspect,
the idea that novelty will increase 

151
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:43,144
pleasure,
let's say bring you further into 

152
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:45,364
pleasure.
But then realizing that if you go down 

153
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:49,390
that road,
now we're kind of realizing,

154
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:49,990
you know,
it's like,

155
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,823
oh,
now we're surrounded by sexual perverts 

156
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:55,060
and we're wondering why we're surrounded
by sexual perverts.

157
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:55,721
It's like,
well,

158
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:56,554
maybe you lead them down that road and 
that road doesn't necessarily lead to 

159
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:00,604
just sunshine and rainbows.
Like it leads to very dark places which 

160
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:06,010
include a lot of violence and a lot of,
of,

161
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:07,730
uh,
of an exploration of,

162
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:09,400
of animosity and,
and a,

163
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,260
and a mixture of desire and hatred and 
all those,

164
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,460
those very strange things that people 
kind of let themselves fall into.

165
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,343
Yeah.
Well you might say that that's in some 

166
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:20,250
sense the story of food life.
Yes,

167
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:20,920
exactly.

168
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,401
I mean,
yeah,

169
00:07:21,401 --> 00:07:24,630
we've talked about that before,
that if you look at full codes,

170
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,593
if you look at [inaudible] life,
he's almost like a microcosm of what's 

171
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:29,044
happening today in terms of his,
he's like radical exploration of power 

172
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:33,814
and sexuality,
but also like the idea of the constant 

173
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:38,980
stranger and the constant anonymous 
anonymity of,

174
00:07:38,981 --> 00:07:40,980
of sexual encounters.
Um,

175
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,020
I think that for sure I see him really 
as a,

176
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,590
as someone to look at in terms of 
understanding the,

177
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:48,490
the,
the,

178
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:50,200
um,
the tone of what's happening

179
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,050
today.
It seems to me to be the case.

180
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,520
It's interesting too,
because Foodco dirt,

181
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,670
I didn't care for each other.
No,

182
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,700
I'm,
you know,

183
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,290
foodco basically regarded dared as a 
trickster,

184
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:05,440
as a wordy,
excuse me,

185
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:09,240
as a wordy trickster and um,
but they,

186
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,223
they are,
their ideas fall into alignment with 

187
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:15,160
regards to the notion of the excluded as
far as I can tell.

188
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:15,880
Yeah.

189
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,600
Well,
the thing that,

190
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,320
the difference I would say with the,
I,

191
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:22,450
I find that more useful in terms of,
you know,

192
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,493
I've talked about this in my different 
talks about this notion that what's 

193
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,260
upside down can be turned back on his 
head back on its feet.

194
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,273
And I think that data is more useful to,
to play that game where you can use him 

195
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,920
and some of these categories to include 
them in a larger frame,

196
00:08:38,921 --> 00:08:42,190
let's say,
so that his ideas are included in a more

197
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,160
complete vision of reality.
Uh,

198
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:48,250
because he has like,
he really shows the real,

199
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,693
his,
his way of thinking really shows the 

200
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:53,140
real danger,
the real problem of postmodernism.

201
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,040
Like,
you know,

202
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,873
you talk about that,
like how is it that there's this 

203
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,020
contradiction,
for example,

204
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,040
his philosophy has been described as 
like the philosophy of hesitation,

205
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,130
you know,
and that makes total sense because,

206
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,690
you know,
when your face he,

207
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,160
he has this notion that you're faced,
uh,

208
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,223
you know,
and in this slipping and sliding a 

209
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,210
analysis of the world where all the,
all,

210
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,390
you know,
reality is,

211
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,270
multiplies itself,
is deferred,

212
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,060
you know,
that,

213
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,740
that,
uh,

214
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,360
things always point towards the future.

215
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,193
So you never know exactly what something
is because it keeps changing and it 

216
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:27,990
keeps,
it keeps slipping into something else.

217
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,190
And so that actually leads to which is 
true things.

218
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,020
Exactly.
And would that actually leads to this,

219
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:34,500
this,
uh,

220
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,333
this hesitation.
And if you've ever seen an interview 

221
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,370
with Dr,
you'll see it in his,

222
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,340
in his demeanor.
He's constantly hesitating.

223
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,600
He's hesitating to speak because he's 
always kind of like,

224
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,140
he doesn't know.
He,

225
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,860
he realized that he doesn't know the 
total implications of what he's about to

226
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:51,800
say all the time.
So he's always like,

227
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,720
he's,
he's like,

228
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,590
he's constantly cautious and conscious 
and cautious.

229
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,553
Um,
and so it seems like that's actually 

230
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,440
what should be normally derived out of 
the kind of postmodern idea that,

231
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:06,180
that,
that meaning cannot be contained.

232
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,510
Whereas Fuko,
he really,

233
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,480
he really used the kind of inverted idea
of truth,

234
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,433
the idea of the truth of the marginal,
where you can use marginality as a 

235
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:20,010
weapon to destroy the,
uh,

236
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,070
let's say that the current order data

237
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,641
you think.
Okay,

238
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:26,720
so you think that's more attributable to
Foodco them to Teradata?

239
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,980
I think so.
What did he do that does it too,

240
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,570
but when he does,
it's weird because he,

241
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:33,630
he'll use the marginal to kind of 
deconstruct the,

242
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:34,860
uh,
the center,

243
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:35,694
let's say,
but then he'll also kind of in a set in 

244
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:40,360
the same way,
he'll also say he'll also heal,

245
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:43,320
like reverse it,
and then an ilet his reversal.

246
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,213
So he ended up really in this slippery 
slope where you don't even know where 

247
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,580
he,
where you're standing.

248
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,170
Um,
and uh,

249
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,480
and so in my opinion that's useful 
because it helps you to see the,

250
00:10:53,481 --> 00:10:54,314
the,
the actually it kind of Indiana did 

251
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,603
points back towards logos.
It pointed back towards logos in the 

252
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:00,990
sense that we can,
like we talked about,

253
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,310
you can't live in a world like that.

254
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,433
Okay.
So that's.

255
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,293
So that's,
that's exactly what I want to develop 

256
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:06,980
today.
Okay.

257
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:09,170
So the first thing that I thought of 
today is that,

258
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,243
okay,
so we have this issue of undecidability 

259
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:13,484
from daredevil,
the thing that doesn't fit in the 

260
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:15,690
category.
Yeah.

261
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,401
Okay.
Now.

262
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:17,234
And we know that if you have a category,
there's way more outside the category 

263
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:20,804
then there is inside the category 
because otherwise the category isn't 

264
00:11:22,761 --> 00:11:24,210
very useful.
Right?

265
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,170
Right.
And so if Derek talks about that as an,

266
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,900
I think food co two at least alludes to 
it,

267
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:34,520
is that they kind of make the case that 
the purpose of the category system is to

268
00:11:34,521 --> 00:11:38,720
exclude and then they make a political 
case out of that as well.

269
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,873
Now the thing is,
is the purpose of a category is to 

270
00:11:41,571 --> 00:11:42,404
exclude.
It's to exclude an infinite multitude 

271
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,740
because you can't deal with an infinite 
multitude,

272
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,633
and so you have to simplify the world.
You have to categorize the world in 

273
00:11:52,131 --> 00:11:53,750
order to act on it.
Okay,

274
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:53,980
so

275
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,813
then the ultimate question has to be 
something like by what principle do you 

276
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,870
or what principal guides your 
categorization of the world,

277
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,453
and that seems to me to point back to 
the logo in exactly the way that you 

278
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:06,604
just described because I would say the 
logos is the divine principle of 

279
00:12:10,181 --> 00:12:12,300
categorization or something like that.
Oh,

280
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,120
there.
There are two.

281
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,140
There are actually two ways to do it 
there.

282
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,790
I think that I talked about that,
talked about how.

283
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,530
Talking about this in Vancouver,
it's like there's either.

284
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,620
There's three possibilities,
there's either the logos,

285
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,100
there is either absolute dissemination,
which is this kind of the,

286
00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:31,934
the,
the idea that something will just kind 

287
00:12:32,821 --> 00:12:33,654
of dissolve.
It dissolves into uncertainty and and 

288
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,470
it's important to understand the result 
of that.

289
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:42,670
The result of that isn't that it'll just
stay in this kind of shaky uncertainty.

290
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,250
The result of that is that something 
else from the outside,

291
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,233
which has solidity is going to ran 
through it and I think that's something 

292
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:52,030
that Dickie that didn't account for,
you know,

293
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,310
for example,
I don't think Dick and die accounted for

294
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,600
Islam for example.

295
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,860
It's like he thought,
well,

296
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:58,210
if we're all,
if we all,

297
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,133
if we're all kind of in this slippery 
slidey situation without from 

298
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:05,290
identities,
then we have no reason to fight.

299
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,513
Right.
That's kind of like the positive 

300
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:10,090
infinite number of reasons to fight.
Yeah.

301
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:11,060
Maybe.
Exactly.

302
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,660
Or maybe we have an infinite number of 
reasons to fight,

303
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:14,643
but he didn't see that something on the 
outside which has strength will just 

304
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:20,470
then just come right through that and 
get.

305
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,480
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

306
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:23,314
Well I think he thought he,
he was probably Eurocentric in his 

307
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:27,400
outlook.
Yeah,

308
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,700
that's hilarious.
It is.

309
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,030
It's really hilarious.
It's really hilarious.

310
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,103
Okay,
so.

311
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,000
Alright.
So we've talked about that.

312
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:40,570
Decide to build it or thinking about 
undecidability that we need to mention,

313
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:41,404
which makes it more complicated is that 
undecidability also has to do with time 

314
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,543
and so it has to do.
And this is something actually that you 

315
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:49,120
have in common,
I think,

316
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:53,290
with which you might be funny to say,
but the idea that you,

317
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,260
that something,
let's say you talked about that,

318
00:13:56,261 --> 00:13:57,880
an example of you said like when,
when,

319
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,690
when Ford created the car,
he didn't know what it was because that,

320
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,520
that,
the,

321
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,130
the,
the,

322
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:04,963
uh,
say the totality of what the car 

323
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:07,990
represents it is,
is,

324
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,973
is manifesting itself in time 
manifesting itself in like urban 

325
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:15,190
landscape in the way we understand 
economy and in a way.

326
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,260
And so the,
the,

327
00:14:16,261 --> 00:14:17,094
the,
like the ramifications were so big that 

328
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:23,281
you could never know what a car is 
that's called talks about in terms of,

329
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,340
of,
uh,

330
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,280
the deferral of meaning in,
in,

331
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,250
in time.
So there's that idea of,

332
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,640
of difference in terms of,
of um,

333
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,480
you know,
like that there's categories in debt,

334
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,390
they're defined by their opposites and 
either their outer categories,

335
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:43,270
but then there's also this idea of time 
that makes it more complicated to.

336
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,193
Yeah.
Well,

337
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,033
what that means is that what it is 
depends to some degree on the spatial 

338
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:51,260
and temporal context within which you're
interpreting it.

339
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah.
You can say that way.

340
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:53,983
Yep.
Yep.

341
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,920
I had a dream about that at one point.
I don't know if it's a digression,

342
00:14:57,921 --> 00:14:58,670
I don't care.
I'll,

343
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,600
I'll tell you.
Anyways,

344
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,990
so I dreamt this is such a strange 
dream.

345
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:04,630
I dreamt that,
um,

346
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,893
there was this ball
floating above the Atlantic Ocean and 

347
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:12,200
uh,
it was just zooming log about,

348
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,720
you know,
six feet above the surface just cruising

349
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:15,554
along and uh,
it was so powerful that it was 

350
00:15:18,741 --> 00:15:19,574
accompanied by four hurricanes,
one in each quadrant surrounding the 

351
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:24,570
ball.
It was only a little ball.

352
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,990
And that was the first part of the 
dream.

353
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:30,710
The second part of the dream was a,
like a view of satellites and a bunch of

354
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:33,260
scientists who are monitoring the hell 
out of this thing,

355
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:35,500
trying to figure out what it was.
Um,

356
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,230
the third scene was this thing was 
trapped in a room.

357
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,540
It was like in a Victorian Museum case,
you know,

358
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:42,374
what would case with glass and it was 
sitting up there like suspended in 

359
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,890
midair are inside the case and the same 
ball.

360
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:49,220
Yeah,
there.

361
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,430
So they captured it.
And so then,

362
00:15:51,431 --> 00:15:54,530
um,
it was in the room,

363
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,410
the room had no doors or windows in the 
room,

364
00:15:57,411 --> 00:16:02,411
there was the president of the United 
States and Stephen Hawking and so that,

365
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,710
and then the room was made out of 
titanium dioxide.

366
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:09,440
I remember that from the dream,
which turns out to be the stuff that the

367
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,530
hall of the starship enterprise is made 
out of.

368
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,490
Something like that.
Yeah,

369
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,700
yeah.
It was something like that.

370
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:17,534
And so the idea was that this intensely 
powerful thing had been put inside a 

371
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,460
category system.
Right?

372
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:26,330
So the inside a museum display case,
and then there was the president,

373
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:30,020
there are sort of representation of 
social order and Stephen Hawking,

374
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,230
he was a representation of disembodied 
intellect.

375
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,310
And then there was the room itself which
had impenetrable walls.

376
00:16:37,311 --> 00:16:39,220
They were like six feet thick.
So we,

377
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,063
it was like,
we got this thing and then then I was 

378
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:44,990
watching it.
It turned into a Chrysalis.

379
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,860
So obviously,
which is something that can transform.

380
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:49,694
Right,
exactly.

381
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,080
And then it turned into a mere sean 
pipe.

382
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,670
It took me about a year to figure that 
out.

383
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,770
It was an illusion to a famous painting 
by Magritte.

384
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,570
Right.
This is not a pipe.

385
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,351
Isn't that a pipe?
Yeah,

386
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:04,370
that's cool.
Actually,

387
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:05,330
like quite a bit.
Yeah.

388
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,100
Yeah.
And then it shot out of the broom,

389
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:09,500
like there was nothing there.
Interesting.

390
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,550
Yeah,
that's a great dream.

391
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,520
It was a great dream man.
And so,

392
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,040
and it,
it,

393
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,873
it does allude to this idea that you 
can't capture the thing in permanently 

394
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:19,730
in a category system because it shifts 
and turns.

395
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,833
Yeah.
Yeah.

396
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,980
So,
okay.

397
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,900
So,
so fine.

398
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,130
So we're on board with that.
Alright.

399
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,053
So now the category has to exclude 
because reality is so complex that you 

400
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:32,810
have to categorize it because otherwise 
you're swamped.

401
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,640
It's a good metaphor for it.
Yeah.

402
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,523
And I think that's something that the 
postmodern is our you that didn't 

403
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:40,250
totally see the extent to which that 
could be.

404
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,710
Right?
I think so.

405
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,400
Right?
Right.

406
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,110
Absolutely.
I think he,

407
00:17:44,111 --> 00:17:44,810
he,
he,

408
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,643
he put,
I think he thought that order was a lot 

409
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:49,720
more solid than it was.
Yeah.

410
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,520
So,
so,

411
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,300
or then it is.
So then I was thinking,

412
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,130
okay,
so now in with identity politics,

413
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:03,450
you have the politics of the excluded.
All right,

414
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:06,480
so,
so then you have people excluded because

415
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:10,320
of race or because of gender or because 
of sexual identity or whatever.

416
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,130
And one of the problems we've seen with 
that is that the number of excluded keep

417
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:16,830
multiplying.
That's why you get that extension of the

418
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:19,410
letters in the lgbt acronym.
Right.

419
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,540
And there doesn't seem to be any limit 
to that.

420
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:22,374
And the reason for that is there is no 
limit to the number or excluded because 

421
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,570
it's the category of excluded is the 
category of all things that don't fit in

422
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:31,590
the category system.
And that's an infinite set,

423
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,453
right?
Yeah.

424
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,300
Okay.
So,

425
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,010
but then I woke up this morning and I 
thought,

426
00:18:35,011 --> 00:18:37,650
well we could do,
we could calculate that mathematically.

427
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,080
So because,
because I was thinking about the rise of

428
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:46,400
intersectionality,
because the rise of intersectionality,

429
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:47,234
is that actually the reoccurrence of the
individual within the collective ideas 

430
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:53,460
of postmodern neo Marxism,
because you might say,

431
00:18:53,461 --> 00:18:54,294
well,
I'm excluded because I'm black or I'm 

432
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:57,324
excluded because I'm a woman,
and then someone puts up their hand and 

433
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:00,480
says,
well,

434
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,690
those two categories don't include black
woman.

435
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,480
They don't include the intersection of 
the,

436
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,433
of the two categories,
and that there's no reason that black 

437
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:13,200
and woman is more important than black 
woman.

438
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,840
Okay.
So then I thought,

439
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:17,340
all right,
so that's fine.

440
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:18,174
So the problem is,
is that you start to get smaller and 

441
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:25,440
smaller numbers of people as exemplars 
of the categories that are excluded.

442
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,540
So then I thought,
well,

443
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,183
how many categories do you need to add 
in an intersectional analysis before 

444
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:34,470
you're actually down to one in a 
billion?

445
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,090
Because you do fractionated down to the 
individual.

446
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,340
So now it's kind of screwy 
mathematically because it depends on the

447
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:47,100
grid nations of your category system,
right?

448
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,620
I mean,
I could call you old or young,

449
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,670
that'd be binary,
right?

450
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,590
But I could say,
no,

451
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,080
no,
you're on a scale from zero to 100,

452
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,450
so that would,
that would be,

453
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,433
that would give you a point zero,
one probability of there'll be 100 

454
00:20:02,341 --> 00:20:03,174
groups that you could belong to in age.
So I thought well let's just use 100 as 

455
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:10,440
an example because it could be two or it
could be 10,000.

456
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,390
It's arbitrary because we could say 
that,

457
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,900
well I'm 41 and there's advantages and 
disadvantages that go along with that.

458
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,403
But someone else could say,
well I'm 41 in six months and there's a 

459
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:25,650
slightly different set of advantages and
disadvantages that go along with that.

460
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,473
So anyways,
if you have six categories with a 

461
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:32,520
probability of point one,
then you're one in a billion,

462
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,073
so you just need six dimensions of 
intersectionality before you 

463
00:20:37,331 --> 00:20:40,350
fractionated the population down to the 
level of the individual.

464
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,390
So just so that,
that means the individual comes sneaking

465
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:46,224
back into the collective ideas of 
postmodernism once you hit six 

466
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:52,950
intersectional categories.
That's interesting.

467
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,610
That was,
I thought that was really.

468
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,920
Well,
it's ridiculous music.

469
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:57,754
So I said this will do the trick.
So if you're multiracial woman who's 

470
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,980
bisexual,
27 years old,

471
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,370
smart 30th percentile for 
attractiveness,

472
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,990
10th percentile for familial wealth and 
80th percentile for education.

473
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,730
There's,
there is the.

474
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:16,564
Oh,
you're the only one in the world like 

475
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,484
that.

476
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,720
So,
okay.

477
00:21:25,721 --> 00:21:27,220
So then I was thinking,
okay,

478
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:30,700
so now then I was also thinking about 
this from a scientific perspective.

479
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:31,534
So the reason you assigned,
if you're going to do an experiment on 

480
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:35,524
two groups,
you know you do something to one group 

481
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:42,130
but not to the other group,
but to make the control group proper,

482
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:42,964
you have to assign randomly to each 
group and the reason you do random 

483
00:21:46,691 --> 00:21:47,524
association is because there's an 
infinite number of variables you can't 

484
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:50,704
control for.
And so you assigned randomly so that 

485
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:54,334
infinity cancels,
cancels itself out and the only 

486
00:21:56,921 --> 00:22:00,970
difference you're left with is the 
experimental condition.

487
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,050
And then scientists sometimes try to get
around that.

488
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,913
Like we used to study people who were 
sons of alcoholics and multi and they 

489
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:13,000
had a multigenerational family history 
of alcoholism.

490
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,373
And then we were trying to figure out 
what might distinguish them from a 

491
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:17,740
normal person,
let's say.

492
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,220
So we try to get a control group to 
contrast them with,

493
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:22,054
so we bring them into the lab,
say and give them alcohol and give the 

494
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:24,874
control group alcohol.
But the problem was we didn't know what 

495
00:22:27,251 --> 00:22:29,470
to control for,
like,

496
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,160
because alcoholism goes along with 
antisocial personality disorder.

497
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,580
So do you control for that?
Um,

498
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,300
do you control for education?
Do you control for Icu?

499
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,433
Do you control for socioeconomic status?
Like the answer is you don't know 

500
00:22:45,311 --> 00:22:48,310
because you don't know how those are 
associated with the alcoholism,

501
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,713
you can't know.
And so you gas and then you do an 

502
00:22:51,641 --> 00:22:53,700
analysis of covariance.
But the problem is,

503
00:22:53,701 --> 00:22:55,310
is that you don't know what to 
covariate,

504
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,060
which is why you need random assigned to
groups.

505
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,550
It's the only way of solving that 
problem.

506
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,730
Okay.
So the same problem of undecidability in

507
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:07,180
some sense pops up very,
very frequently in clinical research.

508
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,153
Right?
Same thing happens if you're trying to 

509
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:11,170
figure out schizophrenia,
you need a control group.

510
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,540
Well,
how about siblings?

511
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,580
The siblings who don't have 
schizophrenia?

512
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:16,631
Well,
yeah,

513
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:19,220
except they have a different geno type,
you know,

514
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,103
it's an,
it's an impossible problem to solve 

515
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,470
fundamentally.
Which is why you need random association

516
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,760
to groups because you can't control for 
all the variables.

517
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,370
You can't know in advance what's 
relevant.

518
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,520
Alright.
So then I had this.

519
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,043
So I thought that was very funny that 
the idea of individuality comes back 

520
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,600
with intersectionality.
It's,

521
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,523
it's just you just push 
intersectionality to six dimensions and 

522
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,980
Bang,
you're down to the individual.

523
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,560
All right?
So then I had this little vision,

524
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,240
so I'm going to tell You the vision.
Okay?

525
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,280
Alright.
Alright.

526
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:55,610
So imagine a pyramid,
like imagine a plane first,

527
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:59,990
like at a place in a place,
a land but flat,

528
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,640
and then imagine a pyramid and then 
around the pyramid,

529
00:24:04,641 --> 00:24:08,330
some distance from it is a wall.
Okay?

530
00:24:08,331 --> 00:24:11,420
So think about that just as the basic 
scheme of a walled city.

531
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,063
Okay.
Now the pyramid is the group that's in 

532
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:15,980
there,
let's say,

533
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,010
and the value structure that that group 
orients itself by.

534
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,620
Okay.
Now outside that wall,

535
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,733
there's a very large number of other 
pyramids and that's basically the 

536
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:27,494
postmodern world.
I would say that's kind of the world 

537
00:24:28,821 --> 00:24:31,580
that they're described and is set 
reasonable.

538
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,880
I,
I don't.

539
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,813
Yeah,
I mean could continue or example I 

540
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,270
think,
I think that for sure that he did,

541
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,163
he would say would say something like,
when we talk about the problem of the 

542
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:50,180
contain,
even the contained space,

543
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:50,871
you know,
the,

544
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:54,140
the idea of the wall and the pyramid,
I'm like,

545
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:55,220
he would,
he would have,

546
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,083
he would have a problem.
You would have a problem with that 

547
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,260
structure itself.
Like for him that would be,

548
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,363
that would be a,
it wouldn't be a solid structure would 

549
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,510
have been flooded with time.
Yeah,

550
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,321
right.
That's okay,

551
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:07,860
we'll get to that.
That's fine.

552
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,270
No problem.
Let's say that is

553
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,360
the problem.
Right?

554
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,370
Okay.
So you added another dimension to it.

555
00:25:12,371 --> 00:25:15,070
The problem is there's an insight and a 
wall and an outside.

556
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,070
That's problem number one.
Outside excludes,

557
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:18,983
we could call that problem number two.
Problem number three is that the center 

558
00:25:22,481 --> 00:25:24,100
will not hold.
Right?

559
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,473
Right.
And that's the same problem as far as 

560
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,690
I'm concerned as the serpent in the 
garden of Eden.

561
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,860
Yeah.
Okay.

562
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,670
Okay,
good.

563
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,810
Good.
So,

564
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,220
so let's say that really is the problem.
I mean fundamentally

565
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:37,403
yeah.
Usually if you go back to the garden of 

566
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:41,710
Eden and you find the problem somehow,
so

567
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,630
now,
now imagine that outside the,

568
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,090
um,
outside the wall,

569
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,953
all those pyramids fragment and fragment
down to the level of individual people 

570
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:52,963
so they decompose to the level of 
individual people because that's how 

571
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:56,954
much variability there actually is 
because those groups were artificial 

572
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:04,190
constructions and so you can fragment 
them down to the individual.

573
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,623
Okay,
so now the question is you want to let 

574
00:26:07,371 --> 00:26:09,650
some of those people into the enclosed.
Okay.

575
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,090
Now,
next part of the vision,

576
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,740
the pyramid grows across on top of it.
Now it's a church,

577
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,643
it's the center.
And the cross represents whatever the 

578
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,450
ordering principle of that center is.
Okay.

579
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:24,284
So then I would say an,
and you're going to add to this because 

580
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:29,660
you did at the beginning of the talk 
already,

581
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,630
the cross is the center point of the 
world.

582
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,260
It's the axis of the world.
So it's the world tree.

583
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,980
It's also the place of suffering and 
it's the place of suffering,

584
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:47,310
excepted voluntarily and transcended.
It's all of those things.

585
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,240
Yeah.
Okay.

586
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:49,074
And so that it crosses also assemble of 
the hero and the hero is the person who 

587
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:58,860
confronts chaos and gain something of 
value from it.

588
00:26:58,861 --> 00:26:59,694
So that's voluntary and the hero is also
the person who recasts the archaic 

589
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:06,780
structure of the structure when it's 
necessary.

590
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,573
Right.
And so you see those hero themes 

591
00:27:10,951 --> 00:27:15,951
developed quite regularly across any 
reasonable historical span of time.

592
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,650
So that's the redeemer,
the Messiah,

593
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,123
right?
It's that makes order out of chaos and 

594
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:26,640
then takes order when it's too rigid and
breaks it apart.

595
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:27,700
And recasts yeah.

596
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,800
Yeah.
You see that in the story of King David,

597
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,990
you see that actually really well,
like very,

598
00:27:31,991 --> 00:27:33,290
very well.
He,

599
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:35,980
he breaks like he acts as the pool and 
as a,

600
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,023
as a,
as someone who is actually a kind of 

601
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,693
thief,
trickster figure while the tyrant is in 

602
00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:44,880
power.
And then when that tire and fall,

603
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:49,510
then he comes in and creates a new 
centralized order by bringing the Ark to

604
00:27:49,511 --> 00:27:51,910
Jerusalem.
So he has that whole arc and his story.

605
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,750
It's a very good version of it.

606
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,410
Good.
I'll keep that in mind for when I get to

607
00:27:56,411 --> 00:27:59,050
that story.
In my biblical lectures,

608
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,153
all right,
so now you have to open the door on on 

609
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:07,570
the on the wall,
and the question is who do you let in?

610
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,190
So here's the idea,

611
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:11,923
okay,
so you need to have a center and the 

612
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:14,624
center has to hold because things are 
too complex without a center and a 

613
00:28:17,211 --> 00:28:20,450
category system,
and then the question is,

614
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,823
let's say that your category system has 
to exist in accordance with the process 

615
00:28:25,611 --> 00:28:26,444
that creates it and revitalizes it 
because otherwise it can't maintain its 

616
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:31,544
stability across time.
It degenerates into chaos or it 

617
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:37,010
rigidified into too much order.
Right?

618
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,383
Okay,
so the only people that you lead into 

619
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:40,544
this,
the inside the wall or those who agree 

620
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:49,060
to live by the rule ethic at the ethic 
that symbolized by the cross.

621
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,083
That's two things.
That's the willingness to abide by a 

622
00:28:53,271 --> 00:28:56,870
certain level of social organization,
but it's more importantly,

623
00:28:56,871 --> 00:28:57,704
it's also the ability to transcend that 
and to participate in the process by 

624
00:29:01,761 --> 00:29:04,310
which chaos has confronted and 
voluntarily,

625
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,353
voluntarily confronted and reordered and
also to participate in the process by 

626
00:29:08,961 --> 00:29:12,860
which order is
broken.

627
00:29:12,861 --> 00:29:13,694
When it's too rigid and brought back.
That's the death and resurrection 

628
00:29:17,301 --> 00:29:18,134
essentially.
Yeah.

629
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,973
So those are the only people that you 
can let inside the structure without 

630
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,373
pose,
without imposing a fatal threat to the 

631
00:29:25,281 --> 00:29:28,640
structure itself.
And then if the walls fall,

632
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:33,050
then the infinite multitudes stream in 
and we're done.

633
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,380
No,
I mean we,

634
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,370
it ceases to exist.
It's like you just cease to exist.

635
00:29:37,371 --> 00:29:38,960
That's all,
you know that that's all.

636
00:29:38,961 --> 00:29:40,470
That's all it is.
Right?

637
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,050
Well,
and you'd also say that that's,

638
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,933
that's the problem that's being thought 
about in some sense with regards to the 

639
00:29:47,741 --> 00:29:51,670
border issue in Europe.
Do we have a right to have a border?

640
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,253
Right.
And then I was thinking today about a 

641
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:55,024
store,
like just take your typical grocery 

642
00:29:57,491 --> 00:29:59,790
store and you say,
well it's a,

643
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:00,803
it's a category system.
Only those with money are allowed to 

644
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,880
bring food out of this place.
Right.

645
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:08,290
And you might say,
well that's,

646
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:13,560
that's a terrible imposition of 
capitalist a patriarchy on and an unfair

647
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:16,414
imposition of capitalist patriarchy.
So you throw the doors open and you say 

648
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,230
everybody come and take what they want.
Yeah.

649
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,950
And that works really well until the 
store is empty.

650
00:30:23,951 --> 00:30:24,784
And then that's the end of that,
because if everyone could do anything 

651
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:28,744
they want whenever they want,
then not then it's complete and utter 

652
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:33,550
chaos.

653
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:37,020
Yeah.
And then what happens is what happens in

654
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:37,854
it,
because I've lived in a place that is 

655
00:30:38,591 --> 00:30:41,530
absolute and utter chaos and chaos 
doesn't,

656
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,693
cannot sustain itself.
And so usually what happens is the rise 

657
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:46,534
of a warlord of a tyrant,
the rise of someone who will by sheer 

658
00:30:50,711 --> 00:30:53,140
force,
by sheer physical forest,

659
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,100
impose their will on others because the 
others will be,

660
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,650
will have nothing to unite them.
And so it's not,

661
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:01,090
it's not true.
That know a lot of,

662
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,953
you know,
you unique anarchists and people who 

663
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:06,040
think that,
that there is such a thing as like a,

664
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,133
you know,
there's just kind of free anarchy where 

665
00:31:08,261 --> 00:31:11,230
everybody's equal and everybody can do 
whatever they want.

666
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,410
That doesn't exist because the end,
that anarchy comes a tyrant,

667
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:17,590
inevitably there's no,
there's no stopping it right

668
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,710
into anarchy comes a tyrant.
Yeah,

669
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,450
absolutely.
Absolutely.

670
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,050
And that's the,
that's the problem with that is that the

671
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,550
fundamental organizing principle,
the tyrant is tyranny.

672
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,560
Yeah.
Pure,

673
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,270
pure power,
pure power.

674
00:31:32,271 --> 00:31:35,540
And pure also a personality cult,
like the,

675
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:40,630
it's that it's that person instead of 
being an ideal onto which we,

676
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,200
we serve,
you know,

677
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:42,551
our,
uh,

678
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:45,440
our mythic figure or a or a divine 
figure.

679
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,570
It becomes a guy,
you know,

680
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,450
it'd become,
become Hitler or it becomes a,

681
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,433
you know,
it becomes a napoleon or it becomes 

682
00:31:52,721 --> 00:31:54,280
solid or become whatever.
Like it's,

683
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,403
it's that person.
Everything is embodied in their 

684
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,050
personality.
Like I always say,

685
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,630
like I always have this image of,
of,

686
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:07,631
of a functional system is,
is the person who in some manner is able

687
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:10,124
to,
to at least symbolically stepped down 

688
00:32:12,201 --> 00:32:14,270
from their power.
They always say that,

689
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,280
that George Washington,
what made him so great is that he,

690
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:19,850
he really,
he stopped being president.

691
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,480
What created the impetus for the system 
to work and in the same,

692
00:32:23,481 --> 00:32:26,000
in the Roman empire like Augustus,
you know,

693
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:27,080
people will,
will,

694
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:31,010
will say that he didn't really do it.
But when Augustus became emperor,

695
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:36,190
he stepped into the city as a citizen 
and he gave away all his power.

696
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,280
And by giving away all his,
in a strange way,

697
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:43,100
he actually became the most powerful 
person in Rome,

698
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:46,160
but his power was not illegal power.
It was like a,

699
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,200
it was like there was something about 
his capacity to not be the tyrant,

700
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,213
which,
which,

701
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,430
which stabilized the empire and made him
very powerful,

702
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,690
but in a,
in a strain,

703
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:59,080
in a very kind of strange way.
It's different.

704
00:32:59,090 --> 00:32:59,250
Right?

705
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,083
So,
so like a legitimate ruler has to be 

706
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,190
bound by proper sovereign authority.

707
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:05,900
Yeah,
exactly.

708
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,780
I can give themselves to the,
to the,

709
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:10,180
to the Senate and said,
I'm at your service.

710
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,073
And so it made him very powerful.
But you also kind of bound his power in 

711
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,170
the Senate,

712
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:15,711
right?
Right.

713
00:33:15,711 --> 00:33:16,544
Well,
you see that emerging as early as 

714
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:18,464
Mesopotamia,
where Martech or where the emperor had 

715
00:33:21,261 --> 00:33:22,094
to act out his,
his embodiment of Marduk in the New 

716
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:30,230
Year's festival in Martech was the go 
out hero who went out and confronted the

717
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:31,064
dragon of chaos and made the world.
And so the reason that the emperor had 

718
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,460
a,
it's not sovereignty legitimacy,

719
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,633
that legitimacy is because he was acting
out in architectural pattern that 

720
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:45,650
transcended his own personality.
And then the question is,

721
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:47,180
well,
what's that archetipal pattern?

722
00:33:47,181 --> 00:33:48,014
And the answer to that is that's the 
hero who recasts the tyrannical state 

723
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:53,624
and who confronts chaos.
So the structure that the answer to the 

724
00:33:57,081 --> 00:34:00,260
problem of how you maintain a structure 
in the,

725
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,383
in the flow of time is that you make the
structure itself subordinate to the 

726
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:09,380
principle by which the structure is 
generated.

727
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:14,660
And that means that the,
the sovereign needs to be responsible to

728
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:15,740
the word essentially.

729
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,300
That's,
that's how you would think about it from

730
00:34:17,301 --> 00:34:20,300
a Judeo Christian perspective.
And that's above everything.

731
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:24,410
And it's the thing that does the 
categorization initially.

732
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:27,260
That's when God creates the world 
because of the word.

733
00:34:27,261 --> 00:34:29,450
And when Adam named the animals and all 
of that.

734
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,733
So,
but also maintains that across time 

735
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,770
because it does slip and slide.
Yeah.

736
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,720
So,
you know,

737
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,593
it wasn't really.
See we've been talking about a post 

738
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:42,560
postmodernism,
right?

739
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:44,390
And,
and about a logo centrism.

740
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,810
And we've been kind of laughing about 
that too,

741
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,653
because of,
because of it's referenced to Derrida's 

742
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,840
fellow go centrism.
Um,

743
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,040
but it's funny too,
you know,

744
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:59,000
because if you look at Hindu 
representations of the center,

745
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,223
they're not fellow go centric.
The fellows is embodied in the Lingam 

746
00:35:03,951 --> 00:35:07,970
and the Yoni,
the Fellas is conjoined with the Yoni.

747
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:08,804
It's,
it's a masculine female duality that's 

748
00:35:11,391 --> 00:35:13,580
at the center.
It's not just the masculine.

749
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,840
And so the idea that that center is 
necessarily fell logo centric is,

750
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,420
is also wrong.
Right?

751
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:20,930
But it,
it,

752
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,010
you know,
the thing is that,

753
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:23,683
um,

754
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,450
okay,
this is going to get explicit I guess,

755
00:35:25,451 --> 00:35:28,720
but,
but it is foul logocentric,

756
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:29,740
you know,
the,

757
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,570
even if you imagine the,
the,

758
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,290
the,
the,

759
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,410
the fallis inside the inside,
the,

760
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,710
the,
the woman,

761
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:36,603
the woman,
the foulest is the center and the woman 

762
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,620
envelops the,
uh,

763
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:42,810
the center,
the Phallic Center,

764
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,910
you know.
But I think that that would,

765
00:35:44,911 --> 00:35:45,744
I have been trying to get to.
And I think what we've all been trying 

766
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:49,290
to get to,
what you've been trying to get to too,

767
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:50,124
is,
is to be able to speak of a logo 

768
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:56,670
centrism as in the proper manner that 
is,

769
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,593
to understand that to say logo sent,
logo centrist means that we also 

770
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:04,010
understand like the,
uh,

771
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,630
the power of the,
uh,

772
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:07,320
the,
the,

773
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,360
the power of the frame,
let's say.

774
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,960
So the image I have of the,
of local centrism is really,

775
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,180
there's a,
there's an image of the mother of God,

776
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:19,620
Mary with our hands up like this.
And in her center there's a,

777
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:20,454
there's a,
there's a circle and out of her 

778
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,590
colleagues coming the Christ child and 
inside that,

779
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,060
that,
that circle,

780
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,550
you see the stars as if it's like the 
entire cosmos,

781
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,360
which is the frame for the logos to 
manifest itself in.

782
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,390
And so the idea that

783
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:40,530
nose open virgin to 14th century where 
Mary is holding a globe,

784
00:36:42,131 --> 00:36:42,964
I think generally speaking,
and then she opens up and inside you 

785
00:36:45,221 --> 00:36:48,580
have God the father and he's holding 
Christ on the cross.

786
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,070
So it's a,
it's a,

787
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,500
it's a similar sort of similar sort of 
notion,

788
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:54,523
right?
And so I think that if we understand it 

789
00:36:55,731 --> 00:36:56,640
that way,
it,

790
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:57,583
there's like an implicit in the notion 
of the law of logo centrism there's an 

791
00:37:01,521 --> 00:37:02,354
implicit,
a kind of secret mentioned of the power 

792
00:37:06,201 --> 00:37:10,720
of the feminine in that very term,
if we understand it fully as the,

793
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,150
the,
the need for the kind of,

794
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:15,223
the kind of chaotic outside or the 
chaotic potentiality which frames the 

795
00:37:20,331 --> 00:37:21,164
manifestation of the logos and to 
understand that those two things need 

796
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:25,910
each other.
Like the,

797
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,893
you know,
the logos doesn't manifest themselves 

798
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,650
without a question,
right?

799
00:37:30,651 --> 00:37:32,900
There has to be a question for there to 
be an answer.

800
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,600
And the question is a frame for the 
answer.

801
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,510
It's definitely one that's really 
important.

802
00:37:38,511 --> 00:37:39,344
That's like super important and it,
it shows how powerful the feminine is 

803
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,800
because it actually acts as the,
the,

804
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:45,963
the category that like,
let's say the frame in which the answer 

805
00:37:47,721 --> 00:37:48,554
is given.

806
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:49,880
Okay.
So,

807
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,130
so let's,
let's develop that for a minute.

808
00:37:52,131 --> 00:37:53,540
So,
um,

809
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,460
let me,
let me see.

810
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,333
I had made me think of something that I 
also wanted to tell to talk to you 

811
00:37:59,691 --> 00:38:00,524
about.
Oh yes.

812
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,543
So okay.
So you said the frame is determined by 

813
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:05,230
the question that's answered.
Yeah,

814
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,430
if it's asked that.
Good,

815
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,160
good,
good.

816
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:07,993
Perfect.
So,

817
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:13,340
so this is where I'd been butting heads 
with Sam Harrison,

818
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,340
where you butted heads with Weinstein 
in.

819
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,820
In Vancouver,
right.

820
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,520
Okay.
So because the question is,

821
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,340
okay,
so you have to have a category system.

822
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:28,190
Now Harris basically claims that you can
derive the category system from the,

823
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,830
from the fact.
Right.

824
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,693
But the objection to that is there's an 
infinite number of facts and they don't 

825
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:35,760
tell you what to do with them.
Yeah.

826
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,813
Okay.
So I would say instead that you derive 

827
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:44,431
the category system from your aims 
because categories are there to,

828
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,490
to help you fulfill your goals.

829
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,040
That's how category systems work.
That's why I think of the mess.

830
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,380
Pragmatic.
Okay.

831
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:56,640
So now the question is,
given that your,

832
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,520
your category system includes and 
excludes and defines the world,

833
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,820
what should be the aim of the category 
system,

834
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,073
and so I think that's what the sermon on
the mount talks about because it 

835
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:10,900
basically says what you should aim at 
the highest possible good.

836
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,410
You should aim at union with God.
Let's say whatever that might mean,

837
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,340
that you aim at the highest possible 
good with fully right,

838
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,590
fully right down to the bottom of your 
soul.

839
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:25,591
If you could manage it so that you're 
not broken and band top and twisted in a

840
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:26,584
bunch of different subpersonalities.
So you try to unify yourself as a force 

841
00:39:30,581 --> 00:39:31,414
for the highest good and you do that in 
large part by deciding that being is 

842
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:36,550
worthwhile.
Right?

843
00:39:36,551 --> 00:39:40,090
So you pledge allegiance to the concept 
of being so you're not.

844
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:45,150
You're not like Cain and then you speak 
truth in the service of that Ba and then

845
00:39:46,121 --> 00:39:49,030
that from that your category system 
flows.

846
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,173
So that's another reason that the 
pyramid with the cross is the center of 

847
00:39:53,231 --> 00:39:54,064
the category system.
Because then you get a category system 

848
00:39:56,831 --> 00:39:57,664
that includes what it should include,
if the goal is the establishment of the 

849
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,740
Kingdom of God,
let's say,

850
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:07,030
which is the highest of possible goals 
and excludes what it should exclude.

851
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:08,143
Yeah.
One of the things too that that kind of 

852
00:40:09,651 --> 00:40:14,240
differentiates,
let's say Christian a ontology or like a

853
00:40:14,241 --> 00:40:16,310
Christian,
a Christian cosmology,

854
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,713
is that we have this idea that there is 
an intimate relationship also between 

855
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:25,010
let's say the highest and the lowest.
There is a.

856
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:29,330
There is something which which unites 
them together completely so that.

857
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,880
So that.
So that even beyond,

858
00:40:31,881 --> 00:40:34,940
let's say there's this capacity to move 
outside.

859
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:40,420
How can I say this to to unite things 
together and so there was this idea,

860
00:40:41,321 --> 00:40:45,430
let's say like for example,
there's an idea like the idea of a,

861
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,100
of a normal of a Christian family.
Let's say the,

862
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,750
you know,
the father is the head of the household,

863
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:52,180
you know,
like this idea that people hate today,

864
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,950
but there's this really this sense that 
the,

865
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,520
the head or the or the,
the king or the chief

866
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,540
exists

867
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:00,843
for the,
for the benefit of those that are 

868
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,180
dolores,
that are the lowest,

869
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:07,851
right?
Right.

870
00:41:07,851 --> 00:41:11,900
So that's continually insisted upon in 
the Old Testament.

871
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,753
Yeah.
Because the prophets always come up and 

872
00:41:13,821 --> 00:41:17,150
say to the king,
you're not attending sufficiently to the

873
00:41:17,151 --> 00:41:17,984
widows and the orphans.
And that means that you've become 

874
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,044
corrupt.

875
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,033
Yeah.
And so in a way you can kind of see the 

876
00:41:22,821 --> 00:41:27,380
hierarchy moving up in the sense of 
things looking up towards,

877
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,820
you know,
into the hierarchy.

878
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:33,200
But then there's also a really important
men in which the hierarchy moves down.

879
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,183
And so the idea is that the top of the 
hierarchy exists for the bottom of the 

880
00:41:37,281 --> 00:41:38,270
hierarchy.
It's like,

881
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,303
so the,
so the top of the hierarchy and in a 

882
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:44,210
really important way as a sac is a 
sacrificial existence.

883
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,690
So the highest thing is,
is,

884
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,593
is there,
the highest street is the one that 

885
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:51,350
sacrificed itself.
For those that are,

886
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,090
that are,

887
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:52,923
think about that,
you can think about that practically as 

888
00:41:54,611 --> 00:41:56,950
the willingness of a father to care for 
an infant.

889
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,330
Yeah,
right.

890
00:41:58,331 --> 00:42:01,780
Yeah.
So because the infant's obviously the.

891
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,840
And of course the infant also has that 
potential,

892
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,600
which is why the infant is made sacred 
as well.

893
00:42:07,601 --> 00:42:09,850
And in that,
in that symbolic rail,

894
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,520
so the highest disserving,
the lowest,

895
00:42:12,521 --> 00:42:15,260
the lowest is the infant,
let's say because it's most helpless.

896
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,520
But the infant is also the future of the
hierarchy.

897
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,150
And so the,
I mean I think that that really,

898
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,660
and we've talked about this before 
slightly,

899
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,920
is that the,
the,

900
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:27,890
the notion that the Christian hero,
you know,

901
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:31,040
I is slightly,
is actually slightly different from the,

902
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:34,010
the pagan hero for example.
So the night,

903
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:37,550
let's say in western Christianity,
the night would be the,

904
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:40,070
the,
the archetipal image of the Christian,

905
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,190
a hero,
which is the notion of an Aristocrat,

906
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,200
a,
a warrior.

907
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:50,430
You know,
a soldier whose purpose is not to.

908
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,583
It is not only to gain honor on himself,
but in a way he gains on or on himself 

909
00:42:56,481 --> 00:42:59,600
by sacrificing himself.
For those who can't do it,

910
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,110
and so he,
his honor is based on the fact that he's

911
00:43:03,111 --> 00:43:05,030
willing to fight for the,
for the widow,

912
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:05,903
the orphan for those that,
that don't have the strength to fight 

913
00:43:08,841 --> 00:43:12,170
for themselves.
And so obviously in reality that doesn't

914
00:43:12,171 --> 00:43:13,100
always play out.
I mean,

915
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,143
but,
but the ideal is there and the ideal is 

916
00:43:15,921 --> 00:43:20,600
real and it's the basis of all our,
all our hero movies,

917
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:21,434
all our hero stories always had this 
idea of the hero is the person who is 

918
00:43:25,131 --> 00:43:28,900
willing to use their strength and their 
power to defend.

919
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,340
Yeah.
To sacrifice themselves for the,

920
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,293
for the week,
which is very different from the pagan 

921
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:34,880
hero.
Like I,

922
00:43:34,881 --> 00:43:36,060
you know,
Achilles.

923
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,433
Yes.
Weakness was contemptible under those 

924
00:43:38,621 --> 00:43:38,980
circles.

925
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:39,813
Right.
And also it's like the only purpose was 

926
00:43:41,651 --> 00:43:42,484
to attain honor on ourselves.
So Achilles is sitting in his tent and 

927
00:43:46,151 --> 00:43:51,151
he's moping and whining because we've 
taken away his sex slave and he won't go

928
00:43:51,701 --> 00:43:54,880
back to fight until it affects him 
personally,

929
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,020
you know.
But he,

930
00:43:56,021 --> 00:43:56,940
he,
he's actually not,

931
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:59,440
he doesn't care that much about helping,
you know,

932
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,990
the Greeks in there,
cause he's really doing that,

933
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:06,070
doing things for his own honor.
And so he's perfectly heroic and sitting

934
00:44:06,071 --> 00:44:08,650
in his tent and moping and not going 
back into,

935
00:44:08,651 --> 00:44:09,950
into battle,
you know,

936
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:13,120
because his honor has been attained.
Whereas in Christianity,

937
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:14,050
you know,
in,

938
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,430
in stories like,
uh,

939
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,850
like if you see Sergei one and,
and uh,

940
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:18,611
you,
you read,

941
00:44:18,611 --> 00:44:19,930
um,
the,

942
00:44:19,931 --> 00:44:20,490
the,
the,

943
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,090
the night and a cart,
for example,

944
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,380
that idea of Lancelot who is willing to 
be seen as a,

945
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:27,820
as a,
as a criminal,

946
00:44:27,821 --> 00:44:28,720
as a,
you know,

947
00:44:28,721 --> 00:44:33,721
as the worst kind of person in order to 
save the helpless Damsel in distress.

948
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:34,650
You know,
he's,

949
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:37,750
he's willing to sacrifice all his honor 
in order to help that,

950
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:40,320
that person who is in danger.
So it's a really,

951
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:42,180
it's a very different way of seeing the 
world.

952
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:49,001
Okay.
Well,

953
00:44:49,001 --> 00:44:52,840
I don't know what to say after all of 
that fit into the whole thing,

954
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,170
but he did have the cross that.
No,

955
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:57,520
absolutely not.
I'm not.

956
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:01,300
I'm not suggesting at all that that was 
not relevant to the,

957
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:03,250
to what we've been discussing.
It's dead relevant.

958
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:04,323
I really liked the idea.
I know we've talked about the fact that 

959
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,080
the,
you know,

960
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:12,430
I've been conceptualized Christ as the,
as the apex of the hierarchy,

961
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,353
symbolically speaking,
but the apex to such a degree that it 

962
00:45:15,701 --> 00:45:17,890
actually detaches itself from the 
hierarchy,

963
00:45:17,891 --> 00:45:19,420
sort of like horus,
the,

964
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,380
the,
uh,

965
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,340
the,
the uh,

966
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:26,860
Osprey or the what,
what the hell is he a falcon in Egyptian

967
00:45:26,861 --> 00:45:27,611
symbolism,
right?

968
00:45:27,611 --> 00:45:28,444
He's the thing that flies above 
everything that can see or the Egyptian 

969
00:45:30,581 --> 00:45:31,414
I add.
Your correction was that it's not 

970
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,393
exactly.
Once you're detached in some sense 

971
00:45:37,541 --> 00:45:38,374
you're not at the top anymore.
You're everywhere spread throughout the 

972
00:45:41,351 --> 00:45:42,380
entire structure,
which,

973
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,410
which is a very good way of looking at 
it.

974
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:47,160
Right?
And the story of Christ is his story and

975
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,110
his symbolism.
You see that he,

976
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:49,944
he's at the top of the Dome that say in 
the church where he's really exactly 

977
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:54,490
what you're saying.
This kind of,

978
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:57,150
this kind of detached a top of the 
hierarchy,

979
00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:01,320
but then he also stretches all the way 
down into death,

980
00:46:01,321 --> 00:46:03,180
into Haiti's,
into chaos.

981
00:46:03,181 --> 00:46:05,780
And the cross is the other side where,
you know,

982
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:06,623
he is,
he's outside of the city being being 

983
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:10,830
killed by,
by his friends,

984
00:46:10,831 --> 00:46:11,730
by the,
you know,

985
00:46:11,731 --> 00:46:12,990
he's the,
the outcasts,

986
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,220
he's all of those things.
And so he,

987
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,173
he unites the two extremes of the 
hierarchy together and fills the 

988
00:46:18,331 --> 00:46:20,840
hierarchy with logo,
the idea

989
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,610
that he transcends depth.
Again,

990
00:46:22,611 --> 00:46:23,444
I'm just going to take this from a 
psychological perspective because the 

991
00:46:26,211 --> 00:46:29,000
theological waters are getting too deep 
for me here.

992
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:30,933
Well,
they are because I don't understand it 

993
00:46:32,091 --> 00:46:34,340
exactly.
I'm really trying to work it out,

994
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,320
but I don't understand it well enough 
yet.

995
00:46:36,321 --> 00:46:37,154
But the idea that Christ descends into 
hell and rescues people from hell and 

996
00:46:40,641 --> 00:46:41,474
death,
that can be quite straightforwardly 

997
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:48,110
psychologically because the consequence 
of not of erecting a,

998
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:49,523
um,
our category structure that isn't 

999
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:55,370
predicated on the hero is that everyone 
will be inhale and die.

1000
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,231
So,
I mean,

1001
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,840
that's what happened in the Soviet Union
as far as I'm concerned.

1002
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,740
And so those health stories are real 
enough as far as I'm concerned about,

1003
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:07,070
that doesn't speak to their potential 
transcendent reality.

1004
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:08,690
Now there's a whole different issue.
I mean,

1005
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,673
here's something else that's been,
that's been bugging me and I'm just 

1006
00:47:12,771 --> 00:47:13,880
starting to think this through.

1007
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,250
You know,
I do think that there's,

1008
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:19,370
there's an idea that if you're in the 
right place at the right time,

1009
00:47:19,371 --> 00:47:21,290
that everything comes together and lines
up,

1010
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:22,880
you know.
And I was wondering,

1011
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,013
you know,
how a story like the story of Christ is 

1012
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,533
told many,
many ways like from the cosmic to the 

1013
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:33,080
microcosmic,
right?

1014
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:34,043
So,
and one of the macrocosmic stories is 

1015
00:47:36,071 --> 00:47:36,904
the relationship between the 
astrological speculations and Christ 

1016
00:47:39,551 --> 00:47:42,370
himself.
And so there are 12 constellations,

1017
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:46,420
like there are 12 disciples and the 
sudden is Christ essentially.

1018
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:50,290
And that story really works and even 
maps onto the calendar properly.

1019
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:51,603
And so then you think,
well that's because people have one 

1020
00:47:53,441 --> 00:47:54,274
interpretation of that is that's because
people have retold the story at each 

1021
00:47:57,731 --> 00:47:58,564
level of analysis.
But another possible reason for that is 

1022
00:48:02,381 --> 00:48:03,214
that it's synchronous in some sense.
It is the fact that everything comes 

1023
00:48:06,941 --> 00:48:09,280
together around that central access in 
a,

1024
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,410
in a,
in a real way,

1025
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:12,343
and that the story can't help but be 
represented at multiple levels of 

1026
00:48:14,981 --> 00:48:16,350
reality simultaneously.
Yes.

1027
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,460
That's what the story is.
That's the,

1028
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,860
that that's exactly what it's about.
The whole thing is about this,

1029
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:25,200
this,
this lining up of everything,

1030
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:26,940
of everything.
Yeah.

1031
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,890
Yeah.
Okay.

1032
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,140
Okay.
It's hard to see that.

1033
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,420
It'd be hard to see the fullness of 
that.

1034
00:48:33,421 --> 00:48:34,254
When you look at it,
it always kind of jars you because it's 

1035
00:48:35,911 --> 00:48:36,840
so,
you know,

1036
00:48:36,841 --> 00:48:39,180
the story of Christ.
I always tell people like,

1037
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,313
if you pay attention to it,
it will constantly be knocking you down 

1038
00:48:42,691 --> 00:48:43,770
because it,
it,

1039
00:48:43,771 --> 00:48:44,604
uh,
it seems even at a first glance 

1040
00:48:46,831 --> 00:48:47,664
sometimes it seems like it's 
contradictory because Christ is all 

1041
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:50,850
these things like,
you know,

1042
00:48:50,851 --> 00:48:52,620
he's,
he's the teacher,

1043
00:48:52,621 --> 00:48:54,420
he's the king,
he's the shepherd,

1044
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,920
you know,
he's the outcast.

1045
00:48:55,921 --> 00:48:56,890
He's the,
he's,

1046
00:48:56,891 --> 00:48:57,571
uh,
he's the,

1047
00:48:57,571 --> 00:48:58,140
uh,
the,

1048
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,100
uh,
the technician,

1049
00:48:59,101 --> 00:49:00,180
you know,
he's the artist.

1050
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,140
He's.
And so it's like,

1051
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:03,080
how is it that a story can income?

1052
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:06,000
And the more you look in the story,
the why he's a fisherman,

1053
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:06,650
you know,
he's.

1054
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:07,483
And so all these things,
how did all these things can fit in one 

1055
00:49:10,021 --> 00:49:12,330
story.
It's easy to glance over it because it's

1056
00:49:12,331 --> 00:49:13,530
so short.
You're read a gospel,

1057
00:49:13,531 --> 00:49:14,364
you kind of go through it.
But then if you really look at all the 

1058
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:19,200
aspects and you understand the 
traditional categories,

1059
00:49:19,201 --> 00:49:21,570
let's say that in the normal world,
the,

1060
00:49:21,571 --> 00:49:22,620
uh,
let's say the,

1061
00:49:22,621 --> 00:49:25,890
um,
the shepherd and the,

1062
00:49:25,891 --> 00:49:27,840
uh,
the agriculturalists usually are not the

1063
00:49:27,841 --> 00:49:30,900
same person,
but in Christ they're the same person.

1064
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:31,840
He's able to.
He's,

1065
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,060
but we're fish exact.
He's finished,

1066
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,730
but he's a fisherman and he is.
So he's the stumbling stone,

1067
00:49:38,731 --> 00:49:41,250
but he's also the capstone.
So he's stretched like,

1068
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,380
we talk about this idea of stretching 
out the entire hierarchy.

1069
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:44,840
So He's,
he's like,

1070
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:45,750
he,
he,

1071
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:46,310
he's,
that's,

1072
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:48,930
he's the stone that doesn't fit that the
builder.

1073
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:49,920
So here's.

1074
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,401
Yeah,
right,

1075
00:49:50,401 --> 00:49:51,990
exactly.
The builder rejected.

1076
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:52,831
Yeah.
Okay.

1077
00:49:52,831 --> 00:49:53,664
So one of the things I've,
I've come to understand about tyrannies 

1078
00:49:56,881 --> 00:50:00,120
is that if you have a tear tyrannical 
person at the top,

1079
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:01,643
the top isn't just at the top.
The tyranny is mirrored the entire 

1080
00:50:05,701 --> 00:50:06,630
hierarchy,
right?

1081
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,430
It's like a,
like a,

1082
00:50:08,431 --> 00:50:10,230
um,
what are those three d,

1083
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:12,210
holographic,
a hologram.

1084
00:50:12,211 --> 00:50:15,690
It's like a Hologram.
Every part is a reflection of the whole.

1085
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:20,670
And so I wonder if that's analogous.
If you have a pyramid,

1086
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,670
say with the principle of the divine 
hero at the top,

1087
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,010
then what happens is that's reflected at
every single level of the,

1088
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,250
of the hierarchy would be with the 
tyranny,

1089
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,181
right?
Yeah,

1090
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:33,590
it should be.
Except that.

1091
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,970
Yeah,
except that the,

1092
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:37,160
the,
the,

1093
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:38,330
yeah,
the tyranny is,

1094
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:42,620
will be just that,
that kind of up down like that top down,

1095
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:43,643
you know,
light that shines down and kind of puts 

1096
00:50:45,741 --> 00:50:48,470
everything in place.
And then when it reaches the things that

1097
00:50:48,471 --> 00:50:51,170
it doesn't,
that it can't absorb,

1098
00:50:51,171 --> 00:50:53,630
it'll just,
it'll completely cut them off,

1099
00:50:53,631 --> 00:50:54,620
you know,
like it'll kill them,

1100
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:55,490
it'll burn them off,
you know,

1101
00:50:55,491 --> 00:50:56,324
it will just destroy them.
Whereas there's something about 

1102
00:50:58,371 --> 00:51:01,070
Christianity or,
or like a traditional,

1103
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,790
a hierarchy which is a stretching out in
so,

1104
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:08,580
so you could imagine,
let's say in terms of,

1105
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:10,160
of,
of all of Christianity.

1106
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:14,480
It isn't
like they're really,

1107
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:15,820
there is,
there's like a,

1108
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:16,790
a,
a,

1109
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:20,060
a place,
let's say for,

1110
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:24,530
at least in in the world there's a play 
until the last judgment,

1111
00:51:24,531 --> 00:51:25,580
let's say,
until the last judgment.

1112
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:29,660
There's a place for that buffer to be 
there and to be slowly assimilated.

1113
00:51:29,661 --> 00:51:30,560
Right?
And so,

1114
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,670
so it's not,
it doesn't,

1115
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,880
it doesn't totally shut itself off a,
there's a,

1116
00:51:34,881 --> 00:51:35,870
there's a,
there's a,

1117
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:37,730
there's room,
there's a gate,

1118
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,870
you know,
like you said,

1119
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:39,823
and there's always people that can come 
through the gate and that are always 

1120
00:51:41,961 --> 00:51:46,690
kind of entering and slowly being a 
signified assimilated.

1121
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:48,920
But I've just assimilated but also 
transforming it.

1122
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:49,783
You have to,
what it's going to be into what it's 

1123
00:51:50,961 --> 00:51:52,410
going to become.
But it's a,

1124
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,320
but it's not,
it's not a radical process.

1125
00:51:54,321 --> 00:51:56,870
It's like this organic transformation,
let's say.

1126
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,680
That's a huge part of what we're arguing
about right now.

1127
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,830
Culture,
which is,

1128
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:02,003
um,
how is it that you handled the 

1129
00:52:03,801 --> 00:52:05,180
integration,
let's say,

1130
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,310
and the answer is no integration?
No,

1131
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:11,900
because what that does is rigidified the
structure because if you,

1132
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,170
if you close it off completely,
you also rigidified inside.

1133
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,033
Yeah.
And so what that means is the chaos is 

1134
00:52:17,841 --> 00:52:18,674
going to break forth inside.
So because you can't get rid of the 

1135
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:21,740
chaos.
No,

1136
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,580
no.
You know,

1137
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:25,550
one of the things we talked about,
so for example,

1138
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:26,503
with the idea of gay marriage,
so now there's the excluded are 

1139
00:52:29,031 --> 00:52:31,250
included.
Then the question is well,

1140
00:52:31,251 --> 00:52:32,084
what,
what is then the responsibility of the 

1141
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:34,874
get included and the responsibility of 
the included is to not break the 

1142
00:52:39,561 --> 00:52:41,540
structure of the system that included 
them.

1143
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:42,970
You'd set that yet,
you know,

1144
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:43,853
that's a really,
that's a really good way of seeing that 

1145
00:52:45,591 --> 00:52:48,410
because that's an,
that's actually probably the best way of

1146
00:52:48,411 --> 00:52:53,270
understanding a understanding it in 
terms of how it works itself out in real

1147
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:54,110
life.
It's like,

1148
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,400
you know,
if you come in,

1149
00:52:55,490 --> 00:53:00,320
if you come in as an assimilated margin,
you know,

1150
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,333
as,
as a margin that wants to participate 

1151
00:53:02,571 --> 00:53:03,404
in,
in a country or in an identity or in a 

1152
00:53:04,671 --> 00:53:06,470
group or whatever it is,
like in a club,

1153
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,380
like your responsibility is,
like you said,

1154
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:13,100
is to not break what makes that 
something like,

1155
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:15,740
do you know if you want to,
if you want to be a,

1156
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:17,150
you know,
if you want to join a,

1157
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,220
a,
I don't,

1158
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,113
a baseball group and a baseball team and
you come into the team and you're the 

1159
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:27,100
Newbie on the team and you and you all 
of a sudden expect everybody to,

1160
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:29,580
to play basketball,
play basketball.

1161
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,810
It's like,
well then why,

1162
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,460
like what,
what does it destroyed?

1163
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:36,510
It destroyed the club itself.
Exactly.

1164
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,850
No,
you think that's a very simple way?

1165
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:39,511
Yes.
Well,

1166
00:53:39,511 --> 00:53:42,300
we talked about that a little bit with 
the abrahamic stories,

1167
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:43,134
if I remember correctly,
because there was the problem in the 

1168
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:47,730
abrahamic stories of how to deal with 
the marginal.

1169
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,860
So,
um,

1170
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,280
I can't,
unfortunately,

1171
00:53:52,281 --> 00:53:57,090
I can't recreate that on the flight.
It had to do with hospitality,

1172
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,940
hospitality behavior,
right?

1173
00:53:58,941 --> 00:54:03,470
So the rule is I show you hospitality,
but that's my rule by obligation,

1174
00:54:03,471 --> 00:54:04,304
but your obligation is not to do,
not to make passes at my wife and 

1175
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:08,300
disrupt my household.

1176
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:09,803
Yeah.
And then a relationship builds with the 

1177
00:54:12,481 --> 00:54:16,050
stranger and then,
and then slowly the stranger,

1178
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,220
uh,
you know,

1179
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:19,230
it becomes a friend,
you know,

1180
00:54:19,231 --> 00:54:21,540
and then maybe you then maybe the 
stranger,

1181
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:23,630
Mary's your daughter at some point,
right.

1182
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,391
It's like,
you know,

1183
00:54:24,391 --> 00:54:25,350
there's the,
there's the,

1184
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,273
the,
the possibility of creating a 

1185
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:31,710
relationship which will integrate the 
two identities together,

1186
00:54:31,711 --> 00:54:35,220
but it's a gradual process and one which
has to be done,

1187
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,270
you know,
uh,

1188
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,770
with mutual respect.

1189
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:38,561
That's right.
Well,

1190
00:54:38,561 --> 00:54:39,394
even the proper spirit that would,
I would say that would be the spirit of 

1191
00:54:42,131 --> 00:54:46,750
the logos because the logo's is also the
thing that goes outside the boundaries.

1192
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,093
Like,
so let's say you have a person from 

1193
00:54:49,511 --> 00:54:51,970
group a here in person from Group B 
here,

1194
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,133
and then they decided to communicate.
Both of them have to go outside their 

1195
00:54:55,301 --> 00:54:59,440
group and meet in,
in the junction between the two groups,

1196
00:54:59,441 --> 00:55:02,410
which is a different place and they have
to make peace,

1197
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,250
but they make peace there under the 
guise of themselves as individual.

1198
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:07,093
It's exploratory individuals and then 
maybe the groups can integrate as a 

1199
00:55:09,641 --> 00:55:10,474
consequence of that and they've been 
without falling apart and without 

1200
00:55:14,201 --> 00:55:14,900
fighting.

1201
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:19,110
And if something appears like something 
will manifest itself as whatever is,

1202
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,810
is holding,
you know,

1203
00:55:20,811 --> 00:55:21,644
the two groups together,
the two families are the two people and 

1204
00:55:23,841 --> 00:55:25,430
so,
so that logos will,

1205
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:29,000
with the coming together,
let's say to families is a good example.

1206
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,710
You have two families,
uh,

1207
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:33,110
you know,
and then they and then people in the two

1208
00:55:33,111 --> 00:55:38,111
families intermarried and so there's 
something that unites them together,

1209
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:39,341
you know,
and,

1210
00:55:39,341 --> 00:55:44,341
and it's the coming together that,
that logos will appear and will hold,

1211
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,330
hold the relationships in place.

1212
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:51,770
That marriage is a recreation of that 
masculine feminine une.

1213
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:52,980
Yeah.
And that's,

1214
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:57,210
that's associated sometimes with the 
Androgyny of Christ in sometimes with.

1215
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,120
There's an old idea and I can't remember
where it comes from that,

1216
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:05,580
that Adam before eve was a for right?

1217
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:07,400
Yeah.
Or androgynous.

1218
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,950
You draw or Androgynous,
right?

1219
00:56:08,951 --> 00:56:09,784
And that Christ as the second Adam 
recreates that androgyny in the proper 

1220
00:56:14,021 --> 00:56:14,670
manner.

1221
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:15,590
Yeah.
No,

1222
00:56:15,591 --> 00:56:16,940
I think so.
I think that,

1223
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:18,023
that,
uh,

1224
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:19,190
there's a,
um,

1225
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,083
there are some use funded in some of the
church fathers where they'll say things 

1226
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:23,733
like,
just to help you to understand it and 

1227
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,260
understand it.
They'll say things that like,

1228
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:30,760
uh,
that God separated Adam and Eve,

1229
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:35,350
uh,
Adam into two in view of the fall,

1230
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,190
right in the sense that it wasn't the 
fall,

1231
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,860
but it was the idea that it had to,
it,

1232
00:56:41,861 --> 00:56:46,030
it has to do with the,
the idea of living outside the garden,

1233
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:46,521
let's say.
And,

1234
00:56:46,521 --> 00:56:47,230
and,
and,

1235
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:51,980
and having them to come back together 
and that coming back together in,

1236
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:56,320
in terms of sexual union and in terms of
procreation then is,

1237
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:59,350
becomes a little microcosm of what was 
in the garden,

1238
00:56:59,351 --> 00:57:00,650
let's say.
And so,

1239
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:02,290
and that's why also,
you know,

1240
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:02,860
like

1241
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:06,270
Adam and I wondered to what degree 
that's actually.

1242
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,133
Let's see.
I wouldn't say neurophysiologically 

1243
00:57:10,171 --> 00:57:12,270
true,
but I'm going to say something like that

1244
00:57:12,271 --> 00:57:15,510
because it seems to me,
and I made allusions to this when we did

1245
00:57:15,511 --> 00:57:16,344
that talk about logos meant people maybe
thought that it wasn't the most 

1246
00:57:19,201 --> 00:57:22,770
appropriate thing to say,
but sexual union produces this,

1247
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,010
this brief union in paradise.

1248
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:27,770
Yeah.
I think that that's.

1249
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:28,683
That's the highest,
that's the highest point of sexuality 

1250
00:57:31,161 --> 00:57:31,994
and that's why sexuality is used as an 
image for the Union of the soul with 

1251
00:57:36,351 --> 00:57:37,184
God,
and it's used as an image of the Union 

1252
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:42,740
of the church with Christ because the 
idea that that the unit,

1253
00:57:42,741 --> 00:57:46,820
that the Union of the masculine and the 
feminine is a glimpse of eternity.

1254
00:57:46,821 --> 00:57:47,654
It's a glimpse of.

1255
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:50,280
I'm not sure.
That's just an idea.

1256
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:52,030
Yeah.
I'm trying to think that that's.

1257
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,660
That actually happens.
Yeah.

1258
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:55,470
Yeah.
I think that it actually happened.

1259
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:56,383
Yeah,
I think so.

1260
00:57:57,330 --> 00:57:57,691
Yeah.
And,

1261
00:57:57,691 --> 00:57:58,830
and,
and that's why also,

1262
00:57:58,831 --> 00:58:00,480
I think that in,
in Christianity,

1263
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:04,800
the idea of taking that lightly,
it's very dangerous.

1264
00:58:04,801 --> 00:58:05,634
The idea of uniting yourself with with 
all kinds of people and is very 

1265
00:58:08,611 --> 00:58:11,880
dangerous because you,
when you unite yourself with someone,

1266
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,860
you're actually creating a very powerful
spiritual unity,

1267
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:17,903
you know,
and then if you kind of wonder that 

1268
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,153
shallow then,
right,

1269
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:23,221
you're,
yeah,

1270
00:58:23,221 --> 00:58:24,420
you're devaluing it.

1271
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:25,413
Yeah.
And it also will rip you apart because 

1272
00:58:26,411 --> 00:58:30,670
you leave a part of yourself with that 
other person and you leave a part of.

1273
00:58:30,671 --> 00:58:33,280
It's like you leave,
you're kind of still attached to someone

1274
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:35,530
and you're leaving a part of your soul,
whatever it was

1275
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:36,413
that person and they ripped apart.
So you ended up making it might say it 

1276
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:41,720
makes you cynical.
Yeah.

1277
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:42,773
Which I would say I think that sleeping 
with 100 women would leave you cynical 

1278
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,280
for sure.
I don't see how it couldn't turn it on.

1279
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:51,730
See how it went.
Yes.

1280
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,870
Yes.
Well that's the question.

1281
00:58:54,871 --> 00:58:56,970
Do I think that's a very good way of 
thinking about that?

1282
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,340
Yeah.
So we

1283
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:01,260
sleeve you in a,
in a position of,

1284
00:59:01,261 --> 00:59:02,340
uh,
of,

1285
00:59:02,341 --> 00:59:02,941
uh,
you know,

1286
00:59:02,941 --> 00:59:06,240
like the person who only eats caviar,
let's say,

1287
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:07,093
who,
who doesn't understand how precious 

1288
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:09,310
things are,
you know,

1289
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:12,180
and to not understand how precious 
things are as to devalue them.

1290
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:13,560
Like if you,
if you,

1291
00:59:13,561 --> 00:59:14,394
if you,

1292
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:17,330
if that's the highest thing that you're 
devaluing,

1293
00:59:17,331 --> 00:59:21,050
then you end up like Cain with Abel.
He kills Abel is highest,

1294
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:23,990
and then he says the punishment is more 
than he can bear.

1295
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:27,800
So if you take what actually is the 
highest value and devalue it,

1296
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,380
that you're left without hope.
Yeah,

1297
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,660
yeah,
yeah.

1298
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:33,800
No,
I mean,

1299
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,030
that's why.
That's why,

1300
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:36,500
I mean,
I don't know,

1301
00:59:36,501 --> 00:59:38,540
but it's like the people that I've known
in my life who,

1302
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:39,381
who,
who,

1303
00:59:39,381 --> 00:59:41,120
uh,
who sleep around a lot,

1304
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:45,560
they tend to,
to have a kind of nihilistic tendency,

1305
00:59:45,561 --> 00:59:49,350
let's say you have a tendency to not.
Yeah.

1306
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,960
Well,
things can be discarded.

1307
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:52,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

1308
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:52,771
And,
and,

1309
00:59:52,771 --> 00:59:53,604
uh,
and uh,

1310
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,550
and that moment of union,
let's say,

1311
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:59,420
is also pretty much devalued to just 
brief pleasure.

1312
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:02,540
That's the only way that it's 
conceptualized.

1313
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:03,983
You know what it is the case too,
that if you look at early promiscuity 

1314
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:07,843
and teenagers,
it's associated with antisocial 

1315
01:00:09,501 --> 01:00:10,334
behavior.

1316
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:12,163
Yeah.
It's a strong predictor or a strong 

1317
01:00:12,831 --> 01:00:15,230
correlate of anti social behavior.
Interesting.

1318
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:16,263
Yeah.
Now I'm not saying there was a causal 

1319
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,153
relationship there,
but I am saying it's part of the same 

1320
01:00:21,111 --> 01:00:23,150
constellation.
That's quite clear.

1321
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,140
So yeah.
Alright.

1322
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:29,410
Well that's probably enough of that.
Yeah.

1323
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,460
Yeah.
Okay.

1324
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:32,780
Okay.
Well that was good man.

1325
01:00:32,781 --> 01:00:35,390
I was thinking about these things when I
woke up this morning,

1326
01:00:35,391 --> 01:00:37,640
you know,
like for about an hour they were just

1327
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:43,520
around in my mind like crazy.
You've got that six.

1328
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:44,660
I did look on you.
I can,

1329
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:46,880
I can kind of discern it now.
Yeah,

1330
01:00:46,881 --> 01:00:48,010
well it's too much.
You know,

1331
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:48,973
it's too much is sort of thing really.
So it's like Christ I'd like to get up 

1332
01:00:54,741 --> 01:00:58,160
in the morning and think about raking 
the backyard or something like that.

1333
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:02,180
So.
Oh well that was really good.

1334
01:01:02,181 --> 01:01:05,840
Jonathan.
Take things that you think that's good.

1335
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:09,980
Like you think that we've got to what we
wanted to go farther than we have.

1336
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:13,640
If you,
if you want like think about it,

1337
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:14,663
I mean because we,
we had a whole bunch of things that we 

1338
01:01:16,281 --> 01:01:18,320
said we wanted to talk about.
Um,

1339
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:19,453
I mean maybe we could,
we could make it like a whatever every 

1340
01:01:22,341 --> 01:01:23,174
two months or every month or something.
So while I'm sure that all have the way 

1341
01:01:26,721 --> 01:01:27,554
my mind is working right now,
I'm sure that they'll have some ideas 

1342
01:01:30,351 --> 01:01:33,590
that you will be the right person to 
talk to about.

1343
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:34,583
So like I said,
I see you're one of these weird 

1344
01:01:36,981 --> 01:01:38,390
intersection people.
A,

1345
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:39,463
you're a Greek Orthodox rabbi,
wrote a French Canadian icon carver who 

1346
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:46,730
knows a lot about postmodernism.
It's like,

1347
01:01:46,731 --> 01:01:49,430
I think there's probably exactly one of 
you in the world.

1348
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:52,010
Pretty sure I'm pretty.
So

1349
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:57,230
that is why like I've always been a 
marginal person.

1350
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:00,400
That's why I understand it so well.
But I think that the,

1351
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:01,243
the key,
the key to my situation right now is 

1352
01:02:03,291 --> 01:02:04,850
that I,
I kind of saw it,

1353
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:09,260
but now I also see how it conserve the 
center,

1354
01:02:09,261 --> 01:02:11,840
let's say.
And so that's my job in life.

1355
01:02:11,841 --> 01:02:14,440
I think that's pretty much,
I think what I'm supposed to be.

1356
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:15,453
Well,
that's a good way of ending because the 

1357
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:19,910
postmodern claim,
the postmodern Neil Marx's claim is that

1358
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,753
the center should serve the margin,
but the counterclaim is the margin 

1359
01:02:24,601 --> 01:02:27,660
should serve the center and both those 
claims are right?

1360
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:28,973
Yeah,
and that's associated with that idea 

1361
01:02:30,301 --> 01:02:31,134
that you already described of of the 
image of Christ as the perfect man 

1362
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:36,270
saturating the entire hierarchy.

1363
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:37,800
Yeah.
No,

1364
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,633
I agree.
And the first will be the last and the 

1365
01:02:39,801 --> 01:02:40,634
last will be the first.
There's something about that in 

1366
01:02:41,871 --> 01:02:44,000
Christianity,
which is absolutely true,

1367
01:02:44,001 --> 01:02:46,490
that there that there is even something 
at.

1368
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:47,383
There's even something weird that 
happens at the end or at the bottom 

1369
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:51,163
where there's a mirror reflection 
between the bottom and the top where 

1370
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:56,840
like the lowest thing would be the fool 
for example,

1371
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:59,600
and the highest thing would be the holy 
fool,

1372
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:04,460
and so there's this strange completion 
that happens in the whole thing,

1373
01:03:04,461 --> 01:03:06,800
but it's really a very.
It becomes very mystical at that point.

1374
01:03:06,801 --> 01:03:09,260
It's hard to describe in in straight 
categories,

1375
01:03:09,261 --> 01:03:13,160
but the,
the marlow was kind of a good example of

1376
01:03:13,161 --> 01:03:16,520
that while I'm asking myself and asking 
myself that for months,

1377
01:03:16,521 --> 01:03:17,354
you know,
I did that interview with Dr Rachel and 

1378
01:03:19,431 --> 01:03:23,570
Brown about Milo and by the way,
she really liked.

1379
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:27,020
We'd like to talk to you anyways,
so that,

1380
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:29,890
that the thing I'm wondering about him 
is that in the,

1381
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:30,733
in the holy fool,
usually there's a lot of self 

1382
01:03:31,851 --> 01:03:34,750
depreciation and so St Francis,
you know,

1383
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:37,370
he would go out into the public space 
and strip naked,

1384
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:38,463
you know,
and he would,

1385
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,750
he would pass for a,
for a beggar and all those things.

1386
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:46,010
And so I think that that might be a 
requirement for the holy pool is,

1387
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:47,490
is that the,
the,

1388
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:48,020
the,
the,

1389
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:48,853
the humor is not only against the people
around them but also it turns back on 

1390
01:03:52,491 --> 01:03:55,190
themselves constantly.
And so that's what makes them,

1391
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,850
the holy fool is that,
is that you can't criticize them because

1392
01:03:58,851 --> 01:04:01,490
as,
as much as they're criticizing the ruler

1393
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,473
or the structure or the order,
it turns back on them and then they act 

1394
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:07,580
as the lowest of the low.
So there's,

1395
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,810
that's what is,
is,

1396
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:10,000
uh,
is able to hold them to,

1397
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:13,070
to hold them in that high place.
So something to think about.

1398
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:14,520
Okay.
Alright.

1399
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,280
Alright,
well I'm gonna cut the front of this off

1400
01:04:18,281 --> 01:04:20,230
maybe a little bit and then it's going 
to post it.

1401
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:21,120
So.
Alright,

1402
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,180
cool.
Alright.

1403
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,920
Alright,
good luck with everything.

1404
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:25,960
Yeah,
I've got another lecture tonight.

1405
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:28,840
Oh,
the electric end of Jacob's ladder.

1406
01:04:28,841 --> 01:04:29,674
Yeah.
Yeah.

1407
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:32,160
So now I have to go prepare that.
Huh?

1408
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,210
So wait,

1409
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:34,043
let me,
let me think about Jacob's ladder two 

1410
01:04:36,211 --> 01:04:39,660
seconds.
Did you ever watch that talk on,

1411
01:04:39,661 --> 01:04:40,494
on uh,
on Moses and the assent of my talk I 

1412
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:43,740
gave on the,
on,

1413
01:04:43,741 --> 01:04:44,850
uh,
on,

1414
01:04:44,851 --> 01:04:46,080
uh,
it's called,

1415
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:48,300
uh,
the life of Moses,

1416
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:49,970
Saint Gregory,
Saint Gregory of Nissan.

1417
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:52,740
The life of Moses.
You should watch that.

1418
01:04:52,741 --> 01:04:53,574
If you have time you should watch.
It's like it's like 45 minutes and it's 

1419
01:04:56,641 --> 01:05:00,630
really about the ascent of the mountain 
and the ascent up the holy ladder.

1420
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:04,230
Would you email that to me?
Yeah,

1421
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:06,810
I'll send you the link.
I'm completely out of brain.

1422
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,870
How send.
I'll send you the link right now,

1423
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:10,793
I think.
I think that might be helpful for you 

1424
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:14,430
for your talk tonight.
Can I get some rest?

1425
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:15,900
You'll get.
All right.

1426
01:05:15,901 --> 01:05:16,734
Bye.
Bye.
