1
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,580
So you're all wondering what your 
papers,

2
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:50,500
no doubt they are.
Mark do I have no,

3
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,873
um,
I'll leave the papers outside my office 

4
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:58,440
on my bench.
Hopefully tomorrow morning.

5
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,203
I am struck hypothesis about the 
relative value of things including the 

6
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:06,270
self and others.
But this might not make sense.

7
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,370
It's pretty complicated idea.
What pages are going,

8
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,330
don't you,
don't you have that memorized?

9
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,353
Yeah.

10
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,060
Anyways,
they're simpler.

11
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,100
One 31 30 middle of the first power.
Oh yes,

12
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:47,934
yes.
Okay.

13
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay.
So we haven't,

14
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,190
well,
things get complex here rapidly,

15
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:56,024
so that's what we're going to do at 
first a little bit is do some brick 

16
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:03,360
capitulation so everyone knows where we 
are before we go somewhere new.

17
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,513
I'm
trying to convince you of the notion 

18
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:14,490
that
when we model our experience,

19
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,680
we're coming up with two different kinds
of models,

20
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,620
which are usually conflated.
We don't,

21
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,610
we're not really clear about the 
difference between,

22
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,163
one is a map of fact and that map it's 
construction has construction of that 

23
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:35,970
map has been formalized as the 
scientific endeavor.

24
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,600
The map itself is the sum total of 
scientific knowledge.

25
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,920
Science is how we generate our knowledge
about.

26
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:46,710
Fact,
and I'm sort of in that fact,

27
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:47,544
is
consensually apprehensible phenomena or 

28
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:52,284
its pattern of transformation because 
science is not only interested in 

29
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,303
clarifying the nature of objects,
who also wants to be able to tell how 

30
00:02:58,801 --> 00:02:59,634
one object,
how an object changes into something 

31
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:01,990
else over time.

32
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,140
As Einstein pointed out in the quote 
that I

33
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,533
provided by him
were generally used to regarding that 

34
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,294
sort of phenomenon has real
Einstein wasn't a philosopher of 

35
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:20,674
science.
I think it was obviously a great 

36
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:23,584
scientist and at the very least his 
quotation who talks about the 

37
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:29,614
consensually validatable properties or 
things describes the manner in which 

38
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:35,410
people conduct science under normal 
circumstances.

39
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:36,244
That's what we think we're doing and 
there's a different kind of map and 

40
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,950
that's a map not of
fact about things,

41
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:49,030
but about what those things signify for 
behavior.

42
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:54,270
And I mean for motor output,
what they signify for what you should do

43
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:56,680
when you're around them,
when you encounter them.

44
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,510
And we don't really understand that map 
very well.

45
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,853
We don't naturally,
I don't think we naturally think of it 

46
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:05,854
as sort of a separable phenomena.
It strikes me that you can make a 

47
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:10,774
reasonable case that it's actually the 
type of map that proceeded the formal 

48
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,354
development of of science because we 
like animals are primarily concerned 

49
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:25,960
with how to act rather than with what is
in fact.

50
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,153
And if you understand that,
then you can answer some questions that 

51
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:33,610
otherwise remain somewhat mysterious.
For example,

52
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,660
how do you know when you're right about 
something and a fundamental basis,

53
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:42,070
you're never bragged about anything 
because wherever you look,

54
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:44,530
there's an infinite number of mysteries,
at least from the factions.

55
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,293
They tend not to disturb you.
And it is the case that we have placed 

56
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,603
implicit faith in the notion that we 
know things and that what we know is 

57
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:55,414
sufficient even though we know that what
we know isn't sufficient in the final 

58
00:04:58,181 --> 00:04:59,980
analysis,
not only is it wrong,

59
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:03,160
but it's sufficiently wrong.
So that over the course of centuries and

60
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:06,910
transformed itself into something that's
often even unrecognizable but it,

61
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,133
but it still strikes us as knowledge and
that's because I think we think we know 

62
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:13,564
something when acting on that knowledge.
We produce results that we want and 

63
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:17,464
that's sufficient.

64
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,700
If you get from point a to point b using
procedures,

65
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:22,534
see,
then you're convinced that you're right 

66
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,233
because that's it.
That's right enough and that's our 

67
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:30,600
criteria.
Antonio Damacio for example,

68
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,010
he just wrote a new book called 
Descartes' error,

69
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,470
big carts era being,
I think therefore I am.

70
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,663
It makes,
it was pointing out that people with 

71
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:41,920
damage to the prefrontal cortex start to
lose the ability to make decisions,

72
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:46,921
to decide between trivial things like 
when or to decide to reveal things.

73
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:47,974
Not necessarily just between like when 
you throw out old newspapers or which 

74
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:52,144
restaurant to to
you don't sum total all the facts about 

75
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,110
given a given restaurant and everything 
you can think about it and then contrast

76
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,360
that restaurant with all conceivable 
restaurants.

77
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,960
When you go up to eat the process,
it's pretty automatic and amaze.

78
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:08,370
You aren't used it.
We do it by recourse to emotion.

79
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:10,790
The frontal lobes help us determine what
our emotions are.

80
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:11,624
Say,
define it.

81
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,590
As a consequence.
We can eliminate vast swaths of material

82
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:18,950
that would just sort of clog up our 
cognitive faculties otherwise.

83
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:19,784
But the thing is,

84
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,783
okay,

85
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,080
knowing a little bit about how stories 
work,

86
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,633
how are we paused?
Our ideal futures and how we move 

87
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:27,644
towards them instantly gives you some 
insight into how it is that we 

88
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,124
determined that we actually know 
something and when we say we know 

89
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:34,634
something we basically need,
our knowledge is sufficient to get us 

90
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:39,860
from point a to point b.
And that's enough.

91
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,260
That's that that keeps us in the 
expected role.

92
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:44,094
It keeps our emotions regulated.
And I would say that the purpose of 

93
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:47,024
knowledge is to regulate emotion.
That's what you have at four so I mean 

94
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:55,580
you're always engaged in the endeavor to
increase.

95
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,670
Well,
this is right.

96
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,850
This is kind of a behaviorist way of 
looking at it,

97
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,950
but it's sufficiently accurate so that 
it's useful.

98
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,090
You want to live in a world where 
there's lots of hope for the future,

99
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,513
but where you're satisfied all in all,
or at least you're working to maximize 

100
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:11,714
your satisfaction,
you also want to avoid anxiety to the 

101
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,184
degree that that's possible within the 
context of maximizing hope and 

102
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:21,710
satisfaction.
And also this same goes for pain.

103
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,480
They're always trying to regulate your 
emotions.

104
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:24,314
In fact,
the reason we modify the external world 

105
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,343
is to regulate our emotions.
We tend to think that emotional 

106
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:32,750
regulation is actually a psychological 
processes,

107
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:33,890
right?
Calm down,

108
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,273
bring your cell phone under control.
That's only true in the most trivial of 

109
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:38,804
circumstances almost all the time.
What we do to regulate our emotions is 

110
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:47,741
to change things around us with our 
behavior so that we're satisfied more or

111
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:50,810
less with the manner in which our limbic
system is conducting itself,

112
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,790
motivates our behavior.

113
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,633
It kind of knowledge that you have that 
enables you to act so what you want 

114
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,280
appears,
I'd call that.

115
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,153
That's what we're,
that's what we're contrast on this 

116
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,490
class.
I guess the domain of pathology,

117
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,240
that's how wisdom is transmitted,
not factual knowledge.

118
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,150
Wisdom is how to act so that you get no 
one only.

119
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,190
It's not really so that you get what you
want it.

120
00:08:18,191 --> 00:08:19,024
That's a really simple way of looking at
it and saw that your emotions remain 

121
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,530
regulated,
stable over time in a situation and it's

122
00:08:26,531 --> 00:08:29,560
primarily composed of others who are 
doing the same thing.

123
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,890
Cool.
Who all have to act,

124
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:33,724
including you in a manner so that that 
stable regulation is flexible enough so 

125
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:40,060
that it can update itself wouldn't 
necessarily across time.

126
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,103
So there's a lot of constraints that 
have to be satisfied in order for your 

127
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:48,610
solution to the regulation of your 
emotions to be considered optimal.

128
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,160
When you talk about how to act in any 
given situation,

129
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,950
it sounds as if I only think of social

130
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,813
situations
I'm talking about because most of our 

131
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:00,954
environment is a social environment.
Most of what I consider my environment 

132
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:09,420
is is you and everyone else that I can 
offer.

133
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:19,620
You want to know how to ask as
well.

134
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,360
I would,
I would say look,

135
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,820
okay,
that's a perfectly reasonable question.

136
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,990
I would say wisdom is an abstraction of 
behavioral low,

137
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:27,843
so I wouldn't say necessarily,
but knowing how to open up the box of 

138
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:32,064
the computer and fix whatever particular
electronic park happens to be followed 

139
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:38,160
up constitutes wisdom.
But I would say that,

140
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,570
but usually what happens if your 
computer falls up is that you don't know

141
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:43,404
what to do.
But what you do know is how to figure 

142
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:45,534
out what to do.
And basically what you do when you're 

143
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:47,574
trying to fix a computer
based on the presumption that you can 

144
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,240
fix it,
which is like the presumption that leads

145
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:59,241
the whole behavior is to hold everything
constant and very one things,

146
00:09:59,300 --> 00:09:59,520
right?

147
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,630
You engage in a process of trial and 
error list.

148
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,600
That's the bonding towards solving the 
problem.

149
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:04,434
And I would say being able to engage in 
the maneuvers that allows you to 

150
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,960
generate the specific answer to the 
problem.

151
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:12,710
That's pretty much akin to wisdom.
So,

152
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,703
so I mean that's the computer,
it's a little different because the 

153
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:18,714
computers,
the computer computer is a bit peculiar 

154
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:25,350
though because it's an artificial 
environment in that it's it,

155
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,620
it isn't something I've infinite to 
flexibly in a sense,

156
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,980
at least at the level at which you want 
to interact with it.

157
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:32,814
It's a finite domain.
So a real standard set of problem 

158
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:39,960
solving techniques can be applied to it.
So yeah.

159
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,040
Yeah.
So the computer,

160
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,143
while the computer is probably the only 
part of the University of actually who 

161
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,150
works exactly as you predicted would 
from the scientific perspective.

162
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,703
So we will,
if there's not a lot of them remaining 

163
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,950
mystery.
So it was just the mirror you freeze.

164
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,510
Yeah.
The first time.

165
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,913
Especially if you're doing something at 
court and then you sort of fee then 

166
00:11:02,451 --> 00:11:06,540
don't you need a strategy to allay your 
anxieties,

167
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:10,140
which is calling the help number.
That's recourse to authority.

168
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:12,010
Yeah,
that's a comfort mode and promise all.

169
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,080
That's true.
That's true.

170
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,673
I would say I would still,
I would say that the process of 

171
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:25,950
generating solutions is more akin to 
wisdom than the actual,

172
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,900
their knowledge of any specific 
solution.

173
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,243
And that sort of without actually serves
as a good introduction to the internal 

174
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,810
things we want to talk about today.
Okay.

175
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,960
So anyways,
so I was,

176
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:35,794
I was summing up reiterating the 
distinction between the domain of myth 

177
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:44,370
and the domain of science making the 
additional point and that mythology is

178
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,823
both,
it's the story we tell about our wisdom 

179
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:49,314
and it's also our means of transmitting 
it basically in the same can be said 

180
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:56,991
about narratives in any sort of specific
examples of more general myths.

181
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,743
So,
um,

182
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,330
okay.
Well then,

183
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,000
okay,
the next question that pops up is before

184
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,730
the second,
the next question that pops up,

185
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:10,490
isn't it?
Well,

186
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,323
if you can,
you can conceive of the world as a 

187
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:14,830
collection of objects and that 
transformation,

188
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,220
but we're not doing that.
We're conceiving of the world as a place

189
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:21,520
to conduct action in.
And so then the next question is,

190
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,640
if you conceive of the world as a place 
in which to act,

191
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,043
what's the structure of it?
And it's strikes me that you can 

192
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,490
determine the structure by contrast and 
myths and seeing,

193
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,073
picking out their commonalities.
There's a bit more to it than that 

194
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:41,800
because there are creationists and 
creation myths explicitly statement.

195
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:45,070
What you're dealing with is a 
description of the genesis of the world.

196
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,700
So it's also a natural natural field of 
inquiry for mythologies.

197
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,220
And what I have been attempting to
describe,

198
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,320
it's my summary,
I guess,

199
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:04,321
of these various myths and the world 
that they portrayed and the mythological

200
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:07,600
world has basically has three 
constituent elements.

201
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:08,434
You could say four.
There's the chaos that precedes the 

202
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:11,554
construction of anything and that's 
representative as their gross has the 

203
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:20,161
dragon that eats its own tail as the 
winged serpent and the winged serpent is

204
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:23,110
similar [inaudible] a creature of 
spirit,

205
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,100
and that was the sky as the masculine 
world and a creature of matter.

206
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,510
That's the feminine world.

207
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,393
Masculine world has two aspects.
One is more akin to spirit speaking 

208
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:40,414
traditionally,
and the other is more akin to the 

209
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,770
patriarchal structure to the great 
father.

210
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,820
The masculine world is both the process 
by which knowledge is generated and that

211
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:52,870
dual image.
That's why,

212
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:57,190
for example,
in the Egyptian mythology that surrounds

213
00:13:57,191 --> 00:13:58,024
the Pharaoh,
the live pharaoh is simultaneously 

214
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,440
ocirus and horace.
Oh,

215
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:08,470
seriousness of Syrah stands for the 
state as a historical entity.

216
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:10,144
That's one way of looking at it.
And Horace stands for the process by 

217
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:16,900
which that state is updated and 
generated and the live pharaoh in so far

218
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:17,734
as he's doing his job is both the dead 
steak and the process by which the dead 

219
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:22,354
state is regenerating.
Remember when horace goes to the 

220
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:24,934
underworld to find his father was blind 
and living a sort of a semi vegetative 

221
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:30,070
life.
After he,

222
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,110
after you become seth,
by the way he gives him,

223
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,240
he gives him his eye and that brings 
them back up the surface,

224
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:38,074
so to speak.

225
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,940
Well,
now you know what that story means.

226
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:42,340
That's a very common story.
That's the myth of the rebirth.

227
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,890
That became basically part of the hero's
journey.

228
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,290
He saw a little bit of that echoed in 
Nokia.

229
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,130
Really kind of a peculiar place to find 
those serious and chorus.

230
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,660
I think if you think about,
it's kind of hard to figure out how that

231
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:57,240
might have come about unless you're 
willing to entertain them.

232
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,083
Like one consistent,
some of these images we're going to do 

233
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:03,560
get saved and passed around and all 
sorts of bizarre forums.

234
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,580
So Remember Pinocchio to be the true 
hero,

235
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,640
which meant to be real,
which meant to be born again.

236
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,493
He no,
he not only had to go into the belly of 

237
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:15,890
the whale,
that's the unknown your boroughs,

238
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:16,724
but he had to save his father,
couldn't just abandon it and save 

239
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:21,620
himself.
He had to bring the culture along with.

240
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,453
It does,
that's a really potent story if you 

241
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:24,854
think,
and obviously true sincere culture 

242
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:33,221
protects you to abandon it or to him to 
fail it when it needs help,

243
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:36,074
so to speak means to turn your back on 
precisely the thing that protects you 

244
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,503
from things that you understand so 
poorly that you don't even know they're 

245
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:48,550
there.
So I remember in the hall,

246
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:49,384
but this isn't the Hobbit,
it was very popping in the 60s I mean 

247
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:53,294
it's a myth.
The hobbit saw live in a kingdom that 

248
00:15:57,711 --> 00:16:01,820
it's threatened by vague forces from 
outside.

249
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:04,423
Their little people,
among them are large people who they 

250
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:09,884
call the striders and the strategy has 
looked like vagabonds and they patrol 

251
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:20,210
the perimeter of the hobbits kingdom,
sort of unknown to the hobbits,

252
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,233
but they're the mythical ancestors,
like the hobbits have a fair amount of 

253
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:28,460
contempt for them actually thinking of 
them as traps,

254
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,670
but they're actually the forces that 
keep the unknown.

255
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,030
The vague.
I've known at bay so thoroughly that the

256
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:37,610
hobbits don't even know that it's there 
really well.

257
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:39,230
That's the position that we're in.
I mean,

258
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:42,460
that's one of the things I want to 
convince you out,

259
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,930
so to speak.
In the commerce of this class,

260
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,310
there's the remnants of the old kingdom,
right?

261
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,440
And the remnants of the old kingdom.
Absolutely.

262
00:16:50,441 --> 00:16:54,470
They're the ancestral powers.
There are lots of cultures worship their

263
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,304
ancestors,
erect stone monuments to the for 

264
00:16:57,621 --> 00:17:01,880
example,
so they don't forget all the ancestors.

265
00:17:01,881 --> 00:17:04,550
It's easy for ancestors as well to turn 
into gods.

266
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,683
In fact,
that's what ancestors do over time is 

267
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,290
they turned into cost and we added 
points out,

268
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,750
for example,
that among our key people,

269
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:14,690
and that in this context means people 
without a written tradition,

270
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:17,090
when people who only transmit 
information orally,

271
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,193
historical events get transformed into 
mythological events when they pass out 

272
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:25,004
of living memory,
which is to say when the last person 

273
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,740
who's alive that remembers the event 
dies,

274
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:31,963
then that event is immediately in a 
sense remembered as an event that took 

275
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:41,981
place in the unspecified time that 
preceded the construction of the world.

276
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,333
And I think the reason for that is is 
that you don't want to burden your 

277
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:46,874
memory.
All you want to remember is the things 

278
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,034
that are important and we're talking 
about remembering things say over the 

279
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:52,554
course of 25,000 years,
all of the unnecessary information that 

280
00:17:56,251 --> 00:17:57,084
gets burdened away and all that's left 
is the core pattern of information that 

281
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:06,051
any historical event worthy of note 
necessarily contains when we consider an

282
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:08,850
event historical.
This is part of the reason why history,

283
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:09,684
so he sits on the boundary between 
pathology and science in a sense to 

284
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:17,241
consider an event worthy of historical 
note necessarily has to contain elements

285
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:18,714
of your own mythology because otherwise 
if it didn't contain an element of 

286
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:23,850
conquering the unknown,
for example,

287
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,163
we would never regarded as sufficiently 
valuable to even relegate to the domain 

288
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:29,334
of necessary fat.
This is troublesome for history because 

289
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,830
study of history is supposed to be 
formalized into Sam's.

290
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,240
This is a big,
big problem in history of generals.

291
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:46,640
Historical stories are told from within 
cultural perspectives.

292
00:18:46,641 --> 00:18:51,641
It would be awesome example of that is 
how you conceive of Columbus if you're a

293
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:53,094
European side.
Traditional York painting the standards 

294
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:55,934
story four years ago was no,
Columbus was a hero conquered new 

295
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:00,570
territory.
Columbus.

296
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:02,370
By the way,
this is a historical fact.

297
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,593
Columbus was in fact looking for 
paradise when he went out on his 

298
00:19:06,961 --> 00:19:09,840
missions.
That was his express motivation.

299
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,853
He thought like many people of his time,
that the paradise described in the Old 

300
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,463
Testament was an actual location on 
earth that perhaps could still be found 

301
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:20,874
somewhere.
Columbus hypothesized that paradise 

302
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:26,910
could be found in the domain of the 
unknown.

303
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:28,230
You never,
the medieval maps,

304
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:29,064
there's vaguely defined territory with 
terrible monsters surrounding and Love 

305
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:33,234
Columbus presume that paradise could be 
found in the domain of the unknown and 

306
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:36,774
now anyway,
conflating a mythological viewpoint of 

307
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:41,784
the world with with the actual word,
but it's very peculiar because of 

308
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:48,900
course,
even from the perspective of pure fact,

309
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:51,750
even though we wouldn't regard that has 
an accurate description,

310
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,033
it is the case from the mythological 
perspective that paradise still does 

311
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:56,574
reside out in the unknown because the 
only way you can ever get there is to 

312
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,730
explore it and constantly regenerate new
information.

313
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,920
So in a sense he was wrong,
but he was also,

314
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,443
he was also right.
It depends on your framework 

315
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,130
interpretation.
Anyways,

316
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:11,964
the problem is that reading of Columbus 
is necessarily in contrast with the 

317
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,480
reading of Columbus,
for example,

318
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:21,750
that might appear more natural to the 
North American Indians.

319
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,363
So it's hard to,
it's hard to figure out the appropriate 

320
00:20:26,731 --> 00:20:30,420
historical perspective or two.
And if you,

321
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,910
if you separate all the facts from the 
fiction so to speak,

322
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,223
the problem then becomes that the facts 
are dead and you end up in the position 

323
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:47,570
of having to memorize endless states and
lists of places that will learn,

324
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:53,170
embed themselves in your memory because 
they have no significance for behavioral

325
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:54,694
output,
which is what students need when they 

326
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:56,914
say,
why is it necessary for us to learn 

327
00:20:58,931 --> 00:21:00,910
this?
And this dude is then say,

328
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,700
for me,
this holds no intrinsic interest.

329
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:04,743
And they're saying because my limbic 
system is intelligent enough to 

330
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:07,894
discriminate between information that it
has the potential to impact my behavior 

331
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:16,180
or the way I framed the world and that 
which does not have that capacity.

332
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,253
And since I only have a limited time,
I should probably attend to what's 

333
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:20,524
important.
And generally what we mean by what is 

334
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:27,211
important is what will actually change 
the way we conduct ourselves if we learn

335
00:21:27,231 --> 00:21:28,064
it.
This is something that we seem to have 

336
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,483
either never quite figured out or 
forgotten or I think much of education 

337
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:34,983
is that the purpose of education,
the purpose of facts even is to aid the 

338
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:44,761
generation of wisdom and if it fails to 
produce that end then it's useless.

339
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:47,140
It's worse than useless,
it's just,

340
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:50,920
it's,
it's,

341
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,270
it's noise,
that's all.

342
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,333
So we don't have a formalized method for
the transmission of wisdom and we've 

343
00:21:58,001 --> 00:22:03,001
forgotten the domain in which it's 
transmitted and we know a lot about fact

344
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,440
is that another person's worst 
nightmare,

345
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:11,823
nightmare.
And different cultures share different 

346
00:22:13,481 --> 00:22:17,510
stories to such an extent that like one 
person can be seen as like

347
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:25,770
more cultures constantly at war,
each other every day has it.

348
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,560
The whole thing has become so did that 
we all recognize like one basic,

349
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,400
well I guess it depends on what you mean
by everyday.

350
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,760
I mean there's been more than 150 wars 
since the end of World War II.

351
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:43,550
So that's mean which we consider in a,
in a sentence the last war.

352
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:47,300
Well with certain exceptions,
Obviously Korea and Vietnam,

353
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,153
certainly large
conflicts of the sword you described do 

354
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:53,334
occur all the time.
And the other thing that needs to be 

355
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:56,524
taken into consideration is that wars 
can be conducted at many levels of 

356
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:01,570
analysis.
It's like one of the,

357
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:02,703
one of the
advantages to being able to abstract 

358
00:23:06,581 --> 00:23:11,581
ideas is that we can have a war that 
proceeds at the abstract,

359
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:16,420
that domain without unnecessarily 
unnecessarily degenerating into physical

360
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:17,254
conflict,
which means that there's at least the 

361
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:21,610
possibility that if you hold one in 
theological stamps,

362
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,623
which means that you ascribe one meaning
to an object and I ascribe another 

363
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:30,571
meeting that we can discuss it and fight
and conduct the war in words.

364
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,910
And as a consequence come to an 
agreement,

365
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:34,744
which I suppose might be considered the 
construction of annuity Ologie or doing 

366
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,933
the film without necessarily having to 
allow the process to cascade back down 

367
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:46,750
behavior where the we're forced 
determines.

368
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,720
Okay,
so what is peace then?

369
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:51,640
Like?
Like what is like,

370
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:52,474
it's just like a lack of social 
aggression like out now battling it out 

371
00:23:55,331 --> 00:23:56,164
with this.
Is that like are just like just 

372
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,373
contending ourselves,
didn't speak verbally at each other's 

373
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,680
throats?
Is that the best we can do?

374
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,063
Right.
Well that,

375
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,990
well that's a perfectly reasonable 
question.

376
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:06,824
I guess the question is what attitude 
most most essentially characterizes the 

377
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:12,830
attitude piece.

378
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,303
I saw one time when I was in Montreal 
and I saw a 19 year old guy standing on 

379
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:26,030
the street in an outdoor shopping mall.
Here's a big character,

380
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,043
tough luck.
You had a punk haircut and a leather 

381
00:24:29,811 --> 00:24:30,644
jacket and he was standing on the corner
holding your pink shopping bag full of 

382
00:24:36,261 --> 00:24:38,540
something.
I thought,

383
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,740
all right,
sorry.

384
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,573
He looked somewhat in the RV and I 
suspect that he thought he looked the 

385
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,114
same way holding this up
and I thought you look at someone like 

386
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:50,384
that will be aware of their capacity for
aggression on the outside of their skin 

387
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,033
where everyone can see it,
but there's no domain for its proper 

388
00:24:57,651 --> 00:24:58,484
expression.
So people in that situation ended up 

389
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:02,180
doing things that are essentially 
inserted,

390
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:03,014
like working in seven 11 for example,
standing up at quarter of a shopping 

391
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:08,620
mall to pink shopping bag in there.

392
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,493
Harrison,
what are the things that you might 

393
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,610
wonder under those circumstances is 
that,

394
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,270
is there any way that you could 
construct an attitude towards peace that

395
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:22,271
was sufficiently difficult and 
aggressive that it would satisfy someone

396
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:26,970
who's in that particular position?
We tend to think of on that

397
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,653
as a state,
as a default condition I suppose as the 

398
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:38,050
state then rains when nothing is 
necessarily happening.

399
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:39,883
Strikes me that in order to make peace 
and attractive proposition has to be 

400
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:44,834
demonstrated incontrovertibly in a sense
that it's actually a more dangerous and 

401
00:25:48,741 --> 00:25:49,574
interesting answer.
War War I think I understand now 

402
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,493
different perceptions of wisdom meaning 
like different ways of regulating 

403
00:26:04,571 --> 00:26:05,404
emotions and the fact that cultures 
regulate emotions know differently than 

404
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,330
many of the societies.
Yeah.

405
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:16,790
Maintain order and yeah,
they like the motions like I,

406
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,970
cause I was thinking about wisdom and I 
was like,

407
00:26:18,971 --> 00:26:20,800
well that's kind of a subjective term.

408
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,830
Like you may,
I think of your wisdom is dysfunctional,

409
00:26:23,831 --> 00:26:26,050
you know?
Whereas I think the mind is functioning,

410
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,960
handle things to regulate your emotions.
It may not be the truth,

411
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:31,843
the truth,
so it's an war being fought because of 

412
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,950
different in those are placed here.
Right,

413
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,350
and that's why.
Right.

414
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,330
Okay.
Okay.

415
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,633
I mean you can,
you can push the argument down a level 

416
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:42,234
of analysis even insane which basically 
the point of this particular quote that 

417
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,820
our maps determined in the meaning of 
objects in our,

418
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,350
in our spiritual field,
so to speak,

419
00:26:52,351 --> 00:26:53,184
and wherever there's a difference.
Wherever you presume that this object 

420
00:26:57,031 --> 00:26:59,180
has a different implication for your 
behavior,

421
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,950
what can I do or for our mutual 
behavior,

422
00:27:01,951 --> 00:27:02,784
love what's in its presence.
Then there's an unknown right there and 

423
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:11,511
there's also instant room for conflict 
because you can only do well.

424
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,593
This is not always the case,
but it's frequently the case that only 

425
00:27:14,851 --> 00:27:19,140
one set of behavioral outputs can be 
manifested in any particular situation.

426
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,060
That's certainly the case for an 
individual.

427
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,223
I mean that's why you have to solve your
problems is because you can't do two 

428
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:27,690
things at the same time.
You can only do one thing.

429
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:32,040
So
this is going back only long ways.

430
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,760
I'm curious that you
tend to refer to the domain of methods,

431
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,553
the men that we have forgotten because 
it seems to me that if we were to know 

432
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:45,750
it,
if we were to know it now,

433
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,630
we would know it in a way that we never 
could have known it before.

434
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,160
Yes,
it's not exactly,

435
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:52,620
I forgotten there was that.
It was now in a home.

436
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,563
It was the whole way in which we now 
know was built out of that and that's 

437
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,193
behind.
So it didn't do it because I never know 

438
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,190
how well I think that's,
that's a reasonable,

439
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,280
but that's a perfectly reasonable way of
looking at it.

440
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,800
Except I would say that there's one more
twist to that,

441
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:14,640
Matt,
is that at a defined time in the past,

442
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:17,520
and I would say starting approximately 
500 years ago,

443
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,050
when the scientific methodology really 
came into its own,

444
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,693
we made the mis attribution that we did 
in fact understand what we had never 

445
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:28,224
understood.
And not only that we didn't understand 

446
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:31,704
it,
but we understood it thoroughly enough 

447
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,473
to know that it was no longer a valid 
form of knowledge and that we could 

448
00:28:36,721 --> 00:28:37,554
safely discarded as superstition or as,
as a primitive form of science and move 

449
00:28:43,141 --> 00:28:43,974
into the future.
But it seems to me that there was never 

450
00:28:45,631 --> 00:28:46,740
a point at which we said,
well,

451
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:50,250
we said what we were doing and Ben was 
silliness.

452
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:52,290
And what we were doing now is the,
is the road,

453
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,320
uh,
to understand that.

454
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:56,860
All right,
thank you.

455
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:00,290
I have a real problem.
Jerry Hagen

456
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,440
and I borrow
your class.

457
00:29:11,441 --> 00:29:12,610
Go down.
It's just

458
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,073
objects.
You see as soon as you mess with the 

459
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:17,464
object,
because it's mapped in accordance with 

460
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:20,884
this mythological structure,
you instantly start to wreak havoc on 

461
00:29:26,021 --> 00:29:29,080
the whole structure that determines the 
appropriate,

462
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,093
the appropriate behavior of books.
So we know already what that structure 

463
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,080
inhibits.
It inhibits,

464
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,193
well,
one of the things that inhibits his 

465
00:29:36,911 --> 00:29:37,744
anxiety.
One of the things that you may have 

466
00:29:40,631 --> 00:29:43,300
found doing,
by the way,

467
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,613
when this unexpected occurrence,
the roads was doing something that 

468
00:29:48,701 --> 00:29:51,250
children do when they don't know what to
do,

469
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,990
which is called referencing.
Oh,

470
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,903
if a child does something unexpected,
say it drops a glass of milk on the 

471
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,254
floor,
the first thing it will do is look at 

472
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:02,374
its mother or whichever it all happens 
to be present because the unexpected is 

473
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,204
just revealed itself,
which is to say that an event that 

474
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:15,571
occurred contrary to plan emerge,
it's indeterminate insignificance,

475
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,910
although it evokes anxiety.

476
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:23,020
The fastest way to get rid of the 
anxieties to reference,

477
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,273
which is that you look at your parent 
and you watch your parents actions and 

478
00:30:27,431 --> 00:30:31,270
the parent's actions determined the 
actual significance of the event,

479
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:36,570
thus reducing its infinite significant.
So to speak to a definable category.

480
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,490
And what you have to understand for 
children is,

481
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:43,090
and I think this is true anyways,
even if the parent is angry,

482
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,710
the definite anger is better than the in
determinant significance.

483
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,880
Well,
children,

484
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:51,723
that's why children prefer order to 
chaos even if it's relatively straight 

485
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,980
door.
Anyways,

486
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,330
um,
set of questions.

487
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,050
So you're dying dominance hierarchy.
I don't know.

488
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,860
I don't understand what we were talking 
about.

489
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,260
You're talking about the,
the,

490
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,523
the,
um,

491
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,543
the meaning of the projector to you as 
opposed to the meaning of the projector 

492
00:31:08,771 --> 00:31:11,140
to him that had a conflict.
Absolutely.

493
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,243
No,
but not only the meaning of the 

494
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,390
projectors so to speak,
but everything that the,

495
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:21,340
the dispute implied say about relative 
importance of pursuit.

496
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,610
Like in an institution like this,
there's at least a,

497
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,620
um,
what would you say?

498
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:31,890
There's at least the theory of equality 
of access to certain things at,

499
00:31:32,211 --> 00:31:34,390
at any number of levels,
like access to audio,

500
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:35,610
visual equipment.
You know,

501
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,260
the fact that someone's been around here
longer than me,

502
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:39,094
for example,
it has no bearing in theory and in 

503
00:31:42,311 --> 00:31:46,990
actuality under almost all conditions on
their access to things like audio,

504
00:31:46,991 --> 00:31:49,570
visual equipment.
So when being comes in here and says,

505
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,543
you know,
despite what you're doing and the fact 

506
00:31:53,741 --> 00:31:56,740
that you followed the rules,
someone who's senior so to speak,

507
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,113
wants this and that's that.
So there's a lot of information in that 

508
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:02,854
sort of interaction about relative 
importance and not just relative 

509
00:32:07,451 --> 00:32:08,284
importance off of that projector,
but of the parties who were engaged in 

510
00:32:11,591 --> 00:32:15,310
negotiation for the projector anyways,
with regards to referencing,

511
00:32:15,311 --> 00:32:18,100
I was wondering like you can think back 
about your own reactions.

512
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,253
Do you look around,
did you look around when that was going 

513
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:25,120
on to see how other people responded and
because that's,

514
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,013
that's a way of coming up.
That's a way of trying to instantly 

515
00:32:28,331 --> 00:32:29,950
acquire consensus.
It's right.

516
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,350
What the Hell's going on?
I don't know.

517
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,050
Maybe some of these other people know 
all look at them.

518
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,020
I can tell by their facial reactions are
their patterns of behavior,

519
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:41,660
what this event might signify.
That's exploratory behavior.

520
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,300
You're exploring the environment but the
environment,

521
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,880
many cases is composed of other people.
In fact,

522
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:47,714
the most important part of the 
environment is composed of other people 

523
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:50,504
and when we have a map of the 
environment who were mapping is other 

524
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:56,660
people in relationship to herself and 
and vice versa.

525
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:57,883
So that's referencing you poached.
You pushed him like you wouldn't back 

526
00:33:01,391 --> 00:33:01,940
up.
I thought,

527
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,130
I mean you could have considered again 
in the fight as well.

528
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:04,963
That seems like that's the other,
that's the other purpose or the 

529
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:10,234
demonstration is that
if I have a map and you have a map and 

530
00:33:14,231 --> 00:33:18,250
they and they conflict with regards to a
particular object,

531
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:19,683
then which happens very frequently.
Then one of the things that's 

532
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:27,730
interesting to do is to consider the 
options for eliminating the conflict.

533
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,660
One option is to eliminate one of the 
conflicting parties.

534
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,820
I mean that's an option that's very 
helpful.

535
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:34,683
Commonly held when you buy.
What people generally do is they start 

536
00:33:37,361 --> 00:33:41,590
to negotiate verbally,
which basically means that they're using

537
00:33:41,591 --> 00:33:42,424
their verbal behavior to put their plan 
back into action to get what they want 

538
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,400
and as that's blocked saying it doesn't 
work,

539
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:49,923
more and more emotion builds up and 
other strategies but are sort of lower 

540
00:33:54,821 --> 00:33:59,470
on the access hierarchy.
Get thrown into play culminate possible.

541
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,870
Possibly.
What I wanted to get dean to do,

542
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,853
he was,
he was a little bit nervous I think 

543
00:34:03,701 --> 00:34:05,680
doing it because it's not part of his 
character.

544
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,790
I wanted him to take the project.
I was given him,

545
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:14,350
hold it and see if I could get someone 
to help me hold on the trait.

546
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,340
Now,
one of the things that we want to figure

547
00:34:18,341 --> 00:34:19,174
out is given the maps of meaning are 
going to conflict with regards to the 

548
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,233
importance of objects including in this 
notion of object including ourself and 

549
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:34,030
other people.
What's the appropriate strategy to adopt

550
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,373
in the process of negotiation,
which is very much related to your 

551
00:34:38,081 --> 00:34:39,100
question.
You said,

552
00:34:39,101 --> 00:34:43,750
well what constitutes say the essential 
aspects of peace?

553
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,063
Well,
what are the things you have to figure 

554
00:34:45,881 --> 00:34:46,714
out is when you're in unknown territory 
and you'd be put there by someone else 

555
00:34:49,661 --> 00:34:53,110
who's also there because of you,
what do you do?

556
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:57,310
How is it that you should act so that 
you're acting optimally,

557
00:34:57,311 --> 00:34:58,144
so to speak,
to resolve the problem in the most 

558
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:03,100
positive of ways.
Most causative of conceivable weights,

559
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,173
which is to say we need to figure out a 
set of rules that everyone can agree on 

560
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:12,160
for operating in the domain where there 
aren't any rules.

561
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,410
We cook a black Melvin cause I haven't 
want on tape.

562
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,840
Yes.
Yeah.

563
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,520
So we know,
you know it's culture aid as this story.

564
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:41,030
Culture B has this story and they meet
as soon as they meet the members of both

565
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:45,564
cultures are no longer in these stories.
They're in some domain in between and 

566
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:54,840
the rules that apply here and the rules 
that apply here do not apply here.

567
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:59,570
So kind of course the question is what 
rules apply here and well,

568
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,370
the other diagram that I'll keep showing
you,

569
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,330
somebody described it as the bouncing 
ball,

570
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:05,190
which is kind of a good way of 
describing it.

571
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,290
The rules that apply outside of the 
domain.

572
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:14,300
Here are the rules and that constituted 
the way that's the hero's path.

573
00:36:14,921 --> 00:36:18,030
So you would say that
the hero,

574
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,143
this is interesting,
this is why you get archetipal hero 

575
00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:22,734
figures.
There was really the ideal figures for 

576
00:36:24,421 --> 00:36:26,430
culture and they're also as a general 
rule,

577
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:28,940
representatives of peace,
sorry,

578
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,950
this is very,
very common food.

579
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,783
If for example,
the sort of the embodiment of pace and 

580
00:36:33,631 --> 00:36:37,500
the same thing is true for Christ.
It's because they are those,

581
00:36:37,501 --> 00:36:42,501
their patterns of behavior characterized
the optimal form of action that is to be

582
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:45,600
undertaken in the domain.
This between two specified domains.

583
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,913
Um,
I guess he came into our territory and 

584
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,730
were part of your culture.
All of that done.

585
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:59,340
I was just wondering in
general meeting,

586
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,140
wow,
what do you think,

587
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:06,550
what would happen if instead of just 
your map again,

588
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,760
pin on all of us.
Um,

589
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,653
the police stated a crucial meeting.
Well Danielle did a toss an insult 

590
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:23,060
adding mousy lab,
but this is something that you like,

591
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,333
I don't know how thoroughly you were 
taking in by this particular 

592
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:30,114
demonstration,
but one of the things that you have to 

593
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:34,060
try to,
um,

594
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,030
appreciate is,
you know,

595
00:37:36,031 --> 00:37:37,590
as,
as clearly as you can,

596
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,300
is just what were your responses during 
the,

597
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,353
during the interruption,
because this was the entrance of the 

598
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:47,430
stranger,
so to speak,

599
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,390
to hostile,
strange.

600
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,500
I mean,
he had his own agenda.

601
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:53,070
They weren't actually,
he wasn't really his agenda.

602
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:55,800
It was an agenda that he was acting out 
for someone else.

603
00:37:55,801 --> 00:37:58,860
So he's kind of in a sense just the 
emissary of bad news.

604
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,183
But this is a PC.
This is a pretty minor example of 

605
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,760
hierarchy disruption.
But you think,

606
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,830
for example,
had it mean real.

607
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,890
There's a,
well,

608
00:38:10,891 --> 00:38:13,530
one of the things that I was told before
I came to Harvard was it,

609
00:38:13,531 --> 00:38:14,364
there was a certain amount of tension 
between junior and senior faculty 

610
00:38:16,591 --> 00:38:17,424
members.
This is not nearly as true as I was led 

611
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:20,574
to believe before I got here.
And much of the distance that exists is 

612
00:38:24,061 --> 00:38:28,950
a function of age and,
and well in large part anyways,

613
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,143
but one of the things that this sort of 
disruption would do the me if it really 

614
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:34,704
happened,
would be to undermine my confidence in 

615
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:39,754
my position here and since I have 
devoted a lot of my life to attaining 

616
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:46,720
this particular position,
or at least that's how it's worked out,

617
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:52,020
that sort of objectively minor 
intervention could have,

618
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,453
you know,
all sorts of highly negative 

619
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:56,614
consequences in this case though 
wouldn't really have such consequences 

620
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:04,720
because of what,
what really made me think that this must

621
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:05,554
be,
this must be stage taking it to 

622
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:08,283
borehole.

623
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,620
Yeah.
Well that's okay.

624
00:39:10,621 --> 00:39:11,381
Okay.
That's a good,

625
00:39:11,381 --> 00:39:13,720
that's a good point.
That's part of it because I didn't,

626
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:17,170
Dean wasn't as forceful as I would've 
liked to have been on.

627
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:21,610
I actually asked him to come in here 
because he has natural politeness,

628
00:39:21,611 --> 00:39:23,860
overcame his acting ability.
Unfortunately,

629
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,470
I wanted him to come in here and just 
tell me what was happening,

630
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:30,880
you know,
more or less abruptly and just take it.

631
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,690
I was certainly,
I had made it,

632
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,030
made it fairly believable.
I mean that's true.

633
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,480
That's true.
Oh yeah.

634
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,433
We were all anxious,
but we're not anxious anymore because 

635
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:42,010
we've redefined what it means now.
We've right.

636
00:39:42,011 --> 00:39:45,260
And even before it was clear to everyone
in the room that it was staged.

637
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,250
Like as soon as he left,
he,

638
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,293
as soon as he left,
we started talking about it as an 

639
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:53,520
example.
So now everyone got what they wanted it.

640
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:58,000
I mean going with his story,
he got the projector and we took the,

641
00:39:58,001 --> 00:40:01,000
the event of having the projectors taken
from us to mean,

642
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,460
well great.
Now we have an example to talk about for

643
00:40:03,461 --> 00:40:04,294
a mile.
So kind of thing was a change card sort 

644
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:11,170
of rec revisionist history.
Even before I realized that,

645
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,570
we said as we started talking about,
I want a perfect example.

646
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,350
I was pretty sure it was stage because I
thought it would be highly inappropriate

647
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:23,590
for him to come.
Absolutely.

648
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,010
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

649
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:35,080
[inaudible] was the real situation.
That professor was in the lecture of 300

650
00:40:35,771 --> 00:40:38,110
people and had to have this machine and 
this was the only one.

651
00:40:38,111 --> 00:40:38,944
I don't think that would be,
that wouldn't be an unreasonable 

652
00:40:40,181 --> 00:40:41,470
situation.
Well,

653
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,690
no,
but the what is the more appropriate,

654
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:46,520
right,
exactly right.

655
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:51,360
He should have asked me brothers,
the room or equipment.

656
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,320
What does this mean?
Interest.

657
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,620
Why do you think it took you such a long
time?

658
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:59,320
Um,
yeah,

659
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:04,380
I probably do a piece together so,
so

660
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,570
sorry.
Somebody else again.

661
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,403
Tiny.
You think it took you such a long time 

662
00:41:12,311 --> 00:41:15,010
to la first?
The issue was you needed,

663
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,090
well that was at least that was my cover
story.

664
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,043
I mean the real issue is what the hell 
are you doing barging in here in front 

665
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:23,284
of my whole class,
taking this dam project or make me look 

666
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:26,524
like an idiot.
But the cover story is I need this 

667
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:31,990
projector to finish my class
anyways.

668
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,790
That's how it work out in reality I 
think.

669
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:39,883
Yes.
Okay.

670
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,510
We come back in.
Yeah.

671
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:47,150
I'll just call and tell him,
you know,

672
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:48,720
this,
this hoax day.

673
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,840
This is,
what is that?

674
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,500
Um,
well I don't remember.

675
00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:58,500
When did you leave?
Immediately afternoon.

676
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:03,130
That was a stage that was staged.
Yeah.

677
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,523
Okay.
Jerry Kagan and the basement using the 

678
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:10,970
overhead projector
to lecture class.

679
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,790
Oh,
well I asked him to come in here.

680
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,230
Do you have a dispute with me about the 
meaning of an origin?

681
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,160
So
unimportant

682
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:31,900
I stage [inaudible] classic example.
That's

683
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:45,510
right.
That's right.

684
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,363
Back to the most appropriate fantasy.
And the fantasy being an alternative 

685
00:42:49,011 --> 00:42:49,844
story where the motivational 
significance of things is the way that 

686
00:42:51,921 --> 00:42:56,921
you wish they would be
entertained by it.

687
00:42:56,961 --> 00:43:00,640
Because I was actually seeing if you 
would ask the same with,

688
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,880
you know,
that you've been telling us

689
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,100
and seeing if you would actually go 
through like it was cool to see,

690
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:12,830
like
in real life you would have had,

691
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:28,350
it
depends how you're approached the,

692
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,680
if the cover story is plausible and the 
emergency seems to justify,

693
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,573
well that's another,
and that's one of the things I've been 

694
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:49,721
trying to point out to the meaning of an
event depends on the behavioral strategy

695
00:43:49,911 --> 00:43:51,950
that you using the presence of the 
event.

696
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,170
So even with Dean,
for example,

697
00:43:54,171 --> 00:43:58,730
in his intervention,
it's the strategies that he used to,

698
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,103
uh,
to offer me the anomalous information 

699
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:07,210
aren't going to determine the phenomenon
that I am in that particular context.

700
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,293
So if he,
like if he would've called me outside 

701
00:44:09,651 --> 00:44:10,221
and say,
look,

702
00:44:10,221 --> 00:44:11,780
you know,
excuse me,

703
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:16,520
but here's the situation and it's a 
large context situation.

704
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:17,443
You know,
like let's say Kagan needed the 

705
00:44:18,501 --> 00:44:19,334
projector because
he was involved at some major 

706
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:23,894
fundraising episode for the,
for the department and it had broken 

707
00:44:26,841 --> 00:44:28,070
down suddenly,
et Cetera,

708
00:44:28,071 --> 00:44:28,904
et cetera.
Well then I'll basically what you're 

709
00:44:30,051 --> 00:44:34,530
doing under those is,
I can erase this now is

710
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,440
this idea,
alright,

711
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,600
little stories inside this is a 
dominance hierarchy by the way.

712
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,720
He thinks a lot.

713
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:02,830
He did.
Uh,

714
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:09,223
anyways,
so what gene would have to do in order 

715
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:12,414
to,
well dean would have to do in order to 

716
00:45:15,901 --> 00:45:19,980
convince me that his intrusion into my 
story was justified.

717
00:45:19,981 --> 00:45:20,814
Say My story of being at this level of 
analysis cause to make would be to make 

718
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:24,654
reference to a larger story of which I 
was also a part that I considered as 

719
00:45:29,851 --> 00:45:33,090
well as him super ordinate to the things
that were going on now.

720
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,860
So he would say,
yes,

721
00:45:34,861 --> 00:45:35,694
I know that this event has meaning a 
from the frame of reference of this 

722
00:45:41,191 --> 00:45:44,040
ongoing class.
But from frame of Reference v,

723
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:44,874
which you also share,
it has this alternative meaning we'll 

724
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:50,700
contrast the meanings and come to some 
sort of agreement about them.

725
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:51,391
And I'd say,
well,

726
00:45:51,391 --> 00:45:53,490
you know,
if I found his story convincing,

727
00:45:53,491 --> 00:45:54,324
I'm subordinate,
I'd altered this story because it would 

728
00:45:56,851 --> 00:45:57,684
be less motivationally challenging then 
for me to be engaged in altering the 

729
00:46:01,921 --> 00:46:03,860
superman story,
assuming they're shared.

730
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:05,273
So that's,
that's the kind of decisions you're 

731
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,850
always making.
If you're negotiating with someone,

732
00:46:08,851 --> 00:46:10,200
for example,
you do the same thing.

733
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:11,063
I mean,
what if I want something from you that 

734
00:46:12,271 --> 00:46:15,570
you don't want to give me,
I have to offer something to you that,

735
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:16,973
that is sufficiently important to 
counterbalance your laws or offer you 

736
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,470
the possibility of that in the future or
anyways.

737
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:28,520
That's okay.
Okay.

738
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:30,143
So yeah,
there were two things right after he 

739
00:46:32,341 --> 00:46:33,174
left.
Yeah.

740
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,260
Uh,
turning the [inaudible] into,

741
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,930
uh,
talking to beginning to talk about it as

742
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:41,620
an experiment or it changed the whole 
valence of the thing,

743
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,360
right.
Right away.

744
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:45,820
And the humor was also a part of that 
too.

745
00:46:45,821 --> 00:46:47,860
It became a source of humor at the same 
time.

746
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:52,870
And it was just interesting to watch 
whether everyone immediately saw that it

747
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:53,913
had been a hoax or not treating it as if
it had been treating it as an 

748
00:46:59,501 --> 00:47:00,334
experiment,
took away all the anxiety and the 

749
00:47:02,501 --> 00:47:03,334
negative energy attached to it and 
neutralize it and put it in this new 

750
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:06,853
site.
So

751
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,580
that is the instant provision of a 
story.

752
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,240
Yeah,
exactly.

753
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:11,871
Right.
And that,

754
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,970
that,
so you know,

755
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:13,873
that's a,
that's the classic demonstration of the 

756
00:47:16,371 --> 00:47:17,204
fact that the story is in fact what 
makes your emotions and you're always 

757
00:47:21,891 --> 00:47:24,260
trying to regulate your emotions in the 
face of the unknown,

758
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:26,600
so to speak.
So the,

759
00:47:26,601 --> 00:47:28,790
the notion of the humor is interesting 
too.

760
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:33,250
One of the mythological precursors of 
the figure of the,

761
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,173
of the savior,
which is sort of the archetype of the 

762
00:47:35,891 --> 00:47:38,260
hero is the trickster shrinks.
Right?

763
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:38,981
Right,
right.

764
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,410
The trickster is but bugs bunny for 
example,

765
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:44,020
that's his classic rule in,
in Warner brothers cartoons.

766
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,120
He always has a,
uh,

767
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:50,140
he always gives the events at twist 
negative events of twists that make them

768
00:47:50,141 --> 00:47:50,974
turn out right.
And the twist may not look exactly on 

769
00:47:53,051 --> 00:47:55,720
the straight and narrow window occurs.
But as the story unfolds,

770
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:57,190
it appears to be the right thing.

771
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:00,700
And trickster figures are very common 
figures in mythology,

772
00:48:00,701 --> 00:48:02,080
especially.
Okay.

773
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:02,993
Apparently at the stage of cultural 
development where the thicker of the 

774
00:48:05,861 --> 00:48:10,000
hero is really being elaborated up into 
something identifiable.

775
00:48:10,001 --> 00:48:12,550
So he's sort of a transition figure.
An adolescent,

776
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,350
you might say.
In a sense.

777
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:19,860
So the irony is to see that there's an 
ironic distance,

778
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:23,110
right?
I mean I'm in,

779
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:25,420
the humor is in a kind of an ironic 
distance,

780
00:48:25,421 --> 00:48:27,210
isn't it?
You know,

781
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,830
is it something that turns out to be not
what it seemed to be,

782
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:30,783
right.
I mean cause the trickster seems to be 

783
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,040
fit.
It turns out it's that.

784
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:36,040
And so there's a kind of double meaning.
But why,

785
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,830
you know,
I think we also find things humorous.

786
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,060
When did we become spontaneously aware 
that once again,

787
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:46,420
we've transcended a set of arbitrary 
limitations.

788
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:47,523
So I think keywill occurs at least in 
some instances when you move from a 

789
00:48:52,031 --> 00:48:56,080
bounded domain to outside the domain of 
that back and do another one because you

790
00:48:56,081 --> 00:48:56,914
have a fleeting,
you have a fleeting moment there where 

791
00:48:58,721 --> 00:49:00,430
you recognize your,
where are,

792
00:49:00,431 --> 00:49:04,240
you recognized yourself as sort of a 
transcendent figure and people find out,

793
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:07,130
well hey find that,
oh,

794
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,160
the word empowering springs to mind.

795
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,970
It's a word I particularly hate,
but

796
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:17,520
what I don't really understand is that 
my feeling in the sea,

797
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,740
which I didn't realize until the end of 
the stage,

798
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:22,420
which is great embarrassment.
You

799
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:23,970
okay?
Why were you bear?

800
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:26,120
Okay.
Why were you embarrassed for me?

801
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,043
See that's thoughts.

802
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:28,443
I think similar to what she said was 
that instead of like we sit here and we 

803
00:49:32,361 --> 00:49:33,194
listen to you as a professor and you 
then placed in the position of a 

804
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,300
bickering of a boy.
Right,

805
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,313
right.
And just be like your credibility with 

806
00:49:40,571 --> 00:49:42,110
seriously on the ride.
Right,

807
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:44,230
right.
And so it was Kinda like,

808
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:45,970
yes,
you see that,

809
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:46,803
like the phenomena.
I think the phenomena of embarrassment 

810
00:49:48,531 --> 00:49:50,720
is one of those things that all curves 
when you,

811
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,380
when you watch rabid movement down a 
dominance hierarchy,

812
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,870
like you sometimes in your own case for 
example,

813
00:49:56,871 --> 00:49:59,930
if you feel ashamed about something,
say you turned back,

814
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:00,773
well that's because you've just 
manifested a behavior which you know 

815
00:50:03,861 --> 00:50:04,694
full well is in very poor record with 
the way you conceptualize your position 

816
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:09,770
in a given Darwin,
sorry,

817
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:10,683
which basically means that you backed 
and blow yourself and that makes you 

818
00:50:13,491 --> 00:50:17,870
self conscious and also puts you out.
The other thing that happens under those

819
00:50:17,871 --> 00:50:22,871
circumstances is that like if you have 
adopted a story and it protects you,

820
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:27,500
the story has certain rules that you 
have to fall right.

821
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:29,413
And if you don't follow the rules,
then you immediately forfeit the 

822
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:35,330
protection of the story.
So if you're like high up in the story,

823
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:36,164
so to speak,
climbing up the dominance hierarchy 

824
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:40,580
that's associated with a particular 
story and you pull off of behavior,

825
00:50:40,581 --> 00:50:41,361
that's,
you know,

826
00:50:41,361 --> 00:50:43,070
it's tricky and it works,
but it's really,

827
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:43,933
uh,
it's immoral from your own perspective 

828
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:47,413
and you get self conscious and you've 
also exposed yourself to the unknown 

829
00:50:49,911 --> 00:50:52,250
there in a big way because you've just 
broken your own rules.

830
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,473
And the problem with writing your own 
rules is your rules are what protect 

831
00:50:55,881 --> 00:50:57,790
you.
So it's easy to,

832
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,770
if that's a good trick of cell cells 
from others and from,

833
00:51:00,771 --> 00:51:02,760
from the unknown in general.
I mean,

834
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,090
no matter where it,
where it manifests itself,

835
00:51:05,091 --> 00:51:05,960
right,
including inside,

836
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:07,190
inside yourself.
That's right.

837
00:51:07,191 --> 00:51:08,024
Because the story that you act out is 
how you ensure that you remain 

838
00:51:11,721 --> 00:51:12,554
predictable to yourself.
Which that's another thing that you 

839
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:16,600
don't want to underestimate the 
significance of this.

840
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:17,443
That what are the reasons for the shared
story is so that we don't have to have 

841
00:51:21,741 --> 00:51:22,574
fights about the projector and we have,
and that is dominance are determined by 

842
00:51:27,411 --> 00:51:29,150
dominance hierarchy.
Um,

843
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,793
it's also so that we don't reveal any of
our own mysteries to ourselves 

844
00:51:34,311 --> 00:51:35,144
unexpectedly.
It's not just to keep other people in 

845
00:51:37,131 --> 00:51:38,930
line.
It's also so that,

846
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:40,783
so that we can,
I think so we can tolerate looking at 

847
00:51:42,051 --> 00:51:43,010
ourselves in the mirror.

848
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,110
No,
not in any sort of horrific sense,

849
00:51:45,111 --> 00:51:45,944
but just as well.
It's comforting to consider yourself 

850
00:51:49,101 --> 00:51:51,320
with predictable entity even when in 
many,

851
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:52,663
in many ways that's an illusion.
There's because there's way more to you 

852
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:56,354
than you know about and you don't 
exhaust your possibilities when you're 

853
00:51:59,421 --> 00:52:00,254
participating in most stories.
I mean that's why if the context shifts 

854
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:06,500
well,
if the context shifts,

855
00:52:06,501 --> 00:52:09,780
your personality shifts because much of 
what you consider your personalities,

856
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,940
the story you acting out,
it said like if things really fall apart

857
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,073
when you,
you mentioned the small possibility for 

858
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:19,124
physical altercation here.
I mean you could say I would develop an 

859
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:25,190
argument and then there'd be a little 
physical dispute,

860
00:52:25,191 --> 00:52:30,191
maybe hydrive with the projector and so 
dean pull it and that would embarrass me

861
00:52:30,441 --> 00:52:31,274
more and that would make me angry and 
maybe I'd give it a push and he fall 

862
00:52:34,971 --> 00:52:35,900
over by accident.

863
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:38,330
And that would hurt them.
And that,

864
00:52:38,331 --> 00:52:39,164
you know,
it's just like the whole system spirals 

865
00:52:41,181 --> 00:52:43,410
out of control because of this one entry
point.

866
00:52:43,411 --> 00:52:44,244
And so then you say,
well you have grounds for the beginning 

867
00:52:46,491 --> 00:52:48,890
of a small war.
And the problem is,

868
00:52:48,891 --> 00:52:49,724
is that as soon as you're outside that 
the bounded domain where your emotions 

869
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:54,434
are regulated and controlled,
you're literally in the grip of forces 

870
00:52:57,711 --> 00:53:01,040
that you poorly understanding.
This regulates your aggression,

871
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:03,290
for example,
and predict predictability.

872
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:04,124
That's,
that's implicit in shared participation 

873
00:53:06,661 --> 00:53:08,810
in historic.
As soon as you step out here,

874
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:12,230
it's like there's all the gods of the 
unknown in a sense are waiting for you.

875
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:15,680
It's like you are now controlled by,
by anxiety.

876
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:20,750
To what degree depends on how much of 
your story has been disrupted.

877
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:21,883
The same thing goes,
goes for regression and emotions under 

878
00:53:25,561 --> 00:53:26,394
normal circumstances you don't feel you 
don't have a personality built up for 

879
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:30,983
because they just,
they're not part of your environment 

880
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:33,120
even though they're part of you.

881
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:34,461
So,
okay.

882
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:38,330
So the goal I guess,
of all our adaptation is to,

883
00:53:38,331 --> 00:53:40,010
to have our emotions regulated,
right?

884
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,610
Um,
but that gets disrupted by when,

885
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,140
when something anomalous comes in and 
there's always something anomalous.

886
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:46,243
However,
I like should we exist until the 

887
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:50,894
anomalous information comes in and hits 
us or because I sometimes feel myself 

888
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,053
just going for things that I'm afraid of
just because I want like the thrill of 

889
00:53:58,781 --> 00:54:03,070
whatever and but that is my searching 
for it and,

890
00:54:03,071 --> 00:54:04,670
and dysregulating my emotions.

891
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,553
What are the things that sort of 
complicates the idea that novelty is 

892
00:54:09,261 --> 00:54:11,900
threatening on first exposure is 
magnitude.

893
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,123
It's like,
cause it's not always true is that 

894
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:16,730
there's,
there's an optimal level of novelty.

895
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:22,400
Where are the magnitude of the event is 
sufficiently small.

896
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:26,330
So that once activated primarily is your
incentive reward systems.

897
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:29,360
And that's the sort of thing that if 
you're,

898
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,520
if you're operating optimally so to 
speak,

899
00:54:31,521 --> 00:54:32,354
you're,
you're consuming novelty at the rate 

900
00:54:35,001 --> 00:54:37,760
that's precisely appropriate for your 
particular temperament.

901
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:40,760
That's interest.
I think when people say,

902
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,820
I'm following my interest or I'm 
interested in this,

903
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:48,350
what they mean is there's an appropriate
amount of novelty in this,

904
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,970
in this area of my experiential field 
and I'm feasting on it,

905
00:54:52,971 --> 00:54:54,410
so to speak,
at my own rate.

906
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:59,730
But then you're aroused and while you're
optimally adapted at that point the same

907
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:00,583
because you're updating your models 
about adaptation and perhaps everyone 

908
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:04,490
else's as well.

909
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:08,470
Well at the same time remaining 
relatively secure.

910
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:09,770
C One,
one foot.

911
00:55:09,950 --> 00:55:12,010
Remember that I'll get you written.
Wait,

912
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,183
that's,
remember this diagram that's down the 

913
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,770
world.
The cosmos,

914
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:23,800
it's constructed of chaos
and order.

915
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:29,590
Too much of either is debney.
Your place is right here on the line.

916
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:32,810
That's the,
that's the razor's edge,

917
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:34,730
so to speak,
a very narrow line,

918
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:35,773
halfway between chaos and order where 
one is being transformed into the other 

919
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:42,910
but neither predominates and that's,
there's two translations for downs.

920
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:43,993
One is the way which is the path of life
and ask the bouncing ball diagram and 

921
00:55:47,421 --> 00:55:51,260
the other is meaning and that's because 
if you're on the path,

922
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:55,730
then your life has meaning and the 
meaning is contact with novelty.

923
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:59,570
At the appropriate rate.
So it's something you feed on that's the

924
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:02,300
source of the US,
that spiritual bread.

925
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:03,253
That's what that is.

926
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:05,263
I was just,
I was just thinking about this kind of 

927
00:56:06,141 --> 00:56:07,640
thing the other day and,
uh,

928
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,860
I can't remember,
I knew exactly what contexts,

929
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:10,993
contexts,
but it seems that they're all there 

930
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,030
instances all over our lives where there
is,

931
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,640
where we encountered islands here were a
novelty.

932
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,990
Novelty is,
uh,

933
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:21,260
actually a predictable part of our 
lives.

934
00:56:21,261 --> 00:56:24,020
And I think,
and what I just thought was that the

935
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,900
part of the administrator,
what you're talking about,

936
00:56:25,901 --> 00:56:28,720
chaos there,
where's there can be a bounded region of

937
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:29,620
unpredictability.
Yeah.

938
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,670
Yeah.
So that,

939
00:56:30,671 --> 00:56:31,504
you know,
everything in it so that everything in 

940
00:56:32,441 --> 00:56:33,274
there is unpredictable and number,
the lesson has very well defined 

941
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:36,590
boundaries so that you can,
they're,

942
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:37,480
they're whole,
they're all,

943
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:38,373
there's a whole,
there are whole classes of phenomenon 

944
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,500
that are completely unpredictable in and
of themselves.

945
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,010
Nonetheless,
you know what?

946
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,380
Right.
But nonetheless,

947
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:46,540
you know what their effects can be,
right?

948
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:47,374
You cannot be,
somebody wrote in the essay in this 

949
00:56:51,281 --> 00:56:52,114
class,
I believe this title in Games and Games 

950
00:56:53,771 --> 00:56:55,180
are new.
Example of exactly that.

951
00:56:55,490 --> 00:57:00,490
They're bounded domain in which novel 
events can nonetheless take place.

952
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:01,773
So if you mean when your emotional 
response to novelty depends on a number 

953
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:06,244
of things,
it's not,

954
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:09,070
it's not necessarily terror,
gay priority.

955
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:11,830
One of the things that hero myths tend 
to point out,

956
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,700
cause there's sort of two classes of 
romance.

957
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:14,613
There's a pyramid that describes the 
successful here and there's the hero 

958
00:57:17,951 --> 00:57:20,510
myth that describes the unsuccessful 
heroes like vehicle man.

959
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:25,540
And the unsuccessful hero is someone who
encounters the unknown accidentally.

960
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:29,300
So one of the things that transforms.
Yeah,

961
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,450
and he's the one who gets devoured and 
never comes back.

962
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:35,770
So that's what md did this by the way,
he accidentally slept with his mother,

963
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:38,080
his mother,
she's the great mother

964
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:41,770
that seems incest.
That's the incest motif.

965
00:57:41,771 --> 00:57:42,604
Now Freud read that sexually,
but really let the incest motif refers 

966
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:48,880
to is the possibility of creative union 
between the hero and the great mother,

967
00:57:48,881 --> 00:57:52,120
which is between the explorer and the 
source of all new information.

968
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:56,020
But the problem is if it's accidental,
well then it might kill you and eat it.

969
00:57:56,021 --> 00:57:57,400
This blinds himself,
right?

970
00:57:57,401 --> 00:58:01,440
His consciousness is destroyed because 
of this accidental encounter.

971
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:03,690
And Freud,
Freud thought that was the,

972
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:06,730
like the core story that underlied the 
development of humanity.

973
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,500
It's a very,
well,

974
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:11,800
it's a very,
depends on the level of analysis,

975
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,840
but if you know what that story means,
it's very,

976
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:17,170
very pessimistic.
That's it's a failed hero myth.

977
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:22,870
If you think of Freud Friday in 
psychoanalysis as a form of religion,

978
00:58:22,871 --> 00:58:23,704
which is,
which is a perfectly reasonable 

979
00:58:25,241 --> 00:58:28,960
supposition because Freud tried to 
provide people with a map of meaning was

980
00:58:28,961 --> 00:58:29,794
one of the few religions that I know of 
where the central hero is a failure nor 

981
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:34,803
success because almost all religions,
religions organized themselves around 

982
00:58:42,011 --> 00:58:43,450
successful heroes.
I mean,

983
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:48,480
that's why they were useful.
Substituting ordinary misery first.

984
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:53,320
Well,
it's also the case that Freud,

985
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:59,060
Freud explicitly presume that the domain
of culture associated with religion,

986
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:01,804
which is a broad domain and for which 
for Freud also included literature and 

987
00:59:04,751 --> 00:59:05,584
art was a defense mechanism and illusion
that defense mechanism erected against 

988
00:59:10,661 --> 00:59:12,640
death anxiety.
It was an illusion.

989
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:13,923
One way.
That's true.

990
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,340
Well,
it can be true,

991
00:59:15,341 --> 00:59:16,174
but it doesn't have to be true dogma.
It's true that no one serves to protect 

992
00:59:19,901 --> 00:59:21,100
you from the right.
Right.

993
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:22,003
Look,
there's nothing trivial about Freud's 

994
00:59:23,391 --> 00:59:24,224
objection and it's also the case that 
people hide inside Reggie dv Ologies 

995
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,220
precisely in order to protect themselves
from not just death,

996
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:33,950
but from the all those things they don't
understand.

997
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:34,993
But the fact that something can be true,
it doesn't necessarily mean that it is 

998
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:39,560
true or that it's true in all cases.

999
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,333
Um,
last week you had mentioned positive 

1000
00:59:43,261 --> 00:59:48,261
delusion and how there was a literature 
that that implies healthy to have some,

1001
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,073
was the illusion

1002
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,960
that is being debunked at this time?

1003
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:52,791
Well,
there's,

1004
00:59:52,791 --> 00:59:54,050
there's a big debate about it,
but,

1005
00:59:54,051 --> 00:59:54,190
yeah.

1006
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,040
All right,
well just,

1007
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:58,100
just thinking about,
okay,

1008
00:59:58,101 --> 01:00:00,050
what have you,
what if your way,

1009
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:02,930
what if your path to get from,
you know,

1010
01:00:02,931 --> 01:00:07,190
the unbearable present to your future 
goal included?

1011
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I'm thinking of the unknown or 
intrusions from the unknown as lessons.

1012
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:14,983
So in other words,
you were looking at them as a positive 

1013
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:18,470
every,
every time.

1014
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:20,510
Um,
anomalous information came to you.

1015
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,553
You said,
this has been brought to me to teach me 

1016
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:24,510
a lesson,
right?

1017
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:25,363
We'll learn something.
And that would take the anxiety away 

1018
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:28,124
from it?

1019
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:31,540
Well,
no,

1020
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:32,430
this yeses.
Okay.

1021
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:36,600
That's a perfectly interesting argument.
The last part of it,

1022
01:00:36,601 --> 01:00:37,434
I think,
I don't think you have to classify that 

1023
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:40,310
as a positive allusion.
Um,

1024
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:44,790
I think that the transition in western 
culture from Old Testament,

1025
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,033
uh,
morality to do testament reality is a 

1026
01:00:48,241 --> 01:00:51,210
transition of exactly that sort because 
the message,

1027
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,250
it's sort of implicit in the Old 
Testament.

1028
01:00:53,251 --> 01:00:55,140
God is a pretty horrible figure.
I mean,

1029
01:00:55,141 --> 01:00:56,870
very powerful,
but quite frightening.

1030
01:00:56,970 --> 01:01:00,360
And how's it and 10 constantly displayed
in that manner.

1031
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,370
And God,
that's new testament.

1032
01:01:02,371 --> 01:01:05,970
Just theoretically God love.
At least that's the attitude that you're

1033
01:01:05,971 --> 01:01:08,190
supposed to.
How and why is that?

1034
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,473
Well,
it's for the reasons that you just 

1035
01:01:10,171 --> 01:01:13,380
pointed out is the content of the time.
No one is inevitable.

1036
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:17,090
The only thing you can do about it and 
just change your attitude to it.

1037
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:23,070
The hero myth 10 to point out that if 
you approach it voluntarily,

1038
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,870
it's the source of new information.

1039
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:26,730
If you run from it,
it kills you.

1040
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:28,200
Oh,
those are your options.

1041
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:32,160
Your option isn't too to not happen.
If things didn't change,

1042
01:01:32,161 --> 01:01:32,994
there wouldn't be any light,
but you do have the option of how to 

1043
01:01:35,401 --> 01:01:36,234
face it and it does work.
I mean if you're in getting engaged in 

1044
01:01:38,551 --> 01:01:39,384
an argument with somebody,
like somebody that you have to argue 

1045
01:01:41,791 --> 01:01:43,710
with and that you have to come to a 
solution with,

1046
01:01:43,711 --> 01:01:46,080
say someone you're married to,
someone in your family,

1047
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:48,770
it's like you have to solve the problem 
or an or not.

1048
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:50,580
You can just fight about it for the rest
of your life.

1049
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:51,414
That's the other option.
Fighting about it a few times in the 

1050
01:01:53,011 --> 01:01:55,590
rest of your life if you actually have 
to address it.

1051
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,060
Then when they present you with 
anomalous information,

1052
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:02,370
which is essentially like a poison 
apple,

1053
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:05,610
something that's an adjustable in its 
present form,

1054
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:06,653
your only option is to sit and think 
what is there in this that I can 

1055
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,230
actually constitutes usable information 
for me.

1056
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,770
So you might say someone's objecting to 
the way you conduct yourself.

1057
01:02:16,771 --> 01:02:17,604
Do you think that they're being hostile 
and unfair but laid down some ground 

1058
01:02:20,071 --> 01:02:21,720
rules so you more or less trust each 
other?

1059
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:22,883
You're only option.
There's no circumstance cause is to 

1060
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:29,310
remove yourself from the argument 
symbolically Europe or in actuality,

1061
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:33,430
is there any truth in the information 
I'm getting Andy?

1062
01:02:33,431 --> 01:02:36,060
If so,
how?

1063
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:40,710
How do I have to adjust my behavior or 
my scheme of interpretation to take that

1064
01:02:40,711 --> 01:02:44,400
information into account?
That's presuming that what you want from

1065
01:02:44,401 --> 01:02:45,234
the argument is the reestablishment of 
harmony and the capacity to continue to 

1066
01:02:49,141 --> 01:02:51,320
move forward.
So that is the attitude that you,

1067
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:53,460
I don't think that's a positive allusion
at all because

1068
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:55,853
the way things manifest themselves is 
dependent on your attitude towards them 

1069
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:02,100
in a nontrivial way.
It's like you in in a,

1070
01:03:02,101 --> 01:03:06,820
in a major way.
You determined the Valence of phenomenal

1071
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,590
by your approach to them and we don't 
know the limits of that.

1072
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:11,783
Okay,
so you're saying basically then before 

1073
01:03:13,561 --> 01:03:15,600
the hero can venture out into the 
unknown,

1074
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:16,523
he has to take care of the anxiety right
before he can do the exploratory 

1075
01:03:19,771 --> 01:03:20,260
behavior?

1076
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:20,711
Well,
no,

1077
01:03:20,711 --> 01:03:22,550
not necessarily he,
but no,

1078
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,393
no,
I wouldn't say that because the anxiety 

1079
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:26,540
might accompany the exploratory 
behavior.

1080
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:28,380
It often does.
I would just say what,

1081
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:32,470
what the hero posits this.
This goes back to your point about,

1082
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:37,500
uh,
last week about how the transference and

1083
01:03:38,111 --> 01:03:38,944
union psychoanalysis,
what the hero has to do implicitly or 

1084
01:03:42,311 --> 01:03:46,510
explicitly is pause at his site or what,
what the individual has to be.

1085
01:03:46,511 --> 01:03:47,344
We implicitly or explicitly is positive.
His identity with the hero as a 

1086
01:03:50,501 --> 01:03:51,334
potential fat who's validity can only be
tested as a consequence of actual 

1087
01:03:56,471 --> 01:03:59,470
action,
which is to say you have a Schema.

1088
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:02,170
Some anomalous information comes in,
you have a choice,

1089
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:06,670
act on it or not.
If you decide to act on what you've done

1090
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:10,540
implicitly is identify with the hero.
So that's an act of faith.

1091
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:11,573
And that act of faith is that despite 
the way the anomalous information 

1092
01:04:15,581 --> 01:04:19,900
appears and it's destructive context,
there's something within me that I don't

1093
01:04:19,901 --> 01:04:23,440
know about that will enable me to cope 
with it if I make the effort.

1094
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:27,190
It has to be faint because?
Because it's enormous.

1095
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:29,910
You don't,
you can't know low.

1096
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:31,930
Okay.
Now you made,

1097
01:04:31,931 --> 01:04:32,830
you made a,
uh,

1098
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:33,843
when you,
when you talked about the rate of a 

1099
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:38,630
known being related to temperament.
Yeah.

1100
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:39,503
Um,
what,

1101
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,353
what do,
what temperament do you think the ideal 

1102
01:04:41,591 --> 01:04:42,424
here?
What would happen?

1103
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:44,020
I don't think it matters.
It doesn't matter.

1104
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:47,830
It doesn't matter because,
because it's a subjective phenomenon.

1105
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:50,890
It's like,
it's the same with intelligence.

1106
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:54,220
You could say for someone who is 
profoundly retarded,

1107
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:59,680
learning how to tie their shoes might be
regarded as a heroic act and justly soul

1108
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:00,603
from the perspective of morality.
And because they had to overcome what 

1109
01:05:03,911 --> 01:05:08,070
were innumerable subjective obstacles.
So timber bent or intelligence or native

1110
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:10,420
ability does it,
this is a level playing field.

1111
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:11,283
It doesn't demand,
it doesn't determine that that a person 

1112
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:14,920
can be a hero.
However,

1113
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:16,870
you might say that there are different 
kinds of heroes.

1114
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:20,140
There's there could be here with that 
ties his shoes or the hero that brings,

1115
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:21,310
um,
you know,

1116
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:22,560
uh,
that,

1117
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:26,470
that takes America to a different place.
Whatever the Mesoamericans do,

1118
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:27,940
leave that,
that Schamens,

1119
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,910
um,
had stronger temperaments and they were,

1120
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:34,090
they were seen as basically the heroes 
and you know,

1121
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:35,710
they could go into there,
there,

1122
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:36,260
there,
there,

1123
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:37,770
there,
there were more passionate and that.

1124
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,940
So it seems to me that there is a 
difference between,

1125
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:43,350
I want to read you something just to 
move because it's such a good design.

1126
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:44,613
This is really interesting.
It's very relevant to your question 

1127
01:05:46,721 --> 01:05:49,540
about levels of heroism,
so to speak.

1128
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:52,090
Okay.
This is an Indian doctor,

1129
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:55,330
doctors of cosmic cycles.
Okay.

1130
01:05:55,331 --> 01:05:57,910
I want you to think about with regards 
to this,

1131
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,313
to this diag riffle right now we know 
already that this is a kind of a 

1132
01:06:06,161 --> 01:06:06,994
schematic representation of a story with
all these other stories embedded within 

1133
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:13,600
it and they organize themselves over 
time.

1134
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:17,530
It's a dominance hierarchy because the 
most dominant story,

1135
01:06:17,531 --> 01:06:20,260
so to speak,
occupies superordinate territory.

1136
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:21,513
So if you're in a dominance hierarchy,
the most powerful person determines the 

1137
01:06:24,251 --> 01:06:28,210
story that has the greatest domain.
And it is the case.

1138
01:06:28,211 --> 01:06:29,920
I'll read you some examples of this 
suit.

1139
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:31,023
That time.
The story of dominance disputes between 

1140
01:06:34,001 --> 01:06:36,070
the gods are very,
very common,

1141
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:36,933
mythological,
mythological tales about talk about the 

1142
01:06:40,481 --> 01:06:42,370
movement towards monotheism.
For example.

1143
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:43,713
The guards are,
are very often portrayed as at war and 

1144
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:50,340
it's the victorious God that becomes the
Supreme God.

1145
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:51,423
I think that's a mythological 
representation of the fact that those 

1146
01:06:55,181 --> 01:06:57,460
processes actually occur in time on 
earth.

1147
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:59,020
We,
we dispute,

1148
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:01,660
we dispute constantly the meaning of 
things,

1149
01:07:01,661 --> 01:07:03,700
relative meaning of things and over 
time,

1150
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,780
at least within cultures,
we come to agreement about that.

1151
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,790
That means that some positions when 
another positions lose it.

1152
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:14,320
That's a Darwinian competition of ideas,
although sometimes it's cooperatively,

1153
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:16,720
cooperatively induced as well.

1154
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:18,580
Anyways,
these are stories.

1155
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:23,260
We know that stories too,
that when they transformed themselves,

1156
01:07:23,261 --> 01:07:26,230
they go through this cycle of 
dissolution and reconstruction.

1157
01:07:26,231 --> 01:07:31,231
So you could say that if this is the 
arrangement of stories at every level of

1158
01:07:33,011 --> 01:07:33,844
analysis,
each of these separate stories is 

1159
01:07:35,621 --> 01:07:38,980
constantly undergoing dissolution and 
reconstruction.

1160
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:41,680
So that's happening all the way up the 
chain.

1161
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:43,870
I listen to this.
This is really interesting.

1162
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:47,740
The doctrine of cosmic cycles from 
India.

1163
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:51,610
A complete cycle you got comprises 
12,000 years.

1164
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:54,070
It ends with the disillusion of her 
mayor,

1165
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:55,143
which is repeated more drastically.
Matt have per layer the great 

1166
01:07:57,611 --> 01:08:02,611
disillusion at the end of the thousand 
cycle for the paradigmatic Schema,

1167
01:08:03,251 --> 01:08:04,540
creation,
destruction,

1168
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:07,550
creation,
etc. Is reproduced an infinitive.

1169
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:09,453
The 12,000 years of the Bahai Yoga were 
regarded as divine years each with a 

1170
01:08:12,491 --> 01:08:16,280
duration of 360 years,
which gives a total of 4 million,

1171
01:08:16,281 --> 01:08:20,980
320,000 years for a single cosmic cycle.
1,000 such Matt,

1172
01:08:20,981 --> 01:08:21,230
how are you?

1173
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:24,740
This makes up a KALPA 14 culpas makeup,
a man,

1174
01:08:24,741 --> 01:08:25,574
Vera.
Then Tara so named because each 

1175
01:08:27,921 --> 01:08:28,754
Manvantara,
it's supposed to be ruled by man who's 

1176
01:08:31,311 --> 01:08:33,710
the mythical ancestor king.
Okay,

1177
01:08:33,711 --> 01:08:38,140
so one of the implications of this is 
that the cyclical or that

1178
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:44,630
if you pick a domain of this cyclical 
process,

1179
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:49,340
you can ascribe its establishment to the
mythical ancestor king.

1180
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:53,870
Okay?
Kaaba is equivalent to a day in the life

1181
01:08:53,871 --> 01:08:56,180
of Brahma,
a second cup or two a night,

1182
01:08:56,350 --> 01:08:58,940
a hundred of these years of Brahma.
In other words,

1183
01:08:58,941 --> 01:08:59,774
311 millions of human 311,000 millions 
of human years constitutes the life of 

1184
01:09:04,761 --> 01:09:05,594
Brahma.
But even this duration of the God's 

1185
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:09,120
life,
there's not exhaust time.

1186
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:10,483
The guards are not eternal on the cosmic
creations and destruction succeed each 

1187
01:09:13,791 --> 01:09:14,624
other forever.
So the Indian notion is that this is 

1188
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:20,960
kind of an infinite,
this thing is infinite and structure all

1189
01:09:20,961 --> 01:09:23,570
the way up as far as you can go in all 
the way down as far as you can go in.

1190
01:09:23,571 --> 01:09:24,404
And every level of analysis,
there's these constant cycles of 

1191
01:09:26,601 --> 01:09:30,620
creation and destruction.
That sounds almost like alchemy.

1192
01:09:30,621 --> 01:09:31,454
I mean it's sort of a very,
it's a way of playing messiah with the 

1193
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:37,470
symbols and the way that scientific 
sounding way.

1194
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

1195
01:09:38,451 --> 01:09:40,080
Well they know,
oh,

1196
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:44,720
people had scientific intuitions prior 
to the,

1197
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:46,003
to the onset of science as a formal 
enterprise as well as mythological 

1198
01:09:48,801 --> 01:09:50,490
intuitions.
Oh,

1199
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:51,171
this,
this,

1200
01:09:51,171 --> 01:09:52,004
this dark.
Turn this off I think is obviously 

1201
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:56,450
representing something like this.
So

1202
01:09:58,420 --> 01:09:58,940
the,
uh,

1203
01:09:58,940 --> 01:09:59,773
you mentioned earlier that the dominance
hierarchies are this way and for some 

1204
01:10:03,591 --> 01:10:05,090
reason that doesn't,
it doesn't make sense.

1205
01:10:05,091 --> 01:10:05,870
In my head,
um,

1206
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:06,561
because it's,
it's,

1207
01:10:06,561 --> 01:10:08,720
he would seem to me that,
that they'd go,

1208
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:10,640
um,
instead of going up there,

1209
01:10:10,641 --> 01:10:12,650
they are within each other.
So if,

1210
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:13,543
if,
if Sean came in and say you have one of 

1211
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,280
the,
the three right there,

1212
01:10:16,281 --> 01:10:17,360
the little ones right there.
You,

1213
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:18,860
you both had,
uh,

1214
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:19,800
a story there,
but he,

1215
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,610
he gave you a bigger story.
Yeah.

1216
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:22,693
Then that would change.
That would change yours instead of 

1217
01:10:24,441 --> 01:10:25,274
looking at it as going up there,
I would look at it as judged as being 

1218
01:10:27,651 --> 01:10:29,920
different and he has to give you one 
that incumbent.

1219
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:30,630
Yeah,
but,

1220
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:32,670
but I would say that's a more dominant 
story.

1221
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,820
It contains more territory.
It rules more territory.

1222
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:36,930
That's,
that's the notion.

1223
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:37,853
Literally it rules more territory.
So I'd be willing to subordinate my 

1224
01:10:40,621 --> 01:10:43,440
story to this large,
the largest story,

1225
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:45,900
say for the Mesopotamians that's ruled 
by Martech.

1226
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:47,640
So you see there's a real neat twist in 
this.

1227
01:10:47,641 --> 01:10:48,474
I think it's really something else.
So it's like you have a real paradox is 

1228
01:10:51,151 --> 01:10:55,980
that you need known territory to protect
yourself from chaos.

1229
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,560
But the problem with that is known 
territory has,

1230
01:10:58,561 --> 01:10:59,910
it has real disadvantages,
right?

1231
01:10:59,911 --> 01:11:01,560
It gets rigid.
That's one thing.

1232
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:02,633
And it makes you have conflicts with 
other people who have no territories 

1233
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:07,480
that are different,
different way the Mesopotamians solve.

1234
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:11,940
This was by saying that the thing that 
makes the superordinate story,

1235
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:13,133
which is Marta,
is actually the process that transforms 

1236
01:11:15,451 --> 01:11:16,830
all stories,
right?

1237
01:11:16,831 --> 01:11:21,831
So they put a paradoxical loop into this
process I suppose.

1238
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:24,190
Absolutely brilliant,
brilliant.

1239
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:24,781
We say,
well,

1240
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:25,614
all your,
all your conditional stories have to be 

1241
01:11:27,721 --> 01:11:28,554
dependent,
have to always remain dependent on your 

1242
01:11:30,751 --> 01:11:34,530
ultimate subordination,
to the process by which all conditionals

1243
01:11:34,531 --> 01:11:38,160
towards from generate.
So that's an amazing idea.

1244
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:39,780
So,
so I,

1245
01:11:39,781 --> 01:11:41,440
I don't understand how can,
okay,

1246
01:11:41,441 --> 01:11:42,740
so,
so I understand that,

1247
01:11:42,741 --> 01:11:44,890
that the bigger the territory that the 
more topical the story,

1248
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:45,993
but how can on on the level where they,
where they don't come from the same 

1249
01:11:47,801 --> 01:11:48,634
territory,
how can one be above another graphic 

1250
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:52,120
way?
It's not obvious up in terms of power.

1251
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:55,510
We're talking about an abstract,
right?

1252
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:58,670
So is it power?
So like the bottom one is,

1253
01:11:58,671 --> 01:12:01,090
is lower and louder than the top line.
Yes.

1254
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:06,220
The middle one is lower in power,
then the outside one it goes from,

1255
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:08,930
it goes from in to out.
Yeah.

1256
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:10,780
Yeah.
No,

1257
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:14,010
that's right.
And I know when we were talking about,

1258
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:16,990
here's an example,
you're working for a corporation.

1259
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,620
You're not the chief executive officer,
you're a vice president.

1260
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:22,870
Okay.
This is your store.

1261
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:26,690
There's three vice presidents.
There's one chief executive officer.

1262
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,960
Okay.
You're going to be concerned.

1263
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:29,973
One of your domains of concern is the 
viability of your position and 

1264
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:34,953
everything that it's like in,
cause you're also the head of a whole 

1265
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,720
whole set of other subordinates who are 
beneath you,

1266
01:12:40,721 --> 01:12:41,554
so to speak.
So that's your particular domain of 

1267
01:12:43,601 --> 01:12:45,730
concern.
But it would be rational,

1268
01:12:45,731 --> 01:12:46,564
so to speak,
under most conditions to subordinate 

1269
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:50,883
your desire to maintain this territory 
in favor of maintaining the entire 

1270
01:12:55,481 --> 01:12:56,470
territory.
Yes.

1271
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:57,603
Whenever there's a conflict,
I mean generally speaking you could 

1272
01:13:00,121 --> 01:13:02,500
envision perhaps some cases where that 
wouldn't be,

1273
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:04,120
Hey John ain't sure I understand.
Okay.

1274
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:07,600
So my question is really do the vibe and
do the vice presidents,

1275
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:09,790
is there a hierarchy amongst amongst 
them?

1276
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:11,550
You mean this way?
Yeah,

1277
01:13:11,551 --> 01:13:12,640
yeah,
that's what I'm asking.

1278
01:13:12,641 --> 01:13:13,720
I'm asking.
Oh,

1279
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:15,003
um,

1280
01:13:15,730 --> 01:13:17,190
well there would be,
if there

1281
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:22,300
isn't that there would be,
if they were ever engaged in a task that

1282
01:13:22,301 --> 01:13:24,370
would require them to arrange 
themselves.

1283
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,900
I mean like,
I'm not,

1284
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:26,734
I'm not reading this and this isn't a 
fixed picture of like there's not 

1285
01:13:30,581 --> 01:13:34,330
necessarily three of these subs subs if 
you place in that way.

1286
01:13:34,331 --> 01:13:38,640
Does that mean that it's possible in a 
dominant is hard for them to be relative

1287
01:13:38,641 --> 01:13:40,700
to quality of position?
Um,

1288
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,410
although that I think that would 
necessarily break down those,

1289
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:47,200
say if there's three vice presidents,
they have to organize themselves to do a

1290
01:13:47,201 --> 01:13:48,570
job.
There's going to be a,

1291
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:49,743
a dominance hierarchy that actually is 
hierarchical emerge in the course of 

1292
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:57,910
their cooperation or another story.
That's right.

1293
01:13:57,930 --> 01:13:59,230
They no tied into it.
Not your story.

1294
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:02,560
It's also the case that like your 
position in the dormant attire,

1295
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,990
he shifts across stories.

1296
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:06,303
You know,
it's like,

1297
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:08,560
well,
you might be a senior at Harvard and you

1298
01:14:08,561 --> 01:14:09,750
know,
so that you're at the top of,

1299
01:14:09,751 --> 01:14:11,860
of at least one part of dog's hierarchy 
there.

1300
01:14:11,861 --> 01:14:14,190
But then when you go on the workforce,
it's like whack.

1301
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:15,053
You're at the bottom of another 
dominance hierarchy or you can just 

1302
01:14:17,201 --> 01:14:18,034
shift in and out of them during the day.
And that's partly because we've been 

1303
01:14:21,281 --> 01:14:24,580
able to abstract or dominance 
hierarchies up to such a degree that you

1304
01:14:24,581 --> 01:14:29,581
could participate in and innumerable 
some of them even a symbolic coming,

1305
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:31,593
you can change the valence of a 
phenomena just by shifting your 

1306
01:14:33,851 --> 01:14:34,850
reference point.
Nope.

1307
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:37,360
Say It depends on what you contrast it 
with.

1308
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:39,190
I can say in the big picture of things,
right.

1309
01:14:39,191 --> 01:14:40,900
That's the big picture.
Exactly.

1310
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:43,090
Take the big,
something terrible happens to you.

1311
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:45,700
I take the big picture so the picture is
too big,

1312
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:46,990
then everything becomes worthless.

1313
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:51,220
What's the button?
This goes back a little ways to what you

1314
01:14:51,221 --> 01:14:52,310
said about,
um,

1315
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:56,750
when anomalous information is promising 
as opposed to threat.

1316
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:57,603
Yeah.
Yeah.

1317
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:02,170
Um,
and it sounded like you were saying that

1318
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:06,650
it relates to the feelings of advocacy 
of the hero or of the confront her.

1319
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:07,910
Yeah.
Uh,

1320
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:09,760
would you describe it as an act of 
faith?

1321
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,370
Yeah,
just curious about that.

1322
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:14,130
I mean,
um,

1323
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:17,583
what creates,
I mean is that what you did you mean to 

1324
01:15:20,681 --> 01:15:23,930
say feelings of personal efficacy?
Okay.

1325
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:26,320
You mean instead of an act of faith?
Well or how,

1326
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:29,790
how would you relate that to I guess 
what I'm trying to say that if you,

1327
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:30,624
if you undertake to voluntarily,
if you undertake to voluntarily expose 

1328
01:15:36,361 --> 01:15:40,830
yourself to an aspect of the unknown 
that is an act of faith.

1329
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:45,920
And whether you know it or not,
you are emulating this heroic model.

1330
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:47,403
So one of the things that young 
attempted to point out was that since 

1331
01:15:50,161 --> 01:15:50,994
you're doing that,
you might as well know it because as 

1332
01:15:52,861 --> 01:15:53,694
soon as you don't,
then you have access to this incredible 

1333
01:15:55,381 --> 01:15:56,214
wealth of information but sort of 
details the structure of that process 

1334
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:00,493
and that it can provide you with more 
explicit knowledge about what it might 

1335
01:16:02,941 --> 01:16:05,220
mean saying cause you're,
if you say,

1336
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:06,600
boy,
I wrote down,

1337
01:16:06,601 --> 01:16:11,601
when I think of the history as the 
historical historical a hypothesis.

1338
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:14,740
Let me see if I can find,

1339
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:23,870
can we ask revolutions in procedure 
bring about revolutions and experience.

1340
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:27,560
That's the hypothesis of historical man 
fundamentally.

1341
01:16:27,561 --> 01:16:31,560
Which is to say that
you can pause it,

1342
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:34,070
that through your actions you can 
transform your environment.

1343
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:35,083
That's an act of faith and it's the act 
of faith that precedes the construction 

1344
01:16:37,491 --> 01:16:39,350
of culture.
Because by doing that,

1345
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:42,440
what you are saying is that the 
individual,

1346
01:16:42,650 --> 01:16:43,483
despite the immense power of balance 
that appears between the individual and 

1347
01:16:46,281 --> 01:16:50,390
not knowing the individual is in fact 
part of the process.

1348
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:53,270
It's of equal magnitude.
Equal side.

1349
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:54,980
Remember I showed you these pictures?

1350
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:59,050
Let's see.

1351
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,700
Yeah,
this is a good one.

1352
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:08,693
Look.

1353
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:23,860
Okay.
Yeah,

1354
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:25,510
I know.
Sweet.

1355
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:27,390
Anyways,
you know,

1356
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,070
I would regard,
this is pre Columbian.

1357
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:35,150
I would return this as an image 
constrict constructed by the member of a

1358
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:35,984
culture for whom the hypothesis that the
individual was equivalent potency in 

1359
01:17:41,361 --> 01:17:42,194
comparison with the great mother or as 
as not true or just barely dawning on 

1360
01:17:47,031 --> 01:17:47,864
consciousness is there as the hero.
I mean there's a huge difference in 

1361
01:17:53,031 --> 01:17:56,210
terms of perceived relative power.
And then you see,

1362
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:59,360
well here this is a much more modern 
issue.

1363
01:17:59,361 --> 01:18:02,010
You see,
there's much more uh,

1364
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:07,340
indication of equality by this point.
Yeah.

1365
01:18:08,930 --> 01:18:12,440
So the notion of the divine individual 
like that's,

1366
01:18:12,441 --> 01:18:14,000
that's the,
that's what I think.

1367
01:18:14,001 --> 01:18:14,834
I think that idea,
it's mythological idea cause it has to 

1368
01:18:16,551 --> 01:18:17,384
do with meaning.
That's at the core of the democratic 

1369
01:18:19,221 --> 01:18:21,230
notion that everybody is equal before 
the law,

1370
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:24,500
which is has its roots in the idea that 
everyone is equal before God,

1371
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:27,260
but what that means by,
well by equal,

1372
01:18:27,261 --> 01:18:32,180
what equal means is that
your capacity for heroism is not limited

1373
01:18:32,181 --> 01:18:33,014
by your native abilities,
which I think is really interesting 

1374
01:18:35,301 --> 01:18:36,134
because it's very difficult for us to 
think of anything that you can do for 

1375
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:40,100
that.

1376
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:42,180
There really is an equal playing field 
for it.

1377
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:45,800
Like most things are dependent say on 
your intelligence that's heritable to at

1378
01:18:45,801 --> 01:18:48,680
least a substantial degree or your 
physical ability or your gender,

1379
01:18:48,681 --> 01:18:51,020
your race or these things that are 
really built in,

1380
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:55,220
but your capacity to face things that 
are anomalous,

1381
01:18:56,030 --> 01:18:57,980
that's really a part of your character.
I think that's,

1382
01:18:57,981 --> 01:18:58,814
that's above,
above those biological constraints in a 

1383
01:19:01,491 --> 01:19:02,324
way because what's anomalous to you is 
very much dependent on your personal 

1384
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:08,630
nature.
So you get the,

1385
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:11,480
you get problems that are exactly the 
same size that you are.

1386
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:12,913
So that's,
that's another part of the reason why 

1387
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:16,730
you get this weird notion of equality 
before God.

1388
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:17,803
I wrote a story about that later in the 
manuscript to try to make that clear in 

1389
01:19:20,311 --> 01:19:21,144
this story.
I met this woman when I was a behavior 

1390
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:25,430
therapist and this was a devastated 
woman.

1391
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:26,323
I mean she had every problem that you 
could imagine essentially and then a 

1392
01:19:29,451 --> 01:19:30,980
bunch more.
She,

1393
01:19:30,981 --> 01:19:33,590
uh,
she was so pathologically shy,

1394
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:37,340
but she could not look at anybody that 
she thought was up higher.

1395
01:19:37,341 --> 01:19:39,920
The dominants are not meant anybody.
I mean,

1396
01:19:39,921 --> 01:19:43,490
literally she was at the block and when 
she approached people say,

1397
01:19:43,491 --> 01:19:45,830
who are doing therapy in this one unit?
She'd go like this,

1398
01:19:45,831 --> 01:19:49,700
just like in just like an arcade figure 
approaching an amperage.

1399
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:54,730
She couldn't bear to look at the person.
And part of the behavioral treatment was

1400
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:58,470
to help her stop doing this because we 
should do it in public as well.

1401
01:19:58,471 --> 01:19:59,304
And of course,
people who act oddly in public tend to 

1402
01:20:02,091 --> 01:20:02,924
have a log social troubles.
So we were hoping to get rid of this 

1403
01:20:05,271 --> 01:20:07,230
particular symptom,
but she was also,

1404
01:20:07,231 --> 01:20:08,460
uh,
she,

1405
01:20:08,461 --> 01:20:11,460
uh,
she was not an intelligent person by any

1406
01:20:11,461 --> 01:20:12,510
stretch of the imagination.

1407
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:15,390
She probably had an Iq.
So we're in the neighborhood of 70,

1408
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,433
which is about two standard deviations 
below the mean or about four standard 

1409
01:20:18,781 --> 01:20:20,670
deviations below the average in this 
route.

1410
01:20:20,671 --> 01:20:21,504
So like she,
she's not a smart person unless you've 

1411
01:20:23,851 --> 01:20:24,684
tested people with Iq tests,
you really have no idea how much 

1412
01:20:26,761 --> 01:20:27,594
difference there is,
how much difference four standard 

1413
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:30,750
deviations means.
It means a lot.

1414
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:32,053
Uh,
she had very poor personal hygiene and 

1415
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:37,980
because I think probably because she was
raised as badly as you could possibly be

1416
01:20:37,981 --> 01:20:39,330
raised.
Um,

1417
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,193
um,
she wasn't particularly attractive as a 

1418
01:20:43,651 --> 01:20:44,640
person either.
She was,

1419
01:20:44,641 --> 01:20:45,474
she was,
uh,

1420
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:47,220
oh,
okay.

1421
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,300
What else?
Well,

1422
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:49,493
her boyfriend was at schizophrenia and 
he was also an alcoholic and he was 

1423
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:55,380
violent and he is to accuse her of being
possessed by the devil.

1424
01:20:55,381 --> 01:20:56,214
And he theater.
She lived with her mother who was like 

1425
01:20:59,071 --> 01:20:59,904
old and sick and an aunt who was 
bedridden and they were on welfare and 

1426
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:05,340
she had no education to speak.

1427
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:07,410
I've been really no hope for a job.
Like when I saw her,

1428
01:21:07,411 --> 01:21:09,500
she's probably close to 40.
Um,

1429
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:11,310
anyways,
like this woman,

1430
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:12,990
the cards were stacked against her,
you know,

1431
01:21:12,991 --> 01:21:16,020
in every way you could possibly imagine.
But what her primary,

1432
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:17,450
this was interesting.
They will,

1433
01:21:17,451 --> 01:21:22,451
her primary concern in therapy was not 
really what could be done for her.

1434
01:21:22,531 --> 01:21:24,900
Like she'd gone through behavioral 
treatment kind of work temporarily,

1435
01:21:24,901 --> 01:21:27,060
but she reverted to her old habits very,
very,

1436
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:28,463
very soon.
What she really wanted from me was to 

1437
01:21:31,381 --> 01:21:32,214
help her sort of make a dent in the,
she was an outpatient in the hospital 

1438
01:21:34,891 --> 01:21:35,724
administration so that she could find an
inpatient and these like the inpatients 

1439
01:21:39,451 --> 01:21:40,284
that are left in mental hospitals now,
these people are seriously troubled 

1440
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:46,200
because anybody that could possibly be 
let out has been let out.

1441
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:47,034
So like I used to go into the basement 
at the Douglas Hospital in Montreal and 

1442
01:21:49,351 --> 01:21:50,184
it was like,
it was like something out of Dante's 

1443
01:21:51,691 --> 01:21:52,200
inferno.

1444
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,033
It was an old building and the people,
like there was a coke room in the 

1445
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:57,870
basement and the people that were in 
there were just,

1446
01:21:58,630 --> 01:22:00,870
well,
you know those mini,

1447
01:22:00,871 --> 01:22:02,400
you know,
the medieval paintings of,

1448
01:22:02,401 --> 01:22:04,330
of disfigured people that were in 
common.

1449
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:05,760
Well,
that's what it was like down there.

1450
01:22:05,761 --> 01:22:07,200
And that's what most of the inpatients 
were like.

1451
01:22:07,201 --> 01:22:09,870
They're just,
they were just totally destroyed.

1452
01:22:09,871 --> 01:22:11,910
And some of them had been that way for 
like 30 years.

1453
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:15,360
So anyways,
what she wanted was not help for her.

1454
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:17,580
And she didn't come in to complain about
her situation,

1455
01:22:17,581 --> 01:22:19,130
even though there was lots of reasoning 
can play about,

1456
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:22,620
she wanted to find somebody in the 
hospital grounds that she could take out

1457
01:22:22,621 --> 01:22:25,470
for walks.
So yeah.

1458
01:22:25,471 --> 01:22:27,120
And she had dog that she used to take 
care of,

1459
01:22:27,121 --> 01:22:28,110
you know,
it out for walks.

1460
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:28,944
And she was,
I thought she was remarkable this 

1461
01:22:30,181 --> 01:22:31,014
person,
because

1462
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:36,150
from the deterministic standpoint,
so to speak,

1463
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,193
there's no reason at all that she should
have been anything but the hostile and 

1464
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:40,533
bidder.

1465
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:44,280
But her problems for whatever reasons,
we're not,

1466
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:48,200
we're not her primary focus of concern.
And,

1467
01:22:48,201 --> 01:22:49,034
uh,
well I thought that was just a good 

1468
01:22:50,251 --> 01:22:52,440
example of how,
you know,

1469
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:55,080
regardless of your particular 
circumstances,

1470
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:58,020
it is possible that you might make the 
right choices.

1471
01:22:58,650 --> 01:22:59,483
So,
and that that's maybe not dependent on 

1472
01:23:01,441 --> 01:23:04,230
things that you might consider 
biological givens.

1473
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:05,603
So,
and then I do think it's true that the 

1474
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:13,150
burrata your talents,
the bigger your responsibility.

1475
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:16,470
So that's how things work out just 
because,

1476
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:18,460
well,
that's one way you can make sense of the

1477
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:21,430
theoretical lead unequal distribution of
talents.

1478
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:27,060
The more talent,
the more responsibility simplest still.

1479
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:29,443
All right.
I guess I asked that because really 

1480
01:23:30,251 --> 01:23:31,750
you're,
it sounded as if we were describing,

1481
01:23:32,450 --> 01:23:34,390
uh,
the non threat,

1482
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:38,670
the promising anomalous as occurring 
sort of within a space that was,

1483
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:42,700
you could define a space within which 
like in a game of space within which the

1484
01:23:42,701 --> 01:23:45,250
anomalous occurs and it's safe.

1485
01:23:45,370 --> 01:23:46,260
Yeah.
Well we do,

1486
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:52,290
but this is an account in which it's 
more in the self,

1487
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:53,650
um,
yeah,

1488
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:56,980
that was able to deal with the anomalous
wherever it occurred.

1489
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,410
Right,
right.

1490
01:23:58,890 --> 01:23:59,310
No,
that,

1491
01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:01,180
that's a perfectly reasonable contrast.
I mean,

1492
01:24:01,390 --> 01:24:04,450
when we play,
that is what we're doing.

1493
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:07,420
The first thing you,
we're carving out a defined space.

1494
01:24:07,421 --> 01:24:08,230
We say,
look,

1495
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:09,063
here's the actual borders within this,
we will allow a certain amount of 

1496
01:24:12,551 --> 01:24:16,480
anomaly to occur so that we can practice
coping with the anomaly.

1497
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,700
People like that.
They like watching games for example.

1498
01:24:18,701 --> 01:24:19,310
Right.
That's,

1499
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:22,360
that's why kids play games as well.
It's like kids,

1500
01:24:22,361 --> 01:24:23,171
you know,
if you watch them,

1501
01:24:23,171 --> 01:24:25,120
if they're eight or nine years old to 
get together in the playground,

1502
01:24:25,121 --> 01:24:25,481
they'll say,
well,

1503
01:24:25,481 --> 01:24:26,730
here's the rules.
Black,

1504
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:28,870
black lab that defines the territory's,
right.

1505
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:30,153
Well the rules are just enough to get to
get something going so that someone 

1506
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:36,020
normally can occur at formal games are 
like that evening.

1507
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:37,533
And it is often difficult to distinguish
when it is that you're not playing a 

1508
01:24:39,911 --> 01:24:41,440
game anymore.
I mean,

1509
01:24:41,441 --> 01:24:43,390
some people play games their whole lives
formally.

1510
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:48,160
A lot of the things we do as academics 
ideologically are abstracted games,

1511
01:24:48,610 --> 01:24:49,443
that's for sure.
But there is a difference between that 

1512
01:24:50,981 --> 01:24:53,260
and the general sense that if a normally
arises,

1513
01:24:53,261 --> 01:24:54,610
I incapable of dealing with it.
Yeah,

1514
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:56,050
and that's,
that's the more,

1515
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,240
well,
they're both,

1516
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:01,720
they're both hero types.
I mean sports heroes or heroes,

1517
01:25:01,721 --> 01:25:03,550
right?
The ritual models for emulation,

1518
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:05,920
they deal with anomaly and bounded 
circumstances.

1519
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:09,460
I would say there,
there paragons of normal adaptation.

1520
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:12,640
That's right.
They master a bounded domain.

1521
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:16,450
They're not necessarily mastery.
The transition between domains,

1522
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,190
that's,
that's a different type of heroism

1523
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:21,610
but it's still a form of heroes.

1524
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:28,810
Are you saying that the greater your 
biological gift,

1525
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,393
you say the bigger your responsibility,
do you mean the bigger your 

1526
01:25:33,011 --> 01:25:35,230
responsibility to go out and encounter

1527
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,290
and bring it back?
I would say

1528
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:39,960
well there's more.
That's right.

1529
01:25:39,961 --> 01:25:41,370
That's part of it.
Right off the backs.

1530
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:46,050
Like what you don't know is differing in
contrast to what you know.

1531
01:25:46,290 --> 01:25:49,350
So the structure of what you know and 
its and its size,

1532
01:25:49,351 --> 01:25:53,190
so to speak is,
is a proportionate innocence to the kind

1533
01:25:53,191 --> 01:25:55,740
of unknowns that you'll encounter.
Like in a sense

1534
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,193
I read it say,
I don't remember where that one of the 

1535
01:25:59,731 --> 01:26:03,060
hallmarks of genius is the capacity to 
see mystery where others only see.

1536
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:05,203
So you won't even see the same things
with variance and capacity comes very 

1537
01:26:10,491 --> 01:26:12,410
innocent perception.
So,

1538
01:26:12,411 --> 01:26:13,990
and then I would say adapt.
Is it?

1539
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:14,983
So like
coping with coping with the stresses of 

1540
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:25,470
a about well-run household might be 
sufficient challenge for a given person.

1541
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:28,490
I mean,
in reality,

1542
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:29,353
I mean they may do a very good job of 
that and that's at the limits of their 

1543
01:26:31,521 --> 01:26:32,210
ability.

1544
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:33,043
And when you meet someone like that,
you regard them as admirable sort of 

1545
01:26:36,861 --> 01:26:40,820
intrinsically for someone whose talents 
are greater,

1546
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:44,420
their field of,
of conflict has to be greater,

1547
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:45,733
otherwise they're not.
They're putting artificial limitations 

1548
01:26:48,471 --> 01:26:51,450
on their,
on their development and all that unused

1549
01:26:51,490 --> 01:26:52,880
talent down.
Just work against them.

1550
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:54,263
You know,
there's nothing worse than a neurotic 

1551
01:26:55,161 --> 01:26:57,740
intellectual cause.
The neurotic intellectual is,

1552
01:26:57,850 --> 01:27:01,250
it's incredibly devious even to 
themselves.

1553
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:02,293
I mean,
if you're dealing with someone in 

1554
01:27:02,941 --> 01:27:05,180
therapy,
an Iq of 130 say,

1555
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:09,260
and they'd be telling themselves lies 
for 25 years and these lies are,

1556
01:27:09,261 --> 01:27:10,094
are unbelievably coherent and convincing
because they've used all that 

1557
01:27:13,251 --> 01:27:14,084
intellectual talent too to erect this 
thing that's really going to devour 

1558
01:27:17,421 --> 01:27:17,930
them.

1559
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:19,800
So,
so then you've made a,

1560
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:21,480
you separated.
Okay.

1561
01:27:21,481 --> 01:27:22,314
So there's a lot of time.
It's from the right hemisphere and the 

1562
01:27:23,151 --> 01:27:26,020
left hemisphere is,
produces the,

1563
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:28,650
the pleasing sensations in the unknown 
and the Right Hemisphere,

1564
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,260
the fearful lens.
Well,

1565
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:32,260
you've also separately the dimension of,
um,

1566
01:27:32,610 --> 01:27:35,430
it's not related to in the left 
hemisphere of the ability to organize,

1567
01:27:35,431 --> 01:27:36,960
et Cetera,
and then the in the right hemisphere.

1568
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:39,320
Can you tell there's this,
I think there's a certain amount of,

1569
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:42,000
of,
I don't know exactly how it

1570
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:43,960
thank you.
Social personalities have,

1571
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:45,550
uh,
or you know,

1572
01:27:45,730 --> 01:27:50,730
people who are in prisons or whatever,
they have generally low intelligence and

1573
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:53,260
uh,
but also,

1574
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:56,140
uh,
stimulated very easily by,

1575
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:56,790
by thing.

1576
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:57,481
Well,
that's one,

1577
01:27:57,481 --> 01:27:59,220
that's one line of theorizing.
Yeah.

1578
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:00,083
There's,
there's more to the story than like 

1579
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:02,783
Tamar men alone doesn't,
I don't think temperament alone is 

1580
01:28:04,561 --> 01:28:06,870
enough to make you conduct disorder anti
social.

1581
01:28:06,930 --> 01:28:07,763
I mean,
I would say that among like every 

1582
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:10,403
temperamental tight has its own,
has the kind of pathology gets most 

1583
01:28:14,101 --> 01:28:16,200
prone to like,
if you're really inhibited,

1584
01:28:16,201 --> 01:28:17,840
you'd likely to develop anxiety 
disorders.

1585
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:22,850
Like that's your sphere of weakness.
Like everybody has the sin towards which

1586
01:28:22,891 --> 01:28:23,780
they're most,
uh,

1587
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:25,013
they're most attracted so to speak.
But I think under very few 

1588
01:28:28,681 --> 01:28:29,514
circumstances,
could you say that temperament was 

1589
01:28:31,591 --> 01:28:35,670
destiny and even then if temperament is 
destiny,

1590
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:36,583
can you say,
well,

1591
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:37,583
the story that someone's participating 
in you isn't going sequence of 

1592
01:28:40,021 --> 01:28:40,854
biological forces.
I would say then that the morality of 

1593
01:28:43,291 --> 01:28:44,124
that person is still can only be 
calculated by looking at how they dealt 

1594
01:28:46,951 --> 01:28:49,890
with what they were particularly,
particularly given.

1595
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:51,690
I kind of,
I had a friend for example,

1596
01:28:51,691 --> 01:28:54,990
when I grew up who had an extensive 
family history of alcoholism.

1597
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:56,083
It's like went back at least three 
generations are affected a lot of his 

1598
01:28:58,381 --> 01:29:03,120
male relatives and by the time he was 14
he was alcoholic and I would say,

1599
01:29:03,121 --> 01:29:05,040
well,
how do you judge someone like that?

1600
01:29:05,070 --> 01:29:05,903
Well,
I mean you want you say is that there 

1601
01:29:07,651 --> 01:29:11,880
was much more temptation there,
so how he dealt with it,

1602
01:29:11,881 --> 01:29:14,640
that was his particular province and it 
didn't work out very well for him.

1603
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:17,680
But I guess what I'm trying to say is 
that,

1604
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:23,100
well it's the Senate.
Same thing I was trying to say with that

1605
01:29:23,101 --> 01:29:25,020
story about the woman at the hospital is
that,

1606
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:26,840
you know,
you're handed up your hand,

1607
01:29:26,841 --> 01:29:29,400
didn't know rang of problems that are 
unique.

1608
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:31,860
Some of those problems are biologically 
determined.

1609
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,083
The manner in which you approached them 
determines the integrity of your 

1610
01:29:35,551 --> 01:29:36,384
character.

1611
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:38,183
It's hard to judge that from outside.
And I think that's another reason why 

1612
01:29:41,330 --> 01:29:42,080
in,
in,

1613
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:42,913
in various religious traditions,
there's the notion that the only 

1614
01:29:45,931 --> 01:29:48,060
accurate judgment can come after your 
death,

1615
01:29:48,061 --> 01:29:49,020
for example,
that you know,

1616
01:29:49,021 --> 01:29:52,770
you have to be judged by a trans,
something of transcend the door edge and

1617
01:29:52,771 --> 01:29:54,780
for it to be accurate.
So,

1618
01:29:55,260 --> 01:30:00,260
but it would seem like you said,
of of his person and the 70 at Yosemite,

1619
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:05,000
that intelligence could help them to 
face,

1620
01:30:05,790 --> 01:30:07,800
to develop a better story.
Well,

1621
01:30:07,801 --> 01:30:09,330
consider it depends.
It depends on your,

1622
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:13,680
it depends on what you mean by better.
I mean that's the,

1623
01:30:13,681 --> 01:30:15,290
that's the issue.
More debt.

1624
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:17,910
Well,
I don't know.

1625
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:19,440
I don't know.
It's like if you,

1626
01:30:19,441 --> 01:30:20,274
if you're a smarter,
you have bigger problems there could've 

1627
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:22,740
just made it more bitter.
I mean,

1628
01:30:22,741 --> 01:30:24,510
she was at this dad's postures at this 
point,

1629
01:30:24,511 --> 01:30:25,344
willing to satisfy herself just by 
helping someone who was lower down the 

1630
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:28,520
issue.

1631
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:30,210
Right.
But she was more intelligent.

1632
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:31,143
It might have just met her.
At least it's conceivable that would be 

1633
01:30:33,841 --> 01:30:35,220
the case.
I mean for you,

1634
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:37,990
I mean you could look at this on a 
broader evolutionary scale and say,

1635
01:30:37,991 --> 01:30:39,930
well,
like our intelligence,

1636
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:43,050
does that make our life better?
Well,

1637
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:43,973
I would say,
well it's a toss up because on the one 

1638
01:30:46,261 --> 01:30:47,094
hand,
well here we sit and everything's 

1639
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:49,553
perfect.
On the other hand we've invented the 

1640
01:30:50,611 --> 01:30:55,611
atom bomb and like it's only been 40 
years and we don't know whether the fact

1641
01:30:55,861 --> 01:30:56,694
that here we sit and everything's 
wonderful is sufficient to 

1642
01:30:58,681 --> 01:31:01,170
counterbalance the fact that using the 
same intelligence,

1643
01:31:01,171 --> 01:31:04,080
we've also created this massive 
weaponry,

1644
01:31:04,081 --> 01:31:07,890
which,
which is still around and will always be

1645
01:31:07,891 --> 01:31:10,050
around to pretty much bring things to an
end.

1646
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:12,540
So intelligence is a moral,
that's my,

1647
01:31:12,630 --> 01:31:14,640
that's my take lines.
Like you can,

1648
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:19,970
you can use it one way or another and it
broadens your domain of action,

1649
01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:23,460
but there's nothing intrinsically good 
about it.

1650
01:31:23,550 --> 01:31:25,540
It's a tool.
And it's not related to temporary.

1651
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,650
Well,
I don't know if it's related temperament

1652
01:31:28,830 --> 01:31:32,240
or no.
Does this relate to like the dualism and

1653
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:33,143
the bureau move to the hero has a divine
parents with the hero also comes from 

1654
01:31:37,471 --> 01:31:38,460
humble?
Yes.

1655
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:43,050
Often.
Sort of like from unexpected places.

1656
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:44,213
Absolutely.
It's the same idea and it's the same 

1657
01:31:45,961 --> 01:31:46,794
notion that couldn't give Christianity.
There's the notion of an eternal Christ 

1658
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:53,220
and Christ that's,
it has a historical moment and what that

1659
01:31:53,370 --> 01:31:54,203
idea is trying to portray is the notion 
that the hero is that transpersonal 

1660
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:00,070
force,
so to speak.

1661
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:02,170
It's a constituent element of the 
psyche.

1662
01:32:02,410 --> 01:32:04,570
It's eternal because it's always 
regenerated,

1663
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:08,920
but at the same time it's perfectly 
reasonable to view that eternal thing as

1664
01:32:08,921 --> 01:32:13,210
something that's also necessarily exist 
within a specific set of constraints.

1665
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:17,860
And I would say that could not exist 
without that set of constraints,

1666
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:18,783
which is something that will also deal 
with more of the latter half of the man 

1667
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:22,570
of the chorus,
the manuscripts,

1668
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:26,380
the constraints,
not only our constraints,

1669
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:29,530
but they define the capability for 
action.

1670
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,260
Sorry,
I was talking with someone the other day

1671
01:32:32,261 --> 01:32:33,094
and they said,
well,

1672
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:35,560
if everything was orderly,
there'd be nothing left to do.

1673
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:37,083
And that's well that's the same sort of 
notion that Dostoyevsky describes when 

1674
01:32:40,661 --> 01:32:41,494
he points out that if we established a 
political utopia where everything was 

1675
01:32:45,281 --> 01:32:46,114
predictable basically in perfect,
the first thing that people would do 

1676
01:32:48,011 --> 01:32:48,844
would be to drive themselves crazy just 
so that something unexpected could 

1677
01:32:51,161 --> 01:32:51,994
happen.
And so in literal truth that life could 

1678
01:32:53,951 --> 01:32:57,070
go on.
So anyways,

1679
01:32:57,430 --> 01:32:58,263
this is,
this is something that's really useful 

1680
01:32:59,471 --> 01:33:02,950
to consider and we will get into it 
because one of the questions that people

1681
01:33:02,951 --> 01:33:06,340
always pose is why is it the terrible 
things have to happen?

1682
01:33:07,110 --> 01:33:07,943
And I,
you know what the myth basically 

1683
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:14,400
suggests that well
for there to be something,

1684
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:18,880
there has to be a division between the 
limited domain in an unlimited demand.

1685
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,490
There has to be,
it's a precondition for existence.

1686
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:22,563
So then the question is,
if the existence of limitation is a 

1687
01:33:25,421 --> 01:33:29,200
necessary precondition for existence,
is it justifiable?

1688
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:30,610
And you know,
that's the big question.

1689
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:32,343
Ask The big question
if limitation is a precondition for 

1690
01:33:35,801 --> 01:33:36,634
experience is limitation justify.
And I would say what these mythological 

1691
01:33:39,701 --> 01:33:40,534
stories are trying to do is to tell you 
the story about how it could be that 

1692
01:33:44,651 --> 01:33:46,960
limitation might be rendered bearable.
If it's,

1693
01:33:46,961 --> 01:33:51,310
say it's a precondition for experience.
Well this is like for me,

1694
01:33:51,311 --> 01:33:52,144
this is something really worth knowing 
because that's a big question for 

1695
01:33:54,491 --> 01:33:55,324
people,
especially when something really 

1696
01:33:55,931 --> 01:33:56,980
traumatic happens.
It's like,

1697
01:33:56,981 --> 01:33:59,140
why?
How can I make sense out of this?

1698
01:33:59,650 --> 01:34:00,483
Or isn't this event so terrible that it 
undermines the utility of any possible 

1699
01:34:04,541 --> 01:34:06,730
story I could tell myself,
oh,

1700
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:09,160
that's what happens when someone close 
to you dies.

1701
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:10,580
You know,
this is such a,

1702
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:13,840
this is such a catastrophe that 
everything in,

1703
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:16,110
in the line of this is evidently few 
tile.

1704
01:34:16,650 --> 01:34:17,800
Well that's,
you know,

1705
01:34:17,830 --> 01:34:19,870
that's sort of the bottom line of 
questions.

1706
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:21,790
Can you make sense out of that?

1707
01:34:23,150 --> 01:34:23,983
So

1708
01:34:27,810 --> 01:34:28,920
other questions?

1709
01:34:32,130 --> 01:34:32,963
Okay.
Wow.

1710
01:34:34,610 --> 01:34:35,443
Okay.
Well that's probably good enough for 

1711
01:34:36,351 --> 01:34:37,010
today.

1712
01:34:37,010 --> 01:34:40,280
I will put your papers outside my office
on,

1713
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:42,170
there's a little black bench there.
Um,

1714
01:34:42,590 --> 01:34:46,250
every paper will have a sheet attached 
to it that has detailed comments and the

1715
01:34:46,251 --> 01:34:47,084
grade and I hope it will be there.
Don't come until Friday morning to see 

1716
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:52,820
it.
It'll be there Friday.

1717
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:56,873
Okay.
