1
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,710
We're going to talk about frogs,
so yeah.

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,370
Are you okay?
So yeah,

3
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:18,210
when we saw,
I mean,

4
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:21,240
when I saw the video that you put up,
was it two days ago now?

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:22,770
Yeah.
Two days ago.

6
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:24,540
I couldn't believe it.
Yeah.

7
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:29,541
And the next morning I got an email from
my brother who also studies symbolism 

8
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:29,730
and it's very,
very smart person.

9
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:34,731
And he said,
does Jordan know he's incarnating pepe 

10
00:00:34,731 --> 00:00:34,731
right now.

11
00:00:34,731 --> 00:00:35,690
Yeah.
Well that's the funny thing is,

12
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,520
you know,
I knew about pappy,

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,940
but what it was,
I had nothing like that on my mind when 

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,871
I made the video.
It never even entered my mind that that 

15
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:49,211
was an association.
I mean I was just concentrating on this 

16
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:52,691
kermit thing that had popped up that 
probably popped up about two years ago 

17
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:57,000
and I.
The first time someone said that I 

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,000
thought,
Huh.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,550
So I went and listened to Kermit and I 
thought,

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,330
Oh yeah,
I do have a voice that similar to that I

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,480
see I can get it lower,
but my voice tends to rise up into my 

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,010
right,
into my cause of tension.

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,300
So.

24
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,110
So this is it.
We need to do like,

25
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,000
so we need to do the metaphysics of 
PIPPA.

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,430
No one has done it yet,
I think.

27
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,880
Yes,

28
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,110
exactly.
Exactly.

29
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,480
Well,
and so you know,

30
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:24,481
and then then this strange occurrence.
So of course also also emerged with 

31
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:27,980
regards to the mask that Charles had 
made me wear the hat.

32
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,580
Yeah.
Which it looks like Pippi has red lips,

33
00:01:31,581 --> 00:01:34,190
which is staggering.
It's absolutely staggering.

34
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,110
And so I just about fainted when I,
after I posted that and people start,

35
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,390
people pointed out the correspondents 
with pepe.

36
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:42,950
Really?
I just about fainted.

37
00:01:42,951 --> 00:01:44,880
It was.
And that doesn't happen very often.

38
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:49,881
Like I can only remember one other time 
in my life when I was shocked enough to 

39
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:53,240
almost faint.
I just thought that was just too much.

40
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:58,241
It was too much to bear.
And then thinking about the 

41
00:01:58,241 --> 00:01:59,720
correspondence is since then it has 
been.

42
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,010
Well it's,
it's,

43
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,810
it's,
it's,

44
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,140
it's inexplainable and absurd.
But so much of this is inexplicably 

45
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:08,480
Missouri.
I don't know,

46
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:10,730
I tweeted something yesterday,
uh,

47
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,780
I looked at maps of meaning my book on 
the Amazon,

48
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,760
a seller lists to see where it was 
located and it was number eight on,

49
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,260
on books that are associated with 
behaviorism andw ,

50
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,860
and it was bracketed by two other books,
mastery.

51
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,920
Inbound is cheese book,
and she's the person who invented the 

52
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,020
iat that's been used to fair it out.
Unconscious bias.

53
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:38,140
Oh my goodness.
The other one was a book by Richard 

54
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,500
Bandler that I think was called frogs 
and princesses just.

55
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,710
And then to find out about cat,
you know,

56
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:45,100
I didn't know about CAC.
Anyways,

57
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:50,110
it's.
And then today I was thinking I was 

58
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,391
watching Nina Paley who was an absolute 
genius and she's animated the plagues 

59
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:54,440
that,
that Moses called down on the Pharaoh.

60
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,720
And of course one of the plagues was a 
plague of frogs.

61
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:57,800
Yeah.
And so,

62
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,870
okay.
And so the,

63
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:00,100
the,
the frog

64
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,560
is,
is,

65
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,640
is a,
is a perfect liminal character because 

66
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,060
the frog,
and I think you tweeted about this as 

67
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,791
well,
the frog lives both in water and on 

68
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:11,791
land.
And so it's like a,

69
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,710
it has a monstrous characteristic that 
it can cross.

70
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,080
It's one of those things that crosses 
over between,

71
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,180
between worlds.
Um,

72
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,560
and so you see that,
you see that in the story.

73
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:26,561
It's the story of the,
of the frog and the princess is a 

74
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:29,941
perfect example.
And he relates to the Pinocchio story 

75
00:03:29,941 --> 00:03:30,230
that we talked about earlier.
Uh,

76
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:30,650
so,
uh,

77
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,700
princess goes to a pond,
she's playing with her favorite thing,

78
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:38,701
which is this golden ball.
And so she drops the ball just to 

79
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:43,021
mention something.
That golden ball is the same thing as 

80
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:44,980
the snitch that Harry Potter chases in 
the quidditch games and Harry Potter.

81
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,150
And it's funny because inside the snitch
is actually part of Voldemort's soul,

82
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,080
right?

83
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,080
So,
and so that's part of the soul of evil 

84
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,300
that's inside the Golden Ball and the 
golden bowl.

85
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,750
And Harry Potter has wings,
which makes it around chaos.

86
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,150
Technically speaking.
It's an alchemical symbol.

87
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,660
And the round chaos is a mercurial 
symbol.

88
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,900
And the spirit,
mercury is an emissary of the gods.

89
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:12,901
And so the,
the guards are speaking to you and when 

90
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:14,860
anything flickers in front of you and 
captures your attention,

91
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,080
and in the quidditch game,
the person who follows what captures his

92
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:23,860
attention is the seeker and also the 
person who wins.

93
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,900
Not so much the game,
but the metagame.

94
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,840
What's important,
I think in this story,

95
00:04:27,841 --> 00:04:30,090
is that the ball is the most important 
thing.

96
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,880
That's why it's golden.
It's golden.

97
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,760
So for her it's the idea that it is the 
most important thing.

98
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,730
So she drops this ball in the end,
the water it gets,

99
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:41,430
it gets lost.
So she loses the most important thing.

100
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:42,720
It falls into chaos,

101
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,940
right?
So that's the death of God purposes

102
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,120
or,
or just the idea of.

103
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,020
Yeah.
Or just the idea of,

104
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,000
of,
of the loss of innocence or you know,

105
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:55,010
whatever.
Whatever you think about it in terms of 

106
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,260
the loss of the most important thing.
And so this rog appears and says,

107
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,140
you know,
I can go get your ball if you,

108
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,930
if you,
if you promise something for me.

109
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,260
And so the promise is that she will 
bring the frog with her into her castle.

110
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,680
Let the frog eat with her and then let 
the dog sleep in her bed.

111
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,990
Okay,
so when got those two things,

112
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:17,690
food and sex we talked about before as 
well,

113
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,020
so she saw the frog goes down into the 
water and then brings up the most 

114
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,911
important thing and the princesses 
forced to accept this frog in her.

115
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,850
She doesn't want to be like she's very 
annoyed that she has to to to to to let 

116
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,721
the frog into her house,
eat from a plate and then finally into 

117
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:38,180
her bed.
But by doing that,

118
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,840
the fraud of course transforms into a 
prince.

119
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,590
Here you have this,
this,

120
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,610
this idea that we talked about before 
where the most important thing goes out 

121
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,380
into chaos and whatever can bring it,
bring it back,

122
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,680
right?
Whatever it can bring it back to us has 

123
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,980
can be tamed and can enter into,
into the world.

124
00:05:57,981 --> 00:05:59,900
Can you find this place into the world

125
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,400
maybe even turns into this thing of the 
highest value?

126
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,270
Yes,
exactly.

127
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:08,271
Well,
that's something for people to really 

128
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:08,271
think about.
About,

129
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:08,940
about marriages for example.
So you know,

130
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:11,730
people are always,
and I think this is part of the profound

131
00:06:11,731 --> 00:06:15,210
immaturity of our culture.
People are always running around waiting

132
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:17,640
to find the perfect person who's perfect
for them.

133
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,760
And so you know,
one thing you might think is that if you

134
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:25,761
ever found the perfect person,
they would run away from you screaming 

135
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:29,661
immediately.
So because and so that perfection is 

136
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:31,710
something that you have to build within 
a relationship.

137
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:34,500
And so you accept the other person,
so to speak,

138
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:38,940
warts and all and hope that they do the 
same to you and swear that you won't run

139
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:41,910
from each other.
And then as a consequence of that,

140
00:06:41,911 --> 00:06:46,911
you can engage in a mutual process of 
transformation that emerges as a 

141
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:49,370
consequence of telling the truth and,
and,

142
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:53,400
and having a truthful relationship.
And then as a consequence of that,

143
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,550
the transformation can take place and 
you might start with a frog,

144
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:58,050
but maybe you end up with a prince.

145
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,100
So like we talked about the idea that,
that this is the structure of the world.

146
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:07,420
And so it happens as much on a personal 
level as it does on a,

147
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:08,860
on a social level,
on a bigger,

148
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,880
bigger,
bigger sense.

149
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,640
So just that little hint we talked about
before,

150
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:17,641
the story of Abraham and the three 
angels coming and announcing the birth 

151
00:07:17,641 --> 00:07:19,390
of a of Abraham's son.
Well,

152
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,330
in the story of sleeping beauty,
that's exactly what happens.

153
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,660
The queen goes to the pond and there,
Lo and behold,

154
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:31,661
there's a talking frog and the frog is 
the one who announced it to the queen 

155
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:34,600
that she will have a child,
the most beautiful child in the world.

156
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,800
And so again,
here is this idea of something coming 

157
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:39,800
from chaos.

158
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,600
Well that's interesting because you 
know,

159
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,590
in the diagrams in my book,
in maps of meaning,

160
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,040
one of the diagrams is an egg shape 
that,

161
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,160
that,
that is the chaos into which things 

162
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,160
plunge.
But chaos is,

163
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,640
it is an absolute state.
In some sense.

164
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,400
It's,
it's the state of the unknown as such.

165
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:02,790
And you never see the unknown as such.
You always see something that's partly 

166
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,020
known and partly unknown.
And that's what the frog is sitting on 

167
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,840
the edge of the pond.
The frog enables you.

168
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,000
So the,
the,

169
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:11,800
the frog is an emissary of chaos,
roughly speaking.

170
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,380
And you always,
you only meet an emissary of chaos.

171
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:16,200
You'd never meet chaos because it's,
it's,

172
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:16,950
it's like,
uh,

173
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,600
it's like,
um,

174
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,310
it's a non

175
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,580
non non non existent.
It's being,

176
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:22,920
it's below being,
if you will.

177
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,920
Right?
Right.

178
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:24,580
Exactly.

179
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,730
And so,
so now this thing like,

180
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,410
well,
two things,

181
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:30,210
one is interesting is that kermit the 
frog is,

182
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,430
is the same thing because kermit is,
is a host,

183
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,320
he's a host on a,
on a show.

184
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:41,321
And so what he does is he transitions.
He's the transition between different 

185
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:45,821
worlds.
So you have an act and then you have 

186
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:47,900
this transitional figure which appears 
and then you have another act.

187
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,930
And so that's what,
that's the role that kermit the frog 

188
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:53,090
plays on the muppet show.
Yes.

189
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,630
Primary problem is ms dot peggy,
who's a really loud feminist.

190
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,750
That's hilarious.
Okay.

191
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:02,870
And now,
now pepe,

192
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,920
because well here's,
here's,

193
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,840
here's the,
here's the metaphysics of Pippi.

194
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,870
So this is what's happening in the world
right now,

195
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:12,270
is that there's a very strange situation
where the,

196
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,180
the,
the people like let's say the right,

197
00:09:14,181 --> 00:09:16,930
we'll call them the right or like the 
forces of order or the,

198
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,970
the,
the let's say the norm,

199
00:09:19,971 --> 00:09:22,310
the people who create the norm for 
society.

200
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:27,340
Okay.
So we're in a situation where things 

201
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,801
have been inverted and the people who 
supposedly in the narrative are the ones

202
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:31,910
who create the norm are,
are,

203
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,660
are being marginalized,
they're being pushed into the,

204
00:09:35,661 --> 00:09:36,950
into the margins,
right?

205
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:42,110
And to be told you're the ones who 
create the norm and we're going to push 

206
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:42,530
you out into,
into the margin.

207
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,550
And so

208
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,320
that's where they've identified with the
frog.

209
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,200
That's why they have identified with the
park.

210
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,300
Because the,
the,

211
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,790
what happens is there's a strange 
inversion that happens,

212
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:58,030
right?
The power of inversion and the power of 

213
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,030
mocking.
And the power of,

214
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,860
of humor is usually on the side of,
of cast.

215
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,610
It's usually on this side of the power 
of the margin.

216
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,460
Well,
I noticed like I noticed this happening 

217
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,800
about 20 years ago is all the,
the right wing had all the comedians.

218
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,220
I thought,
what the Hell's going on here?

219
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,850
The right wing doesn't have the 
comedians.

220
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:16,170
It's the rich.
The left.

221
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:19,170
It has the comedians.
They're the ones that are poking fun.

222
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,910
So strange that the comedians have 
become the,

223
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,850
the right wing has started to express 
itself in comedy.

224
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,590
Yeah.
So that,

225
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,310
that,
that is a sign that there's a,

226
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,560
there's this strange inversion that's 
happening.

227
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,190
Uh,
and so there's,

228
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,060
there's an interesting,
like just a little footnote on this,

229
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:41,061
like in the,
in the Bible there's a story that talks 

230
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:41,061
about this.
It's the story of Elijah.

231
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:45,200
So the time will be Lija.
Israel has been worshiping false gods 

232
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,040
because of the Queen Jezza Bell,
right?

233
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:51,150
And Elijah who is supposed to be the 
prophet of the God of that,

234
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,600
of those people has become a marginal 
figure.

235
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,930
And so his name is Elijah the stranger,
which is very odd because he's not a,

236
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,460
he is supposed to be a prophet of God 
and his tool,

237
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,730
his mockery.
He mocks the prophets of Baal.

238
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,820
And that's something that you actually 
don't see very often in the Bible where 

239
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,170
the tool to kind of bring back order is 
through mockery.

240
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:14,830
And so this is what we're seeing with 
this pip.

241
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:19,050
A figure is that pep a is like a,
it's like an inversion machine.

242
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,310
Okay.
So,

243
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:21,150
so,
so the,

244
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,170
the people who use pippy,
what they do is they take something like

245
00:11:25,171 --> 00:11:28,110
an insult that's being thrown at them 
and they flip it around,

246
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,600
flip it around on those that insulted 
them.

247
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,310
Like that's what you did with the kermit
thing,

248
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:33,710
which is perfect.
You,

249
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:38,750
you see people are making fun of you 
because they say you sound like kermit 

250
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:38,750
and you're saying,
okay,

251
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,400
I'm going to take this and I'm going to 
make it into my strength.

252
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,070
And that's what pip a pip.
It does.

253
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,840
And so a lot of the crazy stuff that's 
coming out of this tip,

254
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:47,250
a thing is,
is,

255
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,510
is,
is part of that.

256
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:50,550
There's a lot of dark things in,
in the Pipa,

257
00:11:50,551 --> 00:11:55,551
you know,
like things that like personally I 

258
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:55,551
wouldn't want to touch.

259
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:58,470
When I first saw the frog the frog,
I really recoiled from it.

260
00:11:58,471 --> 00:12:03,471
It's,
it's got this kind of underground comic 

261
00:12:03,471 --> 00:12:05,850
horror associated with it that I really,
I really find distasteful.

262
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,550
So like sort of viscerally distasteful.

263
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,260
Yeah,
but I think it's supposed,

264
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,210
it's kind of supposed to do that to you 
in that part of the power of,

265
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,830
of those that are using that,
that image,

266
00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:18,180
like it's right there.
If you look at it,

267
00:12:18,181 --> 00:12:19,770
it's right there.
And the first comic,

268
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:21,540
like the first hippie comic,
you know,

269
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,630
you have a very crass but,
but here's this,

270
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,940
this frog,
right?

271
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:29,970
Who,
who goes to the toilet to urinate,

272
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:34,320
but he pulls his pants down to his knees
and so he's doing something that usually

273
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:39,321
you,
if you pull your pants down to your 

274
00:12:39,321 --> 00:12:40,581
knees,
you're going to sit and do something 

275
00:12:40,581 --> 00:12:40,581
else.
But then he does that.

276
00:12:40,581 --> 00:12:41,010
But he stands.
And so here's this.

277
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,720
And he shows us his backside,
right?

278
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,290
So here's this,
this strange power of inversion,

279
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,170
which actually brings the man to stand 
back up.

280
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,760
And so that's this double inversion that
people who use this,

281
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:55,500
this,
this type of imagery are doing.

282
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,710
And so even it's like,
you know,

283
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,200
let's say like the radical left wing 
saying your,

284
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,040
your,
this,

285
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:07,070
whatever,
you're a white male controlling 

286
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:07,070
Blahblahblahblahblah,
you're all these things.

287
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,560
And the people who use these pepe comics
there,

288
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,770
they say yes,
and they'll,

289
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:15,771
and they reflect that to you.
And then the people who were accused 

290
00:13:15,771 --> 00:13:18,720
them of that completely lose their mind.
They completely lose their mind.

291
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,370
But the only thing they're doing is 
saying,

292
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,960
you're saying,
let's say that I'm a racist,

293
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:24,900
this blah blah blah.
And then they reflect that back to them.

294
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,930
They invert it in a way because they're 
saying,

295
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:33,020
here you go,
I'll show you what you're telling me I 

296
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,020
am.
And then,

297
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,020
and then the,
you know,

298
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,060
the,
the left,

299
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,610
the radical left wing lose their mind.
And so it's like.

300
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,760
And so it's kind of.
And if you look at those people like the

301
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:41,610
alt right people,
they have this strange,

302
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,080
strange magic,
right?

303
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,800
Because look at,
if you look at Milo is Milo Yiannopoulos

304
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:48,360
is a perfect example.
You know,

305
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:52,050
here is a half Greek,
half Jewish,

306
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:57,110
gay Catholic,
trump supporting enrichment Englishman 

307
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,280
in America.
And,

308
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,680
and so not talking to the Republicans.
Exactly.

309
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,330
And so nothing people can throw it in 
and we'll stick on him because he is the

310
00:14:06,331 --> 00:14:09,420
frog.
Like he is that marginal figure standing

311
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:10,620
on the side,
but he's,

312
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,790
he's,
he's like,

313
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,650
he is that double in virgin and he,
he's kind of,

314
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:19,830
I know if he's trying,
but what it seems like he's doing is 

315
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,760
bringing order back through like this 
double flip that's happening.

316
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,330
It's very odd.
It's very odd.

317
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,840
Very strange.
It's very strange time.

318
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,660
So anyways,
I would just say just just,

319
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,030
I mean,
just be careful.

320
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,710
It's a dangerous place to stand.

321
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,580
Yeah,
I'm,

322
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,160
yes,
I'm trying to be careful.

323
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:37,470
Believe me,
I've got lots of people that I'm talking

324
00:14:37,471 --> 00:14:42,471
to that are helping me formulate my 
arguments and articulate them properly 

325
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:46,530
and like I'm doing my best to keep my 
feet on the ground and my eyes open and,

326
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:49,650
and,
and not to be angry about this,

327
00:14:49,651 --> 00:14:54,651
but to be in the chaos really.
And not assume also that that's a 

328
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:55,880
catastrophe because I don't know what's 
going to happen to me.

329
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:01,150
I don't know if this is the worst thing 
that ever happened to me or the best 

330
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:01,150
thing that ever happened to me.
I can't tell.

331
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,860
Yeah.
And what'd you,

332
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,790
what the solution will happen inside the
chaos,

333
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,390
right?
The,

334
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,090
the,
the,

335
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,240
the,
the Jonah gets pulled down by the whale 

336
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,240
down into the depths of the,
uh,

337
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,820
of the,
of the ocean and it's while he's in the 

338
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,511
belly of the whale,
that the solution comes to him like his 

339
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:19,511
face,
if he,

340
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:24,101
he has,
he has this moment of repentance where 

341
00:15:24,101 --> 00:15:24,101
he turns,
he turns around.

342
00:15:24,101 --> 00:15:27,881
Repentance is a flipping around and so 
that the moment that he brings him into 

343
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:33,371
death,
turns into this baptism where he comes 

344
00:15:33,371 --> 00:15:33,371
out and he's,
you know,

345
00:15:33,371 --> 00:15:33,371
and he's a,
he's a,

346
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,060
he goes into the city,
right?

347
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:36,370
So that's another part,
but,

348
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:36,850
but,
but,

349
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,490
so that,
yeah,

350
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,350
the solution is going to come out of 
this chaos right now.

351
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:43,080
It's still great

352
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,050
problem.
If it's a really complex problem,

353
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,900
you have to go very far into chaos to 
find a solution.

354
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,310
But there's always the risk of losing 
yourself when you're in chaos.

355
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:52,690
So that.
Right.

356
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,110
Well,
that's right.

357
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:59,111
I mean,
that's the thing about dragons is that 

358
00:15:59,111 --> 00:15:59,111
they can eat you.
Yeah.

359
00:15:59,111 --> 00:16:02,630
That's why I don't like the new age,
age suffocation of Carl Young,

360
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:07,631
stinking and in part,
I think Joseph Campbell was responsible 

361
00:16:07,631 --> 00:16:10,781
for that,
although he did a lot of very good 

362
00:16:10,781 --> 00:16:10,781
things.
I mean,

363
00:16:10,781 --> 00:16:11,870
the thing about the thing about 
confronting the thing that you're afraid

364
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:16,871
of is that the thing that you're afraid 
of is genuinely terrifying and it can 

365
00:16:16,871 --> 00:16:19,190
actually eat you and it's eaten plenty 
of people before you.

366
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,240
And so it's no joke and you know what I 
mean?

367
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,740
During this whole,
let's call it ride so far.

368
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,630
I mean,
what,

369
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:30,920
yeah,
what was going to happen,

370
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:32,660
and especially in the first couple of 
weeks,

371
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:35,750
I mean,
when I was being called a bigot,

372
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,900
transphobic,
all of those things and being pilloried 

373
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,151
essentially,
at least within the university for my 

374
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:43,151
views,
um,

375
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:44,660
it wasn't obvious at all that there was 
going to be any,

376
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:50,250
uh,
there was going to be any way of 

377
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:50,250
swimming out of it,
let's say.

378
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:50,250
So,

379
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,390
but it's uh,
it's,

380
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:56,430
it's very,
it's very disturbing because now you 

381
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,911
have,
you basically have these two monsters 

382
00:16:58,911 --> 00:16:58,911
fighting each other,
you know,

383
00:16:58,911 --> 00:17:02,931
like that you have,
let's say this pepe type frog and you 

384
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:03,060
know,
the Hippie was declared a hate,

385
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:08,130
uh,
hate symbol by the Anti Defamation 

386
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:08,130
League.
You know,

387
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:08,130
that.
I mean,

388
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,801
that's very frightening.
It's frightening that this is how far 

389
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:12,801
it's gone,
how much.

390
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:14,070
It's like,
you know,

391
00:17:14,071 --> 00:17:18,900
all of a sudden they see that they can 
see the monster on the other side,

392
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:21,080
but they don't see the monster on their 
side,

393
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,560
you know,
and,

394
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:24,420
and the,
the LGBTQ,

395
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,530
etc.
Etc.

396
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,590
I mEan,
that is itself a,

397
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,560
a liminal forum.
Look

398
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,500
what's happening with it.
It's the same thing that,

399
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,680
that happened with the gender neutral 
pronouns.

400
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:41,681
As soon as you blew the binary apart,
there was an endless multiplication of 

401
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:43,070
potential identities.
Now was the chaos manifesting itself and

402
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:48,310
the ever expanding letters that go along
with lbgt is an example of exactly the 

403
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:51,240
same thing.
It's like,

404
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:52,590
well,
we're marginalized.

405
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,940
Well,
we're marginalized too.

406
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,330
Well,
we're marginalized too.

407
00:17:55,331 --> 00:17:58,290
And how about us were also marginalized 
and it's like,

408
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,490
and I guess that's also partly because 
each person has at least one element of 

409
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,020
that seriously marginalized,
marginalized in some manner.

410
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,370
Yeah.

411
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,510
Yeah.
And the rain.

412
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,480
and it's interesting like the rainbow is
a,

413
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,280
is actually a perfect symbol because a 
rainbow is,

414
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:14,770
is,
is,

415
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,750
is actually,
is,

416
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:16,670
uh,
is just a,

417
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:17,920
uh,
it's,

418
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:23,010
it's a fluid thing.
It is a fluid thing or rambo is not six 

419
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,170
colors or rainbow is a spectrum of 
colors and there's,

420
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,190
there's,
it is chaos itself.

421
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,690
It's the division of order into an 
indefinite amount of things.

422
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,920
Right?
So we,

423
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:32,450
we,
we,

424
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:37,260
we typify a rainbow into six coLors but,
but it's actually just the spectrum of.

425
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,660
And so it is in definitively,
it can be separated indefinitely,

426
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,150
right?
It's no limit to how much it can be.

427
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,180
It seems to me that that's actually the 
problem with the identity legislation.

428
00:18:49,181 --> 00:18:50,530
It's like,
well,

429
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:56,130
like marriage,
isn't that like an identity is a very 

430
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:56,130
important thing,
right?

431
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,941
And identity is something you have,
but it's also something that you and I 

432
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:03,781
play out.
So you have to negotiate your identity 

433
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:04,360
with the rest of the social world.
It's like a game in some sense,

434
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,950
but identity also has to have a function
like,

435
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,620
and this is also why the legislation is 
so pernicious because it just says,

436
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:13,570
well your identity is whatever you want 
it to be.

437
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,490
And it's like,
well no,

438
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:17,680
it's not because you have to live with 
other people.

439
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:22,681
It's like,
it's like saying you can play whatever 

440
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:22,681
game you want to play.
it's like,

441
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:25,270
well you can't because you got to get 
people to play with.

442
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:30,300
That's right.
We were playIng together and you can 

443
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:30,300
say,
well you have to play my game.

444
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,080
Well I can tell you toddlers on the,
on the school ground who say you have to

445
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:37,081
play my game.
They just get shunned and then the game 

446
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:39,490
itself has to be playable.
That's the other thing is that there,

447
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:44,570
there,
there are playable and non playable 

448
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:44,570
games and one of the things that piaget 
pointed out,

449
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:49,171
the developmental psychologist piaget 
pointed out about a game is that one of 

450
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:52,480
the hallmarks of an acceptable game is 
that people want to play it voluntarily.

451
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,540
And that's another part of the 
legislation that's so pernicious.

452
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:56,110
It's like,
okay,

453
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:59,560
you have a game and it's a game that 
you've chosen subjectively,

454
00:19:59,561 --> 00:20:02,170
because that's what it says in the 
legislation and when,

455
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:07,190
when you come near me,
you have to play my game whether you 

456
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,651
want to or not.
And then the problem with that too is 

457
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:11,140
that,
well where does that stop?

458
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,190
And the answer is it stops with 
indefinite multiplication.

459
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:21,390
So the whole point of society is to 
enforce a game that somewhat arbitrary 

460
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,831
that everyone can more or less play.
They sacrifice parts of themselves to 

461
00:20:25,831 --> 00:20:26,160
play it,
but it it,

462
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,680
it beats the total chaos of,
of,

463
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,640
of the war against,
of all,

464
00:20:30,641 --> 00:20:31,810
against all.
For example,

465
00:20:31,811 --> 00:20:33,700
that's the hobbs zen right nightmare,
right?

466
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,040
And life is nasty,
brutish and short.

467
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,770
This is A compliment to the discussion 
of the metaphysics of pepe.

468
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:43,870
The frog that I had with Dr.
Jordan Peterson.

469
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,860
There are strains,
transformations happening our world,

470
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,700
and hopefully understanding them will 
prevent the worst from taking shape.

471
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,610
As I discussed with Dr.
Peterson,

472
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,810
the frog is a type of hybridity as an 
amphibian.

473
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,030
It exists in two worlds.
At the same time,

474
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:06,570
so it becomes an image of the margin.
Another possible aspect of the margin 

475
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:12,211
and the monster as we encounter it,
is to be a shapeshifter shapeshift 

476
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:17,620
shifting like hybridity is the sign of 
the place where categories fall apart on

477
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:20,410
the edge.
In the case of shape shifting.

478
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:24,520
This characteristic because presented 
mostly as a power of the margin,

479
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,060
is the power of fluidity like a 
trickster,

480
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,880
taking on several forms to operate his 
mischief.

481
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,500
To fully understand how pepe the frog 
operates,

482
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:41,190
we need to understand how shape shifting
occurs and how it gives power to those 

483
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,180
who wield it.
You see,

484
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:48,181
pepe has become a meme,
possibly the most used meme of all 

485
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,811
times,
his images floating on the internet and 

486
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,260
it can be produced by anyone in the 
world,

487
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:59,230
and so there are thousands and thousands
of images of pepe ranging from a 

488
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:04,321
glorified emoji to the most horrifying 
scatological images you can imagine 

489
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,690
because pepe has become this chaotic,
fluid shape shifting thing.

490
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:16,380
He ends up acting like a mirror in the 
same way water acts as a mirror,

491
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,670
and the way that works is that because 
there are so many images of pepe,

492
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,840
when people look into that huge chaos of
images,

493
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,960
they can't encompass it,
all of it.

494
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,500
They have to mentally order it and in 
ordering it they do that using their own

495
00:22:37,801 --> 00:22:42,801
mental patterns,
but as they project their thinking into 

496
00:22:42,801 --> 00:22:47,481
this chaos and as they forced the chaos 
to take shape becomes an image of their 

497
00:22:50,341 --> 00:22:54,450
own ideas,
maybe their own ideological possession,

498
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:01,930
and so one of the things that has been 
happening is that some people on the 

499
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:06,311
right what,
what some groups are calling the alt 

500
00:23:06,311 --> 00:23:10,020
righter or whatever have been using this
effect to act as a mirror against the 

501
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,951
social justice warrior types and even 
went so far that the sjws finally 

502
00:23:17,361 --> 00:23:22,361
declared pip a hate symbol.
The aNti defamation league said that 

503
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,190
pepe was a hate symbol.
I mean this frog,

504
00:23:25,191 --> 00:23:30,191
this cartoon frog.
It was so ridiculous that the adl 

505
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:32,810
finally scaled back.
Some of the language they use.

506
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,270
I mean,
of course it was politically motivated,

507
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,080
but how could such a silly thing happen?
Well,

508
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,080
certain images of pepe,
a few of them in the thousands,

509
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,200
thousands of images available had racist
themes and so there was a hitler pepe 

510
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,390
and a k,
k,

511
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:59,391
k dot pepe,
scheming jus african stereotyped using 

512
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:01,890
racist slurs,
cliche mexicans.

513
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,640
All of these examples were floating with
the other thousands and thousands of 

514
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,170
peppa images online,
but when the social justice warriors 

515
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:15,450
looked in this mirror,
this pond of pepe images,

516
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:21,260
all they could see were the ones that 
reflected back to them their own 

517
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,440
ideology or rather like a mirror,
an inversion,

518
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,380
the dark shadow of their ideology.

519
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,930
Of course,
immediately the accusation came that bay

520
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:37,931
is a racist symbol.
He's a hate image and the irony is very 

521
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:41,030
big because first of all,
no one controls this image.

522
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:47,020
No one has any control over it.
Pepe is everything and anything and 

523
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:52,541
nothing at the same time by declaring 
publicly that he's a hate symbol.

524
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,710
That's two are pointing to their own 
absurdity and this to the delight of 

525
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:03,731
those that use this image,
but heidi in this is an even larger ird.

526
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,160
If you look at the images that they 
pulled out as being racist images.

527
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,970
There's this strange contradiction in 
though.

528
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:20,770
You see on one side there is hitler pepe
and kkk pepe,

529
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,290
and there's a trump pepe.
Well,

530
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,470
on the other side,
there's the scheming jew,

531
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:29,050
the african american,
and the mexican.

532
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:36,030
This means that pepe is that the same 
time the archetipal oppressor seemed 

533
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:42,330
from the side of the victim,
all the while being the archetypical 

534
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,650
scapegoat seen from the side of the 
oppressor,

535
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:50,430
that it's pepe is both sides of racism.
At the same time,

536
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,520
when the sjws look at that automatically
without even thinking,

537
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:02,980
they organize it through the ideology 
and it exposes their program because the

538
00:26:03,381 --> 00:26:08,090
automatically decide that when pepe is 
hitler or kick a care,

539
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:11,570
trump pipa is identifying with those 
people,

540
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,570
but when he's a scheming jew or a 
mexican,

541
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,990
pipa is mocking and criticizing those 
people.

542
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:24,930
Why is such an absurd image of hitler as
a cartoon frog not seen as mocking 

543
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:25,300
hitler,

544
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,420
in fact,

545
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,560
all the stw users seeing is a reflection
of themselves,

546
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,200
of their nightmare,
of their shadow.

547
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:42,980
The rather pathological desire we've 
seen in the past few months to accuse 

548
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:47,540
everyone being hitler or a neo nazi or a
white nationalist is an expression of 

549
00:26:47,761 --> 00:26:52,761
their secret desire,
the desire to be confirmed through an 

550
00:26:52,761 --> 00:26:57,081
encounter with their projected other,
and it's funny because the discourse of 

551
00:26:58,051 --> 00:27:03,051
otherness has been an ideological tool 
of the left since the 19 sixties and now

552
00:27:05,911 --> 00:27:09,480
we're at a time when it has come back to
haunt them.

553
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,640
So by using this strategy,
the people have been wielding this 

554
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,040
pepper image have taken advantage of the
power of chaos,

555
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:25,670
taken advantage of what happens when the
frog jumps into the pond and goes down 

556
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:31,161
to the bottom to find the golden ball.
As I explained in my interview with Dr.

557
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,070
Peterson about the story of the princess
and the frog,

558
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,600
but the frog can't stay in the water 
forever.

559
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,620
That's the most important thing.
At some point you have to finish the 

560
00:27:48,201 --> 00:27:48,830
story

561
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:56,080
to finish the story of the frog has to 
get the golden ball and one could say 

562
00:27:56,961 --> 00:28:01,961
that the golden ball is actually the sun
which will come up for the new day.

563
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:09,220
The frog has to get the golden ball and 
bring it back to the surface of the 

564
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,920
water.
It must carry the most important thing,

565
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:17,750
carry the seed of the new world to the 
princess so that it can grow.

566
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:24,400
If that doesn't happen,
there is no telling what else can come 

567
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,990
out of the water.
If the frog stays there for too long,

568
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:32,670
it will be eaten or it will call some 
dark or monster because there are other 

569
00:28:33,951 --> 00:28:38,540
things down there beside the golden ball
and the frog contempt,

570
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:43,541
the leviathan to devour it,
and it's not as if this is impossible.

571
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:50,950
As the frog swims in the darkness,
the social justice warriors still 

572
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:54,380
peering into the mirror and calling 
forth its shadow.

573
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,300
You've already seen some intimations 
that this game,

574
00:28:59,301 --> 00:29:03,170
people are playing my race,
something more than a new day.

575
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,410
Mike,
raise the very monster,

576
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:11,411
the social justice warriors hope to 
encounter so as the frog swims in the 

577
00:29:14,651 --> 00:29:15,670
water.
How?

578
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:20,910
How can it do that?
How can it recognize the golden ball 

579
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:24,570
that is at the bottom of the pond 
because it's actually not easy to 

580
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:27,580
distinguish things when we're covered in
darkness

581
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,890
and the answer to this is in what 
happens in the story.

582
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:39,540
The frog has to get out of the water and
become a prince.

583
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:45,290
The frog has to become something else 
and bringing up the golden ball is the 

584
00:29:46,011 --> 00:29:49,280
same thing as the transformation of the 
frog into a prince.

585
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:55,490
One cannot happen without the other,
and so as Dr.

586
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,940
Peterson is often suggested in his 
lectures,

587
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,450
the way to do it is to sort ourselves 
out,

588
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,900
is to go into our own self,
define the golden ball that is hidden in

589
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:15,631
the darkness,
to go down and find the most important 

590
00:30:17,031 --> 00:30:22,031
thing of western civilization.
And Dr.

591
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Peterson has suggested the most 
important thing of western civilization 

592
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,230
is the logos.
This truth,

593
00:30:31,231 --> 00:30:36,231
that is the Word we have seen.
How noise has been the chaos used to 

594
00:30:37,321 --> 00:30:38,340
drown the word.

595
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,380
What I'm going to talk about,
what is freedom of speech?

596
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:46,180
I want to tell you a few things about 
taking off this very carefully.

597
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:55,110
I've been thinking about this very 
carefully over the last two weeks 

598
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,550
because of the videos,

599
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:09,310

00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,480
The word is the thing that comes out of 
death and lives again.
