I'm Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, a
professor at the University of Toronto.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,520
I'm a clinical psychologist and
author of the bestselling book,

3
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:09,930
12 rules for life,

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,820
which has sold more than 3 million
copies worldwide being translated into 50

5
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:19,650
languages and which I have lectured
live about 150 cities all over North

6
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:22,950
America, Europe,
Australia, and New Zealand.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,900
I've also produced a series of popular
podcasts which will now be featured

8
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:32,010
weekly on the Westwood One
podcast network every Sunday,

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,370
and which I will be hosting with
my daughter Mikayla Peterson.

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,320
If you want to understand yourself and
other people far more deeply and keep

11
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:44,190
abreast of the latest scientific
discoveries and philosophical ideas,

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,570
then the Jordan would be Peterson podcast
on Westwood one might be just what

13
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:53,370
you're looking for. It's a call to
individual responsibility, courage,

14
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:56,760
and truth in the face of the
trouble and tragedy of life.
