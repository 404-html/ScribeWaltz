00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:05,503
Hi everyone.
Welcome to the October version of the q 

2
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,950
and a.
Um,

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,960
hopefully all my technology will work.
It's amazing that it ever does.

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,390
Q and.
A.

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,560
Um,
hopefully all my,

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,673
apparently it is good.
So let me catch you up to date on some 

7
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:31,454
news first.
That would be fun as far as I'm 

8
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:36,410
concerned.
So the first thing I want to do is share

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,440
something with you and that's this.
So I got this in the mail yesterday from

10
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:47,420
Penguin UK,
from an editor,

11
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:48,254
nick skidmore,
who I've been working with for several 

12
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:50,923
months.
And so this is the 50th anniversary 

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,153
version of Alexander Solzhenitsyn's 
Gulag archipelago in it's abridged form 

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,420
one volume abridged form,
which he approved.

15
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,053
Um,
it's also published on the centenary 

16
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,050
centenery of his birth and I was invited
to write a foreword to it,

17
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:16,580
which I completed and which seemed to 
meet with dissatisfaction of the editors

18
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:19,490
and also soldier Knutson's family.
Um,

19
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,353
it's about

20
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,903
500 pages long,
which is much shorter than the original 

21
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:27,680
book,
which was about 1800 pages.

22
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,320
And uh,
Solzhenitsyn's approve the abridgment.

23
00:01:30,321 --> 00:01:35,060
I think I might've said that.
So it's a remarkable piece of literature

24
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:35,894
and history and arguably the most 
influential historical document of the 

25
00:01:41,661 --> 00:01:43,700
20th century.
You could make that case.

26
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,043
And so it was really unbelievably,
it was an unbelievable privilege to be 

27
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:51,410
asked to write the foreword.
And I hope that I did a credible job.

28
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,460
We'll see about that.
It's on sale as of November 1st now I've

29
00:01:55,461 --> 00:01:59,960
also prepared a youtube video for it 
where I've read the foreword and some of

30
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:02,510
the content of the book to provide 
people with an introduction.

31
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,883
And I'm hoping that this will be 
something approximating a literary 

32
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:07,694
event.
So I invite you to pick up the book if 

33
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:13,100
you'd like to and um,
and prepare to be

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,433
shocked to your core,
I suppose is the proper way of thinking 

35
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:20,540
about it.
So there you go.

36
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,090
So that's that.
Next thing.

37
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,630
I was in New York the other day 
yesterday,

38
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:27,464
literally finalizing what I hope is a 
deal for my second book and perhaps 

39
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:34,760
books after that,
but certainly for the second book,

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,800
which is tentatively entitled
12 more rules for life.

41
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,050
There you go.
Um,

42
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,980
originally there were 42 rules and

43
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,400
I haven't used them all up,
so there's plenty of reason for

44
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,430
continuing as far as I'm concerned and 
I've written a bit of it and it seems to

45
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:04,990
be going well and I'm hoping that I can 
do a better job with the second book.

46
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:05,824
That's the goal and that's what I 
discussed with the editorial team is 

47
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:08,644
that I want the next book to be 
substantially better than the last one 

48
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:15,580
was.
Hopefully I can manage that.

49
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,683
So that's well and good as well.
I'm hoping that I'd have that book done 

50
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:20,974
by next September,
something approximating that maybe for 

51
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:28,600
publication the following January.
Now I've got a year after that if I need

52
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:31,390
it depending on what happens this year.
But that's the plan.

53
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,410
And then I'm going to tell you a little 
bit about what's happening

54
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,150
with me
over the next,

55
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,583
I suppose year really it,
I might as well tell you that maybe 

56
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:45,400
your,
you'd be interested in knowing.

57
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,570
So the first thing is,
is that tonight I'm going with Tammy,

58
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,613
my wife,
who's been traveling with me this whole 

59
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:52,491
time.
We've,

60
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:57,310
we've finished 85 cities in the tour so 
far and they've gone really well.

61
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,370
I would say.
So we've spoken to about 250,000 people.

62
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:01,204
I've been traveling with Dave Rubin of 
the Rubin report and that's been 

63
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:04,084
entertaining.
He's very comical and has been a good 

64
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,480
adjunct to add a bit of levity and also 
a certain degree of seriousness,

65
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,583
so that's good.
So on Sunday I'm speaking in Dublin and 

66
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:19,060
on the 23rd that's Tuesday on Oslo.
I'll just go through the cities.

67
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:19,894
You can look up the dates at Jordan,
Pete peterson.com forward slash events 

68
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:24,550
if you want.
Manchester,

69
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:25,900
Oxford,
Glasgow,

70
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,030
Edinburgh,
Amsterdam,

71
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,350
Cambridge,
Helsinki,

72
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:30,910
Stockholm,
Copenhagen,

73
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:32,200
Birmingham,
Oswald,

74
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,093
Stockholm and Helsinki.
So that ends November 11th then I'm off 

75
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:37,084
with Tammy to Spain and Portugal to talk
to book publishers there and then I'm 

76
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:41,554
going to speak to the trilateral 
commission in Slovenia in Lubyanka and 

77
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:47,350
then we're going to Hawaii.

78
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,280
I have a talk in Hawaii in,
that's at the end of November,

79
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,503
then to New York.
Maybe I'm going to talk to doctor Oz 

80
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:55,810
again.
That's not finalized,

81
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:56,644
but it seems probable than I'm going to 
Washington to talk to some people there 

82
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,360
and then to Florida for a bit of a break
from Canadian winter even though I won't

83
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:06,790
have experienced any of that so far this
year.

84
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:07,983
And um,
I have a speaking engagement there as 

85
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:12,520
well.
And then in January,

86
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,354
possibly I'll be in California.
We've applied for a tech incubator in 

87
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:24,301
California to further the development of
our educational software,

88
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,203
which is already at the prototype stage.
I don't know for sure that will be 

89
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:32,380
accepted into the incubator and I don't 
know for sure if we are accepted,

90
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:35,980
if that that's the route we're going 
take because there are other options.

91
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:40,630
We're also working with a private school
consortium to test the software,

92
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,820
um,
as we develop it.

93
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,710
Because when you're developing a 
product,

94
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,840
this is a good thing to know if you ever
do build something,

95
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,230
you want to build a product,
test it with your potential customers,

96
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:52,420
build it again because you've made all 
sorts of mistakes,

97
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:54,280
test it with your customers and so on.
So,

98
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,000
and then after that going to Australia,
New Zealand,

99
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,163
probably to talk in about a dozen places
there and then back to Europe in March 

100
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,260
and April.
And then I'm going to write nonstop,

101
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:09,320
I hope from May to September.
And then with any luck,

102
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:11,900
I'm going to start the biblical series 
again with exodus.

103
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,930
And so that's that,
that's the plan.

104
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,430
So,
um,

105
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,300
it's exciting and daunting and all of 
those things.

106
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,670
So,
um,

107
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,450
now you're up to date and hopefully that
was interesting.

108
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:31,310
I really am thrilled about this.
This is really something then Mitch,

109
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:33,080
really something.
So,

110
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:34,090
um,
and I'm,

111
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:38,300
I'm the soldier knits and family was 
happy with the forward,

112
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:39,134
so that was really
positive and hopefully it'll bring a 

113
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:48,000
whole new audience to the book.
That would be a good thing.

114
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:50,670
This is not something that we should 
ever forget ever.

115
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,480
Okay.
So let's say,

116
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,000
let's go to some questions here.

117
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,830
Any advice for a young counselor as soon
to finish his degree?

118
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,440
What do you wish you knew as a young 
therapist?

119
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,090
Well,
let's start with advice.

120
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,253
Um,
well one thing I would say is you could 

121
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:13,600
go to my book list and read the books 
that are there.

122
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:18,460
There's ad on my website,
there is a list of recommended books,

123
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,323
fiction,
nonfiction and the nonfiction is 

124
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:24,310
categorized in different ways.
There's a psychotherapy section,

125
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,410
I would say read those books.
That's,

126
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,080
that would be helpful.
Those people,

127
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,750
young Freud,
Rogers,

128
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,033
I think there's something by Adler,
unreal and Borchez some of the 

129
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:38,980
existentialists from the 1950s.
Um,

130
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,980
lot of neuroscientists types.
Very,

131
00:07:41,981 --> 00:07:43,270
very smart people.
Very,

132
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:45,040
very useful to know what they had to 
say.

133
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:49,810
So
then the next thing I would suggest,

134
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:52,300
and you've heard this from me before 
perhaps,

135
00:07:52,301 --> 00:07:53,134
is that it's almost impossible to 
overestimate the degree to which merely 

136
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:02,290
listening is helpful if you're a 
counselor.

137
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,850
Lots of people have no one to listen to 
have no one that will listen to them.

138
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:10,480
And that's a real problem because people
actually think by talking.

139
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:14,740
And so for many people who are isolated,
they have no one to talk to.

140
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:17,320
So that means they don't think,
and that means that their,

141
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,920
their thoughts aren't straight and 
organized.

142
00:08:20,921 --> 00:08:24,490
And you might think,
well why does that matter?

143
00:08:24,491 --> 00:08:29,491
But the reason it matters is because the
best analogy I would say to two thoughts

144
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:36,540
is that the best way of conceptualizing 
the structure of your thoughts is to can

145
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,760
consider it in the same manner that you 
might consider a map and your map should

146
00:08:43,601 --> 00:08:45,580
be organized and things should be in the
right place.

147
00:08:45,581 --> 00:08:48,580
Because otherwise when you use the map 
to navigate in the world,

148
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:49,414
you don't end up where you want to be 
and you run into things that you don't 

149
00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:53,710
want to encounter.

150
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,933
And so it's actually necessary to get 
your thoughts in order since they help 

151
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:01,470
you simulate the world before you act in
it.

152
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,850
And so don't underestimate how important
it is just to listen.

153
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:08,190
And then you think,
well let's think about listening to,

154
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:10,500
so someone comes to you and they,
and they come to you because they have a

155
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:13,590
problem.
Now you don't know what their problem is

156
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:16,230
and neither do they.
All you know is that they have enough of

157
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:17,064
a problem to come and talk to you.
So then they might have a problem 

158
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:20,544
because really terrible things have 
happened to them and anyone with any 

159
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:24,024
sense would have a problem.
And so then they have problems in lives 

160
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,050
in,
in life say,

161
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:31,110
or they have the existential problems 
don't really psychological problems,

162
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,063
even though it might be psychologically 
a demanding to adapt to the real 

163
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,170
problems.

164
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,000
You want to listen and you want to find 
out,

165
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:39,834
well what exactly is the problem space 
and how much of that is practical and 

166
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:45,204
how much of it is psychological.
So the first issue is you don't know 

167
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:49,494
what the problem is and you want to ask 
a lot of questions to find out what it 

168
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:53,610
is and,
and,

169
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,563
and also what it isn't.
Because often people will come in and 

170
00:09:57,271 --> 00:10:00,660
they're upset and they don't exactly 
know why they're upset.

171
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:03,240
And they might be upset about a whole 
bunch of things.

172
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,283
And it isn't until after they talk 
through all the things they might be 

173
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:07,824
upset about that they find out what 
they're upset about and what they're 

174
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:13,020
not.
So another reason to listen,

175
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,093
especially at this stage of problem 
formulation is to help people decide 

176
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:17,094
what their problems aren't.
Well then the next thing you have to do 

177
00:10:19,691 --> 00:10:20,820
to listen is like,
okay,

178
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,830
well now we,
we know what the problem is.

179
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,993
Well,
what would your client view as a 

180
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:29,964
potential solution?
So assuming that this could be made 

181
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:36,270
better in some manner,
what would better look like?

182
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:40,770
So you need to develop code,
develop a philosophy of what's better.

183
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,090
And so that's a goal or an aim and it's 
almost like a personalized definition of

184
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:47,190
mental health.
But it might be better to think about it

185
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:49,760
as a personalized definition of,
um,

186
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,710
of a good life.
And so,

187
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:54,870
uh,
that's the next thing you have to listen

188
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:55,704
to about.
And then the last thing you have to 

189
00:10:56,461 --> 00:10:58,470
listen about and negotiated as well as,
okay,

190
00:10:58,471 --> 00:10:59,304
well now we know what your problem is.
And we know hypothetically what the 

191
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:03,594
destination is with regards to solving 
that problem is what are the strategies 

192
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:12,531
that are necessary to implement in order
to make that positive outcome ochre?

193
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,410
And then that's something that you 
negotiate by listening every week.

194
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:16,981
It's like,
okay,

195
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:17,814
well here's the goal.
What steps could we take that you would 

196
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,850
implement that would move you towards 
that goal?

197
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,900
Can you take those steps in the world?
Will you do that this week?

198
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,823
And then watch whether or not you do it 
and come back and report and also tell 

199
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:35,370
me and yourself whether or not 
implementing that actually worked.

200
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,593
And then we can come back and we can 
have a discussion about whether you did 

201
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:40,590
it or not.
And if you didn't,

202
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,540
then how we could modify that.
And if you did,

203
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,420
how we could continue and expanded.
And if you did do it,

204
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:46,254
whether it worked and if it,
if it and what unexpected things 

205
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:49,434
occurred and what if any implications 
there are for understanding problem and 

206
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,260
for your goal.
And so you know you,

207
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,810
you need,
it's a map.

208
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,220
You have a starting point.

209
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,430
You have to figure out what that is.
You have a destination point,

210
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,920
the desired future.
You have to figure out what that is.

211
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,933
You have to implement and design 
strategies that will move the person 

212
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:10,174
forward.
And then you have to test all those 

213
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,000
strategies.
Very strategic thinking,

214
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:15,520
very practical thinking.
And so,

215
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,500
um,
that's,

216
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,850
that's an outline of how to do effective
psychotherapy.

217
00:12:21,851 --> 00:12:24,340
I would say effective,
careful psychotherapy.

218
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,323
And another bit of advice is people 
often who are young counselors are 

219
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,060
afraid and don't know how they can not 
take their client's problems home.

220
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,610
And I've got a couple of things to say 
about that.

221
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:41,611
The first is they're not your problems.
And it's very important to remember that

222
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,930
it's partly you don't want to steal your
client's problems.

223
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:47,711
I mean,
you might think,

224
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:48,544
well,
if I could take my client's problems on 

225
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:52,280
myself and lift the burden from the 
mall,

226
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,290
wouldn't that be better?

227
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,850
And the answer is,
well,

228
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:55,684
no,
because someone's problems are not that 

229
00:12:57,971 --> 00:12:58,804
distinguishable from their life.
And what you're there to do is 

230
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:02,074
facilitate their ability to learn,
to grapple successfully with the 

231
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:09,190
existential vagaries of their own 
existence.

232
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,710
And you don't want to leap in there and 
steal it.

233
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:15,340
Like let's say you give a spectacular 
piece of advice and you're going to give

234
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:17,860
advice now and then,
but it's not that advisable.

235
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,993
Then let's say you advise someone to 
solve a problem in a certain way and 

236
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:23,770
they go do it.
And the problem solved.

237
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:24,700
It's like,
well,

238
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:25,534
the problems disappeared,
but they didn't learn how to generate 

239
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:29,524
the solution to the problem.
And so they're in worst shape with 

240
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:34,680
future problems and it's your victory in
some senses,

241
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,000
stead of theirs.
And so you don't want to,

242
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,020
you don't want to steal from your 
clients destiny.

243
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,423
And so,
and that also frees you up to some 

244
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:44,914
degree because it also means that you're
not morally obligated to take on those 

245
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:49,360
problems and carry them home.

246
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,433
And the other thing is,
is that it doesn't do your client any 

247
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:57,721
good for their problems to sink you.
You have a moral obligation,

248
00:13:58,031 --> 00:13:58,864
an ethical obligation of professional 
obligation to remain sufficiently 

249
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:03,094
detached from the situation so that your
head is clear and you remain healthy 

250
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,360
and,
and your practice remains viable for the

251
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:13,270
long run.
And so don't forget to protect yourself.

252
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,980
It's very,
very important.

253
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,190
Let let your clients sort out their 
lives.

254
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,410
You're there to help.
You're there as a sounding board year.

255
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:22,550
There is a strategic,
uh,

256
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,493
you're there to offer strategic advice.
You're there to shed light on the 

257
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:29,150
symptomatology and to lay out potential,
uh,

258
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,090
strategies for treatment,
all of that.

259
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,380
And so,
uh,

260
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,230
and that's good enough.
You don't take on any more than that.

261
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,430
So,
okay.

262
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,960
Procrastination and instant rule me.
Nothing seems to motivate me.

263
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,250
Nothing seems to motivate me.
What do I do?

264
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,223
Well,
I'm going to give you some practical 

265
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:02,700
advice.
Um,

266
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,823
I would say you need a plan.
Like you need a plan and not just a 

267
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:10,670
plan.
You need a reason to implement the plan.

268
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,480
You need both of those.
So something motivates you.

269
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:17,990
You already said instant gratification 
motivates you.

270
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:20,090
So you'll do things for instant 
gratification.

271
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,253
Now look,
instant gratification is a particular 

272
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:25,970
form of reward.
It's called incentive reward,

273
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:28,610
and it's mediated by dopaminergic 
circuitry.

274
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:29,444
The same circuitry that mediates reward 
as a consequence of using drugs like 

275
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:35,150
cocaine or any of the drugs that people 
abuse.

276
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,980
And so there are certain short term 
activities that are pleasurable enough.

277
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,050
So they produce,
uh,

278
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,423
an intrinsic,
they intrinsically produce a dopamine 

279
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:45,601
kick.
And a lot of that,

280
00:15:45,601 --> 00:15:47,150
it's instantaneous gratification.

281
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,680
Like,
say eating when you're hungry,

282
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,000
at least a taste and flavor of the food.
Because there's also a satiation element

283
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:55,490
that comes along with food.
And so there's those,

284
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:56,324
those pleasures that speak for 
themselves when you're looking at the 

285
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:03,620
long run,
things that are rewards that are delayed

286
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:06,020
don't produce as much of a,
um,

287
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,530
a dopamine kicks.
So they're not as immediately gratifying

288
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:11,060
and they're not as gripping in the 
present.

289
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:16,061
And the way that you have to overcome 
that is to generate a vision of,

290
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:17,150
it's really,
it's not a,

291
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,960
it's not a plan or a strategy,
it's a philosophical vision that,

292
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,100
that,
that,

293
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,750
that justifies your life in some way 
that you deeply believe has to be that.

294
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,643
And it can't be trivial because 
otherwise procrastination and instant 

295
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:30,914
gratification are going to rule you.
So we developed this program called the 

296
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:36,794
future authoring program,
and it's part of the self authoring 

297
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:38,870
suite.

298
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,703
And I'll run through it very rapidly 
because even if you don't use that 

299
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,120
program,
although you could,

300
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:47,030
because that's what it's designed for 
and I think it makes it easier.

301
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,133
It outlines what's necessary in order to
overcome the problem that you're 

302
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:51,704
describing.
So the first question you might ask 

303
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:54,080
yourself is,
well,

304
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,723
what would you need to gain?
And you have to have a real dialogue 

305
00:16:58,071 --> 00:16:58,904
with yourself to understand this.
You'll have to take yourself warts and 

306
00:17:00,651 --> 00:17:03,200
all your useless,
procrastinating,

307
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:07,970
instant gratification seeking self.
And you have to sit down and say,

308
00:17:07,971 --> 00:17:08,804
all right,
you know,

309
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:13,130
you're talking to your inner badly 
behaved six year old.

310
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,053
It's like,
okay,

311
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,043
what is it that you would have to have 
in order to commit to something in the 

312
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:19,880
long run?
What?

313
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,910
What kind of vision of the future would,
would justify sacrifices for you?

314
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:26,931
And you might say,
well,

315
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:27,710
you don't know.

316
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,460
It's like,
okay,

317
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,230
fine.
That's why you have to break it down.

318
00:17:30,231 --> 00:17:33,020
So let me ask you some questions.
So you might think,

319
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:33,854
well,
here's some things that people need in 

320
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:38,180
their life because your life is not 
going to be solid,

321
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,790
grounded,
gratifying,

322
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,100
acceptable,
meaningful,

323
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,800
relevant,
and uh,

324
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:51,250
devoid of earth,
shaking anxiety without managing some of

325
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,194
these things.
Most people need an intimate 

326
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:54,384
relationship,
a long term intimate relationship 

327
00:17:56,761 --> 00:18:00,510
because otherwise they get lonesome and 
board and crazy,

328
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,620
crazy in a different way than you get if
you have a longterm relationship.

329
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,000
Worst,
crazy.

330
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,640
Um,
they need friends,

331
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,430
they need family.
So that could be your,

332
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:13,080
your birth family,
your parents,

333
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,970
your extended family,
your siblings,

334
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,950
but also children.
So you need to,

335
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,120
to know,
well,

336
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,600
where does that fit into your life?
What's your vision for that?

337
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,770
Do you wanna get along with your 
parents?

338
00:18:22,771 --> 00:18:24,060
You want to get along with your 
siblings?

339
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,460
Do you have a strategy for that?
Do you want to have kids?

340
00:18:26,461 --> 00:18:28,980
At some point?
You want to build yourself a family?

341
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,040
Okay,
you need a job or a career.

342
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,470
Now a career is intrinsically meaningful
and,

343
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,490
and,
and,

344
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,750
and usually very demanding in terms of 
commitment and hours,

345
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,960
whereas a job at least can be engaging 
in worthwhile.

346
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,940
Um,
it's usually more time limited.

347
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:46,560
Maybe you have more freedom outside of 
it,

348
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:50,130
but you need a job because you need 
something to do and you need some,

349
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:52,710
some routine and you need some financial
support.

350
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:54,540
And if you can have a career and that's 
what you want,

351
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,374
so much the better.
But at least at least you could have a 

352
00:18:57,091 --> 00:18:59,130
trade,
something worthwhile,

353
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,800
not that a trade can't be a career.
And believe me,

354
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:03,780
I've got nothing against traits.
Um,

355
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,050
you need to take care of yourself 
mentally and physically.

356
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,330
Like how do you want to present yourself
in the world?

357
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,703
No,
you want to be healthy mentally and 

358
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,040
physically so that you're like a light 
among men.

359
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,240
Let's put it that way.
That would be a good goal.

360
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,573
Um,
how are you going to handle the 

361
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:22,680
temptations of drugs and alcohol and 
whatever,

362
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:23,514
procrastination and instant 
gratification or tilting you in the 

363
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:27,930
wrong direction.
So those are,

364
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,170
you know,
seven things that you might consider sit

365
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,810
down.
Here's the question.

366
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,810
You're taking care of yourself,
like you or someone you care about.

367
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,840
You can design a future that would be 
good for you.

368
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:42,120
If you were taking care of yourself,
right?

369
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:44,130
For 20 minutes,
you can have what you want.

370
00:19:44,131 --> 00:19:47,130
It's three years down the road.
You can have whatever you want,

371
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,410
but you have to aim for it and work for 
it,

372
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,580
and you have to specify it.

373
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,800
What is it?
What do you want?

374
00:19:52,801 --> 00:19:55,140
What would make your life worthwhile?
What would be good enough?

375
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:55,974
So that instant gratification would be 
an obstacle instead of a means for 

376
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:00,360
proceeding.
Like,

377
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:02,190
I can give you an example to some 
degree.

378
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:03,024
You know,
when I was kid in my early twenties I 

379
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:05,940
did,
I,

380
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,010
I did quite a bit of drinking and 
partying.

381
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:12,840
I came from a hard drinking background 
up in northern Alberta and um,

382
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,390
you know,
I was out three times a week even when I

383
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:16,224
was in graduate school and I was 
beginning to write seriously scientific 

384
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:19,824
papers and also the work that became 
maps of meaning and eventually 12 rules 

385
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:23,454
for life.
And it came to the point where I 

386
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:28,950
couldn't do both.
I couldn't go out and be that social and

387
00:20:28,951 --> 00:20:32,220
have that much instinct,
instant gratifying,

388
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:35,550
fun,
and be in good enough shape so that if I

389
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:38,880
was editing something complex,
I was making it better instead of worse.

390
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,590
And I was really interested in what I 
was doing.

391
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:41,424
I was learning a lot about the brain.
I was learning a lot about alcohol and 

392
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:44,184
drug abuse.
I was laying out the platform for the 

393
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:47,484
relationship narrative and neuroscience 
and it was really engrossing and 

394
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:54,100
engaging,
but it was hard and it was long term.

395
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,070
I mean it was a longterm plan or I had 
to make a choice.

396
00:20:57,071 --> 00:21:00,670
It was either continue the fund,
which was fun.

397
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,533
I really enjoyed it or do this thing 
that I really believed was more 

398
00:21:05,621 --> 00:21:10,600
worthwhile and it was more worthwhile to
do the more worthwhile thing,

399
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:13,150
which is why I stopped with the,
it's instant gratification,

400
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,240
like a lot of stopping,
and this is true for most people,

401
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:19,810
especially young men who tend to drink a
fair bit and carouse around a lot.

402
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,393
Most young men stop that sort of thing,
at least to some degree around 25 or 26 

403
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,080
and the reason they do that is because 
they pick up other responsibilities.

404
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,913
They get a real job that has some future
and they get a relationship that's 

405
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,420
permanent.
They have a family and they decide,

406
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,373
well,
that's more important than the 

407
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,580
procrastination and the instant 
gratification.

408
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,820
Okay,
so make yourself a damn plan.

409
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,683
Make it into a strategy.
You could use the future authoring 

410
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:47,620
program if you like.
I would highly recommend that.

411
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,160
Do it badly.
You might be intimidated by it.

412
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:52,570
You know?
I don't know how to plan.

413
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:53,111
It's like,
yeah,

414
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,540
we know you don't know how to plan.
Make a bad plan.

415
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,510
It's better than the one you've got,
so,

416
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,600
so do it badly and then try and modify 
it as as needs be and see if that works.

417
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:05,320
You need a philosophy,
cody.

418
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,660
That's the thing.
You know you're,

419
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:12,100
you're living in a shallow life and so 
short term avoidance,

420
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:12,963
that's procrastination.
You'll do that because you don't think 

421
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:16,360
it's important enough.

422
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,063
You don't think that the negative 
consequences of not doing what you 

423
00:22:20,711 --> 00:22:23,050
should do are severe enough.
You're not afraid enough of it.

424
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,000
The other thing you do in the future 
authoring program,

425
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:28,210
by the way,
is right about just exactly what kind of

426
00:22:28,211 --> 00:22:31,990
hell you'd be likely to descend into 
three to five years in the future.

427
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,943
If you let your bad habits,
procrastination and instant 

428
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:35,944
gratification,
let's say rule you and take you out of 

429
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:39,784
the game completely because you also 
need to be terrified as well as hopeful 

430
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:45,310
about what you might do if you got your 
act together.

431
00:22:45,311 --> 00:22:49,060
You need to be terrified about what you,
where you might end up if you kept being

432
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,400
like lazy and useless,
you know,

433
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,430
and shallow and that none of that's 
good.

434
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,220
So you need to be deeper and you need to
look deeper.

435
00:22:57,221 --> 00:23:01,640
You need to,
Nisha said he who has a why can bear any

436
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:02,474
how,
and you need a why and the why is 

437
00:23:04,331 --> 00:23:05,170
something like,
well,

438
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,850
imagine you could have the life.

439
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,833
Imagine you could have a life that would
be worth giving up some of the instant 

440
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:14,350
gratification for even in principle,
what would that look like?

441
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,450
So,
all right.

442
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,413
All right.
What do you think the Feminine Hero 

443
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,483
Journey is?
Do you believe females have their own 

444
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:23,830
archetypal story to follow?
Well,

445
00:23:23,831 --> 00:23:25,030
yes,
they certainly do.

446
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,070
I think the,
the first of all,

447
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:32,071
they have the hero story like men do.
But I think,

448
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,750
I think the,
the classic hero story if,

449
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:35,584
imagine it this way,
the classic hero's story is the 

450
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:38,014
archetypal male story with,
with the feminine lurking in the 

451
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:44,890
background.
Cause like men are adventurous heroes,

452
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,123
all things considered fundamentally.
But they're also very maternal men take 

453
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:53,810
care of children,
families for very long periods of time.

454
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:55,460
So as far as,
um,

455
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,400
if you think about this from a purely 
biological perspective,

456
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:03,401
human males are very maternal.
So both males and females have an aspect

457
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:09,110
to them that's archetipal typically 
masculine and archetypically feminine.

458
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:13,640
And I would say in the typical male,
the archetype of the masculine dominates

459
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,740
with the archetypically feminine in the 
background.

460
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:18,140
And then the typical female,
it's the reverse.

461
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,320
And so although there might be some 
variation in that,

462
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:22,340
you know,
you,

463
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,173
you get the relatively rare female who's
more archetypally male in their 

464
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,083
orientation to the world and you get the
relatively rare male who is more 

465
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:34,580
archetypally female,
feminine.

466
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:35,923
So the Dragon,
the conflict with the dragon is the 

467
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:40,620
archetipal male story.
Go Out,

468
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,490
confront the drag and get the gold,
bring it back to the community,

469
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,230
rescue the Virgin,
uh,

470
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,173
enable the community.
Why make yourself wise as a consequence 

471
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:53,930
of the adventure and develop your 
character?

472
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,820
That's a great story.
Um,

473
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,103
the archetypal feminine narrative at 
least to some degree is beauty and the 

474
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:00,764
beast,
which is to encounter the monstrous 

475
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:09,220
masculine and to tame and civilize it so
that there,

476
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,110
so that a joint relationship can be 
established.

477
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,320
That's part and parcel of the 
development of longterm intimacy.

478
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,290
And that would be partly for the 
purposes of intimacy,

479
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:25,850
which is particularly important to 
people say who are high in agreeableness

480
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:30,260
and women are higher in agreeableness,
but also as the platform for,

481
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,400
um,
for raising children successfully.

482
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:39,200
Now you get a male variant of that,
which is one of the male variants of the

483
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:40,690
same story that,
uh,

484
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,180
Eric Norman in particular talked about.
He was a union commentator.

485
00:25:44,181 --> 00:25:46,610
He wrote a book called origins and 
history of consciousness,

486
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,430
which I would highly recommend that's on
my list of recommended readings.

487
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,160
And another one called the great mother,
another brilliant book,

488
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,673
uh,
noise and talked about something called 

489
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:58,340
the crystallization of the anima from 
the great mother archetype.

490
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:02,210
And so you might say that that men 
who've been dominated by women,

491
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,550
a young boy who's been dominated by his 
mother,

492
00:26:04,551 --> 00:26:06,080
for example,
or a man for,

493
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,513
for who,
who for some reason is dominated and 

494
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:14,720
intimidated by the idea of the rejecting
feminine.

495
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,393
And if you're interested in that idea,
you could watch a documentary called 

496
00:26:18,771 --> 00:26:19,604
crump.
You'll see exactly what I mean by 

497
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,470
dominated by the archetipal rejecting 
feminine.

498
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:25,304
I'd never seen a better example of it 
that then and what's laid out in that 

499
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:32,150
documentary crump to brilliant 
documentary.

500
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,620
So the female is a hostile judge and 
very critical of men.

501
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,670
The Feminine Speaking Archetipal 
[inaudible].

502
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:43,340
And so the man has to steel himself to 
face that rejection,

503
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,363
to develop his character.
Just like a Bill Murray does in 

504
00:26:47,131 --> 00:26:49,320
groundhog day.
Exactly the same story.

505
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,513
And then free the individual woman with 
whom he has a relationship from the 

506
00:26:55,141 --> 00:26:55,974
archetipal judgemental feminine.
So that's like the male version of 

507
00:27:00,061 --> 00:27:02,250
beauty and the beast.
And so then,

508
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:05,430
and the female version,
obviously the hero archetype is the fact

509
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:06,264
that women do have heroic role to play 
in the world as well because they 

510
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:13,590
confront the unknown just like men do 
and Garner,

511
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,600
um,
wisdom,

512
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:18,360
knowledge,
riches as a consequence.

513
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,970
But the way I look at it is that,
well,

514
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:21,923
for females,
the feminine archetype is at the 

515
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,070
forefront and the masculine at the 
background and,

516
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,280
and it's reversed for men.
So that's,

517
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,173
that's how it looks to me.
So you caught some twitter flack for 

518
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:39,000
your comment on Brett Kavanaugh care to 
address your comment and the blowback?

519
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:39,923
Well,
I addressed the comment because I wrote 

520
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:44,730
a blog post and so that was probably the
right way,

521
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,593
not only to address it,
but that would have been the right way 

522
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:48,670
to handle it to begin with.
So I'll,

523
00:27:48,671 --> 00:27:49,740
I'll,
I'll address it.

524
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,940
Sure.
I'll address it and all address the blow

525
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:54,840
back as well.
Look.

526
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,153
Okay.

527
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:58,400
Okay.

528
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,233
Just because you have an idea doesn't 
mean that it's the only idea and just 

529
00:28:05,211 --> 00:28:08,990
because you have an idea doesn't mean 
it's right.

530
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,440
And so like it's weird for me in some 
sense to engage in public discourse,

531
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:18,260
especially politically because you see,
I'd been in,

532
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,650
I'd been a researcher for a very long 
period of time and so most of the people

533
00:28:21,651 --> 00:28:25,910
that I've talked to about serious ideas,
most of them,

534
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,200
many of them have been researchers,
graduate students for example.

535
00:28:30,201 --> 00:28:34,670
And when you're talking about a problem,
whatever it might be,

536
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:35,504
if your research oriented,
what you do is kind of what you do if 

537
00:28:39,081 --> 00:28:39,914
you're a therapist.
The way I laid out advice for a young 

538
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:43,610
therapist earlier,
it's like,

539
00:28:43,611 --> 00:28:44,444
okay,
well what does everybody think the 

540
00:28:47,181 --> 00:28:49,410
problem is?
And so you,

541
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:51,440
you assume that you don't know.
It's like,

542
00:28:51,441 --> 00:28:52,274
okay,
well we have big discussion about what 

543
00:28:52,911 --> 00:28:54,590
everybody thinks the problem is.
Well,

544
00:28:54,591 --> 00:28:55,424
what do you think the real problem is?
Like what's the real problem with the 

545
00:28:58,431 --> 00:29:01,700
cavenaugh situation?
Well one might be,

546
00:29:01,701 --> 00:29:02,534
well cavenaugh was accused of sexual 
impropriety when he was a high school 

547
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:10,640
student and because of that,
he's not his suitability for the Supreme

548
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,220
Court is in question.
Maybe that's the problem.

549
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,390
Yeah,
maybe.

550
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:18,020
And maybe that's not the problem.
Who the hell knows what the problem is?

551
00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:20,450
So here's a bunch of possibilities.
Um,

552
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,080
we haven't had a reasonable discussion 
about what constitutes an acceptable,

553
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:27,363
a statute of limitations with regards to
accusations of misbehavior between 

554
00:29:32,921 --> 00:29:34,030
individuals.
It's like,

555
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,193
well,
can you accuse someone reasonably five 

556
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:39,130
years later,
10 years later,

557
00:29:39,131 --> 00:29:42,130
15 years later,
40 later.

558
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,050
Like is there a limit?
Do you,

559
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,690
is there a more,
do you have a moral obligation if you're

560
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:47,524
going to accuse someone or even seek 
justice to do that within a reasonable 

561
00:29:52,271 --> 00:29:54,310
period of time?
Who knows?

562
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,470
We don't.
So that's a problem.

563
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,783
Um,
what exactly are the rules that govern 

564
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,710
the conduct of men and women when 
they're young,

565
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,580
when they're drinking?
Are we going to have that conversation?

566
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,533
No,
we're not going to have that 

567
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:08,824
conversation either because no one wants
to think that through and they 

568
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:13,060
especially don't want to think it 
through.

569
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,013
With regards to the complicating 
additional feature of alcohol thing 

570
00:30:17,171 --> 00:30:18,004
about alcohol is the reason that people 
drink is so that they can act stupidly 

571
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,933
and have fun.

572
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,643
Now the problem with acting stupidly and
having fun when you're sober is that it 

573
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:31,120
makes you anxious and so you don't do 
it.

574
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,673
But Al calls,
especially for people for whom alcohol 

575
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:35,884
is a good drug,
ramps up the excitement of impulsivity 

576
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,460
and quells the anxiety.
And so people always drink,

577
00:30:42,461 --> 00:30:45,400
often drink because they want to go out 
and be stupid and have fun.

578
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:46,234
And look,
I understand that there's something to 

579
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:49,060
be said for stupid fun,
but it's,

580
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,013
but one of the things that also needs to
be said about it is it's bloody well 

581
00:30:52,361 --> 00:30:55,540
dangerous and so we don't want to have 
that conversation.

582
00:30:55,541 --> 00:30:57,580
We don't have that conversation on 
campuses.

583
00:30:57,581 --> 00:31:01,150
We talk about the rape crisis.
Nobody talks about the alcohol,

584
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:05,230
sexual assault crisis.
If men and women didn't drink together,

585
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:07,900
there'd be virtually no sexual assault.
And in fact,

586
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:08,943
if people didn't drink at all,
there'd be almost no violent crime 

587
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,213
because alcohol contributes to violent 
crime in a manner that you can hardly 

588
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:15,200
imagine.

589
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,800
But 50% of people who are murdered are 
drunk.

590
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,860
And about 50% of the people who do the 
murdering or drunk.

591
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:24,730
And that's probably an underestimate 
because the stats aren't kept that well.

592
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,400
And it also depends.
It depends on how you define drunk.

593
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:30,460
So that could also be a problem.
Um,

594
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:34,390
well the liberals left types,
let's call them the left leaning.

595
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:37,060
Progressive types,
don't want a conservative on the Supreme

596
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:41,380
Court of the left leaning types aren't 
happy that trump won the election.

597
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:42,543
Um,
the conservatives want to rush our 

598
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:44,554
candidate onto the supreme court come 
hell or high water because of the 

599
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,520
November election.
Um,

600
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,260
then there's another problem.
Well,

601
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:51,094
is this about cavenaugh at all?
Or is this about roe and weighed in 

602
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:54,650
about abortion?
Well,

603
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,141
who knows,
right?

604
00:31:56,141 --> 00:31:59,110
It's about all those things.
So it's an unbelievably complicated,

605
00:31:59,111 --> 00:32:04,090
godawful situation.
And so Eric Weinstein and Bret Weinstein

606
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:06,190
were tweeting about this and it was late
at night.

607
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,500
And Eric said,
as far as I can tell,

608
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,350
either way,
this is not going to end well.

609
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,120
And I thought,
oh.

610
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,100
And he said,
is there an alternative?

611
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:16,690
Is there a way out of that?
And I thought,

612
00:32:16,691 --> 00:32:18,040
oh,
that's an interesting question.

613
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:20,020
What might be a way out of that?
And I thought,

614
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:20,854
well,
Calvin was in a rough position because 

615
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:25,960
he can't withdraw obviously and perhaps 
shouldn't,

616
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,470
um,
without his reputation being shattered.

617
00:32:29,471 --> 00:32:32,710
And if he doesn't get nominated,
same thing is life is basically over.

618
00:32:32,711 --> 00:32:34,900
So,
but on the other hand,

619
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,483
he's tangled up in a scandal that's 
sufficient merck and mud so that it 

620
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:43,634
isn't self evident that he can serve as 
a supreme court justice without having 

621
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:52,310
every single one of his decisions,
especially in contentious cases,

622
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,653
produce a tremendous amount of social 
upheaval over the next two or three 

623
00:32:57,051 --> 00:33:00,290
decades.
And it isn't obvious that that's a great

624
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:01,124
move forward.

625
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,810
No,
it might be fine.

626
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,340
I mean,
there's been

627
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,853
controversy around other Supreme Court 
justice nominations and that seems to 

628
00:33:09,681 --> 00:33:12,620
have basically sorted itself out.
And I already said,

629
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:16,100
just because you're thinking something 
through doesn't mean you're right.

630
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:17,361
It's a,
it's a,

631
00:33:17,361 --> 00:33:19,670
it's a simulation.
So I thought,

632
00:33:19,671 --> 00:33:20,504
well if I was in cabinet has position 
and I felt that my candidacy had been 

633
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,480
compromised,
perhaps through no fault of my own,

634
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:32,270
I have not saying anything about his 
innocence or guilt,

635
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,613
but that my candidacy had been 
compromised by this interminable and 

636
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:37,964
ugly scandal.
And that meant that my tenure on the 

637
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,153
Supreme Court might be marked by 
culturally divisive controversy in the 

638
00:33:46,761 --> 00:33:47,594
long run.
Maybe it would be better for me to be 

639
00:33:50,031 --> 00:33:52,010
nominated to say,
look,

640
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,563
it's too murky,
it's too muddy and I don't think the 

641
00:33:55,641 --> 00:33:58,820
country is best served by my accepting 
the nomination.

642
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:03,290
Then the conservatives can nominate 
another candidate,

643
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,530
get their personal on the supreme court.
So there's no necessary lost there.

644
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,543
And perhaps we could move forward with a
minimum relative minimum of 

645
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:11,840
divisiveness.
No,

646
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:17,170
look in my blog I laid out all the 
reasons why that isn't a good idea.

647
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:22,490
Like here maybe if you just give me five
seconds,

648
00:34:22,491 --> 00:34:23,324
I can read some of them.
Cause I tried to make a steel man case 

649
00:34:26,451 --> 00:34:30,380
for why my idea wasn't a good one.
My idea about him withdrawing.

650
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,513
So just give me one second and I'll read
all the potential objections just so 

651
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:37,310
that you know that I've thought them 
through.

652
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:38,803
Um,

653
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,553
okay.

654
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,153
So perhaps the Democrat opposition would
mount a similar campaign against my 

655
00:34:49,981 --> 00:34:51,810
punitive successor.
Well,

656
00:34:51,811 --> 00:34:53,370
that's certainly possible.
I said,

657
00:34:53,371 --> 00:34:54,204
well,
that would provide virtually 

658
00:34:54,601 --> 00:34:58,800
unassailable evidence for the purely 
manipulative and political motivation of

659
00:34:58,801 --> 00:35:01,920
the accusers,
forcing them to duplicate their strategy

660
00:35:01,921 --> 00:35:02,754
as second time.
That would help reveal the machinations 

661
00:35:04,681 --> 00:35:07,350
for what they were in a manner that 
would be virtually in dot.

662
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,813
Undeniable.
Perhaps time is of the essence and 

663
00:35:10,681 --> 00:35:13,590
there'd be no way to place another 
candidate of conservative leaning on the

664
00:35:13,591 --> 00:35:16,920
bench before the November elections as 
they say.

665
00:35:16,921 --> 00:35:18,330
However,
act in haste,

666
00:35:18,331 --> 00:35:21,270
repent in leisure.
Okay.

667
00:35:21,271 --> 00:35:23,400
And then other,
other,

668
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,730
um,
arguments against my position.

669
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,810
Here they are.

670
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:37,050
Oh yes.
If cavenaugh withdrew after being,

671
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,423
here's what might happen,
it would be read as an admission of 

672
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:42,144
guilt on his part.
It would embolden those who would use 

673
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:46,620
reputation destruction as a political 
maneuver.

674
00:35:46,621 --> 00:35:47,454
It would weaken the generally and 
vitally important idea of the 

675
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:50,694
presumption of innocence.
It would indicate weakness on the part 

676
00:35:52,771 --> 00:35:55,950
of the Republicans at a key moment prior
to the November elections.

677
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:00,570
It would mean that an innocent man has 
been successfully pilloried by a mob.

678
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,433
It would validate the use of allegations
of past behavior well past any 

679
00:36:04,591 --> 00:36:05,424
reasonable expiry date as a weapon.
It would destroy the Republican 

680
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:11,130
opportunity to choose a supreme court 
justice hand,

681
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:13,710
the Democrats and unearned victory 
embitter bitter,

682
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:14,544
a large percentage of the conservative 
base who would regard the withdrawal as 

683
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:18,144
a betrayal and last and perhaps least 
violate my own personal adage for what 

684
00:36:22,951 --> 00:36:23,970
that's worth of.

685
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:27,060
Don't apologize if you haven't done 
anything wrong.

686
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,193
Okay,
so I understand the weaknesses of that 

687
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:31,020
position.
Um,

688
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,020
I was putting it forward as a potential 
third alternative.

689
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,913
Now look,
it's perfectly reasonable to put things 

690
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:40,590
to out,
to put things forward as alternatives.

691
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:44,430
That's thinking.
Now having said that,

692
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,650
I made some mistakes.
Okay.

693
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:47,484
So the first mistake was
don't tweet complicated ideas in 140 

694
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:59,280
characters about contentious issues in 
the midst of a controversy at two in the

695
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:00,900
morning.
Right?

696
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:01,763
Bad idea.
And so one of the consequences of this 

697
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:04,584
for me is that I've withdrawn quite a 
lot over the last three weeks from 

698
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:08,370
twitter.
It's twitter,

699
00:37:08,371 --> 00:37:09,204
it's a very dangerous platform.
And so I'm taking a break from it while 

700
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:15,250
I'm reevaluating its utility.
And so I,

701
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,363
I,
cause I talked to my son about this 

702
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:22,140
before and other members of my family 
and we had agreed that I wasn't going to

703
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,710
post anything on twitter that should be 
made into a blog.

704
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,430
But the problem with twitter is that it,
or the problem with me,

705
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,323
who knows where the problem is,
is that twitter invites and facilitates 

706
00:37:34,411 --> 00:37:35,244
impulsive responding.
And so I'm not convinced that it's 

707
00:37:38,461 --> 00:37:43,461
necessarily a good platform for me.
I have all the places that I tend to get

708
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:45,834
into trouble.
Twitter is sort of at the top of the 

709
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,264
list now.
I laid out in my blog why I still use 

710
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:51,774
it.
I feel some moral obligation to the 

711
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,310
almost a million people who follow me on
twitter for example.

712
00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:58,380
And there's an addictive quality to it 
too.

713
00:37:58,381 --> 00:37:59,214
You know,
I'm following a lot of these people in 

714
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:03,630
the intellectual dark web and seeing 
what they're up to and trying to keep an

715
00:38:03,631 --> 00:38:06,540
eye on the cultural climate,
let's say.

716
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:10,590
And it's not easy to figure out for me 
as it sure is the case for all of you,

717
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:11,603
exactly how much you should be exposed 
to such things and how much you should 

718
00:38:14,221 --> 00:38:15,060
protect yourself.

719
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,893
I mean,
a case could certainly be made that I 

720
00:38:17,311 --> 00:38:18,144
should stay the hell off twitter and do 
nothing but write for the next year 

721
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:22,770
cause it's not like I have any shortage 
of things to write about.

722
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,310
So I'm trying to sort that out.
So,

723
00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:28,680
um,
that's my explanation.

724
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,400
And um,
and it could easily be that,

725
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,333
as I said,
it could easily be that the idea that I 

726
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:41,680
put forward wasn't the best idea.
You know,

727
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,710
who knows what the best ideas.
Maybe the best idea was for cavenaugh to

728
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:47,650
do exactly what he did,
who knows.

729
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,113
So,
and more,

730
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,043
you know,
good luck to him and to the Supreme 

731
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,870
Court.
I hope it all stabilizes.

732
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:54,940
That would be lovely.
And it has happened before.

733
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:57,220
And so maybe it will again.
So,

734
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,753
all right,
I took the understand myself test and 

735
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:02,710
have a question.
Okay.

736
00:39:02,711 --> 00:39:03,544
So the understand myself 
tests@understandmyself.com for all of 

737
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:07,344
the,
those of you who don't know is a 

738
00:39:07,871 --> 00:39:08,830
personality test.

739
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,590
It's based on the big five extroversion,
neuroticism,

740
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:13,180
agreeableness,
conscientiousness,

741
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,133
openness.
It breaks each of them down into two 

742
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:18,580
fundamental aspects that have been 
empirically validated.

743
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:19,803
And so you can take that test.
I put a code in the description of this 

744
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:23,811
video.
Uh,

745
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:27,670
I think the code is October.
You can use that code for self authoring

746
00:39:27,671 --> 00:39:31,060
and for understand myself.
And there's a 20% discount for that.

747
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:31,894
So if you want to do that only takes 
about 15 minutes to do the understand 

748
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:35,920
myself tasked,
by the way,

749
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,933
the self authoring program,
that requires more effort and you have 

750
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:42,070
to do that over a number of days.
But you can do it badly,

751
00:39:42,071 --> 00:39:44,050
as I said,
and you need a plan man.

752
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:47,230
You need to know where you are.
That's the autobiographical part.

753
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:49,840
And you need a plan for the future.
So it's worth it.

754
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,390
Even though it's hard,
it,

755
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:54,400
it's not as hard as stumbling through 
your life blindly.

756
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,833
Okay,
I took the understand myself test and 

757
00:39:58,001 --> 00:40:02,950
have a question.
Should I take the results as is and live

758
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:06,040
trying to cope with them or can I try to
change them to some degree?

759
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,010
All right,
so the first thing is I would say,

760
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:09,844
well,
take the results as they are to some 

761
00:40:12,521 --> 00:40:13,930
degree.
Now it depends.

762
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:17,830
Look,
you gotta be careful because if you take

763
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:20,800
a personality test like this and you're 
depressed,

764
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,190
so you know the future looks really 
bleak to you,

765
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:26,500
the president looks bleak.
When you look into the past,

766
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:28,600
almost everything looks negative.
You know,

767
00:40:28,601 --> 00:40:30,490
you're not taking any pleasure in 
things.

768
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,490
You feel bad.
Perhaps even worse in the morning,

769
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,570
you,
you're,

770
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,030
you're,
you can't see any light in your life.

771
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,300
You're very self critical.
Perhaps you're depressed.

772
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,553
Then if you're depressed,
your personality scores are going to 

773
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:45,190
look,
um,

774
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,620
they're going to be skewed as a 
consequence of that.

775
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,453
And so they might be more negative 
because of the mindset that you have 

776
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:53,860
when you take the test then they truly 
are.

777
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,610
So I'm assuming with this answer that 
you're not depressed.

778
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,180
So,
um,

779
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,740
should I take the results as he is in 
live trying to cope with them?

780
00:41:02,741 --> 00:41:03,574
Well,
one thing is you should at least give 

781
00:41:06,101 --> 00:41:10,060
yourself some credit.
It's like you're a particular way.

782
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,120
So let's say you're low in openness.
Just for the sake of argument.

783
00:41:13,121 --> 00:41:15,850
Let's say you're low in openness and 
moderately high in conscientiousness.

784
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,833
You're a more conservative person.
You're probably going to be happier if 

785
00:41:20,321 --> 00:41:22,600
you take a more conservative path in 
life,

786
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:23,980
you're going,
you're not,

787
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:26,230
if you're low in openness,
you not that creative,

788
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,180
you're not going to be interested in 
aesthetics.

789
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,870
You're not going to be interested even 
in ideas to that greater degree.

790
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,040
It's not your area of fascination.

791
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,873
You're more practical and concrete and 
perhaps and also less flighty and less 

792
00:41:39,471 --> 00:41:41,480
prone to,
to create of error.

793
00:41:41,481 --> 00:41:42,980
There's advantages to,
you know,

794
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:45,660
because most creative people,
um,

795
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:46,663
our fonts of ideas that will work and 
that will occupy a tremendous amount of 

796
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:54,380
counter productive time in their 
implementation.

797
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:57,260
That's the downside to creativity,
false positives.

798
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,300
Um,
if you're disagreeable,

799
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,193
well then you're going to try to work 
somewhere where competent 

800
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:07,010
competitiveness is useful.
If you're high in neuroticism,

801
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:07,844
then you're probably going to have to 
find a job where the stress levels 

802
00:42:09,981 --> 00:42:11,390
aren't too high.
If you're introverted,

803
00:42:11,391 --> 00:42:12,224
you want to find a place where you could
work and spend a fair bit of time by 

804
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:15,614
yourself.
You know you want to match your 

805
00:42:17,691 --> 00:42:21,350
environment to your personality.
That's adaptation to some degree.

806
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,710
Now,
if you're really high in neuroticism for

807
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:25,544
example,
and you're too anxious and then there 

808
00:42:27,531 --> 00:42:30,620
are things that you can do about that,
you know that that's something you might

809
00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:31,454
want to.

810
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:36,050
If it's really out of hand,
say if you're 98th percentile or above,

811
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:36,884
something like that,
and it's also making you suffer because 

812
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:41,390
you're too anxious and too risk averse 
and to volatile.

813
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:42,403
You might want to consider something 
like counseling to see if you can get 

814
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:46,604
your anxiety levels down or to learn to 
meditate or to learn to control your 

815
00:42:49,941 --> 00:42:52,070
breathing or or,
or,

816
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,113
or,
or to talk to someone to see if there's 

817
00:42:54,381 --> 00:42:58,730
some physiological reason for that.
Now you can change,

818
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,730
but like if you're introverted and you 
can develop social skills,

819
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:03,650
but you kind of have to do them one at a
time,

820
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,513
you know,
because it's not something that comes 

821
00:43:05,901 --> 00:43:09,080
naturally to you and it might not be 
something that you developed as a child.

822
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,530
You have to consciously plan a social 
strategy.

823
00:43:12,531 --> 00:43:13,341
So you might say,
well,

824
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:14,174
I'm introverted.
I should go out with someone for lunch 

825
00:43:16,881 --> 00:43:17,714
once a week.

826
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,940
I should see friends twice a week,
right?

827
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:20,774
You should.
You need to make a plan for social 

828
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:23,084
interactions.
And if you're extroverted and you can't 

829
00:43:24,951 --> 00:43:27,290
stand being alone,
well then you might practice being alone

830
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:28,124
a little bit so that you can learn how 
to spend some quality time on yourself 

831
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,590
and not be so dependent on the company 
of others.

832
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,560
If you're an agreeable person,
too agreeable,

833
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,460
then you'll need to figure out what it 
is that you want,

834
00:43:40,461 --> 00:43:41,294
what you're resentful about and what you
need to negotiate about on your own 

835
00:43:44,151 --> 00:43:46,670
behalf.
And if you're really disagreeable,

836
00:43:46,671 --> 00:43:51,530
then you might want to think hard about 
consciously deciding that once a week or

837
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:55,280
so you're going to try to do something 
for someone else.

838
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,260
And there's a research literature on 
that actually a,

839
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,113
it indicates quite clearly that if you 
consciously plan to do something 

840
00:44:03,411 --> 00:44:04,244
altruistic on a regular basis,
it does seem to improve overall 

841
00:44:07,191 --> 00:44:07,790
wellbeing.

842
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:08,623
And I think that's particularly 
important for disagreeable people 

843
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:14,300
because they don't do that naturally.
It doesn't come to them naturally.

844
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,100
So I think that you,
the,

845
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:23,120
the general advice is find an 
environment where your temperament works

846
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,750
and then the more specific advices.
While having said that,

847
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,150
it doesn't hurt to expand your 
temperament.

848
00:44:29,151 --> 00:44:29,984
If you're introverted,
you should be able to do extroverted 

849
00:44:32,011 --> 00:44:33,780
people do.
And if you're extroverted,

850
00:44:33,781 --> 00:44:36,870
you should be able to spend time alone.
You should develop those as skills.

851
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,123
If you're an agreeable person,
you should learn how to negotiate for 

852
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:43,830
yourself in a tough minded manner.
And if you're disagreeable,

853
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,753
you should learn to take other people 
into consideration more if you're 

854
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:50,760
unconscientious wouldn't hurt.
To have a schedule,

855
00:44:50,761 --> 00:44:51,594
like a Google calendar and to start 
working on that because la low 

856
00:44:54,601 --> 00:44:57,750
conscientiousness is going to interfere 
with your longterm success.

857
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,670
And if you're hyper conscientious,
well,

858
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:04,170
you might need to learn to relax a 
little bit and to make that a priority.

859
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:06,360
So when,
if you're high in openness,

860
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,283
well,

861
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,740
I don't have a quick answer for what you
do if you're high in openness.

862
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:12,221
Oh,
I do.

863
00:45:12,221 --> 00:45:17,221
I guess I do to some degree,
try to focus on one thing to some degree

864
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,490
on one thing and get good at that.
Because when you're open,

865
00:45:21,491 --> 00:45:22,324
you're flying out all over the place 
latterly and you can easily become a 

866
00:45:25,361 --> 00:45:26,194
dilettante's.
So one of the things you have to do if 

867
00:45:27,341 --> 00:45:31,990
you're high in openness is develop true 
expertise in at least one place.

868
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,273
You can even pick it somewhat arbitrary 
given that you're interested in 

869
00:45:35,201 --> 00:45:36,940
everything.
Commit to something.

870
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:38,103
If you're low in openness and the little
closed off compared to what you should 

871
00:45:41,201 --> 00:45:42,280
be,
a little narrow minded,

872
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,660
let's say,
and conventional.

873
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:46,810
Um,
maybe you should read a book a week.

874
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,090
Join a book club.
That's a good thing to do.

875
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:50,143
Um,

876
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,100
okay,

877
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,390
that's a,
that's a good start.

878
00:45:53,391 --> 00:45:55,270
Join a book club.
Um,

879
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:56,530
and,
and,

880
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:58,700
and,
and open yourself up a little bit.

881
00:45:58,701 --> 00:46:02,120
Go see a movie now and then as well.
That would also be helpful,

882
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:03,470
you know?
And,

883
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,960
and that will widen you out a bit.
And that's important.

884
00:46:05,961 --> 00:46:07,670
You know,
what's important for your career and all

885
00:46:07,671 --> 00:46:08,990
that sort of thing.
You want to,

886
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,273
you know,
your temperament to puts you in a 

887
00:46:11,451 --> 00:46:12,284
certain place in the distribution and it
isn't so much that you want to move the 

888
00:46:15,711 --> 00:46:16,544
place is that you want to move the 
variability so that you can be what you 

889
00:46:21,441 --> 00:46:23,570
need to be when the situation demands 
it.

890
00:46:23,571 --> 00:46:25,130
And that doesn't mean to blow in the 
wind.

891
00:46:25,131 --> 00:46:25,964
It means to be adaptable instead of 
constrained tightly by your biological 

892
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:32,030
predisposition.
And you can learn that it's painstaking.

893
00:46:32,031 --> 00:46:33,740
It,
it requires a lot of effort,

894
00:46:33,741 --> 00:46:35,660
but you can learn it.
So

895
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:44,380
my daughter's school is now teaching 
gender as a social construct for sexes.

896
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:48,110
Avoids naming boys and girls.
What did we do?

897
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:53,200
Leaving is not an option.
Well,

898
00:47:00,971 --> 00:47:03,040
I guess the first question is,
I'm,

899
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,870
I'll,
I'll just take you at your word.

900
00:47:04,871 --> 00:47:07,810
That leaving is not an option.
It certainly might not be an option.

901
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,230
Um,
I would say

902
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,273
your best bet,
and this is a casual piece of advice 

903
00:47:17,521 --> 00:47:19,650
because I don't know your particular 
situation,

904
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:20,933
is to find out how many parents there 
are around who are also not happy about 

905
00:47:27,241 --> 00:47:31,690
this.
And then start to strategize.

906
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,153
I mean,
look,

907
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:39,540
to some degree what people define as 
gender is a social construct.

908
00:47:39,671 --> 00:47:44,671
So let's look at it this way.
So there are things that make men,

909
00:47:45,131 --> 00:47:45,964
men and that make women,
women that are universal across 

910
00:47:48,941 --> 00:47:50,500
cultures.
So let's say,

911
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:53,890
except for tiny variations,
um,

912
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:57,940
external genitalia.
So,

913
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,433
but then there are things that do vary 
across culture with regards to whether 

914
00:48:02,711 --> 00:48:05,230
they're regarded as masculine or 
feminine,

915
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,480
male or female.
And those are more learned.

916
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:11,740
So let's say that external genitalia is 
not a social construct.

917
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,230
It's not learned.
If we can't agree on that,

918
00:48:14,231 --> 00:48:16,540
then we're not going to be able to have 
a discussion at all.

919
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:17,973
So,
but there are some things about male 

920
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:19,594
behavior and some things about female 
behavior that are culture specific and 

921
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:23,860
learned.
And so to that degree,

922
00:48:23,861 --> 00:48:26,770
gender is a social construct.
So,

923
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,560
so you know,
you have to give the devil his due,

924
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:31,203
but
the problem isn't teaching that gender 

925
00:48:34,241 --> 00:48:35,074
is a social construct.
That problem is teaching the gender is 

926
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:40,510
only a social construct and that's just 
wrong.

927
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:42,940
It's absolutely wrong.
As soon as someone's doing that,

928
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:45,070
then you know that you're dealing with 
an idiot log.

929
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:48,730
And the research evidence on that,
for example,

930
00:48:48,731 --> 00:48:49,564
is crystal clear.
Apart from the fact that there are 

931
00:48:50,771 --> 00:48:53,050
morphological differences between men 
and women,

932
00:48:53,051 --> 00:48:55,090
which are quite obvious.
Um,

933
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:58,510
you can name a variety of the men have 
wider jaws,

934
00:48:58,511 --> 00:49:00,700
they have larger teeth,
they can bite harder,

935
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:02,223
they have thicker skulls.
As women certainly can attest to from a 

936
00:49:04,781 --> 00:49:05,614
psychological perspective,
they are more powerful in the upper 

937
00:49:07,961 --> 00:49:08,290
body.

938
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:11,800
They can punch a lot harder there.
They can throw more naturally.

939
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,570
Um,
they're,

940
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,830
they're,
uh,

941
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,300
they,
they tend to weigh more,

942
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:19,090
they tend to be taller.
That's sexual dimorphism.

943
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:23,110
Human beings are relatively sexually 
dimorphic as far as primates.

944
00:49:23,111 --> 00:49:25,150
And other mammals go.
Um,

945
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,040
they,
there's difference in,

946
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:31,350
in obviously a waist to hip ratio,
um,

947
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:34,720
women's elbows or a different angle.
They have finer bones.

948
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:39,040
Women have a subcutaneous layer of body 
fat that men don't have.

949
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,193
Um,
women are a little bit more pain 

950
00:49:42,131 --> 00:49:43,290
resistant,
um,

951
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,940
made more pain tolerant.
They're also,

952
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:46,803
uh,
they also have very high levels of 

953
00:49:48,011 --> 00:49:49,540
stamina.
Um,

954
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,450
women tend to be,
have a little edge in verbal ability.

955
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,910
Men tend to have a little edge in 
spatial ability.

956
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,950
Um,
and then there are,

957
00:49:57,010 --> 00:50:00,040
apart from the straight physiological 
differences,

958
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:03,760
there are psychological differences and 
there's a variety of them.

959
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:07,450
Um,
women are more enthusiastic,

960
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,770
men are more assertive.

961
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:09,693
That's extroversion.
Women are higher in withdrawal and in 

962
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:14,830
volatility.
That's on the neuroticism front.

963
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:17,590
Women are more agreeable and more 
polite.

964
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:21,370
That's on the agreeableness front.
Men are more industrious,

965
00:50:21,371 --> 00:50:24,940
slightly and women are more orderly.
That's on the conscientious front.

966
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:30,120
And women are higher in openness proper 
and men are higher in interest in ideas.

967
00:50:30,681 --> 00:50:35,300
And that's on the openness front.
And those differences aren't huge.

968
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:37,490
There's more overlap between the 
genders,

969
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,580
the sexist than there are.
And there is lack of overlap,

970
00:50:40,581 --> 00:50:45,581
but the differences magnify at the 
extremes and they also um,

971
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:49,220
maximize in societies that are 
egalitarian.

972
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:50,323
And then the biggest difference between 
men and women that we know of 

973
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:52,874
psychologically is that men are more 
prone to be interested in things and 

974
00:50:56,421 --> 00:50:58,580
women are more prone to be interested in
people.

975
00:50:58,581 --> 00:50:59,414
And that's actually quite a large 
difference by psychological standards 

976
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,930
and there isn't any evidence that that 
is socially constructed.

977
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:09,800
The counter evidence is that as you make
society's more egalitarian,

978
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:12,200
those differences actually get bigger 
rather than smaller.

979
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:13,183
And even the London Times three weeks 
ago wrote an editorial describing and 

980
00:51:16,481 --> 00:51:18,770
not yet another study that demonstrated 
that.

981
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:19,604
So that's like six and they're huge,
huge scale studies pointing out that 

982
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,393
this,
the fact that the differences between 

983
00:51:25,971 --> 00:51:26,804
men and women get bigger in more 
egalitarian societies is now one of the 

984
00:51:29,331 --> 00:51:33,200
most well established findings in all of
the social sciences.

985
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,360
Thus demonstrating,
for example,

986
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:36,283
that poor James Damore was correct 
despite the fact that Google fired him 

987
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:45,290
for being accurate in his analysis of 
the scientific literature.

988
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,290
Okay.
So you've got the facts on your side.

989
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,333
Problem is is you don't know what to do.
Well there's only one of you that's not 

990
00:51:52,131 --> 00:51:54,080
a good number.
If you're going to mount a campaign,

991
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:55,183
you annoyed about this.
Well write down exactly what you're 

992
00:51:58,761 --> 00:51:59,594
annoyed about.

993
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,970
What bothers you about this?
Okay,

994
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:03,343
what would you like to have happen?
Because you need to know what the 

995
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:09,080
problem is and you need to know what 
this solution is.

996
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,153
Then you have to start thinking about 
strategy and one strategy is you need 

997
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:16,040
some allies.
You need some people on your side.

998
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:20,450
Now if this is bothering you,
the probability that it's bothering most

999
00:52:20,451 --> 00:52:23,120
people is very high because it's very 
rare,

1000
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:26,750
especially with something like this.
I mean I would say,

1001
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,780
and I think the data's support this is 
that the overwhelming majority of people

1002
00:52:32,781 --> 00:52:36,020
do not believe that gender is a social 
construct construct.

1003
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:40,490
That there are four sexes and that 
avoiding naming boys and girls is a good

1004
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:42,020
idea.
So you've got,

1005
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,390
unless you're in a very progressive 
place,

1006
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:45,493
in which case that's it's own problem,
he got to find some people who would be 

1007
00:52:50,241 --> 00:52:51,650
willing to go to bat with you.

1008
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:55,010
And then you have to find it's a 
political struggle.

1009
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,390
It's a bit of a war.
It's like,

1010
00:52:56,391 --> 00:52:57,920
okay,
who's pushing this?

1011
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,920
Who's the ring leaders for this?
You know,

1012
00:53:00,921 --> 00:53:02,750
it's,
it's certainly possible that most of the

1013
00:53:02,751 --> 00:53:06,260
teachers don't want to do this either.
But they're afraid to say anything.

1014
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:07,453
So I would say there's probably a two 
year campaign and you have to decide if 

1015
00:53:11,661 --> 00:53:14,090
this is something that you want to put 
your time and effort into.

1016
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:15,920
And if you do,
you have to conduct it like a,

1017
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,810
like a war,
you know,

1018
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:19,720
without the violence obviously.
But it,

1019
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,870
but that's the right metaphor.
It's like what's the set of problems?

1020
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:25,423
Who's causing them?
What do you want to have happen as a 

1021
00:53:27,511 --> 00:53:28,830
concept,
as an alternative?

1022
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:31,680
How are you going to tackle this?
You're going to talk to your,

1023
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:34,740
to your local public authorities,
school authorities.

1024
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,650
You're going to talk to the local 
politicians in to talk to the principal.

1025
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,713
Are you going to face down the teachers?
Are you going to do that with more than 

1026
00:53:40,861 --> 00:53:41,694
one of you?
Are you going to have your arguments in 

1027
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:43,980
order,
you know,

1028
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,230
art.
And then on a more personal front,

1029
00:53:46,231 --> 00:53:49,080
what are you going to do with your 
daughter?

1030
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:50,063
How are you going to educate her?
Let's say you decide not to take this 

1031
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:54,090
on,
on the political or public front,

1032
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:58,230
then you have to have a conversation 
with her and find out what she thinks,

1033
00:53:58,231 --> 00:53:59,064
you know,
because she'll be doubtful and dubious 

1034
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:01,314
about all of this.
So a lot of that should be asking her 

1035
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:04,950
questions,
you know,

1036
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:08,520
so yeah,
that's the best I can do with that.

1037
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:14,070
Would you consider adding a list of 
recommended movies to your website?

1038
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:17,760
Yes,
I've thought about that.

1039
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,180
Also a recommended list of books for,
for young people.

1040
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:22,403
Um,
it's on the hypothetical list of things 

1041
00:54:24,871 --> 00:54:26,190
to do.
Um,

1042
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,190
but I haven't done it yet.
So,

1043
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:31,843
and it,
I don't think that it's likely to make 

1044
00:54:33,451 --> 00:54:34,284
it up the priority list for awhile 
because I'm pretty booked out for the 

1045
00:54:36,661 --> 00:54:39,870
next,
who knows how long a while.

1046
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:41,243
Um,
cannot understand myself or other big 

1047
00:54:43,261 --> 00:54:45,690
five test be taken after some time.
Eg,

1048
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:46,524
one to two years and be fairly accurate.
I asked because I believe I have 

1049
00:54:49,021 --> 00:54:49,741
changed.
Well,

1050
00:54:49,741 --> 00:54:50,910
you might've changed.
I mean,

1051
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,530
look,
first of all,

1052
00:54:52,531 --> 00:54:53,364
people do change as they mature.
Personality is relatively stable across 

1053
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:58,494
time,
but relatively stable doesn't mean 

1054
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:02,190
completely stable.
It means that,

1055
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:04,800
you know,
if you were extremely extroverted,

1056
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:09,390
the probability that in five years 
you're going to be extremely introverted

1057
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:13,620
is very low.
But if you were extremely extroverted,

1058
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:14,663
it's conceivable that you know,
in one or two years you'll be a 

1059
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,390
moderately extroverted,
you can move.

1060
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:25,230
And some of that's,
some of that's situational.

1061
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:26,850
Um,
some of it's learning,

1062
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:27,983
some of it's maturation.
So one of the most reliable findings in 

1063
00:55:31,141 --> 00:55:33,960
the personality literature is that as 
people get older,

1064
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:38,220
they get more conscientious,
more agreeable,

1065
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,340
and more emotionally stable,
less neurotic.

1066
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:45,210
And that those three traits clump to 
make a super trade called,

1067
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,253
we called it stability.
So people get more stable as they get 

1068
00:55:48,781 --> 00:55:49,860
older,
you know,

1069
00:55:49,861 --> 00:55:52,710
and I've seen people learn to be more 
conscientious,

1070
00:55:52,711 --> 00:55:55,140
that's for sure that happens.
That happens.

1071
00:55:55,141 --> 00:55:57,090
I think whenever you take people who 
are,

1072
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:58,283
who are young and sort of flighty and 
put them through a rigorous 

1073
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:03,750
apprenticeship program,
you know,

1074
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:04,584
where they disciplined themselves.
And I've seen people become certainly 

1075
00:56:07,441 --> 00:56:12,441
become less lower in neuroticism and 
less agreeable for that matter.

1076
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,610
So,
so yes,

1077
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:15,930
you can take them.
Sure.

1078
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,990
Take it again two years later and,
and,

1079
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,010
and see,
you know,

1080
00:56:20,011 --> 00:56:22,950
the other thing you can do if you're 
really curious about your personality is

1081
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:27,310
have some other people take the 
personality test about you.

1082
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:31,690
Cause you know some things about your 
personality and they're accurate to some

1083
00:56:31,691 --> 00:56:34,240
degree.
Self report has some degree of accuracy,

1084
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:37,930
but then you can get information from 
other people as well.

1085
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,700
And so that's another way of 
determining,

1086
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,140
um,
you know,

1087
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:44,530
if a helping of helping get an accurate 
picture of who you are.

1088
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:45,870
So,
um,

1089
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:50,560
you can change drum,
the more dramatic the change,

1090
00:56:50,561 --> 00:56:53,890
the more effort is required.
That's a good way of thinking about it.

1091
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,180
So,
um,

1092
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:56,650
we know,
for example,

1093
00:56:56,651 --> 00:57:00,070
that you can change Iq with shift in 
socioeconomic status.

1094
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:04,410
So imagine that you have identical twins
separated at birth and you know,

1095
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,253
you put one twin into a relatively well 
off family and one twin into a 

1096
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:09,124
relatively poor family.
And let's assume that being rich has 

1097
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,110
some advantages with regards to 
intellectual development.

1098
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,020
You need a three standard,
if I remember correctly,

1099
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:20,140
you need a three standard deviation 
might be four,

1100
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,003
but you need a three or four standard 
deviation move upward in socioeconomic 

1101
00:57:25,601 --> 00:57:29,620
status to produce a one standard 
deviation increase in Iq.

1102
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,220
So you have to move from something like 
the fifth percentile.

1103
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:34,563
I might have the stats a bit wrong 
because I'm trying to do this on the 

1104
00:57:37,361 --> 00:57:38,194
fly.
You have to move from the bottom fifth 

1105
00:57:40,211 --> 00:57:41,044
percentile to the top fifth percentile 
in wealth to move from average 

1106
00:57:46,451 --> 00:57:49,840
intelligence to 85th percentile in 
intelligence.

1107
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:53,770
So you can change as a consequence of 
the situation,

1108
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:57,940
but the bigger the change,
the more costly and that could be costly

1109
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,370
in terms of resources or effort.
So

1110
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,780
when you like doing a podcast with Elon 
Musk,

1111
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,510
let's start an initiative for this.
Yes,

1112
00:58:07,511 --> 00:58:09,940
I would like to do a podcast with Elon 
Musk.

1113
00:58:09,941 --> 00:58:11,810
I know people who know him,
uh,

1114
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,540
but we've never met.
Um,

1115
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,850
yes,
I'm sure that would be ridiculously fun.

1116
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,340
So if you want to start an initiative 
for that,

1117
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:19,900
you go right ahead.
And who knows,

1118
00:58:19,901 --> 00:58:21,240
maybe it'll bear fruit.
Um,

1119
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:26,470
I am going to be concentrating more on 
my podcast in a few months.

1120
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:30,310
I'm contracting with a professional 
company to develop it so that it,

1121
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:34,480
well for a variety of reasons so that it
moves higher up on the priority list.

1122
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:36,610
So I have a better studio.
Um,

1123
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:39,860
so that I have some staff to help me,
uh,

1124
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:42,610
schedule interviews.
There's lots of people I want to talk to

1125
00:58:42,611 --> 00:58:44,950
authors and scientists and politicians 
and,

1126
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:48,130
and,
and so I'm quite excited about that.

1127
00:58:48,131 --> 00:58:48,970
So,
so,

1128
00:58:48,971 --> 00:58:51,190
and I would love to talk to Elon Musk's,
so,

1129
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,920
um,
I'm sure that would be ridiculously fun.

1130
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:56,560
I would,
I would love to find out.

1131
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:00,520
I'd like to ask him about his thought 
process.

1132
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:01,503
And also I'm really curious about how in
the world he manages to do multiple 

1133
00:59:05,651 --> 00:59:09,400
impossible things because doing one 
impossible thing is impossible,

1134
00:59:09,401 --> 00:59:14,401
but doing like five impossible things is
the product of five impossibilities.

1135
00:59:14,891 --> 00:59:17,020
And that just seems like hyper 
impossible.

1136
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:18,730
But he's managed it,
you know,

1137
00:59:18,731 --> 00:59:19,511
I mean,
think about it.

1138
00:59:19,511 --> 00:59:21,500
Think about what he did.
He built an electric car,

1139
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:22,993
which is like hard,
and then he built a rocket and then he 

1140
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:29,510
blasted the car into space on his rocket
like that.

1141
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:32,420
That's not,
that's not real.

1142
00:59:32,421 --> 00:59:35,960
That doesn't happen.
But it did happen and he did it.

1143
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,930
And so I would really,
I would love to talk to him.

1144
00:59:38,931 --> 00:59:42,230
I think that would be extremely,
extremely interesting.

1145
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:45,380
How do you fight a monster without 
becoming one yourself?

1146
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:47,143
You don't.

1147
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,760
You become a monster by fighting with a 
monster,

1148
00:59:52,761 --> 00:59:55,580
but it's actually a good thing to become
a monster.

1149
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:56,653
You see the differences,
and really this is the answer to your 

1150
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:03,881
question.
You could stay naive and that's not good

1151
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:09,110
because you're vulnerable and you're not
useful if you're naive.

1152
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,040
So that's a bad situation.
So let's say,

1153
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:13,903
well instead of being naive,
you decide you're going to go confront 

1154
01:00:15,921 --> 01:00:16,820
the monster.
Okay,

1155
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:21,710
well the problem with that is that you 
become the monster.

1156
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,480
All right,
so how do you deal with that?

1157
01:00:23,481 --> 01:00:27,290
And the answer is to do it voluntarily 
to do it voluntarily.

1158
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:32,270
Because if you develop your 
monstrousness voluntarily,

1159
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:36,440
then perhaps you can bring it under 
civilized control,

1160
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:39,450
right?
You can integrate those,

1161
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,250
the,
those,

1162
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,173
that capacity for May hem and 
destruction that you develop within 

1163
01:00:45,691 --> 01:00:46,524
yourself.
You can integrate that within a 

1164
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:53,280
comprehensive and properly directed 
practical philosophy.

1165
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:55,980
And so that means that you're 
disciplined,

1166
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,350
you know,
like a warrior isn't a monster,

1167
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,990
so you have to,
you have to align,

1168
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:04,853
you have to discipline your monstrosity,
and you do that by developing it 

1169
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,140
voluntarily.
Look,

1170
01:01:10,141 --> 01:01:13,410
you see this sort of thing happening all
the time in classic hero stories.

1171
01:01:13,411 --> 01:01:15,330
Like if you look at the story of the 
Hobbit,

1172
01:01:15,331 --> 01:01:17,130
for example,
like,

1173
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:19,140
um,
Bilbo,

1174
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:21,990
I think Bilbo is the harbor,
right?

1175
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:23,220
Photos.
The next one.

1176
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:24,720
Let me just look that up.

1177
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:32,041
Yeah.
Okay.

1178
01:01:32,041 --> 01:01:33,540
It's Bilbo good.
That's what I thought.

1179
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:37,080
Now Bill Bolt,
when he starts,

1180
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,393
when this Harvard starts the book,
Bilbo lives in this little protected 

1181
01:01:42,511 --> 01:01:43,650
area.
So it's like,

1182
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:46,050
it's like the castle that the Buddha 
grows up in.

1183
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:47,783
All the bad things are outside of it.
And the reason for that actually is 

1184
01:01:50,611 --> 01:01:54,690
because of the kingdom is guarded by 
these descendants of great kings.

1185
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:55,553
The striders who the hobbits have some 
contempt for cause they kind of look 

1186
01:01:58,261 --> 01:02:00,180
like tramps.
Aragorn is one of them.

1187
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:05,390
So the descendants of great kings patrol
the borders and keep the naive and habit

1188
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:06,454
and some of the shyer safe.
And there are naive and they go about 

1189
01:02:08,671 --> 01:02:10,570
their day to day work and nothing really
threatened them.

1190
01:02:10,571 --> 01:02:11,404
And there's no monsters around.
And because they don't have any real 

1191
01:02:13,291 --> 01:02:16,980
challenges and because they're peaceful 
in their wealth and security,

1192
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,960
they think they're good,
but they're,

1193
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:22,710
they're just naive and undisciplined and
relatively weak.

1194
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,080
And so they're not prepared for 
anything.

1195
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:27,750
When all hell breaks loose.
They're,

1196
01:02:27,751 --> 01:02:28,650
they're,
they're like,

1197
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,600
they're like,
they're like bait.

1198
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:32,100
They're like prey,
you know.

1199
01:02:32,101 --> 01:02:33,930
So,
and of course the wizard,

1200
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,113
um,
Gandalf knows this now despite the fact 

1201
01:02:38,251 --> 01:02:43,251
that the sugar folk are rather small and
a bit comical and tremendously naive.

1202
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,710
They do have a latent ability for 
courage and,

1203
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:47,603
and,
and forthrightness and Gandalf can 

1204
01:02:49,531 --> 01:02:51,420
really see this in the one hobbit,
Bilbo.

1205
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:56,690
And so he tells Bilbo that darkness is 
brewing on the outs and the,

1206
01:02:57,330 --> 01:03:00,570
in the outlands outside of protected 
territory.

1207
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:03,210
Absolutely classic mythological 
representation.

1208
01:03:03,211 --> 01:03:05,820
It's the same in the lion king where,
um,

1209
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:06,873
um,
Mustafa tells Simba that his kingdom is 

1210
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:12,450
everything that the light falls on and 
that he's not to journey outside of that

1211
01:03:12,451 --> 01:03:13,171
domain.
Right?

1212
01:03:13,171 --> 01:03:15,840
That's how the elephant graveyard in 
death and all of that,

1213
01:03:15,841 --> 01:03:19,170
that's outside of the Shyer,
let's say it's outside of Paradise.

1214
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,003
It's outside of the walled city.
It's outside of your domain of 

1215
01:03:22,501 --> 01:03:24,210
knowledge.
Well,

1216
01:03:24,211 --> 01:03:26,430
that's where,
that's where,

1217
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,660
that's where malevolence and chaos,
bruce.

1218
01:03:30,661 --> 01:03:31,494
Now you see that again in,
in the lion king because that's where 

1219
01:03:33,241 --> 01:03:34,074
scar and the hyenas go off to to 
conspire and turn into what are 

1220
01:03:38,131 --> 01:03:41,420
essentially Jack booted Nazis before 
they take over the,

1221
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,530
the pride land.
Same idea.

1222
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:44,911
Okay,
well,

1223
01:03:44,911 --> 01:03:49,590
so what happens to bill bolt when he 
goes off to confront the dragon?

1224
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:53,340
He has to become a thief,
right?

1225
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,530
Which is very picky.
It's very,

1226
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:57,593
it's very strange ethically because 
while bill bill wasn't a thief and you 

1227
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:00,511
think,
well,

1228
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:03,690
it's better to be,
to not be a thief than to be a thief.

1229
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:07,140
And the answer to that,
it's very hard answer,

1230
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,033
very complicated answer.
And it's not one to be dealt with 

1231
01:04:10,921 --> 01:04:15,921
lightly.
It's not,

1232
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:22,390
it's not good to be moral if the reason 
that your moral is because you cannot be

1233
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:24,910
otherwise.
So that's the naivety issue,

1234
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:26,340
right?
So naive,

1235
01:04:26,341 --> 01:04:27,174
it is not morality.
And if you're terrified to be a thief 

1236
01:04:30,521 --> 01:04:33,910
and you have no skill at it and you're 
not a thief,

1237
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:35,830
that doesn't mean you're good.
Now,

1238
01:04:35,831 --> 01:04:37,690
if you could be the best thief in the 
world,

1239
01:04:37,691 --> 01:04:39,850
man,
you were one sneaky character and,

1240
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:40,773
and,
and fast on your feet and a real 

1241
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:45,520
strategic thinker and capable of 
breaking rules when necessary,

1242
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,673
and scaling walls and climbing houses 
and infiltrating parties and plotting 

1243
01:04:50,291 --> 01:04:53,320
for the long run,
and then you decided not to do it,

1244
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:55,600
well then,
then that's a whole different story.

1245
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,610
Then you're a moral animal,
right?

1246
01:04:57,611 --> 01:05:00,730
So you need that capacity for 
criminality.

1247
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:04,180
You need the capacity for criminality,
you need the capacity of evil,

1248
01:05:04,181 --> 01:05:07,330
and you need to have mastered that.
And that's what makes you good.

1249
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:09,003
And so while that's what happens in the 
harbor is that Bilbo has to develop his 

1250
01:05:11,921 --> 01:05:13,270
dark side,
his shadow,

1251
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,430
and he does that,
you know?

1252
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,330
And,
and,

1253
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:17,163
and,
well,

1254
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,140
he's a thief and a variety of ways.
He ends up stealing the ring,

1255
01:05:20,141 --> 01:05:20,974
which is really interesting.
And of course that that bleeds into the 

1256
01:05:23,831 --> 01:05:25,420
Lord of the rings.
So,

1257
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,254
and,
and,

1258
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:26,991
and,
but the,

1259
01:05:26,991 --> 01:05:27,731
you know,
the look,

1260
01:05:27,731 --> 01:05:29,140
he doesn't get away Scot free

1261
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:30,853
from developing his dark side.
Like he's touched by evil from then on 

1262
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:35,600
and he's got the ring problem and that's
a big one,

1263
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:38,360
that thing that might possess him 
because he's got too close to it.

1264
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,313
It's like Harry Potter partner in his 
scar and the fact that he has a bit of 

1265
01:05:41,711 --> 01:05:42,544
voldemort hit them.
It's exactly the same idea or the 

1266
01:05:44,481 --> 01:05:48,450
strange affinity that the joker insists 
upon in joker and Batman.

1267
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:51,830
MMM MMM.
When,

1268
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:52,783
when bill bill comes back to the Shire,
like he's never one of the hobbits 

1269
01:05:55,491 --> 01:05:57,410
again.
He's always an outsider.

1270
01:05:57,411 --> 01:06:01,670
He's got a glimmer of magic and danger 
about them and that makes people respect

1271
01:06:01,671 --> 01:06:02,504
him.
But they also,

1272
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:07,400
they also think that he's unconventional
in an unacceptable way and you know,

1273
01:06:07,401 --> 01:06:11,750
kind of make a wide berth around him 
because now he's contaminated with,

1274
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:12,953
with evil and the unknown.
Even though that makes them a much 

1275
01:06:14,991 --> 01:06:18,230
better character,
all things considered and a real fighter

1276
01:06:18,231 --> 01:06:19,064
in the battle between good and evil,
and the person who's gone out and 

1277
01:06:21,081 --> 01:06:23,180
confronted the dragon and got the 
treasure,

1278
01:06:23,181 --> 01:06:25,940
all of that.
So well,

1279
01:06:25,941 --> 01:06:26,774
the pathway to,
from naivety to the full development of 

1280
01:06:28,761 --> 01:06:29,594
character is associated with the 
development in the union sense of the 

1281
01:06:33,171 --> 01:06:34,004
shadow.
And that's that capacity for mayhem and 

1282
01:06:35,511 --> 01:06:37,700
malevolence that needs to be brought 
under control.

1283
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,660
So yes,
it's,

1284
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:41,750
it's,
it's,

1285
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:44,310
it's complicated.
Um,

1286
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:45,523
and,
and that doesn't mean that you're 

1287
01:06:47,181 --> 01:06:48,014
justified in going out and breaking 
rules because you think that you're 

1288
01:06:49,911 --> 01:06:51,410
building your character.
You know,

1289
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,350
it's not that simple.
If you look out,

1290
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:54,603
um,

1291
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,220
if you look at stories like Harry 
Potter,

1292
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,590
you know,
all of Harry's crew breaks rules,

1293
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:05,910
but they only break a rule when not 
breaking.

1294
01:07:05,911 --> 01:07:10,140
It would break a higher order rule.
And that's still morally ambivalent,

1295
01:07:10,141 --> 01:07:10,974
right?
Because the best pathway forward is to 

1296
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,113
violate no conventions,
to do the right thing and violate new 

1297
01:07:17,731 --> 01:07:18,750
conventions.
No,

1298
01:07:18,810 --> 01:07:19,643
no conventions.
But now and then you're in a terrible 

1299
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:22,404
situation where you can,
you can do a small bad thing or a large 

1300
01:07:26,581 --> 01:07:31,020
bad thing or you can allow a large,
bad thing to happen by,

1301
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:34,050
by,
by not,

1302
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:35,503
by,
by failing to break a rule that often 

1303
01:07:37,111 --> 01:07:40,140
happens in Harry Potter.
So then you're in trouble.

1304
01:07:40,141 --> 01:07:40,974
And part of being wise and oriented 
towards the good is to know when 

1305
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:46,470
breaking a rule is the right thing to 
do,

1306
01:07:46,471 --> 01:07:48,990
even though you shouldn't break rules.
So

1307
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:51,823
yeah,

1308
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:55,910
Canada has legalized marijuana.
What are your thoughts?

1309
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:01,830
It's about time.
That's my thoughts.

1310
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:06,450
I think that once a certain number of 
people break a law,

1311
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:10,530
then it's not reasonable to have the 
law.

1312
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:12,780
That's part of it.
Um,

1313
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:13,823
it isn't obvious to me that
it was irrational in some sense to have 

1314
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:23,443
for marijuana to be illegal,
especially given that alcohol is legal 

1315
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:28,070
because all calls way more dangerous 
than marijuana.

1316
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,040
I'm more or less libertarian on this 
front.

1317
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:31,903
It's like
smoke your damn part and try not to act 

1318
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:37,190
like too much of a moron when you're 
stoned.

1319
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:39,950
That's what it looks like to me.
So,

1320
01:08:39,951 --> 01:08:40,784
and,
and I kind of feel that way across the 

1321
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:45,050
spectrum of consciousness altering 
substances.

1322
01:08:45,051 --> 01:08:46,710
It's like,
ew,

1323
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:47,783
ew.
I think that the danger of restricting 

1324
01:08:51,111 --> 01:08:51,944
people's freedoms unnecessarily is more 
dangerous than the danger of not 

1325
01:08:56,691 --> 01:08:57,524
restricting them.
And so you're entitled to go to hell in 

1326
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,910
a handbasket in your own manner.

1327
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:04,340
Um,
and hopefully,

1328
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:05,503
but I do think that if you're going to 
engage or indulge in your favorite drug 

1329
01:09:10,161 --> 01:09:10,994
of abuse,
that you should be as little amount of 

1330
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:17,180
annoying to everyone around you as you 
possibly can be.

1331
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,410
Then I would also say with regards to 
drug trade in general,

1332
01:09:21,411 --> 01:09:26,411
is that here's a bunch of consequences 
of the war on drugs.

1333
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:28,850
A lot of the unexpected,
first of all,

1334
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,700
terrible incarceration rates,
especially in the United States,

1335
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:33,043
that's not so good.
Second is the dumping of hundreds of 

1336
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:38,023
millions or billions of dollars into the
hands of like serious criminals and the 

1337
01:09:39,531 --> 01:09:42,680
destabilization of much of Central 
America as a consequence,

1338
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:46,580
tremendous violence as a consequence.
And then the enriching of people who are

1339
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:50,990
these are seriously committed,
dangerous criminals.

1340
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,390
And to give them that much power is a 
bad idea.

1341
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:54,823
So maybe the government has to tax and 
regulate like it does with cigarettes 

1342
01:09:58,221 --> 01:10:00,980
and it does with alcohol and to some 
degree it does with gambling.

1343
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:04,670
Um,
then the next issue is,

1344
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,100
uh,
one of the consequences now of

1345
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:10,040
the,
the,

1346
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:11,173
the

1347
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:12,823
classification of certain drugs as 
illegal is that the chemists are faster 

1348
01:10:17,511 --> 01:10:18,344
than the legislators.
And so what they do is they keep making 

1349
01:10:20,751 --> 01:10:21,584
variants of addictive drugs.
And now instead of a dozen drugs of 

1350
01:10:24,561 --> 01:10:27,020
abuse,
which is what we had say 20 years ago,

1351
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,033
we have like 300,
and some of them are way more addictive 

1352
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,450
than the original drugs.
And so it isn't,

1353
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:40,550
it doesn't look like good policy to me.
And I know that places like Portugal,

1354
01:10:40,551 --> 01:10:41,384
for example,
have decriminalized every drug of abuse 

1355
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:48,110
and it doesn't look like it's been a 
catastrophe.

1356
01:10:48,590 --> 01:10:50,420
So,
well,

1357
01:10:50,421 --> 01:10:51,254
we'll see.
Right?

1358
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:53,780
We legalized marijuana yesterday.
There's no,

1359
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:57,560
the streets aren't full of stone people 
bumping into walls.

1360
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,290
Nothing's changed.
I hope it works.

1361
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:03,680
I hope that the government regulates it 
properly,

1362
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:07,360
that they derive tax revenue from it and
that um,

1363
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:12,460
people use pot a little and that people 
use alcohol a little less.

1364
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:16,110
That would be good because alcohol is a 
very dangerous drug.

1365
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:18,660
So,
okay.

1366
01:11:18,661 --> 01:11:20,790
So I'm going to go for eight more 
minutes.

1367
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:21,624
I have to stop comparatively early today
because I have to pack and then I have 

1368
01:11:25,801 --> 01:11:29,130
to go to Dublin.
And so just to warn you all.

1369
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:30,413
So

1370
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:06,943
do you have any advice on how to vet a 
potential marriage partner during the 

1371
01:12:10,011 --> 01:12:14,420
dating relationship phase?
God,

1372
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:18,710
that's a hard question.
Okay.

1373
01:12:18,711 --> 01:12:23,450
So while I can tell you what I've 
observed as a consequence of watching,

1374
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:24,913
you know,
all the married people successful and 

1375
01:12:26,841 --> 01:12:28,190
unsuccessful,
who I know,

1376
01:12:28,191 --> 01:12:31,640
but also watching all my clients and 
giving this a fair bit of thought.

1377
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:36,490
Um,
here,

1378
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:41,500
here's some of what's necessary for a 
successful marriage.

1379
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:47,673
You have to trust the person.
That doesn't mean they can't make 

1380
01:12:51,611 --> 01:12:53,920
mistakes because you're going to make 
mistakes and so are they.

1381
01:12:53,921 --> 01:12:56,710
But fundamentally you have to trust 
them.

1382
01:12:57,010 --> 01:13:02,010
And what that means is that you have to 
trust that if things go wrong,

1383
01:13:02,561 --> 01:13:03,394
if they make a mistake,
they'll do what was necessary in 

1384
01:13:06,191 --> 01:13:07,024
conjunction with you to set it right.
You have to be able to negotiate with 

1385
01:13:11,381 --> 01:13:13,060
the person.
And those two things are tied very,

1386
01:13:13,061 --> 01:13:15,610
very close together.
So if you,

1387
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,473
you guys have to be able to have a 
conversation about what it is that you 

1388
01:13:20,501 --> 01:13:22,720
want to do,
come to a conclusion,

1389
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:29,490
moderate your differences,
move forward and have that work.

1390
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:33,120
You have to be able to fight and make up
both of those.

1391
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:37,650
If you can't fight with your potential 
marriage partner,

1392
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,113
then you're not communicating because 
there's just no bloody way that you're 

1393
01:13:42,961 --> 01:13:43,794
going to get along.
There's no way you're gonna agree on 

1394
01:13:46,231 --> 01:13:47,760
everything.
That's just not going to happen.

1395
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:53,150
So you have to be honest with one 
another enough to have some conflict.

1396
01:13:54,061 --> 01:13:56,970
But then you have to be able to make up.
That's a huge deal,

1397
01:13:56,971 --> 01:13:58,800
man,
because well,

1398
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:01,170
then you get to have conflict and solve 
problems and make up.

1399
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:05,510
So trust negotiation,
uh,

1400
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:06,623
conflict resolution.
The next thing I would say is it's kind 

1401
01:14:10,351 --> 01:14:12,100
of Nice if you're attracted to each 
other.

1402
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:12,993
You know,
if there's a strong sexual attraction 

1403
01:14:14,501 --> 01:14:15,334
there,
it isn't obvious to me that that's 

1404
01:14:16,931 --> 01:14:19,780
something that can be conjured up if it 
doesn't exist.

1405
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:22,510
I haven't seen that happened 
successfully.

1406
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:23,583
It's,
that seems to depend on factors that 

1407
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,680
aren't really under voluntary control.
You know,

1408
01:14:29,681 --> 01:14:30,514
I mean obviously people can modify 
themselves to some degree to be more or 

1409
01:14:33,041 --> 01:14:35,930
less attractive,
staying in physical shape and,

1410
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:37,570
and,
and that sort of thing.

1411
01:14:37,571 --> 01:14:39,160
Dressing nicely and,
and,

1412
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:40,053
and having a certain amount of sex 
appeal and charisma and provocativeness 

1413
01:14:44,591 --> 01:14:46,240
that's all there.
But that's,

1414
01:14:46,241 --> 01:14:47,980
that's all well and good and it's 
important.

1415
01:14:47,981 --> 01:14:48,814
But I do believe that that spark that's 
outside of voluntary control is a 

1416
01:14:52,901 --> 01:14:55,810
necessary precondition for a long 
lasting relationship.

1417
01:14:56,170 --> 01:14:57,003
I do believe though that if it's there,
you still have to work very hard to 

1418
01:15:00,971 --> 01:15:01,804
maintain it as hard in your marriage as 
you would when you're dating and you 

1419
01:15:04,661 --> 01:15:06,100
need to know that.
Um,

1420
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:10,570
then it's also helpful if you actually 
like the person,

1421
01:15:10,571 --> 01:15:12,700
you know,
if they're your friend that you actually

1422
01:15:12,701 --> 01:15:14,230
liked to go do things with them.

1423
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,690
Sort of independent of the romantic 
element,

1424
01:15:16,691 --> 01:15:17,524
you know,
if there,

1425
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,740
you don't need to want to do everything 
together,

1426
01:15:20,741 --> 01:15:24,460
but you should have some things that you
like to do in common.

1427
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:27,520
So some similarity in personality is 
useful.

1428
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:30,400
The personality scale is useful for 
that.

1429
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:31,234
Like look here,
here it's really hard for an extreme 

1430
01:15:33,761 --> 01:15:34,594
extrovert and an extreme introvert to 
live together because the extreme 

1431
01:15:37,661 --> 01:15:38,494
extrovert wants to meet with people all 
the time and the extreme introvert is 

1432
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,633
immediately exhausted by that and it's,
neither of those things are precisely 

1433
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:50,380
under voluntary control.
Um,

1434
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:51,603
it's really hard for someone super 
agreeable and super disagreeable to get 

1435
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:55,683
along together because the agreeable 
person isn't going to be able to stand 

1436
01:15:59,711 --> 01:16:00,544
up very well to the disagreeable person 
and the disagreeable person is going to 

1437
01:16:03,101 --> 01:16:06,160
think that the agreeable person is a 
pushover.

1438
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,230
That's rough.
I,

1439
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:09,173
it's very hard for someone high in 
openness and someone very low and 

1440
01:16:11,411 --> 01:16:12,244
openness to be together because they 
open person is like fascinated by ideas 

1441
01:16:14,981 --> 01:16:15,814
and really interested in this theoretics
and art and philosophy and poetry and 

1442
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:18,640
all of that.

1443
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,240
And the person who's low in openness,
it's like they're colorblind to that.

1444
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:27,450
It's not in their realm of involuntary 
interest.

1445
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:30,850
Conscientiousness,
the same thing.

1446
01:16:30,851 --> 01:16:33,670
If if you,
if you're a very conscientious person,

1447
01:16:33,671 --> 01:16:36,190
very diligent nose to the grindstone,
um,

1448
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:37,563
industrious and orderly and your partner
can while away at the time with no 

1449
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:45,910
problem whatsoever and doesn't mind a 
mass in disorder,

1450
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:46,893
then that's the,
the conscientious person is going to 

1451
01:16:50,081 --> 01:16:50,914
think that the unconscientious person is
useless and the unconscientious person 

1452
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,900
is going to think that the conscientious
person is an uptight tyrant.

1453
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:02,020
And that's very,
very hard to overcome.

1454
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:03,850
It's,
it's like a fatal flaw.

1455
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,480
So those extreme personality differences
across more than one or two traits is,

1456
01:17:08,481 --> 01:17:11,300
is going to make your relationship 
extraordinarily difficult.

1457
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:15,500
So the only place where that might be 
different is that,

1458
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:16,843
you know,
you probably don't want to both be high 

1459
01:17:19,191 --> 01:17:20,150
in neuroticism.

1460
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,290
So like if one of you is high in 
neuroticism and the other isn't,

1461
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:25,273
that's kind of a nice balance because 
one of you will be a little alert to 

1462
01:17:29,571 --> 01:17:33,080
threat and the other one will come.
The one who is alert to threat down.

1463
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,033
If you're both low in neuroticism,
well then that's not going to be too 

1464
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:36,884
much of a problem.
Although you might be a little bit less 

1465
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:40,034
risk averse than you should be.
But mostly you want a fair bit of 

1466
01:17:42,621 --> 01:17:43,454
similarity in terms of personality.
Then I guess the other thing is is that 

1467
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:50,330
well do you have something like a shared
vision of the future?

1468
01:17:50,331 --> 01:17:51,164
You know,
like how are you going to mediate the 

1469
01:17:55,910 --> 01:18:00,410
Chi inevitable conflict between whose 
career takes priority and,

1470
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:03,530
and what about kids?
Do you both want kids?

1471
01:18:03,531 --> 01:18:04,364
And if you do want kids,
when do you want them and how many do 

1472
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:10,400
you want and what's your sense about 
who's responsible for what,

1473
01:18:10,401 --> 01:18:13,430
when with regards to the kids and the 
same when you're running a household,

1474
01:18:13,431 --> 01:18:15,350
it's like,
do you have some sense of,

1475
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:16,813
do you have enough shared beliefs?
So that running a household together is 

1476
01:18:19,971 --> 01:18:20,804
something that is with a peaceful 
household and a productive household is 

1477
01:18:24,141 --> 01:18:29,060
within the realm of possibility.
So I'm [inaudible] that's,

1478
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:31,070
that's,
that's what it looks like to me.

1479
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:32,233
So.

1480
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:33,123
MMM.

1481
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:36,020
That's a lot of things.
So

1482
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:42,350
you said you act as if God exists.
Do you also act as if the devil exists?

1483
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:43,243
Man,
I think I probably act even more as if 

1484
01:18:44,781 --> 01:18:47,360
the devil exists because it's a lot.
In some sense.

1485
01:18:47,361 --> 01:18:50,810
It's a lot more easy for me.
And I think it is for most people.

1486
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:52,580
I'm,
it's easy.

1487
01:18:52,581 --> 01:18:53,414
It's easier for me to believe in the 
reality of malevolence and evil and to 

1488
01:18:57,201 --> 01:18:58,034
be terrified about that getting a grip 
on me than it is to be optimistic and 

1489
01:19:03,201 --> 01:19:06,320
naive about the possibility of 
transcendent good.

1490
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:08,130
Like it,
it's just that,

1491
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:12,740
it's not that I am skeptical about the 
reality of transcendent good.

1492
01:19:12,741 --> 01:19:13,574
I mean,
fundamentally I believe that good is 

1493
01:19:16,311 --> 01:19:18,410
more powerful than evil.
I do believe that.

1494
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:22,010
But there's something palpable about 
evil that is,

1495
01:19:22,011 --> 01:19:24,320
and it's also undeniable.
It's like,

1496
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:25,423
well,
you can debate about whether or not 

1497
01:19:26,151 --> 01:19:27,680
heaven exists,
you know,

1498
01:19:27,681 --> 01:19:28,514
and you can even be skeptical,
but you can't debate about whether the 

1499
01:19:30,651 --> 01:19:32,090
Gulag archipelago exists.

1500
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:36,440
And you can't debate about Auschwitz.
And you can't debate about the fact that

1501
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:37,693
people's proclivity towards blindness 
and malevolence produced those horrors 

1502
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,433
and the horrors that people often 
encounter in their day to day world and 

1503
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:49,070
in their relationships.
So it's very easy for someone like me to

1504
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:53,360
be a believer in evil and to try to turn
away from that.

1505
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:57,860
And so and but,
but through deep contemplation,

1506
01:19:57,890 --> 01:19:58,723
you know,
I've come to the conclusion that the 

1507
01:20:01,161 --> 01:20:01,994
ability of human beings to turn away 
from evil and to pursue good is more 

1508
01:20:06,591 --> 01:20:09,630
powerful malevolence itself.
But that's more of,

1509
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:11,100
it's funny.
That's more of a,

1510
01:20:12,610 --> 01:20:16,120
that fills me with,
with hope and,

1511
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:17,643
and and awe I guess is the right word 
when I can bring it to mind and think 

1512
01:20:23,891 --> 01:20:28,891
that we can in fact defeat malevolence 
but sort of on a moment to moment basis,

1513
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:36,390
the malevolence is so palpable and so 
real that it's a more powerful,

1514
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,200
it's a more powerful motivator for,
for avoidance.

1515
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,240
I don't mean avoidance of 
responsibility,

1516
01:20:47,241 --> 01:20:49,760
I mean avoidance of walking down that 
path.

1517
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:52,310
And I think that's probably again 
keeping with the cycle,

1518
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:53,173
well known psychological doctrine that 
people are more loss averse than they 

1519
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:58,040
are gained sensitive,
you know,

1520
01:20:58,041 --> 01:20:58,874
so a loss of x,
it upsets you more to lose $5 then it 

1521
01:21:03,771 --> 01:21:06,880
does make you happy to gain $5.
That's,

1522
01:21:06,910 --> 01:21:11,910
that's a well known psychological fact.
And it's because we're more sensitive to

1523
01:21:12,501 --> 01:21:13,334
punishment and negative emotion.
And that's because while you can die in 

1524
01:21:16,701 --> 01:21:18,950
agony,
but you can only be so happy.

1525
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:24,430
So yes,
I certainly act as if the devil exists,

1526
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:25,333
I would say,
and I think I probably believed in the 

1527
01:21:27,501 --> 01:21:29,090
devil,
so to speak,

1528
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:32,720
speaking metaphorically,
before I believed in God,

1529
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:33,793
speaking metaphorically,
I became convinced of the reality of 

1530
01:21:36,471 --> 01:21:40,310
evil and that really,
and not only that,

1531
01:21:40,311 --> 01:21:42,650
not only convinced of the reality of 
evil,

1532
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:43,723
but also convinced that everyone was 
destined to play their part in that 

1533
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:48,703
including me,
and that it would be better if I played 

1534
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:52,790
the least part in that as possible.

1535
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:53,833
You know?
And that sort of brings us back to this 

1536
01:21:55,131 --> 01:21:55,731
book.
You know,

1537
01:21:55,731 --> 01:21:56,564
a soldier knits and said the line that 
divides good from evil runs down the 

1538
01:22:02,871 --> 01:22:05,930
heart of every individual,
right?

1539
01:22:05,931 --> 01:22:07,880
It's an internal thing.
Nada.

1540
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:10,730
It's not between states,
it's not between groups.

1541
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:12,283
It's between elements of our psyche and 
our individual responsibility is to 

1542
01:22:17,330 --> 01:22:21,140
work,
to ameliorate suffering and to constrain

1543
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:26,170
malevolence and to start with ourselves.
And so that's a good place to end.

1544
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:32,900
So thank you all very much for your 
continued support,

1545
01:22:32,901 --> 01:22:33,734
for paying attention to this q and a for
everything that you've offered to me 

1546
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:40,573
over the last few years.
It's been an absolutely overwhelming 

1547
01:22:43,641 --> 01:22:44,810
experience,
for example,

1548
01:22:44,811 --> 01:22:45,644
to go out and do these lectures.
They're unbelievably positive 

1549
01:22:47,931 --> 01:22:48,764
experiences.
To See all these thousands of people 

1550
01:22:50,331 --> 01:22:55,331
come out to engage in a serious 
discussion about vision and strategy and

1551
01:22:55,971 --> 01:23:00,971
responsibility and individual 
sovereignty and the,

1552
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:03,313
the possibility that we could all aim 
together acting individually towards at 

1553
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,500
least a less hellish future.
That's really something.

1554
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:16,330
So,
um,

1555
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:21,610
that's good guys.
So

1556
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:26,040
till next time,
till November,

1557
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:29,400
and I'll put out this video on the 
soldier knits and preface,

1558
01:23:29,401 --> 01:23:30,234
I'll put that out before November 1st.
That'll probably be next on the next on 

1559
01:23:35,581 --> 01:23:38,580
the list.
And so it's off to Europe and,

1560
01:23:38,610 --> 01:23:40,890
uh,
we'll talk to you all soon.

1561
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:42,570
Thanks very much.

1562
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:46,150
Bye for now.
