1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,950
I'm actually supposed to be talking to 
you

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,120
about constructivism today,
but I'm not going to continue to talking

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:08,963
to you about what I was talking last 
time and I'll collapse the 

4
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:14,820
constructivism lectures into one lecture
so it'll keep us on track.

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,403
I want to tell you a little bit about a 
little bit more about this image and 

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,940
what it probably means and then then 
we're good.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,953
We're going to continue with our 
discussion of shamanic transformation 

8
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,020
and its relationship with personality 
transformation.

9
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:34,050
So the first thing,
if you look at the picture on the right,

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,993
the first thing you'll see of course is 
that it's a tree and the tree is 

11
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:38,934
associated with snake.
Now I believe I told you guys about 

12
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:42,234
Linnaeus bells research and the 
relationship between predatory state 

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,100
prevalence,
acuity of human vision,

14
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,450
that you remember that.
Okay,

15
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:49,700
that's good.
So,

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,210
so to me what the image on the right 
looks like is,

17
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:55,044
first of all it's like the ancestral 
home of human beings for tens of 

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,710
millions of years or our that's tree 
with the snake,

19
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,550
with the primary human environment maybe
60 million years ago.

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,810
It's not human at that level,
but it's,

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,730
it's,
it's,

22
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,410
it's part of our evolutionary heritage.
And then it's also part of why we have a

23
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:14,244
sense,
especially that large trees are sort of 

24
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:18,270
statement that's one of the senses that 
drives environmentalism,

25
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:20,550
for example,
because environmentalists are often very

26
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,220
interested in protecting old growth 
forests,

27
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:24,054
which is actually kind of weird because 
old growth forests are ready to burn 

28
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:27,990
down and they're also kind of 
biologically dead.

29
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,080
There's no light can get to the bottom 
and nothing grows down there.

30
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:33,360
So they're just trees and they're almost
dead treatment.

31
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,853
So,
you know,

32
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,260
from,
uh,

33
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,093
from uh,
from the perspective of biological 

34
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:38,334
diversity,
they're not wearing that and 

35
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,763
environment,
but human beings still have some real 

36
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:44,790
kinship with those gigantic trees.
And we feel that there's something,

37
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,520
you know,
natural sacred.

38
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,723
So superimposed on that is I think 
something like the next stage of human 

39
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:52,510
evolution.

40
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,610
And so,
you know,

41
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,483
these,
these representations were made by 

42
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:58,020
people who are trying to represent the 
sort of,

43
00:01:58,021 --> 00:02:02,640
the ultimate reality of mankind.
And so super imposed on the tree is a is

44
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:06,090
a mile and a mountain is a nice 
representation of a pyramid.

45
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:08,910
And The pyramid is a nice representation
of a dominance hierarchy.

46
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,013
Of course,
I already mentioned to you that human 

47
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:13,410
beings live in Darwin.
It's hard because in that there are very

48
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:14,244
permanent part of our environment being 
at least 300 million years old and 

49
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,100
possibly older than that.
So when,

50
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,963
when the human imagination is trying to 
conceptualize what constitutes ultimate 

51
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:25,164
reality,
that's a reality that's often beyond 

52
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:27,864
what you could merely see because the 
things you see that are directly in 

53
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:31,404
front of you are not necessarily the 
most real things in that many of the 

54
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:37,380
things that you see are transforming 
fairly rapidly.

55
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,130
They're not permanent in any real sense.
I mean automobiles to see all the time,

56
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:42,750
but they've only been around for 80 
years.

57
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:45,330
You know,
it's not like we've adapted biologically

58
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,840
to their presidents.
So you have a mountain in the middle and

59
00:02:48,841 --> 00:02:52,330
the mountain is sort of sitting in a 
circumscribed territory.

60
00:02:52,331 --> 00:02:53,164
And the idea there is that there's a 
dominance hierarchy that human beings 

61
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,980
inhabit and it always occupies a 
particular.

62
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,870
And the dominance hierarchy is like the 
culture,

63
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,290
the place of culture that mankind exists
within,

64
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,333
that surrounded by the chaos outside and
the chaos outside is represented by the 

65
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,120
two snakes and be in the picture on,
on your,

66
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,510
in the snake in the middle isn't zero 
growth,

67
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:20,344
it's a snake that eats its own tail and 
it's representative of the chaos that's 

68
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:26,620
outside of the familiarity of your 
culture.

69
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,390
And so that's,
it's a very,

70
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,313
as we've mentioned already,
it's a very intelligent perspective 

71
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:32,810
because it says,
well man,

72
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,460
I'm kind always lives in culture and 
surrounding culture is the unknown,

73
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,330
and that's the internal habitat of,
of man.

74
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,370
So human beings.
So,

75
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,363
and then I showed you this picture 
briefly and that's the picture that was 

76
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:47,644
derived by a German researcher who was 
examining the visions of the Peruvian 

77
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,141
Amazonian Indians,
the Shaman.

78
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:58,141
And you can see it's almost staggeringly
same perspective right down to the snake

79
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:00,484
that eats its own tail,
which by the way is an extremely common 

80
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,200
ancient symbol.
So it's quite remarkable.

81
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,750
Um,
now what might unite,

82
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,570
and then I talked to you about my,
my son's drawing.

83
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,060
I haven't given to get to this one 
though,

84
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:17,050
or what might unite these different 
visions say that Scandinavia division in

85
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:17,884
the Amazonian romantic vision are the 
methods that the people who had 

86
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,563
divisions use to induce them.
I'll talk to you a little bit about 

87
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:25,870
that,
but first of all,

88
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:28,120
I'm going to tell you about this picture
because I think this is one,

89
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,660
a couple of variations of this picture 
that I found.

90
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,880
I actually don't know his name,
but I think it's one of the most amazing

91
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:34,714
images I've ever come across because in 
some ways sums up Christianity in one 

92
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,330
picture.
And that's no easy thing to do.

93
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:42,460
And the reason I think it's important 
to,

94
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,773
uh,
to,

95
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,120
to talk about the Christian 
representation,

96
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:46,954
for example,
that we've already talked about some 

97
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:48,754
Dallas representations is because if in 
so far as we're embedded in western 

98
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,800
civilization,
the roots of Western civilization are,

99
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,220
they pushed themselves down into 
Christianity and then deeper,

100
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:01,054
there's deeper substrata under that.
The religious structures that preceded 

101
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,074
Christianity.
But if you want to understand the 

102
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,730
western notions of the person and the 
ideal person as well,

103
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:16,450
you have to look at the structure of the
systems that Western civilization,

104
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,280
Rhoda,
because the religious systems,

105
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:19,114
for example,
or the systems in which the idea of the 

106
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:23,930
ideal emerged and so you.

107
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,510
You can't come to grips with the idea of
the ideal or the idea of mental health,

108
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:29,344
which is which is an ideal without 
understanding the ground out of which 

109
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:32,854
these ideas emerged.
You can't come to terms with it many 

110
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,450
fundamental sense.
And the thing is,

111
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:40,210
if you're doing clinical psychology,
for example,

112
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:41,044
you have to come to terms with it in a 
fundamental sense because a lot of the 

113
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:43,864
time when people come and see you,
the reason they come and see you is 

114
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:46,924
because their sense of life's meaning 
has been shattered and and they're 

115
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,580
unable to proceed without the 
restoration of that meeting.

116
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:55,414
So maybe their belief systems fell apart
and they faced some sort of tragedy 

117
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:58,724
that's just blowing them into pieces and
they have no idea how to orient 

118
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:01,994
themselves.
Because life always presents us an 

119
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:06,800
existential question.
And one that will deal with later,

120
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:07,634
which is life is difficult because it's 
characterized by suffering and because 

121
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:14,550
of that there has to be a reason to 
stand up against them.

122
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,790
And so the reason has to be made 
coherence,

123
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:20,240
so you have to know in some sense,
but you're the sort of creature that can

124
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,410
voluntarily face the tragic conditions 
of existence and prevail.

125
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,420
And that's a religious presuppositions 
fundamentally because it's based on,

126
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,720
it's a hypothesis in some sense that 
human beings are like that.

127
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,290
So let me tell you about this image is.
It's staggering images.

128
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,960
So brilliant.
So the first thing you'll notice is that

129
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,853
of course there's a tree in the middle 
of it and sort of looks like the tree 

130
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:42,940
that you know,
little kid withdraw,

131
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,680
they sort of looked like lollipops or 
something like that.

132
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:47,900
So it's a scheme of history.
We'll see of course,

133
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:49,670
that the snake is wrapped around the 
tree.

134
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,030
The snake and the trees come along 
together unbelievably often.

135
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:55,760
So asclepius his rod.
For example,

136
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,530
Asclepius is the Greek God of Haley.

137
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,260
And you see the symbol of the Greek God 
of healing,

138
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,123
which is that Asclepius,
his rod are all steel used to represent 

139
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:05,594
physicians and it's a rug with a snake 
wrapped around the two and the state 

140
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,210
represents transformation because it can
die,

141
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,730
it can shed its skin,
sort of be reborn and and for many other

142
00:07:13,731 --> 00:07:16,670
reasons besides,
but in this representation,

143
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:20,900
which is partly derived for genesis and 
then partly derived from the development

144
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:23,930
of Christian ideas for thousands of 
years after that,

145
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,813
there's a particular idea that's being 
portrayed now you don't want to set up 

146
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:30,920
in the tree.
There are little things that looked like

147
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:34,850
fruit and one of those things is a skull
right now.

148
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:35,684
So the idea there is that the fruit that
the tree produced is in somehow is in 

149
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,090
some manner equivalent to death.
Now in the,

150
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,063
in the genesis story,
what happens is that eve tempts Adam 

151
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:48,770
with the fruit from the tree,
so she offers him this fruit.

152
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:53,720
Now that's a very interesting thing 
because women historically speaking,

153
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:56,390
have been gathered like men do the 
hunting,

154
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:57,224
generally speaking in archaic societies 
and women do the gathering and human 

155
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:05,540
beings have also a subsistent for large 
parts of their evolutionary history.

156
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:10,400
Before we were human beings,
as we ate fruit and are we the reason we

157
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:11,234
have color vision by the way is so that 
we can detect right fruit and right 

158
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,150
fruit is also tightly associated with 
sexuality.

159
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,520
So like if you look through the ads that
women's magazines,

160
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:24,410
the makeup adds the associations between
ripeness of fruit and say women's cheeks

161
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:27,740
and women's lips are always very much.
They're much put forward,

162
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,820
you know,
and,

163
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,820
and so there's a tight association 
between sexuality and food for a variety

164
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:35,064
of reasons.
But so eve basically tamps Adam in some 

165
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:39,164
sense,
into a conscious relationship with her 

166
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:41,720
by offering him food.

167
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,660
And in the case of the genesis story,
it's rich ripe fruit.

168
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:49,700
And so that's an enticement and she also
entices him into self consciousness,

169
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:51,590
which is quite interesting because 
number one,

170
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,570
women do make men self conscious.
I mean,

171
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,720
that's like that's the ultimate truth of
the,

172
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,833
of the nature of the relationship 
between men and women and rejection in 

173
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:01,674
particular is something that makes men 
self conscious and they're much more 

174
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,653
what exposed to that that women are in 
this sort of sexual dance because women 

175
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:09,864
are sort of on average,
quite quite successful at seeking out 

176
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:17,340
sexual encounters where men are on 
average,

177
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:19,620
very unsuccessful at doing the same 
thing,

178
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,603
so they suffer a lot of rejection.
It's a very fundamental form of 

179
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:23,641
rejection,
right?

180
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:24,391
It's like,
well,

181
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:24,930
you're.
You know,

182
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,380
you're good enough to tolerate being 
alive and all that,

183
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:32,220
but your genetic material shipped by no 
means be allowed to move itself into the

184
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:32,910
future.

185
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,420
It's a really fundamental form of 
rejection and rejection is,

186
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:37,254
well you don't measure up and that's 
certainly the ground of self 

187
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,194
consciousness and so there's a lot of 
weird things tangled up together in 

188
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,433
genesis story.
So even gives Adam the fruit and what 

189
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,260
happens is that wakes them up with the 
stories is,

190
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:53,220
is that the scales fall from his eyes 
and then the first thing that happens is

191
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:54,054
he realizes he's naked.
And that's a very interesting kind of 

192
00:09:56,191 --> 00:09:57,024
realization because to be one of the 
very common nightmares that people have 

193
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:02,610
is that they're naked in front of a 
trout.

194
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,661
So you might say,
well,

195
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:05,580
what does it mean to be naked in front 
of a crop?

196
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,833
Well,
it means to have your vulnerability 

197
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,610
exposed to the arbitrary judgment of,
of the cultural mass.

198
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,870
You know,
it's a nightmare for most people.

199
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:16,704
And human beings are very weird animals 
because most animals wander around on 

200
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:20,370
four legs.

201
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,510
And of course that means the armored 
part of their body is what shows right?

202
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:26,520
Their spine and their ribs along the 
back,

203
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:30,240
which is pretty tough and hard,
but human beings are standing up.

204
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,800
So the most vulnerable parts of our body
or broadcast straight forward.

205
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,083
So and so.
When human beings woke up during our 

206
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:43,560
evolutionary progress towards the kind 
of consciousness we have,

207
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,753
when we became self conscious,
that was essentially equivalent to 

208
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:48,024
recognizing our naked vulnerability and 
that's what the genesis story is trying 

209
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,734
to relate.
When it also points out that it says 

210
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:55,974
snakes,
women and fruit played an integral role 

211
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,630
in the development of human self 
consciousness.

212
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,823
And so here the fruit.
That's the equivalent to death and 

213
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:06,294
that's why there's this in the tree.
And so because what happened was when 

214
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,380
people became self conscious,
like consciously self conscious,

215
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,740
we,
we started to understand the full nature

216
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:17,850
of our vulnerability.

217
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,950
And so what does that mean?
Well,

218
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:23,420
for human beings and in part it meant 
that we discovered time like,

219
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,753
and that's a great thing to discover 
because then it means you have the 

220
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:27,414
future to think about,
but it's also an absolute bloody 

221
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:30,684
catastrophe because you also understand 
that the future is finite and that your 

222
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:38,700
life is bounded and that you will end.
And as far as we know,

223
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:41,940
human beings are the only creatures that
have to contend with that knowledge.

224
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:44,910
And once you have it,
like once you wake up like that,

225
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:45,923
there's no going back to sleep like it's
a qualitative transformation in the 

226
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:51,330
nature of experience.
And you know,

227
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:53,980
the genesis story pushes the idea 
farther.

228
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:54,814
It says,
the fact that we've woken up when 

229
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:01,390
they're are aware of our vulnerability 
is also what makes us fallen creatures.

230
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,380
It makes us alienated from existence in 
a way that animals aren't.

231
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,470
And so what that also means that this is
sort of an existential idea,

232
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:12,130
is that the rise of self consciousness 
in that manner,

233
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,000
which is in part the knowledge of death 
is also what's made people,

234
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,420
um,
well,

235
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,710
one of the things that happens,
for example in genesis,

236
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,993
it's quite a funny story.
So he makes Adam a self conscious and 

237
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:26,860
then they wander off and cover 
themselves up,

238
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:30,770
right?
Which is sort of the first entry into of

239
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,460
cultural artifacts into the paradisical 
state.

240
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,810
That's right.
The first thing you do,

241
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:37,060
once you realize you're naked,
covered yourself up.

242
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,043
Now you know,
that story is often interpreted in a 

243
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:41,530
sexual way.
And there's elements of that,

244
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:43,300
but it's more,
it's more pragmatic.

245
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:44,260
It's like,
yeah,

246
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,153
once you figure out that you're naked 
and you're going to freeze to death and 

247
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:48,034
then it's cold in the future,
it's like the first thing you do do is 

248
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:50,650
cover yourself up.

249
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,733
You know,
when people have been wearing clothes 

250
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,500
for a very long time,
we've been wearing clothes for so long.

251
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:57,334
The body lights are adapted to clothing 
and so it's been tens of thousands of 

252
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,890
years.
So you know,

253
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:05,860
and obviously human beings are also the 
only creatures that were closed,

254
00:13:05,861 --> 00:13:06,491
which is,
you know,

255
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:07,324
and it's a human universal by the way.
People were clothes everywhere that 

256
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,250
virtually everywhere that human beings 
have been discovered.

257
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,713
So you cover yourself up and that's the 
first indication that you're aware of 

258
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:17,374
your vulnerability,
but you're also aware of the necessity 

259
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:22,360
of taking care of yourself as a,
you know,

260
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:23,770
as a separate entity,
which,

261
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,753
which animals.
Animals don't really seem to have that 

262
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:26,621
notion.
I mean,

263
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:30,520
they get hungry and all of that,
but it's not obvious that they know that

264
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:34,060
they can extend the idea of hunger into 
the future so that you know,

265
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,470
so,
so that they're,

266
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,590
they're caring about times that are not 
here yet.

267
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:39,903
Now what happens after people become 
self conscious to cover themselves up 

268
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:46,130
and then God comes into the garden,
which he's always doing.

269
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,970
You have a walk with Adam and Adam can 
be found.

270
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:50,110
And so God says,
you know,

271
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:50,944
well,
you know,

272
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,870
where are you?
What are you doing?

273
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,750
Hiding away in Adam's cowering behind a 
bush,

274
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,340
which is really stupid.
These,

275
00:13:57,341 --> 00:13:58,710
there with eve,
you know,

276
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,910
thinking,
I suppose that God can't see through the

277
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:02,810
Bush or whatever it is that he's 
thinking,

278
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,893
you know,
he makes a case that God asks him what 

279
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,480
in the world he's doing hiding.
And he says,

280
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:08,350
well,
I make it.

281
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,390
And God says,
well,

282
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,860
you know,
how'd you figure that out?

283
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:15,320
And of course Adam being heroic figure 
he is if point Steve and says,

284
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,800
well,
it was the woman's fault for me,

285
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,630
but you know,
it was her that tempted me.

286
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,880
So it's really quite a comical story.
It's,

287
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:27,060
it's often being red being read by sort 
of Patriarchal Christian interpreters as

288
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,560
a story that implicates implicates eve 
in the initial destruction of mankind.

289
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:34,690
But from,
for my way of reading it,

290
00:14:34,691 --> 00:14:35,524
it's just as hard on added,
were even worse because he's such a 

291
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:39,880
cringing powered when things really 
start to go wrong.

292
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:43,000
I mean the first thing he does is hide 
because he's naked.

293
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,700
And the second thing he does,
as soon as these pushed on it a bit,

294
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:47,020
it's like,
it's your fault.

295
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:47,880
It's your fault.
You know,

296
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,723
we won't take responsibility for it.
And that's also an extremely complex 

297
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:54,920
story because one of the things that 
implies it's brilliant,

298
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,813
brilliant idea is that like,
if you can imagine metaphorically that 

299
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:01,860
walking with God means something like,
you know,

300
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,180
uh,
staying in close contact with the divine

301
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:07,100
nature of being or something like that.

302
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,250
And having ultimate faith in the 
positive nature of reality.

303
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:12,840
Things that might damage.
If you became self conscious,

304
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,710
what,
why would you stop believing in that?

305
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,590
Which would be to stop walking with God.
And the answer to that is,

306
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:19,424
well,
you become aware of your own 

307
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,380
vulnerability and your own finiteness 
and that makes you afraid,

308
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,360
so you'll hide.
And that is what people do.

309
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,930
They do that all the time.
It's,

310
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,870
it's a chronic state of human existence 
that in many ways you hide from the best

311
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:33,704
parts of yourself.
But I mean adolescence is usually like 

312
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,250
the painful acting out of that process 
over a protracted period of time.

313
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:42,320
And people often never really recovered 
from that.

314
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,573
They won't bring their best forward 
because they're afraid and they're 

315
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:49,970
afraid for good reason.
And so God says,

316
00:15:49,971 --> 00:15:50,990
Oh,
well now you've done it.

317
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,370
You know,
we can't undo this.

318
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,203
And so now out you go,
you're not going to be in paradise 

319
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,630
anymore,
which means you're no longer going to be

320
00:15:56,631 --> 00:16:00,200
unconscious like a happy child.
It's like you've screwed up completely.

321
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:04,010
You know your finite.
Now you're going to have to work because

322
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,293
you're aware of the future.
And so you know all these things that 

323
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:07,904
can go wrong,
so you're going to have to work because 

324
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,900
you realize that the future could be 
dangerous.

325
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,753
You have to fix things up and he tells 
the women that they're going to suffer 

326
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:15,824
dreadfully in childbirth very well.
It's very interesting because there's a 

327
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,144
reason that women suffered childbirth 
and the reason for that is that your 

328
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,560
child's heads are too big activity both 
about that.

329
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:26,150
The last time we met,
you know,

330
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:26,984
and so the story there also associates 
cortical expansion with self 

331
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,480
consciousness and with the difficulty of
birth.

332
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,323
It's bloody brilliant story.
It's just unbelievable how much 

333
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,970
information is packed into it and then 
that's,

334
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:42,200
that's very characteristic of archetypal
stories that also helps you see how the,

335
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,183
you know,
another manifestation of the kind of 

336
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,254
tree symbolism,
say that's characteristic of the 

337
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:51,731
Scandinavian stories and approving an 
Amazonian and stories and enroll snake.

338
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,150
No trees without snakes,
no paradise snakes,

339
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,283
no ability of mankind to ever produce a 
bounded environment that's safe without 

340
00:17:01,611 --> 00:17:04,010
something chaotic managing to come 
inside of it.

341
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:04,844
There's no way you can do it.
It's a very paradoxical element of 

342
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:09,560
existence.
So that's pretty.

343
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,410
That's pretty interesting.
So that's what's happening with teeth.

344
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,420
On the right side of the picture,
you see this skeleton at the back there.

345
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:20,210
Representing depth,
so that's good.

346
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:24,980
We'll leave and then on the on the left 
side here you have the embodiment of the

347
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:27,080
church and the Christian tradition.

348
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,123
Now she's also handing out things that 
are from the tree and so this is like 

349
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,410
that.
The,

350
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:36,440
the religious stories in general are 
stories about tragedy and redemption.

351
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,390
That's sort of what makes them religious
stories.

352
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,224
It's like the outline,
the terrible things that can happen to 

353
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,640
you,
like in the most brutal possible way.

354
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,653
And then they provide a theory about a 
mode of being that might help you 

355
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:49,590
address stuff.
So that's the redemptive part.

356
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,660
And so the redacted part here is you see
in the tree there's also a crucifix.

357
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,620
It's sort of a counterpart to this call 
and getting the tree.

358
00:17:58,770 --> 00:17:59,603
They're all these little fruits and some
of them are obviously the apple skulls 

359
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:06,210
that eve are handing out,
but what they are on the left hand side,

360
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:07,044
our hosts and the host is the little 
thing that the Catholics eat during the 

361
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:14,550
mass and the host is hypothetically part
of Christ's body.

362
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,090
And so that's what's.
It's a derivative of the last supper.

363
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:18,924
And so there's an unbelievably archaic 
idea that lurks underneath that because 

364
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:23,784
it's basically basically a cannibalistic
ritual and the idea is essentially that 

365
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,420
if you can identify something that's an 
ideal and you can incorporate it and you

366
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:34,254
do that most basically by eating because
that's how you incorporate most 

367
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:39,330
basically,
then that can become part of you.

368
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,960
So you can take on the attributes of 
something by incorporating it.

369
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,063
And so part of the Christian drama is an
attempt to inculcate in its followers 

370
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:51,300
the idea that you should imitate the 
ultimate ideal.

371
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,350
The question is,
well,

372
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:55,680
what's the ultimate ideal in different 
religions handle that in different ways.

373
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:56,790
So food,
if for example,

374
00:18:56,791 --> 00:19:00,780
is an ultimate ideal for Buddhists,
Christ isn't ultimate for Christians.

375
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,823
So then you might say,
well what exactly is this thing that's 

376
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:05,634
ideal?

377
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,410
Okay,
so the host is part of it.

378
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:11,820
So partly it's the body of Christ and 
partly it's a wheaton wafer.

379
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,983
And the reason it's made out of wheat,
just because we was regarded as a dying 

380
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,110
and resurrecting crop,
because it's a,

381
00:19:18,111 --> 00:19:20,860
it's a,
it's a crop that you know,

382
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,343
disappears in the fall and then comes 
back in the spring like most 

383
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:27,120
agricultural products too,
so it's kind of an eternal miracle.

384
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,720
So it's like the dying and resurrected 
corn God.

385
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,793
And so that's a pagan idea that sort of 
assembling the Christian idea and then 

386
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,630
there's something that's more profound 
than that,

387
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,643
which is that the idea is that the part 
of the human spirit that can accept 

388
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:46,704
death and die and resurrect itself,
which means to continually transform in 

389
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,564
the face of tragedy,
is the thing that's the antidote to the 

390
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:56,730
painful catastrophe of self 
consciousness.

391
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,530
It's a staggering idea.

392
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,363
I mean,
I've studied personality theory for a 

393
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,124
long time and the first thing that I've 
discovered relationship to this as 

394
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,360
almost all the personality theories that
we have that involved movement towards a

395
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:10,194
state of improved health are predicated 
on the idea that people transform 

396
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:16,680
through well through a process of 
painful transformation.

397
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:18,810
It's like disillusion of part of your 
personality,

398
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,590
which is painful in chaotic,
and then the reconstruction of that into

399
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:23,424
a,
into a more fulfilled form and the 

400
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:29,020
reason that's associated with acceptance
of vulnerabilities.

401
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,810
It's van,
it's brilliant.

402
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,673
This is why the military is a virtue 
from the religious perspective is that 

403
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,910
you cannot change until you admit that 
you're wrong and that part of you has to

404
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:39,744
go.
So you have part of admitting your 

405
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:42,274
insufficiency as being willing to 
sacrifice that insufficiency to let it 

406
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,400
go so that something new rise out of the
ashes.

407
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,530
And sometimes that can be your whole 
personality.

408
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,703
You know,
to the degree that your pathological in 

409
00:20:53,141 --> 00:20:54,480
your fundamental structures,
man,

410
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,683
there may be things that you have to 
give up that are huge chunks of your 

411
00:20:58,211 --> 00:20:59,044
life.
So the alternative is to be in pain and 

412
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,620
suffering and misery and that can turn 
into cruelty and murderousness and,

413
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,583
and things that are much,
much more terrible than me are 

414
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,700
suffering.
So that's the idea here.

415
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,010
That's a whole whole story of human 
redemption in St Louis.

416
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,210
Mindboggling brilliant.
And you know,

417
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,044
it took people like took people 
thousands of years to think about this 

418
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:24,430
image or meeting ends of thousands of 
years.

419
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,533
So there's so much thought packed into 
that image is beyond virtually beyond 

420
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:32,680
comprehension.
Remarkable amateur.

421
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:35,883
So here's,
here's some other representations of 

422
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:40,210
trees that I think are quite 
interesting.

423
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:41,044
So the first one here is a sculpture,
a living sculpture that's a 

424
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:48,940
representation of a complete.
You can see how the trees,

425
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,893
the curvature of the trees and makes 
this beautiful arch that is echoed in 

426
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:55,564
the Gothic Cathedral.
So in the gothic cathedrals are stone 

427
00:21:58,121 --> 00:21:58,954
trees essentially being the treats.
And so in some sense they're 

428
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:07,180
representative of the forest.
It's human human beings private home,

429
00:22:07,181 --> 00:22:09,550
but they're representative of something 
more than that too.

430
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:13,570
Because the gothic cathedrals are these 
interesting trees made out of stone that

431
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:17,740
are also places of light.
Because what the gothic cathedrals are,

432
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,633
basically they're what they're made of 
our is the interplay between tree like 

433
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,540
stone and light.
This big glass windows of course,

434
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:26,374
are the light.
And so there's this idea that the 

435
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:31,100
ultimate structure is some tree,
like call them.

436
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,380
That's invadable limelight.
And in some ways that's an analog of the

437
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:36,214
body and its and its function.
So when you say symbols that are 

438
00:22:39,971 --> 00:22:43,130
associated with is.
Well first of all,

439
00:22:43,131 --> 00:22:44,350
when you see,
sorry,

440
00:22:44,351 --> 00:22:45,184
these are echoes,
these are echoes of the tree like 

441
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:47,614
structures that are with him because the
tree structure is a structure that many 

442
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:53,650
biological farms statements.
So you know there's the,

443
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,573
that's the nervous system tree we're 
meditating on for a bit because most of 

444
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,780
us are convinced that our brain is in 
our head.

445
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,810
And really that's not right.
It's just not that accurate.

446
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,673
But look at the.
Look at the dissemination of your 

447
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,973
nervous system throughout your body.
You know your brain is distributed 

448
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:12,800
through your body,
your spinal cord.

449
00:23:12,801 --> 00:23:16,120
It's pretty damn smart.
It can walk by itself.

450
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,520
So for example,
if you take people who have,

451
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:24,300
who are paraplegic but have only,
they've managed spinal damage at a point

452
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:25,834
that doesn't,
they're no longer able to voluntarily 

453
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:28,690
controlled their legs.

454
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:29,523
If you heist the off and put them on a 
treadmill until the floor with their 

455
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:33,604
legs will walk by themselves.
So because your spinal cord is smart 

456
00:23:36,431 --> 00:23:37,264
enough to walk,
I mean you need your brain to tell it 

457
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,084
where to go,
but in some people who are paraplegic 

458
00:23:42,161 --> 00:23:44,830
have been taught to walk in a controlled
fall.

459
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:45,763
So it's quite interesting.
So you know when your spine isn't 

460
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:49,280
stupid,
it's part of your brain.

461
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:52,490
It's just a lower part that's more 
associated with movement.

462
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,353
But you know,
your whole body is full of central 

463
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:55,694
nervous system.
There's more neurons in your autonomic 

464
00:23:57,501 --> 00:23:59,600
nervous system,
which is the part of your nervous system

465
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:00,434
that controls your internal organs that 
the reason your break so you know 

466
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:04,803
you're,
you're stuck right into your body and 

467
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:09,260
the idea that you're,
you're in your brain in some ways.

468
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:11,450
It's like a hangover of the sole theory.

469
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,283
You know,
the Cartesian duality that makes minded 

470
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:18,660
body something separate didn't united.
I mean I believe something do that,

471
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,283
you know,
it definitely underestimates the degree 

472
00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:25,520
to which you're an embodied nervous 
system and that this and that.

473
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:26,354
The structure of your thought is 
predicated on the fact that you're in a 

474
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:32,330
body.
Like you're in a body cognitive creature

475
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,810
and you wouldn't think or be the way you
are without the body.

476
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,000
It's not like an appendage to your 
brain.

477
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,363
You know how it works at all.
You can see the brain and the spinal 

478
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,890
cord as and you can see the neurons 
themselves as tree.

479
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,940
So the tree like structure Echos at 
different levels of the nervous system.

480
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,780
These are very interesting 
representation,

481
00:24:53,781 --> 00:24:58,781
so they have a man in a lotus position.
Why Lotus position?

482
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:06,080
It's another tree metaphor.
So a lotus is a very interesting plant.

483
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,450
So what Lotus is is that it grows on 
water,

484
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,690
so the water steve and maybe the top of 
it's clear,

485
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,280
but then the bottom of the water is 
very,

486
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:17,300
very murky and deep and dark,
and so it represents the dark elements,

487
00:25:17,301 --> 00:25:19,670
sate of the unconscious mind or the 
unknown,

488
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:20,504
that art that we aren't privy to and the
Lotus grows way down into that and then 

489
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:27,410
into the soil below and so it comes out 
of the darkness,

490
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:29,840
the soil and the darkness,
and then through the dark water and then

491
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:30,674
up into the,
into the clear light and on the surface 

492
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:36,250
of the water it blooms and it.
So it opens up like,

493
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:37,443
like a Mandela,
like the stained glass window on the 

494
00:25:39,531 --> 00:25:40,830
right.
It opens up like that.

495
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:41,664
And in the middle of that,
the Buddhists sits in his trying either 

496
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,810
position in the Lotus position and that 
represents enlightenment.

497
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:52,810
And what the whole image represents is 
the coherent ordering of multiple levels

498
00:25:54,561 --> 00:25:55,394
of structure all the way from the primal
material up to the highest level of 

499
00:25:58,941 --> 00:25:59,774
consciousness.
And so the Buddha is like the ultimate 

500
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:04,670
flower of the,
of the Lotus tree.

501
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:07,190
So to speak,
just as in Christianity,

502
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,660
Christ is the ultimate,
the ultimate manifestation of the,

503
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,970
of the tree,
of the knowledge of good and evil.

504
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:17,420
The very,
very analogous ideas and there's reasons

505
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:18,254
for this to it and part of it is part of
it is something like if your 

506
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:26,900
psychophysiology was properly adjusted 
so you weren't working at cross purposes

507
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:28,820
to yourself so that you are nicely 
aligned,

508
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:29,923
straight up,
physically healthy and not defeated 

509
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:35,990
lobster scuttling around the information
flow through your nervous system,

510
00:26:35,991 --> 00:26:36,824
through your body and your mind would be
optimized and that would enable the 

511
00:26:39,771 --> 00:26:42,350
reality that you're attached to and part
of,

512
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:45,780
to through you sort of in an untrammeled
way.

513
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:46,880
You know,
instead of you're,

514
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:50,400
you're all full of bricks and trouble 
and problems and,

515
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,310
and places that are badly aligned and 
you know,

516
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,153
you haven't got the opportunity as a 
consequence to sort of get access to 

517
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,650
your own wisdom as you're sort of a bit 
representation of who you could be.

518
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:02,843
And so part of this and also the like 
the stone and glass that's represented 

519
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,523
represented in the cathedrals is a 
representation of the idea that there 

520
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:13,380
should be a balance between structure 
and light in you.

521
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,214
It's like it's the metaphorical idea and
that you should be properly oriented 

522
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:18,750
physically so that,
so that,

523
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:19,883
so that you're in touch with the ground 
of being in a way that makes you why 

524
00:27:23,301 --> 00:27:24,134
isn't solid.
And that's one of the things that 

525
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:28,880
enables you to take on the tragedy of 
the existence without becoming weak.

526
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,650
I mean these are,
these are roads,

527
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:35,880
so this is a,
this is an eastern Mandela and me.

528
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,910
What,
what it is,

529
00:27:36,911 --> 00:27:39,660
is it's a tunnel into this tree like 
structures,

530
00:27:39,661 --> 00:27:40,494
like a cross section of the tree,
like structures and if the hip you're 

531
00:27:43,111 --> 00:27:43,944
looking into the tree like structure 
down to the micro elements of Ba and 

532
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,293
there's representation there about how 
perfectly aligned and everything is at 

533
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:53,410
every level of,
of,

534
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,430
of resolution and every level of 
manifestation.

535
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:01,590
So he's back that are docs.
That's another way of looking at it.

536
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:05,160
It's the same representation on the 
western side of things.

537
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:05,994
It's like that stayed last window is 
like a cross section of the trunks that 

538
00:28:09,601 --> 00:28:10,434
make up the cathedral.
All these buildings like the medieval 

539
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:15,960
people spend a lot of time building 
those cathedrals,

540
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:16,794
you know,
those things were massive works of 

541
00:28:18,391 --> 00:28:21,330
culture and some of them took hundreds 
of years to build.

542
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,433
I mean,
can you imagine modern people building 

543
00:28:23,371 --> 00:28:26,010
anything that would take like even 100 
years.

544
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,230
It's like we want things to be up in six
months.

545
00:28:28,231 --> 00:28:31,410
You know,
at most those medieval people would work

546
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:32,244
away for like 300 years on the cathedral
if they were really serious about what 

547
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:37,080
it was,
what it represented,

548
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:38,050
you know,
they were trying to,

549
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,540
to produce,
uh,

550
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,583
uh,
the embodiment of the highest ideal in 

551
00:28:42,511 --> 00:28:44,370
architectural form.
You know,

552
00:28:44,371 --> 00:28:46,530
and we've lost a lot of that even on the
campus.

553
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:47,740
You can see that because if,
you know,

554
00:28:47,741 --> 00:28:50,400
if you go over to the sort of classical 
side of the campus,

555
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:51,660
it's all,
you know,

556
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,640
cathedral like in beautiful.
And there's,

557
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:56,580
there's some,
there's some attention being paid to the

558
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:59,540
aesthetic element of the wisdom that's 
embodied their knee.

559
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,410
Come over on this side.
It's a bloody like,

560
00:29:01,411 --> 00:29:03,090
it's hideous.
It's a factory,

561
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,060
you know,
the,

562
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,990
the aesthetic is so terrible.
It's,

563
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,840
it's appalling.
All the buildings that are built to last

564
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:14,050
for 50 years and then they're outdated 
and completely cheap and hideous and

565
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,070
cinder block.

566
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,950
You don't want fluorescent lights.
It's like come on,

567
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,350
you know,
and that they have you guys sit in these

568
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,333
things that are so uncomfortable that 
you wouldn't put your dog in and then 

569
00:29:25,491 --> 00:29:26,570
you know,
it's,

570
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:27,883
well,
it's the loss to lose this sort of 

571
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:29,820
thing.
You know,

572
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,700
there's a big difference between a 
medieval cathedral,

573
00:29:32,701 --> 00:29:34,710
a Gothic cathedral and this flooding 
place,

574
00:29:34,711 --> 00:29:35,544
you know,
but what you're supposed to be in a 

575
00:29:37,281 --> 00:29:40,140
university is something that's like a 
medieval cathedral.

576
00:29:40,141 --> 00:29:43,750
You don't want to say it's a testament 
to the best that mankind has to offer.

577
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,870
You don't put it in a box like this.
It's appalling.

578
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,840
It's appalling.
There's no excuse for it.

579
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,003
I actually think it's a conscious effort
to subvert the values of the university 

580
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,670
because it's not a factory.
You're not factory products.

581
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:58,803
You know,
the university is here to teach you how 

582
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:02,740
to be human beings and that's the 
highest thing that you can aim for.

583
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,770
It's and to subvert that to a lower 
orders.

584
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:09,190
It's the worst thing that can be done.
It's a crime against humanity.

585
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:13,210
There's no excuse for it.
And the ugliness that goes along with it

586
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,044
as part and parcel of the subversion,
it's like a hatred of the highest 

587
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:19,300
values.
Terrible thing.

588
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:24,160
So
you know nobody,

589
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:25,720
none of you are going to go home and 
say,

590
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:29,130
I feel proud that you were sitting in 
this room know,

591
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,503
alright,
so now the Sharman are very strange 

592
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:40,350
people and
it's very difficult to know how long our

593
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:43,930
kick people have been practicing shabbat
rituals,

594
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:44,764
but we know that it's tens of thousands 
of years and we also know that most of 

595
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:49,414
the shamanic rituals and the visions 
that accompany them are induced by some 

596
00:30:52,631 --> 00:30:55,450
kind of hallucinogenic substance.
And it depends,

597
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:58,270
like it depends on the culture what the 
hallucinogenic substances.

598
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,403
But one of the things that's interesting
about them is that they all have 

599
00:31:01,871 --> 00:31:04,660
basically the same chemical structure.
And I'll show you that in a minute.

600
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,400
So the sharpen people are chosen to be 
shown on our.

601
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:10,234
Basically you might think of them as the
repositories of the oral tradition of 

602
00:31:13,391 --> 00:31:14,440
the culture,
you know,

603
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:17,260
because most cultures have for it to be 
a culture,

604
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,480
first of all is it's a culture and it's 
living,

605
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:21,490
it's been around for a tremendous amount
of time,

606
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,813
you know,
and non knowing literate cultures have 

607
00:31:24,941 --> 00:31:29,800
to carry that wisdom that they have with
them in oral form or an embodied form.

608
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,633
So in ritual for more in oral form it 
somebody has to be the fundamental 

609
00:31:33,731 --> 00:31:34,564
repository of that kind of wisdom.
So this sort of the storyteller of the 

610
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,810
tribe and the keeper of the flame so to 
speak.

611
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:43,090
And that's usually the role that the 
shaman have.

612
00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:46,240
And they're the people who are contacted
when something's gone wrong with you,

613
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,373
if you're sick or if you're having real 
trouble mediating with another tribe 

614
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:52,930
member or someone like that or,
or you know,

615
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:56,230
when you're maybe overcome with all 
because you're looking at the night sky,

616
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,093
you know,
it's the showman who's supposed to be 

617
00:31:58,271 --> 00:32:01,450
dealing with the realities that are 
outside of day to day reality.

618
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,300
And so they're like masters of sacred 
space.

619
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:05,134
That's one way of thinking about.
And sometimes they're that way because 

620
00:32:08,021 --> 00:32:08,854
their father was a or maybe their mother
and sometimes it's because they're kind 

621
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:13,270
of peculiar,
you know,

622
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:16,840
there are people who are visionary as,
as part of their temperament.

623
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,470
And we know that visionary penis,
so to speak,

624
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,050
is an element of temperament.
It's associated with trait,

625
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:26,260
openness and that's associated partly 
with intelligence,

626
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,273
but also partly with creativity.
And those things aren't exactly the 

627
00:32:29,321 --> 00:32:30,154
same.
So some people are more imaginative and 

628
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,570
visionary than others.
And in our culture,

629
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:37,060
those would be people who tell great 
stories.

630
00:32:37,061 --> 00:32:37,894
Like j Dot k rowling is a really good 
example of that is she's been a 

631
00:32:40,731 --> 00:32:43,130
shamanically intermediary for,
you know,

632
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,993
for an entire generation of young people
with these massive books that she's 

633
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:47,894
written that you know,
have a mythological core right down to 

634
00:32:50,571 --> 00:32:51,920
their rate,
down to their essence.

635
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:55,640
And Stanley who ran marvel comics.
There's another person like that,

636
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,503
you know,
has had an immense cultural influence 

637
00:32:57,711 --> 00:32:58,544
because he's brought these ancient 
stories back up from the depths and put 

638
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:03,920
them into modern form,
you know,

639
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:04,754
and the writers of these things are 
quite consciously aware of what they're 

640
00:33:06,741 --> 00:33:09,860
doing with regards to the relationship 
with the underlying this.

641
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,470
They're not stupid people.
And even if they were,

642
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:16,040
their readership rapidly informs them if
they're deviating from the,

643
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:16,953
you know,
proper narrative arc of the store 

644
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,573
because those,
all those superheroes have their 

645
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:21,823
dedicated cults of followers and they 
make bloody sure that the new writers 

646
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,263
don't mess around with the story.
And so not only going to only is it top 

647
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,733
down from the writers,
but it's also bottom up from the 

648
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:33,374
readers.
So they're all participating in the 

649
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:37,520
construction of it continuing cultural 
apparatus.

650
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:38,743
So spontaneous vocation,
while you're sort of designed for 

651
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,210
hereditary transmission,
well you know,

652
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:47,930
it's a familial issue and then there's 
the personal quest issue too,

653
00:33:47,931 --> 00:33:51,020
so that sort of associated with 
spontaneous vocation.

654
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,680
So,
and the personal quest element with me,

655
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,633
there's always people in every culture 
who are fundamentally obsessed with the 

656
00:33:58,251 --> 00:33:59,860
pursuit of meaning,
you know,

657
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,733
that's their essential orientation 
towards life and not particularly 

658
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,780
practical like a conscientious person 
would be.

659
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,910
He was a conscientious person,
works you know,

660
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,890
and their,
their head isn't in the clouds,

661
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:12,760
but there are types of people who are,
are not like that at all.

662
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,340
Their heads are in the clouds 
permanently and all.

663
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,423
They're extraordinary and magical.
There've been creative and there are 

664
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:23,400
thought leaders in many ways for the 
culture because a lot of what culture is

665
00:34:23,401 --> 00:34:24,234
learned in an articulated sense.
A lot of what they become conscious of 

666
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,933
is presented to them by artists in 
somewhat unconscious farm long before 

667
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,870
the full meaning of the,
of the,

668
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,690
of what's being portrayed as articulate.
Just like that.

669
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,573
You know,
I just showed you that tree image with 

670
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:42,440
Mary and the church,
you know,

671
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:43,274
on either side of it.
It's not like the person who drew that 

672
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,483
knew what they were doing.
They knew more about what they were 

673
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:50,804
doing.
Then the people who couldn't draw that 

674
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:53,300
sort of thing,
but they were.

675
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,580
They were existing on the edge of their 
knowledge,

676
00:34:55,581 --> 00:34:57,170
making this representation,
thinking,

677
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,320
I'm trying to get at something here.
I'm trying to get at something here,

678
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,303
but they didn't really know what it was 
because the idea is so complex that you 

679
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:05,054
know when,
when people have are coming up with it 

680
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:09,710
over these thousands of years,
your periods,

681
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,693
they don't realize the full impact of 
what it is that they're revealing and 

682
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,950
just as you don't realize your own full 
important

683
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,913
by whatever this is from Eritrea Eliana,
but by but by whatever method he may 

684
00:35:22,611 --> 00:35:25,370
have been designated,
a showman is recognized as such.

685
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:28,340
Only after having received two methods 
of instruction.

686
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:32,470
The first is ecstatic dreams,
trances visions.

687
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,870
The second is traditional shamanic 
techniques,

688
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:39,720
names and functions of the mythology and
genealogy of the plan.

689
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,853
The secret language,
the two full of teaching and is by the 

690
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:46,350
spirits and the old master Shaman 
constitutes initiation.

691
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,420
And so that,
that's very interesting.

692
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,500
Uh,
that's a very interesting representation

693
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:56,160
of the manner in which personal 
revelation becomes knowledge.

694
00:35:56,161 --> 00:35:56,641
So,
you know,

695
00:35:56,641 --> 00:35:57,474
let's say you know,
you're beset by like a very frightful 

696
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,710
series of nightmares.
I mean,

697
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,753
what that's going to do is to drive you 
to try to understand how to represent 

698
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:06,654
what you're having nightmares about in 
terms of the cultural elements that you 

699
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:12,080
have at hand.
Because that's what makes you saying,

700
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:12,923
you know,
if you're having experiences that are 

701
00:36:14,101 --> 00:36:14,934
beyond the norm,
unless you can incorporate them back 

702
00:36:18,271 --> 00:36:20,790
into your culture,
you're alienated from your culture.

703
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:21,624
And that's a terrifying thing.
It means like you might be the only 

704
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:26,940
person that's insane like you and you 
know,

705
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:29,160
it's very,
that's very intolerable for people.

706
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:29,994
It's bad enough to be different,
but to be so different that you're 

707
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,350
incomprehensible.
It's like,

708
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:36,090
can you.
That's the sort of horror you don't want

709
00:36:36,091 --> 00:36:36,990
to encounter.

710
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:37,823
So the Shaman or people who are are 
possessed by like a rich inner fantasy 

711
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:43,104
life,
but who are simultaneously capable of 

712
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,503
taking that and weaving it into the 
cultural mythology that they're part of 

713
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:49,344
it.
That's what makes them saying rather 

714
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:51,204
than insane.
Because schizophrenia is someone who's 

715
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,970
has visionary experience which often 
auditory,

716
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:57,983
no,
they hear voices and they're possessed 

717
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:02,280
by spirits in a sense.
You see them wandering down the street,

718
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,720
you know,
monitoring to their,

719
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,703
to their own internal voices.
But they can't integrate any of that 

720
00:37:07,381 --> 00:37:08,850
with the culture.
So they're just,

721
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,860
they're gone.
They're lost souls.

722
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,280
So the Shaman is someone who does both 
of you know who,

723
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:17,310
who has the vision,
but to incorporate it at the same time.

724
00:37:17,311 --> 00:37:20,310
So someone who is master of the visions 
of not victim of.

725
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,910
And so there's technologies that allow 
people to do that.

726
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,670
A lot of them are associated,
as I said before,

727
00:37:26,671 --> 00:37:31,020
with the use of various solution agentic
substances in Siberia.

728
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,003
The youth who's called to be a showman 
that attracts attention by a strange 

729
00:37:34,111 --> 00:37:35,490
behavior.
For example,

730
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:36,324
the Sikh solitude becomes absent minded,
loves to roam in the woods or 

731
00:37:38,701 --> 00:37:40,770
unfrequently places,
has visions,

732
00:37:40,771 --> 00:37:43,320
and sings in his sleep.
In some instances,

733
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:47,540
this period of incubation is marked by 
quite serious symptoms among the yakuts.

734
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:51,360
The young man sometimes has fits of 
theory and easily loses consciousness,

735
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,940
hides in the forest,
feeds on the bark of trees,

736
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:57,300
throws himself into water and fire and 
cutting themselves with knives.

737
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,530
So those are ordeals in a sense,
you know,

738
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,303
a future show among the Tongass as they 
approach maturity go through a 

739
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:04,704
hysterical or history crisis,
but sometimes their vocation manifests 

740
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:08,940
itself.
At an earlier age,

741
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,630
the boy runs away into the mountains and
remains there for a week or more feeding

742
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:15,210
on animals which tiers two pieces with 
his teeth.

743
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:18,180
He returns to the village filthy and 
blood state,

744
00:38:18,181 --> 00:38:19,014
and it's only after 10 or more days have
passed that he begins to babble 

745
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:22,260
incoherent words.

746
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,480
So you would think from the perspective 
of modern human being says,

747
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,363
this is something like descent into the 
unconscious structures that underlied 

748
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:32,370
normative cognition.
Just like you descend into that at night

749
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,503
when you dream.
So very peculiar process that you are 

750
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:36,754
all perfectly capable of engaging in,
have most of you have virtually no 

751
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:41,570
control over it.
I me,

752
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,160
there are people who dream lucidly you 
know,

753
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,890
and who can exert some conscious control
over their dreams.

754
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,410
Most people can learn how to do that to 
some degree,

755
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,273
but in our culture at least most people 
dream unconsciously and it's just 

756
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:55,264
something that happens to you and not 
something that you're actively engaged 

757
00:38:57,341 --> 00:38:58,174
with.
Strange behavior of future Sharman have 

758
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:05,200
not failed to attract the attention of 
scholars and from the middle of the past

759
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,880
century by which he meant the 19 
century.

760
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,780
Several attempts have been made to 
explain the phenomenon of shamanism as a

761
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,750
mental disorder,
but the problem was wrong.

762
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,583
We put from the one hand,
it's true that Shamans are always are 

763
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:17,044
always have to be neuropathics or 
neurotics are people who are not well 

764
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:22,610
put together mentally.
On other hand,

765
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:23,444
those among them who had been able 
became shalman precisely because they 

766
00:39:25,871 --> 00:39:26,704
had succeeded in becoming cured.
So what that means is these are people 

767
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:31,990
who have undergone some kind of 
existential crisis,

768
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:34,310
sometimes one that's induced.
You know,

769
00:39:34,311 --> 00:39:36,430
as part of the process that turns them 
into Solomon,

770
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:37,264
but they were able to undergo that 
existential crisis and then put 

771
00:39:40,121 --> 00:39:44,700
themselves back together and so that's 
what makes the masters of of the chaotic

772
00:39:44,701 --> 00:39:47,710
ground so to speak,
and so you're starting to fall apart and

773
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:48,544
you don't know what to do while the best
thing you can possibly do is find 

774
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:51,844
someone who's been there and come back 
and that idea of going somewhere and 

775
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:58,280
coming back is also a very,
very common mythological story.

776
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,113
So that's the story of the hobbit.
Truths at the audit goes off on this 

777
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:04,114
quest and he undergoes all sorts of 
trials and the encounters that dragon 

778
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:10,790
that lives underneath everything and he 
gets the gold from the Dragon,

779
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:11,643
which is the information that the dragon
stores and then he comes back to his 

780
00:40:14,051 --> 00:40:14,884
community and he's transformed,
but he's strange like he's going off on 

781
00:40:18,011 --> 00:40:19,060
this big adventure.
Now.

782
00:40:19,061 --> 00:40:19,721
He's like,
well,

783
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:21,730
put together a tough.
And he's also rich,

784
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,890
but he's also peculiar.
When bill,

785
00:40:24,891 --> 00:40:25,570
Bill,
Bill,

786
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:28,030
Bill goes back to the Shire.
You know everybody.

787
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,163
No one's exactly sure what to do with 
him because now he's contaminated with 

788
00:40:31,811 --> 00:40:35,770
everything that he's gone through CCS,
like an agent of chaos himself,

789
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,633
you know,
and someone who's somewhat terrifying 

790
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:39,963
but you know,
useful if you have to have a 

791
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:43,690
consultation about how you might deal 
with the next dragon.

792
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,033
So
now I said that a lot of the shamanic 

793
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:49,504
initiator editorial ritual seem to be 
associated with a loose use of 

794
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:52,834
hallucinogenic drugs and so the most 
common ones that we know about our 

795
00:40:56,141 --> 00:40:58,090
mushrooms,
so for example,

796
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,310
there's this mushroom which many of 
you've probably seen in fairytales,

797
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,313
right?
That's on the cover of fairytales very 

798
00:41:03,971 --> 00:41:04,804
frequently and now it's called a nominee
to miscarry a mushroom and it's 

799
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:10,390
generally viewed as extremely toxic and 
there's some.

800
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,340
There's some reason for that because it 
can,

801
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,293
it can make the people who eat it very 
sick and now and then people do die 

802
00:41:16,031 --> 00:41:16,864
from,
but mostly it's extraordinarily 

803
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:20,320
hallucinogenic.
The Vikings,

804
00:41:20,321 --> 00:41:22,480
for example,
this is quite a terrifying story.

805
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,493
The vikings used to take as needed 
miscarrying mushrooms before they went 

806
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:26,554
on there and pillaging trips and they 
use the mushrooms to transform 

807
00:41:29,201 --> 00:41:31,950
themselves into the equivalent of 
predatory monster,

808
00:41:31,951 --> 00:41:33,480
so they usually,
they're,

809
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,550
they're sort of target was wolves or 
bears and the word Berserk,

810
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:42,080
which is what the vikings used to go 
ma'am bear shirt and so they would train

811
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:42,914
their young men to eat these 
hallucinogenic mushrooms and turn 

812
00:41:45,141 --> 00:41:45,974
themselves into pain free predators and 
then they would take them before they 

813
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:50,070
went onto pillaging rated.

814
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,670
So you just imagine,
you know,

815
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,513
you're sitting there in northern England
and you're in your village and it's all 

816
00:41:55,071 --> 00:41:58,800
peaceful in these bloody crazy fight 
cakes come all feel out of the ocean and

817
00:41:59,090 --> 00:41:59,750
boats,
you know,

818
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,583
the open boats that they've traveled 
across the North Sea it and they're all 

819
00:42:03,951 --> 00:42:07,790
like stoned out of their gourd on 
Amanita must carry a mushroom mushrooms,

820
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:08,624
an old convinced that they're like 
predatory bears and that's exactly how 

821
00:42:11,841 --> 00:42:13,850
they're acting and they have no pain 
whatsoever.

822
00:42:13,851 --> 00:42:15,960
It's like,
ha,

823
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,580
that's not a good seed.
That's not a good scene.

824
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:20,414
You know,
when the vikings come through and they 

825
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:22,490
just destroy everything,
it's like,

826
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,940
so that's they're used.
They were used for Marshall,

827
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:27,700
but there,
there,

828
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:28,973
there,
there were a drug that's used very 

829
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,253
commonly by he goosing shamonic 
experiences among themselves across the 

830
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:38,610
whole northern part of Europe in Asia,
and they grow almost everywhere.

831
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,750
So those are the original magic 
mushroom,

832
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:46,130
magic red and white dots.
And if you look in,

833
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,010
you can see these things in drawings 
everywhere,

834
00:42:49,011 --> 00:42:49,844
especially in fairytales,
very common representation of fairy 

835
00:42:53,381 --> 00:42:54,214
tales.

836
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:58,003
There is some evidence that religions 
that are I suppose in some ways more 

837
00:43:01,551 --> 00:43:02,384
articulated and sophisticated in that 
they're more articulated like 

838
00:43:05,061 --> 00:43:08,090
Christianity say,
compared to the more shock traumatic,

839
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:09,680
uh,
religions.

840
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:13,160
I have also have their roots in 
hallucinogenic experience.

841
00:43:13,161 --> 00:43:15,950
And this may be true to a degree that we
really don't understand.

842
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,900
So for example,
this is something,

843
00:43:17,901 --> 00:43:21,800
this is taken from the manuscript which 
is 11th century,

844
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:25,270
fundamentally 11th to 13th century 
because there were copies of admitted at

845
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,113
different times.
What you see here is my mom and really 

846
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,393
the,
that the snake is associated with 

847
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,573
siliciden mushrooms.
And that's a very characteristic 

848
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:36,794
representation.
And the silicide as much a minute and 

849
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,673
the fruit that eve is feeding to Adam is
part of the siliciden mushrooms for 

850
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,710
speculation,
you know,

851
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,310
among people who are sort of at the 
fringes of,

852
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,520
of evolutionary theory that part of the 
way that human beings levered themselves

853
00:43:52,521 --> 00:43:55,520
up into increased consciousness was by 
the use of machines.

854
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:59,570
We can see in the,
in the representations over there,

855
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:00,583
some of them are absolutely remarkable,
like the one on the top right hand 

856
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,080
corner there,
that's Christ.

857
00:44:06,081 --> 00:44:08,810
And he's standing there like,
like this with his hands up.

858
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:09,644
And then underneath the bottom half of 
that circle is a psilocybin mushroom 

859
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:14,510
with a head,
uh,

860
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:15,483
the,
like the main body of the machine is in 

861
00:44:16,581 --> 00:44:19,030
the same position as Christ's head at 
me,

862
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:22,910
like the offshoots of the mushroom or in
the same position as his hands.

863
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:26,510
So,
well God only knows what that means.

864
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:27,973
So that's,
that's a very strange and remarkable 

865
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:33,120
thing.
We really don't know what to make of it.

866
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:36,600
And there's a lot more investigation to 
be done on that.

867
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:38,973
This is an Osca vine and it's part of 
what the Amazonian shamans use to prove 

868
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:45,624
their hallucinogenic mixtures and no,
none of the Westerners who've gone to 

869
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,820
study the Amazonian showman configure 
it.

870
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,653
How the hell they determined how are 
they ever going to make their mixture 

871
00:44:54,331 --> 00:44:56,070
because it's virtually impossible to 
make.

872
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:57,203
You need to take the vine and then you 
need to take another plant that doesn't 

873
00:45:00,181 --> 00:45:01,014
grow in the same place and you have to 
mix them together in the right 

874
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:03,924
proportions and then you have to cook 
them together for 72 hours and you have 

875
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:08,910
to do that without breathing in any of 
the vapors.

876
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,043
And you know,
there's thousands and thousands of 

877
00:45:11,881 --> 00:45:16,770
different kinds of plants in the 
Amazonian jungle and it isn't obvious in

878
00:45:16,771 --> 00:45:17,604
any way how the people who are using 
these mixtures figured out how to make 

879
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:21,330
them.
And if you ask them,

880
00:45:21,331 --> 00:45:22,164
they say,
well,

881
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:26,310
the plants told us how to do it.
You know that for modern Western people,

882
00:45:26,311 --> 00:45:27,144
that's not much of an explanation,
but it's certainly the explanation that 

883
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,440
the tradesmen seemed to stick to.

884
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,533
And you know,
God only knows how people gather the 

885
00:45:34,381 --> 00:45:35,141
information,
you know,

886
00:45:35,141 --> 00:45:38,150
chimpanzees use medicinal plants,
you know,

887
00:45:38,151 --> 00:45:38,984
they're,
they're capable of finding plants in 

888
00:45:40,981 --> 00:45:43,040
their habitat they could eat that are in
math maker.

889
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:43,874
So one that helped them deal with 
diseases and it's not clear at all how 

890
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:48,294
they figured that out.
So there's lots of mysteries about the 

891
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:52,890
origin of human knowledge,
that's for sure.

892
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,170
So the three sources of potential 
visionary experience,

893
00:45:58,171 --> 00:45:59,004
and this is very interesting.
So here's the biochemical construction 

894
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:06,240
of hallucinogenic chemical.
So the first thing you see on the bottom

895
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:07,074
right is a serotonin molecule.
Now serotonin is in some ways it's the 

896
00:46:10,951 --> 00:46:11,784
major brain neurotransmitter.
The reason I say that is because during 

897
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:19,070
the embryological development,
your brain grows out,

898
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:19,850
you know,
sorta,

899
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:24,180
sorta flowers for and it's guided and 
its development by the serotonin system.

900
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:27,900
That's the system that uses Serotonin as
its primary neurochemical transmitter.

901
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:32,880
So it's not only in our very archaic 
system and it's so old that you share it

902
00:46:32,881 --> 00:46:34,620
as I've mentioned before,
with crustaceans,

903
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:35,543
but it's also the system that sort of 
puts you together as you emerge out of 

904
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:38,754
nothing.
And so you see it continuing your 

905
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:43,140
chemicals structure there,
and then you see these are all different

906
00:46:43,141 --> 00:46:45,510
hallucinogenic substances.
Um,

907
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:47,640
this one is suicide,
for example,

908
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:52,170
and they're all at the empty.
It's a very weird chemical,

909
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:53,303
very illegal.
He entity it produces if part of 

910
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:56,403
IOWASCA,
although Iowasca is made with a plant 

911
00:46:58,471 --> 00:46:59,304
that contains dmt.
And then something called an Mao 

912
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:04,590
inhibitor which decreases the rate at 
which your body breaks it down,

913
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:08,190
like parody.
It produces an instantaneous 10 minute,

914
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,453
a hallucinogenic high that people were.
People constantly report contact with 

915
00:47:13,591 --> 00:47:14,424
aliens.
And there was a psychiatrist who spent 

916
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,110
years documenting DMT experiences.
Every single person,

917
00:47:19,111 --> 00:47:20,180
he,
he couldn't,

918
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:21,043
he,
he walked through the experience with 

919
00:47:22,081 --> 00:47:23,040
recorded the same thing.

920
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:24,023
They're shot out of their body and 
they're immediately in an alien 

921
00:47:25,381 --> 00:47:28,140
landscape,
full whack.

922
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,250
You know what that seems to indicate is 
that from a,

923
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:32,123
from a purely rational perspective,
is that these chemicals produced 

924
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:39,380
characteristic experiences that are so 
associated with visionary experience.

925
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:41,590
They put you in something that's like a 
dream state.

926
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:42,641
Now,
oddly,

927
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:45,550
the dream state seems to be somewhat 
similar from person to person,

928
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:48,740
but there are ways that in some sense 
that the young,

929
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:49,613
the contents of the unconscious mind can
be made manifest to the conscious mind 

930
00:47:52,841 --> 00:47:57,220
at least for for brief periods of time.
Sometimes that can be clearly horrifying

931
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,290
because sometimes people take these,
these,

932
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,453
these chemicals and have like the worst 
experience of their life and part of 

933
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:04,654
that seems to be associated with the 
sort of thing that might happen to you 

934
00:48:07,331 --> 00:48:09,160
in psychotherapy.
So for example,

935
00:48:09,161 --> 00:48:09,994
if you were convinced that your psyche 
wasn't very well ordered and you are 

936
00:48:12,611 --> 00:48:13,444
harboring sort of dark secrets and lies 
and all the sorts of things that might 

937
00:48:16,091 --> 00:48:16,924
complicate your life and all sorts of 
femineity millennial pathology and 

938
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:24,100
cultural baggage and like the horrors 
that sort of live inside your brain,

939
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:25,520
you know,
in psychotherapy,

940
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:29,200
sort of confront those one by one in a 
hallucinogenic experience.

941
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,630
You might confront all of those at the 
same time.

942
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:32,683
You know,
and for,

943
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:36,160
for many people that's exactly 
equivalent to a quick trip to hell.

944
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:40,280
It's not something they'd rather repeat.
So why,

945
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,850
why things are set up that way?
Well,

946
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:43,743
who knows?
I mean we don't really understand these 

947
00:48:45,731 --> 00:48:46,564
things so
we don't understand the relationship 

948
00:48:50,351 --> 00:48:51,184
between the parts of the brain that are 
articulated and conscious and then the 

949
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:54,514
lower parts that are sort of the 
repositories of traumatic information 

950
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:00,880
and there's deeper mysteries that we 
don't understand too.

951
00:49:00,881 --> 00:49:01,714
So it turns out,
I don't feel if any of you are familiar 

952
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:06,220
with the term fee genesis,
but there,

953
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:07,063
there are studies of epic genetics now 
that show that there are certain 

954
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:10,864
experiences that alter your genetic 
structure and while we know that partly 

955
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,750
because when like if you put yourself in
the new situation,

956
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:21,190
a radically new situation,
new genes will turn on inside of you and

957
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:24,190
they'll coach for new proteins and 
they'll build new structures for you.

958
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,060
So new neurological structure sometimes.
And that's part of how you can adapt.

959
00:49:28,061 --> 00:49:28,894
And it's also part of the reason why 
banging yourself against various 

960
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:32,590
obstacles,
you know,

961
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:33,463
in a,
in a kind of what systematic way is a 

962
00:49:35,981 --> 00:49:38,530
good way of expanding your range of 
capabilities.

963
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,513
So we know that experience can turn new 
new genetic processes on that are there 

964
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,620
sort of a latent prior to that,
but what we didn't know was that some of

965
00:49:47,621 --> 00:49:48,454
those experiences transform your genetic
structures in a way that you can 

966
00:49:51,671 --> 00:49:52,504
transmit to your children.
So in that that's the Lamarckian 

967
00:49:55,721 --> 00:49:59,200
evolution and no one ever ever 
hypothesized that that was possible.

968
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,190
But you can look it up.
It's,

969
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:01,143
it's mainstream science now.
Although you know people are still not 

970
00:50:03,371 --> 00:50:04,204
really sure what to do about it,
how to think about it from a conceptual 

971
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:09,640
perspective because that sort of thing 
wasn't supposed to be possible.

972
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:11,103
So No.
So we have no idea to to what level of 

973
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,013
being your experiences can be encoded 
and we really don't know how you encode 

974
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:22,234
experience anyways.
We don't know what the fundamental 

975
00:50:24,071 --> 00:50:24,904
structures of your memory are,
how that's associated with your 

976
00:50:27,531 --> 00:50:28,364
conceptions of time and space are and 
how that's related to your ongoing 

977
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:31,724
experience.
Like those things are deeply mysterious 

978
00:50:33,441 --> 00:50:34,274
to us and what happens,
at least in parts of the gins is that 

979
00:50:37,191 --> 00:50:38,024
they seem to take all the horrors and 
terrorist that you haven't dealt with 

980
00:50:40,731 --> 00:50:42,560
it,
just put them in your face now.

981
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,740
And that's part of the shamanic 
experience.

982
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:48,710
And so it's not something for people to 
take lightly and you know,

983
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:51,800
and generally generally people don't.
So.

984
00:50:51,801 --> 00:50:52,634
But I've often found that it was very 
strange that these chemicals produced 

985
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,300
experiences that are so strange that our
culture instantly deemed illegal.

986
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,673
You know,
for me it's like looking at what 

987
00:51:01,881 --> 00:51:02,714
happened back in the Middle Ages when 
the Catholic church we went after 

988
00:51:05,391 --> 00:51:08,750
Galileo because he had something strange
to say about the mood.

989
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,810
It's like these experiences have tapped 
into something that's a very,

990
00:51:11,811 --> 00:51:12,644
very primordial element of human 
existence and associated say with the 

991
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:16,943
shamanic rituals that have been going on
for tens of thousands of years and that 

992
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:23,150
human cultures have always used to 
orient themselves.

993
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,313
They're so added there.
There's so much anathema to our current 

994
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:28,120
culture that,
you know,

995
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,093
we,
we punish people severely books with 

996
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,320
very,
very peculiar behavior.

997
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:34,723
So although there is no doubt that this 
sort of thing is dangerous and very 

998
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:39,800
peculiar,
but you know,

999
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:41,983
so the seanad report relatively constant
types of experiences when they're 

1000
00:51:46,911 --> 00:51:49,310
undergoing their transformative 
experiences.

1001
00:51:49,311 --> 00:51:51,890
And here's a couple of them.
One is climbing the world,

1002
00:51:51,891 --> 00:51:53,030
treat.
We've already.

1003
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:54,103
We've already talked about the world 
treat and what that seems to be if you 

1004
00:51:56,511 --> 00:51:57,344
look at the reports of the Sharman is 
that they seem they're consciousness 

1005
00:52:00,411 --> 00:52:01,244
seems to be able to to move itself up 
and down levels of analysis that aren't 

1006
00:52:04,881 --> 00:52:08,330
necessarily available to you in your 
normal state of consciousness.

1007
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:09,163
Now,
whether or not that's a real phenomenon 

1008
00:52:10,351 --> 00:52:14,540
or whether or not part associated with 
the dream isn't exactly clear.

1009
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,740
So I'm.
Part of it is for example,

1010
00:52:18,741 --> 00:52:19,574
that you know,
when the show him with become convinced 

1011
00:52:20,811 --> 00:52:24,590
that they can communicate with things 
like plants at a very fundamental level,

1012
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:28,070
but they are also capable of when they 
climb up the tree for example,

1013
00:52:28,071 --> 00:52:32,150
of entering sort of the realm of their 
ancestors and communing with them.

1014
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,380
And I just read a book here recently 
about the revival of Mongolian shamanism

1015
00:52:36,381 --> 00:52:37,214
and the Mongolian situation is kind of 
interesting because it was a pretty 

1016
00:52:39,771 --> 00:52:41,690
archaic culture and then the Soviets 
came in,

1017
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,460
they're like carbonized it,
you know,

1018
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:44,294
which was sort of economically useful,
but socially it was napster catastrophe 

1019
00:52:47,871 --> 00:52:48,704
because the Soviets were murderous 
beyond belief and then in 1989 and they 

1020
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:52,274
just left and so the Mongolians like 
they were completely up in the air then 

1021
00:52:55,431 --> 00:52:58,490
because their traditional culture,
it'd be fragmented and you know,

1022
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:02,960
the whole communist thing was a bust and
they reverted back to shamanic practices

1023
00:53:02,961 --> 00:53:03,794
and the shop and told them that part of 
the reason that they were all suffering 

1024
00:53:05,631 --> 00:53:08,770
was because they had lost contact with 
their ancestral spirits.

1025
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:09,603
And partly what they meant by that was 
that the continuity of the culture had 

1026
00:53:13,401 --> 00:53:15,950
been disrupted and so people were 
identity.

1027
00:53:15,951 --> 00:53:16,784
This knowing.
It was funny because when Aleksandr 

1028
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,713
Solzhenitsyn wrote about the Soviet 
Union and he wrote the volume volume he 

1029
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:28,800
wrote extensively about about the,
the Soviet experience,

1030
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:29,813
his eventual conclusion.
Was that the best route for the Soviets 

1031
00:53:33,181 --> 00:53:34,014
to take after the collapse of communism 
would be a return to the sort of 

1032
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:38,163
evolutionary process of development that
characterized their exploration of 

1033
00:53:41,401 --> 00:53:44,850
Orthodox Christianity because you have 
to fall back to something you know,

1034
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:49,020
because people need a meaning structure 
and you know a modern people have a hard

1035
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:52,370
time with incomprehensible religious 
meanings.

1036
00:53:52,371 --> 00:53:56,100
Structures because we demand a certain 
amount of rational clarity,

1037
00:53:56,101 --> 00:54:01,101
but there's a problem with that because 
the absolute mysteries of life cannot be

1038
00:54:01,591 --> 00:54:02,424
formulated with rational clarity.
You have to kind of encapsulate them in 

1039
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:10,200
a mystery that's partially 
understandable because because otherwise

1040
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,850
they stay completely out of your grasp,
you know,

1041
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,880
and you have no answer to the question.

1042
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,321
You know,
well,

1043
00:54:15,321 --> 00:54:17,890
what's the ultimate purpose of life?
You know what?

1044
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:21,210
You're not going to be able to get that 
answer in a really tight box.

1045
00:54:21,211 --> 00:54:24,150
You know that you could open up in this,
just going to provide all the answers.

1046
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:27,840
It's going to be murky because partly 
because it has to apply to everyone,

1047
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,213
but the fact that it's murky and 
symbolic in a sense and sort of 

1048
00:54:31,951 --> 00:54:32,784
multifaceted.
It doesn't mean it's unnecessary or 

1049
00:54:34,621 --> 00:54:36,090
wrong,
and you know,

1050
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:40,110
the more I've studied the theories that 
underlying personality theory,

1051
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:40,944
the more I've become convinced and for 
me convinced beyond a doubt that that 

1052
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,200
connection,
our connection to the,

1053
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:50,070
to the archaic structures of the past 
that defined our culture.

1054
00:54:50,071 --> 00:54:52,350
So like without that,
you're without roots,

1055
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:53,970
you know,
and that makes you a week.

1056
00:54:53,971 --> 00:54:55,890
That's the big problem.
It makes you weak.

1057
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:59,130
There's nothing to you.
Every whim can possess you.

1058
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:03,160
Every stupid political idea that comes 
along is instantly you're gone.

1059
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,050
You know when you're certainly capable 
of going crazy with masses of people and

1060
00:55:07,051 --> 00:55:10,410
all sorts of insane ways.
It has direct consequences.

1061
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:12,270
Do you have to be grounded in something?

1062
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,550
According to a Yakut informant,
the spirits carry the future to hell and

1063
00:55:18,551 --> 00:55:22,140
shot him in a house for three years.
It doesn't sound very pleasant.

1064
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,290
Here he undergoes is initiation.
The spirits cut off this,

1065
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:28,110
have they set off to one side,
for the novice,

1066
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:32,580
for the novice must watch his own 
dismemberment with his own eyes and they

1067
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:36,210
hack his body to bits which are later 
distributed among the spirits of various

1068
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:37,044
sicknesses.
It is only on this condition that the 

1069
00:55:38,641 --> 00:55:40,830
future Sharman will obtain the power of 
healing.

1070
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:45,240
His bones are then covered with new 
flesh and in some cases he is also given

1071
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:46,083
new blood,
and so the the fundamental structure of 

1072
00:55:48,001 --> 00:55:52,230
the shamanic ritual seems to be that the
death of the,

1073
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:53,183
of the experiencing personally,
they seem to experience that as a 

1074
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,780
physiological transformation.
So it's,

1075
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:01,170
it's the conscious experience of their 
own depth and their dissolution,

1076
00:56:01,171 --> 00:56:01,590
right?

1077
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:02,580
Great.
To you know,

1078
00:56:02,581 --> 00:56:05,430
the,
the dust and ashes from which from which

1079
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:09,420
human beings originally arise.
What are the specific characteristics of

1080
00:56:09,421 --> 00:56:12,120
shamanic initiations aside from the 
candidates?

1081
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:14,790
Dismemberment is this reduction to the 
state of the skeleton.

1082
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:16,603
We are here in the presence of a very 
ancient religious idea which belongs to 

1083
00:56:19,411 --> 00:56:20,244
the hunter culture.
Bone symbolizes the final route of 

1084
00:56:22,621 --> 00:56:23,454
animal life.
The mold from which the flesh 

1085
00:56:24,971 --> 00:56:25,804
continually rises.
It's from the bone that men and animals 

1086
00:56:28,001 --> 00:56:28,834
are reborn for a time.
They may entertain themselves in an 

1087
00:56:31,091 --> 00:56:31,924
existence of the flesh.
Then they die and their life is reduced 

1088
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:35,404
to the essence concentrated in the 
skeleton from which they will be born 

1089
00:56:38,111 --> 00:56:39,480
again.
And that,

1090
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,190
and then people who undergo these 
experiences seem to,

1091
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:43,383
as I said,
they seem to experience their own death 

1092
00:56:44,831 --> 00:56:45,664
in a conscious manner.
That's a very difficult thing to 

1093
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:52,741
understand.
You know,

1094
00:56:57,961 --> 00:57:00,750
it's not obvious either for people who 
aren't,

1095
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,640
what would you say
who,

1096
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:09,470
who aren't accustomed to those sorts of 
extremes of experiences.

1097
00:57:09,471 --> 00:57:10,304
It's not obvious at all how much of this
sort of thing you have to become 

1098
00:57:12,171 --> 00:57:13,490
conscious of,
you know,

1099
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,353
because death is obviously one of the 
things that terrifies people deeply and 

1100
00:57:17,361 --> 00:57:20,420
it's not obvious how you should accustom
yourself to that.

1101
00:57:20,421 --> 00:57:23,090
So I can tell you a story that's quite 
quite interesting.

1102
00:57:23,091 --> 00:57:23,924
I had a client at one point who was a 
vegetarian and that actually turns out 

1103
00:57:28,041 --> 00:57:28,874
to be irrelevant.
Part of the reason that she was a 

1104
00:57:29,841 --> 00:57:33,170
vegetarian because she couldn't even go 
into a like a,

1105
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,570
a,
a what?

1106
00:57:34,571 --> 00:57:37,160
A grocery store where there was a 
butcher's department.

1107
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,760
Like she couldn't even look at the array
of neat.

1108
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:40,603
It just horrified her and it was 
associated with something that was like 

1109
00:57:43,311 --> 00:57:46,730
a sleeping beauty complex for her 
because when she was a child,

1110
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:50,000
your parents treated her like she was a 
fairy princess and they really protected

1111
00:57:50,001 --> 00:57:52,130
your from,
from everything you know.

1112
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:53,263
Remember,
how many of you have seen Walt Disney's 

1113
00:57:54,261 --> 00:57:56,000
sleeping beauty?
Yeah.

1114
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:58,060
Well that's interesting and that so many
of you would.

1115
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,033
You remember there's a.
When the girl is born and sleeping 

1116
00:58:01,401 --> 00:58:04,040
beauty is born,
they don't invite someone to the,

1117
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:06,530
to the Christie,
who do they not invite

1118
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,360
the wish,
right?

1119
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,750
I think it's maleficent in sleeping 
beauty.

1120
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:14,630
I think that's her name.
She's the one that turns into the dragon

1121
00:58:14,631 --> 00:58:16,670
of chaos at the end of the story.
Well,

1122
00:58:16,671 --> 00:58:17,960
there's a,
there's a message in there.

1123
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:18,794
It's like,
do not shield your young people from 

1124
00:58:21,381 --> 00:58:25,430
natural catastrophe because it makes 
them unconscious and it'll come back and

1125
00:58:25,431 --> 00:58:27,260
revisit them when they fall.
Especially,

1126
00:58:27,261 --> 00:58:28,100
you know,
when they grow up,

1127
00:58:28,101 --> 00:58:31,310
when they hit puberty and come back with
force and if they're unconscious,

1128
00:58:31,311 --> 00:58:32,144
like if they're not prepared,
the horror of that will make them 

1129
00:58:34,341 --> 00:58:36,780
unconscious.
And that's what happened to this girl,

1130
00:58:36,781 --> 00:58:40,160
like she was sleeping 22 hours a day 
when she came to see me.

1131
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:43,790
It's like she was a fairy princess until
she hit puberty and then she was like an

1132
00:58:43,791 --> 00:58:46,130
evil slopped as far as their parents 
were concerned.

1133
00:58:46,131 --> 00:58:47,950
It was like bang,
things that switch,

1134
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:49,250
things switched completely.

1135
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:50,323
Of course that was horrifying to her,
but it was also tangled up for her with 

1136
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:56,960
kind of the horror of life in general.
And that was one of the things that made

1137
00:58:56,961 --> 00:59:00,620
her so sensitive to the saint at these 
displays of these displays of me,

1138
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:02,390
which are of course quite horrifying,
you know,

1139
00:59:02,391 --> 00:59:04,700
it's kind of remarkable that you can 
wander through the,

1140
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,630
you know,
you know,

1141
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,240
maybe a little bit of discomfort,
but you know,

1142
00:59:08,241 --> 00:59:09,074
it's slaughterhouse stuff and you know,
to be normal is to be able to tolerate 

1143
00:59:13,011 --> 00:59:14,270
that.
And that's quite strange.

1144
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:15,890
She couldn't tolerate it at all.
So,

1145
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,450
you know,
I took her to butcher shops.

1146
00:59:17,451 --> 00:59:19,370
Now Amanda,
because you do that with people,

1147
00:59:19,371 --> 00:59:20,204
if they have an identifiable feared,
it's actually quite easy to start the 

1148
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:23,943
psychotherapeutic process because you 
start to expose them voluntarily to the 

1149
00:59:27,141 --> 00:59:28,550
things that they want to avoid.

1150
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:29,743
So you know,
I took her into a butcher shop and 

1151
00:59:31,011 --> 00:59:32,690
cheesy,
don't just flipped her over,

1152
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:33,573
you know,
she sat in the car afterwards and cried 

1153
00:59:34,881 --> 00:59:35,714
for 20 minutes and told me about how 
terrible life wasn't that she couldn't 

1154
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:41,940
live in the face of all this 
dismemberment and constant death.

1155
00:59:41,941 --> 00:59:46,310
And she was also very,
very inclined towards identification,

1156
00:59:46,311 --> 00:59:47,690
you know,
with the little cute animals,

1157
00:59:47,691 --> 00:59:50,740
which is generally a fairly solid 
feminine trait,

1158
00:59:50,741 --> 00:59:51,574
right?
Because females are very attracted to 

1159
00:59:52,701 --> 00:59:53,534
things that are cute and cute.
Things are basically infant tile and 

1160
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:56,961
helpless.
Right?

1161
00:59:56,961 --> 00:59:59,210
That's sort of what activates the cute 
detection.

1162
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:00,403
You know,
it's part of,

1163
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:03,500
of maternal behavior.
It's really an part,

1164
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,353
you know,
because if you didn't find your baby's 

1165
01:00:05,091 --> 01:00:07,000
cute,
you'd really be in trouble because there

1166
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:09,280
are a lot of trouble,
you know,

1167
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:10,123
and they.
And they push you because they require 

1168
01:00:11,031 --> 01:00:11,720
so much care.

1169
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,640
So they bloody well better be cute and 
smiling,

1170
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:15,140
you know,
make friends with you.

1171
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:16,280
So,
so,

1172
01:00:16,281 --> 01:00:17,114
but,
but she would like was this hyper 

1173
01:00:18,171 --> 01:00:20,990
identified with like little vulnerable 
animals,

1174
01:00:20,991 --> 01:00:21,650
you know,
and,

1175
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:25,310
and that's not good because she wasn't 
just a little vulnerable Annabelle,

1176
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:26,443
she was also partly a Predator and human
beings are partly predators and you 

1177
01:00:29,121 --> 01:00:30,560
know,
maybe you think that's terrible,

1178
01:00:30,561 --> 01:00:31,394
but that's how it is.
And the predatory part of yourself 

1179
01:00:34,581 --> 01:00:37,010
better be incorporated and used because 
otherwise,

1180
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:39,710
first of all you'll be weak without it.
And second of all,

1181
01:00:39,711 --> 01:00:41,510
if you don't incorporate it,
believe me,

1182
01:00:41,511 --> 01:00:42,344
that doesn't make it go away.
It will just go out and have fun on its 

1183
01:00:44,571 --> 01:00:47,450
own in ways that are unconscious that 
you don't control.

1184
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:51,290
So she was a really good dreamer.
This girl.

1185
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:52,124
And she could,
she actually had lucid dreams quite 

1186
01:00:54,051 --> 01:00:54,884
remarkable.
And sometimes she could either ask her 

1187
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:58,760
dream characters what they symbolized.

1188
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,170
Right in the dream,
you know,

1189
01:01:00,171 --> 01:01:03,590
is the only time I've ever seen that.
Although I've had some lucid dreamers in

1190
01:01:03,591 --> 01:01:04,424
my practice and one day she had this 
dream because she was really having a 

1191
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:10,130
hard time finishing university.
It was like their sixth year,

1192
01:01:10,131 --> 01:01:10,964
seventh year or something like that and 
that was partly because she slept all 

1193
01:01:13,191 --> 01:01:14,024
the time and then she wouldn't get 
anything done like she was trying to 

1194
01:01:15,891 --> 01:01:18,350
sleep to avoid consciousness,
right.

1195
01:01:18,351 --> 01:01:19,184
To avoid being alive because 
consciousness was too painful for her 

1196
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,840
and so she had a dream one day that she 
met.

1197
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:26,000
Actually I'm mixing two dreams here 
together,

1198
01:01:26,001 --> 01:01:26,834
but it doesn't matter because it's just 
sort of just sort of collapses the 

1199
01:01:29,391 --> 01:01:30,620
narrative.
She,

1200
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:33,860
she dreamt that she met at Gypsy that 
was traveling through the forest and the

1201
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:37,100
Gypsy told her that unless she was able,
unless you would be willing to work in a

1202
01:01:37,101 --> 01:01:38,900
slaughterhouse,
she'd never finished her degree.

1203
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:40,183
So she came.
She came and told me that dream and I 

1204
01:01:41,901 --> 01:01:44,480
thought,
well slaughterhouse,

1205
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:47,210
that seems a little bit difficult to 
arrange.

1206
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,670
When she wasn't sure she could handle 
that anyways.

1207
01:01:49,671 --> 01:01:50,504
And I said,
well,

1208
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:53,660
is there anything that you can think of?
If you imagine something,

1209
01:01:53,661 --> 01:01:57,740
is there anything that you can think of 
that might serve as a substitute?

1210
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,170
And she came back to me about a week 
later and she says,

1211
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:02,540
she said,
I want to see an embalming.

1212
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,550
And I thought,
wow,

1213
01:02:04,551 --> 01:02:06,350
that's,
that's rough.

1214
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:07,101
That's no,
no,

1215
01:02:07,101 --> 01:02:08,540
no doubt about that.
That's rough.

1216
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:09,374
So I phoned around to a bunch of 
different funeral homes and I told them 

1217
01:02:13,341 --> 01:02:18,140
that I had a client who was so terrified
of death that she couldn't even live and

1218
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:19,123
that,
you know,

1219
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:20,123
I want her to bring her to the funeral 
home and walk through it and if it was 

1220
01:02:22,861 --> 01:02:26,320
possible to see an embalming preparation
and um,

1221
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:28,050
they were very understanding.

1222
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:29,640
It was quite interesting because of 
course,

1223
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:31,680
funeral parlor people are kind of 
strange people,

1224
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:32,514
right?
Because they're dealing with death all 

1225
01:02:33,631 --> 01:02:36,270
the time.
It's like they're daisy life,

1226
01:02:36,271 --> 01:02:37,920
you know,
and they get so it's,

1227
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:41,430
well they're not dying of horror every 
night,

1228
01:02:41,431 --> 01:02:43,350
you know,
that they are able to deal with it,

1229
01:02:43,351 --> 01:02:46,170
which is a good thing because we'd been 
knee deep in bodies otherwise.

1230
01:02:46,171 --> 01:02:46,920
Right.
Someone,

1231
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,660
someone has to do with this sort of 
work.

1232
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:51,530
So.
And apparently you can specialize it.

1233
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:54,060
And so what that all means,
unless you think,

1234
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:55,050
you know,
funeral partners,

1235
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:55,903
directors are like completely gone human
in some fundamental way clearly 

1236
01:03:00,571 --> 01:03:01,404
indicates that it's possible for a 
normal person to become so conversant 

1237
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:08,540
with death that it's daily business and 
you know,

1238
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:11,910
emergency department people are in that 
sort of situation.

1239
01:03:11,911 --> 01:03:15,870
And people who drive ambulances,
like human beings are bloody tough.

1240
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:16,943
You know,
we can take something like facing death 

1241
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:20,420
and turn it into an everyday occurrence.

1242
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:21,283
It's like,
it's kind of horrifying in a sense to 

1243
01:03:22,531 --> 01:03:24,880
think that you could be that harsh in a 
way,

1244
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:26,550
you know.
But by the same token,

1245
01:03:26,551 --> 01:03:28,560
you know,
you don't want to run away screaming the

1246
01:03:28,561 --> 01:03:30,330
first time there's an emergency in your 
life.

1247
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,470
You know,
what the hell good are you?

1248
01:03:31,471 --> 01:03:32,304
If you know someone close to you gets 
really sick and all you can do is whine 

1249
01:03:34,891 --> 01:03:36,870
and sniffle about it because it's so 
hard on you.

1250
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,520
It's like it's not your attorney for 
that.

1251
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:40,800
You should be strong so that you can 
help them.

1252
01:03:40,801 --> 01:03:43,470
And that means that we have to be able 
to face these sorts of things.

1253
01:03:43,471 --> 01:03:45,210
So anyways,
we went to the funeral parlor,

1254
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:49,080
which is quite a weird thing for me too 
because I actually have rather squeamish

1255
01:03:49,081 --> 01:03:52,500
stomach kind of disgust sensitive.
And so it's hard for me,

1256
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:55,440
especially odors just,
they're just not good for me at all.

1257
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,750
But um,
you know,

1258
01:03:57,751 --> 01:04:00,000
so I could have never been a surgeon or 
anything like that.

1259
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:00,983
But we went to the funeral parlor and I 
found it extremely interesting because 

1260
01:04:04,951 --> 01:04:05,784
first of all actually need to know how 
these things operate because at some 

1261
01:04:09,031 --> 01:04:10,660
point you're going to be called upon to 
deal with.

1262
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:13,800
Maybe it'd be nice if you had a little 
knowledge beforehand so that,

1263
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:14,903
you know,
you didn't only have the grief that was 

1264
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:17,873
knocking you over,
but all the novelty that was associated 

1265
01:04:19,741 --> 01:04:21,610
with trying to orient yourself in that 
space.

1266
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:22,853
So we talked to the funeral director and
we talked to him about how he sort of 

1267
01:04:25,711 --> 01:04:28,530
managed his day to day encounters with 
death.

1268
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,850
And you know,
he said he,

1269
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:30,743
he sort of saw it as his role to 
shepherd people through the grieving 

1270
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:33,834
process and that for him and had made 
them in some ways more acutely aware of 

1271
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:41,400
the affinity of life obviously,
but then also made a more conscious of,

1272
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:44,250
you know,
of each day of the passing of each day.

1273
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:45,533
And you know,
that might be one of the things that 

1274
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:48,750
salutary about facing your own 
mortality.

1275
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:51,360
It's like waste time.
Like here's,

1276
01:04:51,361 --> 01:04:52,194
here's a good question for you guys.
How many of you waste more than four 

1277
01:04:55,051 --> 01:04:57,470
hours a day?
Okay.

1278
01:04:57,830 --> 01:04:58,561
Okay.
So,

1279
01:04:58,561 --> 01:04:59,394
so I would say the reason you do that is
because you haven't really faced the 

1280
01:05:02,311 --> 01:05:04,710
reality of your own death.
If you had done that,

1281
01:05:04,711 --> 01:05:08,040
you would stop doing that.
You would not waste time,

1282
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:09,763
you know,
and we could do a quick economic 

1283
01:05:11,011 --> 01:05:12,690
analysis.
I'd like to do this with people.

1284
01:05:12,691 --> 01:05:15,660
So what do you think your time's worth 
an our.

1285
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:20,110
Yes.
We know it's at least 10 bucks,

1286
01:05:20,111 --> 01:05:20,944
right?
Because that's

1287
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:26,920
the minimum value society puts on your 
labor is $10 an hour.

1288
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:28,090
Okay?
But you know,

1289
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:29,063
you're,
you're smart and healthy and young and 

1290
01:05:30,821 --> 01:05:33,280
so each hour is an investment in the 
future,

1291
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:34,263
so it has to be considered in that 
matter because you're one of your hours 

1292
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:40,660
is worth more to you than one of my 
hours is worth to me because you have so

1293
01:05:40,661 --> 01:05:42,670
much of your future life still depending
on it.

1294
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:46,570
So that's a big deal.
So I would say $50 an hour.

1295
01:05:46,571 --> 01:05:47,404
It's probably reasonable for what you 
guys are worth at somewhere between 10 

1296
01:05:49,691 --> 01:05:51,460
and 50 anyways.
So you know,

1297
01:05:51,461 --> 01:05:52,800
let's assume 50,
hey,

1298
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:55,360
it's 200 bucks a day.
It's 1400 bucks a week,

1299
01:05:55,470 --> 01:05:59,140
it's 5,600 bucks a month,
$65,000 a year.

1300
01:05:59,141 --> 01:06:01,480
It's like you want to waste it,
go right ahead.

1301
01:06:01,481 --> 01:06:03,700
But that's what it's costing you at 
minimum,

1302
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,170
you know?
And you know,

1303
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:08,200
you might think,
well no because I'm not getting paid.

1304
01:06:08,201 --> 01:06:12,070
It's like wrong.
You're paying for your studies.

1305
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:15,610
You just get paid 10 years from now.
It's just deferred income.

1306
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:18,640
And there's a huge difference between 
people who have bees and aches,

1307
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:22,270
you know,
like these door shut his doors open.

1308
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:24,790
And so you know,
you wasted that time,

1309
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:27,730
you will bloody pay for it and you don't
get it back either.

1310
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:29,170
So you know,
if you're,

1311
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:32,350
if you're awake and you know that this 
is waiting for you,

1312
01:06:32,351 --> 01:06:33,184
and if there's only so much time you 
have that can bloody well wake you up 

1313
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,790
and stop you from wasting your time 
because you don't have that much of it.

1314
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:46,390
This is a medieval representation of the
representation,

1315
01:06:46,391 --> 01:06:47,224
obviously,
because it's a crucifix and it has a 

1316
01:06:48,431 --> 01:06:49,360
snake on it.
It's not.

1317
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:51,250
But it's a tree snake thing,
you know,

1318
01:06:51,251 --> 01:06:52,084
and it's actually an echo.
There's a story in the Old Testament 

1319
01:06:54,221 --> 01:06:58,030
about Moses leading his people through 
the desert and it's sort of a,

1320
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:00,130
you know,
they've escaped from tyranny.

1321
01:07:00,131 --> 01:07:03,190
So that's the previous place of order 
and now they're in chaos because they've

1322
01:07:03,191 --> 01:07:05,170
left here at eight.
So they're all wandering round,

1323
01:07:05,171 --> 01:07:07,870
sort of without their heads.
They don't know which way they're going.

1324
01:07:07,871 --> 01:07:10,870
They're trying to run away from 
something that's bad at,

1325
01:07:10,871 --> 01:07:13,090
toward something that's good,
but they don't know where they are.

1326
01:07:13,091 --> 01:07:15,050
And so they get all kind of,
you know,

1327
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:15,903
fighting and break into factions and 
then they start worshiping false gods 

1328
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:22,210
like golden calves and fragmentation 
under pressure.

1329
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:24,010
And so,
um,

1330
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:24,903
God gets irritated at them and he throws
a bunch of poisonous snakes into the 

1331
01:07:27,221 --> 01:07:28,470
desert because,
you know,

1332
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,000
he's such an easy guy to get along with 
say,

1333
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:31,983
throws a bunch of poisonous snakes and 
they're nickel run biting all these 

1334
01:07:33,971 --> 01:07:36,310
people who are not being faithful.

1335
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:37,143
And so all the people who are doubting 
Moses are starting to freak out because 

1336
01:07:41,241 --> 01:07:43,270
they keep getting hit by all these 
poisonous snakes.

1337
01:07:43,271 --> 01:07:45,450
And so they finally called them Moses to
ask.

1338
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,660
I'd be like,
you know,

1339
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:48,680
call off the poisonous snakes.
There'll be,

1340
01:07:48,681 --> 01:07:49,514
hey,
I'm just calling all the poisonous 

1341
01:07:50,111 --> 01:07:50,944
snakes.
And God says to Moses to build up like 

1342
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:57,220
a,
a staff with a brown snake on it.

1343
01:07:57,221 --> 01:07:59,710
And that if people will come and look at
this name,

1344
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,800
then they'll be immune to the snake's 
poison.

1345
01:08:01,801 --> 01:08:04,120
Or the snakes will stop biting them.
I don't remember which.

1346
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:08,200
And it's a lovely story because it's 
another exposure story and sort of means

1347
01:08:08,201 --> 01:08:09,034
that if you're willing to gaze upon the 
thing that is most poisoned to you or 

1348
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:15,430
that you're most afraid of,
that that can help you overcome it.

1349
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,870
And that's sort of like this and second 
patient of,

1350
01:08:17,871 --> 01:08:18,704
except it's more complex because this 
surface pale sort of stretches down 

1351
01:08:22,150 --> 01:08:22,983
anything infinity that representations 
sort of it sort of the manifestation of 

1352
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:29,173
the unknown right from the beginning of 
time and space that's without even to 

1353
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:34,173
represent something that's sort of the 
problem of humanity in some sense is 

1354
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:42,260
that there's an infinite number of 
troubles stemming from a new source.

1355
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:45,830
Remarkable representation.
I think

1356
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:48,403
you heard about near death experiences.
I imagine the old idea that people see 

1357
01:08:52,221 --> 01:08:54,220
the light at the end of the tunnel and 
then you know,

1358
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:56,970
wouldn't make get through the light.
They see all their ancestors there.

1359
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,420
Something that vaguely resembles God and
you know,

1360
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,360
and that's conditioned for some group by
their cultural background.

1361
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:05,870
It's a very common experience.
And this is actually a representation of

1362
01:09:05,871 --> 01:09:08,570
that from the twelfth,
the twelfth to 13th century.

1363
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:12,560
Anything by Hieronymus Bosch and this,
so it seems to be the sort of thing also

1364
01:09:12,561 --> 01:09:17,561
that's characteristic of the traumatic 
experience post reduction to skeleton,

1365
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:20,900
so the showmans dies and then as a 
consequence of that,

1366
01:09:20,901 --> 01:09:21,734
he ends up in the space that's 
characterized by the presence of the 

1367
01:09:24,051 --> 01:09:26,640
ancestral spirits.
Whatever that means and me.

1368
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:31,840
You can think about those as each of you
are embodiments of ancestral spirits,

1369
01:09:32,211 --> 01:09:32,450
right?

1370
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:35,180
Because all the ideas you have,
for example,

1371
01:09:35,181 --> 01:09:36,530
are all.
They're all,

1372
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:38,570
no there,
none of them are your ideas or virtually

1373
01:09:38,571 --> 01:09:39,404
none.
It's almost impossible to have an 

1374
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:41,384
original idea.
All the ideas you have or like the 

1375
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:44,193
ghostly remnants of brilliant 
philosophers are theologians who've 

1376
01:09:46,821 --> 01:09:47,690
lived,
you know,

1377
01:09:47,691 --> 01:09:48,524
hundreds or thousands of years ago in 
your whole head is populated by these 

1378
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:55,130
states and they're sort of embodied 
things because they tell you how to act.

1379
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:55,750
You know,
they're,

1380
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:58,430
they're not just cold dead ideas and you
know,

1381
01:09:58,431 --> 01:09:59,510
you're,
you're,

1382
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:00,523
you're a mixture of all those things.
And I don't know if they ancestral 

1383
01:10:03,921 --> 01:10:04,754
spirits that these visionaries encounter
are like personified representations of 

1384
01:10:09,231 --> 01:10:11,540
the spirits that live inside their head 
or what they are.

1385
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:14,240
But,
but part of the experience seems to be,

1386
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,280
um,
what would you call it?

1387
01:10:16,281 --> 01:10:18,980
It's like a rescue and the dying father 
from the,

1388
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:19,940
from the depths.

1389
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,410
I'm.
Many of you seen Pinocchio,

1390
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:23,091
right?
So,

1391
01:10:23,091 --> 01:10:25,170
you know,
the fundamental theme there right now,

1392
01:10:25,171 --> 01:10:29,600
don't use a marionette so anyone can 
manipulate him and he's wouldn't head.

1393
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:31,310
He's not awake,
he's not conscious.

1394
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:32,144
He's not alive.
And so he can be led astray in 15 

1395
01:10:34,431 --> 01:10:35,264
different ways and you know,
finally his father disappears to go 

1396
01:10:38,121 --> 01:10:41,150
looking for them and for,
for reasons that aren't exactly clear as

1397
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,730
father ends up being inside a whale that
to bottom of the ocean,

1398
01:10:43,731 --> 01:10:44,760
which is,
you know,

1399
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,150
not the first place you think of looking
for your father,

1400
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:49,800
but especially if you're a puppet and 
you.

1401
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:50,663
I like it.
A cricket was leaving which was all 

1402
01:10:52,491 --> 01:10:53,324
observed stuff.
Although one thing I could tell you is 

1403
01:10:56,841 --> 01:10:59,290
what's the cricket snake?
Yeah.

1404
01:10:59,291 --> 01:11:00,560
Yeah.
What's the initials?

1405
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,540
Right.
So fake,

1406
01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:03,321
right?
Yeah.

1407
01:11:03,321 --> 01:11:06,120
Jimminy cricket is sending US Slang for 
Jesus Christ.

1408
01:11:06,121 --> 01:11:08,630
And you know the animators pick that up 
as a joke,

1409
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:11,720
but it's not a joke because of course 
the cricket serves as the conscience and

1410
01:11:11,721 --> 01:11:14,370
the spiritual guide on this,
on this quest vision,

1411
01:11:14,371 --> 01:11:17,880
and it's the cricket that leads the 
pocket deep underground.

1412
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:21,660
You actually attended to the ocean to 
the deepest depths of despair,

1413
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:25,680
right in death,
like a Chabad disintegration to find the

1414
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:27,780
spirit of his father.
And why does he need that?

1415
01:11:27,810 --> 01:11:28,643
Well,
it's because without incorporating the 

1416
01:11:29,941 --> 01:11:33,150
spirit of his father or his forefathers 
can't be real.

1417
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,930
And that's because human beings at 
puppets apparently,

1418
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:39,300
you know,
we're cultural creatures.

1419
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:42,060
It's not like there's you and there's 
your culture.

1420
01:11:42,061 --> 01:11:42,894
It's like you are your culture and so 
you're either the embodiment of your 

1421
01:11:46,561 --> 01:11:47,394
culture fleshed out and made whole or 
you're just a fragmentary thing and 

1422
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:52,950
you're only half alive and worse than 
that,

1423
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,350
you can cope with tragedy.
I mean,

1424
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:58,950
the way that Pinocchio becomes real as 
he rescues his father from the whale,

1425
01:11:59,070 --> 01:12:00,690
which is also a dragon,
right?

1426
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:02,580
The whales that dragon.
How do you know that?

1427
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:06,210
What happens to the whale?
He spits fire.

1428
01:12:06,211 --> 01:12:07,830
Yeah,
that's weird behavior for a whale.

1429
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:10,490
That's Pinocchio.
Lights a fire inside of,

1430
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:14,340
but of course you know that's how human 
beings have always escaped from chaos is

1431
01:12:14,341 --> 01:12:15,174
by using fire.
So he's the master of fire and that 

1432
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:20,730
brings them up from the depths and he 
has to rescue his father and it actually

1433
01:12:20,731 --> 01:12:21,451
kills it,
right?

1434
01:12:21,451 --> 01:12:22,281
His father says,
no,

1435
01:12:22,281 --> 01:12:23,280
no,
let me drown.

1436
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:25,480
Save yourself.
Don't give.

1437
01:12:25,481 --> 01:12:26,314
It doesn't.
And he dies in the effort to bring them 

1438
01:12:27,421 --> 01:12:28,730
to shore.
But then the,

1439
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,570
you know,
the blue fairy comes down and says,

1440
01:12:30,571 --> 01:12:32,660
well,
because you're such a good puppet,

1441
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,640
now you're awake.
You know,

1442
01:12:35,641 --> 01:12:36,474
it's a,
it's a,

1443
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,730
it's a remarkable story.
It's an amazing movie.

1444
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:40,020
I mean,
it's a,

1445
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,230
it has themes in it.
There's thousands and thousands of years

1446
01:12:43,231 --> 01:12:44,064
old,
like the idea that the hero has to 

1447
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:48,060
journey to the,
to the darkest depths,

1448
01:12:48,061 --> 01:12:50,310
to,
to reclaim a treasure.

1449
01:12:50,311 --> 01:12:51,550
The treasure can be lots of things.

1450
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:53,520
That can be the dead father.
It can be a princess,

1451
01:12:53,521 --> 01:12:55,440
it can be gold.
It doesn't really matter.

1452
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:56,483
There's this idea that you know,
the thing you want most is to be found 

1453
01:12:59,161 --> 01:13:01,980
where you least want to look just a 
lovely little.

1454
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:04,530
That's a.
that's no chemical dictum by the way,

1455
01:13:04,531 --> 01:13:07,520
that the sort of reanimated buddy.
So anyway,

1456
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:10,780
that's the idea in the show conditions 
is that past death.

1457
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,190
There's this opening up into the 
ancestral landscape and that's the place

1458
01:13:14,191 --> 01:13:18,930
where you can commune with while the 
ancestor gods or maybe the spirit of the

1459
01:13:18,931 --> 01:13:22,140
ancestors themselves,
which is something like God.

1460
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:23,303
You know,
if you look at the Christian 

1461
01:13:24,121 --> 01:13:25,650
representations,
for example,

1462
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:28,350
one of the elements of God is God the 
father.

1463
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:29,473
And so God the father is sort of like an
amalgam of all the great fathers of the 

1464
01:13:33,031 --> 01:13:34,410
past.
You know,

1465
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,370
because you might say,
well,

1466
01:13:35,371 --> 01:13:37,890
what makes person a person a great 
father?

1467
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:39,810
Well,
careful,

1468
01:13:39,811 --> 01:13:42,080
devoted attention would be part of it,
right?

1469
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,193
That's a transpersonal thing.
It's like if you're a great father and 

1470
01:13:45,661 --> 01:13:46,494
you are too,
there's something about both of your 

1471
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:51,060
actions as a great father that are the 
same.

1472
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,570
And you can think of that as the spirit 
of the great father and you know,

1473
01:13:54,571 --> 01:13:55,404
that sort of shines through individuals.
And so that's a way of communing with 

1474
01:13:58,621 --> 01:14:02,880
God through the ancestors and that's 
part of what these rituals are about.

1475
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:09,180
I would like even now to stress the fact
that the psychopathology of the romantic

1476
01:14:09,181 --> 01:14:10,014
vocation is not profane,
it not belong to ordinary 

1477
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,114
symptomatology.
It has an initiatory structure and 

1478
01:14:15,431 --> 01:14:16,264
signification in short,
every produces a traditional mystical 

1479
01:14:18,941 --> 01:14:19,774
pattern.
The total crisis of the future Sharma 

1480
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,210
sometimes leading to complete 
disintegration of the personality and to

1481
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:29,050
madness can be evaluated not only as an 
initiatory death,

1482
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,153
but also as a symbolic return to the pre
cosmo mechanic chaos to be a morphous 

1483
01:14:34,051 --> 01:14:37,090
and indescribable state that precedes 
any cosmogony.

1484
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:38,770
Well,
that's a mouthful.

1485
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:41,890
So one of the things I mentioned about 
this,

1486
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:46,800
there's some
suggestion on the part of the artists.

1487
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:51,920
This is a monster of origin point.
That's like the beginning of time.

1488
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:58,240
It's a symbol of the infinity that 
stretches on the fourth and that emerges

1489
01:14:59,131 --> 01:15:04,000
from that.
And so part of the initiatory process is

1490
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:05,870
the dissolution of the personality.

1491
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,270
The question is,
well,

1492
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:08,283
what state of existence exists at the 
level where your personality dissolved 

1493
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:13,803
because you're.
You see the world through your 

1494
01:15:15,251 --> 01:15:18,100
personality and the world has given,
formed through your personality and then

1495
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:20,530
when it starts to dissolve and 
disintegrate,

1496
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:21,513
say when you sink into depression,
said you're sinking into a state that 

1497
01:15:25,061 --> 01:15:25,894
sort of before consciousness itself.
So let me tell you something that 

1498
01:15:29,501 --> 01:15:34,501
William James said about this.
So it's very difficult thing to get to,

1499
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:36,383
to communicate and we'll,
we'll touch on it a bit more when we 

1500
01:15:38,891 --> 01:15:43,390
moved into constructivism.
So part of the idea here is that you,

1501
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:44,463
that reality itself is extracted from 
the unknown and the unknowable and you 

1502
01:15:48,071 --> 01:15:48,904
know,
you do that as individuals because 

1503
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:53,680
there's all the parts of the world that 
you understand and then there's parts of

1504
01:15:53,681 --> 01:15:56,530
the world that you don't understand.
You can't even conceive of now.

1505
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:58,630
And then you encounter them,
especially when you fail.

1506
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:02,920
And then you interact with them.
And by doing that you make them real and

1507
01:16:02,921 --> 01:16:03,754
describable and experienceable.
And so it's like there's this late 

1508
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:07,503
possibility that surrounds existence 
that you can interact with and pull up 

1509
01:16:11,081 --> 01:16:11,914
into actuality and that sort of the.
That's like the action of consciousness 

1510
01:16:14,981 --> 01:16:16,660
on reality.
That's why,

1511
01:16:16,661 --> 01:16:20,260
by the way,
in the beginning of Genesis Genesis,

1512
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:23,140
it's the word of God that produces order
from chaos.

1513
01:16:23,141 --> 01:16:24,580
Right?
And so that's the initiative.

1514
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:28,750
That's the initiation of a reality.
And then later in Genesis,

1515
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:29,584
God makes human beings and he says,
you're made both of you in the image of 

1516
01:16:32,381 --> 01:16:33,940
God.
And the question is,

1517
01:16:33,941 --> 01:16:34,960
well,
what does that mean?

1518
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:36,790
Well,
it might mean that God has two arms,

1519
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:37,713
two legs,
but what it seems to mean more 

1520
01:16:38,981 --> 01:16:39,814
accurately is that whatever it is that 
makes you conscious has this divine 

1521
01:16:43,841 --> 01:16:48,580
quality and it's capable of extracting 
order continually from payoffs.

1522
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:51,820
And by doing that,
by being conscious actors in the world,

1523
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,490
you're bringing about the creation of 
reality.

1524
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,380
And that's a remarkable thing.
And you know,

1525
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:57,370
there's,
there's nothing,

1526
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:58,413
there's nothing mystical about that you 
know perfectly well that you can make 

1527
01:17:01,391 --> 01:17:03,670
tomorrow one thing or another,
you know,

1528
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:05,370
and is that freewill?
Well,

1529
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:06,204
who,
who knows that question will never be 

1530
01:17:07,121 --> 01:17:09,460
solved,
but it certainly seems phenomenal,

1531
01:17:09,461 --> 01:17:10,294
logically like there's an option here 
for you and there's an option here for 

1532
01:17:13,491 --> 01:17:17,390
you and there's an option here for you.
Those are all potential and you can just

1533
01:17:17,391 --> 01:17:18,224
choose which one of those you want to 
head towards and make actual and that's 

1534
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:24,080
consciousness.
Doing that consciousness is something we

1535
01:17:24,081 --> 01:17:27,590
don't have a clue vote and this is 
William James.

1536
01:17:27,591 --> 01:17:30,290
William James is the father of a 
pragmatic philosophy,

1537
01:17:30,291 --> 01:17:31,124
but also with modern psychology.
He did a fair bit of experimentation 

1538
01:17:33,831 --> 01:17:38,690
with nitrous oxide,
which is this sort of inert gas that,

1539
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:40,940
that the dentists use,
for example,

1540
01:17:40,941 --> 01:17:41,774
as an animal analgesic,
but that also has quite profound 

1541
01:17:44,001 --> 01:17:47,840
hallucinatory and mystical experience 
inducing properties.

1542
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,180
And so William James used to play with 
this.

1543
01:17:50,450 --> 01:17:52,400
This is a poem he,
he wrote,

1544
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:53,443
um,
I'll read the description description 

1545
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:57,860
first from William James and then the 
poem he said,

1546
01:17:58,370 --> 01:17:59,203
pure experiences,
the name which I give to the original 

1547
01:18:00,861 --> 01:18:03,320
flux of life before reflection has 
categorized it.

1548
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:06,830
Only newborn Babes and persons in semi 
coma from sleep,

1549
01:18:06,831 --> 01:18:07,670
drugs,
illnesses,

1550
01:18:07,671 --> 01:18:11,690
or blows can have an experience pure in 
the literal sense

1551
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:17,060
of that which is not yet any definite 
what they'll ready to be.

1552
01:18:17,061 --> 01:18:20,690
All sorts of what's full,
both of oneness and of meanness,

1553
01:18:20,691 --> 01:18:23,690
but in respects that don't appear 
changing throughout yet.

1554
01:18:23,691 --> 01:18:24,524
So confusedly that it's phases,
interpenetrate and no points either of 

1555
01:18:27,801 --> 01:18:30,290
distinction or of identity can be 
caught.

1556
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:41,690
Sorry,
I.

1557
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,400
Yeah,
well it's sort of an incoherent,

1558
01:18:53,401 --> 01:18:54,234
but what William James is referring to 
is this idea that what the ground of 

1559
01:18:59,161 --> 01:18:59,994
reality as something like a potential 
from a potential full of many possible 

1560
01:19:04,171 --> 01:19:08,460
actualities from which single 
actualities can be drawn and that that's

1561
01:19:08,461 --> 01:19:10,950
what consciousness is doing would it 
makes decisions and it's.

1562
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:13,310
It's a brilliant idea and I think you 
know,

1563
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,153
and I expect you to take this with a 
grain of salt because I know this part 

1564
01:19:17,581 --> 01:19:20,150
of what I'm telling you about what you 
may think this about.

1565
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,800
A lot of what I'm telling you is sort of
out on the fringes,

1566
01:19:22,801 --> 01:19:23,634
but the quantum mechanics believed that 
the most accurate way to portray the 

1567
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:32,160
ground of reality is as something that 
striving to manifest itself.

1568
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:33,173
It's not there yet.
It has to be interacted with something 

1569
01:19:36,361 --> 01:19:39,510
that's a conscious observer before it 
takes on tangible reality.

1570
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:41,900
And so the ground of being seems to be 
something like,

1571
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:45,930
like a multidimensional potential from 
which many things can emerge.

1572
01:19:45,931 --> 01:19:49,620
And I think I actually think that is 
what we see when we look at the future,

1573
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:52,080
you know,
because what the hell is the future?

1574
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:53,930
What is it?
You know,

1575
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:58,760
we certainly treated it as if it's real.
The future is a place of potential wild,

1576
01:19:58,761 --> 01:19:59,281
right?
Well,

1577
01:19:59,281 --> 01:20:00,990
what does that mean?
Well,

1578
01:20:00,991 --> 01:20:04,940
it means whatever it means is real 
enough so that you orient yourself by it

1579
01:20:04,941 --> 01:20:05,774
and you take the future seriously.
You believe your choice is bringing 

1580
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:08,993
future a,
future b and two being you don't really 

1581
01:20:10,861 --> 01:20:12,570
know the limits of that.
You know,

1582
01:20:12,571 --> 01:20:16,470
like if you really got your act together
right down to the core,

1583
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:17,423
you know,
you have no idea what sort of glorious 

1584
01:20:19,141 --> 01:20:21,720
future you might be able to bring into 
existence.

1585
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:22,470
You know,
it's,

1586
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:23,303
it's an an resolve question.
If you diligently work with all of your 

1587
01:20:27,631 --> 01:20:28,464
effort,
you know,

1588
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:29,413
to perfecting the things around you,
you have no idea how far you might be 

1589
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:33,640
able to go.
You don't want it to.

1590
01:20:33,641 --> 01:20:37,350
It's a real open question and I think 
that's part of what human beings have to

1591
01:20:37,351 --> 01:20:39,780
bring against the sort of horrors of 
existence.

1592
01:20:39,781 --> 01:20:43,590
It's like you have a lot of potential 
and if you made the right choices,

1593
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:47,160
if we're awake and careful,
God only knows what you might be able to

1594
01:20:47,161 --> 01:20:50,200
manage.
So here's this poem.

1595
01:20:50,210 --> 01:20:52,590
He sounds like a sixties hippy from 
Greenwich village,

1596
01:20:52,591 --> 01:20:53,424
really written in like 1890.
No verbiage can give it because the 

1597
01:20:57,511 --> 01:20:58,344
verbiage is either by which he means 
that whatever this potential is exists 

1598
01:21:02,221 --> 01:21:04,850
in a place before articulation,
right?

1599
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:07,170
Once it's articulated,
it's not potential,

1600
01:21:07,171 --> 01:21:08,640
it's all of a sudden something actual.

1601
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:13,440
That's actually why the ancient Jews 
didn't want to use the name of God.

1602
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,860
You weren't allowed to name God because 
as soon as you named God,

1603
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:19,660
he was no longer God.
God was the unnameable.

1604
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:20,800
You know,
in the and the,

1605
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:24,930
and the Muslims have the same sort of 
idea about Mohammed in many ways.

1606
01:21:24,970 --> 01:21:25,803
It's like you don't,
don't want to make out concrete 

1607
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:30,220
representation because then you take the
ideal,

1608
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:31,373
the ideal space,
and you start to make it something that 

1609
01:21:32,911 --> 01:21:35,870
you can like our human construction.
So you know,

1610
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:37,500
it's an idea of this quarter.
It's merit.

1611
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:42,540
No verbiage can give it because the 
verbiage just other incoherent,

1612
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,690
coherent the same and it fades and it's 
infinite.

1613
01:21:46,130 --> 01:21:48,720
It's infinite.
Don't you see the difference?

1614
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:54,050
Don't you see the identity constantly?
Opposites united the same me telling you

1615
01:21:54,631 --> 01:21:58,530
to write a note to write extreme 
something other than that thing.

1616
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:02,010
Intoxication and other.
This intoxication,

1617
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:06,270
every attempted betterment,
every attempted other men.

1618
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:10,620
It is,
it fades forever and forever as we move.

1619
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:12,900
Alright,
let's start there.

1620
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:14,213
Obviously.
