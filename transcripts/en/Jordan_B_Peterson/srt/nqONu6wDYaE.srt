1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,910
This title I didn't really realize I'd
be speaking to an audience that actually

2
00:00:04,911 --> 00:00:07,280
included witches and wizards.
So

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,710
yeah.
Well probably I'll probably meet them in

4
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:14,660
question period.
That'd be my guess.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,670
So can you all hear me?
One of you can hear me.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,140
How's that?
That's better.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,100
Okay.
Alright,

8
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,680
good.
Alright.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,010
So
as you can plainly see,

10
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:33,950
the title of this talk is dragon's
divined parents,

11
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:38,060
heroes in adversaries are complete
cosmology of being

12
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,000
sounds,
dreadfully new age to me,

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,400
but it's not,

14
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,463
um,

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,220
new age.
People are very creative but they can't

16
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:54,790
think critically,
but I can think critically.

17
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,630
So this is a creative
theoretical enterprise,

18
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,260
conjoined with the capacity to tell the
difference between bad ideas and good

19
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:11,980
ideas.
And hopefully what I'm going to talk to

20
00:01:11,981 --> 00:01:15,520
you about are the greatest ideas that
humanity has ever produced.

21
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,010
There are also ideas that we're,
we don't understand well and

22
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,370
who's highest level of formal
development.

23
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,120
We risk forgetting because we're
criticizing things that we,

24
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,810
we invented as a species,
but that we cannot understand rationally

25
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:42,811
and we're predisposed to believe that
ideas that we can't understand

26
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:46,600
rationally have to be wrong.
And sometimes that's true,

27
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:49,090
but sometimes we're just not smart
enough to understand them.

28
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,093
So

29
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,750
I can give you an example of something
that we're not really smart enough to

30
00:01:56,751 --> 00:02:00,170
understand.
We're not really smart enough to

31
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:04,400
understand why people would line up for
four nights for 10 blocks to watch star

32
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:06,760
wars,
you know,

33
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,420
I mean,
they won't do that for a lecture

34
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,820
and they wouldn't pay money.
And so you know,

35
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:19,370
the star wars for example,
is naturally,

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,530
it's naturally interesting and people
just take that for granted.

37
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:30,490
But the fact that people will line up to
engage voluntary voluntarily in a ritual

38
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:36,431
activity of that sort
is a manifestation of something that's

39
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:39,620
very deep in the human psyche that we do
not comprehend.

40
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:44,621
Well.
So I'm going to talk to you about what I

41
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,360
like to think of as the grammar of
belief.

42
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,823
Okay.

43
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,730
I got interested in this.
Back in the mid eighties was driven

44
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:58,731
mostly by an interest in
global that was ideologically

45
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:05,490
motivated and also atrocity warfare was
not so difficult to understand in some

46
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:10,300
sense because you can map it onto animal
territoriality.

47
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,620
But atrocity in the service of videology
is a whole different thing there.

48
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,580
It's certainly clear that,
for example,

49
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:22,390
in World War II,
when the Nazis had to make a choice

50
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:25,720
perhaps between winning the war and
accelerating the rate at which they were

51
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:30,220
killing Jews,
they chose the latter and it's very

52
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:33,730
difficult to understand that using a
model based on animal territory quality.

53
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,840
I started reading about belief systems
widely

54
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,353
in

55
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,650
in political writings and economic
writings and religious writings.

56
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,520
The psychological writings,
anywhere I could find a thread that I

57
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,490
thought was promising.
I read a lot of young.

58
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,670
I read a lot of Freud,
almost all of the great clinical

59
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:59,460
psychologists,
a lot of soldier units and a lot of

60
00:03:59,461 --> 00:04:04,461
George Orwell,
they're all people,

61
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,510
lot of Dostoevsky and niche.
If they're all people who,

62
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,370
as far as I can tell,
have something very original to say

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,540
and
out of that

64
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,640
are you learned to understand why people
need belief,

65
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:26,710
why it's actually inevitable.
Why faith and faith is inevitable.

66
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,190
Faith is inevitable in part because your
knowledge is finite and so you have to

67
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:33,220
take some things for granted or you fall
into an infinite regress

68
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,810
and what maybe constituted the
difference between pathological belief

69
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:42,660
and non pathological belief.
And those are terms by the way,

70
00:04:42,661 --> 00:04:44,370
which I think can be defined
technically,

71
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,120
which is a statement that runs contrary
to the presuppositions,

72
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:52,890
say of moral relativism.
I'm definitely not a moral relativist.

73
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,730
Um,
I think it constitutes A.

74
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,880
I think the motivation for moral
relativism fundamentally is the desire

75
00:04:59,881 --> 00:05:04,380
to abdicate responsibility even though
you can make very strong intellectual

76
00:05:04,381 --> 00:05:07,380
cases for,
for why moral relativism is correct.

77
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,800
The intellectual case and the actual
motivation have nothing to do with one

78
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:13,670
another.
However,

79
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,400
I've also found out something else which
is quite interesting and I don't know

80
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:24,870
how much I can touch on it tonight,
but I don't think that Newton and Darwin

81
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:25,790
are commensurate.

82
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,530
I think that most modern people are
newtonians not Darwinians.

83
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,660
And I think that you can understand the
grammar of belief,

84
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:39,500
which is religious in nature using
Darwinian principles,

85
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,450
but it means that you have to give up
your Newtonian presuppositions.

86
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:49,630
And so I think I can make that argument
implicitly with what I'm doing as I

87
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:51,980
progressed tonight.
So the first thing I'm going to tell you

88
00:05:51,981 --> 00:05:56,810
is that it's necessary for you to look
at the world through a limited frame of

89
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,290
on.
The reason for that is you're not very

90
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,890
smart.
Your consciousness can only handle about

91
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:08,270
four bits of information per second.
It's not very much given that the number

92
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:12,170
of bits of information coming at you
from next year and world are for all

93
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,630
practical purposes,
infinite.

94
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,240
You're like eldest Huxley suggested your
brain seemed to be primarily a reducing

95
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:23,390
agent.
Your body's a reducing agent as well

96
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:26,480
because there are lots of things that
you just can't detect and then the room

97
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:29,450
that you're sitting in is a reducing
agent because it's keeping all sorts of

98
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:31,460
things out that you would otherwise have
to deal with.

99
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:34,550
And the stability of this city as a
reducing agent.

100
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:38,780
Because we're not going to be stampeded
by barbarians with any luck at every

101
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:41,170
moment or any moment.
We.

102
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,890
We deal with the complexity of the world
in part by inhabiting a sequence of

103
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:50,891
reducing structures until the world is
reduced enough so that we can actually

104
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,030
deal with the minute elements of it that
we can comprehend at any one moment and

105
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:57,740
those elements we comprehend

106
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,560
are not the familiar objects of
objective reality.

107
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,710
In fact,
animals and people included are much

108
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:12,711
interested in objective reality.
We're interested in pragmatic reality

109
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,720
and pragmatic reality is the reality
that you act on,

110
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,380
not that you perceive and because we're
embedded in bodies and because we are

111
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:28,090
biological organisms and because we're
concerned with survival and reproduction

112
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,810
among other things,
how to act is a much more important,

113
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,850
much more important question for us then
what is the world constituted of

114
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,490
how to act in some senses?
Also the Prime Darwinian question,

115
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,290
right?
Because if you act

116
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,210
wrongly from a Darwinian perspective,
you end up dead before you can

117
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:55,211
reproduce.
So darwinism is a pragmatic

118
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,860
theory.
In fact,

119
00:07:59,861 --> 00:08:04,861
the has eat the American pragmatists on
the North American east coast recognize

120
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:10,490
that
very short period of time after Darwin

121
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:13,420
studies were published.
They recognize the connection between

122
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:18,690
pragmatism as a theory and Darwinian
theory instantaneously,

123
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,160
so the world that we inhabit,
given that we're alive and given what's

124
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,770
selected,
selected us to act is actually a

125
00:08:29,771 --> 00:08:34,210
pragmatic world,
and the objects of pragmatic worlds

126
00:08:34,211 --> 00:08:38,950
aren't objects.
There are tools and obstacles and they

127
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,890
have valence,
a priority there.

128
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,650
They have value,
a priority from the Newtonian

129
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:46,090
perspective.
You look at the world

130
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,410
and then you think about the world that
you see the objects of the world that

131
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:53,420
you see and then you evaluate them and
then you act,

132
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:57,270
and that is not how your brain,
it's just wrong.

133
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,820
You might see the value of things before
you see the object itself.

134
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,800
I mean there are people,
for example,

135
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:06,810
who are blind.
They have blind sight.

136
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,330
They can recognize emotions on faces
without knowing.

137
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:13,860
They can see,
so that's partly because their retinas

138
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:17,760
are attached to the Amygdala.
Your retina is attached to a lot of your

139
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:20,010
body,
not just your visual cortex.

140
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:22,800
It's attached to your spinal cord.
It's attached to your nervous system at

141
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:26,610
multiple levels of analysis
simultaneously and so you can use your

142
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:31,611
eyes to detect things that you don't
know you're seeing so and what is in

143
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,200
some sense,
what you often detect under those

144
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:38,280
circumstances is valence value,
so you're very good.

145
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:43,281
For example,
at detecting teeth and predatory eyes

146
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,530
and the reasons for that are self
evident.

147
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,393
Fundamentally,

148
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,320
this is the smallest unit of meaning
that makes up a referential frame.

149
00:09:55,321 --> 00:10:00,321
I think it has three elements,
one of which links the mind to the body.

150
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,400
Actually the mind body problem isn't
that difficult to solve if once you take

151
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:08,310
a pragmatic,
once you look at how the brain works

152
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:13,140
from a pragmatic perspective because
then your consciousness is fundamentally

153
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:16,860
something that's grounded in action and
you can understand the transition

154
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:21,480
between consciousness and action as a
sequence of of analysis that are

155
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:24,690
increasingly action oriented.
I'll talk to you about that a little bit

156
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,850
later,
but the basic framework is something

157
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:29,520
like this and you're always looking at
the world through this framework and the

158
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:33,150
framework has as one pole,
where are you are and what you're doing,

159
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,240
where you are now,
so that's quite a.

160
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,870
you're always trying to get from point a
to point b because you're a linear

161
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:44,040
creature and your embodied so you're
moving and so fundamentally what you're

162
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:47,850
looking at the world through is a
sequence of maps and maps tell you how

163
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:51,960
to get to where you want to go and so
the map specifies where you are because

164
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:54,360
obviously you can't get anywhere if you
don't know where you are.

165
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,540
And many people of course are confused
about where they are so they don't get

166
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:02,541
anywhere and you also have to know where
you're going and that's point a and

167
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:04,380
point b and every time you look at the
world,

168
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:08,130
you're looking through a framework that
has those two valued points.

169
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:13,131
Implicit in your cognitive structure and
generally what you think is where you're

170
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:17,280
going is better than where you are.
Because otherwise,

171
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:18,540
why would you go there?
Now,

172
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,570
some people do choose to go to places
that are worse than where they are,

173
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:24,510
but they're a special case.
You probably live with some of them.

174
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,280
Now when you're going from point a to
point B,

175
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,460
fundamentally you have to move.
Now,

176
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:39,120
movement is not abstract.
Movement is what you do with your body,

177
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,700
and so once your abstract representation
transforms itself into action,

178
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,100
you're no longer in the realm of
abstraction.

179
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,100
So in order to get from one place to
another,

180
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:52,680
you have to know where you are and you
have to know where you're going and then

181
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:54,370
you have walk,
fly,

182
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,480
run role.
You have to perform some sort of

183
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:01,990
embodied action to get there and of
course you have conscious control over

184
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:04,750
your voluntary muscular system,
but underneath that you don't really

185
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:06,760
have anything at all right?
You can move your arm,

186
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,770
you have no idea what muscles you're
moving.

187
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,110
So your conscious representation of your
body grounds out basically at voluntary

188
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:19,111
movement of the larger muscle systems.
So now you might ask,

189
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:22,210
well,
what does specify where you're going?

190
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,520
And the answer to that in large part is
biology,

191
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:28,360
but biology in a complex manner,
and this is where higher order morality

192
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:33,361
starts to become a concern.
You share with other animals all the way

193
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:39,091
down the phylogenetic chain,
various forms of of implicit motivation.

194
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,130
And you know you can kind of lump those.
It's arbitrary.

195
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:46,000
I lumped them into self maintenance
motivations and self propagation

196
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:47,030
motivations.
You know,

197
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,360
you can cut that in different ways.
Like I said,

198
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:53,830
it's more conceptual than than based on
say know anatomy.

199
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,860
But it'll do self maintenance.
Well,

200
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,080
you don't want to get too hot.
You don't want to get too cold.

201
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,780
Your hypothalamus deals with that very
old part of the brain.

202
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,150
It's way more important than your
cortex.

203
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,290
You can take the whole cortex off a
female cat and as long as you keep it in

204
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:12,190
a cage and it has its hypothalamus,
it can pretty much behave like a cat

205
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,820
except that it's hyper exploratory,
which is the last thing you'd expect

206
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:17,200
from an animal with no brain.

207
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,610
You can't be too hard,
you can't be too cold.

208
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,910
You got to regulate your water intake.
You have to eat,

209
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,880
you have to deal with the consequences
of eating,

210
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,760
you have to be with other people.
There's a place circuit,

211
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:34,510
a specialized place circuit.
There's a specialized erotic circuit,

212
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,480
there's a specialized circuit for
exploration,

213
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:40,300
which is about half of what the
hypothalamus does by the way.

214
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,010
Um,
and those,

215
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,370
those systems,
they've often been conceptualized as

216
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:47,560
drives,
but they're not really that.

217
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:51,640
They're more like isolated one I'd
personalities.

218
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,170
They're like cyclops.
They want one thing now they're not

219
00:13:56,171 --> 00:14:00,100
stupid,
but they're not very amenable to

220
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:03,040
argument.
So when you're hungry and you're hungry

221
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,680
and you know,
another motivational system might object

222
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:06,940
to that,
but,

223
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,760
and that happens frequently,
which is partly why people are often

224
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:13,160
confused and also why you need a cortex
because you know,

225
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:18,070
you need a cortex to allow the competing
motivational systems to array themselves

226
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,840
properly and harmoniously across time so
that they all get their due instead of

227
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:26,170
fighting like two year olds in a room
because two year olds are basically

228
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:27,550
hypothalamic,
you know,

229
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:29,740
and so there are lots of fun,
but they're not organized and they're

230
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:31,210
not social at all.

231
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,820
So what happens with the motivational
systems,

232
00:14:33,821 --> 00:14:38,821
very deep in your brain is they,
they specify the value of where you are

233
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:41,130
so that one of the values might be,
um,

234
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,280
I'm thirsty,
and then they tune your perception so

235
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:50,080
that things that are associated with the
quenching of thirst are much more likely

236
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:55,081
to be picked up by your system and they
bias your perceptual processing and your

237
00:14:55,711 --> 00:15:00,711
evaluation towards the,
towards improvement of that motivation,

238
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:03,110
lack.
And,

239
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,780
and so you can't really think of them as
drives because they're way more

240
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,850
complicated than that.
They specify where you are.

241
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:10,550
So there's an element of self
consciousness that's associated with

242
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:14,240
that.
I'm thirsty and they specify a target.

243
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,550
Usually using fantasy.
You know,

244
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,600
you get thirsty,
you think,

245
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:18,800
well,
what would I like to drink?

246
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:22,610
And you get little fantasy about maybe a
glass of juice or a bit of water or

247
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:23,330
something like that.

248
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:27,200
And then your nervous system is tuned in
and you walk into the kitchen and you

249
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:31,580
ignore everything that's irrelevant to
the search for liquid.

250
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:35,480
And you focus in on everything that's
relevant to the search for liquid.

251
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:38,570
And that means you're so blind,
you cannot believe it.

252
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,640
I mean,
there's been many experiments now that

253
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:45,200
have shown that you can do things like,
I'm sure some of you have seen this,

254
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,040
you can introduce,
have gorilla into a basketball game and

255
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:52,340
60 or 70 percent of the people watching,
as long as they're paying attention to

256
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:53,660
the ball,
they won't see the gorilla.

257
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,270
And it's not like a little tiny gorilla
that somewhere off in the corner,

258
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:59,930
it's like main center,
six feet high beating its chest.

259
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:03,140
And even when you know that if something
else changes in the background,

260
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:05,570
you won't see that either.
So as far as you guys know,

261
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,950
that carpet could be changing colors 15,
20 times a minute.

262
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:13,400
You wouldn't even notice it unless you
had some weird obsession with carpets.

263
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,730
So,
okay,

264
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:19,970
so that's the beginning.
And in some sense of a universal system

265
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:20,820
of values.
Right?

266
00:16:20,821 --> 00:16:22,520
And I can tell you how universal this
is.

267
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:24,830
I always have to tell this story because
it's so damn funny.

268
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:29,630
I just can't believe it.
So one of the things that your brain is

269
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:32,770
very concerned with his relative status.
That's why you're doing,

270
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,140
by the way,
which is partly why relative poverty is

271
00:16:36,141 --> 00:16:39,470
often such a social problem.
People hate me and low in status,

272
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,520
especially men,
old male status hierarchies a bit

273
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:46,070
different than women and women are
pretty sensitive to status too,

274
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:51,020
but they use different markers anyways.
Part what happens when your status goes

275
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:53,510
up as your brain,
serotonin levels go up and when your

276
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:55,070
brain,
serotonin levels go up,

277
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,960
your last irritable and you and you
experience less negative emotion per

278
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:03,890
unit of uncertainty or threat,
and so when you know when you demean

279
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:08,891
someone and you interfere with and you
lowered the presumed status as far as

280
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:12,350
their very primordial circuit is
concerned,

281
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,760
you alter the system that regulates
their emotions and they hate that.

282
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,260
People hate that more than anything and
it's an unbelievably archaic circuit.

283
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,950
You can kind of tell this because
depressed people basically act like

284
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:29,060
they're low status and depressed.
People are depressed about everything

285
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,670
now.
It's not easy to be depressed about

286
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,080
everything.
Right?

287
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:37,100
And so the fact that that's the case
means that what's ever gone astray has

288
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:41,630
to be very primordial because it affects
everything anyways.

289
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,800
People often use antidepressants to cure
depression,

290
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,580
hence their name.
I'm and antidepressants decrease the

291
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:55,410
rate at which Serotonin is taken back up
by the neurons that produce it.

292
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,990
Well,
300 million years ago,

293
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:06,020
crustaceans emerged and crustaceans live
in dominance hierarchies even though

294
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:10,030
they're not particularly social.
And if one lobster fights with another

295
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:11,880
and gets defeated,
then he won't fight with another

296
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:14,910
lobster.
Even when he beat for 20 minutes less,

297
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,750
you give them antidepressants,
in which case he'll fight again right

298
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,970
away.
The reason I'm telling you this is

299
00:18:20,971 --> 00:18:25,971
because the status structure that
underlies your being not just your

300
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:31,890
brain,
but your being is is so old.

301
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:36,690
You share it with crustaceans,
so you mess with it at your peril.

302
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,940
It's not learned by no means.

303
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,320
So anyways,
you wander around inside one of these

304
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:49,320
little frames going from point a to
point b all the time.

305
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:50,850
And one of the annoying things about
life,

306
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:54,240
and this is sort of this is a story,
is that as soon as you climb from point

307
00:18:54,241 --> 00:18:57,780
a to point b and you get there,
then there's another point and another

308
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,810
point b.
and that's pretty interesting too,

309
00:19:00,811 --> 00:19:04,950
because one of the things that suggest
is that getting somewhere isn't really

310
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:07,020
what people want because as soon as you
get somewhere,

311
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,600
then you're done going there and then
you have to get somewhere else.

312
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:12,440
So in some sense it seems it's an
accomplishment,

313
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,050
another sense.
It's just the next rock up the mountain.

314
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:18,960
Now you all know this because you know,
you graduated from university and that

315
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:21,120
was a good day,
but the next day you weren't a

316
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:23,100
university student,
you were some unemployed,

317
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:24,450
loser,
you know.

318
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,540
And so,
and that's uh,

319
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,600
you know,
that sets up a whole new set of

320
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:28,381
problems,
right?

321
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:31,260
I mean,
that's how the frame shifts and when the

322
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:33,780
frame shifts like that,
then the value of everything shifts

323
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:38,460
around it.
So it turns out that people are actually

324
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:41,160
more interested in getting from point a
to point b,

325
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:46,161
then they are in actually being at point
b and almost all of the positive emotion

326
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:48,750
that you feel,
which is related to dopaminergic

327
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:53,700
circuitry by the way you experienced in
relationship to the pursuit of a value

328
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,550
goal rather than to the attainment of
the goal.

329
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,430
The attainment of the goal actually
satisfies you,

330
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,580
or more specifically,
it satisfies that motivational circuit,

331
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:06,150
but then the damn thing just shuts off
and another one starts yelling at you,

332
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:11,570
so it's like a perverse form of victory.
So one answer to that.

333
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:15,690
That's universal in some senses that you
should establish a relationship with a

334
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:20,400
transcendent value because it never runs
out of motivational power.

335
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,510
You can see an example of that popular
example in Popular Culture in the

336
00:20:24,511 --> 00:20:25,890
Pinocchio Movie,
which are.

337
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,470
How many of you have seen that?
Yeah.

338
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,040
Is anybody not seen it?
Hm.

339
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,480
That's amazing.
Anyways,

340
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,290
in the Pinocchio Movie,
one of the things that happens is when

341
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:41,400
Japan wishes that his son becomes a full
developed individual instead of a damn

342
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:43,560
puppet,
this is a good thing for a parent to

343
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:48,561
wish by the way he wishes upon a star
and the star something of transcendent

344
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:52,060
value.
And so the meaning of that fundamentally

345
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:54,940
is that if you want to raise your child
to be an independent being,

346
00:20:54,941 --> 00:20:57,460
that you better set your sights on
something transcended or it won't

347
00:20:57,461 --> 00:20:59,020
happen,
and believe me,

348
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:04,050
there's lots of times it doesn't happen.
So part of the utility of a transcendent

349
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:07,660
value is that never loses it's
motivational effectiveness.

350
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:08,530
Now you might say,
well,

351
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:10,420
that's no proof that there are
transcendent values.

352
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,051
It's like,
yeah,

353
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:13,450
that's true.
But there's more to the story.

354
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,220
Okay,
so when you're in one of these little

355
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,290
stories,
which is basically what they are,

356
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:24,970
they're the simplest story.
I was one place I went by this means to

357
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:26,980
another place.
That's the simplest story.

358
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,070
It's not that exciting.
Much more exciting story is I was going

359
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:33,250
from point a to b and something weird
happened and then I didn't know where I

360
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:36,260
was and then I was like in chaos for,
you know,

361
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,280
two years.
And then I figured out how to climb out

362
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:40,690
of it.
Everybody likes that story,

363
00:21:40,691 --> 00:21:43,060
right?
That's a death and rebirth story by the

364
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:46,300
way,
or a fall from paradise story with a

365
00:21:46,301 --> 00:21:48,450
regaining of paradise at the end,
you know,

366
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,860
it's an archetypal story because
everyone lives it.

367
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,240
And so anyways,
when you're in one of these little

368
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,000
stories,
frames of reference,

369
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,950
what you see in front of you are really
things that one of the best scientists,

370
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:07,951
whoever studied visual perception,
called the book's called ecological

371
00:22:09,851 --> 00:22:11,230
approach to visual perception.

372
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,060
He called them affordances.
Affordance is something that affords you

373
00:22:16,061 --> 00:22:18,820
something and affordances can be
positive or negative.

374
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:21,280
I like to think about them as tools or
obstacles.

375
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,700
So for example,
if I need to make a beeline for that

376
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:27,760
door,
you guys are all instantly obstacles.

377
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:32,500
And the way I would respond to that
implicitly is that you'd all be

378
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:34,930
negative.
So imagine we just said fire.

379
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,780
Well you were people the minute before
that,

380
00:22:37,781 --> 00:22:41,800
but the second after that,
your obstacles and your emotional

381
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:44,950
reactions to the people that are in
front of you are going to reflect that.

382
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,440
Now you all know that because you drive,
you know,

383
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:52,441
and once you're encapsulated in your
little insectoid shell and don't have to

384
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,970
deal with the immediate responses of
other people,

385
00:22:54,971 --> 00:22:59,050
you're going to treat them like
obstacles and like demonic obstacles at

386
00:22:59,051 --> 00:23:01,090
the drop of a hat.
And you know,

387
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:03,040
that's pretty much automatic behavior.

388
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,340
So tools are things that get you to
where you want to go.

389
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,300
And you remember,
you know,

390
00:23:07,301 --> 00:23:10,270
human beings are tool using animals par
exsalonce,

391
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:12,340
right?
We're so tool using that.

392
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:15,190
That's what we see.
It's built right into us.

393
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,200
We're always scanning the world for
tools.

394
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:19,120
When you look at gravel,
for example,

395
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:22,600
what you actually see are throwing sized
rocks.

396
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,740
That's why they manifest themselves as
that kind of object in the environment.

397
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:30,220
You know you're built at a certain level
of resolution and the way your nervous

398
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:34,810
system parts parses up the world is into
things that are useful for you and

399
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:37,600
things that aren't.
And those are not objects.

400
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:43,380
The whole idea of object is a very,
very modern derivative of that much more

401
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:47,990
primordial system.
And it's by no means clear at all that

402
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:52,010
our notion of object is more real than
the notion of affordance.

403
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,350
In fact,
as far as your brain is concerned,

404
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,710
objects,
no one cares about objects.

405
00:23:57,711 --> 00:24:00,740
What your brain cares about is
affordances and what your brain is

406
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:04,220
adapted to is the world as a set of
affordances,

407
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:06,800
as obstacles.
And if you're a Darwinian,

408
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,950
it's very difficult to escape the
conclusion that what selected you is

409
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:16,400
reality,
and so if the reality that selected you

410
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:20,780
shaped you so that what you see are
affordances and obstacles or you die,

411
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,970
then it's perfectly real proposition,
perfectly reasonable proposition to

412
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:30,770
state that what reality is in fact is a
set of affordances,

413
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,100
tools and obstacles.
And that is how your brain works.

414
00:24:34,101 --> 00:24:35,570
By the way,
when you look at,

415
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,410
say I look at that projector,
maybe I'm thinking about picking it up.

416
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:43,190
What happens is my eyes activate the
part of my motor cortex that would

417
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:45,380
adjust my hand to grip it like that.

418
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,560
And so part of what I understand as the
projector is grippable object and that's

419
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:54,830
not a secondary derivation.
I don't see the object and then think

420
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,770
this is how I would grip it.
It's like that would take forever.

421
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,410
You know,
you'd never catch a baseball if that's

422
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:01,700
what you were doing.
It's like,

423
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,640
oh,
a round object is punk.

424
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:04,640
You know?
It's like,

425
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,760
that's just not gonna work.
You're really,

426
00:25:06,761 --> 00:25:08,390
your,
your nervous system is nowhere fast

427
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:12,560
enough to do that consciously.
You're using reptile circuitry to catch

428
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,890
baseball's the mammalian stuff is too
damn slow.

429
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,250
So you catch the ball often.
Especially if someone pitches it fast

430
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:22,380
before you could even see it.
You just think you saw it.

431
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,540
You see it after you caught it.
The case with tennis players too,

432
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,850
they went,
they seem to do is judge where the

433
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:31,880
ball's going to go by the angle of the
racket because if they wait until the

434
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:35,540
ball is off the racket,
they can't move fast enough to hit it

435
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:36,374
back.

436
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,790
They don't have the reflexes for it.
So they can't move the neural messages

437
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:43,250
fast enough to do it.
Okay.

438
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:47,990
So basically the world lays itself out
as tools and obstacles and you know,

439
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:52,040
obstacles make you feel bad.
But like let's say I'm looking at this

440
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:54,080
room and I'm thinking of you guys as
obstacles.

441
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,330
You might say,
well how bad does that make me feel?

442
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,860
And the answer to that is,
well,

443
00:25:57,861 --> 00:25:59,600
not very bad because all I have to do
is,

444
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,700
you know,
make a circuitous route and I can get to

445
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:05,210
the door.
So then the fact that your obstacles is

446
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:08,570
a very minor impediment to the execution
of my plant,

447
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,810
and as a consequence,
it will produce a correspondingly low

448
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:16,760
level of negative emotion.
So you can think of those of known

449
00:26:16,761 --> 00:26:20,900
unknowns in Rumsfeld's terms.
No one unknowns aren't that big a

450
00:26:20,901 --> 00:26:24,020
problem because you can plan for them
and you might have a plan that's an

451
00:26:24,021 --> 00:26:27,560
alternative plant that you can put in
place in case they show up.

452
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:32,510
What people really don't like.
Our unknown unknowns and unknown

453
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:34,910
unknowns.
You don't walk around those man,

454
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:38,150
they blow your whole map and your maps
quite complicated.

455
00:26:38,151 --> 00:26:41,810
It's actually hierarchical in structure.
And I'll get to that because you know,

456
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:45,810
you go from point a to point B so that
you can go to a bigger point,

457
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:47,160
a to point b,
you know,

458
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,770
you crossed the road to get to the
library,

459
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:51,570
to study for an exam,
to pass the exam,

460
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:52,950
to get your degree,
to get a job,

461
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:54,420
to be a person,
to be a citizen,

462
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:56,250
to be a,
to have a good life.

463
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,000
So then if someone gets in your way
while you're crossing the road,

464
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:02,940
then to some degree they're interfering
with you getting a good life.

465
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,170
Now,
not very much,

466
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:08,070
but sometimes you'll react like that.
That certainly happens when you're

467
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,900
dealing with an intimate partner,
you know,

468
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:14,040
because they'll make some little mistake
and you'll say you always do that.

469
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,290
You're always,
you've always done that.

470
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:18,480
You always do it and you're always going
to do it,

471
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,390
which is really not a good way to
conduct an argument.

472
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,370
So unknown unknowns.
Well,

473
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,230
unknown,
unknown unknowns,

474
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:32,550
leap at you from places that you
wouldn't expect because otherwise you

475
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:35,550
would have planned for the damn things.
So there are the things that are always

476
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,910
poking their beak off at you when you
least expect it.

477
00:27:38,911 --> 00:27:41,430
They're just like,
say serpents in the garden of Eden.

478
00:27:41,431 --> 00:27:42,930
That might be one way of thinking about
it.

479
00:27:42,931 --> 00:27:46,740
You can't keep the damn snakes out of
the garden and that's because you can't

480
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:49,920
make a bounded area and keep the
complexity out of it.

481
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,000
The complexity always sneaks back in.
Try protecting your children from the

482
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:55,680
Internet.
For example.

483
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,490
You can't make a bounded circumstance
and get rid of all the complexity.

484
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,480
It always comes sneaking back in.
So what would be an unknown?

485
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:04,650
Unknown.
This is a good one.

486
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:06,840
Here.
You have an intimate relationship.

487
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,660
You've had it for 10 years.
You Trust your partner,

488
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,450
so what does that mean?
You know where you are,

489
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,430
you know who you are and you have a
pretty good idea of who of where you're

490
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:21,680
going and then one day you find out that
your partner has been cheating on you.

491
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:26,010
Not with one person but with three
people and for the whole 10 years.

492
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,520
Well hypothetically,
that comes as a shock.

493
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:34,620
Although you may have ignored many
intimations that such might be the case

494
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,710
irrelevant.
Let's say it comes as a shock.

495
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,970
Well,
what happens to you?

496
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,630
Well,
you don't know where you are.

497
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:46,540
You don't know where you've been.
That's interesting gay because you think

498
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,060
you know where you've been because
you've already been there,

499
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:53,740
but all of a sudden something can happen
so that you are so flipped over that you

500
00:28:53,741 --> 00:28:57,070
don't even know where you were.
So that means in some sense,

501
00:28:57,071 --> 00:29:01,750
the past is dependent on the present,
a very peculiar thing.

502
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,790
You also have no idea where you're going

503
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:10,690
in terms of not knowing where you are.
That's Deep Bay because you might think,

504
00:29:10,691 --> 00:29:12,970
well,
I thought it was in a marriage that

505
00:29:12,971 --> 00:29:16,150
turns out to be wrong.
I thought I knew who my wife or husband

506
00:29:16,151 --> 00:29:21,151
was that turns out to be wrong.
I concluded on the basis that I knew my

507
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,220
wife,
that I knew something about women that

508
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:27,760
turned out to be wrong.
I thought I was in a relationship with

509
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:31,840
someone I could trust that is wrong.
I don't know enough about trust.

510
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:36,070
I'm obviously too gullible.
And so what that does is throw virtually

511
00:29:36,071 --> 00:29:39,010
everything that's ever happened to me in
severe doubt.

512
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,380
Right?
That's the emergence of chaos.

513
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,480
And that's

514
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:48,970
yes,
sometimes you're going from point a to

515
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:52,900
point b and something you don't expect
manifests itself in the middle of your

516
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:55,120
plan.
But it's not such a catastrophe because

517
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:59,440
you can just work around it.
And then sometimes something pops up and

518
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:01,960
like you just do not have a plan
anymore.

519
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,590
And so then you might ask yourself just
exactly where you are,

520
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:10,591
you when you don't know where you are,
and I would say that's a place and it's

521
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:14,560
actually a place that's well documented
in plastic,

522
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:17,590
religious and mythological stories.
That's chaos.

523
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,090
The Dallas,
for example,

524
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:22,780
they believe that the world is made out
of chaos and order order.

525
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:25,540
That's where you are.
When what you do gets you what you want,

526
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,900
chaos.
That's where you are.

527
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:31,720
When you have no idea what's going on
and you might ask,

528
00:30:31,721 --> 00:30:34,000
well,
is there a way that you should act when

529
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:34,930
you're in chaos?

530
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:39,100
And the answer to that is there better
be because it's a place you're going to

531
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:43,300
visit several times during your life and
everyone visits that.

532
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:47,590
That's why it's an archetypal story.
That's the dissent to the underground.

533
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:51,970
Underground is that horrible place that
lurks underneath all of our

534
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:56,530
presuppositions.
It's the frigid lake underneath the thin

535
00:30:56,531 --> 00:31:00,430
ice that everybody's skating on and it's
something that can manifest itself at

536
00:31:00,431 --> 00:31:03,310
any moment.
That's partly why in the Dallas

537
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,410
Assemble,
the Black Paisley is chaos by the way,

538
00:31:05,411 --> 00:31:09,070
and the White Paisley is ordered in the
order Paisley.

539
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,900
There's a little black dot.
Well,

540
00:31:10,901 --> 00:31:14,440
that's because order can turn into chaos
and does at any moment,

541
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,080
and the reverse is also true chaos.
Paternity to order at any moment and

542
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:22,300
insight will do that for you.
You know,

543
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,850
alcoholics report that when they hit
bottom,

544
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:27,610
it's like there's a capella system.
They look at the world in a different

545
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:28,390
way.

546
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:31,750
You know now there are a new person,
they're back from the underground.

547
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,600
They've risen from the dead,
so to speak.

548
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,970
You know,
and it's partly because what looks like

549
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:41,230
your right hemisphere is pretty good at
inferring patterns in,

550
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,930
in,
in novel and chaotic places.

551
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:46,810
It's kind of keeping track of things
that happened to you that are anomalous

552
00:31:46,811 --> 00:31:51,370
and it makes alternative maps of the
world that are there for you to rely on,

553
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,160
at least to some degree if that ever
becomes necessary.

554
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,230
Or you might ask yourself,
how upset should you be when something

555
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:00,940
that you don't expect happens?
Now?

556
00:32:00,941 --> 00:32:04,420
It turns out that that is really a
difficult question to answer because

557
00:32:04,421 --> 00:32:08,020
what the problem is is that when
something you don't expect happens,

558
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,690
you don't know what it is,
and so then he might say,

559
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:12,400
well,
how upset should you get an answer to

560
00:32:12,401 --> 00:32:15,610
that is
you don't know,

561
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,210
and so what happens is,
first of all,

562
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,550
you're.
You've got some built in approximators.

563
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,320
One would be your

564
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,510
genetically determined level of
neuroticism,

565
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,790
which is basically sensitivity to
negative emotion.

566
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,190
If you're more sensitive to negative
emotion,

567
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:37,990
you're going to manifest more
psychophysiological preparation per unit

568
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:41,090
of threat or uncertainty,
which is to say some people get more

569
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:43,820
upset about the same thing.
Then other people do.

570
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,880
Now who's right?
Well who knows?

571
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,400
You wake up in the morning and there's a
little ache in your side.

572
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:49,941
It's like,
well,

573
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:53,450
what is that is sore muscle or cancer?
You don't know,

574
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:57,110
and if you're hypochondriacal well,
it's going to be cancer and sometimes

575
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,920
the hypochondriac is right,
and so he's the one that lives when he

576
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:04,010
goes to the emergency room and finds out
exactly what's going on.

577
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,830
So it's an unanswerable question.
Now,

578
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:09,770
the other way that your brain determines
how upset you should be is by

579
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:13,310
calculating your position in the
dominance hierarchy because the higher

580
00:33:13,311 --> 00:33:16,010
you are in the dominance hierarchy,
the more resources you have at your

581
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:18,680
disposal,
and so the less upset you have to get

582
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:20,770
with anything horrible happen,
so if you're bad,

583
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,480
you're barely clinging to the bottom of
the social structure.

584
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,440
You can be sure that your brain is going
to estimate any anomalous occurrence as

585
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:30,290
a catastrophe,
which is why people don't like being at

586
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:33,500
the bottom of the dominance hierarchy
and it's also why people who were there

587
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:38,501
die a lot sooner and they do.
They die a lot sooner regardless of

588
00:33:39,441 --> 00:33:44,240
their absolute level of wealth.
It's relative deprivation that counts.

589
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,940
Okay,
so here's a bit of a clue about how else

590
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,730
your brain might calculate how upset you
should be.

591
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,620
Here's a little map of me when I'm doing
something that I frequently do,

592
00:33:54,621 --> 00:33:56,660
which is to write a manuscript.
So you might say,

593
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,370
well,
what are you doing when you're writing a

594
00:33:58,371 --> 00:34:00,440
manuscript?
And that turns out to be a very

595
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:01,970
complicated question.
It's like,

596
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,310
what are you doing when you read it?
Read a book.

597
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:05,523
Well,

598
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:11,450
you're writing letters or typing them.
You're typing words and phrases.

599
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,090
You typing sentences,
you're typing paragraphs,

600
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,120
you're typing the structure that the
paragraphs fit into.

601
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:19,670
That would be the essay.
Okay.

602
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:23,820
Then you're
me.

603
00:34:23,821 --> 00:34:26,130
Anyways,
I'm practicing science because I usually

604
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:30,270
write scientific manuscripts and that's
part of embodying my pref professorial

605
00:34:30,271 --> 00:34:33,690
role and then that's part of
hypothetically being a productive

606
00:34:33,691 --> 00:34:36,240
citizen,
although some of you might differ with

607
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,610
that,
given that I'm a professor and then

608
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,510
perhaps on outside of that or this is
what I think is on outside of that is

609
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:45,870
I'm confronting the unknown and you
might say,

610
00:34:45,871 --> 00:34:46,704
well,

611
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,480
what are you really doing when you're
writing a sentence and the answer to

612
00:34:50,481 --> 00:34:53,390
that is you're doing all of these things
better or worse and if you're doing a

613
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:56,600
really good job of writing a sentence,
you're doing all of them at once and

614
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:58,910
that would be one of the things that
would make the sentence particularly

615
00:34:58,911 --> 00:35:00,410
meaningful.
Now,

616
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,260
if something anomalous occurs,
well,

617
00:35:03,261 --> 00:35:06,110
let's say the tee on my typewriter gets
stuck,

618
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:09,620
well that's gonna irritate me because
then I can't type a sentence now,

619
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:11,800
it's not going to irritate me too much
because you know,

620
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:15,200
it doesn't really interfere with my
ability to be a productive citizen.

621
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:20,980
So I'm going to estimate the magnitude
of how upset I should be when something

622
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,520
unknown occurs by estimating where in
the hierarchy of action that normally is

623
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,220
disruptive.
Okay,

624
00:35:31,221 --> 00:35:32,870
so let,
let me run you through this again.

625
00:35:32,871 --> 00:35:37,410
So let's say
what's a good person and you might think

626
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:42,210
of that from an objective perspective,
but that would be a mistake because our

627
00:35:42,211 --> 00:35:47,211
quality like good is a pragmatic quality
and it's based on action not on object.

628
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,640
So here's how you decompose being a good
person.

629
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,103
So

630
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,750
a good person is a good parent.
More than that,

631
00:35:56,751 --> 00:36:00,410
that's a subcomponent right?
And good parent is someone who has a job

632
00:36:00,411 --> 00:36:03,500
and takes care of their family and then
the person who takes care of their

633
00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:06,440
family is like,
they can play with the baby or they can

634
00:36:06,441 --> 00:36:08,960
complete a meal.
These are abstract concepts.

635
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:12,440
You can't tell a four year old make a
meal and the reason you can't,

636
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:15,110
just because they don't know the
subordinate components of making a meal,

637
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,690
you can say,
see that fork.

638
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,260
Hopefully they know what a fork is.
See that fork?

639
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:24,430
Yes,
pick up that work and bring that forth

640
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,370
to the table and put it there.
They can do that because their nervous

641
00:36:28,371 --> 00:36:31,730
system is organized enough to operate at
that level of abstraction,

642
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,550
but they can't do something like make a
meal,

643
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,661
which is,
you know,

644
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:37,820
if you've got a three year old,
you can't put them in their room and you

645
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,140
say clean up your room.

646
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,390
He'll just look at you and then when
they come back,

647
00:36:41,391 --> 00:36:44,060
when you come back in half an hour,
they'll look at you again.

648
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,580
You can say,
hey kid,

649
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,890
see that teddy bear?
Yeah,

650
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:53,510
pick up the teddy bear and put it on
that space in the wall and then once you

651
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:57,050
teach the three year old how to do 100
of those things and they got it,

652
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,360
they've got a little motor routines.
You can say,

653
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,420
clean the room.
You can encapsulate that entire set of

654
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:04,460
motor routines within the higher order
concept,

655
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:07,340
so if you're being a good person,
part of that is,

656
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,350
well,
maybe you're making a meal and part of

657
00:37:09,351 --> 00:37:11,810
that would be while you're cutting up
the vegetables,

658
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,560
but then things get interesting because
when you're cutting up the vegetables,

659
00:37:15,561 --> 00:37:19,220
what you're actually doing is gripping
something and moving and then that's no

660
00:37:19,221 --> 00:37:20,780
longer abstract,
right?

661
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:25,190
That's where your conceptual
philosophical presuppositions like be a

662
00:37:25,191 --> 00:37:30,191
good person hit the roof,
hit the hit the level of embodied

663
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:34,250
material reality.
That's the disillusion of the mind into

664
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:36,500
the body.
Now

665
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,750
if someone says to you,
you should cut those vegetables more

666
00:37:41,751 --> 00:37:44,570
thinly,
that might irritate you,

667
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:50,020
but if they say you're a bad parent,
maybe observing the same phenomena,

668
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,780
then you're going to get into a fight
with them and so,

669
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,410
and the reason for that is obviously if
it's just a matter of cutting the

670
00:37:57,411 --> 00:37:58,680
vegetables thinner,
oh,

671
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:02,000
you have to do is make a minor
modification in the hierarchy that

672
00:38:02,001 --> 00:38:03,350
constitutes yourself

673
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,090
representation or really yourself.
It's not just a representation,

674
00:38:08,091 --> 00:38:11,900
but if you're not a good parent,
it's like if that's true,

675
00:38:11,901 --> 00:38:14,750
you've got a lot of.
You got a lot of repair work to do,

676
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:19,490
a lot of your world is fallen apart and
as soon as things fall apart,

677
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,310
which they always do,
you're in chaos and as soon as you're in

678
00:38:22,311 --> 00:38:25,520
chaos,
then your body defaults to emergency

679
00:38:25,521 --> 00:38:28,580
preparation and you're stressed and if
you're stressed long enough then you

680
00:38:28,581 --> 00:38:31,910
die,
and so you don't like that stress.

681
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:35,860
Say when your body gets stressed,
what happens is because it doesn't

682
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:38,200
really know what's going on,
it prepares for everything.

683
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,710
That's the generalized stress response.
Cortisol production does that.

684
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:44,740
Cortisol production is good.
It wakes you up in the morning,

685
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:49,741
but if it's chronic,
you get old like it's so general and

686
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:55,711
it's negative actions that the best way
to conceptualize it's detrimental

687
00:38:55,991 --> 00:38:58,280
longterm effect is that it accelerates
aging,

688
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,050
so it makes you more likely to have
heart disease and cancer and depression

689
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:07,051
and Alzheimer's and
diabetes and obesity.

690
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:11,300
That'll do.
It's enough.

691
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,580
Any of those that are enough to kill
you.

692
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,220
All right,
so there's a hierarchy.

693
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:19,490
That's a hierarchy of values.
The higher the value,

694
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:22,370
the more the less you want to have it
disrupted.

695
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,233
Now

696
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:29,760
was it a psychologist named piaget?
Some of you might know about him.

697
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:38,770
Piaget was very interested in what
happens to value structures and their

698
00:39:39,231 --> 00:39:44,231
hierarchical organization once they have
to apply outside of the confines of a

699
00:39:44,871 --> 00:39:45,704
body.
So.

700
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,310
So here's a way of thinking about it.
Two year olds basically hypothalamic.

701
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,710
That's why there's so much fun.
First they're happy,

702
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,970
they're sad,
then they're hungry,

703
00:39:52,971 --> 00:39:53,970
then they're tired,
you know,

704
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:59,000
they just zipped from one pretty
straightforward and rather are inspiring

705
00:39:59,001 --> 00:40:03,020
motivational state to another and but at
two they can't play.

706
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,400
They can play with by themselves,
but they can't play with other children.

707
00:40:07,401 --> 00:40:11,150
They can't get that until they're three
and they need to get it by the time

708
00:40:11,151 --> 00:40:13,790
they're three because if they don't get
it by the time they're four,

709
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:16,730
they will never get it.
And then you have an antisocial kid

710
00:40:16,731 --> 00:40:20,360
who's going to be an outsider for his
entire life and there isn't anything you

711
00:40:20,361 --> 00:40:21,194
can do about it.

712
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,420
So that has to happen between two and
four.

713
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,660
So what happens at about age three is
that the kid learns how to play a game

714
00:40:26,661 --> 00:40:28,890
with another person and what that game
is,

715
00:40:28,891 --> 00:40:33,260
it's fundamentally the development of
the ability to share a frame of

716
00:40:33,261 --> 00:40:35,450
reference,
which is what you're doing when you play

717
00:40:35,451 --> 00:40:38,300
monopoly.
It's like it's stupid to play monopoly.

718
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:41,300
Obviously,
who cares if you have a whole pile of

719
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,160
counterfeit paper,
right?

720
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:48,290
But doesn't matter because the way your
constituted is that your brain will

721
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:53,291
treat anything you act like constitutes
a valuable goal as if it's a valid

722
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:56,480
framework of reference.
And if it couldn't do that,

723
00:40:56,481 --> 00:41:00,170
a you couldn't abstract and B,
you could not get along with other

724
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:02,420
people.
So you can sit around the table and you

725
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:06,620
can say,
let's pretend that monopoly is a

726
00:41:06,621 --> 00:41:09,740
reasonable facsimile of reality,
which you wouldn't say,

727
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,330
but it's what you mean.

728
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,380
And everybody says yes,
that would be a music.

729
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:19,910
And so then you set your goal,
which is to get all the little hotels

730
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:22,490
and all the money and play with your
emotions.

731
00:41:22,491 --> 00:41:25,610
Go along for the ride.
And what's so interesting about that is

732
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:28,460
you can get everybody into the game and
so one of the things that's really

733
00:41:28,461 --> 00:41:32,300
interesting about people is that we can
establish a shared fictional frame of

734
00:41:32,301 --> 00:41:34,820
reference and it organizes all our
emotions.

735
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:38,210
So they're predictable.
That's also why we can watch movies.

736
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,730
You go to a movie,
you identify the hero,

737
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,030
you figure out what the hero wants,
truth,

738
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:47,000
you're the hero.
And the way that works is you don't look

739
00:41:47,001 --> 00:41:50,990
at the hero and think about what he's
doing and evaluated emotionally and then

740
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:53,840
feel it.
What you do is you specify the hero's

741
00:41:53,841 --> 00:41:58,160
goal and then you map them onto your
body and you read off the emotional

742
00:41:58,161 --> 00:41:59,510
responses of your own body.

743
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:04,310
And that's how you understand the hero.
So it's an embodied,

744
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,670
you're,
you're using your,

745
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:11,030
your embodiment as a computational
device that can run simulations of other

746
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:13,670
consciousnesses.
And it does that with the body.

747
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,040
And we like doing that.
You can go to a movie and you know

748
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:20,840
you're Brad Pitt for an hour and a half.
You know,

749
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:23,060
when you're Brad Pitt doing remarkable
things.

750
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:26,750
And that's also how we understand other
people were very good at that.

751
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:28,760
So anyways,
we have these shared frames of reference

752
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:30,620
like when we were playing monopoly,
okay.

753
00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:34,580
So children at three learn how to play
games and that means they learn how to

754
00:42:34,581 --> 00:42:39,581
organize their own internal motivational
states into a hierarchy that includes

755
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:43,850
the motivational states of other people.
And that means they can play.

756
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,490
And that's what you guys do when you're
out in the world.

757
00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:47,930
Like we're playing a game right now.

758
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,050
We all know the rules.
That's why we can all sit in this room

759
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,240
and play the game without fighting with
each other.

760
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,940
You know,
in the room is set up like a theater and

761
00:42:55,941 --> 00:43:00,290
we all know the theater game and so.
And the chairs are always facing this

762
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:02,270
way at the moment.
And so that's a hint that you should

763
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,690
look forward and this is raised so you
know,

764
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:08,840
the room is basically telling you what
to do because it's a stage like all

765
00:43:08,841 --> 00:43:11,240
rooms.
And because you're smart and socially

766
00:43:11,241 --> 00:43:13,340
conscious,
you can walk into a stage,

767
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:17,300
grew and your body knows what to do and
if you're civilized in social,

768
00:43:17,301 --> 00:43:19,730
you just do it.
Then all the other primates can predict

769
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:21,950
what you're up to and they won't kill
you.

770
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,700
Yeah,
well that's what it means to be part of

771
00:43:25,701 --> 00:43:28,670
the same tribe.
You know when people are very peculiar

772
00:43:28,671 --> 00:43:30,830
creatures and God only knows what
they're up to,

773
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,440
but as long as they're playing the same
game you are.

774
00:43:33,441 --> 00:43:36,170
You don't have to know what they're up
to because you can predict what they're

775
00:43:36,171 --> 00:43:41,000
going to do and you understand their
motivational states and so part of the

776
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:43,250
building and constructing of higher
order motive,

777
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:48,490
higher order moral goals,
is the establishment of joint frames of

778
00:43:50,691 --> 00:43:54,710
reference that allow multiple people to
pursue the goals that they're interested

779
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:58,010
in simultaneously.
And then what you have to think about

780
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:02,300
with regards to that is that not all
shared frames of reference can manage

781
00:44:02,301 --> 00:44:04,940
that.
There's a small subset of them that are

782
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:08,570
optimized so that not only can multiple
people play them,

783
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:11,690
but multiple people can play them and
enjoy them.

784
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:15,200
And do it repeatedly across a long
period of time,

785
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:19,970
so it's integratability that partly
defines the utility of a higher order

786
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,850
moral structure and that is not
arbitrary.

787
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,050
It's an emergent property of biological
interactions and you might say,

788
00:44:27,051 --> 00:44:29,090
well,
it's kind of arbitrary because people

789
00:44:29,091 --> 00:44:32,040
can do what they want,
but it's not arbitrary at all because a

790
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:36,690
lot of what's constraining your games is
your motivational substructure and those

791
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:40,560
ancient circuits that are status
oriented and they operate within

792
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,890
virtually every animal has a status.
Counter creatures organize themselves

793
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:50,040
into dominance hierarchies.
The reason they do that is because that

794
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:52,320
works.
It's a solution.

795
00:44:52,321 --> 00:44:55,110
It's a solution to the Darwinian problem
of existence.

796
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:59,310
It's not just an empathy phenomena.
It's the real thing.

797
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,890
So you,
your environment,

798
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:05,910
fundamentally a huge chunk of your
environment is dominance hierarchy plus

799
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,360
God only knows where you are and that's
order and chaos.

800
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:12,750
And part of the reason that people fight
to preserve their dominance hierarchies

801
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:17,100
is because it's better to be a slave.
Who knows what the hell is going on than

802
00:45:17,101 --> 00:45:20,220
someone who's thrown screaming and naked
into the jungle at night.

803
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:23,100
And that's the difference between order
and chaos,

804
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:27,660
and we like order better than chaos and
it's no wonder now we'll invite a little

805
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:32,220
chaos in for entertainment now and then.
But it has to be done voluntarily.

806
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:36,240
And generally you don't want the kind of
chaos that upsets your entire conceptual

807
00:45:36,241 --> 00:45:37,290
structure.
You know,

808
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,660
you're willing to fool around on the
fringes a little bit,

809
00:45:39,661 --> 00:45:41,490
but you know when the going gets
serious,

810
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:44,490
you're pretty much likely to bail out
and no wonder.

811
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,830
Now I wanted to tell you a little bit
about

812
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:53,800
this chaotic domain.
I can tell you a couple of things about

813
00:45:53,801 --> 00:45:54,634
it.

814
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,860
It's the underworld of mythology.
One of the things that's kind of

815
00:45:59,861 --> 00:46:03,130
interesting about the underworld is that
it has a suburb and one of the suburbs

816
00:46:03,131 --> 00:46:07,840
of the underworld is hell and hell is
the place where you end up when

817
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:13,860
everything that you know falls apart and
you get resentful and bitter about it.

818
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:15,540
And that's very,
like I.

819
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:19,330
One of the things I've noticed in my
work as a clinical psychologist,

820
00:46:19,331 --> 00:46:23,380
that there's two things that really do
people in three lying.

821
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,400
That's not good.
Apart from that resentment and

822
00:46:27,401 --> 00:46:29,920
arrogance,
if you get resentful enough,

823
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:34,750
you end up like Elliot Rogers and all
those other people who go on random

824
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:38,200
shooting sprees because they have a
disagreement about the structure of the

825
00:46:38,201 --> 00:46:41,770
exist of existence and the fact that
they ended up hypothetically at the

826
00:46:41,771 --> 00:46:45,190
bottom of the heap,
so those are real places and people get

827
00:46:45,191 --> 00:46:49,390
stuck in them and they are not places
that you would voluntarily choose to go

828
00:46:49,391 --> 00:46:51,190
if you had any sense at all,
and I'll tell you,

829
00:46:51,191 --> 00:46:55,660
if you read the accounts of the people
who do random mass murder,

830
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:59,470
they'll tell you exactly where they are
and they'll tell you exactly what

831
00:46:59,471 --> 00:47:03,280
they're motivated to do and what they're
motivated to do is take as much revenge

832
00:47:03,281 --> 00:47:04,960
on existence as they possibly could.

833
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,820
Imagine in the most unfair possible way,
as fast as they can possibly manage it,

834
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,760
and that's their conscious aim and he
says,

835
00:47:12,761 --> 00:47:16,240
not a form of insanity.
They know exactly what they're doing.

836
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:19,270
They have a.
They have a precise idea of what they're

837
00:47:19,271 --> 00:47:23,140
in the APP and it's a deep archetypal
possession,

838
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,640
for lack of a better word.

839
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,273
Now

840
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,230
I want to show you how some of these
things are mapped

841
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,340
symbolically.
They're not really symbols in my

842
00:47:40,341 --> 00:47:45,341
estimation because assemble implies that
something is being represented.

843
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:49,580
You know that there's a reality behind
the representation that's broader than

844
00:47:49,581 --> 00:47:52,010
the representation and assemble is just
a shadow of it.

845
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,700
These aren't symbols.
Their representations that are as

846
00:47:55,701 --> 00:48:00,701
accurate as they can possibly be.
I'll start with something that's rather

847
00:48:06,461 --> 00:48:10,650
easy to understand.
Let's try.

848
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,510
Yes.
What happens when you look at her

849
00:48:18,511 --> 00:48:19,344
Medusa?

850
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,700
You turned to stone.
What happens when your rabbit sees a

851
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:27,550
wolf?
That's right.

852
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:29,230
It turns to stone.
That's right.

853
00:48:29,231 --> 00:48:34,231
The Medusa is a symbol.
It's a representation of all those

854
00:48:34,601 --> 00:48:37,000
things that make you turn to stone.
When you look at them.

855
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:38,403
Now,
look,

856
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,020
animals can deal with threat,
right?

857
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:44,680
They have instincts to deal with threat,
but zebras,

858
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:48,640
maybe there's a bunch of zebras and
they're out there and heard and there's

859
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:50,200
a bunch of lines and they're right
there,

860
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:51,700
and the zebras,
what are they doing?

861
00:48:51,701 --> 00:48:53,380
They're grazing and you think,
wow,

862
00:48:53,381 --> 00:48:55,780
those zebras aren't very bright because
there's a bunch of lions,

863
00:48:55,781 --> 00:48:56,620
like,
why aren't they,

864
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,670
you know,
in the forest building a Fort Pete Lyons

865
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,630
out,
but they,

866
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,850
the reason they're not doing that is
because although they can react to

867
00:49:03,851 --> 00:49:07,630
threat,
they cannot conceive to the of the class

868
00:49:07,631 --> 00:49:12,040
of threatening objects.
Now human beings can conceive of the

869
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:17,070
class of threatening objects and so what
civilization is in large part is an

870
00:49:17,111 --> 00:49:20,980
attempt to find a remedy for the class
of threatening objects.

871
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:23,650
Now there are representations of those
sorts of things.

872
00:49:23,651 --> 00:49:26,680
The Medusa is one of them.
The reason it's feminine is very

873
00:49:26,681 --> 00:49:29,920
difficult to explain and I don't think I
have the time unfortunately,

874
00:49:29,921 --> 00:49:34,240
but you'll have to take my word for it.
You see the little cartoon of Robert

875
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,660
Crumb off to the left there and he's got
a big eatable problem,

876
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:41,130
old rob chrome.
And the problem with him fundamentally

877
00:49:41,131 --> 00:49:44,620
as his mother was something like a giant
spider and did everything she possibly

878
00:49:44,621 --> 00:49:46,930
could to crush the life out of him
hands,

879
00:49:46,931 --> 00:49:50,820
his remaining relationship with women.
And so that's part of the reason why the

880
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:55,830
femininity can be a
something that turns you to stone.

881
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,770
It's an experience that many men are
familiar with by the way,

882
00:49:59,771 --> 00:50:03,760
because the average man is rejected far
more often than he's accepted.

883
00:50:03,761 --> 00:50:06,790
And since women are the gateway to
reproduction,

884
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:12,090
they constitute nature itself.
And Nature itself tells most men you

885
00:50:12,371 --> 00:50:17,371
should go home and stay under your bed.
There's lots of experiments done about

886
00:50:18,401 --> 00:50:19,450
this.
So for example,

887
00:50:19,451 --> 00:50:23,110
psychologists have an undergraduate
woman go out into the concourse and see

888
00:50:23,111 --> 00:50:25,810
how long it takes.
Someone heard to find someone who agrees

889
00:50:25,811 --> 00:50:27,980
to sleep with her.
Now it takes like,

890
00:50:27,981 --> 00:50:28,814
you know,

891
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,480
two seconds after she asks the first man
and then,

892
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:36,180
and then they flip it,
you know,

893
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:39,160
and they get your random undergraduate
guy to do the same thing.

894
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,930
It's well,
you could imagine the consequences of

895
00:50:40,931 --> 00:50:43,840
that since many of you men have lived
through it,

896
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:51,240
mother nature with a woman wears the
face of Mother Nature and the face his

897
00:50:51,911 --> 00:50:54,190
generally rejecting,
especially to men who are low in the

898
00:50:54,191 --> 00:50:56,560
dominance hierarchy by the way,
which is one of the things that

899
00:50:56,561 --> 00:51:00,010
irritates guys like Elliot Rogers and
one of the things that motivates their

900
00:51:00,011 --> 00:51:03,010
desire to take revenge.
That's a universal phenomenon,

901
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:08,290
so that's part of the reason that the
feminine is nature and why nature.

902
00:51:08,291 --> 00:51:10,330
By the way,
his mother nature is like,

903
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:15,010
it's diagnosis of your status is not
good enough and no wonder

904
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:23,860
what seems to have happened
fundamentally is that these domains that

905
00:51:23,861 --> 00:51:26,980
I talked to you about,
which can be represented as chaos and

906
00:51:26,981 --> 00:51:30,700
order,
say an r from the that was perspective

907
00:51:30,701 --> 00:51:33,160
can also be represented as masculine and
feminine.

908
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,220
And I think the reason for that is that

909
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,000
human beings are fundamentally social
primates,

910
00:51:40,001 --> 00:51:40,691
right?
We're very,

911
00:51:40,691 --> 00:51:45,610
very social and we know that one of the
correlates of brain size in primates,

912
00:51:45,611 --> 00:51:48,880
the social group size,
and we also know that most primates say

913
00:51:48,881 --> 00:51:52,930
chimps who were quite closely related to
they don't like go out and investigate

914
00:51:52,931 --> 00:51:55,060
leaves and you know period things
through microscopes.

915
00:51:55,061 --> 00:51:58,150
They spend all their time interacting
with other chimpanzees.

916
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:00,730
Although they're chewing all the time.
They do it because they have a

917
00:52:00,731 --> 00:52:02,730
ridiculously ineffective,
you know,

918
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:07,740
digestive and an eating system.
Their brain is adapted

919
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,200
to the social circumstances as the
primary reality.

920
00:52:14,201 --> 00:52:15,011
So you could say,
well,

921
00:52:15,011 --> 00:52:18,840
tribe is the primary reality and then
there's a secondary reality which is all

922
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:23,260
that which is outside tribe and that
corresponds to chaos and order.

923
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:31,030
Order in contradiction to chaos is
symbolized by masculine symbols.

924
00:52:31,211 --> 00:52:36,211
And that's for example why etiologies
like radical feminism presume the

925
00:52:36,381 --> 00:52:40,040
existence of a patriarchy.
It fits into the symbolic structure of

926
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:41,150
our minds.
That idea,

927
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:45,200
and it's true in some sense because just
like in chimpanzee troops,

928
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,430
the primary or Metta hierarchy that
makes up human civilization is

929
00:52:49,431 --> 00:52:54,050
fundamentally masculine in its origin
and structure and so masculine is

930
00:52:54,051 --> 00:52:58,010
fundamentally the dominance hierarchy.
And Feminine is some fundamentally all

931
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:01,880
the things that are outside or that
challenged the dominance hierarchy and

932
00:53:01,881 --> 00:53:03,530
so it's,
and it's a perfectly reasonable,

933
00:53:03,531 --> 00:53:08,531
it's weird a because our brain is
organized to fundamentally apprehend the

934
00:53:09,681 --> 00:53:12,950
world in terms of personalities and
that's partly because you know,

935
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,680
as we've emerged over the course of
evolution,

936
00:53:15,681 --> 00:53:19,010
it's been relatively constant that there
were males around and that there were

937
00:53:19,011 --> 00:53:22,850
females around and that the males were
fathers and that the females were

938
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,040
mothers and you know,
that they were both mates as well.

939
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,850
It's a constant of the evolutionary
landscape and that's what our brains

940
00:53:29,851 --> 00:53:32,550
evolved to process.
And then what happened when we developed

941
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:37,790
the capacity to abstract is we use this
underlying social cognitive abstraction

942
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:43,830
structure to start to represent the
structure of being itself.

943
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:45,210
So we could say,
well,

944
00:53:45,211 --> 00:53:48,780
there's a dominance hierarchy in that
society and that's masculine and there's

945
00:53:48,781 --> 00:53:52,020
all the things that challenge the
dominance hierarchy and they're outside

946
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:55,170
in their feminine.
The weirdest thing about that,

947
00:53:55,171 --> 00:53:57,480
however,
is that it actually works.

948
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,390
You know,
we've got away with that for some

949
00:54:00,391 --> 00:54:02,670
reason.
It seems to be perfectly reasonable to

950
00:54:02,671 --> 00:54:05,640
map the world in that manner.
It keeps us going.

951
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:19,500
All right,
I'm going to try to explain this.

952
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:24,501
This is nail chemical symbol
at the bottom of the symbol.

953
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:32,090
There's this round thing with wings.
Do you ever see Harry Potter?

954
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:35,190
Yeah.
You know the game quidditch.

955
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:39,720
You remember what they chase chase a
gold one of those.

956
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,960
All right,
so they call that the snitch,

957
00:54:42,961 --> 00:54:44,930
I believe,
and there's little fragment of soil and

958
00:54:44,931 --> 00:54:48,030
it's very interesting idea because for
the alchemists,

959
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:51,750
the primary element of reality,
whatever that was could be

960
00:54:51,751 --> 00:54:56,280
conceptualized as this thing is round
chaos and what it was conceptualized

961
00:54:56,281 --> 00:54:57,510
have in part was

962
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:02,920
it was a container from which matter and
spirit could emerge and what you might

963
00:55:02,921 --> 00:55:03,251
ask,
well,

964
00:55:03,251 --> 00:55:06,400
what does that mean?
This is what it means.

965
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:13,210
When a child experiences something,
it can't predict.

966
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:18,850
It does the thing that led to that
uncertain outcome over and over and over

967
00:55:18,851 --> 00:55:21,820
and over until it can map it,
and then you think,

968
00:55:21,821 --> 00:55:23,170
well,
what did the child do?

969
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:28,350
What the child did was take the domain
of that which it did not understand and

970
00:55:28,541 --> 00:55:31,990
it transformed it into matter,
which is the predictable world of

971
00:55:31,991 --> 00:55:35,470
entities and spirit,
which is the internal psychological

972
00:55:35,471 --> 00:55:39,070
structure that's adapted to that,
and so what the alchemists basically

973
00:55:39,071 --> 00:55:44,071
conceptualized was that
what exists outside of your conceptual

974
00:55:45,991 --> 00:55:49,650
framework is something like unrealized
potential,

975
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,620
and when you interact with that
unrealized potential,

976
00:55:52,621 --> 00:55:55,890
you actualize it and you actualize it
into two component elements,

977
00:55:55,891 --> 00:55:59,700
one being the material world and the
other being your own psychological

978
00:55:59,701 --> 00:56:02,580
structure.
That's why they conceptualized matter

979
00:56:02,581 --> 00:56:05,730
and spirit,
container of matter and spirit as the

980
00:56:05,731 --> 00:56:08,340
ultimate reality,
and out of that emerged something that

981
00:56:08,341 --> 00:56:10,440
was quite primordial,
which is the dragon.

982
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:14,430
Now,
one of the things we know

983
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:17,660
you remember in the genesis story,

984
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:23,040
it's the snake that gives people vision.
Do you remember?

985
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:27,010
It gives him wisdom and it also produces
selfconsciousness.

986
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,750
There's a woman named Lynn Isabelle,
who's an anthropologist in La and she

987
00:56:33,751 --> 00:56:36,630
was very interested in human being site
because we can really see,

988
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,990
we can see better than any other
creature except predatory birds.

989
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,450
We can see way better than most
primates.

990
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,940
Isabelle knew that our tree dwelling
ancestors,

991
00:56:46,941 --> 00:56:50,510
some 60 million years ago,
emerged at about the same time as

992
00:56:50,511 --> 00:56:53,570
snakes.
They're younger than lizards by the way,

993
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:58,160
and that we were preyed on quite
intensely by snakes for tens of millions

994
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,810
of years,
and she also knew that we were good at

995
00:56:59,811 --> 00:57:02,120
detecting snakes in the bottom of our
visual field,

996
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:05,900
and then we were particularly good at
protecting the camouflage patterns of

997
00:57:05,901 --> 00:57:07,640
snakes and the bottom of our visual
field.

998
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:12,680
So she did a series of field experiments
showing that primate visual acuity was

999
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:16,430
correlated strongly with the presence of
predatory snakes in the immediate

1000
00:57:16,431 --> 00:57:21,431
environment.
So the idea that snakes gave us vision

1001
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:24,590
is right now,
why is that relevant to this?

1002
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,860
We were preyed upon for a very long
period of time and we developed a neural

1003
00:57:30,861 --> 00:57:34,120
circuit to deal with predators and
that's the neural circuit that's

1004
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:38,230
activated and children when they're
terrified about monsters at night.

1005
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:43,060
So the Predator entity,
which is this dragon,

1006
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:46,780
it's like a.
it's like an amalgam of predatory forces

1007
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:51,190
is one of the manifestations of the
things that exist outside of the

1008
00:57:51,191 --> 00:57:52,700
dominance hierarchy.
So it's a.

1009
00:57:52,701 --> 00:57:56,410
it's a form of primordial reality.
It's not abstract anymore like the

1010
00:57:56,411 --> 00:57:59,860
matter and spirit container.
It's like the first practical

1011
00:57:59,861 --> 00:58:04,270
manifestation of what's terrifying and
threatening concretely outside that,

1012
00:58:04,271 --> 00:58:08,980
and so remember,
animals can respond to threat,

1013
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:11,590
but they can't conceptualize threat as a
category.

1014
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,580
That's the conceptualization of threat
as a category.

1015
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:19,030
It emerges from the absolute unknown.
It manifests itself as threat.

1016
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:22,900
So for example,
if you hear a loud noise behind you or a

1017
00:58:22,901 --> 00:58:26,350
grow when you're in the forest,
the first thing that happens is you

1018
00:58:26,351 --> 00:58:29,800
don't know what's going on and that's
the initial state of contact with

1019
00:58:29,801 --> 00:58:33,220
potential and then if you turn around
and you look,

1020
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:36,910
that potential manifests itself into
something that's predatory and you have

1021
00:58:36,911 --> 00:58:41,110
a circuit for that and that's the same
circuit that we now use to assess

1022
00:58:41,111 --> 00:58:44,980
anything unexpected that it occurs to us
and I think that circuit had become from

1023
00:58:44,981 --> 00:58:45,814
somewhere.

1024
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:50,800
And so our capacity to respond to
surprising entities is an elaboration

1025
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:55,870
elaboration up into abstraction of our
capacity to identify predators.

1026
00:58:56,170 --> 00:59:01,170
So that's the next level of reality.
And out of that chaotic circumstance

1027
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:07,590
comes something that's more human and
that that is the emergence of

1028
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:12,010
masculinity and femininity out out of
that more primordial element.

1029
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:22,343
Okay.

1030
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:33,730
Let me show you two things.
This is a map of

1031
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,490
pragmatic territory as far as I can
tell.

1032
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:45,380
It's the territory that people actually
inhabit at the first level.

1033
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,930
It's the square I called that the dragon
of chaos.

1034
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:53,990
That's the unknown as such,
and it's the thing that you fall into

1035
00:59:53,991 --> 00:59:56,060
when you're conceptual schemes fall
apart.

1036
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:02,500
What manifests itself out of that is
femininity and femininity comes in two

1037
01:00:04,181 --> 01:00:06,610
forms.
One is benevolent femininity.

1038
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:08,650
Example would be

1039
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:10,453
this.

1040
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:15,900
You see Mary on the left there.
She's in a structure called a man door

1041
01:00:15,901 --> 01:00:18,890
lock,
which is from a Freudian perspective,

1042
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:23,300
has obvious sexual connotations.
You see,

1043
01:00:23,301 --> 01:00:27,320
if you look carefully that she's
standing on a reptile and holding her

1044
01:00:27,321 --> 01:00:30,980
child away from it.
That's a common medieval Christian

1045
01:00:30,981 --> 01:00:33,360
image.
You can think of it as divine because

1046
01:00:33,361 --> 01:00:36,330
women's spent an awful lot of time doing
that with their children over the course

1047
01:00:36,331 --> 01:00:40,080
of our millions of years of evolution.
And it's something that's sacred because

1048
01:00:40,081 --> 01:00:44,610
our species dependent on that for its
for its survival,

1049
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,010
this one's even better.
This is a medieval image.

1050
01:00:47,011 --> 01:00:50,250
I love this image.
So there's Mary with the Christ child

1051
01:00:50,251 --> 01:00:53,940
and she standing again on a reptile
predatory rep top,

1052
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,490
but in the background you see all those
weird little shapes.

1053
01:00:57,530 --> 01:01:02,530
Those are musical instruments and that
they feel space and the medieval artists

1054
01:01:03,211 --> 01:01:08,211
who drew this picture had this
intimation that behind the manifestation

1055
01:01:08,971 --> 01:01:13,971
that something as primary as the
protective maternity of Mary was

1056
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:19,530
something like the music of the spheres
or are a collection of harmonious

1057
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:24,390
patterns and that this figure was
constantly emerging out of that

1058
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:29,420
background of harmonious patterns across
the infinite stretches of time itself.

1059
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:34,590
That's the sacred image because it
represents something that human society

1060
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:39,591
cannot live without.
Like any society that doesn't regard the

1061
01:01:39,661 --> 01:01:43,680
Virgin and the Child Who protects the
child from the predatory serpent as a

1062
01:01:43,681 --> 01:01:48,330
prime element of sacred reality is going
to make itself estate.

1063
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,730
You know,
I could say for example,

1064
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,630
that that's what's happening to the
indigenous populations of eastern Europe

1065
01:01:54,631 --> 01:01:57,450
at the moment where their birth rate is
far below replacement.

1066
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:06,380
I'm going to show you another image.
This is called a village or open virgin

1067
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,580
and it was a common representation in
medieval Europe and it's a weird

1068
01:02:11,581 --> 01:02:14,790
representation from a Christian
perspective because it kind of reverses

1069
01:02:14,791 --> 01:02:19,740
the normal hierarchy of power.
What you have here is Mary,

1070
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,230
she's holding the Christ child when the
statute was closed and then you open her

1071
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,580
out.
Why don't you see inside Mary is God the

1072
01:02:26,581 --> 01:02:31,320
father and God the father is holding
Christ in his hands.

1073
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,633
Now

1074
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:38,190
Mary constitutes the superordinate
benevolent feminine.

1075
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:43,780
Inside her is the structure of culture,
so you can think inside nature is the

1076
01:02:43,831 --> 01:02:48,300
structure of culture and that's
represented in this image by God because

1077
01:02:48,301 --> 01:02:50,700
he's the ultimate father obviously and
Christian thinking,

1078
01:02:50,701 --> 01:02:55,440
and then the God figure is holding what?
Crucified individual.

1079
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:59,910
What does that mean?
Now all the people around their kings,

1080
01:02:59,911 --> 01:03:02,070
Queens,
commenters are all gazing at that

1081
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:04,650
central figure,
which of course is fundamentally what

1082
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:08,580
everyone in western civilization has
been doing for 2000 years.

1083
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,350
Not knowing why

1084
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:18,130
nature gives rise to culture.
Culture gives rise to the suffering

1085
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:19,840
individual.
Well,

1086
01:03:19,841 --> 01:03:22,920
that's true enough.
It's true for everyone.

1087
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,420
It's true for life at every point in
time,

1088
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:30,370
but there's more to the image of the
crucifixion because crucifixion also

1089
01:03:30,371 --> 01:03:35,371
represents voluntary acceptance of
suffering and voluntary acceptance of

1090
01:03:36,281 --> 01:03:39,190
death,
and it also points to something else

1091
01:03:39,191 --> 01:03:43,510
that's of paramount importance,
which is that there's an element of the

1092
01:03:43,511 --> 01:03:47,860
human psyche that can die and come back
and die and come back.

1093
01:03:47,861 --> 01:03:52,600
And that's what happens to you.
When you encounter a catastrophe and you

1094
01:03:52,601 --> 01:03:56,710
make order of it and you climb back out
of the underworld and your.

1095
01:03:56,770 --> 01:04:00,040
Your voice through life is punctuated by
trips to the underworld.

1096
01:04:00,041 --> 01:04:04,000
And so you're somewhere and then you go
outside that and then you go somewhere

1097
01:04:04,001 --> 01:04:07,900
else and then you go outside that.
And so what happens to people is they

1098
01:04:07,901 --> 01:04:11,470
generally identify with where they are
order,

1099
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:15,910
but order dissolves and collapses,
and then it reconstitutes itself.

1100
01:04:15,911 --> 01:04:18,850
So then you might say,
if you are trying to adapt to the

1101
01:04:18,851 --> 01:04:23,200
structure of reality itself,
instead of identifying with order,

1102
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:28,180
you would identify with a process that
allowed you to transform yourself across

1103
01:04:28,181 --> 01:04:33,010
repeated bouts of order and chaos.
And that's what these sorts of images or

1104
01:04:33,011 --> 01:04:35,110
trying to represent.
So

1105
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:42,870
let me show you
one final idea.

1106
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:54,510
Here's a taoist idea that's like this.
So the Dallas symbol,

1107
01:04:54,511 --> 01:04:56,570
you know the dallas symbol,
I already talked to you about it and

1108
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:58,470
you've all seen it.
Chaos and order,

1109
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,720
man,
masculine and feminine,

1110
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:06,500
constantly in interplay.
That's Dow from the Taoist perspective.

1111
01:05:07,621 --> 01:05:11,550
And Dow is the source of meaning.
So the idea there is that it's the

1112
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,080
constant interplay between chaos and
order that produces the sense of meaning

1113
01:05:16,081 --> 01:05:18,490
and human beings.
And that's true.

1114
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,420
That is what produces the sense of
meaning.

1115
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:25,500
You know that because when you're
engaged in a compelling operation,

1116
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:30,210
you're partly ordered and secure and you
have one foot out into the unknown and

1117
01:05:30,211 --> 01:05:33,600
the balance is proper and as a
consequence you're engaged in what

1118
01:05:33,601 --> 01:05:35,400
you're doing and then as a consequence
of that,

1119
01:05:35,401 --> 01:05:39,480
you lose your self consciousness and if
you stay engaged in that sort of

1120
01:05:39,481 --> 01:05:43,110
situation on a continual basis,
then that you find that your life is

1121
01:05:43,111 --> 01:05:46,920
meaningful and rich and that's the best
antidote to the fact that life is

1122
01:05:46,921 --> 01:05:49,530
bounded and full of suffering.
Now,

1123
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:54,660
Tao means meaning.
It also means journey and the center of

1124
01:05:54,661 --> 01:05:59,460
the Tao is the place you're supposed to
be one foot in chaos and one foot in

1125
01:05:59,461 --> 01:06:04,410
order and that's the best place to be in
the actual environment itself.

1126
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:08,310
Because the actual environment is better
construed as the constant interplay

1127
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:12,120
between chaos and order than it is
construed as a collection of material

1128
01:06:12,121 --> 01:06:12,954
objects.

1129
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:18,340
And if you adopt the pragmatic view that
points out that there are metta

1130
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:21,600
realities above the mirror objects that
we perceive.

1131
01:06:21,601 --> 01:06:25,260
You can also apprehend that our brains
are actually adapted to the Metta

1132
01:06:25,261 --> 01:06:27,840
realities and not.
The reality is because our brains are

1133
01:06:27,841 --> 01:06:31,800
like $300,
million years old and what we've done is

1134
01:06:31,801 --> 01:06:34,200
extracted out those things that are
constant,

1135
01:06:34,201 --> 01:06:38,400
that cross spends of times,
fans of kinds that are hundreds of

1136
01:06:38,401 --> 01:06:42,330
millions of years in length and those
aren't chairs and tables are

1137
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:45,450
automobiles.
There they're metal structures that are

1138
01:06:45,451 --> 01:06:49,860
much more sophisticated than that and we
ignore that at our peril because modern

1139
01:06:49,861 --> 01:06:51,870
people don't believe that meaning
exists.

1140
01:06:51,871 --> 01:06:53,910
They think it's EPA.
Phenomenal.

1141
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,960
There's nothing subjective about our
worldview when in fact our nervous

1142
01:06:57,961 --> 01:07:02,670
systems are tuned so that life is
manifesting itself in the most

1143
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,910
meaningful possible way.
When you happen to be occupying the

1144
01:07:05,911 --> 01:07:10,911
precise position between chaos and order
that maximizes your security and the

1145
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:14,130
development of that security across
time,

1146
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,810
and that's not.
That's the most real thing there is,

1147
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:24,110
and to stay in that position is also to
accept voluntarily the necessity for a

1148
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:29,670
certain degree of suffering.
Because as you extend your capacities by

1149
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,760
exposing yourself to the optimal level
of the unknown,

1150
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,990
you're constantly taking yourself apart
and rebuilding yourself,

1151
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:41,340
and that's what allows you to thrive not
only in the presence of stability,

1152
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:45,750
but also in a state that consists of the
transformation of that stability.

1153
01:07:57,770 --> 01:07:59,810
Here's a representation for maintenance
Egypt.

1154
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:06,390
These are representations of Horace.
There's a lot of evidence that many of

1155
01:08:06,391 --> 01:08:09,510
the ideas we have about Christ or
derivatives of Egyptian ideas,

1156
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:15,800
most people who point that out
pointed out in a manner same debt,

1157
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:16,610
devaluing

1158
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:20,900
the ideas that were derived from ego
because they have an a priori motive,

1159
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,820
which is a destructive motive.

1160
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:27,510
As mythology progresses across the
centuries,

1161
01:08:27,511 --> 01:08:31,650
it transforms itself and attempts to
continually encapsulate Rayanne

1162
01:08:31,651 --> 01:08:34,530
capsulate.
The primary idea is that the human race

1163
01:08:34,531 --> 01:08:38,400
has managed to produce about the
structure of reality itself.

1164
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:42,600
There's constant sees across these
cultural manifestations because the

1165
01:08:42,601 --> 01:08:44,970
reality too,
which they route to which they refer,

1166
01:08:44,971 --> 01:08:48,360
is actually reality.
Horace,

1167
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,650
this is a good lesson and I'll leave you
with this horse,

1168
01:08:52,651 --> 01:08:53,484
is the eye.

1169
01:08:55,550 --> 01:09:00,550
The eye is not the intellect.
The intellect is the thing that forces

1170
01:09:00,681 --> 01:09:05,390
everything into a preexisting structure
and it crunches reality.

1171
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:10,100
To do that at warp it and twists it and
it makes people ideological and rigid.

1172
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:12,440
The eye is something completely
different.

1173
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:17,480
The I is the thing that pays attention
and your attention is automatically

1174
01:09:17,481 --> 01:09:21,800
directed to those elements of your
experiential field where the most

1175
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:24,950
information is manifesting itself.
That's why,

1176
01:09:24,951 --> 01:09:26,720
for example,
if you're talking to someone in a bar

1177
01:09:26,721 --> 01:09:30,630
and there's a TV flickering,
you can't help but look at the TV that

1178
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,020
change,
that transformation is what your nervous

1179
01:09:33,021 --> 01:09:37,530
system is attuned to and the theory is
that if you're a follower of horace,

1180
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:41,510
who is the I and the Vulcan because
Falcons can see and they fly above

1181
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:43,790
everything else.
If you're a follower of horace,

1182
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:46,420
you pay attention.
When you pay attention,

1183
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:47,720
you absorb information.

1184
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:52,750
When you absorb information,
you continually transform yourself and

1185
01:09:53,391 --> 01:09:56,030
that keeps you on top of it ever.
Shifting reality.

1186
01:09:56,570 --> 01:10:01,160
Doing that is meaningful and that's what
stops you from becoming bitter and cruel

1187
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:03,980
because you know life is suffering.
You know,

1188
01:10:03,981 --> 01:10:06,800
and if you don't have an antidote to
that suffering that's real,

1189
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:10,490
then you become resentful about the
structure of experience and then you'll

1190
01:10:10,491 --> 01:10:12,620
do everything you can to take revenge on
it.

1191
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:18,770
And we saw what happened when people did
that in the 20th century and it would be

1192
01:10:18,771 --> 01:10:23,570
a good thing if people woke up and stop
doing it and as far as I can tell after

1193
01:10:23,571 --> 01:10:26,750
fig trying to figure this out for like
30 years.

1194
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:32,170
The way that you do that is by paying
attention and transforming yourself when

1195
01:10:33,141 --> 01:10:38,141
it's necessary and stopping the process
of identifying with what you already

1196
01:10:38,391 --> 01:10:41,630
believe.
Who the hell cares what you believe you

1197
01:10:41,631 --> 01:10:43,820
should be attending to the things you
don't know,

1198
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:48,710
which is a much larger space than the
things you know and then you should be

1199
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:52,490
construing yourself.
Not as the inhabitant of a sterile and

1200
01:10:52,491 --> 01:10:57,491
static and already completed structure,
but as the thing that lives on the edge

1201
01:10:57,651 --> 01:10:59,810
of that.
That's constantly building and

1202
01:10:59,811 --> 01:11:04,280
rebuilding it and then if something
happens to your structure,

1203
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:07,460
it's not so relevant because that's not
what you are.

1204
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:12,080
You're the thing that can engage in
transformations of structure by paying

1205
01:11:12,081 --> 01:11:12,914
attention,

1206
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:18,500
and that's what these representations
mean.

1207
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:29,720
These are renaissance pictures.
You know they've elevated the entity

1208
01:11:29,721 --> 01:11:33,050
that voluntarily accepts the necessity
of suffering and death,

1209
01:11:33,070 --> 01:11:37,490
so that's represented by Christ to the
highest position in the heavenly

1210
01:11:37,491 --> 01:11:42,491
hierarchy.
What that idea means is that what should

1211
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:51,460
constitute the transcendent value that
sits above all other values

1212
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:58,760
is your capacity to voluntarily accept
they're restricted and painful

1213
01:12:00,301 --> 01:12:05,301
conditions of your life.
To face them and as a consequence of

1214
01:12:05,431 --> 01:12:08,800
facing them immediately transcend them.
Now,

1215
01:12:08,801 --> 01:12:12,360
one of the things we know from clinical
psychology is that if you have someone

1216
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:13,470
who's afraid

1217
01:12:14,450 --> 01:12:17,540
they avoid,
so what do you do about that?

1218
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:22,540
You break down the thing they're afraid
of til you find a small unit that take

1219
01:12:22,541 --> 01:12:25,190
an approach.
When they approach it,

1220
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:29,270
they learned that they can approach it
and that they're more than they thought

1221
01:12:29,271 --> 01:12:31,640
they were,
and then they can approach the next

1222
01:12:31,641 --> 01:12:35,300
thing and then the next thing,
and so you take a woman who's got agora

1223
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:40,070
phobia who can't get into an elevator
and a week later she can and then she

1224
01:12:40,071 --> 01:12:42,860
goes home and has the fight with her
husband that she should have had 20

1225
01:12:42,861 --> 01:12:45,440
years ago,
and the reason for that is that when

1226
01:12:45,441 --> 01:12:47,720
she's exposed to the things that she's
afraid of,

1227
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:51,770
instead of running from them,
she learns that she's the thing that can

1228
01:12:51,771 --> 01:12:55,850
be exposed to things she's afraid of.
She doesn't learn that things aren't

1229
01:12:55,851 --> 01:13:00,380
frightening and learning the thing.
She's the thing that can be exposed to

1230
01:13:00,381 --> 01:13:04,040
things that are frightening made sir
more than the frightening things.

1231
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,690
And it's certainly possible that we're
more than the things that frightened us.

1232
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:11,300
If we weren't,
we wouldn't be here.

1233
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:30,120
We shouldn't throw these things away
before we understand them and we're in

1234
01:13:30,121 --> 01:13:31,440
danger of doing that now.

1235
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:37,240
So part of what I've been trying to do
in my lectures and my work is to point

1236
01:13:37,241 --> 01:13:42,241
out what our forefathers new to try to
help modern people understand it and to

1237
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,270
make the case that these things that we
think of as

1238
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:56,510
non real representations are more real
than anything that we currently

1239
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,880
comprehend as real.

1240
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:03,820
That

1241
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:08,820
consequences of not comprehending them
and living by them as far as I can tell

1242
01:14:10,141 --> 01:14:15,141
is that things deteriorate and they can
deteriorate to a point where everything

1243
01:14:18,221 --> 01:14:23,221
is intolerable for everyone.
And that seems to be a sub optimal

1244
01:14:23,861 --> 01:14:24,700
destination.

1245
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:27,473
So

1246
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:29,570
thanks for the invitation.

1247
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:37,030
Thank you.
