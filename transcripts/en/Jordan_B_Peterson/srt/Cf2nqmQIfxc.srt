1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,143
So,
um,

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,740
I want to recommend a book first to 
everyone here.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,770
It's called explaining postmodernism and
it's by a gentleman named Steven Hicks,

4
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:18,000
and you need to understand postmodernism
because that's what you're up against.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,570
You're up against it far more than you 
know or think,

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,020
and it's a much more well developed and 
a pervasive pernicious,

7
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,194
nihilistic,
intellectually attractive doctrine than 

8
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,203
has yet come to public realization.
It absolutely dominates the humanities 

9
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:39,690
and increasingly the social sciences in 
the universities.

10
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:41,790
And what's happening,
you see,

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,850
someone once said,
who unfortunately I can't remember.

12
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:45,684
It might've been Friedrich Nietzsche 
said that everybody is the unconscious 

13
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:51,230
exponent of a dead philosopher.
And uh,

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,230
fortunately the postmodern philosophers,
most of them are dead.

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,073
So that's a good thing.
But that doesn't mean that their words 

16
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:00,350
aren't continually being spoken by 
people who,

17
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,160
who are following in their wake,
let's say.

18
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:05,510
And it's not like any given person is 
absolutely possessed,

19
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,403
say by the spirit of postmodernism,
because often they're not educated 

20
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:12,750
enough to know all the details about 
what it is that has them in their grip.

21
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,363
But if you get 20 of them together and 
they're all five percent influenced by 

22
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:20,850
the postmodernist ethos,
you basically have the spirit of the mob

23
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,060
that's a mouthpiece for that particular 
philosophical doctrine.

24
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,133
And if you understand the doctrine,
then you understand why things are 

25
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,150
progressing the way that they are 
progressing.

26
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:30,984
And so I'm going to tell you a little 
bit about the doctrine because it's not 

27
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:35,304
optional to understand this.
It's absolutely crucial to understand 

28
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:39,174
this.
You can't underestimate the power of 

29
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:44,370
ideas and also the power of words of 
course,

30
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,204
because ideas are expressed in words,
but you see the postmodernists 

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,200
completely reject the structure of 
Western civilization.

32
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,183
And I mean completely.
So I can give you an example in one 

33
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:56,640
term,
Jacques Derrida,

34
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,503
who's head trickster for the 
postmodernist movement regarded Western 

35
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:02,064
culture,
let's call it the patriarchy as fellow 

36
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:05,220
goes centric.
Okay?

37
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:08,310
So follow comes from Fellas,
p h a l,

38
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:09,120
l o.

39
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,953
and so that's the insistence that what 
you see in Western culture is the 

40
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,690
consequence of a male dominated,
oppressive,

41
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,410
a self serving society.
And we might say,

42
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:20,070
well,
you know,

43
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,903
societies do tend to be self serving and
people in power do tend to act in their 

44
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:25,314
best interests,
but a tendency is not an absolute and 

45
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:31,350
that's one of the things that needs to 
be considered continually.

46
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,184
There are no shortage of flaws in the 
manner in which we've structured our 

47
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:38,400
society and compared to any hypothetical
utopia,

48
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:39,234
it's an absolutely dismal rec,
but compared to the rest of the world 

49
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,780
and the plight of other societies 
throughout the history of mankind,

50
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:46,614
we're doing pretty damn well and we 
should be happy to be living in the 

51
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:49,830
society that we're living in.

52
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,120
So the first one

53
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,093
thing that you might want to note about 
postmodernism is that it doesn't have a 

54
00:02:57,231 --> 00:02:58,064
shred of gratitude and there's something
pathologically wrong with a person who 

55
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:02,360
does have.
It,

56
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,193
doesn't have any gratitude,
especially when they lived in what so 

57
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:09,290
far is the best of all possible worlds.
And so if you're not great for a,

58
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:12,700
you're driven by resentment and 
resentment is the boat the worst emotion

59
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:15,370
that you can possibly experience apart 
from arrogancy,

60
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,530
resentment,
arrogance and deceit.

61
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,603
There's an evil triad for you,
and if you're bitter about everything 

62
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:22,144
that's happening around you,
despite the fact that you're bathed in 

63
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:24,874
wealth,
then there's something absolutely wrong 

64
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:26,674
with you.
You know the black community in the 

65
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,100
United States is the 18th wealthiest 
community,

66
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,400
18th wealthiest nation on the planet.
Now,

67
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:34,234
that doesn't mean there isn't such a 
thing as relative poverty in relative 

68
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,320
poverty matters.
It's an important,

69
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,900
it's an important political economic 
issue and it's very,

70
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:43,970
very difficult to deal with,
but absolute wealth matters too,

71
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:44,804
and and western societies have been 
absolutely remarkable in their ability 

72
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:49,120
to generate and distribute wealth.

73
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,050
As you can tell,
by just looking around,

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,233
taking a brief bit of consideration for 
the absolute miracle that even a 

75
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,134
building like this represents,
so you have to educate yourself about 

76
00:03:58,691 --> 00:03:59,770
postmodernism.
Okay,

77
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:03,460
so here's what the postmodernist belief,
they don't believe in the individual.

78
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,780
That's the logos park.
Western culture is fell logocentric logo

79
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,540
is logos.
That's partly the Christian word,

80
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,910
but it's also partly the root word of 
logic,

81
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,490
okay?
They don't believe in logic.

82
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,503
They believe that logic is part of the 
process by which the patriarchal 

83
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:24,280
institutions of the West continue to 
dominate and to justify their dominance.

84
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,300
They don't believe in dialogue.
The root word of dialogue is logos.

85
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,134
Again,
they don't believe that people of 

86
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:32,860
goodwill can come to consensus through 
the,

87
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,690
through the exchange of ideas.
They believe that that notion is part of

88
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:42,100
the philosophical substructure and 
practices of the dominant culture,

89
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,113
so the reason they don't let people who 
they don't agree with speak on campuses 

90
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:48,670
because they don't agree with letting 
people speak.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,130
You see?
It's not part of the ethos.

92
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,233
Okay,
so what else do they believe and not 

93
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,304
believe?
They believe that since you don't have 

94
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:56,884
an individual identity,
your fundamental identity is group 

95
00:04:58,961 --> 00:04:59,794
fostered,
and that means that you're basically an 

96
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,660
exemplar of your race,
hence white privilege,

97
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,673
or you're an exemplar of your gender or 
your sex or your ethnicity or your an 

98
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:12,740
exemplar of however you can be 
classified so that you,

99
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,930
you are placed in the position of victim
against the oppressor because that's the

100
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,800
game and it's,
it's a,

101
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,330
it's a postmark sleight of hand,
right?

102
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:23,164
The old Marxist notion was that the 
world was a battleground between the 

103
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:27,214
Burj waze and the proletariat and that a
failed to have any philosophical or 

104
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:33,964
ethical standing.
That argument after the working class 

105
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:40,660
actually saw its standard of living 
massively elevated as a consequence of,

106
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,340
of Western corporate democracy,
a Western free enterprise democracy,

107
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,013
and also be and and also as a 
consequence of the revelations of 

108
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:50,794
everything terrible that it happened in 
every bloody country that ever dared to 

109
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:55,860
make equity and,
and,

110
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,810
and the Marxist communist dogma part of 
their fundamental structure,

111
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,673
right,
and nothing but murderousness and 

112
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:02,634
oppression.

113
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,660
And so by the 19 seventies it was 
evident that that game was up.

114
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,543
No postmark.
The postmodernist Marxist just barely 

115
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,700
basically pulled a sleight of hand and 
said,

116
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:12,770
okay,
if it's not the poor against the rich,

117
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:15,200
it's the oppressed against the 
oppressor.

118
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:16,034
We'll just read,
divide the subpopulations in ways that 

119
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,320
make our,
our bloody philosophy continue in its,

120
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:23,060
in its,
in its movement forward.

121
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:26,510
And that's where we're at now.
And so for the postmodernists,

122
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,900
the world is a hobbs Z and battleground 
of identity groups.

123
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,020
They do not communicate with one another
because they can't.

124
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,230
All there is,
is a struggle for power and if you're in

125
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:38,390
the Predator group,
which means you're an oppressor,

126
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:41,180
then you better look out because you're 
not exactly welcome.

127
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,880
Uh,
not exactly welcome and neither are your

128
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:46,490
ideas.
So that's what you're up against.

129
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,503
I would say it's time for conservatives 
to stop apologizing for being 

130
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:51,620
conservatives.
No,

131
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,260
you don't apologize to these people.
That's a big mistake.

132
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:03,570
Apology there.
They read apology as a,

133
00:07:03,571 --> 00:07:05,490
as a,
as an admission of guilt.

134
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,710
You don't apologize and you don't back 
down.

135
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,590
You young people that are out there who 
are university students.

136
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,390
You need to take over the student 
unions.

137
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,313
You need to take them back because 
they're absolute snake pits and they 

138
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:16,230
have been since the 19th.

139
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,770
Thank you.

140
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,320
And with regards with regards to the 
universities,

141
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:25,154
I thought at one point that the best 
thing to do would be to cut their 

142
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:27,674
funding by 25 percent.
Let them fight amongst themselves for 

143
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:30,704
the remnants because it would force the 
universities to decide exactly what's 

144
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:34,304
important and what isn't.
So I would say the humanities and much 

145
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:37,454
of the social sciences have has turned 
into a postmodern Neil Marxist 

146
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,340
playground for radicals.
The scholarship is terrible.

147
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,460
Eighty percent of humanities papers 
aren't cited once,

148
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,773
once,
and so what that means is that they 

149
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:50,054
write papers for each other and they 
sell them to libraries and that's how 

150
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:54,410
the publishers make their money and no 
one reads them,

151
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:55,244
but the publishers can print them 
because the libraries have to buy them 

152
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,303
and they're buying them with your tax 
money and so all of you who are sitting 

153
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:01,574
here,
our funding and postmodern radical neo 

154
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:05,624
Marxist agenda that has its roots in the
university and your tax money is going 

155
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:10,700
towards that and if you want proof of 
that,

156
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:13,220
you just go online and look at the 
websites,

157
00:08:13,221 --> 00:08:15,740
especially of of disciplines like 
women's studies,

158
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:17,600
which has pathological right to the 
core,

159
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,020
but it's not just women's studies,
it's all the ethnic studies groups.

160
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,370
It's anthropology,
it's sociology,

161
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,233
it's social work,
and most of all it's education and 

162
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:31,020
noisy.
For example,

163
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:34,560
in Ontario is perhaps a part from the 
Ontario Human Rights Commission,

164
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:36,570
the most dangerous institution in 
Canada.

165
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,613
It should,

166
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,650
it should be defunded.
It's as simple as that.

167
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,750
They don't do the research they purport 
to do.

168
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:47,070
They're not interested in,
in,

169
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,030
in,
at all,

170
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:50,580
in education.
They're interested in the indoctrination

171
00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:51,414
of people as young as they can fund a as
young as they can get their hands on to 

172
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:56,154
speak.
Now we need to figure out our society 

173
00:08:58,261 --> 00:08:59,094
needs to figure out how to stop shunting
public tax money to radical left wing 

174
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:04,074
activists.
If we were doing that for radical right 

175
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,650
wing activists,
there would be an absolute storm,

176
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:11,760
but it's happened incrementally since 
the 19 sixties and it needs to stop.

177
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,010
So that's partly what the Conservatives,
not only conservatives,

178
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:17,844
but also liberals,
true liberals in the English sense are 

179
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:20,874
up against.
I mean what's happened as also as a 

180
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:26,850
consequence of this postmodern,
neo Marxist intellectual invasion,

181
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:30,300
is that the center keeps moving.
It's moved way to the right now.

182
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,000
So if you're a classic liberal,
you've become a conservative.

183
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,050
And so for all of you who are interested
in pursuing the conservative agenda,

184
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,660
there's a lot of classic liberals that 
you could be talking to.

185
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,510
And then finally,
with regards to talking to young people,

186
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:44,250
you finally have something to sell to 
them.

187
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,084
You know,
it's not easy to sell conservatism to 

188
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:49,770
young people because they want to change
things and that's not what conservatives

189
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:51,720
want to do.
They want to maintain things.

190
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,853
Well,
now you've got something to sell to 

191
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:54,294
young people.
You can sell them freedom of speech and 

192
00:09:57,001 --> 00:10:00,720
you can tell seldom responsibility.
The left is selling them,

193
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:03,210
right?
You can sell them responsibility.

194
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:06,000
And I can tell you because I received 
many letters of the sort that,

195
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,290
that God was talking about,
young people are absolutely starving for

196
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,990
someone to provide them with a sense of 
responsibility and say,

197
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:14,760
look,
here's something worth living for it,

198
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:15,594
man.

199
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,453
You know,
you can find meaning in life with 

200
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,440
freedom.
But freedom.

201
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,590
Freedom is a chaotic sort of meaning,
right?

202
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,120
And freedom isn't the sort of thing that
makes people happy.

203
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:30,160
It's the sort of thing that makes people
troublesome,

204
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,500
troubled,
because freedom expands your.

205
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,200
You're a series of choices and that 
makes you nervous and uncertain.

206
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:40,630
So,
but responsibility is another.

207
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,420
Not to say that that's a bad thing.
It's a good thing,

208
00:10:43,421 --> 00:10:45,280
but it it,
it requires that you,

209
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,400
that you shoulder the responsibility of 
the freedom,

210
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:53,020
but responsibility per se is what gives 
your life meaning genuine meaning in the

211
00:10:53,021 --> 00:10:56,410
face of suffering and you and young 
people are really.

212
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:57,244
They're starving for that.
I've been teaching young people for 30 

213
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:02,710
years and mostly what I've been teaching
them about his responsibility,

214
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,020
so like your arrows to a great 
tradition.

215
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,470
It's not perfect obviously,
but comparatively the nerve,

216
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,480
there's nothing else like it that's ever
been produced and it's it.

217
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,000
It represents a tiny minority of,
of,

218
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,870
of,
of human policies,

219
00:11:16,871 --> 00:11:18,840
most of which are are,
are,

220
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,733
are run by murderous,
antisocial psychopathic thugs and that 

221
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,750
seriously and so what kind of 
alternative is that?

222
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,140
We've got this beacon of freedom and 
wealth and the West that works,

223
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:35,020
although it doesn't work perfectly,
and one of the,

224
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,770
one of the responsibilities of young 
people is to find out what's at the core

225
00:11:38,771 --> 00:11:40,180
of that.
The great,

226
00:11:40,181 --> 00:11:42,640
great core of that,
the paramount,

227
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,690
the paramount importance of the 
individual and the divinity of speech.

228
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,340
Man,
that's something to sell.

229
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,830
It's what our whole culture is 
predicated on.

230
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,500
Thank you.

231
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,080
All right,
well I should stop there,

232
00:11:57,081 --> 00:11:58,850
so thank you very much for the 
invitation.
