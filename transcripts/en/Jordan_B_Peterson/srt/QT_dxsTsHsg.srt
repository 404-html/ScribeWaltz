1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,190
All right. So I'm sitting here
with, with Dr. Jordan Peterson.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,410
We were going to talk about the
weird overlap between our books.

3
00:00:09,411 --> 00:00:13,160
There's a sort of metal fiction aspect
of it because Jordan had written the

4
00:00:13,161 --> 00:00:17,420
rules for, it was a Cora entry, right? It
started to rules in Ancora. That's right.

5
00:00:17,421 --> 00:00:21,040
42 roles got pared down. So there's
going to be like 19 sequels, right?

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,040
Keep rolling them out. And um,
and I thought they were amazing.

7
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:27,070
And so I was writing or fanatics,

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,550
I was writing the first book in
the series and an orphan acts.

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,330
My main character is an assassin and he
has these sorts of 10 commandments that

10
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:39,110
are the operational rules for an assassin.
And I wanted something to offset that,

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,770
uh, for a kid who's in his life
who lives downstairs from him,

12
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:45,800
who's being raised as a good
human instead of as an assassin.

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,980
And I wanted a set of rules that
were kind of counterbalance that.

14
00:00:48,981 --> 00:00:53,660
And at the time I was reading
Jordan's, uh, rules that he listed.

15
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:58,280
And so I sort of use those
as a counterbalance is sort
of a positive masculinity

16
00:00:58,281 --> 00:01:02,210
to use to use the horrible phrase,
the weld trodden term,

17
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,650
but to actually show how somebody might
be raised properly instead of as an

18
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:08,780
international assassin.
And at the time, you know,

19
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:10,850
you were a mirror professor at u Toronto,

20
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:15,650
I thought what could possibly
be controversial about
this? Yeah. Right. And so,

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,590
so that's how it sort of,

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,740
yeah, well it was fun to see,
you know, when you create
something like those rules,

23
00:01:20,741 --> 00:01:25,741
I wrote them for Quora and I had written
like 50 Quora answers and some of them

24
00:01:25,991 --> 00:01:27,640
got disproportionately popular,

25
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:31,180
which is exactly what you'd expect
because some things get disproportionately

26
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:32,014
popular and,

27
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,820
and the core rules attracted a lot of
attention by core standards or by the

28
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:39,930
standards of what I was writing on Quora.
And then you would pick,

29
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,880
you picked him up and I thought it's one
of the things that's very interesting

30
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:45,370
about doing something creatively
is that you sort of launch it.

31
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:49,990
Like you launch a note in a bottle on
the ocean and you have no idea where it's

32
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:50,824
going to end up.

33
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:55,930
And so that was the first interesting
manifestation of those rules outside of

34
00:01:55,931 --> 00:02:00,190
the Kora containers, so to
speak. And then of course,

35
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,430
part of our discussion about the rules
also led to their encapsulation in 12

36
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:08,170
rules for life.
And that was much later.

37
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,250
And it's been interesting to see how
that overlap has developed as well.

38
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,140
Well it's also weird to see what
connects, like, it's so funny with,

39
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,120
with orphan acts when
I was first adapting.

40
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:22,170
And the big thing with that is that
my character kind of interacts.

41
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,170
He's an archetypal character,
like a Jack reacher Jason Bourne,

42
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:28,380
but lives in the real world with you
and me. You know, so it's like he's not,

43
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,970
you never see James Bond go home.

44
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,360
Just what an architectural
character should do. Right.

45
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,180
It should exist in abstraction and
also be embedded in the real world.

46
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:36,391
Yeah.

47
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:39,960
But usually you have like the high
plains drifter who's like all feeding his

48
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:41,880
horse and like moving on to the next town.

49
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:44,640
So I thought it'd be so fun to have
them like interacting with the annoying

50
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:48,780
Jewish woman who lives upstairs and
having an awkward confrontation with the

51
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:51,090
woman who lives downstairs
who has chemistry with.

52
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:53,700
So it's an archetypal character
wrestled into the real world.

53
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,640
That's what the Spiderman
people did really well.

54
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:57,470
The marvel when exactly ended Spiderman

55
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,580
that extraordinarily well.
He has to like re stitch is Costa.

56
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,050
But no one thought about that,
you know,

57
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:06,070
and he's like late for school and
all those problems. Exactly, exactly.

58
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:09,320
So that was, that was
sort of the motif. Um,

59
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,340
well that is also the problem of,
of it's,

60
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,570
it's a more complex
psychological problem of,

61
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:19,790
of integrating the archetipal with the
real world because there's an element of

62
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:23,380
everyone's psyche that's, that's
transpersonal. That's archetipal right?

63
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,170
Because to some degree you should manifest
the mythological hero in your life,

64
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,360
but the critical issue there
is in your life, right?

65
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,690
Because your life is like your
life is like the, the bottle that,

66
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,440
or the lamp that the genie is in.

67
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,860
It's like the genie is God
for all intents and purposes,

68
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,260
but it's in this little tiny container.
It's like,

69
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:45,320
well that's what you're like because
you have this archetipal element to your

70
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,500
personality, which is your
capacity for heroic endeavor,

71
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,680
but it's all constrained
by the hypothetical or the
trivialities of your life.

72
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,030
And you have to have to
mediate between those.

73
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,130
Well, and that's the weird
thing. Like you were saying,

74
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,620
one of the things when you write is
you don't always know what's going to

75
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:04,280
connect. Right? You never knew that
those rules would become, you know,

76
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,100
number one bestselling book
everywhere in the world.

77
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,520
What was so interesting is there's this
one scene at the opening of orphan acts

78
00:04:10,521 --> 00:04:13,520
where he's in the elevator
and he's got a cut on his arm.

79
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:14,360
We don't know what it's from,

80
00:04:14,361 --> 00:04:18,020
and he has to fake to kind of pass as
a real person among all the people.

81
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:19,130
And he's kind of covering it up.

82
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:22,430
But he's got suppressors and he
used the SOC as a tourniquet.

83
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:26,640
So he's missing a sock and he's kind of
trying to pass his secret identity among

84
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:31,370
other people that seen connected
unbelievably with readers with.

85
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,920
And it would, it would be like the
last scene that I would have thought.

86
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,120
And when I adapted the book initially
for Bradley Cooper as a feature,

87
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:40,340
and I remember I was like,
well if I have Bradley Cooper,

88
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,700
let me open with some big
action is show off offy thing.

89
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,840
And both his production company and
the head of the studio were like,

90
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:51,920
we need the elevator saying like this
elevator scene became the iconic thing.

91
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:53,420
Of course.
Cause it does what you're talking.

92
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:56,550
There shouldn't be some music playing in
the back of the exactly. Like there is.

93
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

94
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,380
So from Ipanema there's something awful
if you get caught between the mirror and

95
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:03,400
in New York City. Right, right.

96
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,100
But it's weird because I never would've
thought that would be the thing.

97
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,350
So the stuff that you send out,

98
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,980
do you have any idea why that
was so attractive to people?

99
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,070
Well,
I think it's exactly,

100
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:16,360
the thing that we were talking about is
like you don't see James Bond in that

101
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:20,170
circumstance. It's so it's like
this archetype guy has a mission,

102
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:22,210
is a knife cut that he
tourniquets is armed with.

103
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:25,450
And then he's in the elevator that you
and I have been in and everyone's nagging

104
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:28,000
him that he's missed the Hoa meeting,

105
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:31,270
the Homeowner's association meeting
where they're voting on like the new

106
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:34,780
carpeting in the lobby and he's just
trying to get out of it and he's covering.

107
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:37,780
So there's this wish fulfillment
fantasy aspect to it,

108
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,340
but it's almost like our own lives and
like everyone knows what it's like to be

109
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,590
dealing with annoyances and logistics,

110
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,190
but then he gets to go back to his life
is like a super secret assassin who

111
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:48,930
helps the helper.

112
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,070
Well, there's another element of it too,
I would say, which is that, that, that,

113
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,720
that scene and,
and that,

114
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,540
that context also suggests
that one of the ways that you,

115
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,860
one of the things that you have to do
in order to put up with those mundane

116
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:08,390
daily elements of life is also to have
your adventure along with you. Right.

117
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,621
So,
and I mean,

118
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:13,220
one of the things that I've been talking
to my audiences about continually is

119
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:18,221
that you need to have a meaning in your
life that's of sufficient grandier let's

120
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:18,891
say,

121
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:23,891
or a sufficient power so that the petty
sufferings of life become not only

122
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:27,500
justifiable, but acceptable
in the broader context and so,

123
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,860
and sufficient risk and sufficient risk.
Because while that and that,

124
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:32,930
and that's what puts the
adventure into it, right?

125
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,240
It's like in the elevator scene,
it's,

126
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,300
it's not only that everyone
can relate to the mundane,

127
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:42,950
it's also that everyone can see that
what transcends the mundane is also

128
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:46,520
fundamentally necessary because otherwise
you are nothing but a collection of

129
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:47,840
trivialities and,

130
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,560
and life has so much suffering that if
you're just a collection of trivialities,

131
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:54,830
you're not going to be able to bear it.
So you need your heroic adventure,

132
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,020
which is what's animating you.
Literally Anima is the soul, right?

133
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:01,070
That's what Adam a means.

134
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,460
So that's literally animating you while
you have to put up with being trapped in

135
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:05,530
this little tiny fire.

136
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,230
I thought about this a lot
when I was writing Batman.

137
00:07:08,231 --> 00:07:12,840
I wrote Batman for two years for DC and
I was fascinated by the sort of seesaw

138
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,140
tilt between perfection and intimacy,
which is so Batman, you know,

139
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:19,000
he doesn't have a magic ring,
he can't fly.

140
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:22,060
He just represents the pinnacle of
human discipline and achievement.

141
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:26,230
It's because his parents died when he was
young, right? He's alone in Wayne Manor.

142
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,980
There's, Robin always dies, there's always
a Robin and he dies. He's a playboy.

143
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:32,440
He doesn't have anyone intimate.
And if there's no one in your life,

144
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:36,400
you can maintain perfection.
But the more you inch into intimacy,

145
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,820
a dog, a spouse, a partner, children,

146
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:44,260
the more that you get
this sort of conflict and
complication that starts to take

147
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:46,540
over and detract from that
version of perfection.

148
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,490
So it's like you can be
perfect without intimacy,

149
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:50,710
but then you're not perfect
cause you have no intimacy.

150
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,610
And so the more that you integrated,

151
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,150
it's almost like the more that you're
accepting the realities of life.

152
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,021
And there's also,

153
00:07:56,021 --> 00:07:59,080
I think it's also one of the things
that's interesting in the Batman reference

154
00:07:59,081 --> 00:08:02,980
because one of the things you
see in the Batman Joker dynamic,

155
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:04,600
especially the one with
Heath Heath Ledger,

156
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:08,740
was the joker was always pushing at
Batman because of the evil of his

157
00:08:08,741 --> 00:08:12,880
perfections. Like you're this far away
from me. And that perfectionistic drive,

158
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:16,090
there's something totalitarian
and single minded about it, right?

159
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:20,470
And then it's the encapsulation of that
in intimacy that that humanizes it and

160
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,090
produce it sane. Right? And so, so that
unit, dimensional perfection can go very,

161
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:26,560
very badly when it goes.

162
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,800
And to be contextually constrained like
that is actually like a definition of

163
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,430
sanity.

164
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:34,100
It's something that young talked about
when he was commenting on nature and

165
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,040
people liked nature.

166
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,680
I said he believed that nature would
have been able to maintain his sanity for

167
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:39,460
much longer,

168
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,290
assuming no physiological degeneration
had he been able to incorporate himself

169
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,270
within a profession and a family.

170
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,560
That's your nailed them to the
earth and inhale way stilts down.

171
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:52,150
And that's right.
That's exactly right.

172
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,450
So I thought we'd just talk briefly
about the editing process for 12 roles.

173
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,250
It was a lot of fun because I got to read
it all early, which was, which was fun.

174
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:06,290
So I had it featured in the orphan x
books like two years before it came out.

175
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:06,480
Right.

176
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,270
Which is why I always like to remind
you that I'm mostly responsible for your

177
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:09,860
six hours.

178
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,850
I do appreciate that a lot. Well,
I sent all the chapters to Greg.

179
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,610
I had an editor at Penguin, Craig
Piot, who was very, very helpful.

180
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,550
So I had two editors really,
and other people commenting on it.

181
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:23,060
But I sent each chapter to Greg and
he would just shred them. He's really,

182
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:25,640
really good at that and
well and very comical.

183
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:28,550
And so he'd just be absolutely brutal.
It is criticisms,

184
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:32,930
but it was also also always
extremely funny. Yeah. Well,

185
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:36,410
and then I was also absolutely staggered
by how rapidly you could do that and,

186
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,530
and to point to what was working in,
to tell me what was working.

187
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:42,970
And so that was exceptionally helpful
in your very, very skilled at that. So,

188
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,040
so there's the compliment
you're gonna get from me.

189
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,920
No, it was, it was, it was very
helpful. Now the insult first you lead,

190
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,160
you softened me up with a
compliment and now you know,

191
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,760
but I think what was helpful is,
so,

192
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,430
I mean I took three courses
from you as an undergraduate.

193
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,820
So it's like we've been swimming
in the same waters for a long time.

194
00:09:57,821 --> 00:10:02,350
So it was really interesting for me
to see, you know, through the process.

195
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,480
Um, you know, I have a,

196
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:07,450
I have a sense that goes kind of all
the way down of the ideas you're running

197
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:09,730
with going back to before maps of meaning,
right?

198
00:10:09,731 --> 00:10:13,480
Going back to the source book articles
and stuff, you lectured amount.

199
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:18,010
So it was really fun to see them take
hold and move from the abstract into the

200
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,880
ever more accessible.
And

201
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,880
the setback was useful too because you're,
you're,

202
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:25,000
you've developed this intense skill in,

203
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:30,110
in producing commercial widely,
publicly accessible fiction and,

204
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,430
and you have a sense of what
works in terms of narrative flow.

205
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,810
And that was very useful to have
that perspective on the way the, the,

206
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,230
the stories were laid out in,
in each of the rules to make them,

207
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,850
to give them that narrative punch,

208
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:48,050
which is necessary to add an additional
dimension of, what would you say?

209
00:10:48,051 --> 00:10:49,160
Quality to the writing.

210
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,860
It's helpful. I'm glad, but it's, it's
good working with someone with like,

211
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,420
your learning curve was like this.

212
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,440
So it was like the first one
that we went through, you know,

213
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:02,160
if there was something that has the speed
with which you can sort of implement

214
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,430
some white new information and, and
reflect that in writing is unbelievable.

215
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,230
That's fun.

216
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,670
Or there's a benefit of being sort of
experienced in multiple dominant Tarik is

217
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,880
I think because there's so many things
that you've done at such a high level

218
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:17,520
that when you add a new one,
the learning curve is like this.

219
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,650
So it was also really fun
because it's like, you know,

220
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,290
well, we'll have a chance to
do it again. Yeah. All right.

221
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,300
Expect when I write the next book because
there may be an extension of 12 rules

222
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:27,230
for life,
I presume.

223
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,240
So it's fun bumping into you here cause
we just bumped into each other at the

224
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:31,074
studio today.

225
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,650
Yeah, halfway around the world and
one studio apart. But so that's great.

226
00:11:35,651 --> 00:11:38,590
So we'll work on the next one and I'll
work on the next orphaned acts and we'll

227
00:11:38,591 --> 00:11:39,424
go from there.

228
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,330
All right, good to see you, man.
