1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,480
I'm Dr. Jordan B.
Peterson,

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,960
a psychology professor at the University
of Toronto in Canada.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,190
I'm going to tell you the story behind 
the self authoring suite website.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,553
A few years ago I realized that the 
students in my classes had written 

5
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:19,540
essays on all sorts of subjects in grade
school and college.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,063
However,
they'd never been asked to write 

7
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:26,470
thoughtfully about themselves,
about their own past experiences,

8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,350
personalities,
and visions for their futures.

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,020
Upon reflection,
just lack of opportunity.

10
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:33,854
He struck me as strange to say the least
since there's nothing more important to 

11
00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:40,240
get straight than your own personal 
experience.

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:42,923
At the same time,
I was speaking with managers at various 

13
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:46,920
companies about how to hire more 
effective workers.

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,863
They were much more interested in how to
improve the performance of poorly 

15
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:53,100
performing people they had already 
hired.

16
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,523
I didn't have much to tell them at the 
time because improving people is very 

17
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,900
difficult.
Nonetheless,

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,610
the two problems stuck in my mind,

19
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,483
so I started to search for psychological
interventions that could be used widely 

20
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:11,880
and practically to clarify and improve 
people's lives.

21
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,233
I already knew that people lived inside 
the stories they told about themselves 

22
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,340
and that they use those stories to 
interpret everything around them.

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,280
Well,
considering this,

24
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,143
I came up on Dr. James Pennebaker's 
research conducted at the University of 

25
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:28,704
Texas at Austin.
Dr Pennebaker tested Sigmund Freud's 

26
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:32,754
theory that the release of emotions 
related to traumatic events could be 

27
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:39,780
curative.
He had his students write for three days

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,250
for 15 minutes a day about the most 
upsetting experiences of their lives.

29
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,030
While the control group wrote about 
ordinary daily activities,

30
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,213
those in the former group experience 
longterm improvements in their 

31
00:01:53,221 --> 00:01:56,700
psychological and physical health after 
a brief dip in mood,

32
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,600
not so much because of the expression of
pent up feelings,

33
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:01,434
however,
but because they drew more specific 

34
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:07,080
causal conclusions about what had 
happened to them in the past.

35
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,843
Dr. Laura King had her subjects right 
about their ideals and future goals 

36
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,730
instead that they experienced the same 
benefits.

37
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,493
Our research team specifically tested 
the effects of the future authoring 

38
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:21,900
program.
Part of the self authoring suite related

39
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:24,900
to goal setting have mcgill university 
in Montreal,

40
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,080
Canada,
and the Rasmus University in Rotterdam.

41
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,183
It academically struggling.
Miguel students increased their grades 

42
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:38,181
by 25% in one year and decrease their 
dropout rates from 30% to zero.

43
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,213
The same thing happened at Erasmus 
University with more than 1200 business 

44
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,264
students.
These affects you not just apply to 

45
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:50,760
students either.
Dr. Frank Smith,

46
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,440
one of the world's outstanding 
industrial psychologists as demonstrated

47
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,603
that participating in such programs 
makes all kinds of people substantially 

48
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:02,290
more effective or whatever they are 
doing.

49
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:04,923
People who complete sex programs appear 
to benefit because the careful 

50
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:08,764
articulation of their experiences past,
present and future decreases misery 

51
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,673
related to threat and uncertainty and 
increases happiness and hope which 

52
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:22,210
people experience when they progressed 
towards somewhere they truly want to be.

53
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,620
When complicated experiences are 
carefully put into words,

54
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,040
the manner in which they are represented
in the brain changes.

55
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,713
They moved from the areas associated 
with stressfully motion demanding 

56
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:35,794
constant physical readiness to the areas
associated with detailed comprehension 

57
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:40,414
and understanding just makes articulate 
people less stressed and more informed 

58
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:48,370
about how to be successful now and in 
the future.

59
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,450
It is for these reasons that we 
developed a self authoring suite,

60
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,790
a set of four interactive online writing
programs and are offering them to anyone

61
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,670
who wants to concentrate on improving 
his or her life.

62
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,740
If you want to understand yourself 
better,

63
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,413
become less anxious and happier and 
commit yourself more firmly to your 

64
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:11,790
education,
career or your relationships,

65
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,283
these programs will help a lot.
Each of the programs is composed of a 

66
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:18,864
series of interactive web pages,
the present you a specific personal 

67
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:25,020
questions.
This simplifies and guides the difficult

68
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:25,854
process of personal writing.
Each program requires careful thought 

69
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:30,863
and take several hours to complete.
It is better to write over a number of 

70
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,270
days so that you have time to think and 
because sleep aids the process,

71
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,303
the writing is challenging,
but the experimentally documented 

72
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:45,570
benefits are worth it.

73
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,510
The past authoring program helps you 
write an autobiography.

74
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,510
It will present you with pages like 
this,

75
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,733
introducing you to the program
and providing psychologically sound 

76
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:04,031
advice and information.
It will then ask you to start writing,

77
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,760
dividing your life into seven eip,
pocs or sections,

78
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,620
and describing the important experiences
of each the to present.

79
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:16,050
All three programs help you address your
personality,

80
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:21,051
faults and capitalize on your virtues.
When you start either of these programs,

81
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,850
you will also be presented with 
instruction pages.

82
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,760
Then you'll be provided with a list of 
adjectives,

83
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:27,923
some of which will accurately define you
and be asked to select six to nine 

84
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,933
describing your faults.
If you're feeling up to a challenge or 

85
00:05:36,331 --> 00:05:38,790
your virtues,
if you could use a boost,

86
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,123
he will then be asked to rank order 
these adjectives and to write a 

87
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:47,490
paragraph describing a time when each 
had a specific effect on your life.

88
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,983
The future authoring program helps you 
define the future that would work best 

89
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,660
for you three to five years down the 
road,

90
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,420
and just as importantly to describe the 
future you want to avoid.

91
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,423
It starts with some questions like these
which will start you thinking in the 

92
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:05,054
right direction.

93
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,253
Then it will ask you to write freely 
about what you want and don't want and 

94
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:22,220
about how to justify your decisions and 
stay on the right track.

95
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,290
The programs contain much more detailed 
than this brief summary Presents.

96
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,670
Here are the sorts of additional 
questions you will be asked to consider.

97
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,300
What were your 10 most important 
experiences?

98
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,793
Were they positive or negative?
How did each experience change you or 

99
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:41,384
your view of other people?
Were there things that you should have 

100
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:48,080
done differently?
Are you the life of the party?

101
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,820
Do you feel comfortable around people?
Do you think before you act?

102
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,050
Are you full of ideas?
Are you a sensible person?

103
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,170
Do you do things according to a plan?
Are you too quiet around strangers?

104
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,660
Do you daydream too much?

105
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,350
What is one thing that you could do 
better?

106
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,413
What do you want to learn about?
How should you handle your drinking or 

107
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:19,490
drug use?
Describe your ideal social life.

108
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,560
You may choose to complete any or all of
the four programs.

109
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,713
You'll be given a confidential user name
and account password and your writing 

110
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:37,010
will be securely stored.
Once you have completed each program,

111
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,083
you'll receive an organized 
comprehensive email laying out the work 

112
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,044
that you have done.
You can return to the programs in the 

113
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,464
future to edit and update your work.
Many people do not understand who they 

114
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:52,910
are,
where they are,

115
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,150
or where they are going.
In consequence,

116
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,283
instead of attempting those actions that
would make their lives as valuable as 

117
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:03,680
possible,
things just happened to them and they're

118
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:07,880
often not good
carefully answering all the questions in

119
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:09,950
the self authoring suite in your own 
words,

120
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,270
we'll clear the fog from your vision,
make you healthier and stronger,

121
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,190
and increased the chances that you will 
exist in a manner that justifies all the

122
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:20,024
trouble that life inevitably presents.
This will help you be a good person for 

123
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:29,471
yourself and for other people.
Carve yourself a new and better you.

124
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:32,743
There's no sense slouching around 
miserably when you can aim for what you 

125
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:40,370
should have and get it.
Good luck with the programs.
