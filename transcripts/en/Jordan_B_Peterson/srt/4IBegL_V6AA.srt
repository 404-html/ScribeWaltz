1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,590
I'm here today in Manhattan talking to 
Dr Jonathan Heit,

2
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,680
who's a professor at Nyu and uh,
I'm here for a bunch of reasons.

3
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,350
Jonathan is an extremely interesting 
researcher.

4
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,650
I've been following his work on disgust 
and political belief for literally for 

5
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,641
decades.
He was one of the first people who 

6
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:35,641
started to do serious research on 
disgust,

7
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:38,280
which is its own emotional system and 
therefore very much worth attending to,

8
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,710
um,
but we also have some other interests in

9
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:42,370
common.
Uh,

10
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,120
Jonathan also started this institute 
called the Heterodox Academy,

11
00:00:46,121 --> 00:00:50,830
which is attempting to bring back a 
reasonable diversity of views or what he

12
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:55,831
regards as a reasonable diversity of 
views to university faculty on campuses 

13
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:56,710
and discussion.
So,

14
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,990
um,
I first met Jonathan.

15
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,500
It's going to be just about 30 years 
ago.

16
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,060
Twenty five years ago.

17
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,710
20 14?
Yeah.

18
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:07,780
20 site.
The 1994.

19
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,990
Oh,
it was in 1994.

20
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,480
Yeah.
Yeah,

21
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:10,160
right,
right.

22
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:12,800
So yeah,
you came to do a job talk at Harvard too

23
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,950
for an assistant professorship position 
and I'd been aware of your work on 

24
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,611
disgust then and,
and agitated hard for them to hire you 

25
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:22,220
because I thought it was of great 
significance,

26
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:25,700
which turned out to be exactly the case.
So what do you remember about that?

27
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,730
I remember I was so excited to have an 
interview at Harvard.

28
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:31,220
It was my only interview.
I didn't get that job.

29
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:36,221
I had no job for the following year and 
it was a very strange day in which I 

30
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:39,290
didn't feel particularly welcome or 
wanted.

31
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:44,291
And then I had my session with you in 
which he was this guy who was had,

32
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,130
he actually got a job at Harvard and he 
was studying young,

33
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:54,131
which is like almost taboo.
And he was talking about dreams and 

34
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:55,940
creativity and so I just.
That was the really bright.

35
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:59,450
That was the bright memory of the day 
was our hour long conversation.

36
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,000
Yeah.
Well I was also really interested at the

37
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:02,540
time,
man,

38
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:05,300
now in,
in the biological basis of behavior.

39
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,050
Right.
And so,

40
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:06,950
and,
and in the,

41
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,480
in the,
in the relationship between fundamental 

42
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,041
motivational systems and thought because
obviously our thought is grounded in 

43
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,930
fundamental motivational systems and 
your work on disgust,

44
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:19,940
which maybe you can tell the viewers a 
little bit about,

45
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,360
was really interesting to me because it 
was an emotional system that

46
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,200
hadn't been studied much.
I mean,

47
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:30,201
you were really one of the pioneers in 
the psychological study of discuss what 

48
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:34,180
other way to explain it is that Paul 
Ross and my advisor at Penn is the 

49
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,911
pioneer in this study of disgust and 
he'd studied it as a food related 

50
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:38,940
emotion and he'd written a bit about it 
being a moral emotion.

51
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,390
And I was a graduate student at Penn and
I was interested in morality and I was 

52
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:47,980
reading the Bible and I was reading,
um,

53
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:53,050
uh,
anthropological accounts of different 

54
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,891
countries and different cultures.
And at the time morality was all about 

55
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:58,970
reasoning about harm rights and justice.
So Lawrence Kohlberg was the leading 

56
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,410
figure in the field and because I was 
looking at morality cross cultures,

57
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,930
uh,
and when you look across cultures,

58
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:07,450
it's not just about fairness and harmon 
rights.

59
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:12,451
It's about menstruation and food taboos 
and skin lesions and it's very physical 

60
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:13,990
and I was,
you know,

61
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:14,560
why?

62
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,000
Why does so many societies,
why is it like the normal default way of

63
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:21,250
being is to somehow bring the body into 
morality?

64
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:26,251
Why is that?
And so I just happened to be at Penn 

65
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:29,011
where the world's expert in disgust was 
and I went to talk to them and that 

66
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,040
started one of the best collaborations 
of my life.

67
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,400
And what it led to is,
is a broadening of the,

68
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,930
of the moral domain.
Basically there's a sort of a western,

69
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,380
a secular approach you see in western 
philosophers.

70
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,750
Either morality is about harm and 
utilitarianism and it's minimize harm or

71
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:48,900
it's about rights and principles,
you know,

72
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,940
manual con and a much better way 
psychologically I think about morality 

73
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,900
is virtue ethics.
It's just a lot of stuff.

74
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,930
It's just we have just a lot of stuff 
that we judge on and this led me 

75
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,501
eventually to realize that people on the
left and people on the right care about 

76
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,200
different stuff.

77
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,410
Everybody cares about harm and fairness,
but the stuff about keeping boundaries 

78
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:13,020
around the group,
build a wall,

79
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,730
protect the group,
hold the group together,

80
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,370
hate traders.
Um,

81
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,730
you know,
everybody can do that,

82
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,910
but right wing morality builds on these 
additional additional foundations of 

83
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,280
these additional motions and foundations
so that work on disgust that I was just 

84
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,451
beginning to talk about them when we 
first met in 1994 lead eventually to 

85
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:35,550
what we now call moral foundations 
theory and with my,

86
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,370
with that five or six colleagues that if
you go to your morals.org,

87
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,990
uh,
you can take our tests,

88
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:42,810
you can learn all about it.
Um,

89
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,690
but it led to the perspective that 
ultimately was,

90
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,940
I think the right perspective as the 
cultural war was heating up and as left 

91
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,991
and right,
we're essentially becoming like 

92
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:54,991
different countries,
different cultures.

93
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:59,550
So,
so it's not obvious on first 

94
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,670
consideration why discussed would be a 
moral emotion.

95
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,700
So you know,
most of the work that's done that's 

96
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,761
outside of the disgust realm,
I would say is predicated on the 

97
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:11,090
assumption that the reason that 
conservatives in particular,

98
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:16,091
but perhaps people who are more 
authoritarian and general draw 

99
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:18,950
boundaries around their territories 
because they're afraid of the other,

100
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,250
but that isn't really,
that isn't really how it plays out as 

101
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:24,250
far as I can tell,
because conservatives,

102
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,901
for example,
are less neurotic than treat in the big 

103
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:28,901
five traits sense than liberals,
although it's a,

104
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:33,450
it's a minor difference,
but the disgust issue seems to be 

105
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:33,450
particularly relevant.
So.

106
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,890
So can you tell us a little bit about 
why disgust per se?

107
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,620
Well,
conservatives are a little less 

108
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:42,620
neurotic,
but they also add,

109
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,730
if you do very low level perceptual 
experiments,

110
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:46,500
just like a puff of white noise in the 
ear.

111
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,120
People who react more strongly to that 
to any sort of very low level threat are

112
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:53,190
more likely to vote Republican in this 
country.

113
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:53,910
So they're there.
You know,

114
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:58,911
there are all these interesting 
personality differences that lead to 

115
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:58,911
different.
But as for why discussed,

116
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,460
um,
so I'm,

117
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,260
I'm a Durkheimian,
I would say I love the,

118
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,660
uh,
the sociologists,

119
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:07,700
Emile Durkheim,
and I'm also,

120
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:12,750
I'm a social psychologist,
so I'm always thinking not about people 

121
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,590
as individual utility maximizers,
but people as members of social groups,

122
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,800
people who are totally focused on 
belonging in their social groups and 

123
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,680
people who have some pro social motives 
about keeping the group together,

124
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,360
about doing things that are good for the
group.

125
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:29,480
So as I tried to argue in my book,
the righteous mind,

126
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,920
yes,
we're selfish.

127
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,920
There's no doubt that we often will do 
things to advance our own self interest 

128
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,690
at the expense of others.
But we're also really groupish,

129
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,930
which means we'll do all sorts of things
to advance our group at the expense of 

130
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,060
others.
Basically,

131
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:48,080
we're tribal.
We evolved as a tribal species and we're

132
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:50,390
doing,
we have all this software.

133
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:50,840
I would say,
oh,

134
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,030
this,
all these predispositions,

135
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:55,700
these mental predispositions for life 
in,

136
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,400
in tribes that are battling other 
tribes.

137
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,520
And that's why it comes out so easily.
If you look at the way boys organized 

138
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,260
themselves when they get a fraternity,
um,

139
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,490
the hazing rituals,
when you look at the weights,

140
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,650
especially clear in boys the way street 
gangs organized themselves,

141
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:11,030
girls,
tribalism is a little different.

142
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,390
Um,
but I would say this,

143
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,480
and that's why,
again,

144
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:16,880
I love the [inaudible] and approach of 
archetypes or something.

145
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,520
There's just this weird stuff that is 
pan human,

146
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,430
even if it comes out slightly 
differently around the world,

147
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,580
there really is a human nature and it 
comes complete with a whole bunch of 

148
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:27,580
like,
predesigned idea.

149
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,500
So there was a new article,
I think it was published in nature.

150
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:32,660
I'll try to find the link for it is 
about a year old,

151
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,870
um,
that,

152
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,480
that was based on high resolution 
imaging of neuronal connections.

153
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,570
It's actually reviewed and Kurt Selles 
Kurzweil's book,

154
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,610
how to build a mind.
I think that's the name of it.

155
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:49,010
Um,
and so it turns out that the Cortex is 

156
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,341
made out of these columnar structures 
that are pre-organized units of neurons 

157
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:53,550
and they're replicated across the entire
cortex.

158
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,360
Basically the same structure.
And like the,

159
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,130
the,
the older,

160
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:03,131
let's say connectionist idea was that 
neurons that fire together wire 

161
00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:03,131
together,
right?

162
00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:07,691
That that's happened.
And of course that's pretty standard 

163
00:08:07,691 --> 00:08:08,180
neurology,
but the columns are already prewired.

164
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,430
So it's actually columns that fire 
together,

165
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,630
wire together,
but there's,

166
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,030
but there's even more with the high 
resolution scanning.

167
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,690
So it turns out that underneath the 
columnar structure,

168
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:21,260
there are these prebuilt highways that 
are connected,

169
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,380
connective tissue that are pre,
pre prepared.

170
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,890
So the columns have the option to 
connect to the,

171
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:32,950
to the underlying highway,
and that highway can connect other 

172
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,831
columns.
So it's as if in implicit in the brain 

173
00:08:35,831 --> 00:08:36,320
organization,
and this is at the cortical level,

174
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:40,550
say nothing of subcortical organization,
there's already preexistent,

175
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,050
uh,
uh,

176
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,740
likelihoods that certain neurons will 
fire wire together.

177
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,370
Yeah.
So,

178
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:51,371
and,
and what else is cool is that this is 

179
00:08:51,371 --> 00:08:52,850
actually architecturally quite a 
regular.

180
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:58,060
So they found that the,
these superhighways arranged in lines 

181
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,060
and,
and,

182
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,710
and,
and in,

183
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:04,430
at right angles to one another.
So it's almost like a three dimensional 

184
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,760
structure of why your cubes that 
underlies the neuronal structure.

185
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,370
So that's a neurological evidence for 
the architects.

186
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,370
Cool idea.
Let me just explain to explain to the 

187
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,730
viewers here why this isn't just some 
like psychological geek conversation.

188
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
This is actually really relevant to a 
lot of the things that we'll be talking 

189
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,821
about that your audience product cares 
about because one of the most contested 

190
00:09:22,821 --> 00:09:26,661
ideas and the social sciences is the 
idea of uniqueness and the idea is what 

191
00:09:26,661 --> 00:09:28,500
if something has a need,
then it can't.

192
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,730
It can't vary across societies and if it
varies across societies then it's not an

193
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:36,950
eight and if gender varies,
if masculinity or femininity vary across

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,690
society is not innate,
it's socially constructed,

195
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,600
but that's the wrong understanding of 
maintenance.

196
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,970
The definition that I use comes from 
Gary.

197
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:46,890
Marcus was actually neuroscientist here 
at Nyu.

198
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:51,891
He says innate doesn't mean hardwired.
There's almost nothing interesting 

199
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:55,581
that's hardwired.
Innate means structured in advance of 

200
00:09:55,581 --> 00:09:58,971
experience,
but that experience can still revise it 

201
00:09:58,971 --> 00:10:01,110
and boy does that work for gender,
for almost everything,

202
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,400
for almost everything that we're not a 
blank slate about anything.

203
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,360
And something I used to tell my students
at Uva I taught at Uva for 16 years is,

204
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,600
you know,
everything's a social construction,

205
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,880
masculinity,
femininity,

206
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,370
cancer,
the sun,

207
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,900
death,
everything.

208
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:24,020
There's a social construction for you 
won't find a society that doesn't have 

209
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,051
thoughts about these things,
but the fact that societies have social 

210
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:31,311
constructions tells us nothing about 
whether there's not also an underlying 

211
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:33,650
biological reality and in almost all 
cases there.

212
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,700
Well otherwise we wouldn't be able to 
communicate,

213
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,220
which is one of Eo Wilson's comments 
right?

214
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,360
When Wilson,
this,

215
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:42,990
the entomologist who studied dance at 
Harvard and also wrote a number of books

216
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:45,960
about sociobiology that got him in 
trouble with the radical leftists.

217
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:48,690
And he said even if we could communicate
with ants,

218
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:53,691
there'd be nothing to say to each other 
because they're fundamental mode of 

219
00:10:53,691 --> 00:10:57,560
being in the world is based on 
motivations and interests that are so 

220
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,500
different from ours.
That there wouldn't be any structure for

221
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:03,501
communication.
And you can kind of tell that with 

222
00:11:03,501 --> 00:11:03,501
regards to the animals that we make 
friends with,

223
00:11:03,501 --> 00:11:08,301
right?
We're much more likely to make friends 

224
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:08,940
with animals who has a who have a 
fundamental biological and social nature

225
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:13,941
that's very close to ours like dogs 
because we can basically speak their 

226
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:14,550
language even though not completely

227
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,980
a mammo language of love and you know,
I miss you and I want to play with you.

228
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,790
Yeah,
that's right.

229
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:20,470
Yeah,
exactly.

230
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,250
And that bonding.
Okay,

231
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,750
so back to discuss,
back to discuss.

232
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:29,050
So I'm.
So the fundamental thing that I learned 

233
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,770
from Paul Rosin is to see us as these 
amazing omnivores.

234
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,430
This is part of our survival strategy 
even more than other other apes.

235
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,480
We are just brilliant omnivores and we 
have the Omnivore's dilemma,

236
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,900
which is we've got to be interested in 
all kinds of new stuff.

237
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,710
We're not tied to one place.
We can roam onto a whole new continent.

238
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,280
So we were interested in stuff,
but stuff has all kinds of toxins and 

239
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,880
microbes.
We have to be careful about that.

240
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:58,170
And so these motives have to be 
intention and this is actually an 

241
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:58,170
interesting way to understand the left,
right?

242
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,890
Difference.
You have to have both motives,

243
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,350
but if so,
imagine two siblings,

244
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,380
one of whom is set more towards trying 
new stuff,

245
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:07,900
seeking out new stuff,
and the other is a little more fearful.

246
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,590
And we're like,
Whoa,

247
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:09,370
no,
let's,

248
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,690
you know,
let's not try that.

249
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,880
That stayed with what's tried and true.
I mean,

250
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:15,280
that's progressivism and conservatives 
and that's the origins of it.

251
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,640
And if you look at kids' behavior at the
age of two or three,

252
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,400
it does predict how they'll vote much 
later.

253
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,160
Not Hugely,
but there is a clear prediction there.

254
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,160
So,
um,

255
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,750
so disgust is part of a regulatory 
system about our engagement with the 

256
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,550
world and whether we are just sorta out 
there and,

257
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,320
you know,
we,

258
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,130
we,
we seek out variety and diversity.

259
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:41,131
We think diversity is just a great thing
or whether we want a little more order 

260
00:12:41,131 --> 00:12:41,131
structure,
predictability.

261
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:46,530
Conservatives are neater than a 
progressive's if you take photos of 

262
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:46,820
their rooms,
um,

263
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,610
um,
you know,

264
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:51,310
you can actually cleanliness and 
organization,

265
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:53,830
you can predict how they vote,
um,

266
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:59,340
discussed.
It turns out what's really cool about 

267
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,651
disgust in modern politics is if you 
look at all the different things that 

268
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:01,960
we're fighting over,
especially in this country,

269
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:03,730
our culture war is over,
you know,

270
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,320
going back in a few decades,
you know,

271
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,490
sex,
drugs,

272
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:07,810
the flag,
immigration,

273
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:08,470
all of these things.

274
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,930
Um,
I had to study with my colleagues.

275
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:15,931
It was led by Seneca Leyva in which we 
asked all these cultural war attitudes 

276
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,570
of people and we also had their scores 
and the discus scale,

277
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,750
but one of the foundations of morality 
is sanctity and purity.

278
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,690
And it relates to discuss.
What we found is that if,

279
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:27,490
you know,
if you know,

280
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,820
um,
uh,

281
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,280
what people's left,
right?

282
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,320
We're,
how they place themselves in the left 

283
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,631
rightscale you can pretty much predict 
where they fall on most culture war 

284
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:40,750
attitudes except for those that load on 
or implicate sanctity,

285
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,770
purity.
So what I mean,

286
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:43,570
his flag burning.
Okay.

287
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:44,270
Do you think,
you know,

288
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:49,290
do you think that people should have the
right to burn the American flag or the 

289
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,200
country's flag as an expression,
as a political action?

290
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:55,201
What do you think people can give some 
answer on a one to seven scale and 

291
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,140
people on the right thing,
you know,

292
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,590
more like this.

293
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,120
Ain't no people in the left.
Yes.

294
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,110
People who score high on loyalty are 
more likely to say no.

295
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:07,140
People who low lower and say yes,
and that's even taking account of where 

296
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,140
they are on the left,
right dimension.

297
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,430
But here's the cool thing,
um,

298
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:13,890
it's only if you add in the purity or 
sanctity thing that you can really 

299
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,951
understand what people are doing because
some people see the flag not as just a 

300
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:22,561
piece of cloth.
They see it as having some innate 

301
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,661
essence,
some something sacred about it which 

302
00:14:24,661 --> 00:14:24,661
must be protected.
And so,

303
00:14:24,661 --> 00:14:25,390
um,
so this is true.

304
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:27,370
Even they think of it as a unifying 
center.

305
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,840
Exactly.
That's right.

306
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,650
So if there's something sacred,
and this is the,

307
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:35,670
this is the central piece of my work 
around politics and morality is the 

308
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,710
psychology of sanctity.
If you hold something sacred,

309
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,040
then your team's circles around it.
And it's only those who circle around 

310
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,770
with you and sometimes literally circled
around like Muslims at prayer in Mecca.

311
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:51,100
They literally circle the Kebab circling
is a very primitive,

312
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,390
ancient.
It feels right to circle something,

313
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,810
but even if even if you do it 
symbolically or you all bow at the same 

314
00:14:58,810 --> 00:14:58,810
time that binds you together,

315
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,580
children do that with their mothers when
they,

316
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,100
when they engage in exploratory 
behavior,

317
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:08,101
right where all they used their mother 
as a center of the world and children 

318
00:15:08,101 --> 00:15:09,580
differ in the degree to which they'll 
move outward from their mother.

319
00:15:09,581 --> 00:15:12,320
So they move out until they,
they,

320
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,040
they trip over their,
their uncertainty threshold.

321
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,870
Neat.
And is it a distance,

322
00:15:16,871 --> 00:15:18,070
like it's a district?
Yeah.

323
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,030
Yeah.
And so,

324
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:24,090
so the more exploratory kids who are 
lower negative emotion will go out 

325
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:24,310
farther before they come back to their 
mother.

326
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:29,430
So the mother is the center and you know
that that would be associated 

327
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,881
symbolically with the idea of the center
as a motherland or potentially as a 

328
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:32,881
father like that.
That's right.

329
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:33,960
That makes sense.
So this way that we're,

330
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,740
we're incredibly symbolic creatures.
We're not just out to make as much money

331
00:15:37,741 --> 00:15:42,741
as we can.
Where's this symbolic and social 

332
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:45,111
creatures and this psychology of 
sanctity or purity has become really 

333
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,380
important,
not just on the right.

334
00:15:46,381 --> 00:15:51,381
It's always been important for 
especially religious conservatives were 

335
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:52,500
beginning to see it even on the campus 
left,

336
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:56,970
and this is why I think we see some of 
the odd things we see on campus that the

337
00:15:56,971 --> 00:16:00,660
campus must be kept as a sacred and pure
space.

338
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:06,230
One of the things that really alarms me 
about what's happening on campus last 

339
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,351
couple of years is that the older idea 
we had that it's a place for contesting 

340
00:16:09,661 --> 00:16:11,100
ideas.
It's A.

341
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,660
It's a zone of enormous choice.
People can take what courses they want,

342
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,680
say what they want.
It's kind of a wonderful free for all 

343
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,881
with some with norms of respect.
It's now becoming much more of a 

344
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,661
religious zone where the perimeter of 
the campus is the boundaries and within 

345
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,640
its they're almost.
They're blasphemy laws basically,

346
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:35,090
and I really started noticing this.
When you look at the videos of the 

347
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,421
Middlebury,
a protest when Charles Murray spoke at 

348
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:38,970
Middlebury and as,
as everybody knows,

349
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,120
he was shouted down so the students are 
chanting and they're chanting in unison 

350
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,200
and it seems like a religious revival 
meeting and they're swaying and they're 

351
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,220
saying they're sacred in a racist,
sexist,

352
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,710
antigay.
Charles Murray go away.

353
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,850
It's like a ritual incantation.
Um,

354
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,870
so that all the space is safe and it's 
safe and

355
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:04,770
not yet.
So far all of this happening is they're 

356
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:04,770
binding together.
They're moving and you know,

357
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,790
synchronous movement and call and 
response.

358
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,450
So it's using a lot of tropes from 
religion and religious worship.

359
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,540
But here's the cool thing,
when the administrator,

360
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,430
I forget who it is,
comes on to say,

361
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,130
okay,
we have moved,

362
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:22,250
we're moving the talk.
And then you hear a couple people 

363
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,821
screaming out off campus off campus and 
he says to another location on campus 

364
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,600
and there's like,
oh no,

365
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,820
no,
because you know,

366
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,360
no one had to go to this talk.
So everyone could have just stayed home 

367
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,620
and the students did succeed in shutting
down the venues so they could have 

368
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,850
declared victory.
But it's not a full victory unless he is

369
00:17:44,851 --> 00:17:49,851
physically off the campus.
We can't have him speaking on because 

370
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:50,640
that defiles

371
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,080
us,
that pollutes us.

372
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,710
We must shut that down.
And that's where I started saying,

373
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:00,711
wow,
this is like full blown psychology of 

374
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:00,711
religion,
Durkheim,

375
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:01,200
sanctity,
purity,

376
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:02,760
blast for me.
Uh,

377
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,120
and that I think,
you know,

378
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:05,730
that that doesn't describe most students
that,

379
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:09,870
that describes this sort of the core,
those who who really have their identity

380
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:11,990
is wrapped up in this movement.
Okay.

381
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,770
So,
so we discussed,

382
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:18,771
I wanted to,
I wanted to ask you a couple of things 

383
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:18,771
about that.
So,

384
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:22,970
you know,
the big five research into political 

385
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:23,850
differences basically shows that the 
liberals are high in trait,

386
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:28,851
openness and low in trait 
conscientiousness and the conservatives 

387
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:30,210
or the reverse,
but we fragmented conscientiousness into

388
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:33,590
orderliness and industriousness with the
big five aspects.

389
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:37,110
Scale and orderliness is strongly 
associated with disgust.

390
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,840
So.
So it sounds like Freud.

391
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:40,170
Yeah,
right,

392
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,010
right,
exactly.

393
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:42,770
It does sound a lot like Freud but it.

394
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:47,810
But it also is in accordance with your 
observations that conservatives have 

395
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,000
neater spaces,
for example.

396
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:53,001
So,
so now and they're meeting start on 

397
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:53,001
time.
Yes.

398
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:53,001
Yeah,
exactly.

399
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:53,001
Right.
Right.

400
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:54,700
So.
So then the,

401
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:59,701
the,
the nexus for political belief seems to 

402
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:02,151
be openness so that that exploratory 
tendency that you talked about 

403
00:19:02,151 --> 00:19:07,070
exploration of ideas and creativity and 
low orderliness and so then I thought,

404
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:12,681
well why in the world would,
why would the political nexus go across 

405
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:16,431
those dimensions,
which are some relatively uncorrelated 

406
00:19:16,431 --> 00:19:17,430
than I thought,
and this is in keeping with your work on

407
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:20,220
discussed is that it's an issue of 
borders,

408
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:25,250
which of course seems more or less self 
evident in the wake of trump's election 

409
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,090
when he talked about borders,
but you might say,

410
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:32,091
and I think this is reasonable,
that the conservative is someone who 

411
00:19:32,091 --> 00:19:36,260
wants the borders between categories to 
remain intact no matter what level of 

412
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,540
analysis.

413
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:42,110
So it's borders from the highest 
resolution level of cognition all the 

414
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,580
way up to the actual physical borders 
of,

415
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,000
of,
of rooms,

416
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,980
towns,
states,

417
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,150
countries,
all of that.

418
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:51,900
So the borders should be thicker and the
reason they want that.

419
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,240
Now there was a paper published in Plos 
one.

420
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:56,160
I don't know if you saw it.
It was a couple of years ago,

421
00:19:56,161 --> 00:20:01,161
it was a mind boggling paper,
it should have been front page news as 

422
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:04,131
far as I was concerned and what the 
researchers did was between countries 

423
00:20:04,131 --> 00:20:07,410
and then within provinces or states 
within countries,

424
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,860
they correlated the level of,
um,

425
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,400
of frequency of infectious disease with 
authoritarian political beliefs and 

426
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,700
found a walloping correlation.
It was like point six.

427
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:22,320
It was one of the highest by the,
for,

428
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,880
for,
for those of you who don't know,

429
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,090
social scientists never discover 
anything that's associated with anything

430
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:29,940
else at a correlation of point six other
than heritability.

431
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,470
Right?
Other than heritability.

432
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:36,471
Yes.
And so what they found was that the 

433
00:20:36,471 --> 00:20:36,471
higher the prevalence of infectious 
disease,

434
00:20:36,471 --> 00:20:40,641
the higher the probability of,
of totalitarian authoritarian political 

435
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:44,991
attitudes,
and then they controlled for governance 

436
00:20:44,991 --> 00:20:47,600
because one of the questions was,
was this pop down authoritarianism or 

437
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,681
bottom authoritarianism?
And the answer was that it was bottom 

438
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:51,681
up.
Okay.

439
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:55,381
And so I thought about that in two from 
two perspectives simultaneously at the 

440
00:20:57,101 --> 00:20:58,180
time.
Okay.

441
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:00,820
So we identified disgust,
sensitivity with orderliness,

442
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,880
so say a fundamental sub trait.
Then I was reading this book that was 

443
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:08,740
called Hitler's table talk,
and it was a,

444
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:13,860
it was the recordings of virtually 
everything he said at dinner from 1939 

445
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,650
to 1942.
Yeah.

446
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:18,300
So it's a spontaneous utterance,
say and um,

447
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,010
it's full of discussions about Jews and 
Gypsies and older people he tormented.

448
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:26,750
But what's really interesting is all the
language is discussed.

449
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,930
It's not fear.
So,

450
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,940
so Hitler is basic metaphor was that the
Aryan race and country was a pure body 

451
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,900
and then it was assaulted by parasites.
Right?

452
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:42,901
And then I remembered what happened to 
the native Americans when the Europeans 

453
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:46,231
showed up and shook hands.
What happened was that 95 percent of 

454
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:46,480
them are dead within 50 years,
right?

455
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:50,260
Because of smallpox and measles.
And so that,

456
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:54,520
that border issue that separates 
conservatives from liberals,

457
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:59,521
let's say,
is the conservative say the novel is 

458
00:21:59,521 --> 00:22:01,270
potentially contaminated.
It's not so much that it's dangerous.

459
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:02,590
That's different.
That's fear.

460
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:04,540
It's contaminated.
And the Liberals say,

461
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,150
hold on a minute.
If you make the borders too thick,

462
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:09,400
then information can't pass through.
Exactly.

463
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:11,100
So that's the Omnivore's dilemma right 
there.

464
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,050
Right,
right.

465
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:17,060
And,
and then since we have a biological 

466
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,800
architecture on which are cognitive 
platforms are erected,

467
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,460
we have the same attitude towards 
abstract information,

468
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:25,010
which would be ideas that we do to 
things like food or,

469
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,560
or illness.
Right?

470
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:31,590
Right.
And so we can think of an invading idea 

471
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:31,590
or a polluting idea or contaminated.

472
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,070
And that's right now I'm a big fan of 
George lakoff metaphors.

473
00:22:34,071 --> 00:22:36,110
We live by a that we,
yeah,

474
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:41,140
we use our bodily or bodily Schema data 
to think about abstract things like 

475
00:22:41,241 --> 00:22:44,870
politics and like what our policies 
should be about borders and immigration.

476
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,400
Uh,
there's a Canadian psychologist,

477
00:22:46,401 --> 00:22:51,401
mark shaller.
He and his colleagues have developed 

478
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:51,800
what they call an account over these,
the behavioral immune system,

479
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,480
right?
That we don't just try to,

480
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:58,650
you know,
microbes killed probably many more of 

481
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,661
our ancestors then did lions and tigers 
and bears and so whoever can keep 

482
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:05,180
themselves and their children from being
exposed to fatal illnesses,

483
00:23:05,181 --> 00:23:10,181
winds the evolutionary game.
And so a lot of that is judging 

484
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:10,280
carefully about people.
Is he dangerous,

485
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,860
dangerous.
And that's both for sexuality,

486
00:23:12,861 --> 00:23:15,170
for contact,
for all kinds of association.

487
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:16,220
Um,
so yeah,

488
00:23:16,221 --> 00:23:20,150
and a lot of ways our emotions and our 
bodily interactions structure,

489
00:23:20,151 --> 00:23:22,940
how we think and feel about about 
social.

490
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,180
Well even with the black death in 
Europe,

491
00:23:25,181 --> 00:23:30,181
I mean,
so the black death occurred in Europe 

492
00:23:30,181 --> 00:23:32,701
when the Europeans started to move 
around the world and they brought back 

493
00:23:32,701 --> 00:23:32,701
rats that were infected.
Exactly.

494
00:23:32,701 --> 00:23:37,201
So,
so what you saw there was both of those 

495
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:39,151
forces at work at the same time.
So the European expansion produced a 

496
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,080
tremendous interchange of ideas from all
around the world.

497
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:46,081
That's globalization,
but it wiped out somewhere between 30 

498
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:46,250
and 60 percent of the population at the 
same time.

499
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,050
So wouldn't it be good if in every 
society,

500
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,080
every organization.
And we had some people who specialized 

501
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,080
in,
uh,

502
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,290
a specialized in saying,
hey,

503
00:23:55,291 --> 00:24:00,291
what are the opportunities?
And then we had other people who 

504
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:00,291
specialize in saying,
well,

505
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:03,501
but what are the risks?
And it just so happens that a lot of 

506
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:03,750
people have trouble doing all that in 
themselves.

507
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,080
When we have systems that are well 
constituted with people who have 

508
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,240
different personalities and different 
motives and goals,

509
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,420
we actually can get better at.

510
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,500
We can have a discussion between them.
Yeah,

511
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:16,300
well that's exactly why that is for that
precise reason that,

512
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,220
that I've been so interested in free 
speech as a,

513
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:24,221
as a,
as a value because or even on the 

514
00:24:24,221 --> 00:24:26,801
economic front,
it's pretty obvious if you look at 

515
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:29,411
things economically that the 
entrepreneur types who start businesses 

516
00:24:29,411 --> 00:24:31,160
are lumped in with the liberal creative 
types.

517
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:36,161
We've done a lot of work on the 
prediction of entrepreneurial behavior 

518
00:24:36,161 --> 00:24:36,680
on the ability and his openness.
That's the big predictor.

519
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:39,230
It's not the only one.
It's openness and ICU fundamentally,

520
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,350
but for managerial and administrative 
expertise,

521
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:42,900
it's,
oh,

522
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,850
it's Iq and conscientiousness.
So the liberal start businesses,

523
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,860
but they can't run them because they're 
there.

524
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:54,970
Their interests flipped and they don't 
have the organizational ability and the 

525
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,330
conservatives can run them,
but they can't continue to transform and

526
00:24:56,331 --> 00:24:56,870
expand them.

527
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,590
Yeah.
10 and Yang.

528
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,790
Yin and Yang.
Yep.

529
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,710
So,
so one more thing about what happened in

530
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:07,120
Nazi Germany that that's very relevant 
and interesting because it's,

531
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,710
it's useful to get these motives right.
You know,

532
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,880
first of all,
if,

533
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,130
if something disgusts you,
if something,

534
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,790
if you're afraid of something then you 
run away from it or you free,

535
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,880
but if something disgusts you,
you try to burn it or dig or kill it.

536
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,160
Right.
You try to get rid of or expel it.

537
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:23,060
That's,
that's right though.

538
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:28,150
You want to get it away and destroy it.
So when Hitler came to power,

539
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,340
he putting a bunch of public health 
schemes,

540
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:36,341
like a,
he had vans that went around and screen 

541
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:36,830
people for tuberculosis and then he went
on a factory,

542
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:39,290
cleanliness,
a campaign.

543
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,690
So the factories were supposed to be 
tidy it up and he,

544
00:25:42,691 --> 00:25:47,691
he washed,
he made about four times a day by the 

545
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:47,691
way.

546
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:47,691
It's also a great worship or of 
willpower,

547
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:52,241
which is associated with orderliness and
seems maybe to be associated with 

548
00:25:52,241 --> 00:25:53,750
disgust sensitivity in some way that 
isn't yet understood.

549
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

550
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:55,820
Um,
I don't,

551
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,470
I don't understand that connection 
either.

552
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,040
So they,
he convinced factory owners in Germany 

553
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,700
to get rid of the rats and the mice and 
the mice and the and the insects in the 

554
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,360
factories and also to clean them up and 
beautify them.

555
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:13,640
But the gas they use to clean up the 
factories was like lawn a and it was the

556
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:16,580
variation of that gas cycle on b that 
was then used in.

557
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,730
Yeah.
So you could see this ramping up based.

558
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,820
So it was.
Yeah,

559
00:26:19,821 --> 00:26:22,190
absolutely.
So it was public health,

560
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:27,460
then it was social cleanliness,
then he went into the asylums and 

561
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,871
cleaned them up and so it was just this 
expansion of who was contaminated and 

562
00:26:31,871 --> 00:26:36,761
who was impure.
And I think also his fascination with 

563
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,380
fire and his use of fire symbolism was 
also associated with that.

564
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,680
Would that appeal to purification?
Because the whole idea of purification 

565
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:44,680
by fire

566
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,440
is a very ancient idea.
So.

567
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:47,970
Okay.
So,

568
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:53,630
so how did your work on discuss change 
the way that you looked at things 

569
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,010
fundamentally mean you gave some 
indication of that already,

570
00:26:56,011 --> 00:26:58,250
but what else has changed?
Um,

571
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,440
so since I was coming out of a,
of a psychological literature that was 

572
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,510
very focused on,
on sort of secular,

573
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:10,200
secular ethics about justice and 
fairness,

574
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,760
and then I began studying disgust and 
looking at the broader moral domain.

575
00:27:14,761 --> 00:27:19,290
They're almost all societies have.
That then also led me to think about,

576
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:19,590
well,
okay,

577
00:27:19,591 --> 00:27:23,730
if disgust is a reaction to things that 
seem to be degrading.

578
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:29,060
So an interesting element of discusses 
this notion of degradation that there 

579
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,840
are always these vertical metaphors.
I'm a image discuss,

580
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:35,841
brings us down and discussed.
So a lot of some religious practice in 

581
00:27:35,841 --> 00:27:39,321
Judaism and Islam and Hinduism is about 
preparing your body to approach God and 

582
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,100
uh,
purification.

583
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,480
And so that led me to think,
well,

584
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:47,481
if there's an emotion which is about 
seeing our lower base or animal 

585
00:27:47,481 --> 00:27:49,530
biological nature,
is there an opposite?

586
00:27:49,531 --> 00:27:54,531
Emotion is an emotion of that.
We feel when we see some manifestation 

587
00:27:54,531 --> 00:27:57,871
of a higher nobler nature.
And I was just beginning to think this 

588
00:27:57,871 --> 00:27:57,871
one.
I moved to Uva.

589
00:27:57,871 --> 00:28:02,481
I got my first job at University of 
Virginia in 1995 and I read a stat of 

590
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:06,360
Thomas Jefferson's letters.
And in one letter he describes,

591
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:10,230
he describes the feelings you get from 
reading great fiction,

592
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,100
he advises a cousin of his that he 
should buy fiction for his library,

593
00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:16,650
not just serious works of law and 
philosophy.

594
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,330
And he described,
he says,

595
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,210
doesn't,
he describes the feeling of,

596
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,170
of,
uh,

597
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,860
of uh,
having your sentence be elevated,

598
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,900
does it not dilate your breast or give 
you an open feeling in your chest when 

599
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,160
you see these acts of beauty and 
kindness and gratitude?

600
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,000
I thought,
wow,

601
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:34,550
that's exactly it.
Um,

602
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,540
and so because I've been studying 
disgust,

603
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:41,541
I then started studying its opposite 
which I and some others called moral 

604
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:45,170
elevation.
So this is kind of vertical metaphor of 

605
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,470
elevation and degradation and snaps onto
the body to,

606
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,000
with regards to.
That's right.

607
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:49,740
High low,
a clean,

608
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:51,390
dirty in.
Yeah,

609
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:55,740
it's a beautiful pairing.
And so having this language of elevation

610
00:28:55,741 --> 00:28:58,650
and discussed just really has helped me 
see a lot of things.

611
00:28:58,651 --> 00:29:00,720
I just,
I just see a lot of things happening.

612
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,000
It allows me to like even,
you know,

613
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:04,850
manipulate like have been applying for a
grant proposal.

614
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,830
Like I can get very good at like having 
an elevating ending,

615
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,460
you know,
to,

616
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,450
um,
uh,

617
00:29:09,451 --> 00:29:13,920
to end with a note of uplift.
And so it just brought,

618
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:15,780
it just broadened my thinking about 
morality.

619
00:29:15,781 --> 00:29:18,150
And this was around 1995.
And so again,

620
00:29:18,151 --> 00:29:21,870
it just prepared me is that I'm a and 
I'd already been to India by that point.

621
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,960
I spent three months doing research in a
Rissa in eastern India.

622
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:30,250
Um,
so it just broadened my thinking and 

623
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,660
that's what allowed me finally to 
understand conservatives because I had 

624
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:36,330
always been on the left.
I hated Ronald Reagan.

625
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:41,410
Um,
I thought Republicans were stupid and 

626
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:44,331
evil and it was only when I had gone to 
India and really tried to understand a 

627
00:29:44,331 --> 00:29:48,631
traditional religious hierarchical 
gender stratified society.

628
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:52,060
Tried to understand it in their terms.
They didn't try to just bring in my own,

629
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,980
my own western left,
you know,

630
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:55,940
left leaning perspectives,
um,

631
00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:01,110
that I was.
And this was all under the guidance of 

632
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,751
Richard Schwayder,
my postdoc supervisor at the University 

633
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:05,950
of Chicago where did a postdoc.
It was only then that I was able to sort

634
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:10,951
of get inside their minds and their 
moral system and see that there were 

635
00:30:10,951 --> 00:30:13,981
alternative moral worlds.
They each had their own logic and that 

636
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:14,250
was the metaphor I came to it.

637
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:14,920
You know,
the time,

638
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,080
you know,
the matrix movies were very popular.

639
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:20,290
So the metaphor,
the Matrix as a consensual hallucination

640
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:25,590
made a lot of sense.
It's where I can up with the idea of 

641
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,421
just speaking about moral matrices,
whichever different matrices that are 

642
00:30:27,421 --> 00:30:30,751
grounded in biology,
biology in the sense that it gives us 

643
00:30:30,751 --> 00:30:34,171
the potential.
It's like the building blocks of this 

644
00:30:34,171 --> 00:30:34,171
matrix can't be just anything that 
comes,

645
00:30:34,171 --> 00:30:37,000
it comes from our experiences are 
embodied experiences and again,

646
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,750
George Lakoff is the,
is the master of,

647
00:30:38,751 --> 00:30:40,000
of,
of that thinking.

648
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:45,570
And so it was only then that I was able 
to now listen to conservative talk radio

649
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:51,130
and Christian religious radio and see,
rather than just saying,

650
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,360
oh,
that was stupid terrible.

651
00:30:52,361 --> 00:30:54,280
People say like,
Oh wow.

652
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:59,380
Yeah,
I can see that they're striving for 

653
00:30:59,380 --> 00:30:59,380
certain version.
Right.

654
00:30:59,380 --> 00:30:59,860
So you started to understand their 
metaphorical language essentially.

655
00:30:59,861 --> 00:31:01,420
That's right.
And that was like kind of like my,

656
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:06,421
you know,
I know a great awakening or scales 

657
00:31:06,421 --> 00:31:06,421
falling from my eyes,
but you know,

658
00:31:06,421 --> 00:31:06,421
since.
But it took a few more.

659
00:31:06,421 --> 00:31:07,180
It took a number of,
a lot more years.

660
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:12,270
But eventually I kind of just pulled out
the implants from my eyes and I stopped 

661
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,700
seeing everything through a partisan 
lens and I'm not on any side now.

662
00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:17,250
I'm just trying to understand what the 
hell is.

663
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,490
Well,
it's really useful.

664
00:31:18,491 --> 00:31:23,491
It's really useful to understand that 
there are actual reasons why people see 

665
00:31:23,491 --> 00:31:28,051
the world differently and that you can't
just easily say that one is right and 

666
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:30,070
the other is wrong because the liberals 
are correct when it comes to borders.

667
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:33,070
That if you thicken them too much and 
diminish the information flow,

668
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:38,370
you risk making the society so static 
that any radical environmental 

669
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,210
transformation will sink it.
It's the case,

670
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:45,390
but the conservatives are right in that 
you pay a big price with regards to 

671
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:49,171
newcomers and new information with 
regards to risk to exposure to 

672
00:31:49,171 --> 00:31:50,320
contaminating while to contamination 
period,

673
00:31:50,321 --> 00:31:54,040
but also to contaminating ideas.
And so then I've always thought,

674
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:59,070
you know,
the environment itself moves back and 

675
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,981
forth like a snake in some sense,
and what we're trying to do is stay on 

676
00:32:01,981 --> 00:32:04,330
the center of its back and the only way 
we can do that is by people,

677
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,250
by having people pull to the right and 
say,

678
00:32:06,251 --> 00:32:08,320
be careful.
And people pulled to the left and say,

679
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:08,800
well,
yeah,

680
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:13,801
but be open with that dialogue and the,
the exchange of information that,

681
00:32:14,021 --> 00:32:19,021
that dialogue allows.
We can maybe specify the center of that 

682
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,700
moving target and stay and stay well and
stay on the back,

683
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:22,170
let's say.
Ah,

684
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:27,450
okay.
So that's a really complicated metaphor 

685
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,951
with the snake,
but I think it's a perfect way in to 

686
00:32:28,951 --> 00:32:28,951
what's going on on campus.
And two,

687
00:32:28,951 --> 00:32:30,490
why viewpoint diversity is so important 
because that's,

688
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:35,230
I agree exactly with what you just said.
And so what I,

689
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:40,160
the view that I've come to in studying 
moral psychology is that we have,

690
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:43,990
is that humans are ultra social apes.
Um,

691
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,970
we,
we evolved to live in these small groups

692
00:32:46,971 --> 00:32:49,560
that are fighting with each other.
Uh,

693
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,030
we evolved to have these low level 
animistic religions.

694
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:58,031
That's our steady state,
that's the way we were for at least 

695
00:32:58,031 --> 00:32:58,031
100,000
years,

696
00:32:58,031 --> 00:32:59,840
are much more closer to a million in 
some form.

697
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,970
Um,
so that's sort of our design.

698
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,740
That's what we're designed for in a 
sense.

699
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:09,160
Um,
and in that sense where as individuals 

700
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,050
really kind of stupid tribal creatures 
designed to do post hoc reasoning,

701
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:17,390
um,
but if you put us together in the right 

702
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,080
way with the right checks,
with the right,

703
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,130
the right systems,
um,

704
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,770
the whole can be vastly smarter than the
components that go into it,

705
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,650
which is true of the brain,
to the brain is composed of neurons.

706
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,750
Each neuron is kind of stupid little 
switch,

707
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:35,430
but you put them together in the right 
way and you get something really 

708
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:35,430
brilliant and at the same way,
um,

709
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:40,030
I don't know all the history here,
but my understanding is that science 

710
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:43,241
begins or the culture of science,
the scientific revolution begins in 

711
00:33:43,241 --> 00:33:47,270
Europe in the 17th century.
As you begin getting,

712
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,850
you get the printing press so people can
share their ideas,

713
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,910
but you get communities of people who 
are challenging each other's ideas.

714
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:58,270
And that's what makes it so brilliant is
that is that people have to do their 

715
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:02,410
best.
We're really bad at this confirming our 

716
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,511
own ideas.
It's very hard to make it very hard to 

717
00:34:04,511 --> 00:34:06,641
do that.
But you put your ideas out there and 

718
00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:06,641
then everyone else is motivated to 
challenge them.

719
00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:08,720
And so if you put us together in the 
right way,

720
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:09,830
the truth comes out.

721
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:13,310
And so adversarial systems of law 
journalists know this.

722
00:34:13,311 --> 00:34:15,680
They have to listen to both sides.
Scientists know this.

723
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,900
Social scientists should know this.
Okay?

724
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,850
What happened?
Well,

725
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,220
I'm,
the academy has,

726
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,830
has always leaned left in the 20th 
century,

727
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,280
but leaning isn't a problem.
So people think,

728
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:30,080
oh,
viewpoint diversity we need,

729
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,700
we need everybody.
We need Nazis.

730
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:32,350
We need every,
the,

731
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,950
no,
we don't need everybody.

732
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,390
What we need is no orthodoxy.
That's what's fatal orthodoxy.

733
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,060
So if you have a,
if you have to feel it,

734
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:46,061
like sociology or social psychology in 
which it's two or three to one left to 

735
00:34:46,061 --> 00:34:47,120
right,
that's totally fine with me.

736
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,980
That's totally fine.
Uh,

737
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:53,570
because if someone makes some claim 
that's just like ideologically blind,

738
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,520
someone will say,
uh,

739
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,880
you know,
common sense,

740
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:59,660
other evidence that you've missed and 
then the system works.

741
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,710
But what I learned when I started down 
this road in 2011,

742
00:35:03,711 --> 00:35:06,800
I gave a talk at the big conference with
social psychologists.

743
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,100
I gave a talk about this problem that 
we're losing our diversity,

744
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:15,200
that I could only find one conservative 
in the entire field and I gave a talk on

745
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:16,370
this.
Um,

746
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,040
and um,
um,

747
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:24,550
and so what I've learned since then is 
that the ratio in psychology was between

748
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:27,590
two to one in Florida.
One left,

749
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:29,690
right?
All the way up to the early nineties.

750
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,820
We've gathered together all the studies 
we could find.

751
00:35:31,821 --> 00:35:36,821
So all the up to the early nineties,
it's only three or four to one left to 

752
00:35:36,821 --> 00:35:36,821
right,
which would be okay,

753
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,860
but between 1995 or four and 2010,
it goes to a 14 to one.

754
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,830
Do you have any idea why and why that 
time?

755
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,510
Yes.
So,

756
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,600
um,
so you get the same story whether you 

757
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,971
look at Republican,
Democrat ratios or liberal conservative 

758
00:35:55,971 --> 00:35:55,971
there,
they tell the same story.

759
00:35:55,971 --> 00:35:57,900
So the,
two of the big things going on there are

760
00:35:57,901 --> 00:36:01,830
one is that the greatest generation 
which had a lot of Republicans,

761
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,830
um,
so a lot of men go off to World War Two,

762
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,630
they on there,
on the Gi bill,

763
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,850
they entered the academy in the 19 
fifties.

764
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:13,980
A lot of them are conservative or 
Republican and so you have a lot of 

765
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,910
them,
but in the sixties and seventies,

766
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,450
one of the main reasons to go to Grad 
school and the social sciences is either

767
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,720
a,
to stay in school to escape the Vietnam 

768
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,960
war draft or be to fight for social 
justice and against racism.

769
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,380
So in sociology and psychology in 
particular in political science,

770
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:29,160
maybe,
I'm not sure,

771
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,520
you get a huge influx of left leaning 
people who are there to pursue social 

772
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,760
justice.
So you know,

773
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:39,330
the motives are fine and if it was 
balanced to be totally fine,

774
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,100
but as you get these young junior people
on the left come in in the seventies and

775
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:49,101
eighties and then you get the older 
people that are more politically 

776
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:49,110
bounced,
retiring of the eighties and nineties by

777
00:36:49,111 --> 00:36:52,470
the time you get to the late nineties,
it's all baby boomers.

778
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,640
And so do you get a,
you get a positive feedback loop 

779
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:57,640
developing their,
like you said,

780
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,410
it's like three to one.
It's okay,

781
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:01,620
but maybe when it hits four to one,
it goes to like 20 to one,

782
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,580
then you stay.
Exactly.

783
00:37:02,581 --> 00:37:07,581
So then,
so then you start getting hostile 

784
00:37:07,581 --> 00:37:09,921
climate.
So I wrote a review paper on this with 

785
00:37:09,921 --> 00:37:12,590
a,
with Joe Duarte and Phil tetlock and 

786
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:12,590
lead Justin Jarrett,
Crawford.

787
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,540
Um,
um,

788
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,200
and um,
and we,

789
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:21,290
uh,
we reviewed everything that we could 

790
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,380
find and we concluded that most of 
what's going on is self selection.

791
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,870
That is people on the left are more open
to experience.

792
00:37:24,871 --> 00:37:27,240
They're always going to get self 
selection.

793
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:30,690
But then there's really good evidence 
that there's also hostile climate.

794
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,720
I mean,
it's undeniable now that if you are not 

795
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,541
on the left in a Grad program,
there's just constant little subtle or 

796
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:39,840
not so subtle reminders that you don't 
belong.

797
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,360
And look in the academy,
we're all about saying,

798
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:47,630
Hey,
if there are subtle hints here and 

799
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:47,630
there,
you can't succeed,

800
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:47,630
right?
I mean,

801
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,010
that's what we do for a living is we say
that little things will stop people.

802
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,210
Um,
well,

803
00:37:51,211 --> 00:37:53,850
little things are put in the way of 
anyone who doesn't fit politically.

804
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,040
Uh,
and so you do get hostile climate.

805
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,410
You do get over discrimination.
There's evidence of that.

806
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:03,650
And then there is also,
it is part of the story here that what 

807
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,610
it means to be a conservative in the 
nineties and especially to thousands has

808
00:38:05,611 --> 00:38:08,540
changed.
So it is true that you know,

809
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:09,690
that,
that the,

810
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,360
the conservative,
we're not in any way anti science,

811
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,510
um,
until much more recent times.

812
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:17,200
Now actually all sides are anti science 
fact,

813
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:20,400
different sciences.
But I'm in America,

814
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:23,460
they're the right wing.
The Republican Party has,

815
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:29,270
it's controversial,
but I do believe that the polarization 

816
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:29,270
starts with the right moving further 
out.

817
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,380
So what it means to be conservative to 
the anti anti evolutionary,

818
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,170
which is actually what's happening on 
the left now to exactly.

819
00:38:34,171 --> 00:38:36,070
That's so as this modern like talked to

820
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,230
Brent Weinstein the other day and you 
know,

821
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:38,770
he,
he,

822
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,800
one of his claims is that evolutionary 
biology has something in it to offend 

823
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,130
everyone.
So it's a,

824
00:38:45,131 --> 00:38:48,430
it's a science that's very likely to be 
targeted by extremist.

825
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:53,580
You also brought up something that 
actually touches on the ICT on the 

826
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:57,730
difficult problem of how it is that you 
might define someone whose ideologically

827
00:38:57,731 --> 00:38:58,720
possessed,
let's say,

828
00:38:58,721 --> 00:39:03,721
or ideologically rigid because the idea 
was that you can make a valid case for 

829
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:07,100
the utility of free information flow 
and,

830
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:12,230
and the free flow of people that would 
go along with that and you could make a 

831
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:15,451
good case for the danger of that.
And so the idea might be that if you're 

832
00:39:15,451 --> 00:39:16,480
only making a case for the danger of 
that,

833
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,020
then you're tilted too far to the right.
And if you're only making a case for the

834
00:39:20,021 --> 00:39:22,390
utility of that,
then you're tilted too far to the left.

835
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,550
Exactly.
That's right.

836
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,130
And so we can look at immigration as a 
nice example.

837
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:27,720
There was a recent essay in the 
Atlantic,

838
00:39:27,721 --> 00:39:31,020
I think it was by Peter Beinart where 
he,

839
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,120
um,
he reviews,

840
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,480
he had started with a lot of quotes that
are pretty nuanced positions about 

841
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,140
immigration from Barack Obama,
Paul Krugman and a bunch of other people

842
00:39:40,141 --> 00:39:43,260
on the left who used to be able to say,
on the one hand,

843
00:39:43,261 --> 00:39:44,460
you know,
compassion,

844
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,080
economic,
on the other hand,

845
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:51,290
you know,
we have to have a legal process and 

846
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,380
there's a threat to low wage workers.
So people on the left,

847
00:39:52,381 --> 00:39:55,530
you still have to talk about immigration
and talk about the pros and cons,

848
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,560
the pluses and minuses.
But beinart shows how in the last four 

849
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,980
or five years you can't,
if you so much as suggest that will,

850
00:40:01,981 --> 00:40:06,981
maybe immigration is a net good,
but it might have some deleterious 

851
00:40:07,111 --> 00:40:10,380
effects on certain classes of,
of low wage American workers.

852
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,630
You could get in big trouble,
right?

853
00:40:12,631 --> 00:40:17,631
Because that's instantly prejudicial 
because immigration has become a sacred 

854
00:40:17,631 --> 00:40:21,891
topic.
So this is the key thing that I want 

855
00:40:21,891 --> 00:40:23,811
everyone to keep in mind.
We are fundamentally religious 

856
00:40:23,811 --> 00:40:25,500
creatures.
Were built for religion and it's a great

857
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:30,501
achievement to create a scientific 
establishment and an academic 

858
00:40:30,501 --> 00:40:31,140
establishment that keeps that way of 
thinking out.

859
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,540
Scientific thinking is not natural 
thinking.

860
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:38,630
Religious thinking is natural thinking 
and what's happening to us in the last 

861
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,250
few years especially is a flooding in of
religious thinking,

862
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:44,850
and so let's get a bunch of social 
scientists talk about immigration.

863
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,920
What are they going to do?
Look at the data,

864
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,540
way up.
The pluses and minuses.

865
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,390
No,
they're going to.

866
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:54,930
Many of them feel they're on a team and 
that team is fighting the right.

867
00:40:54,931 --> 00:40:57,390
The right is anti-immigrant.
It includes racist elements,

868
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:00,900
therefore that justifies us in being 
pro.

869
00:41:00,901 --> 00:41:03,870
Immigration and social sciences are 
always.

870
00:41:03,871 --> 00:41:06,770
There's always ambiguity.
There's always conflicting studies,

871
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:12,190
multiple causal factors.
Is that always in the social science 

872
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:12,190
study?
That's right.

873
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:16,310
So buying art's point was that the left 
used to be able to think straight about 

874
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:20,991
immigration.
Clearly it had a generally pro 

875
00:41:20,991 --> 00:41:23,481
immigration,
but it used to be able to think 

876
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,951
straight,
but in the last few years a religious 

877
00:41:24,951 --> 00:41:24,960
orthodox mindset has overtaken it.

878
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:29,990
Okay.
So we might as well also pointed out 

879
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:29,990
that it's a primordial religious 
mindset,

880
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,930
right?
Because I mean there are,

881
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,380
yeah,
definitely Christian or Jewish,

882
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,630
I mean ancient tribal,
small scale,

883
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:36,760
lots of gods.
Right,

884
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,310
right.
Well,

885
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:42,311
so then one of the things that you might
suggest is that when you throw out a 

886
00:41:42,311 --> 00:41:45,851
sophisticated religious structure,
an unsophisticated religious structure 

887
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,780
comes in to fill the gap.
I do.

888
00:41:47,781 --> 00:41:50,930
So that's true.
That's definitely worth thinking about.

889
00:41:50,931 --> 00:41:52,400
So that's right.
So that's right.

890
00:41:52,401 --> 00:41:57,401
The thing to the right with religions,
we have to clarify a fundamentalism is 

891
00:41:57,401 --> 00:41:57,650
the problem,
not religion.

892
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,800
And so if you close tribalism,
that's right.

893
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:03,100
If you get a fundamentalist,
you know,

894
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:08,170
I'm happy to stay.
And if you have people applying to a 

895
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:08,960
Grad program in psychology and I find 
out that they're Christian,

896
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,670
that's fine.
There's no problem.

897
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,210
But if they're fundamentalist Christian,
I would think,

898
00:42:14,211 --> 00:42:15,330
well let's say let's say it's not 
psychologists,

899
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:16,500
suppose it's,
you know,

900
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:19,970
geology.
So someone applies to a geology program,

901
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:22,880
there are fundamentalist young earth 
creationist.

902
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,340
Are you gonna admit them?
No,

903
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:29,090
I don't think you should.
They're not able to do the right kind of

904
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:32,150
thinking based on what we know to be the
case.

905
00:42:32,151 --> 00:42:34,280
They're there.
They're not in the scientific paradigm,

906
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:36,080
not in the Santa that's right.
So,

907
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:40,130
so if we wouldn't admit a fundamentalist
Christian to a geology program,

908
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:45,430
why would we admit someone who is just 
as fundamentalist about certain moral 

909
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:49,391
and political issues into a sociology 
program or into a psychology program if 

910
00:42:49,391 --> 00:42:53,741
they come in knowing what the right 
answer is committed to that right 

911
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:57,221
answer.
Likely to get angry at anyone who 

912
00:42:57,221 --> 00:42:58,130
contravenes that right answer.
Um,

913
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:01,790
and,
and showing signs of close mindedness.

914
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,300
I don't think they belong in a grab the.
I guess the question is how in the world

915
00:43:05,301 --> 00:43:10,301
do you set up mechanisms to ensure that 
you're not swamped by fundamentalists of

916
00:43:10,731 --> 00:43:11,420
any sort?

917
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,360
So those are people who are reducing 
everything to a single cause.

918
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:19,361
It's something like that.
How can you implement a structure that 

919
00:43:19,361 --> 00:43:23,050
protects the organization against that 
without the structure itself becoming 

920
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:24,470
totalitarian?
Because these things,

921
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:26,450
these things spin out of control so 
fast.

922
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:31,700
But so what we have to realize in the 
academy is that we face,

923
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:34,450
I think we face an existential crisis.
Um,

924
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:38,540
we rely in enormous amount on public 
goodwill.

925
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,250
We get enormous tax subsidies,
a direct research support,

926
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:48,850
and recent polling shows that while 
Democrats have always had a higher 

927
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:50,840
opinion of the universities and 
Republicans until two years ago,

928
00:43:50,841 --> 00:43:53,030
everybody thought universities are a 
good thing.

929
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:58,090
They make life better.
So Americans have been very supportive 

930
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:00,881
of higher education.
There have been rising grapes on the 

931
00:44:00,881 --> 00:44:02,030
right,
but it's only between 2015 and 2017 that

932
00:44:02,031 --> 00:44:07,031
now republicans go from saying mostly 
universities are good things in two 

933
00:44:07,031 --> 00:44:07,031
years.

934
00:44:07,031 --> 00:44:08,540
They go way down and say universities 
are bad things.

935
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:10,370
They're making things worse.
Now,

936
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:14,380
how is this news greeted pundits on the 
Left Rsa?

937
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:17,690
Oh,
those republicans are so anti science.

938
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:21,050
Look how ignorant they are.
They now hate universities.

939
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:24,620
Come on.
Anybody who's been watching the news,

940
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:27,130
anybody who's seen the mobs to shout 
downs,

941
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:29,390
the illiberal behavior.
You know,

942
00:44:29,391 --> 00:44:30,920
the metaphor I use is like,
you know,

943
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:34,260
Americans on the right and left are 
really supportive of the military.

944
00:44:34,261 --> 00:44:36,150
We have a,
it's one of the few institutions that we

945
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:37,800
still hold in highest team on both 
sides,

946
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,380
and so the Republicans more than 
Democrats.

947
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,370
So suppose you had Gallup poll and I,
uh,

948
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:45,000
showing Republicans liked the military 
more than Democrats,

949
00:44:45,001 --> 00:44:50,001
but both really like it.
Then suddenly in 2015 we started seeing 

950
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:55,060
video from all over military bases,
the military academies in which the,

951
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,260
the military leaders are overtly right 
wing.

952
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:03,350
They're there,
they're saying terrible things about 

953
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:04,710
leftists and progressives and the 
midshipmen and cadets,

954
00:45:04,711 --> 00:45:08,580
and everybody is mobbing the occasional 
liberal and they're behaving in a really

955
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,740
despicable,
scary and intimidating way.

956
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:14,070
What do you think the left would now 
think about the military?

957
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:19,100
Obviously support for the military would
plummet and that's what's happening in 

958
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,791
America with universities.
We are losing the support of half the 

959
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:23,220
country.
This is unsustainable,

960
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,700
especially in red states where they 
control the purse strings.

961
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:31,530
So I think we have a major crisis.
I think we've got to go into crisis mode

962
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:36,710
and we've got to clean up our act.
So just as we're doing in psychology 

963
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,951
with replication project W,
we recognize that our methods weren't 

964
00:45:39,951 --> 00:45:40,950
good enough and we're doing a crash 
course,

965
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:43,590
a thanks to Brian Nosek and others,
the open science project.

966
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,830
We're really trying to improve our game.
Thank God we need to.

967
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:50,130
I think we have to do the exact same 
thing about partisanship,

968
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:51,420
um,
and our,

969
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:52,230
our duties.
Okay.

970
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:55,410
So let's talk about Heterodox Academy 
because you set that up,

971
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,040
this organization that you should tell 
everybody about in,

972
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:01,170
in precisely to deal with this issue.
And so I'd like,

973
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:04,740
I'd like to know about how it's growing,
what it's doing,

974
00:46:04,741 --> 00:46:06,120
what your aims are,
all of that.

975
00:46:06,121 --> 00:46:11,121
Yeah.
So I gave this talk in 2011 laying out 

976
00:46:11,121 --> 00:46:14,330
the fact that we have no more 
conservatives and social psychology and 

977
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:15,360
why this makes it hard for us to find 
truth.

978
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,610
And uh,
in the months after that,

979
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:20,010
a few social psychologists resonated 
with the message.

980
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:20,550
They said,
wow,

981
00:46:20,551 --> 00:46:21,630
I think that,
I think you're right.

982
00:46:21,631 --> 00:46:23,820
I have some data on this.
So the five of us,

983
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,200
six of us wrote this paper,
came out in behavioral and brain 

984
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,790
sciences.
I'm Charlotte a stern,

985
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,800
I'm sorry,
what's the sixth one that I forgot to 

986
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:36,800
add in before?

987
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:36,800
Um,
we got this paper published and behavior

988
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,250
and brain sciences.
It came out,

989
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:43,340
it was sort of online in 2014,
but it came out for good in the summer 

990
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,940
of Twenty 15,
which coincidentally was the same summer

991
00:46:44,941 --> 00:46:49,941
that my article came out with Greg 
Glucagon off of the coddling of the 

992
00:46:49,941 --> 00:46:53,151
American mind.
That was about things going on with 

993
00:46:53,151 --> 00:46:53,410
undergrads.
But our concern was entirely faculty.

994
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:56,070
It was just the nature of the academic 
community,

995
00:46:56,071 --> 00:47:01,071
the research community.
So we got these two things going on 

996
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:01,071
summer of Twenty 15.
Um,

997
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:03,930
and then that summer I hear from Nick 
Rosenkranz,

998
00:47:03,931 --> 00:47:06,810
a law professor who says we have the 
same problem in law,

999
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:09,100
lost worse in law.
Well,

1000
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:11,070
it really bad and Canada law.
Okay.

1001
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,600
Because,
and as he points out,

1002
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:16,740
we're training all these students,
they never meet a conservative.

1003
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,440
Then they have to go argue cases in 
front of judges,

1004
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,600
half of whom were appointed by 
Republicans.

1005
00:47:21,601 --> 00:47:23,610
They have no idea what a conservative 
thinks.

1006
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,290
This is malpractice.
We've got to train.

1007
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,300
So say,
and I hear from a sociologist,

1008
00:47:27,301 --> 00:47:28,890
Chris Martin,
same thing in sociology,

1009
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,160
so the three of us said,
hey,

1010
00:47:30,161 --> 00:47:35,161
you know,
this is a big problem for the whole 

1011
00:47:35,161 --> 00:47:37,321
account.
Have you looked at faculties of 

1012
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:37,321
education?
Oh my God,

1013
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:37,660
those are the worst by worst,
I don't know the numbers,

1014
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:42,870
but in terms of the vindictiveness that 
the increased the pressure put on any 

1015
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:45,160
nonconforming opinion.
My impression,

1016
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:47,260
I don't have data,
but my impression from the letters I get

1017
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,130
is that

1018
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:52,450
education schools and social work 
schools are the worst.

1019
00:47:52,451 --> 00:47:55,360
That's exactly in keeping with my.
My understanding as well.

1020
00:47:55,361 --> 00:48:00,361
It's hard to tell which of those two or 
worst I would say it's the faculties of 

1021
00:48:00,361 --> 00:48:01,630
education because they have a direct 
pipeline to kids,

1022
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:04,300
but in terms of their effect,
farmer pernicious.

1023
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:04,900
Yeah.
Yeah,

1024
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:05,320
that's right.
Yeah.

1025
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:07,930
But,
but equally equally worked let's say,

1026
00:48:07,931 --> 00:48:12,931
but but more pernicious and the things 
that are happening in the Canadian 

1027
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,130
education system as a consequence of 
that or so reprehensible,

1028
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:19,190
which we'll get to that because it's 
happening here too with these ideas 

1029
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:19,190
filtered down to high school.

1030
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:22,860
I've been so focused on college,
now we're discovering the problem is 

1031
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:24,400
actually baked in.
The liberal attitudes are often baked in

1032
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:24,890
by the time,

1033
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:25,580
right?
Yes.

1034
00:48:25,581 --> 00:48:26,840
And purposefully,
like in,

1035
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,020
in Canada,
increasingly the,

1036
00:48:29,021 --> 00:48:34,021
the radical leftists have control over 
curriculum development and they're 

1037
00:48:34,021 --> 00:48:35,060
starting to develop social justice 
curriculum,

1038
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:39,020
which is what they call them for,
for kindergarten kids.

1039
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:44,340
So let's finish up the headrest academy 
then we'll get back to the earlier 

1040
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:44,340
grades.
So,

1041
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,580
uh,
so originally three of us decided to put

1042
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:50,580
up a website.
I invited all the other authors from 

1043
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:50,580
the,
the bbs paper.

1044
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:51,280
We invited a few other people working on
this.

1045
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,700
And so for the first year we had this 
project,

1046
00:48:53,701 --> 00:48:56,230
it was called Heterodoxacademy.org.
Uh,

1047
00:48:56,231 --> 00:48:58,900
we put the site up on about September 
10th,

1048
00:48:58,901 --> 00:49:03,901
I think it was a 2015 and it was just a 
community of researchers who are 

1049
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:07,930
studying the problem of the lack of 
viewpoint diversity.

1050
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:13,440
Well,
five days later the protest start at 

1051
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,961
Missouri.
So these are racially motivated protest 

1052
00:49:15,961 --> 00:49:18,520
or protest about racial insensitivity in
racial problems at Missouri.

1053
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,860
Um,
and at first it seemed like this is just

1054
00:49:20,861 --> 00:49:23,110
a Missouri prompt,
but coming in the wake of course,

1055
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,570
of of Ferguson and all the videos we saw
of,

1056
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:28,060
of unarmed black men being killed by 
police,

1057
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:33,600
the,
a lot of these concerns spread to other 

1058
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:33,600
universities.
The protests aren't just about race,

1059
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:38,550
but it was that fall of 2015,
especially the Yale protest when the 

1060
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:41,860
president of Yale validates their 
narrative that Yale's are racist place.

1061
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:46,030
We have to reform Yale and then it 
spreads nationally and now suddenly this

1062
00:49:46,031 --> 00:49:48,710
is not just a faculty issue anymore.
So even though it Heterodox Academy,

1063
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,170
we're mostly focused on the faculty were
now seeing it's a complex ecosystem with

1064
00:49:53,171 --> 00:49:58,171
all kinds of forces acting on 
universities so that between 2015 and 

1065
00:49:58,171 --> 00:50:02,761
2017,
the danger of speaking honestly about 

1066
00:50:02,761 --> 00:50:06,931
what you think about an academic or 
intellectual proposition has 

1067
00:50:06,931 --> 00:50:07,840
skyrocketed.
The risk of being mobbed,

1068
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:12,870
ostracized,
formally investigated by title nine 

1069
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:14,110
people for each title.
Nine people here,

1070
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:16,060
we're sitting here at Nyu,
go to any bathroom,

1071
00:50:16,061 --> 00:50:16,440
I'll,
I'll,

1072
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,880
I'll show you on this floor.
Go to any bathroom.

1073
00:50:18,881 --> 00:50:23,881
There's a sign telling students exactly 
what number to call to report you or me 

1074
00:50:23,881 --> 00:50:27,100
if we say something that is,
that someone takes to be a bias.

1075
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,760
Oh,
so you have bias.

1076
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:31,390
You have bias investigation teams here.
That's right.

1077
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:36,480
See,
we haven't got to that point at that 

1078
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,400
particular point in Canada yet.
So I think we're farther ahead down that

1079
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:39,700
path in some ways but not quite as far 
and others.

1080
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:40,580
So yeah,
that's really,

1081
00:50:40,581 --> 00:50:42,860
that's really unbelievable.
So things are changing very,

1082
00:50:42,861 --> 00:50:44,810
very fast.
It's not at all schools.

1083
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:45,830
Uh,
but then again,

1084
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,420
things are changing so fast.
We don't really know.

1085
00:50:47,421 --> 00:50:49,550
We don't have good data on what's going 
on.

1086
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:55,090
What I can tell you though is that a,
at Heterodoxacademy when we started out 

1087
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:56,600
in 2015,
there was a lot of suspicion.

1088
00:50:56,601 --> 00:50:59,000
A lot of people on the left were afraid 
like,

1089
00:50:59,001 --> 00:51:00,560
oh,
is this some right wing group?

1090
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:02,570
Now very few of us are actually on the 
right.

1091
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,900
Um,
but because we end up mostly speaking up

1092
00:51:05,901 --> 00:51:08,900
for Libertarians and conservatives who 
are attacked or silenced,

1093
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:10,280
you know,
people will think,

1094
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:11,180
oh,
we must be right wing,

1095
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:11,720
but we're not.

1096
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:12,220
I mean,
I'm,

1097
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,120
I've never voted for a Republican in my 
life,

1098
00:51:14,121 --> 00:51:15,890
I've never given money to Republican 
campaign.

1099
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:21,180
Um,
I'm now increasingly calling myself a 

1100
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:21,470
liberal now that we see illiberalism 
flourishing.

1101
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:23,930
Um,
but so when we started out,

1102
00:51:23,931 --> 00:51:28,160
there was a lot of suspicion of us from 
many professors,

1103
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:30,740
but now that it's clear that the 
problems,

1104
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:33,410
these are not just a few anecdotes.
This is the new normal,

1105
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,630
um,
and it's not just in the university.

1106
00:51:35,631 --> 00:51:36,860
So as you pointed out,
that's right.

1107
00:51:36,861 --> 00:51:37,630
It's reading,
reading,

1108
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:39,840
reading,
and it's not just in the U.

1109
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,720
S it's spread.
When in Twenty 15,

1110
00:51:41,721 --> 00:51:43,220
I thought it was uniquely American 
problem.

1111
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:48,260
Yes,
it's in Canada and the UK and Australia 

1112
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:48,260
and New Zealand.
That's right.

1113
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,910
It is a uniquely anglosphere problem.
This is really interesting.

1114
00:51:49,911 --> 00:51:51,470
It's not on the continent very much at 
all.

1115
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,540
What about in the Nordic countries?
No,

1116
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:54,050
I mean they have.

1117
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:57,380
So political correctness,
you have lots of places.

1118
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:02,800
The unique thing that identifies this 
new culture is linking the political 

1119
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,941
correctness with the sense of fragility.
And this is something America's 

1120
00:52:06,941 --> 00:52:08,560
pioneered the idea that,
um,

1121
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,550
so the in Britain,
they've always had,

1122
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,240
um,
uh,

1123
00:52:11,241 --> 00:52:14,040
no platforming they call it.
So if there's an end,

1124
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:15,560
there was an effort,
British National Party,

1125
00:52:15,561 --> 00:52:17,170
it's actual fascist party,
you know.

1126
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,060
So if a,
if a BNP is going to speak on campus,

1127
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,740
mob him,
you shut it down.

1128
00:52:21,741 --> 00:52:23,090
No,
don't give him a platform.

1129
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:23,960
So,
you know,

1130
00:52:23,961 --> 00:52:27,440
you've had passionate politics certainly
since the sixties.

1131
00:52:27,441 --> 00:52:29,920
So that's not new and that's everywhere.
Um,

1132
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:35,110
what's new is the American idea that if 
someone says something and it could be a

1133
00:52:35,181 --> 00:52:38,060
sincerely expressed idea,
not a racist rant,

1134
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:39,160
just like,
well,

1135
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:44,170
I don't know.
I think that maybe hormones do affect 

1136
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:44,270
gender behavior.
Can you say that?

1137
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:47,990
Well,
what if someone takes that as,

1138
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:53,200
as somehow essentially using gender and 
then saying that women are inferior or 

1139
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:54,110
whatever,
if they don't.

1140
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,060
Well happened to James Demora for.
Exactly.

1141
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,230
Exactly.
Exactly.

1142
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,790
So,
um,

1143
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:02,990
so that's what's new is the idea that if
someone says something that someone,

1144
00:53:02,991 --> 00:53:06,110
a member of a protected or marginalized 
group is offended by,

1145
00:53:06,111 --> 00:53:09,200
that person is harmed.
If that person has harmed,

1146
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,640
we must protect that person and more 
ominously just in the last year or two.

1147
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,230
It's not just that they're harming their
suffering,

1148
00:53:15,231 --> 00:53:18,110
it's that this was violating his right 
violence.

1149
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,980
Well,
that's part of the postmodern narrative.

1150
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,760
That and distributes whole thing to pass
is so dangerous.

1151
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,070
The crossing the line into,
into violence.

1152
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,490
It just occurred to me just like 
yesterday,

1153
00:53:26,491 --> 00:53:27,720
I was thinking about this.
Wait,

1154
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,930
the state is supposed to have a monopoly
on violence,

1155
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:32,820
right?
But if speech,

1156
00:53:32,821 --> 00:53:35,070
especially his speech and her speech and
the people,

1157
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:38,400
the speech of those people in that 
academic movement or on the and that,

1158
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,880
if their speech is violence,
well the state is supposed to have a 

1159
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:43,880
monopoly on their speech then.

1160
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,350
And um,
and if it's violence,

1161
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:49,500
well then we have a right to use 
violence back.

1162
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,690
The state doesn't have a monopoly on 
violence because our violence is,

1163
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,240
you know,
morally motivated.

1164
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,070
So just the Orwellian and authoritarian 
implications of this move.

1165
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:04,310
Once you say that speech is violence,
you're unlocking your opening Pandora's 

1166
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:04,490
box.
I mean your,

1167
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:08,100
your five steps down the road to hell.
And I'd say we're about seven steps down

1168
00:54:08,101 --> 00:54:08,890
the road too,
so.

1169
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:09,610
Okay.
You.

1170
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,550
So you're,
you're that concerned about it.

1171
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:14,130
Okay.
So now tell me how many,

1172
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:17,760
how many members are,
if you don't have to discuss any of this

1173
00:54:17,761 --> 00:54:22,761
obviously,
but how many members of Heterodox 

1174
00:54:22,761 --> 00:54:22,761
Academy are there now?
We have 1300 members,

1175
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,800
so once we opened up.
So originally it was just for 

1176
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:27,800
researchers who were studying this 
problem,

1177
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,150
but we had lots of people wanting to 
join and so we said,

1178
00:54:30,151 --> 00:54:30,570
well,
okay,

1179
00:54:30,571 --> 00:54:31,020
why not?

1180
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,160
And so we just said,
right,

1181
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:34,740
if as long as you're a professor that 
is,

1182
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:37,440
you have a phd,
you're living more or less the life of a

1183
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,150
professor,
you have a university affiliation.

1184
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:42,060
So we now take adjuncts.
If they have a phd,

1185
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,300
we take postdocs.
Basically if you're in the guild,

1186
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:50,630
if you're living the life of a professor
and you're concerned about the rise of 

1187
00:54:52,561 --> 00:54:53,850
intimidation,
frankly,

1188
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,930
if you're concerned that our wonderful 
institution I love,

1189
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:03,350
I love being a professor,
I love the academy and I feel like it's 

1190
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:06,780
not just losing public respect,
it's losing its ability to function.

1191
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:10,350
It's losing its ability to teach and do 
research on politicized topics,

1192
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:13,140
so there were more politicized topics 
all the time.

1193
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:13,980
That's.
That's right,

1194
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:15,420
and there are a few in the natural 
sciences,

1195
00:55:15,421 --> 00:55:20,421
not many,
but there are some in the natural 

1196
00:55:20,421 --> 00:55:20,421
sciences as well.
Anyway,

1197
00:55:20,421 --> 00:55:23,300
my point is we're now growing very 
rapidly and something I'm very excited 

1198
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,271
by is since we started having more 
violence on campus with beginning with 

1199
00:55:26,271 --> 00:55:30,740
birth and Middlebury,
we're seeing a pervasive sense among 

1200
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:34,340
people on the left that there really is 
this problem here that something has to 

1201
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:37,110
be done and so we are finding much more 
acceptance now.

1202
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:42,260
I'm from professors on the left,
so I like to think about there's the 

1203
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:42,840
liberal left,
which is the great majority,

1204
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:48,140
and there's the illiberal left.
We did a factor analysis of politically 

1205
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:51,090
correct beliefs and found exactly that 
and that the and that the illiberal left

1206
00:55:51,091 --> 00:55:53,520
was also high in orderliness.
That's interesting.

1207
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:55,080
Just the authoritarian.
Exactly.

1208
00:55:55,140 --> 00:56:00,140
Predisposition and also kind of markedly
declined was also characterized by a 

1209
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:03,960
market,
lack of verbal intelligence.

1210
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,940
Oh,
that's point four.

1211
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:08,120
Well that.
Oh,

1212
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:09,210
that's beautiful.
That's beautiful.

1213
00:56:09,211 --> 00:56:12,740
Because one of the simplest formulation 
I've heard really great formulation from

1214
00:56:12,741 --> 00:56:17,741
Mark Lilla,
so mark Lilla wrote this fantastic op 

1215
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:20,721
Ed,
the New York Times week after trump was 

1216
00:56:20,721 --> 00:56:21,660
elected saying identity politics is a 
really foolish thing to do.

1217
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:24,580
It pushes lots of people over to trump's
side.

1218
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,380
You have identity politics is part of 
the problem.

1219
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:31,410
Well,
he writes this off Ed and one of his 

1220
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:31,410
fellow professors at Columbia,
I forget how she does it,

1221
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:33,520
but she basically says something about 
the,

1222
00:56:33,521 --> 00:56:35,320
you know,
the mask with eye holes,

1223
00:56:35,321 --> 00:56:36,190
falls from his face,
like,

1224
00:56:36,191 --> 00:56:41,191
you know,
he's a Ku Klux Klan member or something 

1225
00:56:41,191 --> 00:56:41,191
like that.

1226
00:56:41,191 --> 00:56:42,430
And so Lilla Lilla who isn't the 
humanities,

1227
00:56:42,431 --> 00:56:45,640
he's an intellectual historian.
Lilla has this simple formulation.

1228
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:48,340
He says that's a slur,
not an argument.

1229
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:50,590
And once they had that simple 
formulation,

1230
00:56:50,591 --> 00:56:51,490
I realized,
wow,

1231
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:54,280
that's almost all the pushback I've ever
gotten.

1232
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,620
It's somehow,
you know,

1233
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,220
oh,
you know,

1234
00:56:57,221 --> 00:57:01,660
you're winking at Nazis or your comfort 
to me over and over.

1235
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:06,690
I was just,
my neighborhood was just posters with 

1236
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:06,690
all that,
the intimidation.

1237
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,290
So,
so this is really key.

1238
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,220
We're supposed to be all about,
you can say anything you want,

1239
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:14,680
you can make any argument you want,
if you can support it,

1240
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:20,400
if you can back it with reasons.
This is critical thinking and this is 

1241
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:20,400
what we're supposed to train our 
students to do.

1242
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,090
Well,
and not only that you can say anything,

1243
00:57:22,091 --> 00:57:24,460
but you can say it.
There's a boundary on that,

1244
00:57:24,461 --> 00:57:27,520
which especially if you're a scientist,
less so in the humanities,

1245
00:57:27,521 --> 00:57:32,521
but if you're a scientist,
the things you say have to be vetted by 

1246
00:57:32,521 --> 00:57:33,460
people who are going to be critical of 
them.

1247
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,330
Right.
So,

1248
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:39,450
so not only,
not only there's accountability built 

1249
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:39,450
into it.
That's right.

1250
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:41,310
So I didn't mean to say you can say 
whatever you want rant.

1251
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,230
I mean you can put forth any idea you 
want,

1252
00:57:44,231 --> 00:57:49,231
if you can back it up.
What we're seeing with anything 

1253
00:57:49,231 --> 00:57:49,510
politicize is it's not about backing it 
up.

1254
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:54,690
Students are learning rhetorical 
techniques to link their enemies to 

1255
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:55,680
something racist,
sexist,

1256
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:01,200
contemptible sometimes.
And those are the things that are not 

1257
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:06,600
only worthy of being destroyed,
but that you have a moral duty to 

1258
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:06,600
destroy.
Exactly.

1259
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,600
So that's right.
So it's almost like the immune system,

1260
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:13,070
how exactly works,
but there's some cell that tags Acel as 

1261
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:18,240
enemy enemy and once that tag is put on 
the cell that attract other effort that 

1262
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,200
what kind of sell to mob it and so we 
should look into this,

1263
00:58:20,201 --> 00:58:22,510
this metaphor of the immune system,
because once they know,

1264
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:26,650
once you're labeled as a racist,
the students don't have to read you that

1265
00:58:26,651 --> 00:58:28,330
it doesn't matter what you actually say.

1266
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:32,050
You will now be attached to that.
Once you're labeled that way,

1267
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:35,860
if someone defends you,
the label is contagious.

1268
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:41,350
Dynamic.
That's how we know we're in this super 

1269
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:43,360
religious territory of witch hunts that 
if you stand up for someone,

1270
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:45,580
you are tagged and then you will be 
mobbed.

1271
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,360
And that's why there's so much that.
And that's why there's so much cowardice

1272
00:58:49,361 --> 00:58:51,820
on campus among both students and 
faculty.

1273
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:57,030
People are afraid to stand up even if 
the majority think that what's going on 

1274
00:58:57,030 --> 00:59:00,460
is nuts or is unfair.
They're afraid to stand up and that's in

1275
00:59:00,461 --> 00:59:03,160
part due to social media because it's 
just.

1276
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:08,210
I mean,
students today had been raised with 

1277
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:10,570
various platforms that make it easy for 
people to join in attacks,

1278
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:15,590
someone they look at who liked what.
So if in that article we just saw on 

1279
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:19,321
read a,
there was a bit of a counterrevolution 

1280
00:59:19,321 --> 00:59:21,890
and read the students had to get 
together somehow and decide should I 

1281
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:23,630
like that post?
How about if we all liked it at the same

1282
00:59:23,631 --> 00:59:25,010
time,
then we'll get in less trouble.

1283
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:25,330
Okay.

1284
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:27,570
Okay.
So to what degree.

1285
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,270
So let's talk about the aims of the 
Heterodox Academy.

1286
00:59:30,271 --> 00:59:35,271
So you brought people together who are 
in principle interested in a diversity 

1287
00:59:35,611 --> 00:59:40,611
of opinions and but,
but in what manner is that going to be 

1288
00:59:40,611 --> 00:59:41,460
utilized to,
to,

1289
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:46,520
to,
I don't want to use the word combat but 

1290
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,401
to,
but to deal with this emergent problem 

1291
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:49,401
of ideological rigidity in the 
universities.

1292
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:52,670
So two useful concepts here.
One is the emperor's new clothes.

1293
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,260
Um,
we all know that story.

1294
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:58,040
Even if most people,
even if everybody sees this is nuts,

1295
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:59,600
the emperor's walking around with no 
clothes,

1296
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:01,630
they're afraid to say it until one 
person says it.

1297
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,220
So,
and this is also the ash experiment,

1298
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:06,710
everybody says that that line is the 
same as that line.

1299
01:00:06,711 --> 01:00:10,700
It's obviously not true.
If one person says the truth,

1300
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:15,820
then nobody conforms after that.
So the mere presence of a group of 

1301
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:16,250
people who say,
you know what,

1302
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:21,280
we actually need a diversity of opinions
and the fact that on our site we'll 

1303
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,360
publish things.
So sometimes when professors are mob,

1304
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:24,400
like when Bret Weinstein was mobbed,
you know,

1305
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:26,180
so I wrote an essay that stood up for 
him.

1306
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:27,500
Uh,
we've done that for some of them.

1307
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,270
It's happening so fast,
I can't keep up,

1308
01:00:29,271 --> 01:00:30,590
I can't,
I've got books to write and I,

1309
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:32,730
you know,
every week there's some new member who's

1310
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:33,230
getting mobbed.

1311
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:36,140
And so we're going to develop a team of 
people who will write.

1312
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,780
But just knowing that there are people 
who will stand up for you.

1313
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Um,
knowing that there are people who will 

1314
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:44,000
say,
wait a second,

1315
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:44,000
um,
you know,

1316
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,520
this is not what we do in the academy.
So that's one things we just stand up 

1317
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,461
for each other too,
is we develop products that we think can

1318
01:00:52,041 --> 01:00:57,041
basically fix the situation.
So one of our products is called the 

1319
01:00:57,041 --> 01:01:01,031
campus expression survey.
It's a survey designed to actually 

1320
01:01:01,031 --> 01:01:03,590
measure who was afraid of speaking up 
about what topics and why,

1321
01:01:03,591 --> 01:01:08,591
what are they afraid of?
And it turns out everyone's afraid of 

1322
01:01:08,591 --> 01:01:08,591
the students more than the faculty.
Uh,

1323
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,190
they're afraid of mostly to talk about 
race.

1324
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:12,500
What about the administrators?
Everyone's afraid of the students.

1325
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,320
They're afraid of the students.
So I don't have,

1326
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:17,600
we have not sorted them.
I've only surveyed students,

1327
01:01:17,601 --> 01:01:22,601
I don't know,
but from what we hear people are afraid 

1328
01:01:22,601 --> 01:01:24,200
of,
of the students,

1329
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:25,100
um,

1330
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:30,130
hauling in its own manner.
Like was that failure of leadership?

1331
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:35,360
That's for sure.
They let those kids come into the 

1332
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,100
classroom,
the actual classroom and disrupt a class

1333
01:01:36,101 --> 01:01:37,810
on an ongoing basis.
I mean,

1334
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,930
yes,
and I couldn't understand that exactly.

1335
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:45,931
I mean,
my response to that would be first I 

1336
01:01:45,931 --> 01:01:46,720
would tell them to leave.
Second,

1337
01:01:46,721 --> 01:01:48,790
I would call campus security.
Third,

1338
01:01:48,791 --> 01:01:51,190
if something wasn't done about it,
I just wouldn't teach the class.

1339
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:56,400
So I don't understand like it,
it seems to me that it's also up to 

1340
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,611
individual professors to draw a line,
which is that if you're being 

1341
01:01:59,611 --> 01:02:00,370
intimidated dated by students,
why do you,

1342
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,520
why do you show up and teach the class?
I don't understand that.

1343
01:02:03,521 --> 01:02:03,640
Yeah.

1344
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:09,100
So again,
people are afraid to stand up if it 

1345
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,070
means that people will call you a racist

1346
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:11,370
cabot garden.
I mean,

1347
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,390
it's weird in that situation though 
because it's carried to enroll her to go

1348
01:02:15,391 --> 01:02:16,740
to your class,
you know,

1349
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:21,860
and,
and there's a much more proximal 

1350
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:21,860
threats.
That's what I mean.

1351
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:21,860
That's what I'm most alarming

1352
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:25,910
by is the rise of intimidation.
Intimidation is now a factor in many 

1353
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,290
aspects of academic life and that's just
terrible.

1354
01:02:27,291 --> 01:02:31,010
That's completely incompatible with,
with what we do and who we are.

1355
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:32,230
Well,
it's especially,

1356
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:37,290
it's especially appalling given that 
whatever happens in the university 

1357
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:40,510
campuses,
one of the Christians I'd faced in 

1358
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:42,961
Canada as well,
why should we care about what's 

1359
01:02:42,961 --> 01:02:45,571
happening in the,
in the Ivy Tower is going to hire these 

1360
01:02:45,571 --> 01:02:45,571
people next year.
You are.

1361
01:02:45,571 --> 01:02:45,571
Well,
yeah.

1362
01:02:45,571 --> 01:02:50,521
Well,
it's the heart like what's happening in 

1363
01:02:50,521 --> 01:02:50,521
the campus is going to happen in society
in five years.

1364
01:02:50,521 --> 01:02:51,940
It's already,
it's already happened.

1365
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:53,550
This is actually an important point.
Um,

1366
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:54,670
I've,
I just gave a talk,

1367
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:58,580
get a at a big law firm here in New York
where they're very devoted to diversity,

1368
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:00,830
but they're doing it right.
They're really thinking about diversity.

1369
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:05,860
Why is diversity good?
And say have a whole month on viewpoint 

1370
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:05,860
diversity,
which is just fantastic.

1371
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:10,450
And what I'm learning from talking to a 
number of people in the business world 

1372
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:14,440
is that in the last year they're now all
these pressures on leaders to endorse 

1373
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:19,991
this condemned that sign,
this open letter and through human 

1374
01:03:19,991 --> 01:03:20,180
resources.
That's right.

1375
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:25,360
That's right.
But it's the same dynamic we have on 

1376
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:25,490
campus and the answer to it.
So if anybody,

1377
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,290
anybody watching here,
if you run a business,

1378
01:03:27,291 --> 01:03:29,630
if you have friends who are in business,
I think the only,

1379
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:30,280
the,
the,

1380
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,140
the,
there are only two stable equilibria.

1381
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:37,540
One is that every organization is just 
either all right when we're all left 

1382
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:37,540
wing,
but that will be disastrous.

1383
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:38,960
So either you just say,
okay,

1384
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:44,020
we're on one side that we terrible.
The other is what we call the Chicago 

1385
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:48,071
principles of free expression.
The University of Chicago has the best 

1386
01:03:48,071 --> 01:03:51,371
statement out there on how the 
university provides a platform on which 

1387
01:03:51,371 --> 01:03:55,040
multiple views can contest the 
university does not take anyone's side.

1388
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:57,860
That's the only other stable 
alternative.

1389
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:00,560
And I think leaders need to do this in 
business.

1390
01:04:00,561 --> 01:04:03,350
It certainly universities.
So we're encouraging every university to

1391
01:04:03,351 --> 01:04:07,530
adopt the Chicago principles because a 
lot of what mass action is,

1392
01:04:07,531 --> 01:04:12,531
is an attempt to compel the authority to
come in on your side and punish your 

1393
01:04:12,531 --> 01:04:12,900
enemies.
Yep.

1394
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:15,180
And so that has to stop.
We can go how,

1395
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:18,270
how effectively is the Chicago statement
on,

1396
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:22,470
on how effectively is the Chicago 
statement being disseminated?

1397
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,810
How rapidly our universities signing up

1398
01:04:24,860 --> 01:04:26,060
or,
or um,

1399
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:29,210
there a few signed on early in this 
whole crisis.

1400
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:32,520
I'm a purdue,
they're about 10 or 15 that have,

1401
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:34,370
that have endorsed it or something like 
it.

1402
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:39,800
Uh,
it's not enough to just endorse 

1403
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,441
something,
but if you have leadership that's 

1404
01:04:41,441 --> 01:04:43,430
committed to creating an open platform 
in which people can disagree.

1405
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:44,310
Um,
and I,

1406
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:49,500
and one sense very encouraging,
I've been invited by a number of 

1407
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,380
university presidents to come speak.
We have all kinds of,

1408
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:56,480
of innovation to Heterodox Academy to 
foster a more inclusive climate in which

1409
01:04:56,481 --> 01:04:59,390
people can actually engage with 
difference.

1410
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:04,870
There's a lot of interests.
So I think the university leaders were 

1411
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:07,901
very slow to react.
They didn't want to alienate certain 

1412
01:05:07,901 --> 01:05:11,411
factions of students,
but they're almost all reasonable 

1413
01:05:11,411 --> 01:05:12,260
people.
They're almost all liberal left.

1414
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:15,560
I'm not illiberal.
They're horrified by what's going on.

1415
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:17,210
They know they're sitting on top of a 
powder.

1416
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:21,550
They don't want things to blow up in 
their face as happened at Evergreen.

1417
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:23,740
So this brings us to our,
our,

1418
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:24,820
our,
another product,

1419
01:05:24,821 --> 01:05:28,210
the one that we're most excited by a.
So I just went online,

1420
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:28,930
uh,
actually,

1421
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:29,800
uh,
today,

1422
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,560
uh,
it's called the open mind platform.

1423
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:37,561
If you go to open mind platform.org,
you can find we've developed a,

1424
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:43,570
an APP.
We have a whole library of readings and 

1425
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:44,890
videos who developed an APP that guides 
you through.

1426
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:50,250
We don't just say,
here's how engaged with different 

1427
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:51,630
viewpoints.
We start by saying why is it good and we

1428
01:05:51,631 --> 01:05:54,010
make the case that you need this.
Everybody needs this.

1429
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:55,960
And to,
um,

1430
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:00,310
we remind people that we're all 
basically self righteous hypocrites.

1431
01:06:00,311 --> 01:06:05,311
We have quotes from wisdom traditions 
around the world and we've all heard 

1432
01:06:05,311 --> 01:06:05,311
this.
So just a little bit of a,

1433
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:10,500
you know,
you can call it emotional manipulation 

1434
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,001
if you like,
but just get people into a mindset in 

1435
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:12,430
which they're willing to say,
oh yeah,

1436
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:13,930
Whoa,
calm down.

1437
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:16,960
We're all,
we're all a on to self righteous here.

1438
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,410
And then we,
then we teach them some psychology about

1439
01:06:20,411 --> 01:06:23,980
motivated reasoning and only then do we 
teach them to engage with views that are

1440
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:27,680
not their own.
So we've already run this in about 15 to

1441
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:28,970
20 classes.
Um,

1442
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:31,450
the results so far look promising that 
at the end of it,

1443
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,940
the measures show that students are more
open to other ideas.

1444
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:39,270
So the open my platform,
do you think is a tool that we think a 

1445
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:40,530
lot of universities are going to adopt 
their.

1446
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:41,560
There's a lot of interest in it.

1447
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:47,950
If there's leadership,
if the professors generally do support 

1448
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:51,850
viewpoint diversity and open inquiry.
If we change freshmen orientation so 

1449
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:55,430
that students are trained first and 
foremost in how to step back,

1450
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:57,920
give people the benefit of the doubt,
be open minded.

1451
01:06:57,921 --> 01:07:02,180
If we do that first,
you know that's like behavioral exposure

1452
01:07:02,181 --> 01:07:03,140
to some degree,
right?

1453
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:08,170
The idea would be that if you're,
if you're afraid or disgusted by 

1454
01:07:08,170 --> 01:07:11,210
something that you don't understand the 
appropriate treatment,

1455
01:07:11,211 --> 01:07:16,211
first of all,
the treatment is necessary because 

1456
01:07:16,211 --> 01:07:18,131
otherwise you'll isolate yourself in the
ways that you already described and 

1457
01:07:18,131 --> 01:07:18,770
second,
that brief exposure.

1458
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:21,570
Voluntary exposure's going to be the 
best curative.

1459
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:25,750
That's the opposite of the safe space.
Id exactly need to be protected.

1460
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:30,830
Safe space.
The safe space idea is the worst thing 

1461
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:30,830
you could possibly do for the very 
people you're trying to.

1462
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:31,970
Exactly.
Exactly mean to psychology,

1463
01:07:31,971 --> 01:07:36,971
what you know,
the psychology behind safe spaces and 

1464
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:40,151
microaggressions is just the exact 
opposite of what we should be doing if 

1465
01:07:40,151 --> 01:07:41,540
we want to create kids,
especially black kids,

1466
01:07:41,541 --> 01:07:43,510
gay kids,
we made whatever.

1467
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,550
If you think that they are vulnerable to
more stigma,

1468
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:49,100
more conflict if you think that they are
vulnerable,

1469
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:54,160
that's especially when a safe space will
be temporarily pleasant,

1470
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:55,530
but in the long run,
bad for.

1471
01:07:55,640 --> 01:08:00,640
Right.
And that's the critical issue too with 

1472
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,531
regards to safe spaces is that there are
sacrificing the medium and longterm of 

1473
01:08:02,531 --> 01:08:07,280
the students' wellbeing,
let's say to the short term lack of fear

1474
01:08:07,281 --> 01:08:09,770
and conflict.
Their infant dialyzing them essentially.

1475
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,690
So yeah.
Okay.

1476
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:12,920
So.
Alright,

1477
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:18,040
so I was thinking about discussion idea.
I've got a personality test online now 

1478
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:21,410
that's based on this big five aspect 
scale,

1479
01:08:21,411 --> 01:08:24,830
but it might be interesting as something
for us to think about to do,

1480
01:08:24,831 --> 01:08:29,831
find people who are high in openness and
low in conscientiousness or orderliness 

1481
01:08:29,831 --> 01:08:34,330
and offer them the opportunity to engage
in dialogue with people who have the 

1482
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:35,410
opposite personality traits.
No,

1483
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:36,680
because,
well,

1484
01:08:36,681 --> 01:08:38,300
first of all,
because they're going to run into people

1485
01:08:38,301 --> 01:08:39,580
like that always,
right.

1486
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:40,530
And,
and,

1487
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:45,630
and,
and maybe even establish a relationship 

1488
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:47,630
with them inadvertently.
And so being able to tolerate that might

1489
01:08:47,631 --> 01:08:52,631
give them the kind of insight that you 
said you developed when you realized 

1490
01:08:52,631 --> 01:08:55,751
that the conservative ethos was based on
a reasonable but not complete set of,

1491
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,870
of,
of beneficial axiomatic presuppositions.

1492
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,640
So.
Alright,

1493
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:04,100
so now this is pretty much taken over 
your life,

1494
01:09:04,101 --> 01:09:07,010
this heterodox academy as well as the 
writing.

1495
01:09:07,011 --> 01:09:08,450
Now you're writing a couple of new 
books.

1496
01:09:08,451 --> 01:09:09,690
I understand.
Yeah.

1497
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:11,090
So,
um,

1498
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,490
so since,
so I was in the psychology department at

1499
01:09:13,491 --> 01:09:18,110
the University of Virginia for a,
for 17 years and one of my book,

1500
01:09:18,111 --> 01:09:23,111
the righteous mind was coming out.
I wanted to move to New York City for a 

1501
01:09:23,111 --> 01:09:24,830
year so I could do promotional work for 
it and I just had,

1502
01:09:24,831 --> 01:09:29,831
my second child was just born and I knew
it would be hard to fly from 

1503
01:09:29,831 --> 01:09:30,620
Charlottesville.
So I just happened to get a position,

1504
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:32,840
temporary position here at Stern,
at the business school.

1505
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:38,280
Um,
and when I first arrived I wasn't that 

1506
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:38,280
interested in business,
um,

1507
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,430
but as soon as I got here,
occupy Wall Street happened and suddenly

1508
01:09:40,431 --> 01:09:43,760
it was like everyone's talking about 
morality and politics and capitalism and

1509
01:09:43,761 --> 01:09:48,761
business.
And then I started learning about the 

1510
01:09:48,761 --> 01:09:50,891
history of capitalism and I knew nothing
about it was fascinating and I started 

1511
01:09:50,891 --> 01:09:54,120
seeing how free enterprise free markets 
have helped raise,

1512
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:56,270
wait,
raise living standards around the world.

1513
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:56,710
Yes.

1514
01:09:57,490 --> 01:10:02,480
Poverty in a staggeringly rapid fashion 
that's completely unprecedented threat,

1515
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,090
especially since the year 2000.

1516
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:05,520
That's right.
So since,

1517
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:06,280
so,
you know,

1518
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:11,290
here I was 48 years old discovering it,
nothing about it was like when I first 

1519
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:11,780
learned about evolution,
like wow,

1520
01:10:11,781 --> 01:10:16,070
this explains everything in the natural 
world and learning about capitalism.

1521
01:10:16,071 --> 01:10:21,071
Business explained everything about the 
built world and the world that we 

1522
01:10:21,071 --> 01:10:21,110
actually live in.
Um,

1523
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:24,170
and they were also all these business 
scandals.

1524
01:10:24,171 --> 01:10:29,171
This was 2011 and the wake of the 
financial crisis and I saw a huge 

1525
01:10:29,171 --> 01:10:33,010
opening to begin applying moral 
psychology to help corporations have 

1526
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:34,180
better ethics.
Um,

1527
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:39,250
so I've been,
everything I do involves applying moral 

1528
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:39,920
psychology to help complex systems work 
better,

1529
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:45,040
so I've been focused on political 
polarization and governance for years 

1530
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,251
before then and that led to the 
righteous mind and then I got here to 

1531
01:10:48,251 --> 01:10:52,181
Stern,
they offered me a job during that first 

1532
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:52,181
year and I took it and it's been 
fantastic.

1533
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:52,700
It's been really exciting.
It's like a whole new,

1534
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,700
almost like being back in Grad school,
a whole bunch of new things to learn.

1535
01:10:55,830 --> 01:11:00,830
You must be a kind of a shock and 
existential shock to be in a business 

1536
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:00,830
school in some sense.
No,

1537
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:01,280
it's not,
it's not a shock.

1538
01:11:01,281 --> 01:11:06,281
I mean it's a different culture.
It's much more open in the sense that 

1539
01:11:06,281 --> 01:11:06,890
it's so diverse like the things people 
are doing,

1540
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:12,130
there's not like a way that we do things
here and it's much more open to applied 

1541
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:13,470
projects to actually to applied 
projects.

1542
01:11:13,471 --> 01:11:14,940
Yeah.
And so it was a perfect time for me.

1543
01:11:14,941 --> 01:11:15,660
Like I just,
you know,

1544
01:11:15,661 --> 01:11:20,661
the righteous mind that,
that wraps up like the first half of my 

1545
01:11:20,661 --> 01:11:23,181
career,
like everything I did is in that book 

1546
01:11:23,181 --> 01:11:25,580
and now it's time for something new and 
that new thing was going to be I'm 

1547
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:29,240
looking at how morality or moral 
psychology both underlines or,

1548
01:11:29,241 --> 01:11:34,241
or,
or is the foundation for our ability to 

1549
01:11:34,241 --> 01:11:34,590
do capitalism like contracts,
reciprocity,

1550
01:11:34,591 --> 01:11:35,220
all sorts of things.

1551
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:36,750
And how are left,
right?

1552
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:38,110
Divide,
um,

1553
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,610
from the righteous mind makes it hard 
for us to figure out what's true.

1554
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:45,150
Like if you're raised the minimum wage,
does that help or hurt the working poor?

1555
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:46,860
Right.
If you're an economist on the left,

1556
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:48,570
obviously helps them.
If you're on the right,

1557
01:11:48,571 --> 01:11:53,571
it obviously hurts them because fewer of
them have jobs and you can gerrymander 

1558
01:11:53,571 --> 01:11:55,590
the measurement devices to reduce the 
conclusions that you want,

1559
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:57,210
which is a big problem.
That's right.

1560
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,480
So I'm supposed to be writing a book 
called three stories about capitalism,

1561
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:05,630
the moral psychology of economic life.
And so I started traveling around the 

1562
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:08,250
world looking at how development is 
going in various countries.

1563
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:13,440
Uh,
I did a three month trip to Asia in 

1564
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:13,440
2015.
I came back from Asia,

1565
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,140
my article came out with [inaudible] off
the colony,

1566
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:18,210
American mind.
The bbs article was published,

1567
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:19,170
uh,
and I thought,

1568
01:12:19,171 --> 01:12:20,330
okay,
now we can get back to this,

1569
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:21,840
you know,
keep it in this capitalism book.

1570
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:26,900
And then the university is kind of began
melting down in the fall and then we 

1571
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:27,450
started heterodox academy.
And so yes,

1572
01:12:27,451 --> 01:12:28,770
it has taken over my life.
It's,

1573
01:12:28,771 --> 01:12:32,930
it's basically a full time job in 
addition to trying to write the.

1574
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:38,120
I'm also working on,
so looking on it and I didn't want to 

1575
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:41,480
turn our article into a book because we 
thought we'd said everything but men 

1576
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:45,411
have things been happening fast and 
we've learned so much more since we 

1577
01:12:45,411 --> 01:12:45,480
wrote that article and that article 
when,

1578
01:12:45,481 --> 01:12:46,020
how long?
Well,

1579
01:12:46,021 --> 01:12:51,021
we wrote it in late 2014 and then we 
edit it in early 2015 and it finally 

1580
01:12:51,021 --> 01:12:52,740
came out in August of 2015.
Um,

1581
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:55,290
and so in our last October,
Greg,

1582
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,490
uh,
wrote to me and said,

1583
01:12:56,491 --> 01:13:01,491
John,
I think I do want to turn the article 

1584
01:13:01,491 --> 01:13:01,491
into a book because we know so much more
now and it's,

1585
01:13:01,491 --> 01:13:04,110
the problem is so much more serious than
it was any evidence.

1586
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:06,420
My God,
the evidence about mental,

1587
01:13:06,421 --> 01:13:09,690
the mental health crisis of adolescence 
when Greg and I wrote the article,

1588
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:10,680
we were,
you know,

1589
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:15,890
we saw lots of hints that depression and
anxiety were going way up and we think 

1590
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:17,910
that's related to the,
the overprotection yeah,

1591
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:18,480
part two.
Okay.

1592
01:13:18,481 --> 01:13:20,370
So let's,
let's talk about that just for a sec and

1593
01:13:20,371 --> 01:13:25,371
then go back to the book.
So I've got a potential demographic 

1594
01:13:25,371 --> 01:13:25,650
explanation for that in part.
Well,

1595
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:27,780
and I don't know if you guys have looked
into this or not.

1596
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:28,920
Well,
there's,

1597
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:31,710
there's two things that I think might be
contributing to it.

1598
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:38,540
One is two or three things.
One is the average age at which children

1599
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:43,140
are the average age at which people have
children has gone way up.

1600
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:43,830
That's true.
Okay.

1601
01:13:43,831 --> 01:13:48,831
So why does that matter?
We're all because I think people get 

1602
01:13:48,831 --> 01:13:49,080
more conservative and cautious as they 
get older a little bit,

1603
01:13:49,081 --> 01:13:51,510
but that's true,
but it's a very small effect and it's,

1604
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:54,000
wait a second,
it's the having of the kids,

1605
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:55,560
which is what makes them more 
conservative.

1606
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:58,260
When you have kids,
you are more threat sensitive,

1607
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,060
you're more likely to vote for the right
wing party.

1608
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:04,350
So just delaying child,
child a childbirth wouldn't.

1609
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:05,310
Okay.
What about,

1610
01:14:05,311 --> 01:14:07,260
what about fewer siblings?
That would.

1611
01:14:07,261 --> 01:14:08,610
Yes.
That's part of it.

1612
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:13,980
Uh,
and this is what we're seeing in Asia 

1613
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:13,980
too,
when you have a lot of kids,

1614
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:17,940
you're not quite as worried.
You don't have all your eggs in one 

1615
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:17,940
basket.
Well,

1616
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:19,090
and you can't quite as worried and the 
siblings raised each other.

1617
01:14:19,091 --> 01:14:19,720
That's right.
Right.

1618
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:23,080
And then there's a lot of keystrokes 
fight.

1619
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:25,360
Exactly.
It's the free play and the fighting,

1620
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:28,960
the working things out for themselves.
Those are essential skills of adulthood.

1621
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:29,680
Okay.
So see,

1622
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:30,620
so then.
Alright.

1623
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:32,850
So smaller family sizes.
Part of it.

1624
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:33,490
Agree.
Well,

1625
01:14:33,491 --> 01:14:38,491
and then also what's happening 
increasingly in schools is that kids 

1626
01:14:38,491 --> 01:14:39,840
aren't allowed free play and there are 
certain not even allowed.

1627
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:42,850
Rough and tumble free play,
which that's right.

1628
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:47,910
That's one of the biggest things about.
So the two that there are three giant 

1629
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:47,910
there.
There are a lot of.

1630
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:51,490
I mean this is such actually it's really
fun puzzle because it's like the biggest

1631
01:14:51,491 --> 01:14:56,491
social science puzzle of our age.
What is happening that's making so many 

1632
01:14:56,491 --> 01:14:57,820
of our systems go haywire and I'm 
focusing on the university.

1633
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,790
The big three I would say are one is the
loss of,

1634
01:15:00,850 --> 01:15:02,810
of free,
of unsupervised freeplay.

1635
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Yeah.
And Peter Gray has been brilliant on 

1636
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,411
this.
He's a Boston college showing how even 

1637
01:15:10,411 --> 01:15:10,890
among young animals they have to 
practice the skills for adulthood.

1638
01:15:10,891 --> 01:15:11,560
Yeah.
And getting in,

1639
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,330
showing that too.
Exactly.

1640
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:18,600
So getting in conflicts and then dealing
with it and sometimes losing and you 

1641
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:23,401
come back having game in which there's a
problem but you have to work it out or 

1642
01:15:23,401 --> 01:15:23,401
the game stars.

1643
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:26,170
That's what kids always did.
It's only recently in the nine,

1644
01:15:26,171 --> 01:15:31,171
beginning in the nineties that it 
they're always supervised because we're 

1645
01:15:31,171 --> 01:15:32,350
afraid if we take our eyes off them 
there'll be kidnapped and that was never

1646
01:15:32,351 --> 01:15:33,630
a risk was never a risk.
You know,

1647
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:38,640
I've kind of wondered about this gender 
flexibility issue as a form of delayed 

1648
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,130
fantasy play.
Good.

1649
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:43,420
And let me go ahead.
Because it looks to me like that is,

1650
01:15:43,421 --> 01:15:45,550
you know,
when kids are little and three and four,

1651
01:15:45,551 --> 01:15:50,551
say three to seven,
they do a tremendous amount of identity 

1652
01:15:50,551 --> 01:15:50,551
play,
you know,

1653
01:15:50,551 --> 01:15:52,810
they pretend they're animals,
they pretend they're their parents,

1654
01:15:52,811 --> 01:15:53,240
they,
they,

1655
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:54,790
they,
they pretend they're girls.

1656
01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:56,260
If they're boys,
they pretend they're boys.

1657
01:15:56,261 --> 01:15:59,500
If they're girls like they really do a 
tremendous amount of identity play.

1658
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:02,440
And one of the things that's been really
puzzling me is,

1659
01:16:02,441 --> 01:16:04,120
well,
what happens if that isn't,

1660
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:09,750
um,
if they never have an opportunity for 

1661
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:09,750
that because they're not engaging in 
fantasy play,

1662
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:10,930
maybe it's just delayed till adulthood.

1663
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:11,890
Oh,
that's interesting.

1664
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:17,100
So because plate,
it's almost impossible to overstate the 

1665
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:20,071
importance of that rough and tumble play
and then the fantasy play that enables 

1666
01:16:20,071 --> 01:16:24,391
you to adopt different identities.
And then the negotiated games that you 

1667
01:16:24,391 --> 01:16:25,930
talked about that enabled people to 
handle both,

1668
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:27,970
both victory,
but even more importantly,

1669
01:16:27,971 --> 01:16:28,930
last.
That's right.

1670
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:31,060
So that's possible.
That could well be.

1671
01:16:31,061 --> 01:16:32,670
I know that I have no,
no opinion on,

1672
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:35,950
but the big three factors that I think 
are explaining,

1673
01:16:35,951 --> 01:16:38,500
explaining part of what's happening on 
campus are one,

1674
01:16:38,501 --> 01:16:42,280
the loss of the unsupervised place so 
that the kids have always,

1675
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:47,310
there's always an adult present and so 
they come to college and they expect 

1676
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:47,310
there to be an adult and dean somebody 
if there's a conflict.

1677
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:52,410
That's one.
Two is social media which hit just as 

1678
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:53,020
ign,
ign,

1679
01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:55,120
Internet generation.
This is Jean twinkies work,

1680
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:56,200
you know,
we used to,

1681
01:16:56,230 --> 01:17:01,230
we used to think that I'm a,
we used to think that the millennial 

1682
01:17:01,301 --> 01:17:06,301
generation ends in 1998 or 2000,
but gene 20 shows a looking at for large

1683
01:17:07,271 --> 01:17:12,271
data sets that birth year 1995 kids born
in 1995 and after are really different.

1684
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:18,640
They're values are different.
They have much higher rates of anxiety 

1685
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,700
and depression,
especially the girls.

1686
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:20,530
Boys have gone up,
grows,

1687
01:17:20,531 --> 01:17:22,610
gone way up.
Um,

1688
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:26,480
and the reason seems to be that facebook
lowered its age.

1689
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:27,540
Um,
uh,

1690
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:32,670
so in 2005 you had to be a college 
student at a certain number of colleges 

1691
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:37,751
to get facebook in 2006,
you can be any 11 year old who lies and 

1692
01:17:38,001 --> 01:17:40,220
says that she's 13 and you've got a 
facebook account,

1693
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:42,140
um,
uh,

1694
01:17:42,141 --> 01:17:44,060
but then you're using on your parent's 
pc,

1695
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:49,420
it's in 2007.
The iphone comes out and it saturates 

1696
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:50,570
the market faster than any consumer 
product ever has.

1697
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:52,490
So by 2000,
10 or 11,

1698
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:57,790
a lot of adolescents have have facebook 
and other social platforms and this is 

1699
01:17:58,881 --> 01:18:02,450
just devastating especially to girls 
because it's not texting.

1700
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:04,400
Texting is just me to you,
you know,

1701
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:05,990
that's back and forth.
That's fine that,

1702
01:18:05,991 --> 01:18:06,290
you know,
we,

1703
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:07,850
when we were kids,
you called your friends on the phone,

1704
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:08,540
that's fine.

1705
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:10,750
The problem seems to be according to 
twinkie,

1706
01:18:10,751 --> 01:18:15,110
it's especially platforms in which he 
puts something out and then you wait and

1707
01:18:15,111 --> 01:18:20,111
see what everyone says and that 
especially as damaging to girls who 

1708
01:18:20,111 --> 01:18:21,920
already are at risk of eating disorders 
and image disorders.

1709
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:26,210
So girls become more susceptible to 
negative emotion when they hit puberty.

1710
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:26,610
Well,
there,

1711
01:18:26,611 --> 01:18:27,680
there,
yes,

1712
01:18:27,681 --> 01:18:28,790
yes.
That's always been the case.

1713
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:31,520
Then there's another issue too with 
regards to female aggression.

1714
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:36,940
So no,
it's clearly the case that males are 

1715
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:40,370
more likely to be physically damaging 
slash aggressive than females are.

1716
01:18:40,371 --> 01:18:43,280
But what females use his reputation 
savaging.

1717
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:44,130
That's right.
So that's Nikki.

1718
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:49,590
Nikki crikey passed away a couple of 
years ago showed that if you add it all 

1719
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:50,000
up,
boys and girls equally aggressive,

1720
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:52,040
but the boys aggression is more 
physical.

1721
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:53,060
The girls,
the more relational.

1722
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:58,480
So if you imagine a bunch of 13,
14 year olds in their middle schools and

1723
01:18:58,611 --> 01:19:00,830
then you parachute in a whole bunch of 
iphones,

1724
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:02,670
everybody's got one of their pots in it 
before.

1725
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:07,870
What are the boys going to do?
They're going to play video games and 

1726
01:19:07,870 --> 01:19:10,121
that doesn't hurt anybody,
but the girls are going to use it to 

1727
01:19:10,121 --> 01:19:12,380
amplify the social interactions.
So this is 20 twinkies explanation.

1728
01:19:12,381 --> 01:19:13,760
I think it makes a lot of sense.
So it's a,

1729
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:16,610
it's a catastrophe.
It's a crisis and we're really hurting,

1730
01:19:16,611 --> 01:19:18,030
especially the girls.
Um,

1731
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,390
so we've got to change something about 
that anyway.

1732
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:25,540
But social media is,
is possibly the largest single reason 

1733
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:27,630
why things are going haywire on campus.
The third big factor in,

1734
01:19:27,631 --> 01:19:30,110
and do you think it's primarily facebook
or can you tell?

1735
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:30,650
Well,
it's,

1736
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:31,630
it's uh,
uh,

1737
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,500
the kids use a lot of different 
platforms,

1738
01:19:33,501 --> 01:19:35,630
but from what I hear,
instagram,

1739
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:38,030
facebook,
snapchat,

1740
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:38,750
it.
Again,

1741
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:42,350
the thing is it's one to many.
That's what's bad at anything if,

1742
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:43,340
if it's,
if it's,

1743
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:46,100
you put something out there and you see 
how many people like it,

1744
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:47,020
that's what's right.

1745
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:49,730
And there's always the threat that it'll
go viral in a terrible way.

1746
01:19:49,731 --> 01:19:54,731
So that's exactly the sort of damage 
limit that's perfectly limited damage.

1747
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:57,740
Unlimited downside to saying something.
So what do you do?

1748
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:58,650
Careful.
Right?

1749
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:01,910
So I don't know if I want to like that 
post because you know,

1750
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:03,330
I could get in big trouble for it.
Right?

1751
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:08,410
Well the benefit to liking it as minimal
and the potential catastrophe for this 

1752
01:20:08,410 --> 01:20:11,830
unless expected to like it,
in which case you'd better like it 

1753
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:11,830
because if you don't like it you'll get 
in trouble.

1754
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:14,550
So it's a much more of a mob mentality.
Kids are afraid,

1755
01:20:14,551 --> 01:20:15,750
you know,
I'm not blaming the kids,

1756
01:20:15,751 --> 01:20:17,040
I'm very sympathetic to them and these 
are,

1757
01:20:17,041 --> 01:20:19,620
my kids are,
my kids are 11 and seven,

1758
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:21,450
they're going to come up into this.
Um,

1759
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,330
so the kids have been raised in a,
in a social environment,

1760
01:20:24,331 --> 01:20:29,331
it's much more about mob mob formation 
and mob attacks and Bob defend defenses 

1761
01:20:29,331 --> 01:20:29,880
against mobs.

1762
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,660
Um,
and then,

1763
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:36,760
so the third factor then is the 
political polarization and that 

1764
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:39,821
purification or institutions.
So if you imagine coming up in the 

1765
01:20:39,821 --> 01:20:41,010
nineties when political polarization is 
going up,

1766
01:20:41,011 --> 01:20:43,290
we're beginning to hate each other more 
across party lines,

1767
01:20:43,291 --> 01:20:45,200
but it's not that hard.
Not that,

1768
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:47,220
that nasty,
but it's been getting much,

1769
01:20:47,221 --> 01:20:49,890
much more hostile so that now if 
someone,

1770
01:20:49,891 --> 01:20:50,560
like,
if someone's a,

1771
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:55,570
is,
if someone goes to a campus Republicans 

1772
01:20:55,570 --> 01:20:55,620
meeting,
if it's a Democrat who goes to a meeting

1773
01:20:55,621 --> 01:21:00,621
of the campus,
Republicans has happened at UC Santa 

1774
01:21:00,621 --> 01:21:00,621
Cruz a couple weeks ago,
um,

1775
01:21:00,621 --> 01:21:01,620
uh,
and someone finds out,

1776
01:21:01,621 --> 01:21:02,080
you know,
the.

1777
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:03,380
So the,
the,

1778
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:04,650
the,
the hatred,

1779
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:07,830
the cross-party hatred is so much 
stronger now.

1780
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:13,250
And many institutions are much pure.
So if you went to college in the 

1781
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:16,911
nineties,
there might've been a few conservative 

1782
01:21:16,911 --> 01:21:16,911
professors around,
but now there aren't.

1783
01:21:16,911 --> 01:21:21,590
So as you said before,
it's like exposure therapy if you've 

1784
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:21,590
never encountered a conservative idea.

1785
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:24,420
And then if conservative like Heather 
Mcdonald comes to speak on your campus,

1786
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:26,700
well this is like a major immune 
response problem.

1787
01:21:26,701 --> 01:21:29,670
We've got to get the tribe together and 
mob her and you know,

1788
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,680
shut her down.
Um,

1789
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:34,320
so those are the.
I mean there are many other reasons,

1790
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:39,000
but the loss of unsupervised play,
social media and rice and polarization,

1791
01:21:39,001 --> 01:21:40,350
those are the three big ones,
right?

1792
01:21:40,351 --> 01:21:45,351
Well those are big problems,
especially the loss of unsupervised 

1793
01:21:45,351 --> 01:21:45,351
play.
It's not,

1794
01:21:45,351 --> 01:21:46,650
it's not obvious at all how that might 
be addressed.

1795
01:21:46,651 --> 01:21:47,680
Yes it is.
Okay,

1796
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:48,390
good.
Good.

1797
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:51,950
Everyone should,
just by Lenore skenazy,

1798
01:21:51,951 --> 01:21:56,951
his book,
free range kids and then they should 

1799
01:21:56,951 --> 01:21:57,750
loosen up and give their kids more 
unsupervised time.

1800
01:21:57,751 --> 01:22:00,720
Now you can't do this alone.
You'll be arrested.

1801
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:03,750
I tried to get my son to go out across 
the street to,

1802
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:08,940
you know,
buy groceries when he was nine years 

1803
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:08,940
old.

1804
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:08,940
And he'd say,
look,

1805
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:08,940
but you know,
Daddy,

1806
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:10,950
people look at me funny there,
there are other kids out there.

1807
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:16,280
Um,
and so lenore has started a fantastic 

1808
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:19,761
organization called let grow.
So if you were to let grow.org,

1809
01:22:19,931 --> 01:22:21,870
okay,
we'll put all this in the description,

1810
01:22:21,871 --> 01:22:22,820
all of these things,
right?

1811
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:25,350
So I'm on the board of it as an advisor.
Peter Gray,

1812
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:26,150
uh,
expert on,

1813
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:29,940
on play is on the board and they're 
doing these simple things.

1814
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Simple,
simple things like you convinced the 

1815
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,941
school to just open up the playground an
hour early or keep it open after school.

1816
01:22:40,110 --> 01:22:43,290
Why should kids always have organized 
activities and soccer practice?

1817
01:22:43,410 --> 01:22:46,560
Just give them a place to play where 
there's a nurse available.

1818
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:51,561
If someone gets hurt,
there is an adult but he's not 

1819
01:22:51,561 --> 01:22:51,561
supervising.
He's just over there,

1820
01:22:51,561 --> 01:22:53,130
right?
So don't worry parents,

1821
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:56,190
there is an adult but beyond that can do
what they want.

1822
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:59,790
And they just started this a few weeks 
ago and the results are fantastic.

1823
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:03,300
The kids were having so much fun.
They are becoming more independent,

1824
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:05,710
they're more willing to do projects on 
their own.

1825
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,450
It's working out great.
So,

1826
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:08,360
oh,
that's really good,

1827
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:11,800
do this on your own,
but the thing is we all know something's

1828
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:13,600
wrong.
So those are very practical,

1829
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:16,510
very practical piece of advice for,
for schools.

1830
01:23:16,511 --> 01:23:20,580
It's like open up the unsupervised play 
facilities and,

1831
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:22,870
and,
and facilitate their use.

1832
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:23,800
That's right.
Give,

1833
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:25,900
give everyone a place which is safe.
And by safe,

1834
01:23:25,901 --> 01:23:27,330
I mean physically safe,
right?

1835
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:31,300
Never use the word safety to describe 
emotions and ideas.

1836
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:36,390
Safety means physical safety.
So you've got to provide a physically 

1837
01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:37,810
safe place for the kids to play.
And beyond that you let them go.

1838
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:40,060
Now there will arise.
Problems of bullying.

1839
01:23:40,061 --> 01:23:43,100
So if it's repeated harassment or you 
know,

1840
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:44,740
well,
I know a book about God,

1841
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:49,830
which by down always called bullying,
what we know and what we can do about 

1842
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:49,830
it.

1843
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:54,360
And it was written,
it's got to be 30 years ago and always 

1844
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:54,360
cut the real,
the,

1845
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:54,580
the,
the,

1846
01:23:54,581 --> 01:23:55,630
uh,
the,

1847
01:23:55,900 --> 01:24:00,900
the incidents of bullying in the 
Scandinavian countries down by 50 

1848
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:01,300
percent.
And he really,

1849
01:24:01,301 --> 01:24:06,301
really targets what bullying means.
So he's not a safe space guy by any 

1850
01:24:06,301 --> 01:24:07,270
stretch of the imagination.
Um,

1851
01:24:07,271 --> 01:24:12,271
I don't know what the origins of it are.
I know that evaluations of his program 

1852
01:24:12,271 --> 01:24:16,021
in America show it anywhere from zero to
20 percent reductions in much smaller in

1853
01:24:16,511 --> 01:24:17,290
the u.
s in the U.

1854
01:24:17,291 --> 01:24:19,630
s yeah.
The question is whether or not they were

1855
01:24:19,631 --> 01:24:22,240
able to implement them with the rigor he
did in the U.

1856
01:24:22,241 --> 01:24:23,120
S.
yeah.

1857
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:28,300
But bullying programs are part of the 
problem because bullying clearly is a 

1858
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:28,300
problem.
We need to do something about it,

1859
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:30,340
but because we have what's called 
concept creep.

1860
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:31,630
Yeah.
So,

1861
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:33,850
so it's not a bad concept.

1862
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:35,080
Creep looks like even.
Yeah,

1863
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:36,670
that's right.
Uh,

1864
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:41,290
so now it's the case that if,
if kids don't invite,

1865
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:44,680
if some kids want to do something and 
they don't invite another kid,

1866
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:46,100
they've excluded that kid.
Right.

1867
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:47,500
Well that could be bullied.
Right.

1868
01:24:47,501 --> 01:24:52,501
I've read of schools in Europe that 
don't allow kids to have best friends 

1869
01:24:52,501 --> 01:24:52,930
for exactly that reason.
Yeah.

1870
01:24:52,931 --> 01:24:57,931
Well,
because this is also something that 

1871
01:24:57,931 --> 01:25:00,121
really bothers me about the misuse of 
the iat because it's not that easy to 

1872
01:25:00,121 --> 01:25:02,560
distinguish in group preference,
which no one can.

1873
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:07,800
No one went in their right mind.
Would want to eliminate in group 

1874
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,471
preference,
given that it governs your choice of 

1875
01:25:10,471 --> 01:25:10,960
mate and your behavior towards your 
family members,

1876
01:25:10,961 --> 01:25:12,030
let's say,
to,

1877
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:14,620
to distinguish that between outgroup 
exclusion.

1878
01:25:14,621 --> 01:25:19,621
There's no,
no simple matter and to tell kids that 

1879
01:25:19,621 --> 01:25:22,771
they can't have a best friend is another
thing that interferes with an important 

1880
01:25:22,771 --> 01:25:22,771
part of their.

1881
01:25:22,771 --> 01:25:22,771
That's right.
Yeah.

1882
01:25:22,771 --> 01:25:26,150
I think both of us have spent a lot of 
time looking at ancient wisdom at,

1883
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:27,770
at the writings of,
of,

1884
01:25:27,870 --> 01:25:29,950
of people long ago.
Uh,

1885
01:25:29,951 --> 01:25:34,951
and I,
I often come back to aristotle's claim 

1886
01:25:34,951 --> 01:25:35,500
that any virtue carried to extremes 
becomes advice.

1887
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:41,130
So inclusion is a good thing if people 
are being excluded because they have a 

1888
01:25:41,130 --> 01:25:45,331
physical stigma or,
or they're overweight or their skin 

1889
01:25:45,331 --> 01:25:49,561
color.
So we need to be looking at the reasons 

1890
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:53,041
why kids are excluded.
But if you say inclusion is the primary 

1891
01:25:53,041 --> 01:25:55,480
virtue,
inclusion over everything else.

1892
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,450
And so if those two best friends are 
excluding others,

1893
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:00,640
know more best friend,
this is madness.

1894
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:04,430
This is a vice.
So I think that again,

1895
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:09,550
you know,
it's a virtue unless it's carried to 

1896
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:09,550
extremes.

1897
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:14,250
Well,
that's probably a pretty good place to 

1898
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:14,250
stop,
I would say,

1899
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:14,250
unless you.
Have,

1900
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:15,100
you have anything else that you wanted 
to talk about?

1901
01:26:15,101 --> 01:26:18,280
We were,
we talked about the role of religion and

1902
01:26:18,281 --> 01:26:20,590
in the fact that people are naturally 
religious thinkers.

1903
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:25,120
We talked about the Heterodox Academy.
We talked about your work on disgust and

1904
01:26:25,121 --> 01:26:27,610
your plans for the academy.
You talked about your books.

1905
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:32,020
Is there anything else that that might 
be of interest that you can think of?

1906
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:34,420
Um,
just that,

1907
01:26:34,630 --> 01:26:39,630
uh,
I'll just say that I'm actually 

1908
01:26:39,630 --> 01:26:41,080
optimistic about what's going to happen 
on campus.

1909
01:26:41,081 --> 01:26:44,230
I think things might continue to get 
worse this year.

1910
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:49,920
Um,
but I think there's an interesting 

1911
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,501
phenomena called preference 
falsification when you have people not 

1912
01:26:53,021 --> 01:26:57,280
speaking honestly,
as you had under communism,

1913
01:26:58,150 --> 01:27:03,150
when you have a whole system where 
almost everybody thinks this is 

1914
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:03,150
terrible.
I hate this,

1915
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:05,440
but I don't dare say anything.
When you have preference,

1916
01:27:05,441 --> 01:27:07,300
falsification is to work by team or 
Koran.

1917
01:27:07,810 --> 01:27:12,810
Um,
and everybody hears everybody else's 

1918
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:12,810
preferences.
So they think,

1919
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:12,810
okay,
that's what everybody thinks.

1920
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:15,940
When you have an unraveling,
it can unravel very quickly.

1921
01:27:16,330 --> 01:27:21,330
And that's what happened in the 
communist countries because everybody 

1922
01:27:21,330 --> 01:27:23,440
hated it and it felt amazingly quickly.
And I think the,

1923
01:27:23,441 --> 01:27:23,870
you know,
the,

1924
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:27,520
the pushback at read last week or there 
was written up last week.

1925
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:32,760
So I think because most people,
and we're starting to see is that a lot 

1926
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:34,890
of people of color also is that,
you know,

1927
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:36,160
you're not speaking for me.

1928
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:41,160
I mean every group is diverse.
And so when you have a variety of people

1929
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:44,290
and you have progressive speaking,
when you have a variety of people,

1930
01:27:44,710 --> 01:27:45,520
um,
I,

1931
01:27:45,670 --> 01:27:48,310
I think we're going to see more and more
people standing up saying,

1932
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:50,530
wait,
what's happening is this is not right.

1933
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:55,830
This is illiberal.
This is opposed to the values of the 

1934
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:55,830
academy.
This is not what I want for myself or my

1935
01:27:55,830 --> 01:28:00,091
kids or my students.
So I do think that we're going to start 

1936
01:28:00,091 --> 01:28:01,220
seeing a lot more people standing up.
Um,

1937
01:28:01,330 --> 01:28:06,330
and one of our goals of heterodox 
academy is to just help put out the 

1938
01:28:06,330 --> 01:28:09,451
ideas that people need.
And this is what you're doing to just 

1939
01:28:09,451 --> 01:28:09,451
put out the ideas,
critique the bad ideas,

1940
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:14,550
and put out concepts in that that can 
contest in this space of ideas and get 

1941
01:28:17,861 --> 01:28:20,740
good information.
So if people go to Heterodoxacademy.org

1942
01:28:20,741 --> 01:28:22,900
on our research pages,
we have all the information that,

1943
01:28:22,901 --> 01:28:25,110
what all the polls say.
What's the current information about,

1944
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:27,910
about students attitudes?
We have the history of this.

1945
01:28:27,911 --> 01:28:30,250
We have a lot of research on who is more
biased,

1946
01:28:30,251 --> 01:28:30,910
left or right.
Well,

1947
01:28:30,911 --> 01:28:32,800
turns out both sides are about equally 
biased.

1948
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:38,500
So we think that by just doing what we 
actually do well as academics,

1949
01:28:38,501 --> 01:28:42,580
that is research making arguments,
being common,

1950
01:28:42,581 --> 01:28:43,940
civil,
um,

1951
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:46,000
we actually think that we can turn this 
around.

1952
01:28:46,150 --> 01:28:48,070
So if anybody watching this as a 
professor,

1953
01:28:48,071 --> 01:28:51,250
I would invite you to join.
Go to Heterodoxacademy Dot Org,

1954
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:52,230
uh,
and science.

1955
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:52,790
Okay.
So,

1956
01:28:52,791 --> 01:28:55,020
so let me ask you one more question.
I mean,

1957
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,770
I'm,
that,

1958
01:28:55,800 --> 01:29:00,800
that sounds good and I'm,
it's good to hear that you're 

1959
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:00,900
optimistic.
I mean,

1960
01:29:00,901 --> 01:29:01,790
I,
I waiver,

1961
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:05,170
although I wouldn't say I'm pessimistic,
I,

1962
01:29:05,171 --> 01:29:10,171
I just think we're in one of those 
situations where things could spiral in 

1963
01:29:10,171 --> 01:29:10,860
either direction very rapidly and that 
worries me.

1964
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:16,310
What about the disciplines on campus 
that seemed to be primarily devoted to 

1965
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:19,800
the activist cause?
Like because my view is,

1966
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:24,630
or my fear is that we've subsidized the 
activist disciplines,

1967
01:29:24,631 --> 01:29:26,460
let's say women's studies as a good 
example,

1968
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:30,270
but we could say social work and then 
the faculties of education now as well.

1969
01:29:30,271 --> 01:29:33,270
I think they're in the same,
in the same bin.

1970
01:29:33,271 --> 01:29:33,900
Let's,
let's,

1971
01:29:33,930 --> 01:29:38,930
let's put it that way.
That women's studies programs in 

1972
01:29:38,930 --> 01:29:42,141
particular,
their express goal expressed on their 

1973
01:29:42,141 --> 01:29:46,101
websites is to produce social justice.
Radical left leaning activists.

1974
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:51,560
And so like for awhile,
one of the things I proposed in Canada 

1975
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:55,221
was that the conservatives in particular
cut the university funding by 25 percent

1976
01:29:56,161 --> 01:29:58,290
so that the universities would have to 
sort themselves out.

1977
01:29:58,710 --> 01:30:01,770
But then that was,
that was a provocative claim obviously.

1978
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:06,771
But then I thought,
well that's not a good idea because it 

1979
01:30:06,771 --> 01:30:09,231
opens up the door to political 
interference in the academy and that's 

1980
01:30:09,231 --> 01:30:09,570
bad.
That's left.

1981
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:10,150
No,
that's right.

1982
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:15,220
That's right.
But the academy has done a very bad job 

1983
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:16,320
of policing itself methodologically and 
we have these disciplines.

1984
01:30:16,350 --> 01:30:21,350
Women's studies I think is a prime 
example and that's been very much 

1985
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:22,200
criticized in Canada by Janice Flamenco 
who used to be.

1986
01:30:22,201 --> 01:30:23,160
Yeah.
Yeah,

1987
01:30:23,161 --> 01:30:24,360
she is.
And she's,

1988
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,420
she,
she's not an unnatural mill.

1989
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:28,200
You when she's doing such things,
you know,

1990
01:30:28,201 --> 01:30:30,780
she's,
she's a brave and tough person and she's

1991
01:30:30,781 --> 01:30:34,800
gone after the women's studies types on 
methodological grounds particularly.

1992
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:40,130
But,
but there are people who are working 

1993
01:30:40,130 --> 01:30:42,320
full time at doing nothing but producing
the kind of polar.

1994
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:44,490
So what do you have any thoughts about?
Yes,

1995
01:30:44,491 --> 01:30:45,420
I do.
I think

1996
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:47,090
so.
I'm here.

1997
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:52,120
I teach in business school here and I 
teach a course called professional 

1998
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:54,320
responsibility and I teach my students 
about their fiduciary duties,

1999
01:30:54,870 --> 01:30:57,710
their duties to their employers,
the duties that we have to each other.

2000
01:30:58,770 --> 01:31:02,090
And fiduciary duty refers to a very,
very high standard of care.

2001
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:04,260
If you're managing someone's money,
you know,

2002
01:31:04,270 --> 01:31:06,230
you,
you really have to be committed to doing

2003
01:31:06,231 --> 01:31:08,180
what's in their interest,
not in your interest.

2004
01:31:08,810 --> 01:31:10,610
And I think we need that concept in the 
academy.

2005
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:16,030
We have a mature project,
we call it fiduciary duties or just 

2006
01:31:16,030 --> 01:31:19,240
professional duties,
but I think we have two primary 

2007
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,870
professional duties that we must never,
never be tray one,

2008
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:24,620
the most important one in our role as 
scholars is our duty to the truth.

2009
01:31:25,130 --> 01:31:30,130
We must never say things that we think 
are false or allow people to stay,

2010
01:31:30,291 --> 01:31:33,560
things that we think are false because 
we're afraid if we challenge them,

2011
01:31:33,561 --> 01:31:34,340
we'll get in trouble.

2012
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:37,880
So we have a fiduciary duty to the truth
and political,

2013
01:31:37,881 --> 01:31:41,930
ideological commitments clearly warp us,
they make us do things,

2014
01:31:41,931 --> 01:31:42,920
they make us,
they push us.

2015
01:31:43,850 --> 01:31:45,770
Um,
so we've got a whole.

2016
01:31:46,050 --> 01:31:49,220
We've got to recognize that if we let 
our systems get out of whack,

2017
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,560
we are betraying the truth.
Were systemically,

2018
01:31:51,850 --> 01:31:53,480
or do you want to.
If we ever went systemic,

2019
01:31:53,481 --> 01:31:58,481
truth isn't problem.
We are systemically betraying the truth 

2020
01:31:58,481 --> 01:32:01,031
in many of our disciplines.
So I think we need an awareness of that 

2021
01:32:01,031 --> 01:32:04,020
and we need to hold ourselves to a 
higher standard than in our role as 

2022
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:04,020
teachers.
We have an here,

2023
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:07,720
we really can call it a fiduciary duty.
These are people's children who are sent

2024
01:32:07,721 --> 01:32:11,680
to us to educate,
to enlarge their minds,

2025
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:16,740
to teach them skills.
If we were to use them for our sexual 

2026
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:18,880
pleasure,
it's obviously a horrific crime,

2027
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:22,270
but what is it if we use them for 
ideological purposes,

2028
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:24,910
if we say you've given me your children 
to educate,

2029
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:26,620
I'm waging a political battle.

2030
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,830
I'm going to try to get your statements,
tools,

2031
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:30,490
ms.tools.
That is horrific.

2032
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:33,550
That is unacceptable.
We are violating our duties.

2033
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:35,800
So I think,
right.

2034
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:40,860
But the response to that,
especially from the postmodernist types 

2035
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:43,330
is that that's all the ribs.
There's only ideologic yeah.

2036
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:46,300
Perfect.
So back to your original question,

2037
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:47,830
um,
are there problem departments?

2038
01:32:47,890 --> 01:32:52,890
Absolutely.
So I want it to put forth these two 

2039
01:32:52,890 --> 01:32:55,501
commitments to truth and to educating 
not indoctrinating and universities that

2040
01:32:56,651 --> 01:33:01,651
embrace these highest goals like the 
University of Chicago I think is the 

2041
01:33:01,651 --> 01:33:04,921
best candidate will probably find that 
they need to do something about 

2042
01:33:07,211 --> 01:33:08,770
department that don't live up to those 
goals,

2043
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:15,060
other universities.
And I think Brown is leading the way on 

2044
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:15,880
this one so far.
I mean the early in 2015,

2045
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:21,030
the president had all kinds of 
statements about brown is committed to 

2046
01:33:21,030 --> 01:33:23,581
social justice,
a fundamental bedrock commitment to 

2047
01:33:23,581 --> 01:33:23,581
social justice.

2048
01:33:23,581 --> 01:33:26,470
She said so if some universities choose 
to devote themselves to social justice,

2049
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,050
that's fine.
Just be up front about it.

2050
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:32,230
Say So.
So students will know if you want social

2051
01:33:32,231 --> 01:33:33,520
justice training,
you go to Brown.

2052
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:36,880
But if you want to actually be trained 
to find the truth to do research,

2053
01:33:36,881 --> 01:33:41,881
you go to Chicago and I think we're 
going to see people flooding to Chicago 

2054
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:45,180
and schools like it.
So what I'm hoping what I'm hoping.

2055
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:47,140
So that's the mechanism there.
If they,

2056
01:33:47,141 --> 01:33:52,141
if they make,
if they make their statements public 

2057
01:33:52,141 --> 01:33:55,050
that the choice of the students will be 
to go to the universities that hold the 

2058
01:33:55,050 --> 01:33:56,340
principles that you just described over 
the other one.

2059
01:33:56,341 --> 01:33:58,090
So it'll be a marketplace choice.
Exactly.

2060
01:33:58,210 --> 01:33:59,560
That's right.
So that's why I said when I talked about

2061
01:33:59,561 --> 01:34:01,720
the emperor's new clothes,
we have a situation,

2062
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:06,960
we have a gigantic market failure in 
which our top universities are offering 

2063
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:09,430
a product that most consumers don't 
want.

2064
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:15,780
And so my prediction is that Chicago is 
going to see a huge surge of 

2065
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:17,290
applications this year.
And if that's true,

2066
01:34:17,650 --> 01:34:19,510
um,
I think other universities are going,

2067
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:23,650
they're going to take notice.
So I'm hoping that we'll see a schism in

2068
01:34:23,651 --> 01:34:27,550
the American academy between those 
universities that stand up and say,

2069
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:32,610
this is madness.
We are committed to providing a 

2070
01:34:32,610 --> 01:34:32,610
platform.
We don't discriminate based on viewpoint

2071
01:34:32,610 --> 01:34:34,420
and politics.
That's the Chicago way.

2072
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:39,720
And those that say no whereabouts social
justice come here and we will train you 

2073
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:40,240
to fight for social justice and against 
the right.

2074
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:43,690
So if,
if people have clear choices,

2075
01:34:43,990 --> 01:34:46,810
then I think we're gonna see a big 
change.

2076
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:48,790
And that's why I'm optimistic.
I think we're going to see that.

2077
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:52,360
Alright,
well thank you very much.

2078
01:34:52,450 --> 01:34:53,620
It was great talking with you.
