1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,153
Hi everyone,
so I'm making an announcement today and 

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,003
I suppose you might regard it as an 
advertisement so I'm warning you to 

3
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:15,480
begin with because I don't want you to 
waste your time if you're not interested

4
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:19,230
in listening to a description of the 
newest thing that we've created.

5
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:20,064
So we just put up a website called 
understand myself.com and it's a 

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,913
personality assessment for individuals 
and it's based on a personality model 

7
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:31,254
that was developed in my lab about 10 
years ago by Dr Colin De Young and a 

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,633
Lien Dr Lena quilty.
Dr Young is now a professor at the 

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,810
University of Minnesota and it was based
on some ideas that I had been developing

10
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:49,470
with another former student of mine,
Dr Daniel Higgins,

11
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:53,640
who's a partner with me in this 
enterprise along with my former graduate

12
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:56,520
supervisor,
Dr Robert Peel from Mcgill University.

13
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,110
It's based on the big five personality 
model which measures extroversion,

14
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:02,803
which is a positive emotion dimension on
is associated with gregariousness and 

15
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:10,200
enthusiasm and assertiveness and 
sociability and that sort of thing.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,340
And,
uh,

17
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,270
a trait called neuroticism,
which is basically negative emotionality

18
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,530
which is associated with a proclivity 
towards anxiety and emotional pain,

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,610
agreeableness,
which is compassion and politeness.

20
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:26,040
And so agreeable people are,
I would say,

21
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,890
broadly speaking,
rather maternal and their orientation,

22
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:31,320
they tend to care more for others than 
for themselves.

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,300
They're more cooperative than 
competitive,

24
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,134
whereas so-called disagreeable people 
are more competitive and more Bruce Guy 

25
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:39,534
would say,
and perhaps more straightforward and 

26
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,190
more able to stand up for themselves as 
well.

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,593
Conscientiousness is another one of the 
dimensions that's orderliness and 

28
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,374
industriousness.
And the last dimension is openness to 

29
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:53,094
experience,
which is a combination of interest and 

30
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:59,220
ideas which is often known as intellect 
and a interest in aesthetics,

31
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:01,290
um,
and which is associated,

32
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:02,124
let's say with creativity.
And that's the dimension that's also 

33
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:04,764
most highly correlated with Iq.
We developed the big five aspect scale 

34
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:10,440
in an attempt to take the big five.

35
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,330
So that's extroversion,
neuroticism,

36
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:13,164
agreeableness,
conscientiousness and openness to 

37
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:18,120
experience which are the canonical 
dimensions of personality.

38
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,193
We developed the big five aspects scale 
in order to break down those big five 

39
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,663
traits,
each of them into their two most 

40
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:26,304
statistically robust subcomponents and 
we call those aspects and that's 

41
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:32,790
actually become a pretty popular 
personality model.

42
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:33,624
The scientific paper which announced 
that a statistical division has accrued 

43
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,903
about 750 citations,
which is an awful lot of citations by 

44
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:43,920
the way,
for a scientific paper.

45
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:46,270
It makes it into a kind of classic,
um,

46
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,273
especially because it's only also only 
had 10 years to accrue citations and 

47
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:51,923
citation is when some other scientists a
refers to the paper in one of their 

48
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:55,890
papers,
by the way.

49
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,173
Anyways.
I've been working over the last couple 

50
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,153
of years to generate really detailed 
personality reports on each of the big 

51
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,144
five traits and the 10 aspects at about 
seven different levels of specificity 

52
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,140
ranging from extremely low to extremely 
high.

53
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,333
And we think we've produced what might 
be the most comprehensive and accurate 

54
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:19,090
personality reports that are currently 
available.

55
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,990
You answer 100 questions in order to 
complete the personality survey.

56
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,410
The questions themselves are actually 
public access,

57
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:27,244
or you could call them open source.
They were derived from Lou Goldberg's 

58
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:32,050
Ip,
Ip,

59
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:35,710
international personality item,
pool there the consequences of many,

60
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:40,711
many decades of attempts to define a set
of phrases that most comprehensively and

61
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,624
also most concisely captures the 
variation in human personality and so 

62
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:50,230
you can find those questions many places
on the line,

63
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,064
but the reports themselves and the 
comparison sample of approximately 

64
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:54,484
10,000 people are proprietary and 
constitute the essential element of 

65
00:03:58,331 --> 00:03:59,164
value in in our offering.
Essentially what we're hoping is that 

66
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,034
people can use this personality test 
site to develop a much deeper 

67
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:09,430
understanding of themselves so that they
know what their light,

68
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,323
especially compared to others and that 
they can also compare themselves to 

69
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,200
anyone else.

70
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,100
For example,
who might have taken the test and see.

71
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,203
The thing about personality is that the 
differences between people actually run 

72
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:25,270
quite deep.
There's a lot of individual variability,

73
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:28,330
so there are people who are extremely 
extroverted and they want to spend every

74
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:29,164
moment of their time socializing with 
other people and there are people who 

75
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:32,554
are very introverted and they want to 
work alone and they find interactions 

76
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:37,114
with.
With large groups of people or even 

77
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:39,184
small group,
sometimes quite tiring and they have to 

78
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:44,320
spend a lot of time recovering.
They tend to be much more quiet,

79
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,783
not necessarily shy because that shyness
is more a consequence of variation on 

80
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:50,314
the second dimension,
neuroticism and so people are high in 

81
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,620
neuroticism.
Our field,

82
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:54,454
much more anxiety and emotional pain per
unit of uncertainty and stress than 

83
00:04:58,451 --> 00:04:59,284
people who are very low in neuroticism,
who are often known as emotionally 

84
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,540
stable and who tend to be quite 
imperturbability.

85
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,210
Agreeable people,
as I mentioned before,

86
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:08,044
are warm and compassionate and and very 
much care for other people but are also 

87
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:14,980
likely to be taken advantage of and to 
feel a certain amount of resentment.

88
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:15,814
Whereas disagreeable people are tough 
and straightforward and competitive and 

89
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,623
out for victory,
but can also be somewhat self centered 

90
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:26,040
and harsh and then conscientious.
People are hardworking and beautiful.

91
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,170
Conscientiousness is a really good 
predictor of longterm life success,

92
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:30,004
especially in academic attainment where 
it's second only to icu and also in 

93
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:34,594
managerial and administrative jobs that 
require attention to detail and a fair 

94
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:40,750
bit of responsibility,
let's say,

95
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:43,870
and routine work,
openness to experience.

96
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:47,530
That's the creativity dimension and some
people are extremely high in openness to

97
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:48,364
experience and they want to do nothing 
but discuss ideas and and spend their 

98
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:52,414
time in creative and artistic pursuits 
and other people are more conservative 

99
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:56,284
because low openness is with 
conservatism and they're not really 

100
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:04,370
interested novel ideas and they don't 
think abstractly that often and they're.

101
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,263
They're not out for new experiences or 
flights of fantasy or imaginative 

102
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:09,074
exercises or any of that thing.
There are a lot more concrete and 

103
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:11,930
practical.
Now.

104
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:12,764
The reports that we've prepared not only
provide you with information about all 

105
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:17,174
of the aforementioned big five traits,
they also break each one down into its 

106
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,310
dual aspects.
So there's actually 15 different sources

107
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:30,110
of information that are contained in the
reports and so for extroversion,

108
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,160
you get a description of the degree to 
which you are assertive,

109
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,110
which means forthcoming,
let's say,

110
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:40,850
in public and and willing to put your 
opinions forward and enthusiasm,

111
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:45,380
which is a more pure marker of positive 
emotion and the capacity to look forward

112
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:49,280
to and enjoy events and situations 
spontaneously.

113
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,100
And with neuroticism.
You learn about the trait aspects,

114
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,730
withdrawal and volatility and withdrawal
is the tendency to be stymied or,

115
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,380
or stopped,
let's say,

116
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,590
by fear to be frozen in some sense like 
a prey animal.

117
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:11,270
And volatility is an aspect that's 
associated with irritability.

118
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,290
And the tendency to,
uh,

119
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,410
be easily rubbed the wrong way,
let's say.

120
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:18,710
And to react emotionally to that.
And then for agreeableness,

121
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:21,020
there's two aspects and one is 
compassion,

122
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:21,854
which means pretty much what it says,
it's the ability to embody the feelings 

123
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:29,630
of others and to react in a caring 
manner to that and politeness,

124
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:33,950
which seems to be something like respect
for authority and social conventions.

125
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:35,990
And so one of the things you see,
for example,

126
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:36,824
is that liberals are higher in 
compassion and conservatives are higher 

127
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:39,824
and politeness,
even though they're both aspects of 

128
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,793
trait.
Agreeableness conscientiousness breaks 

129
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:47,240
down into two aspects as well,
which are quite interesting.

130
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,810
One of them is industriousness,
which is associated with diligent,

131
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:51,644
hard work and the ability to stay task 
focused without distraction and to work 

132
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:56,774
hard and orderliness,
which seems to be associated with 

133
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:00,284
disgust sensitivity and which is a 
pretty good predictor of conservative 

134
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,363
belief.

135
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,203
Uh,
as it turns out that some elements of 

136
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:07,214
conservative belief are associated with 
higher than normal levels of or higher 

137
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:11,570
than average,
let's say,

138
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,493
levels of disgust sensitivity.
And the final trait division into 

139
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:19,190
aspects is that of openness to 
experience.

140
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:21,710
And it can be divided into openness 
proper,

141
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,000
which is essentially a dimension of 
creativity and aesthetic sensitivity.

142
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:30,140
So preference for engagement in 
activities that are associated,

143
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:33,920
say with fiction or drama or art and 
intellect,

144
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:34,754
which is an index of interest in ideas 
and abstraction and philosophical 

145
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:39,224
concepts and that sort of thing.
So the report produces a very high 

146
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:47,150
resolution representation of personality
and they're very interesting differences

147
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,840
at the aspect level that are worth 
concentrating on.

148
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,823
We try to develop a personality test 
that isn't designed to make you feel 

149
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:54,164
good about yourself,
although it might know it depends on 

150
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:56,754
your personality,
but to give you the most accurate and 

151
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,073
straightforward description of who you 
are that's possible so that you can use 

152
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,970
the genuine information that's provided 
in order to maybe organize your life.

153
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,293
Also understand the difference between 
yourself and other people because you 

154
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:13,014
know we often think that the reason that
we don't share the same viewpoint is 

155
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:16,494
because we have differences of opinion,
but it actually goes a lot deeper than 

156
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:20,304
that because you're very.
Perceptions are dependent on the 

157
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:23,334
variability in your personality and so 
it isn't only that people differ in 

158
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:27,354
their opinions.
They differ very much in how they see 

159
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:30,930
the world,
how they actually perceive the world.

160
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:35,931
Because your personality constitutes a 
kind of template or filter through which

161
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,380
you organize your perceptions.
And so it's very important to understand

162
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:44,700
that there is substantial personality 
variability in the world and that you're

163
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:48,000
often talking with people who see things
differently than you.

164
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:51,900
And a good example of that is the divide
between,

165
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,853
let's say left leaning people in,
right leading people because the left 

166
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:56,004
leaning,
people tend to be very high in openness 

167
00:09:57,271 --> 00:10:00,480
to experience and relatively low in 
conscientiousness,

168
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:02,910
especially in the aspect of orderliness.

169
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,570
Whereas the conservative types tend to 
be very high in conscientiousness,

170
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:09,870
especially orderliness and relatively 
low in openness.

171
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,290
And so those are fundamentally different
orientations in the world.

172
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,870
And you could say that the more 
conservative types,

173
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:16,704
that more right wing types are much more
concerned with the preservation of 

174
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,680
tradition and tend to believe that 
things that have been done,

175
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,090
the tried and true manner in the past 
are the most reliable.

176
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,253
Whereas the people who are on the left 
who are more radical or more concerned 

177
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:31,914
with the fact that the environment 
shifts radically and rapidly and 

178
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:37,710
unpredictably and so we have to be 
willing to shift with it.

179
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:38,544
And so those are both valid viewpoints 
because every element of lived 

180
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:45,600
experience has an orderly element and a 
chaotic element,

181
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:48,090
let's say,
and you have to be prepared for both.

182
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:48,924
And the purpose of straightforward 
political dialogue between people of 

183
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:53,034
different personality types is to help 
determine on an ongoing basis how much 

184
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:57,234
we should be relying on tradition and 
how much we should be attempting to 

185
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,870
transform ourselves.

186
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,703
And there is no permanent solution to 
that problem because things stay the 

187
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:08,400
same and change and they do that at 
different rates at different times.

188
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,234
So dialogue is unbelievably important.
Which by the way is why I'm such an 

189
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:13,764
advocate,
let's say for free speech because it's 

190
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,074
the mechanism that keeps people up,
different types speaking instead of 

191
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:20,610
fighting.
So it's really important.

192
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:21,444
So anyways,
the website is called understand 

193
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:28,290
myself.com and you can go there and sign
up for the personality test.

194
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,124
It'll be delivered to you pretty much 
immediately after you fill out the 

195
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:32,670
questions.
They.

196
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:33,504
Each question is posed as a phrase,
I'm take you about 15 minutes to 

197
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,280
complete the questions.
You can only do it once.

198
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:44,910
And the reason for that is that the 
norms that we compare you against,

199
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:45,744
so that would be the self reports of the
10,000 other people against whom you're 

200
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:49,560
compared.

201
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,393
They were only allowed to do at once.
And so we have to maintain stringent 

202
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,690
control over that to maintain that 
validity of the test.

203
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,851
And,
uh,

204
00:11:56,851 --> 00:11:58,720
I would say don't do it when you're 
hungry.

205
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,243
Don't do it when you're tired,
don't do it when you're feeling down or 

206
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:03,664
in a bad mood about yourself or feeling 
self critical and don't do it when 

207
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:08,590
you're likely to be interrupted or 
distracted.

208
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,830
You want to take it seriously and you 
want to think about your answers.

209
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:16,000
Now you're supposed to answer as you are
typically not as you'd like to be.

210
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,290
Um,
and you know,

211
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,620
you don't want to be either too hard on 
yourself or too good to yourself.

212
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,573
You want to be as accurate as possible 
because then you'll benefit most from 

213
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:24,724
the feedback.
And then the last thing I would say is 

214
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:30,820
that we've,
some of you know about this already,

215
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:35,350
but we've also developed a set of 
interventions called self authoring.

216
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,880
And that's available at [inaudible] dot 
com and what self authoring can help you

217
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:40,714
do is reconfigure certain elements of 
your behavior and perhaps over the long 

218
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:45,694
run your personality.
So the cell phone suite helps you write 

219
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:52,120
an autobiography and detail out the,
uh,

220
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,193
both positive and negative experiences 
of your past so that you can capitalize 

221
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:57,034
on the positive experiences and figure 
out how to duplicate them and maybe put 

222
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:00,454
the negative experiences to rest and we 
feel that that's a good way to reduce 

223
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,103
trait neuroticism over the long run.
And the evidence for that is that 

224
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:08,554
writing programs of this sort tend to 
improve people's mental health and 

225
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,580
decrease their negative emotion so and,
and stabilize them.

226
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:16,414
So.
So if you take the personality test and 

227
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:19,900
you're not happy,
for example,

228
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:20,734
with your scores on trait neuroticism,
you feel that you would benefit from 

229
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,030
some additional emotional stability.

230
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,133
Then the past authoring program from the
self authoring suite might be something 

231
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:30,814
worth considering.
And then with regards to the other 

232
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:34,264
personality traits,
I'm the present authoring program at 

233
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,290
[inaudible] dot com is also a 
personality exercise of a sort.

234
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,124
But what it helps you do is center on 
your virtues and your false using a big 

235
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:47,674
five model again so that you can 
identify what's good about your 

236
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:50,644
personality and figuring out how to 
capitalize that on that in the future 

237
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,303
and so that you can identify where your 
major weaknesses are and figure out how 

238
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,294
to rectify those.
And so that's useful for general 

239
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:01,504
personality work I would say.
And then the last one which we've done 

240
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:07,030
the most research on is called future 
authoring.

241
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,583
And the future authoring program helps 
you think about your life and we think 

242
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,544
about it as an adjunct to 
conscientiousness perhaps over the long 

243
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:20,551
run and also as an exercise that could 
increase positive and decreased negative

244
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:21,604
emotion by by helping you establish your
goals and also stabilizing your view of 

245
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:26,410
the world.

246
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,130
So in the future authoring program,
you're asked to consider your life along

247
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,040
about seven dimensions.
So friendship,

248
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,413
intimate relationships,
what you do outside of work with your 

249
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:38,044
private life in terms of useful and 
creative activity or enjoyable activity 

250
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:45,400
or social activity.
What you're aiming for in your career,

251
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,370
how you're going to configure your self 
education.

252
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,830
How you're going to take care of 
yourself mentally and physically and how

253
00:14:51,831 --> 00:14:52,664
are you going to handle your use of 
drugs and alcohol because those are 

254
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:55,904
pitfalls that people often encounter 
that that tear them down and hurt them 

255
00:14:59,121 --> 00:14:59,954
badly,
and so you're asked to think about 

256
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:02,294
yourself three to five years down the 
road as if you were taking care of 

257
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,280
yourself as if you were a valuable 
person.

258
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,070
You know,
because you want to extend that courtesy

259
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:14,540
to yourself because you're as valuable 
on average as anyone else and you should

260
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:15,590
treat yourself that way.

261
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,080
So anyways,
you're asked to design a future three to

262
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:18,914
five years down the road where your 
experience along each of those 

263
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:23,864
dimensions is optimized.
And then you're asked to write for 15 

264
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:30,770
minutes about what your life could be 
like three to five years down the road.

265
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,873
If you were taking care of yourself the 
way you should and things were working 

266
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:35,564
out properly.
So you could imagine that you're 

267
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:39,110
developing a vision of the life that 
you'd like to lead.

268
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,100
And then you're asked to reverse that 
and to write for 15 minutes.

269
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:43,934
And think about this as well.
About what your life would be like if 

270
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,810
you let your bad habits and your 
character,

271
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:48,644
logical weaknesses,
take the upper hand and Auger you into 

272
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:53,030
the ground so that you became,
you know,

273
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:56,660
a failure and bitter and resentful and 
isolated and unhappy and,

274
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,700
and all of the terrible things that go 
along with bad luck and,

275
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,260
and also a missed opportunities.

276
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,093
And let's call them ethical errors.
So and then you're asked to take your 

277
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:07,874
positive vision for the future and 
elaborate that out into a detailed plan 

278
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,050
where you justify your,
your goals,

279
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:17,300
you,
you describe what those goals are.

280
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:22,070
You rank order them in importance.
You describe how you would be better and

281
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:22,904
your family would be better and your 
society would be better if you stuck to 

282
00:16:25,371 --> 00:16:26,204
your goals.
You make a contract with yourself to 

283
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,380
determine how it is that you were going 
to approach those goals and stay on path

284
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,543
and and so forth.
And so these are quite extensive 

285
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:40,070
exercises and we develop them,
you might say,

286
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:40,904
as an alternative to lengthy and 
expensive psychotherapy and there's a 

287
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:46,424
fair bit of research evidence suggesting
that writing exercises of this sort are 

288
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:50,354
extremely effective ways of 
reconfiguring the manner in which you 

289
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:55,670
approach the world.
And so the research we've done,

290
00:16:55,671 --> 00:16:56,504
for example,
in three different locations now and 

291
00:16:58,221 --> 00:17:01,070
with with several thousand college 
students,

292
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:03,800
although this is not a program only 
designed for college students,

293
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,873
has indicated that even if you do a 
relatively poor job of let's say the 

294
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:10,790
future authoring program and you're a 
college student,

295
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:11,624
it increases the probability that you'll
stay in your program by about 25 

296
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:15,434
percent,
which is a walloping improvement and 

297
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:19,940
also has about the same effect on your 
grade point average.

298
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,780
And so that seems to be particularly 
true for people who are doing the worst.

299
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,643
So it's been really effective for 
disenchanted ethnic minority males in 

300
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:31,340
Holland,
for example,

301
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,174
compared to the Dutch national females 
who do better than anyone else in the 

302
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:36,824
sample that we looked at two years after
the entire group did the future 

303
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:42,104
authoring program.
The ethnic minority males who are 

304
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:45,584
underperforming by about 80 percent 
caught up and slightly exceeded the 

305
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:49,214
performance of the Dutch national women.
So that was absolutely staggering 

306
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:53,214
results as far as we're concerned.
We also duplicated that at a place in 

307
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:56,874
Canada called Mohawk College,
showing that the program worked 

308
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:00,204
particularly effectively for men again,
for males who are underperforming 

309
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:04,074
females generally speaking in the 
academic world and especially if they 

310
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,410
were males who hadn't done that well in 
high school and hadn't carved out a very

311
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:14,280
specified a route forward in their 
academic achievement.

312
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,890
So it's an excellent way of getting your
act together.

313
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:17,724
And so anyways,
the understand myself.com page is 

314
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:22,194
designed to give you a picture of your 
personality in detail and then the self 

315
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:25,914
authoring program is designed to help 
you reconfigure the way that you 

316
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:31,560
approach life.
And so we're hoping that the combination

317
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:32,394
of those two things are particularly 
effective way of bringing high quality 

318
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:36,983
psychological information and advice and
help to a very broad audience at a very 

319
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:45,030
low cost and at a relative minimum of 
demands on time.

320
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,163
Um,
I would say we do know with the self 

321
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:49,260
authoring program that the more you 
write,

322
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,094
the better it works,
which is sort of tantamount to saying 

323
00:18:51,781 --> 00:18:54,480
that the program works better in your 
life,

324
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:56,610
gets better,
the more you think about the future,

325
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:57,444
which really stands to reason,
but it's nice to see that actually 

326
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,290
represented and duplicated as part of a 
scientific research project.

327
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,123
So anyways,
we've tried to keep the programs as 

328
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:09,810
reliable as possible,
as straightforward as possible,

329
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,883
as dependent on your own actions as 
possible because the writing is really 

330
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:15,384
crucial to reconfiguring your 
personality and as widely distributable 

331
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:21,480
and as low cost as we can possibly 
manage.

332
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,523
We're trying to provide you with 
accurate psychological information so 

333
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,124
that you understand yourself and other 
people better and so that your life can 

334
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:32,970
be configured in a manner that I hope is
much more beneficial to you personally,

335
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,833
personally and helpful to your family 
and also has a positive effect on the 

336
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:38,394
broader society around you.
Because that's a great triumvirate of 

337
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,250
attainment and it's exactly what you 
should be aiming for.

338
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:49,251
So I would say I encourage you to 
determine who you are and to think about

339
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:53,130
that very carefully and then to 
determine very carefully who you want to

340
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:56,220
be and why and to make a plan.

341
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,960
You know you don't get the opportunity 
to do that in school,

342
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,600
junior high,
high school,

343
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:01,830
College,
university,

344
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:02,843
no one ever sits you down and helps you 
figure out where you came from and who 

345
00:20:06,061 --> 00:20:08,520
you are and what you're doing and you 
really need to know that.

346
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,940
I should also say that with the 
understand myself dotcom site,

347
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:12,774
we're also working on our couples module
that will enable the people who have 

348
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:17,484
filled out the report to ask someone 
else to also do the questionnaire and 

349
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:21,954
then they'll both get a report that 
details out there similarities and 

350
00:20:24,211 --> 00:20:25,044
differences so that they can come to 
understand where they're going to be an 

351
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:28,644
agreement and get along and share 
interests and where they're likely to 

352
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:32,820
have conflict and what might be done 
about that.

353
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:36,720
And I would say that's at minimum a 
month to two months away.

354
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:37,883
And we're also going to release a high 
school version of the self authoring 

355
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:40,770
suite.

356
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:44,670
So that people can start to plan their 
lives when they're much younger and will

357
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:48,100
only ask the high school students to 
think about three to months out into the

358
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:48,934
future because when you're that young,
that's about the practical limit of 

359
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:53,314
your,
I wouldn't say ability to think forward 

360
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:56,770
into the future,
but the younger you are,

361
00:20:56,771 --> 00:20:59,200
the shorter your time horizon,
partly because,

362
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,333
well,
you haven't been exposed to the world 

363
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:03,850
that much and there's,
you still have plenty to learn.

364
00:21:03,851 --> 00:21:04,720
So,
but anyways,

365
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,554
we have a high school version in the 
works and so all announced that when it 

366
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:08,494
comes out.
And so we all hope that you find these 

367
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:11,800
offerings,
uh,

368
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,310
useful and practical and uh,
um,

369
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,983
and that they help you put your life 
together so that you can be a solid 

370
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:24,220
citizen and a responsible person and as 
emotionally stable as possible and maybe

371
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:26,890
even find some happiness along the way 
from time to time.

372
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:28,150
So that would be really good.
