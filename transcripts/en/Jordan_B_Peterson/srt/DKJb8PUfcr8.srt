1
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,490
We're going to collabs lecture eight and
nine together

2
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,520
since there's no class on the 27th.
Bsa is now due on the third of April,

3
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,530
the next day.
So just after reading.

4
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,263
Okay.

5
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,220
I suppose for the next essays,
although once again you're

6
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,860
obliged to pick your own topic,
some use,

7
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,893
some reliance on the secondary meetings 
would probably be useful because one of 

8
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:21,814
the things that concerns me is that 
people aren't going to do the secondary 

9
00:01:24,311 --> 00:01:25,144
reading since we don't talk much about 
the in class since I don't make it a 

10
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,530
point of pestering you with exams or 
such.

11
00:01:32,531 --> 00:01:35,260
Regarding the secondary readings,
they are important.

12
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,550
Um,
did I want to ask you,

13
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,150
did I go over in this class the purpose 
of each of the readings?

14
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,220
No.
Okay.

15
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,100
I did that my other class.
I'll do that now.

16
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,340
Do you want to tell you why I wanted you
to read what I outlined?

17
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:54,883
Well,
the purpose of the neuropsychological 

18
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,510
papers that does everybody have their 
syllabus.

19
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,123
Okay,
good.

20
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,233
The purpose of the neuropsychological 
papers is pretty much obvious to get to 

21
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:06,034
give you some additional material 
bearing on neuro psychology to sort of 

22
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,050
flesh out the additional discussion.
Okay.

23
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,980
Newman's book,
the origins and History of consciousness

24
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,040
provides the best overview that I know
of here on mythology.

25
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:23,883
The most accurate overview.
It's a book that's much like Joseph 

26
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,060
Campbell's hero with a thousand faces,
except I think it's the.

27
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,580
See the problem with Joseph Campbell is 
that he's too optimistic he'll.

28
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,953
For Campbell,
the hero's journey is something that's 

29
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:43,480
always positive and I don't think that's
true.

30
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,520
I think it's more.
Well,

31
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,363
I mean the standard hero myth in Western
culture is Christ's passion that 

32
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:56,530
involves
exposure to a hostile group,

33
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,050
torture and then dad.
So

34
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,093
that aspect of the hero myth at least 
could not be construed as particularly 

35
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:08,740
positive.
So anyways,

36
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:09,574
I,
I think that new ones work is for 

37
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:15,100
original
and the great mother.

38
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,700
While the reason that I want you to read
the great mother is because.

39
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,623
Let me read you something from ham here.
First would be a good introduction to 

40
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:25,414
this.
I like this quote because a Donald Hebb 

41
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,050
is extraordinarily well regarded by 
physiological psychologist.

42
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,123
He was the person who originated the 
hypothesis that I'm of neural networks 

43
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:43,990
basically and um,

44
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,140
suggested that learning occurred as a 
consequence of potentiation,

45
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:52,410
of the communication between neurons.
Anyways,

46
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,790
head states,
even in ourselves.

47
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,823
Civilized,
amiable and admirable parts of mankind 

48
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,080
well brought up and not constantly in a 
state of fear.

49
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,453
There are signs that this or that,
it depends as much on our successfully 

50
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:09,144
avoiding disturbing stimulation as on a 
lower sensitivity has already suggested 

51
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,750
the capacity for emotional breakdown,
maybe self concealing leaving the animal

52
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:24,240
to find or create an environment in 
which the stimuli to excessive emotional

53
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:29,241
responses are at a minimum.
So effective is our society in disregard

54
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,043
that it's members,
especially the well to do and educated 

55
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:37,080
ones may not even guess at some of their
own potential realities.

56
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,363
One usually thinks an education in the 
broad sense that's producing a 

57
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,193
resourceful emotionally stable adult 
without respect to the environment in 

58
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:48,060
which these traits are to appear.
To some extent,

59
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:48,894
this may be true,
but education can be seen as being also 

60
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:52,254
the means of establishing a protective 
social environment in which emotion 

61
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,520
instability as possible.

62
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,080
Perhaps it strengthens the individual 
against unreasonable fears and rages,

63
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,573
but it's certainly produces the 
uniformity of appearance and behavior 

64
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:06,814
which reduces the frequency with which 
the individual member of the society 

65
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,790
encounter such causes a disturbance on 
this via the susceptibility to emotional

66
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:15,664
disturbance may not be decreased.
It may in fact be increased the 

67
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:21,910
protective cocoon of uniformity in 
personal appearance.

68
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,230
Manners and social activity generally 
will make small deviations from customer

69
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:29,740
care increasingly
strange,

70
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,620
exhausted.
The general thesis is sound increasingly

71
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:33,454
intolerable.
The inevitable small deviations from 

72
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:36,544
customers will bolt increasingly large 
and the members of the society finding 

73
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:42,520
themselves tolerating trivial deviations
well.

74
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,410
We'll continue to think of themselves as
socially adapted with that.

75
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,160
The last sentence there,
I mean when he says it a little,

76
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,143
because first it is to read that this 
even the slightest difference will be 

77
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:56,434
noticed as large,
but then you're saying that that we're 

78
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,110
bearing that there will be born well.

79
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,180
Does that mean that the biggest society 
does.

80
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:06,803
He just means that maybe I'll be able to
tolerate you if your hair is an inch 

81
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:13,070
longer than mine,
and if I can do that,

82
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,620
I will think I'm taller,
but if it's three inches longer,

83
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:17,000
well,
I said look out.

84
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,583
So what he's basically saying is the 
range within which the definition of 

85
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:25,730
tolerance exists will become 
increasingly restricted.

86
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,790
So
nonetheless,

87
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,860
society will continue to think of itself
as Tom.

88
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,870
Absolutely right.
Absolutely.

89
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:36,740
So now what does that have to do with 
the great mother,

90
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:40,040
which was of course the question that I 
addressed the quote to,

91
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:42,170
well,
if have this right,

92
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,890
and other people have made very similar 
suggestions,

93
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,300
including you who said that?
This is quite hilarious.

94
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:53,474
I think he said what is ordinarily 
called religion is a substitute to such 

95
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:57,584
an amazing degree that I asked myself 
seriously when did this kind of 

96
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:01,690
religion,
which I prefer to call a creed,

97
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,713
may not after all,
have an important function in human 

98
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,024
society.

99
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,513
The substitute has the obvious purpose 
of replacing immediate experienced by a 

100
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:12,440
choice of suitable symbols,
tricked out with an organized dogma,

101
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,450
and Rachel,
the Catholic Church,

102
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:16,370
maintains the by her indisputable 
authority,

103
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,533
the Protestant church,
if this term is still applicable by 

104
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,890
insistence on belief and the evangelical
message,

105
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,960
so long as these principles work,
people are effectively protected against

106
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:31,500
the media who they just experience.
The notion being that the purpose of dog

107
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,750
culture is protect people from religious
experience now might think,

108
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:39,554
well,
why does it have to do with him 

109
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,670
statement?
Well,

110
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,123
the essence of religious experience 
might be regarded as as overwhelming 

111
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,383
emotional experience,
and what young is saying is that the 

112
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:51,314
purpose of Dogma
is to protect you from encounter with 

113
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:56,843
the most fundamental emotions and have 
points out that culture may protect you 

114
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:02,714
so well.
Then you have no idea what it is that 

115
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:04,814
you're being protected from.
The general thesis of this course is 

116
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,240
that the thing that you are protected 
from,

117
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,074
it's so terrible that you'll do anything
to maintain the protection even though 

118
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:20,090
under most circumstances you won't even 
know that it's there.

119
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,233
The reason I want you to read the great 
mothers because it contains a 

120
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:27,074
description of symbols that have been 
accumulated in innumerable societies 

121
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:31,604
over thousands of years that have been 
created in an attempt to portray the 

122
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:40,430
nature of what is so terrible that you 
cannot tolerate it,

123
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,043
and to the degree that art works,
this symbolic representations of the 

124
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:51,690
unknown are effective because most of 
those I would say,

125
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,120
fact that what our does,
you know,

126
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:56,160
if you think,
think about it this way,

127
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,103
that the purpose of culture isn't as 
similar to Oregon and that's one way of 

128
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:01,194
looking at it and the processes that 
exist around the perimeters of the 

129
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,430
Oregon,
so to speak.

130
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:07,440
Think of it as an island.
It's always expanding.

131
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,663
The processes that work in the middle of
the island aren't the same processes 

132
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,800
that work on the edges,
the clothes that you are to the middle,

133
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:14,460
so to speak.

134
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,293
The more things are absolutely defined 
which which is to say that you can 

135
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:18,924
explain them in words.
They very predictable and been given a 

136
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:22,380
rational,
rational underpinnings.

137
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,590
They're explicitly discussable there 
semantically formulated,

138
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,663
but around the edges,
x word peculiar activities still takes 

139
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:30,054
place.
That would be the initial stages of the 

140
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:34,530
assimilation process and that's where 
fantasy plays a big,

141
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,603
big role because fantasy is the place 
where the unknown first transforms 

142
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:39,864
itself into the unknown and while you 
could say that people's use of symbols 

143
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,080
and that sort of thing,
you know,

144
00:09:45,081 --> 00:09:48,480
artistic productions are their attempt 
to make up the unknown.

145
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:50,050
Something provisionally.
No,

146
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,580
I mean I think that's what art is doing.
It's always working as it,

147
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,970
as the little cow where new information 
is being fed.

148
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,760
New cultural information is being fed 
into the culture.

149
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,260
That's its purpose.

150
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,630
And there's a book by

151
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,150
no,
there was an address by social units and

152
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,060
the Nobel prize winning addressed,
I think it's called beauty will save the

153
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:14,460
world,
which is a dusty esky quote.

154
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,150
And this is an argument that social 
media makes that link of purpose of,

155
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,910
um,
of higher order culture,

156
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,953
the humanities and the arts on to open a
window into those domains that still 

157
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:29,610
exist as unknown.
And to let some new information in,

158
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,900
you would say,
well,

159
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,360
artistic religious symbols of that sort 
function to do that.

160
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,580
Over time they performed their function.
Then they lose their vitality.

161
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,380
So you can't tell what they mean 
anymore.

162
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,243
They don't.
They don't intrinsically attract your 

163
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:47,700
attention anymore.
Forget what they mean.

164
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,063
The reason I want you to read the great 
mother and to look at the in there so 

165
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:55,530
that
with any luck,

166
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,503
what the people who made those 
representations were trying to 

167
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:04,791
communicate will retain.
It's significant so that you can see the

168
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:09,890
nature of the terror that religious dog,
one culture in general,

169
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:13,640
which gives everything a uniform 
appearance of irregularity.

170
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,993
Why?
That was what that was all directed to 

171
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:21,570
protect us against.
So now it's the purpose of that whole.

172
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,640
And I think if you read it,
it will do it.

173
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,460
What's the title of Associate Address?

174
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,770
Beauty will save the world.
I have the essay in a collection

175
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,200
than I can.
I can show you.

176
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,140
Even if you look at,
look at it this way.

177
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,840
Okay,
so you walk into a museum.

178
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:43,150
Mrs Happened to me on a number of 
locations.

179
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,793
There's all paintings everywhere and 
some of them have no emotional 

180
00:11:48,071 --> 00:11:49,420
significance at all.
You know,

181
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,890
you might try to
generate some sort artificially,

182
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,160
but a lot of them just don't capture you
now.

183
00:11:57,161 --> 00:11:59,080
And then if you're lucky,
if you're in a good museum,

184
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,190
I suppose whether you know something or 
not also makes a difference,

185
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:08,191
but you'll come across a payday or a 
statue that will grab you and the reason

186
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:09,310
that grabs you,
I think.

187
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,990
So.
It's a visual portrayal.

188
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,400
Um,
then go.

189
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,603
That's a good example of sunflowers.
What van Gogh managers to do is to 

190
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,520
present you something that's familiar or
that you think is familiar,

191
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:29,590
which means something that you've 
habituated to,

192
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,200
which means something that you think you
understand,

193
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:38,310
but he twists it so that the phenomena 
now retains that.

194
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,813
The novelty that perhaps it once had 
when you first encountered the thing or 

195
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:45,394
in the primeval state,
I suppose would be a symbolic way of 

196
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:49,900
looking at it.
So what the artist's forces you to do,

197
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:50,734
at least momentarily,
it's to snap out of the or habituated 

198
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,553
complacency and to view the object 
that's being represented as something 

199
00:12:57,551 --> 00:13:02,551
that has not yet lost its sheen of arts 
pristine.

200
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,583
It's pristine aspect,
so then you can see what's actually 

201
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,980
there instead of looking at your own 
memory,

202
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,053
which is what you almost always do when 
you look at something and you have very 

203
00:13:17,491 --> 00:13:21,300
limited attentional capacity and almost 
everything that you encountered,

204
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,990
you see as a representation of that 
thing.

205
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,390
Everything that you've explored before,
that's how your brain,

206
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:30,690
in a sense makes the most use out of its
limited capacity.

207
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,340
You always watch your own memory and a 
great artist is someone who can snap you

208
00:13:35,341 --> 00:13:36,174
out of that momentarily to make you see 
what's actually there and theoretically 

209
00:13:39,571 --> 00:13:40,404
that can give you some insight,
some additional insight into the nature 

210
00:13:42,811 --> 00:13:43,644
of the world.
And art in that sense still has a 

211
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:46,734
religious function in their arch.
Originally only had a religious 

212
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:51,960
function.
It's only had a nonreligious function in

213
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:55,800
the west for maybe 400 years.
So

214
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:02,490
for the bulk of human history,
art played an explicitly and that's what

215
00:14:02,731 --> 00:14:03,450
it's trying to do.

216
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:08,450
It's the place where information
is first manifest,

217
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,930
first manifests itself before it becomes
something that's concrete and

218
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,270
candidate.
So anyways,

219
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:19,710
hopefully if you look at the great 
mother,

220
00:14:19,711 --> 00:14:20,544
you'll be able to see these 
constructions with the same eyes that 

221
00:14:25,591 --> 00:14:28,950
the people who originally made them and 
you can tell if that happens because

222
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,493
the objects will stop looking like 
foreign cultural artifacts and start 

223
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:38,070
looking like representations of 
something.

224
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,743
And it's really.
I think you can really see a shift in 

225
00:14:42,301 --> 00:14:43,380
perception if,
if,

226
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,440
if if you,
if you were doing the right thing,

227
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,000
what you want to try to do is to occupy 
the territory,

228
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,033
the person who originally constructed 
the representation to see what it was 

229
00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:57,740
that they were trying to portray.
A lot of these figures,

230
00:14:57,741 --> 00:14:58,880
they took a lot of work.
You know,

231
00:14:58,881 --> 00:14:59,714
you have to be highly motivated to spend
hours or weeks or even years 

232
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:04,184
constructing a representation of 
something that you don't really 

233
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:06,854
understand.

234
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,670
You have to put yourself in the position
of those people and see what it was,

235
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,743
what worked it,
and think about what it must have been 

236
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,983
that grip them so hard to motivate them 
to produce something that has so little 

237
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:22,640
apparent economic value and yet it takes
so much effort,

238
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,600
so it's very.
It's very worthwhile to do that.

239
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,980
The use and abuse of history.
That's the next leg.

240
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,913
It's a very small book.
The reason that I want you to read that 

241
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:37,000
is because it's the only book that I 
know of.

242
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:41,690
It clearly describes the pathological 
aspect of culture,

243
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,590
not the pathological aspect of any 
particular culture,

244
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,790
but the fact of the culture as a 
phenomenon necessarily.

245
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:54,791
How's it pathological impact or 
pathological aspect that's inevitable.

246
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:01,350
He basically points out that
history is a burden as well as,

247
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:04,910
uh,
as well as a great advantage.

248
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:09,560
And to put it simplistically,
I suppose what you might think of is the

249
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:13,640
fact that if you're going to be a 
classical musician,

250
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,503
for example,
the fact that innumerable classical 

251
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:17,084
musicians have lived before you is a 
tremendous opportunity because you have 

252
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:26,510
the opportunity to master the skills 
they developed and transmitted,

253
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,853
but by the same token,
it's also an incredible impediment to 

254
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:36,890
your own progress because your domain of
competition has become so broad,

255
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,113
you know it only compete for preeminence
and recognition in the present with all 

256
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:44,660
the other people who are trying to 
become classical musicians,

257
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,943
but you necessarily pit yourself against
those people who were the absolute best 

258
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:53,450
at that for as long as that particular 
activity is being recorded.

259
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,703
So as a consequence,
you're necessarily trivialized in 

260
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,460
relationship to the,
to these heroic figure something

261
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,970
the past.
So neat.

262
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,833
You have also added to that by saying 
that the great composers of the past 

263
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:14,070
have also limited the president composer
by making the eyes of of everyone around

264
00:17:15,011 --> 00:17:16,660
them used to the,
to the,

265
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,523
to the,
to the kinds of stuff that previous one 

266
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,950
time at created would expect that.

267
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,890
Yes,
yes.

268
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:26,890
Certainly whenever I think like I can,
I think you can see minor indications of

269
00:17:27,401 --> 00:17:30,700
this on an ongoing basis in our own 
culture.

270
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,820
Like I think one of the things that 
mass,

271
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,270
the mass reproduction of music for 
example,

272
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:38,104
has done because this also.
This also occurs with televised events 

273
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,440
because the television is even more 
accurate.

274
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,274
What television does is make history of 
an event as it curves and the fact that 

275
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,873
you get the historical perspective on 
things as they're instantaneously 

276
00:17:57,271 --> 00:18:02,271
occurring I think is very hard on your 
own perception of the utility of meaning

277
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:06,120
of your own life.
It strikes me that increasingly we're in

278
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:06,954
the position of not presuming that 
anything is real unless we see it on 

279
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:14,481
television and that people have devalued
their own personal culture and I mean by

280
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:15,564
that they're individual culture and 
their familial culture in favor of this 

281
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:22,620
global culture which which although it 
appears to be ongoing,

282
00:18:22,621 --> 00:18:25,470
is really sort of instant history.

283
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,873
So the thing about a television has,
it'll capture your attention no matter 

284
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:31,620
what.
Someone.

285
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,453
It'll capture your attention instantly,
which basically means that you're 

286
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,373
considering the thing that's being 
portrayed as more important than 

287
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:42,480
anything that you could be doing at that
present time.

288
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,090
So the how does that.
How's that?

289
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,970
Is that what you mean by history or do 
you mean something else?

290
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:50,880
By checking into history,
meaning taken away,

291
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,700
taken away what people would add to it 
or.

292
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:55,010
I mean what I understand what?
Well,

293
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,640
it's just part of the weight of the.
Like.

294
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,160
The thing about television is that it's 
the whole culture,

295
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:01,080
right in your living room.
You know what?

296
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:03,240
It's a tremendous.
It's a tremendous.

297
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,270
It competes tremendously for your 
attention.

298
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,433
I mean it offers you access 
theoretically all these cultural 

299
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:10,644
resources,
but at the same time simultaneously 

300
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,250
while you're engaged in getting access 
to these resources,

301
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,233
you're not actually living and you're 
not producing or creating anything of 

302
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:21,744
your own so that it's a good example of 
what Nietzsche is talking about when he 

303
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,520
talks about the abusive history.

304
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,653
So wait,
it gets an opportunity because it's 

305
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:30,324
information,
but at the same time it's a tremendous 

306
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:33,640
weight.
So you know,

307
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,060
you see this when you get people sitting
around.

308
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,953
This used to happen to me in graduate 
school now and then when people would 

309
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:41,064
sit around and a large chunk of their 
childhood memories that are shared 

310
00:19:44,401 --> 00:19:47,310
memories were television shows that they
had all watched.

311
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,623
And what that means is that instead of 
having individual memories about the 

312
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,683
events,
you have transpersonal memories about 

313
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:59,730
the same events that aren't even real.
I think that's another indication of how

314
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,051
it.
Yeah,

315
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:02,310
it is.
It's very peculiar.

316
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,383
Very peculiar.

317
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,393
Well,
I was thinking that this was more 

318
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:09,070
trivial,
but I was thinking the time

319
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,620
that this has only happened over a span 
of 40 years.

320
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:17,970
Say Rock music is only 40 years old,
but as there was more and more of it,

321
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:23,090
the likelihood that I'm stations like 
these,

322
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,933
all these golden oldies stations popped 
up in the eighties and they played like 

323
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,830
the music of the sixties and the 
seventies.

324
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:29,963
And what happens is there's a limited 
bandwidth of radio and the historical 

325
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:34,584
productions occupy a broader and broader
section of the bandwidth until the new 

326
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,020
bands,
so to speak,

327
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,380
are not only competing against all the 
other bands who were now,

328
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,333
but all the other bands that have 
accumulated over this 40 year period 

329
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,170
when nature,
he talks about the weight of history,

330
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:53,260
the accumulated weight of history.
Well that's a trivial example as I said,

331
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:53,780
but that's.

332
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,890
It's still something that's happened 
over the span of four years.

333
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,323
So it's a burden.
So it's a very short essay that I 

334
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:04,930
thought was the best answer I've ever 
encountered on that particular topic.

335
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,300
So nature,
you see the reason I like that,

336
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:10,410
it's because they need to.
Being an extraordinary burner.

337
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:15,430
Genius was always cognizant of the fact 
that you don't get this,

338
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,090
which is like the protective aspect of 
the great father.

339
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,730
That's the thing that renders everything
predictable,

340
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,710
intolerable.
You don't get that.

341
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:24,544
Then you can get it without also getting
this is that the wise king and the 

342
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,200
tyrants are inseparable and there can be
some movement back and forth from one to

343
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:34,060
the other.
I mean,

344
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,893
it does seem upon occasion all of 
culture can turn into something 

345
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:39,334
tyrannical,
but Nancy was pointing out that even in 

346
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:42,814
its most positive guys is the fact that 
there is culture constitutes an 

347
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:47,704
impediment to your own success as well 
as one of the preconditions of your 

348
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:56,470
success.
You get kind of warped views of that.

349
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,740
This is mostly interesting for those of 
you who

350
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,970
are interested in clinical psychology or
psychopathology.

351
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:05,763
The humanistic branch of psychology 
basically took this argument but only 

352
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,290
half of it and he said,
well,

353
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,990
because one of their questions was 
where?

354
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,780
Where does human evil come from?
Where human suffering,

355
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:21,781
I suppose it Carl Rogers and Abraham 
maslow and probably the foremost

356
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,183
exemplars of humanistic psychology.
They basically made the presupposition 

357
00:22:31,221 --> 00:22:32,054
that this is their story.
The individuals intrinsically good and 

358
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,440
if you just provide the proper 
preconditions,

359
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,274
then everything will turn out positively
to the degree that the individual isn't 

360
00:22:44,271 --> 00:22:46,520
good.
It's because society,

361
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,460
which is then cast complicity in the 
negative role,

362
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:53,930
distorts the possibilities of the 
individual as he or she matures.

363
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,900
Well,
that's a good story and it's true.

364
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,913
I mean,
it's obviously the case that as you 

365
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:03,380
mature all sorts of arbitrary 
limitations and be placed on you,

366
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,610
really arbitrary limitations,
many of which have crushed and distorted

367
00:23:07,611 --> 00:23:12,611
and work your your character in some 
matters that might even be unalterable,

368
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,953
but by the same token,
this is also true is that you are an 

369
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,980
behave nasty little brood when you were 
little and it was the positive aspect of

370
00:23:26,701 --> 00:23:27,534
culture in force on your behavior that 
made you even vaguely socially 

371
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:32,724
acceptable.
Now the humanists tend to tell one side 

372
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,630
of the story.
This is the thing.

373
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,570
This is another reason why I really like
this,

374
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,880
this diagram because it's a pretty 
simplistic diagram,

375
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,193
but the fact that it's a complete story 
is very useful and if you know the 

376
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:49,580
complete story,
you know that,

377
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,571
well,
yes,

378
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:51,404
there's negative aspects of culture,
but they're in separately tied to the 

379
00:23:54,711 --> 00:23:55,544
positive aspects and yes,
there are negative aspects of nature or 

380
00:23:58,911 --> 00:23:59,744
the unknown,
but there are also positive aspects and 

381
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:05,510
likewise for the individual than it.
If you know that,

382
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,373
if you understand what it means,
then it can stop you from falling sort 

383
00:24:08,721 --> 00:24:09,554
of whole heartedly into what I think are
relatively one sided simplistic 

384
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:16,190
ideologies.
Because if someone says,

385
00:24:16,191 --> 00:24:17,024
well,
you know,

386
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,900
all human evil is attributable to the 
faults of society.

387
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,130
You can say,
well,

388
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:23,730
yes,
but you know,

389
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,770
here are all sorts of counterexamples to
that particular claim.

390
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,840
Or if people say,
well,

391
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,940
because this is a common 
environmentalist claim,

392
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,893
sort of.

393
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,383
This is kind of funny.
I had another friend in graduate school 

394
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:43,481
who was a German great big guy.
I mean he was a German ancestry and uh,

395
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,350
he,
he was really a nice fellow.

396
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,020
Which meant that in your contact with 
him,

397
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:56,021
you never observed any overt aggression.
And uh,

398
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:02,530
he told me once he was a left sort of,
he had your typical left leaning liberal

399
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:06,140
philosophy,
the ideology.

400
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,753
He was environmentally concerned and he 
was anti big business and so on and so 

401
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,950
forth,
which is all perfectly reasonable.

402
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,833
But he told me once the planet would be 
better off if there were no people on 

403
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:19,004
it,
meaning that human beings intrude onto 

404
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,750
nature and destroy things and that it 
would be better.

405
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,880
But then I thought,
well that's an interesting example,

406
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,500
the collective unconscious,
I suppose,

407
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:31,603
because
the notion that the notion that the 

408
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:39,190
planet would be better off without 
people in it presumes that

409
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,630
nature is something that's all 
beneficial.

410
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,720
The pristine and unspoiled nature is all
positive,

411
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,793
so he is dominated by the archetype is 
dominated by this architect is thinking 

412
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,713
unconsciously.
He thought nature was a French 

413
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,160
impressionist landscape.
But then he said,

414
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,293
well,
the planet would be better off without 

415
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:00,704
people on it.
Which meant that if he was given his 

416
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,830
free rein of expression,
he would immediately become an exponent.

417
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,160
This part of the great mother and do his
best to,

418
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,270
to decimate everything that he could lay
his hands on.

419
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,880
Yes,
the people than I thought.

420
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,260
I thought it was interesting and in part
given his German cultural ancestry,

421
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,113
because the idea that the planet would 
be better off without people on it was 

422
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:27,150
certainly something that motivated the 
Nazis.

423
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,840
For example,
so whenever you hear anybody say that,

424
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,180
I mean,
he,

425
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,200
he was no problem because he was in 
graduate school,

426
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,303
graduate students at most.
He could recap all according to his 

427
00:26:36,621 --> 00:26:38,480
girlfriend and maybe a few friends,
you know,

428
00:26:38,481 --> 00:26:41,050
if you really went into all out.
But uh,

429
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,063
anyways,

430
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,610
I don't understand what the frame of 
references is that I'm negative.

431
00:26:48,611 --> 00:26:49,444
Positive,
positive to the individual or is it two 

432
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,480
areas are just innately negative or 
positive?

433
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,310
I don't understand.

434
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:58,070
Is the emotional.
I guess it's the emotional

435
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,853
valence of the different domains.
All I'm saying there is that any 

436
00:27:05,301 --> 00:27:06,134
phenomena has the capacity to produce 
both positive and negative emotions 

437
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,160
depending on the context and 
interpretation,

438
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:13,483
sort of an implicit part of it.
I guess it would be in reference to the 

439
00:27:16,311 --> 00:27:17,450
individual.
Okay.

440
00:27:17,451 --> 00:27:19,490
So presumes a subject.

441
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,450
So the negative,
the negative aspect.

442
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:28,730
So the great mother on this side where 
the individual is positive,

443
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,700
um,
is,

444
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,870
is,
is seen by the individual is negative.

445
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:33,580
Oh,
well.

446
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,413
Oh,
I see what you're saying there is the 

447
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:41,210
positive aspect of culture protects you 
from the negative aspect of Don.

448
00:27:41,211 --> 00:27:42,700
No.
Okay.

449
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,380
And here it's that the negative aspect 
of culture,

450
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,930
uh,
for bids,

451
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:51,540
your contact with the positive aspect of
the unknown,

452
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,180
which was your point,
say with regard to the composers,

453
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,550
there are ways that you should conduct 
yourself,

454
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:57,384
which means here's a whole set up 
alternative possibilities which you're 

455
00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:04,680
forbidden to explore and that's useful 
because you won't become afraid,

456
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:09,681
but it's constricting is restricted to 
your potential domain of activity.

457
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,630
And I would say here,
well,

458
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:13,763
the reason these two are matched is 
because it's the negative aspect of the 

459
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:19,824
individual that we'll see later that 
heightens the likelihood that culture 

460
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:26,730
will take on a negative or tyrannical 
last time.

461
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,120
So I would say for example,
let's take a look at the Nazis.

462
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,250
Now,
one of the things that Nazis were trying

463
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:35,310
to do,
they have a tight ideology and they were

464
00:28:35,311 --> 00:28:36,144
trying to produce a domain that was very
secure and they were sacrificing people 

465
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:44,880
all the time to construct this 
particular domain.

466
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,820
So,
and I would say that,

467
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:52,650
well,
there's two reasons possibly to,

468
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,920
to
persecute other people.

469
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:02,370
One is because they're in your way and 
you're trying to construct a do a domain

470
00:29:02,921 --> 00:29:06,280
that's secure,
so if you're an explorer,

471
00:29:06,281 --> 00:29:07,114
for example,
when you come across another tribe of 

472
00:29:10,121 --> 00:29:12,880
people who don't speak your language,
while as far as you're concerned,

473
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:16,630
they're barbarians and your job is to 
establish your territory,

474
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,273
but then the other reason for first 
accusing other people is because you 

475
00:29:21,851 --> 00:29:22,684
enjoy it because there's something 
pathological about you and I would say 

476
00:29:26,111 --> 00:29:30,430
that the cultural movement,
which is to establish new territory

477
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:37,140
tends to become aligned with individual 
pathology and when that happens,

478
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:44,250
then you get increased likelihood that 
when territory is being established that

479
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:47,110
people will be persecuted.

480
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,330
So people like the Nazis would say,
well,

481
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:52,720
this is necessary because we want to 
establish the third.

482
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:53,554
Right?
Which is our particular brand of utopia 

483
00:29:54,911 --> 00:29:56,680
on earth.
That's their.

484
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,693
That's their justification that they 
wear like a uniform so that when they 

485
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:02,660
look at themselves in the mirror and 
they can tolerate it,

486
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:07,840
but really what's going on is that they 
really liked to hurt people and they can

487
00:30:07,841 --> 00:30:11,620
use the cultural movement,
which is part of the hero's journey.

488
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:14,740
In a sense to mask that even to 
themselves.

489
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,633
So can you,
can you look at each circle that has 

490
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,150
some kind of fortress I guess,
or a castle and yeah,

491
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,210
this is a counselor

492
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,223
negatives.
When you partner likes a track and this 

493
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,833
and unlikes whatever repel.
So I mean the positive doesn't let in 

494
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:31,544
the negative.
Negative doesn't end with a positive 

495
00:30:32,201 --> 00:30:35,140
with positive lead in the positive and 
negative 11.

496
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,143
I think that's a reasonable way of 
looking at this could easily be 

497
00:30:38,341 --> 00:30:42,770
conceptualized as a castle wall here in 
particular with would that out,

498
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,733
you know,
this domain being outside the 

499
00:30:45,991 --> 00:30:48,450
individual's surrounded by the culture.
That's,

500
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,940
which is what I was saying with regards 
to the great mothers.

501
00:30:50,941 --> 00:30:51,774
You never get to look at this even 
because you're so well protected by 

502
00:30:53,761 --> 00:30:55,140
this.
You don't even know what's there.

503
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,753
So it's like in the story of Buddha,
Buddha was brought up by his father and 

504
00:31:02,131 --> 00:31:05,490
uh,
on just before Buddhist birth,

505
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,800
a sage told his father that he will need
to grow up to be the world's savior or a

506
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:11,634
political leader.
And his father wanted him to be a 

507
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:14,874
political leader anyways.
So one of the things he did to help 

508
00:31:17,911 --> 00:31:18,744
ensure that he would stay in love with 
the world so that he occupied that 

509
00:31:23,551 --> 00:31:24,384
domain was to erect a wall around him 
and to put a paradise that means a 

510
00:31:29,731 --> 00:31:30,300
walled city.

511
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,730
By the way,
that's very interesting.

512
00:31:32,731 --> 00:31:37,170
I think to put around Buddha Gautama a 
castle wall,

513
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,183
and inside the castle there was nothing 
that was sick or old or in any way 

514
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:42,744
diseased because he didn't want to 
become conscious to essentially become 

515
00:31:46,981 --> 00:31:51,981
self conscious and to abandon the world.
So that's another good.

516
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,183
That's that story.
Has this structure explicitly like the 

517
00:31:56,131 --> 00:32:01,131
great father erects the wall around the 
individual to protect him or her against

518
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:05,130
the negative aspect of the unknown.
And that's,

519
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,563
that's.
I mean that's the subject matter for 

520
00:32:07,771 --> 00:32:11,760
today's discussion basically.
So okay,

521
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,673
so you're reading use an abusive history
because niche outlines the positive and 

522
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:17,880
the negative aspects of it.
History.

523
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,330
Sorry,
I just wanted to ask you something about

524
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,283
what you said about what your friends 
said about the world being better off 

525
00:32:24,751 --> 00:32:25,584
without people because that that seems 
to be sort of a strange and really 

526
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:29,874
meaningless projection because without 
sort of an emperor of a more sizing of 

527
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,560
the state of the world because without,
without people,

528
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:39,990
but world

529
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,823
could not be said to be better or worse 
in any way whatsoever beyond completely 

530
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:48,930
meaningless.
Yeah.

531
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,750
Yeah.
Well that's why I

532
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,480
immediately look for turtle alternative 
motive,

533
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:58,700
especially given his ancestry,
which isn't to say that there's anything

534
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,760
peculiar about journalists necessarily 
just that it's not far.

535
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:06,080
We're not far enough away from what 
happened in the Second World War for the

536
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:06,914
reasons for what happened to have 
disappeared or changed in any 

537
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:10,424
significant way whatsoever.
It's another reason why trying to work 

538
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:16,400
with this material.
In the introduction of the book,

539
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:17,234
one of the things I tried to point out 
was the fact that we don't know what to 

540
00:33:20,451 --> 00:33:21,284
remember about the Holocaust or what to 
change in our behavior as a consequence 

541
00:33:24,681 --> 00:33:25,514
of its occurrence.
It's only happened not even yesterday 

542
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,990
and we're still the same people that we 
were.

543
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,120
So when he says that the planet would be
better off without people on it,

544
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,780
then I immediately wonder,
well,

545
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:39,260
just precisely what does that mean?
Like what's your real motivation?

546
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:43,080
His motivation is something like there 
are

547
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:43,983
people are tainted intrinsically,
so badly that the only solution to the 

548
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:53,530
problem of their existence and to the 
problem they posed to nature.

549
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,420
So to speak,
that below there,

550
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:59,260
the fact that they are our nature is to 
rid the planet of the.

551
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:03,130
Now you might think that's making a lot 
out of an offhand statement,

552
00:34:03,131 --> 00:34:03,964
but the point is that people do act very
often as if they're motivated by 

553
00:34:07,571 --> 00:34:12,250
precisely that set of motivations.
So here you've got the identification of

554
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:15,550
the positive aspect of the individual 
with the positive aspect of the unknown.

555
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,743
Because if you're saying that he wants 
to destroy somebody who wants to save 

556
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:23,674
nature,

557
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,393
um,

558
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:28,331
well,
if,

559
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:29,810
what if one of these reacting against 
the,

560
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:32,200
essentially the negative aspect of the 
great father,

561
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,450
which is,
which essentially,

562
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,910
yeah,
but which is composed of all of the,

563
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,150
as you were saying about the 
identification of the negative aspect of

564
00:34:40,151 --> 00:34:42,130
it,
of the individual with the,

565
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,460
with the,
uh,

566
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,910
negative aspect of,
of the father.

567
00:34:45,911 --> 00:34:46,744
Then what then what he wants to 
eliminate as essentially the negative 

568
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:49,624
aspect of the father.
But the reason you would do that would 

569
00:34:52,331 --> 00:34:55,680
be for the sake of the,
of the positive individual and there.

570
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,900
And it seems to me that then,
then to project that on bias in terms of

571
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,690
just you're trying to save the planet,
which is nature.

572
00:35:01,691 --> 00:35:02,524
I think people seem to identify nature 
in the positive sense with the positive 

573
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,360
in.
Oh,

574
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,040
you,
so you,

575
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,970
you're,
you're making the point essentially that

576
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,040
he was confused in these mythological 
precept positions.

577
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,680
Is that.
Well,

578
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,150
um,
possibly.

579
00:35:16,151 --> 00:35:16,780
I don't know.
It just,

580
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,190
it seems to me that,
well,

581
00:35:18,191 --> 00:35:19,890
you know,
like the idea that there is some,

582
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:25,210
the God that has everything everyone has
has in them.

583
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,493
Um,

584
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,333
I mean,
it seems like if you're saying it seems 

585
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:32,124
to be strange,
strangely paradoxical to say that you 

586
00:35:33,691 --> 00:35:35,670
want to,
you want to eliminate the human race,

587
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,040
um,
for the of nature because what

588
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,960
it really seems to me that you're saying
is that you're,

589
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:43,530
you want to save what is natural and 
people.

590
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,340
I mean.
Well,

591
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,360
that's cool.
That's what I,

592
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:47,190
that's why I was wondering about 
confusion.

593
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,040
Presuppositions.
Yeah.

594
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,140
Well,
um,

595
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,493
I don't know.
I don't know where to go exactly any 

596
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:57,240
farther with that particular argument.
I mean,

597
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,733
he had.

598
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,163
Well,
I don't know what else to say about 

599
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:05,710
that.
Have you been saying.

600
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,210
I mean,
can you,

601
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:12,210
can you say that you liked nature and 
also say that you want to help the world

602
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,170
because.
Well,

603
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,280
I mean,
could you be lying in?

604
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,170
He could,
he could.

605
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,040
When he says he wants to save the world,
could you actually say,

606
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,330
I want to kill a bunch of people?

607
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:20,450
Yes,
absolutely.

608
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,820
Certainly.
Sure.

609
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,773
And then it was,
that's the best excuse for killing a 

610
00:36:24,801 --> 00:36:29,510
bunch of people.
It's the one that if you adopt,

611
00:36:29,511 --> 00:36:34,511
makes you tolerable to yourself.
So I suppose it would always be the case

612
00:36:34,701 --> 00:36:36,780
in a sense because if you're saving your
world,

613
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:39,320
if you're,
I in in terms of what we're talking,

614
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:40,683
sure,
it's,

615
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:41,903
it's a logical justification,
which perhaps upon occasion is even 

616
00:36:46,911 --> 00:36:47,744
true,
but it's also the kind of justification 

617
00:36:50,661 --> 00:36:55,661
that can easily and rapidly be twisted 
for your own particular nasty and see.

618
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:56,623
Because one of the things that's 
interesting about war is the fact that 

619
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:05,380
people will commit crimes in the course 
of work there that go beyond

620
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:15,850
the don't actually help the cause of the
war in any particular manner.

621
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:20,540
And not only that undermine necessarily 
the things that,

622
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:22,570
that person is theoretically fighting 
for.

623
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,860
Like one of the things that springs to 
my mind is,

624
00:37:24,861 --> 00:37:27,770
uh,
the plan rape of the Muslim women in,

625
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:28,663
in what used to be Yugoslavia.
And it takes that particularly the 

626
00:37:32,181 --> 00:37:37,181
justification that we are just 
establishing our own secure territory is

627
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:41,150
not sufficient to motivate the planning 
of that kind of event.

628
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,950
You need some other little bent twist to
come up with something that,

629
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:50,300
uh,
that it brilliantly cruel.

630
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:55,130
And anyways,
I'm discussing this in part as a,

631
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,653
what would you call a precursor to the 
whole last section of this particular 

632
00:37:59,781 --> 00:38:03,440
course because one of the things we're 
going to discuss in detail is the nature

633
00:38:03,441 --> 00:38:07,910
of that additional twisted motivation.
We haven't talked anything about this at

634
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:08,710
all.

635
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:12,430
Yeah.
So yeah.

636
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,383
Wait,
so I'm trying to understand what you 

637
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:20,041
just said is the only way that you can,
you can justify rape is not only to,

638
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:28,730
for the war to be a warring over land 
but also over this objective territory.

639
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,270
Well,
I would think if you,

640
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,150
if you,
if whole land women were to be raped,

641
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,250
that would.
I mean it obviously affects

642
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,773
it.
It brings down the morale of the women 

643
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:44,973
that were raped and also the community,
the community because when that 

644
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,063
happened.
So it's not really a material gain when 

645
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,180
but also an emotional.

646
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,850
Well,
I would,

647
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:55,723
I would say under most conditions it 
would be the reverse because I think 

648
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,713
like if you want to defeat someone,
I think anything you can do to them 

649
00:39:02,231 --> 00:39:07,231
that's gratuitously cruel likely only 
heightens their will to resist.

650
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,570
So I think it works as if it actually 
would work as something

651
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,270
counterproductive.
So anyways,

652
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,163
I want to leave this because we'll get 
back to this in detail later in the 

653
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:21,074
course.
This is,

654
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:21,973
like I said,
this is just sort of a preview and it 

655
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,990
says I want to get your mind thinking 
about this other.

656
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,303
Because the law,
one of the things you see we don't take 

657
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:31,790
into account,
and this is true in general psychology I

658
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:32,624
think is we have a hard time coming to 
terms with more complex base 

659
00:39:36,411 --> 00:39:38,330
motivations.
Like we don't.

660
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,223
We're not very good at conceptualizing 
things like a cleaning fee undertaken 

661
00:39:43,851 --> 00:39:45,320
for aesthetic purposes.

662
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,250
So we can't really come to grips with 
that.

663
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,560
Like even when we talk about antisocial 
personalities,

664
00:39:51,561 --> 00:39:52,880
for example,
we tend to.

665
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,060
We don't tend to think about it in terms
of some sort of.

666
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,360
All the evil is being taken out of the 
personality.

667
00:39:59,361 --> 00:40:01,730
It's something that's just a matter of,
uh,

668
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:05,870
say heightened approach systems and 
reduced response to anxiety and so on.

669
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,063
There's a whole set of complex 
motivations were not very good at like 

670
00:40:09,171 --> 00:40:12,230
the desire to kill things to hurt 
things.

671
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,810
We don't know how to deal with that or 
how they conceptualize it.

672
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,550
Anyway.
So we're going to talk about that,

673
00:40:16,551 --> 00:40:18,750
but there's also taken out of that also,
right?

674
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,440
The more complex positive,
the complex positive,

675
00:40:21,441 --> 00:40:24,350
like maybe their desire to learn from 
pushing the borders.

676
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,160
Possibly.
Yeah.

677
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:28,723
Okay.
So the structure of scientific 

678
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:31,124
revolutions,
I want you to read that because what 

679
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:35,600
killing discovered with regards to 
scientific revolutions,

680
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:37,850
I think is just just get beyond good and
evil.

681
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,070
Oh yes,
I did.

682
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,620
Okay.
Beyond good and evil,

683
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,653
I would like you to read because me and 
she wrote it after Western culture had 

684
00:40:52,371 --> 00:40:53,204
moved into an intervening period of 
chaos as a consequence of the loss of 

685
00:40:57,381 --> 00:41:02,381
its religious foundations.
And so you could say that when there's,

686
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,180
you know,
the bouncing ball diagram,

687
00:41:05,181 --> 00:41:08,240
well,
when Western culture,

688
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,470
the religious presuppositions of western
culture will were shattered.

689
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:18,080
There was an intervening period of time 
where morality as such had unspecified,

690
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,983
an unspecified reason for being a niche.
He was trying to explore the nature of 

691
00:41:24,711 --> 00:41:28,550
what used to be taken for granted,
which was the existence of the religious

692
00:41:28,551 --> 00:41:33,551
structure and the possibilities for 
reconstructing an alternative morality.

693
00:41:34,401 --> 00:41:39,401
I suppose that would be rationally,
irrationally comprehensive.

694
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,123
I guess the reason I want you to read 
beyond good and evil war particularly 

695
00:41:46,101 --> 00:41:48,740
those because reading that should do to 
you.

696
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:54,470
It's like an initiation ritual,
I guess in a sense that's intellectually

697
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:56,630
produced because nature,
he said himself,

698
00:41:56,631 --> 00:41:57,464
he philosophize with a hammer.
His point was to break down 

699
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:01,334
presuppositions.
That's what he wanted to do for a 

700
00:42:03,831 --> 00:42:07,700
defined end.
He wanted to release the will power,

701
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,680
I suppose,
or to make people aware of it.

702
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,573
And I would say what the will,
the will to power could be most 

703
00:42:12,651 --> 00:42:13,484
accurately conceptualized in terms of 
thing that allows people to continue 

704
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,230
continually erect structures of nod,
break them down and redirect them.

705
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,230
I think that's.
That's what nature striving.

706
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,850
Yeah.
I mean it's difficult to see what he was

707
00:42:25,851 --> 00:42:28,010
driving out.
So there'd be lots of debate about that.

708
00:42:28,011 --> 00:42:28,844
But beyond good and evil is,
is useful to read for a number of 

709
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:32,510
reasons.
First of all,

710
00:42:32,511 --> 00:42:34,730
you'll never find another book,
I think in your whole life.

711
00:42:34,731 --> 00:42:36,070
That's so unfair.

712
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:36,923
It's so remarkable.
Brilliant Nature said that he wanted to 

713
00:42:39,981 --> 00:42:43,160
write in a sentence what other people 
could not write in a book.

714
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:47,750
And I think that he accomplished that,
particularly with beyond good and evil.

715
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,580
Every sentence is a thought and most of 
the thoughts are brilliant and there are

716
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:57,530
many books that have one thought in them
and not even such a good thought.

717
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:01,850
So it's also pretty useful from a 
stylistic perspective because nature was

718
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:02,684
a master,
a literary master and reading him can 

719
00:43:05,271 --> 00:43:08,750
help clear up your thinking.
She's amazingly clear thinker.

720
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:12,640
So anyways,
so those are the reasons for.

721
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,050
He's also questioning,
see nature,

722
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:16,903
you said that he was the first 
philosopher who didn't set out a 

723
00:43:20,241 --> 00:43:25,241
priority to prove that a particular 
morality that already existed was true.

724
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,070
Like Nisha said,
look up to me.

725
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,233
Every western philosopher has worked 
within an established moral system and 

726
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:34,814
only attempted to justify it even though
they didn't know that's what they were 

727
00:43:37,101 --> 00:43:37,934
doing.

728
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,290
He thought that he was the first 
philosopher in history who is capable of

729
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:43,124
saying of seeing that alternative 
realities existed everywhere and that's 

730
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:50,900
the fact of morality had become a 
problem.

731
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:56,560
Why is the morality not which morality 
is right even or that are particular?

732
00:43:56,931 --> 00:44:00,530
Morality isn't necessarily right,
but why is the morality and Ken,

733
00:44:00,531 --> 00:44:01,364
they're justifiably the morality?
Is there any reason for presuming that 

734
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:05,383
the question,
what is good and what is evil is even 

735
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:11,300
worth asking or answering or has any 
reasonable answer?

736
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,493
Those are all questions he was 
attempting to address because Nietzsche 

737
00:44:14,721 --> 00:44:15,554
believed,
if you knock the god out of a religious 

738
00:44:17,271 --> 00:44:18,104
system,
which is a moral system that the entire 

739
00:44:20,031 --> 00:44:23,060
moral system,
therefore it no longer has any reason to

740
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:25,400
exist,
and if it has no reason to exist,

741
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,830
it will disappear.
Quite take hundreds of years,

742
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:29,563
but it will disappear,
and that's why he said God is dead and 

743
00:44:34,231 --> 00:44:37,590
we have killed him.
He also said to finish that phrase off,

744
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:38,424
that we will have a difficult time 
finding enough water to wash away all 

745
00:44:41,671 --> 00:44:42,504
the blood,
which was his prophecy for the 20th 

746
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:47,240
century and the part of the quote that 
many people do not,

747
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:49,830
don't realize.
Photos.

748
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:50,703
The first part,
he was attempting to address the 

749
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:55,320
problem.
If we lost our religious belief,

750
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:56,363
so now what did we do for morality?
So it's worth it's worth reading for a 

751
00:45:00,391 --> 00:45:03,300
number of reasons.
The structure of scientific revolutions,

752
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,760
Thomas Kuhn,
discovered,

753
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:10,490
don't be.
Don't mean to imply by that,

754
00:45:10,491 --> 00:45:11,324
that before when we were in western 
society had thought there was any less 

755
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,513
fortunate.

756
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,653
Yeah,
well that's a complicated question 

757
00:45:19,441 --> 00:45:24,000
because part of it's technical 
technologically technologically relate.

758
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:25,463
Yeah.

759
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:29,400
Would that be
right?

760
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:30,443
No Way.

761
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:34,220
I don't mean to imply that I don't think
probably he meant to imply it either,

762
00:45:34,221 --> 00:45:37,100
but his point I think was more 
particularly that

763
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,493
the demise of fixed religious systems 
would necessarily mean that the 

764
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:47,210
conflicts of the 20th century would be 
ideologically motivated,

765
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:52,220
specifically ideologically motivated as 
annuity ologies rose up to try to occupy

766
00:45:52,221 --> 00:45:53,054
the territory.
That previous ideology or religion 

767
00:45:56,451 --> 00:45:58,700
really hasn't been any allergy because 
most of them,

768
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:03,380
most of our religion is implicit and 
most of the ideologies exploits it.

769
00:46:03,381 --> 00:46:05,280
I think because someone actually wrote 
it down,

770
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,890
call it Karma isn't,
for example,

771
00:46:06,891 --> 00:46:07,724
is more likely to a sense more like a 
scientific system because all the 

772
00:46:09,291 --> 00:46:13,880
presuppositions are actually
are actually explicit,

773
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:17,060
so I think there's some reason for 
distinguishing niche.

774
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:17,903
You thought,
well these new ideologies would 

775
00:46:18,511 --> 00:46:19,344
necessarily rise up to who occupied the 
position of ideology and that we'd see 

776
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,790
more fair on a grand scale in Europe as 
a consequence of that.

777
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:29,810
So no,
because it's not reasonable to say that.

778
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,630
It's hard to say know because people 
compare what Stalin did,

779
00:46:35,631 --> 00:46:37,340
for example,
in the name of videology,

780
00:46:37,341 --> 00:46:38,174
to what the Catholic Church didn't,
Spain during the period of the 

781
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:42,164
inquisition.
The inquisition was nowhere near as 

782
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:46,663
horrifying as the Stalinist purges,
but it's difficult to tell if that's 

783
00:46:50,481 --> 00:46:51,314
because the motivation different or 
because by the time of stolen the 

784
00:46:54,741 --> 00:46:59,741
technology for implementing inquisition 
like procedures were so far advanced,

785
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:01,303
so
solzhenitsyn believed the Stalinist 

786
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,270
purges were worse than anything that had
happened in Russia,

787
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,370
his previous history under the czar and 
worse than this,

788
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:16,610
the inquisition as well,
but again,

789
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,980
there's this complicating technology,
so I don't know what to say about that.

790
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:21,913
Precisely.
I don't think people have probably 

791
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:25,574
changed that much,
so have the people who ran the Spanish 

792
00:47:29,531 --> 00:47:32,080
inquisition had access to the 
technology,

793
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:35,110
the product just this horrible.

794
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:37,863
Okay.
For the structure of scientific 

795
00:47:38,681 --> 00:47:39,880
revolutions,
Kuhn

796
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,533
couldn't basically attempts to 
demonstrate that this bouncing ball 

797
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:50,110
diagram also applies in the scientific 
domain.

798
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:52,523
That's not exactly right.
He attempted to say that a process like 

799
00:47:57,041 --> 00:48:02,041
this applied in the scientific domain
without necessarily considering the fact

800
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:05,080
that it might characterize all cognitive
revolutions,

801
00:48:05,081 --> 00:48:07,570
including those that operate in the 
domain of morality.

802
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:08,943
The reason I want you to read this book 
is because one of the risks of the 

803
00:48:11,501 --> 00:48:16,501
approach that I take in this class is 
over reliance on a few sources.

804
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:18,760
I tend to rely heavily on you,
for example,

805
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,083
and that's partly because they're the 
only people that I know who actually 

806
00:48:23,021 --> 00:48:23,854
deal with this material.
So I don't think it's so much narrower 

807
00:48:25,881 --> 00:48:26,714
as just lack of options.
But I wanted you to read Kuhn because 

808
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:30,940
you've.
Well that way you can.

809
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:32,690
That's a book that was very well 
received.

810
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:33,523
They made become world famous.
It was published in I think 1960 in 

811
00:48:35,941 --> 00:48:37,990
1962.
Um,

812
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:40,403
I want you to see for yourself that 
these sorts of ideas appear relevant in 

813
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:47,303
other fields and have been discovered by
other people who are working from 

814
00:48:51,301 --> 00:48:52,134
entirely different,
from entirely different set of 

815
00:48:54,091 --> 00:48:54,924
presuppositions.
And also because you have such a 

816
00:48:57,481 --> 00:48:58,314
terrible academic reputation,
which I can on and on actually 

817
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,200
understanding to,
to allow you to see for yourself that an

818
00:49:08,491 --> 00:49:09,324
idea that made kill and world famous and
in 1960 was positive 30 or 40 years 

819
00:49:14,161 --> 00:49:18,390
earlier by you on a much broader scale 
and was as far as I can tell,

820
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:22,470
more or less completely overlooked.
I don't know why that is.

821
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:27,300
Anyways,
the devils.

822
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:31,230
Okay.
The Devil's paradise lost notes from the

823
00:49:31,231 --> 00:49:32,064
underground and the Gulag archipelago.
I'll make a unit and the unit is a 

824
00:49:35,881 --> 00:49:40,881
discussion of the negative aspect of the
individual paradise lost.

825
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,460
This is the first time I've used this 
book in this course.

826
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,433
Paradise lost is the story of the fall 
of the devil from having now what he 

827
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,020
tried to do while he tried to do two 
things,

828
00:49:55,021 --> 00:49:57,870
he said he was trying to justify the 
ways of God to man,

829
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:01,920
which is an amazingly ambitious project.
No,

830
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:06,980
it's amazing that someone would take it 
upon themselves to too seriously conduct

831
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:08,004
an enterprise like that.
But also what he did was there's a kind 

832
00:50:12,121 --> 00:50:13,740
of a,
okay,

833
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:14,933
remember I used the example and you say,
if you want it to think about what art 

834
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:18,714
and mythology does with relationship to 
the construction of knowledge that you 

835
00:50:21,841 --> 00:50:22,674
might think that if you think of culture
as an island and the processes around 

836
00:50:27,651 --> 00:50:28,484
the edge of the island being 
qualitatively different from those in 

837
00:50:30,621 --> 00:50:33,520
the Middle Myth and art sort of 
circulate around outside,

838
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,260
say as information goes more towards the
center,

839
00:50:36,261 --> 00:50:37,094
tends to give,
take more on the shape of Dogma or 

840
00:50:39,111 --> 00:50:41,420
codified knowledge,
and on the outside it's less,

841
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:46,510
it's more amorphous and it seems to be 
contained more an image that's,

842
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,350
that's my impression anyways.

843
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,180
Last verbal,
more image.

844
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:51,163
The farther out it isn't.
Our at the farthest reaches its still 

845
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:56,060
behavior.
It's in ritual and seemed invitation.

846
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,680
Don't even really have an image of it 
yet.

847
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:01,310
You just acted out.
Not only can you not talk about it,

848
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:03,950
you can't form an accurate image of it,
but you can still act about.

849
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:04,803
But anyways,
what Milton did was to collect a myth 

850
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:13,040
that have formed around the central core
of Christianity.

851
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,173
And to give it a more or less formal 
structure and the math is the notion 

852
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:22,850
that there is a rebellion in heaven and 
that the devil fell.

853
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,760
Who was God's highest angel?
One of his two sons.

854
00:51:25,761 --> 00:51:28,090
I guess one.
The other one being Christ say to be the

855
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,933
oldest son rebelled against God in an 
attempt to occupy this position and was 

856
00:51:33,621 --> 00:51:35,270
cast into hell.
Oh,

857
00:51:35,271 --> 00:51:36,104
it's an interesting.
It's a story that has always running 

858
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:41,960
around in my mind for some peculiar 
reason.

859
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:44,600
Lucifer means light,
bringer,

860
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:49,100
and Lucifer is the agent of 
consciousness,

861
00:51:49,101 --> 00:51:50,840
even in genesis.
As far as that,

862
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:55,841
that's my particular take on it anyway.
As Lucifer is the serpent who gives both

863
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:56,953
eve and Adam,
the apple that makes them self 

864
00:51:59,271 --> 00:52:00,104
conscious.
He brings them to the light and the 

865
00:52:01,761 --> 00:52:02,594
Bible represents that as a catastrophe.
Obviously people get thrown out of 

866
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:08,330
paradise,
but there's some split.

867
00:52:08,331 --> 00:52:09,770
There was apparently,
according to young,

868
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:11,840
there's even split in the Medieval 
Christianity,

869
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:12,903
the the absolute negative quality of 
that particular event because it was 

870
00:52:17,091 --> 00:52:17,924
also regarded as a fortunate error 
because the fact that Adam and Eve got 

871
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:22,964
kicked out of paradise provided the 
precondition for the necessary 

872
00:52:25,911 --> 00:52:28,070
appearance of Christ who is a savior or 
hero.

873
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:33,590
So anyways,
I'm interested.

874
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:36,763
Look,
Christianity took the discussion at the 

875
00:52:38,961 --> 00:52:43,190
devil and his nature farther than any 
other form of religion has ever taken.

876
00:52:43,191 --> 00:52:48,191
The discussion of of evil could say that
for us to conceptualize,

877
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:53,710
say as a culture,
we have been trying to abstract out from

878
00:52:54,501 --> 00:52:55,334
our general behaviors,
the pattern that characterized as evil 

879
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:05,500
ever since we attempted to map who we 
were has a conscious endeavor.

880
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:06,583
Which is to say that we've taken 10 tens
of thousands of years to try to come to 

881
00:53:10,641 --> 00:53:13,930
grips with the essential nature of the 
behavioral pattern,

882
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,090
their attitude pattern that characterize
as evil.

883
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:17,563
You know,
we obviously still don't have a very 

884
00:53:19,041 --> 00:53:19,874
good verbal description of what that 
means because you can't just go up to 

885
00:53:22,341 --> 00:53:23,960
your neighbor and say,
you know,

886
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:24,973
spoke me off a paragraph or two that 
will define the boundaries of behavior 

887
00:53:30,061 --> 00:53:32,370
that would generally be recognized as 
evil.

888
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:33,690
We don't know that you say.

889
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:34,441
You could say,
well,

890
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:35,274
I knew it when I see it,
which means that it's still kind of 

891
00:53:37,501 --> 00:53:38,334
implicit knowledge.
I would say that the idea of the devil 

892
00:53:42,541 --> 00:53:46,560
seemed to have derived from zero astrium
religion.

893
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:49,143
There's a garden zoroastrianism named 
her a Mazda and he has two sons whose 

894
00:53:53,281 --> 00:53:56,310
names escape me.
That was the first religion,

895
00:53:56,570 --> 00:54:00,300
and by the way,
those are osteons also believed that the

896
00:54:00,301 --> 00:54:01,134
universe was engaged in an internal 
battle between the forces of good and 

897
00:54:03,571 --> 00:54:05,430
evil and that they were basically 
balanced,

898
00:54:05,431 --> 00:54:08,170
which Christianity didn't,
didn't exactly dog that.

899
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:13,660
It's referring to this as well.
The battle between good neat.

900
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,470
Anyways,
Christianity's things the end,

901
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:22,680
he started fuel from the self is there,
thereby leaving it to be repressed and.

902
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:23,761
Well,
it's something.

903
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:24,720
Yeah,
it's something that's.

904
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:25,930
Well,
the thing you know,

905
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:28,940
there's a lot of sense in this story.
What about original?

906
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:29,831
Well,
yes,

907
00:54:29,831 --> 00:54:30,664
but it wasn't a young.
One of the things that young find out 

908
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,780
was that the triumvirate of that the 
trinity are there.

909
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:39,380
That is,
that is God is really a fraternity.

910
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:40,403
The debt and the devil attacks attempts 
to eliminate the evil from from the 

911
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:47,191
individual.
Yeah.

912
00:54:47,191 --> 00:54:50,560
Well that was something that you can 
have a particular moment about boat,

913
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:51,413
about Christianity with because he 
thought that he thought exactly what 

914
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:58,830
Christianity tended to view evil as the 
absence of God,

915
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:03,330
whereas young tended to view it as a,
as an actual presence in and of itself,

916
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:07,530
something that was complex enough and 
solid enough so to speak,

917
00:55:07,531 --> 00:55:08,364
that you couldn't just account for it by
the absence of something good and that 

918
00:55:11,821 --> 00:55:12,654
was a,
I suppose in medieval times that would 

919
00:55:15,631 --> 00:55:17,950
be needed as a remarkably heretical 
state.

920
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,220
So that was humans particular take on 
it,

921
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:21,323
but there are good reasons for believing
the opposite to the to to believe that 

922
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:28,530
evil can be understood as the absence of
good.

923
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:29,633
That's a real logical argument to.
I don't think it's one that you'll give 

924
00:55:31,741 --> 00:55:32,574
enough credence to that is that it's 
still your presentation is what he 

925
00:55:37,051 --> 00:55:38,910
thought.
Anyways,

926
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:44,020
let's get back to this myth
Lucifer's associated with rationality in

927
00:55:48,031 --> 00:55:48,864
Christian mythology,
and the reason I want you to read 

928
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:57,570
paradise lost is because I think what 
paradise lost is about,

929
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:58,860
and this is,
I don't know,

930
00:55:58,861 --> 00:55:59,694
this is pure speculation on my part,
is certainly about something that we 

931
00:56:03,431 --> 00:56:06,030
know people have been working on 
building that myth for a long,

932
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:07,200
long,
long time.

933
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:09,420
It's about something but what it's 
about,

934
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:14,070
and I doubt very much if it's a 
description of empirical reality.

935
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:15,533
So it's about something else and what 
that meant says is that the highest 

936
00:56:20,071 --> 00:56:20,904
angel in God's kingdom,
which I would view as something as a 

937
00:56:23,261 --> 00:56:25,300
description of an interest psychic 
state,

938
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:27,430
the place where there are spirit,
so to speak,

939
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:32,880
attempted to you serve God's position 
which is characterized by omnipotent,

940
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,450
omniscient,
omnipotent,

941
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,970
and uh,
it was pretty.

942
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:40,270
The other one is three cardinal 
attributes of God should omniscience,

943
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:42,610
omnipotence,
omnipresence,

944
00:56:42,611 --> 00:56:44,390
right?
Said,

945
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,920
I can occupy the position of God 
instantly.

946
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:49,650
He's inhale.
Now,

947
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,290
I think what that means,
and this is something that from northrop

948
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:56,440
prior also commented on was the
say,

949
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:59,320
if you think of the development of 
rationality,

950
00:56:59,321 --> 00:57:00,154
Cuban rationality,
which is one of the things that 

951
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:05,470
necessarily distinguishes us from the 
animals in which western culture has put

952
00:57:05,471 --> 00:57:10,210
more stress on than any other culture.
I think that can be reasonably portrayed

953
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:13,960
from the mythological perspective as the
highest angel in God's heavenly kingdom,

954
00:57:13,961 --> 00:57:14,794
so to speak.
Think about that as the description of 

955
00:57:16,181 --> 00:57:19,180
an inter psychic hierarchy.
What that says,

956
00:57:19,181 --> 00:57:24,181
that what that says is that if 
rationality construct something and then

957
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:30,040
attempts to make of it a god,
instantly everything around it will turn

958
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:33,820
into something that resembles hail 10.
It's a story about.

959
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:38,110
I think it's a story about the dangers 
of authoritarian presumption,

960
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:39,663
so I want you to read it in the context 
of these other works and you can make 

961
00:57:43,241 --> 00:57:45,550
your own judgment about that.
Which is to say,

962
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:47,440
look,
all it is is to say this.

963
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:48,603
If you construct the system of belief
with your rational faculties and then 

964
00:57:54,341 --> 00:57:56,980
make up that system,
something that has all the attributes of

965
00:57:56,981 --> 00:57:57,814
God,
then what will necessarily happen 

966
00:58:00,641 --> 00:58:03,700
because you're completely opaque to any 
anomalous information,

967
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:04,803
is that within a brief span of time,
everything around you will turn into a 

968
00:58:08,021 --> 00:58:08,854
wasteland and also that all you have to 
do to get out of it is admitting that 

969
00:58:12,731 --> 00:58:13,564
you're wrong,
which is one of the things that happens 

970
00:58:15,031 --> 00:58:15,864
to milk Satan by the way,
all he has to do to get out of where he 

971
00:58:17,681 --> 00:58:19,030
is is admit that he was wrong.

972
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:21,040
That's it,
but he won't do that.

973
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:25,510
So I would rather I'd rather rule 
inhaled and serve in heaven and I,

974
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,060
I think from my perspective as a 
clinical psychologist,

975
00:58:28,061 --> 00:58:28,894
that that's the most accurate 
representation of neurotic personality 

976
00:58:31,481 --> 00:58:34,480
that I've ever encountered.
So that's exactly the situation.

977
00:58:34,481 --> 00:58:37,000
Just like you're doing something that 
follows up your life,

978
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,873
you'd rather do that than change 
specifically as you because you're the 

979
00:58:42,071 --> 00:58:43,570
master of it.
That's right.

980
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,520
It's knowing what we know how that 
works.

981
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:47,670
It's unknown territory,
isn't it?

982
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:48,953
Because you don't have to.
You don't have to go through this 

983
00:58:50,141 --> 00:58:51,340
process,
for example,

984
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,830
to stay there.
It might be miserable and it's gonna get

985
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:57,910
worse all the time and it will get as 
bad as it can possibly be.

986
00:58:58,990 --> 00:58:59,850
Oh,
you have to do.

987
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:03,520
To get rid of it is to pause that.
If you stepped outside of it's something

988
00:59:03,521 --> 00:59:05,320
good might happen,
but you won't do that.

989
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:10,320
So is that what you mean when you talk 
about Communist Roger?

990
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:12,100
Yes,
absolutely.

991
00:59:12,101 --> 00:59:14,380
That's an idea.
That's exactly it.

992
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,453
If you think of that though,
it's difficult within the domains of 

993
00:59:17,441 --> 00:59:19,240
rationality during depression,
ality.

994
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:21,140
Yeah,
way.

995
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:23,550
Well,
that's not necessarily the case level.

996
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:25,353
I'll give you right away.
We're talking about the relative 

997
00:59:28,221 --> 00:59:31,700
importance of phenomena.
So let's let's look at it this way.

998
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,133
Say what your rationality does this help
you make sense of phenomena that you 

999
00:59:36,711 --> 00:59:40,520
encountered,
but it is not necessarily the thing that

1000
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:41,383
propels you forward to the place where 
you'll find something to make sense out 

1001
00:59:44,621 --> 00:59:45,454
of.
I would say that so I would say that 

1002
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:51,500
your rationality is doing a proper job,
which means that it's in the right place

1003
00:59:51,501 --> 00:59:52,334
in the hierarchy values.
If it's always serving the tendency to 

1004
00:59:55,821 --> 00:59:59,660
go out and make order out of chaos.
Now if you.

1005
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,120
That's not rationality,
that's something else.

1006
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:04,520
That's the thing that makes rationality 
useful.

1007
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:07,670
Right?
But if your rationality and then it sort

1008
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:09,590
of follows,
but you wouldn't understand this,

1009
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:12,170
you wouldn't necessarily like it.
That's right.

1010
01:00:12,171 --> 01:00:13,004
Well,
you don't necessarily want the 

1011
01:00:13,551 --> 01:00:14,384
subordinate position.
It's something that's very relevant to 

1012
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:18,350
western culture because I believe this 
is the case.

1013
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:19,453
I hope this is true.
I believe that after the French 

1014
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:22,963
revolution,
one of the first things that happened 

1015
01:00:23,991 --> 01:00:24,824
was the erection of a statue to the 
goddess of reason in Notre Dame 

1016
01:00:27,381 --> 01:00:29,630
cathedral.
Does anybody know if that's true?

1017
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:34,700
I think that was one of the immediate 
post revolutionary acts,

1018
01:00:34,701 --> 01:00:36,500
but it's very.
It's very symbolic.

1019
01:00:36,501 --> 01:00:37,334
I think because the French Revolution 
was one of the first extra religious 

1020
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,333
movements in western culture understands
the attempt to put reason up on the 

1021
01:00:46,011 --> 01:00:49,160
highest pedestal and there's a problem 
with that.

1022
01:00:49,161 --> 01:00:51,590
And that's the problem that Milton,
I think was wrestling with and said,

1023
01:00:51,591 --> 01:00:52,041
well,
yeah,

1024
01:00:52,041 --> 01:00:54,650
you know,
rationalities a good master,

1025
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:57,530
good servant,
but it's a terrible master.

1026
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,500
So then the question is what's supposed 
to be the master?

1027
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:01,543
Now,
the thing that's interesting about this 

1028
01:01:02,331 --> 01:01:03,164
is there's,
there's a line of mythology and 

1029
01:01:04,551 --> 01:01:05,384
Christianity that sort of points out 
that this is vague again and there's no 

1030
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:11,390
canonical basis board as far as I know,
but the,

1031
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:13,030
uh,
that the,

1032
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:14,013
that Satan was the gods,
oldest son who was passed over in favor 

1033
01:01:17,391 --> 01:01:18,980
of the youngest son who was Christ.

1034
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,930
And that's a common mythological theme 
by the way,

1035
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:21,764
that the passing over of the older and 
wiser son and in favor of the younger 

1036
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:30,170
and more questionable son,
that's part of the,

1037
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:31,910
that's part of the mythology,
the trickster.

1038
01:01:31,911 --> 01:01:36,410
But anyways,
the point is here is that rationality.

1039
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:38,023
It's supposed to serve the
as opposed to certainly hero and not to 

1040
01:01:44,931 --> 01:01:45,764
constrain it.
So you can say it's supposed to be 

1041
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:50,990
subordinate,
supposed to be a subordinate process,

1042
01:01:50,991 --> 01:01:52,790
and as soon as it's known as supportive 
process,

1043
01:01:52,791 --> 01:01:57,050
which means as soon as it says,
what I have created is everything that's

1044
01:01:57,051 --> 01:01:59,130
necessary,
then it then it.

1045
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,050
While that's tantamount to this 
revolution in heaven,

1046
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:07,270
this is my spot.
No,

1047
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:09,763
no,
no,

1048
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:10,870
no.
That's,

1049
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:16,210
that's a really good observation because
star trek is pure mythology to boldly go

1050
01:02:16,671 --> 01:02:19,130
where no man has ever gone,
no one now,

1051
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:21,213
but that's.
That's right,

1052
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,193
because it's a well constructed and 
spock is subordinate to the 

1053
01:02:25,261 --> 01:02:28,380
irrationalities of the human beings.
That's right,

1054
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,460
and the drive and the drive to explore.
Right.

1055
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:32,250
Great.
Great.

1056
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:36,340
Very Fun.
They also has pointed ears and have a

1057
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:43,010
of
data,

1058
01:02:44,810 --> 01:02:46,200
right?
Right.

1059
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,540
Rationale,
rationale,

1060
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:57,783
all knowing,
all knowing is the big thing as far as 

1061
01:02:59,971 --> 01:03:03,540
I'm concerned with regards to radiology,
because that's what an ideology does,

1062
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:04,890
right?
If you're an authoritarian,

1063
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,270
although you.
Sorry,

1064
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:10,390
go ahead.
Talking about

1065
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:17,150
religion might be trying to tell about 
his or her place within a community.

1066
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,730
I'm trying to lead into that in today's 
discussion,

1067
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:26,640
and this is all sort of preliminary 
material,

1068
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,640
but most of the last half of the course 
talks about this,

1069
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,810
this relationship,
which is what you're trying.

1070
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:33,683
What's the.
What's the proper balance between the 

1071
01:03:35,581 --> 01:03:36,610
individual and that culture?

1072
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:44,880
Is the idea that religion is supposed to
liberate the individual.

1073
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,110
How.
Okay.

1074
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:51,210
Given that line of reasoning,
what,

1075
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:54,240
what would you use as the definition of 
self?

1076
01:03:56,020 --> 01:04:01,020
The Ego in another words that that 
everything is within my own self.

1077
01:04:03,241 --> 01:04:08,241
Everything I see and what's real,
what I see is real.

1078
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,353
What you may see is not necessarily 
right because I'm operating within 

1079
01:04:14,241 --> 01:04:17,400
myself.
The idea of liberation from the prisons.

1080
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:19,560
I mean that would.
I think in part

1081
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,273
the problem is is that there's two 
aspects to the systems as a general 

1082
01:04:26,131 --> 01:04:26,964
rule,
there's the aspect that socializes and 

1083
01:04:28,861 --> 01:04:29,694
then there's the aspect that attempts to
transcend the consequences of 

1084
01:04:31,891 --> 01:04:34,560
socialization and they tend to work at 
cross purposes.

1085
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:38,930
That's why one of the stories you'll 
read later in the manuscript is

1086
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,590
edited it down.
Dostoevsky story,

1087
01:04:43,591 --> 01:04:46,410
the grand inquisitor and then the grand 
inquisitor.

1088
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:51,930
Christ comes back to Earth and he runs 
into the inquisitive who says,

1089
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:55,380
who in prisons prison immediately we're 
going to kill you.

1090
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:58,560
You established this,
but now that it's here,

1091
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:01,560
you shouldn't come back to mess it up.
Fine.

1092
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,560
The next day when he was supposed to 
kill him,

1093
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:07,430
he lets him go out the back door.
Well,

1094
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:08,713
that's regarded as sort of as the 
pinnacle of Dostoyevsky's literary 

1095
01:05:11,101 --> 01:05:13,290
achievement.
A particular story,

1096
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:16,260
and it is a brilliant story because it 
basically says that,

1097
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,040
well,
and this is

1098
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,870
mostly with regards to the Catholic 
church,

1099
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:23,980
that religion necessarily has to impose 
a structure.

1100
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,400
It has to because if there's no 
structure,

1101
01:05:27,401 --> 01:05:31,270
there's no protection,
but in order to maintain that structure,

1102
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:35,440
it has to allow the process that creates
it in order to exist,

1103
01:05:35,441 --> 01:05:36,274
at least to the degree that it can 
continue to update the structure and 

1104
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:42,480
that's like.
That's exactly dead on.

1105
01:05:42,481 --> 01:05:46,300
Relevant to your question with regards 
to the proper role of the relationship,

1106
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:49,330
proper role of the individual with 
regards to culture.

1107
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,060
It's the same relationship that the 
Pharaoh,

1108
01:05:52,061 --> 01:05:52,894
how do you need you to society.
You're supposed to embody the culture 

1109
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:57,283
and I would think in part the notion of 
the prison of the self is partly the 

1110
01:06:00,671 --> 01:06:01,504
idea that you embodied the culture which
is that you swallowed the particular 

1111
01:06:06,521 --> 01:06:09,850
morality and the ways and the means that
your culture says to act,

1112
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:11,740
but then there's this other part which 
says,

1113
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:14,170
yeah,
you are that endure necessarily that,

1114
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:18,460
but you're also the thing that created 
that and the thing that can update it.

1115
01:06:18,461 --> 01:06:19,720
When when necessary,

1116
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,680
you also swallowed religion,
which creates,

1117
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:27,790
and I'm not necessarily sure that 
religion was free.

1118
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:31,010
No Man from the south because it creates
a suffolk.

1119
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:32,813
Well,
it depends.

1120
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:35,080
It depends.
I mean it because you have to send.

1121
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:36,853
Okay.
This leads in directly to what we were 

1122
01:06:38,191 --> 01:06:42,020
going to decide what we were going to 
discuss today because I,

1123
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:42,893
I,
I titled the Chapter That We're 

1124
01:06:44,491 --> 01:06:45,324
discussing today apprenticeship that 
inculturation and that has to do with 

1125
01:06:48,751 --> 01:06:49,584
the adoption of a shared map and so the 
issue is going to look at this 

1126
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:56,370
particular diagram.
I want to read you something again.

1127
01:06:58,860 --> 01:06:59,693
I'll get to this one sec.
I just wanted to finish going through 

1128
01:07:01,201 --> 01:07:02,034
these books.
The last three books have to do with 

1129
01:07:05,130 --> 01:07:08,190
alchemy and they ultimately is a 
discussion.

1130
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:09,093
Humans writing something with me anyways
or discussion of a collection of 2000 

1131
01:07:12,541 --> 01:07:13,374
years of symbols.
The yellow thought illustrated that 

1132
01:07:15,721 --> 01:07:16,554
process,
which is the process of radical re 

1133
01:07:19,831 --> 01:07:21,150
adaptation.
So

1134
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:26,700
I want to read you something for me.
It's kind of long,

1135
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:28,350
but I want you to listen to it 
carefully.

1136
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:32,250
This is from the navel and if you want,
if you listened to this,

1137
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:33,143
then you'll also know why I want you to 
read beyond good and evil because the 

1138
01:07:35,221 --> 01:07:37,430
whole book is like this,
not just this particular.

1139
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:45,120
Every morality is as opposed to letting 
oneself go,

1140
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:50,660
a bit of tyranny against nature also 
against reason,

1141
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:52,703
but this in itself is no objection as 
long as we do have some other morality 

1142
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:57,743
which permits us to decree that every 
kind of tyranny and unreasonable is 

1143
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:00,943
impermissible
what is essential and didn't ask to 

1144
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:07,160
mobile in every morality because 
they've.

1145
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:12,190
It constitutes a long compulsion
to understand stoicism or puritanism.

1146
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:15,383
One should recall the compulsion or 
whichever language so far has achieved 

1147
01:08:18,021 --> 01:08:18,854
strength and freedom.
The metrical compulsion of rhyme and 

1148
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:22,710
rhythm.
Okay,

1149
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:24,500
so what Nietzsche is trying to say,
there's

1150
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:33,130
that there's a necessary relationship 
between morality and slavery.

1151
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:39,100
To adopt any particular viewpoint means 
to exclude all other viewpoints,

1152
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:40,983
but also that having done so,
having adopted one limited viewpoint 

1153
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:46,323
means the possibility to develop all 
sorts of skills that you might not 

1154
01:08:48,941 --> 01:08:51,290
otherwise be able to develop.
So it uses the metaphor.

1155
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:52,173
Poetry says,
look what a poet does to produce poetry 

1156
01:08:56,770 --> 01:09:01,600
and to develop the language is to put 
way more constraint on his or her domain

1157
01:09:01,601 --> 01:09:05,080
of action than is normally the case and 
paradoxically,

1158
01:09:05,081 --> 01:09:07,360
as a consequence of applying this 
constraint,

1159
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:10,720
something is created instead of just 
being repressed.

1160
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:16,120
So you say you don't have to only allow 
yourself to write in rhyme and rhythm.

1161
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:18,063
It's much more difficult to do that 
which you might say would constitute a 

1162
01:09:21,011 --> 01:09:24,430
barrier to achievement,
but Nietzsche is pointing out that it is

1163
01:09:24,431 --> 01:09:25,264
in fact the position of those 
constraints that constitutes the 

1164
01:09:27,551 --> 01:09:29,020
precondition for freedom.

1165
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:30,273
So he's making a strange,
strange claim that under in some 

1166
01:09:33,821 --> 01:09:34,654
contexts of interpretation,
slavery as a necessary precondition for 

1167
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:39,460
freedom go.
Then the question is,

1168
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:40,803
you better understand the context in 
which that's true and the context in 

1169
01:09:44,921 --> 01:09:47,800
which that's not great and we'll but 
we'll get to that later.

1170
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:52,000
How much trouble the poets and orators 
of all peoples have taken,

1171
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:53,433
not accepting a few prose writers today 
and who's he are there dwells in 

1172
01:09:55,881 --> 01:09:56,714
exhaustible conscience for the sake of 
some foolishness as utilitarian adults 

1173
01:10:01,601 --> 01:10:03,040
say,
feeling smart,

1174
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:06,910
submitted abjectly to capricious laws as
anarchists,

1175
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:09,550
say,
feeling free or even free spirited,

1176
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:15,300
but the curious fact is that all there 
is or has it been on earth of freedom,

1177
01:10:15,301 --> 01:10:16,650
subtlety,
boldness,

1178
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,513
dance and masterly.
Sharing this weather in thought itself 

1179
01:10:19,981 --> 01:10:24,180
or in government or in the rhetoric and 
persuasion in the arts,

1180
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:25,343
just as an ethics has developed only 
owing to the tyranny of such capricious 

1181
01:10:29,551 --> 01:10:30,384
laws.

1182
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:35,330
Every artist knows how far from any 
feeling of letting himself go.

1183
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:38,570
His most natural state is the free 
ordering,

1184
01:10:38,571 --> 01:10:39,700
placing,
disposing,

1185
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:40,543
giving form in the moment of inspiration
and how strictly and suddenly he obeys 

1186
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,353
thousand fold laws precisely then laws 
that precisely on account of their 

1187
01:10:49,611 --> 01:10:53,720
hardness and determination defy all 
formulation through concepts.

1188
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:58,280
Even the firmest concept is compared 
with them not free of fluctuation,

1189
01:10:58,281 --> 01:10:59,510
multiplicity,
and then,

1190
01:10:59,511 --> 01:11:02,030
but the other thing that needs she's 
pointing out there,

1191
01:11:02,031 --> 01:11:07,031
and this is an example of how,
how decades of thought that are still to

1192
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:11,880
come are embedded in his sentences.
Law,

1193
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:14,850
is that precisely on account of their 
hardness and determination,

1194
01:11:14,851 --> 01:11:17,760
defy all formulation through concepts.
He's saying,

1195
01:11:17,761 --> 01:11:21,420
well,
when you were free as an artist,

1196
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,780
your acting according to precepts that 
are inviolable,

1197
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:29,010
that are so archaic that you can't even 
say what they are.

1198
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:31,260
They're still implicit,
still implicit,

1199
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:32,730
right?
They're still procedural.

1200
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:39,650
What is essential in heaven and earth 
seems to be to say once again that there

1201
01:11:39,781 --> 01:11:40,614
should be obedience over a long period 
of time and in a single direction given 

1202
01:11:44,521 --> 01:11:45,354
that something worthwhile always 
develops and has developed for whose 

1203
01:11:47,431 --> 01:11:49,290
sake it is worthwhile to live on earth.

1204
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,850
For example,
virtue art,

1205
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:54,320
music,
dance reason,

1206
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:56,900
spirituality,
something transfiguring,

1207
01:11:56,901 --> 01:12:01,610
subtle Nad and divine.
The long unfreedom of the spirit.

1208
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:05,090
The mistrustful constraint in the 
communicability of thoughts.

1209
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:06,483
The disciplined thinkers imposed on 
themselves to think within the 

1210
01:12:08,961 --> 01:12:09,794
directions laid down by a church or a 
court or under era's Tutelian 

1211
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:17,330
presuppositions,
the long spiritual will to interpret all

1212
01:12:17,331 --> 01:12:22,220
events under a Christian Schema and to 
rediscover and justify the Christian God

1213
01:12:22,221 --> 01:12:25,070
and every accident.
All of this,

1214
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:27,770
however,
forced capricious hard,

1215
01:12:27,950 --> 01:12:28,783
gruesome and anti rash has shown itself 
to be the means through which the 

1216
01:12:32,691 --> 01:12:34,850
European spirit has been trained to 
strength,

1217
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:35,953
ruthless curiosity and subtle mobility,
although admittedly in the process and 

1218
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:44,270
irreplaceable amount of strength and 
spirit had to be crushed,

1219
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:45,373
stifled in the room
that for thousands of years of European 

1220
01:12:49,371 --> 01:12:51,470
thinkers thought merely in order to 
prove something

1221
01:12:53,050 --> 01:12:53,883
today.
Conversely,

1222
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:56,260
we suspect everything or who wants to 
prove something,

1223
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,353
that the conclusions that aren't to be 
the result of the most rigorous 

1224
01:13:00,401 --> 01:13:02,680
reflections were always settled from the
start,

1225
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:03,873
just as it use to be with Asiatic 
astrology and still is today with the 

1226
01:13:07,181 --> 01:13:08,014
innocuous Christian moral interpretation
of our most intimate personal 

1227
01:13:10,721 --> 01:13:13,470
experiences.
This tyranny,

1228
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,304
this Capris,
this rigorous and grandiose stupidity 

1229
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:20,710
because educated the spirit.
Slavery is as it seems,

1230
01:13:20,711 --> 01:13:22,870
both in the cruder and in the more 
subtle sense,

1231
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:23,793
the indispensable means of spiritual 
discipline and cultivation to consider 

1232
01:13:27,731 --> 01:13:29,230
any more,
lot with this in mind,

1233
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:34,660
what there is in it of nature,
teaches hatred of just letting go of any

1234
01:13:34,661 --> 01:13:35,494
all to great freedom and implants,
the need for limited horizons and the 

1235
01:13:38,741 --> 01:13:42,190
nearest tasks,
teaching the narrowing of perspective,

1236
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:44,830
and that's in a certain sense,
stupidity.

1237
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:45,953
As a condition of life and growth,
you shall obey someone in for a long 

1238
01:13:50,831 --> 01:13:54,670
time or else you will perish and lose 
the last respect for yourself.

1239
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:58,420
This appears to me to be the categorical
imperative of nature,

1240
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:03,210
which is not addressed to the 
individual,

1241
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:06,930
but to people's races,
ages and classes above all,

1242
01:14:06,931 --> 01:14:11,931
to the whole human animal to ma'am.
Brilliant.

1243
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,130
That's a brilliant page as far as I'm 
concerned.

1244
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:16,563
What's he saying in your question?
What's the proper relationship with 

1245
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:23,700
individual in culture with regards to 
you say,

1246
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:24,630
well,
what's what?

1247
01:14:24,631 --> 01:14:27,790
I wrote this,
this diagram on the board here.

1248
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:37,130
The unknown is both negative and 
positive

1249
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:42,430
and the culture is both negative and 
positive.

1250
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:43,293
Say you have to have a culture
because the culture brings 

1251
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:50,763
predictability to the objects that you 
encounter and to all of your 

1252
01:14:54,431 --> 01:14:55,264
interpersonal interactions.
You have to have that because that in 

1253
01:14:59,801 --> 01:15:03,460
its absence,
everything is so chaotic that you cannot

1254
01:15:03,461 --> 01:15:06,460
actually exist.
That's the literal,

1255
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:10,240
the literal truth.
Your culture regulates your emotions.

1256
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:11,523
You can't just give it up,
but if someone comes along with a 

1257
01:15:14,471 --> 01:15:15,304
different idea and that different idea,
if you accepted it would upset your 

1258
01:15:18,641 --> 01:15:20,020
whole culture.
Well,

1259
01:15:20,021 --> 01:15:20,854
you can't just accept that idea,
but the alternative to accepting it 

1260
01:15:24,491 --> 01:15:25,324
often seems to be to attempt to destroy 
the person who brings the new 

1261
01:15:28,241 --> 01:15:29,074
information.
And the problem with that is that now 

1262
01:15:31,571 --> 01:15:35,530
we're so heavily armed that if one camp 
attempts to destroy the other camp,

1263
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:38,110
the overwhelming likelihood is the both 
will disappear.

1264
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:42,700
So on the one hand you can't just get 
rid of your culture because someone else

1265
01:15:42,701 --> 01:15:44,590
comes along and says,
that's not the way to do things,

1266
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,313
but you can't do what we've always done 
in the past either which has have a war 

1267
01:15:49,601 --> 01:15:50,380
about it and said,
well,

1268
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,120
who's going to rule what territory?

1269
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:54,190
So then the question is,
well,

1270
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:58,960
given those two options,
as theoretically the only two options,

1271
01:15:58,961 --> 01:16:03,160
and then both the both the outcomes of 
those two options or negative well,

1272
01:16:03,161 --> 01:16:06,300
what's left to do well,
that's a real difficult question.

1273
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:08,050
That's a paradox as far as I'm 
concerned.

1274
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:09,393
Well,
this diagram has speaks to that to some 

1275
01:16:12,581 --> 01:16:13,780
degree,
say

1276
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:18,670
nature is pointing out that in order to 
be able to do anything,

1277
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:22,030
you have to restrict what it is that 
you're going to do to a narrow domain.

1278
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:26,280
This is the notion of an apprenticeship.
So if you want to become,

1279
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:27,123
let's say a classical pianists,
would they say to become a classical 

1280
01:16:29,831 --> 01:16:32,860
pianist,
you need 20,000 hours of practice before

1281
01:16:32,861 --> 01:16:36,490
the age of 18 to become a concert.
That's assuming you have the,

1282
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:38,020
you know,
the innate ability,

1283
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:40,143
which basically means if you have to 
exclude from your life any number of 

1284
01:16:43,691 --> 01:16:47,560
things that would have occupied those 
$20,000 alternatively,

1285
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:48,813
and that you have to subjugate all of 
your diverse individuality to this 

1286
01:16:53,591 --> 01:16:57,430
extraordinarily narrow range of,
of action.

1287
01:16:58,660 --> 01:16:59,493
But the theory is that having 
voluntarily subjugating yourself to a 

1288
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:09,470
set of arbitrary and fixed rules,
because the rules that make up music are

1289
01:17:09,471 --> 01:17:14,471
in many ways arbitrary and fixed,
that if you master that territory,

1290
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:20,020
then you'll come out the other side with
all of those skills at your disposal and

1291
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,344
then with the capacity to do something 
that actually constitutes free to have 

1292
01:17:23,730 --> 01:17:24,563
with them.
So the notion of the apprenticeship is 

1293
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:29,043
the long sub voluntary subjugation of 
the spirit followed by the capacity to 

1294
01:17:33,351 --> 01:17:36,410
create a masterpiece.
You know the word masterpiece

1295
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:40,960
that signifies the end of an 
apprenticeship right now.

1296
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:43,280
It's even though I suppose where the 
master's degree came from,

1297
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:44,863
is that a masterpiece indicates that you
are now free from the tyranny of the 

1298
01:17:48,051 --> 01:17:51,500
person to whom you were bound.
It means that you've absorbed everything

1299
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:52,334
they know,
plus you've added to what they knew and 

1300
01:17:54,801 --> 01:17:55,634
transmitted to you.
Something that's uniquely yours that 

1301
01:17:58,731 --> 01:18:00,980
justifies the entire subjugation.

1302
01:18:03,070 --> 01:18:05,570
Well,
that's that for me,

1303
01:18:05,571 --> 01:18:10,190
that seems to be the way out the of this
cultural paradox because

1304
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:14,180
that's an apprenticeship model of 
adolescence.

1305
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:15,133
I think that group identity is
the construction and strengthening of 

1306
01:18:21,711 --> 01:18:26,711
group identity is the appropriate 
developmental stage for adolescents that

1307
01:18:28,401 --> 01:18:31,330
it has to be gone through and this gets 
rid of some of.

1308
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,413
I think some of the more annoying 
aspects of standard humanistic 

1309
01:18:34,911 --> 01:18:35,744
psychology says you have to accept as a 
precondition that subjugate yourself to 

1310
01:18:40,221 --> 01:18:41,054
a set of rules that a lot of what you 
are is going to not be developed in the 

1311
01:18:45,381 --> 01:18:46,214
process because you always sacrifice 
possibility for actuality if you pursue 

1312
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:52,940
any actuality,
but the hope is that you'll come out the

1313
01:18:52,941 --> 01:18:57,680
other side with whatever is used still 
in tact and it seems to me that.

1314
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:04,250
Well that gives you the benefits of both
situations.

1315
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:10,180
If you say the purpose of culture is to 
predict,

1316
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:13,933
protect the individual who's no longer a
child from the negative aspect of the 

1317
01:19:18,561 --> 01:19:21,380
unknown.
Say children are dependent on their,

1318
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:23,300
on their mother,
so to speak.

1319
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:26,990
Initially
as they grow,

1320
01:19:26,991 --> 01:19:27,824
they start to
encounter problems in living that their 

1321
01:19:31,491 --> 01:19:35,390
mother can no longer solve.
Example hundred.

1322
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:36,243
Both conditions like in our culture.
If you're a male and you're 14 and your 

1323
01:19:39,561 --> 01:19:40,394
brother is still trying to solve the 
problem of finding someone to date for 

1324
01:19:44,391 --> 01:19:45,224
you,
something seriously has gone wrong 

1325
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,133
because she's attempting to extend her 
domain of protection past it's logical 

1326
01:19:52,431 --> 01:19:53,264
bounce,
which is to say the psychoanalysts used 

1327
01:19:54,801 --> 01:19:57,200
to refer to that as the necessary 
failure of the mother.

1328
01:19:57,201 --> 01:19:59,660
Anyways.
The point is is that as you grow up,

1329
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:03,890
life starts to present to you problems 
that weren't there to begin with,

1330
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:04,843
that your other campaign and what moves 
in fill the gap before you're fully 

1331
01:20:09,451 --> 01:20:14,190
mature is is the processes associated 
with group identification.

1332
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:15,503
So it's like.
I think it's a bridging bridging 

1333
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:19,323
mechanism.
I think the problem that we face as a 

1334
01:20:22,111 --> 01:20:22,944
race in a sense is that we're stuck at 
an adolescent level of of adaptation is 

1335
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:34,371
that people even still view the 
identification with the culture,

1336
01:20:34,471 --> 01:20:37,020
which is essentially the adoption of a 
patriotic stance.

1337
01:20:37,021 --> 01:20:37,854
That's when we're looking at it as the 
highest level of possible obtained 

1338
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:43,290
insurance people never individually.
Well,

1339
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:47,310
that's
rarely enough.

1340
01:20:47,311 --> 01:20:48,144
So that being stuck at the level of 
cultural identification still poses a 

1341
01:20:51,301 --> 01:20:56,301
major constant threat to her poses a 
constant threat.

1342
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:59,160
So not a blanket statement,
obviously,

1343
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:01,380
right?
Not a blanket statement because.

1344
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:05,880
But I guess the.
I guess the idea of perhaps is that well

1345
01:21:05,881 --> 01:21:06,714
at least that something beyond mere 
adequate group identification might 

1346
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:14,430
realistically be posited as an ideal 
without,

1347
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:15,473
without necessarily undermining the idea
that group identification as a 

1348
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:21,983
developmental stage is absolutely 
necessary and that it has to be gone 

1349
01:21:25,681 --> 01:21:26,220
through.

1350
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:27,053
Like I mean you see people who,
who never made the transition to group 

1351
01:21:30,811 --> 01:21:31,644
identity,
which means that they remain dependent 

1352
01:21:33,091 --> 01:21:34,830
on their mother.
That's A.

1353
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:37,110
There's a whole category of personality 
disorder for that.

1354
01:21:37,111 --> 01:21:37,944
That's dependent personality disorder.
They don't even make the first 

1355
01:21:40,111 --> 01:21:40,944
transition.
People who get through the group 

1356
01:21:43,771 --> 01:21:44,604
identification process,
I think very often are those who 

1357
01:21:46,531 --> 01:21:47,364
actually mastered it.
So they have gone through an 

1358
01:21:48,811 --> 01:21:49,644
apprenticeship,
which means they've allowed themselves 

1359
01:21:50,971 --> 01:21:55,380
to be subjugated to the group identity 
and have absorbed all the discipline and

1360
01:21:55,381 --> 01:22:00,381
possibility that that subjugation
subjugation allows me to send you.

1361
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:02,903
Some people do
manage to reach to go beyond that stage 

1362
01:22:08,251 --> 01:22:11,070
without having very much group 
identification

1363
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,033
managed to reach the estate reach 
individuation without going through a 

1364
01:22:18,361 --> 01:22:19,194
great deal.
Okay.

1365
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:21,810
Okay.
Can you think of an example of that?

1366
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:25,380
Because I'm not convinced that that's 
the case.

1367
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:26,340
I think that these.

1368
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:27,173
I think that this is an invariant 
developmental stage that you can make 

1369
01:22:30,451 --> 01:22:31,284
the.
I don't think you can make the lead on 

1370
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,433
and I shouldn't say never,
but I don't think that under most 

1371
01:22:36,091 --> 01:22:36,924
circumstances you can make the leap from
childhood to adulthood without this 

1372
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:41,633
intervening inculturation,
which is mostly group foster because 

1373
01:22:45,361 --> 01:22:47,160
it's then that you learn,
for example,

1374
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:48,293
as an adolescent,
that's when you learn how to cope with 

1375
01:22:49,951 --> 01:22:50,784
people in groups and how to and how to 
to act as the responsible member of the 

1376
01:22:54,571 --> 01:22:56,790
culture.
Say once you've got that skill,

1377
01:22:56,791 --> 01:22:58,980
then you can go beyond it,
but if you don't have it,

1378
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:00,173
well it seems to me that that provides a
pretty vicious impediment to your 

1379
01:23:02,851 --> 01:23:05,890
continued progress or do you think think
could you get them at

1380
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:07,930
more or less at the same time?
I mean,

1381
01:23:07,931 --> 01:23:12,931
I'm someone who is not particularly 
socially capable until they,

1382
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:17,180
until they become self capable and I 
think,

1383
01:23:17,181 --> 01:23:18,014
I mean I think most,
most kids go from there go from being 

1384
01:23:20,561 --> 01:23:21,394
children to being members of a group and
then if they're lucky they move beyond 

1385
01:23:24,731 --> 01:23:26,300
that.
But uh,

1386
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,860
what about people who go from go from 
children to being,

1387
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:34,450
to being essentially sort of doing 
nothing and then building,

1388
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,210
doing both at the same time?
I mean because sometimes if you have,

1389
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:40,630
if you have a little enough social 
ability you can,

1390
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:46,140
you can be very
vulnerable or are outcast from the,

1391
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,280
from the sort of group situation but at 
the end.

1392
01:23:50,410 --> 01:23:53,290
But at the same time there are people 
who are in that situation and we'll also

1393
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:58,540
who have a fair amount of self 
competence but,

1394
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,830
but no social competence.
Do you see what I.

1395
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:01,833
well,
I was thinking about about possible 

1396
01:24:03,281 --> 01:24:04,114
exceptions to this.
I guess I would say perhaps that if 

1397
01:24:06,851 --> 01:24:07,684
someone is popped out of the group,
I identification game because they're 

1398
01:24:12,911 --> 01:24:14,800
pursuing an interest that's unique to 
them.

1399
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:16,173
That it's possible that the continued 
development of the interest might lead 

1400
01:24:20,321 --> 01:24:25,321
to to to a proper establishment of an 
adult as an adult,

1401
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:27,063
but I would also say that it's 
inappropriate to presume that group 

1402
01:24:30,371 --> 01:24:31,204
identification necessarily mean 
something that happens at the normal 

1403
01:24:34,571 --> 01:24:36,490
level of adolescent behavior,
which is.

1404
01:24:36,491 --> 01:24:38,710
I'm not saying necessarily that to make 
the gap,

1405
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,080
to make the jump from childhood to 
adulthood,

1406
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:42,063
it's necessarily to associate with a 
gang of peers like in this a sort of 

1407
01:24:46,601 --> 01:24:49,720
classic adolescent mode.
I would also say for example,

1408
01:24:49,721 --> 01:24:50,554
that if you're interested in something 
like say you're really good at the 

1409
01:24:52,091 --> 01:24:54,040
violin,
that might be an example.

1410
01:24:54,041 --> 01:24:54,874
If you have a particular talent,
your peer group then becomes all those 

1411
01:24:58,451 --> 01:24:59,284
people who've had that talent in the 
past who's process of adaptation you're 

1412
01:25:03,491 --> 01:25:04,324
imitating and mimicking to develop your 
skills to move towards the point where 

1413
01:25:08,021 --> 01:25:09,730
you're going to be an individual in your
old.

1414
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:11,410
Right?
So for us,

1415
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:14,390
I mean this is especially true for 
people who are,

1416
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:15,273
who are abstractly capable.
Your peer reference group might be the 

1417
01:25:18,851 --> 01:25:23,050
group that you find in books because 
that's where the group identity has been

1418
01:25:23,051 --> 01:25:25,870
abstracted into ideas.
It doesn't necessarily like,

1419
01:25:25,970 --> 01:25:28,240
especially in a culture as complex as 
ours,

1420
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:29,253
there are peer groups who you can 
identify with at every level of 

1421
01:25:33,341 --> 01:25:34,174
functional analysis.
There are groups that are based purely 

1422
01:25:36,641 --> 01:25:37,474
on a purely on ideas.
There are groups that are based more 

1423
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:44,080
explicitly on shared patterns of 
activity,

1424
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:45,303
so.
But I would still say that to get from 

1425
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:49,330
the point of being a child to the point 
of being an adult,

1426
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:52,480
there has to be this intermediate 
intermediary process.

1427
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:53,314
I think culturation you can choose,
you can pick and choose what that's 

1428
01:25:56,591 --> 01:25:59,340
going to be,
but you need a framework like say,

1429
01:25:59,410 --> 01:25:59,650
so

1430
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:01,060
if you.
If you were operating,

1431
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:03,770
if you're someone who is capable enough 
in something,

1432
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:04,663
the semantic,
the main may never make it back to 

1433
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,410
procedures essentially,
which is.

1434
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:09,823
Well,
I think that would also be a mistake as 

1435
01:26:11,411 --> 01:26:12,250
a general rule,

1436
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,280
but.
Right,

1437
01:26:14,510 --> 01:26:15,870
but it.
But it can happen.

1438
01:26:16,890 --> 01:26:17,820
Yeah,
I think it does.

1439
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:20,840
Well,
what you said about books,

1440
01:26:20,841 --> 01:26:21,674
you have to be a representation of that.
Is that some mean someone who's maybe 

1441
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:26,573
maybe socially uncomfortable,
but I don't really use it reads a great 

1442
01:26:29,521 --> 01:26:32,280
deal when you were saying that they're 
essentially getting

1443
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:33,760
sure.
Sure,

1444
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:35,310
of course they are.
It's just the thing.

1445
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,153
The group they're identifying with his 
speed abstracted into into some maybe 

1446
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:44,390
their peer group may be people who are 
mostly dead who live only in books,

1447
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:46,910
which is not necessarily such a bad peer
reference group.

1448
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:47,983
Depends on your.
Although I would also say that the 

1449
01:26:50,181 --> 01:26:51,014
inability to deal with the living so to 
speak sooner or later is going to 

1450
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:57,380
constitute it is likely going to 
constitute a problem.

1451
01:26:57,460 --> 01:27:01,830
I mean it might not be a fatal error,
but it's still going to be a problem and

1452
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:04,850
even somebody who was as a.
What would you say,

1453
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:05,743
socially isolated as Nietzsche,
especially in the latest part of his 

1454
01:27:07,671 --> 01:27:09,740
life later part of his life.
He still wrote,

1455
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,220
I mean the desire to be part of the 
community.

1456
01:27:13,221 --> 01:27:14,054
It's very paramount even among people 
who are very individualistic and it's 

1457
01:27:16,851 --> 01:27:21,260
also the case that the hero is not the 
person who discovers the goal,

1458
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:24,520
gets the gold from the dragon and then 
wanders off up into the hill.

1459
01:27:25,410 --> 01:27:26,243
The hero is the person who gets the gold
and then it goes back to the community 

1460
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:29,683
so that that presupposes the capacity to
make the knowledge that's been gathered 

1461
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:34,873
on the individual route,
accessible to the community and the 

1462
01:27:37,641 --> 01:27:38,474
skills that allow that to occur.
So it sorta seems different to be 

1463
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:46,160
dealing with the representation of the 
group than with a group itself.

1464
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:47,730
Yeah,
right.

1465
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:50,390
Definitely the whole interaction,
the demands,

1466
01:27:50,391 --> 01:27:51,224
the whole thing seemed to be pretty sure
there's all sorts of other things that 

1467
01:27:53,931 --> 01:27:54,764
come into play when you're actually 
dealing with a person because then it's 

1468
01:27:57,321 --> 01:27:58,154
a two way.
I mean then you have to give back as 

1469
01:27:59,811 --> 01:28:00,644
well as receive,
which seems like a part of what you're 

1470
01:28:02,421 --> 01:28:04,370
describing.
This process of acculturation.

1471
01:28:04,630 --> 01:28:05,361
Right?
Right.

1472
01:28:05,361 --> 01:28:08,280
And there's other things that come into 
play to like sexual tensions and,

1473
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:10,820
and dominance,
hierarchy maneuvering and,

1474
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:11,953
and all sorts of other things that,
that to be part of a community you have 

1475
01:28:15,351 --> 01:28:16,184
to master.

1476
01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:18,560
Yeah.
Um,

1477
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:21,260
I'd always thought of.
Well,

1478
01:28:21,550 --> 01:28:26,550
I think that that's just
the way I see it is.

1479
01:28:27,610 --> 01:28:31,600
Um,
so I've always been,

1480
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:32,503
will be probably a freshman in college.
I always thought that details aren't 

1481
01:28:34,641 --> 01:28:36,770
important,
so like to look at that,

1482
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:41,030
what you're saying as a cake,
I always went for the frosty and instead

1483
01:28:41,031 --> 01:28:46,031
of instead of like the base of the cake 
and I think that it's possible to,

1484
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:49,070
to still add to,
to get a feel for the team.

1485
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:52,010
Um,
but in my experience as an Undergrad,

1486
01:28:52,011 --> 01:28:55,660
I think that,
that knowing the details or,

1487
01:28:55,661 --> 01:28:58,370
or going through this is downward 
process.

1488
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:01,780
Um,
I don't know if it,

1489
01:29:01,781 --> 01:29:04,860
if it makes for a steeper slope,
but it does allow you to get.

1490
01:29:04,861 --> 01:29:05,694
There's this,
there's this level here that you just 

1491
01:29:06,421 --> 01:29:09,180
can't get to without,
without this.

1492
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:10,753
Okay.
So now I want you to tie that more 

1493
01:29:12,261 --> 01:29:14,600
concretely into the discussion that we 
just have.

1494
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:16,020
Okay.
Um,

1495
01:29:16,490 --> 01:29:17,700
with,
with him,

1496
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:18,810
yeah.
Okay.

1497
01:29:18,811 --> 01:29:21,540
So what it seems to me,
what you're saying,

1498
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:22,981
I don't know,
is,

1499
01:29:22,981 --> 01:29:26,490
is possibly that it's,
that you don't understand,

1500
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:27,970
they,
you,

1501
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:29,430
you're getting a feel for the,
for the case,

1502
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,140
for the frosting.
Um,

1503
01:29:31,141 --> 01:29:34,740
and you're saying that maybe you don't 
need to have a group,

1504
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:35,840
um,
to,

1505
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:39,060
to have to grow on this individuality.
You can have a mix on it.

1506
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,730
Um,
but what I take you to be saying is that

1507
01:29:41,731 --> 01:29:43,440
you need to have,
you need to,

1508
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:45,953
you need to know the group fully before 
you can go to the highest level of 

1509
01:29:48,451 --> 01:29:49,000
industry.

1510
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:49,420
Yeah.
Mike,

1511
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:50,253
I guess the way to specify this could be
to say that isn't ignore the county 

1512
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:53,770
fair,
fair enough.

1513
01:29:53,770 --> 01:29:57,420
Fair enough.
I don't want them to think the don't

1514
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:00,693
have the capacity to interact in a group
that's composed of knowledge that's 

1515
01:30:04,301 --> 01:30:05,134
implicit and tacit as well as explicit.
Then if you only go for the explicit 

1516
01:30:08,621 --> 01:30:09,454
knowledge,
then you risk missing the tacit 

1517
01:30:11,711 --> 01:30:14,240
knowledge.
That's the stuff that's been so embodied

1518
01:30:14,290 --> 01:30:17,470
say non verbal behavior,
but people seem to have different levels

1519
01:30:17,471 --> 01:30:21,050
of ability of transforming explicit 
knowledge into tacit knowledge.

1520
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:24,100
I mean different,
different willingness to do that.

1521
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:26,980
Yeah,
I mean the interplay between the,

1522
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:28,123
the memory systems,
the ability to go down the hierarchy as 

1523
01:30:30,851 --> 01:30:31,870
well.
Is that right?

1524
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:33,063
Great.
Well we often don't think down and is 

1525
01:30:34,510 --> 01:30:35,920
necessary.
Right,

1526
01:30:35,921 --> 01:30:39,210
and I think that's because we take the 
attitude that you just described is that

1527
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:43,030
if you know that if you know the words,
you don't have to know the music,

1528
01:30:43,490 --> 01:30:45,520
you don't have to know how to put it 
into action.

1529
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:47,293
I think that's.
I think that's part of the reason that 

1530
01:30:48,411 --> 01:30:51,130
actually by the way that the general 
public in the USA,

1531
01:30:51,131 --> 01:30:51,964
for example,
holds intellectuals in content is 

1532
01:30:54,251 --> 01:30:55,084
because we think the fact is the is the 
knowledge and that's when you can act 

1533
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,313
out the fact you're an idiot.
That's why I like woody Allen movies 

1534
01:31:04,631 --> 01:31:05,464
actually because woody Allen's 
characters are just so stuffed full of 

1535
01:31:08,591 --> 01:31:09,424
facts that it's appalling.
Almost completely useless because they 

1536
01:31:14,321 --> 01:31:17,320
haven't made the transition down the 
hierarchy.

1537
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:19,150
That's right.
That's right.

1538
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,073
Are they confused?
I think what they confuse his knowledge 

1539
01:31:21,671 --> 01:31:22,890
with wisdom,
it's like,

1540
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:23,733
and that's what academics do in general,
what intellectual students we think 

1541
01:31:26,591 --> 01:31:27,424
because we know facts that were smart 
and that's dumb because knowing useless 

1542
01:31:30,551 --> 01:31:31,810
facts,
that's stupid.

1543
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:36,650
Yeah.
What about gender bumps or.

1544
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:37,593
So another question about to what extent
if there's inculturation is like 

1545
01:31:42,221 --> 01:31:43,054
necessarily like,
would you say that in order to be 

1546
01:31:45,550 --> 01:31:46,383
successful artists and do something new,
you would have to understand all our 

1547
01:31:48,630 --> 01:31:49,463
thinking before you or could you like 
sort of working in isolation still do 

1548
01:31:52,571 --> 01:31:52,840
something?

1549
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:53,930
Okay,
well look,

1550
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:54,923
that's a tough question because when 
you're working in isolation you're not 

1551
01:31:57,881 --> 01:32:02,881
working in isolation because like say by
the time you're 20 or 21 or whatever and

1552
01:32:04,001 --> 01:32:05,530
you're working in isolation,
your,

1553
01:32:05,610 --> 01:32:06,443
your head so to speak,
is already stuffed full of your culture 

1554
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,760
and many of the things that you 
discover,

1555
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:13,713
you're actually just remembering like 
it's already the presuppositions that I 

1556
01:32:17,951 --> 01:32:19,210
remember.
Let me give you an example.

1557
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:23,650
The first political science class I took
when I was 17,

1558
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:28,280
I wrote an essay with a friend of mine 
that outline the wheat.

1559
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:31,150
We outline the preconditions for an 
ideal state.

1560
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:32,433
We thought this was very original piece 
of work and we handed this to the 

1561
01:32:34,721 --> 01:32:35,554
professor and the next week we studied 
John Stuart Mill and John Locke and 

1562
01:32:40,090 --> 01:32:40,923
everything we had written down was in 
their writings and I never read John 

1563
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:44,463
Stewart neuro or John Law,
but the point is is that what they said 

1564
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:47,643
400 years ago,
it's so much part of everything that we 

1565
01:32:49,631 --> 01:32:52,090
do that even if you don't know,
you know it.

1566
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:54,250
So then if you start thinking about 
what,

1567
01:32:54,290 --> 01:32:57,940
what constitutes the ideal,
well he ended up doing is recapitulating

1568
01:32:57,941 --> 01:32:59,860
what's already been done.
So.

1569
01:33:00,190 --> 01:33:02,410
So that's,
that's like one answer to your question.

1570
01:33:02,411 --> 01:33:04,360
The other answer is I would say in 
general,

1571
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:10,120
keeping in mind Nietzsche's objections 
that the more you know about what people

1572
01:33:10,121 --> 01:33:10,954
did before you,
the greater your chance of going 

1573
01:33:13,541 --> 01:33:15,370
somewhere that no one has ever done 
before.

1574
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:17,710
Because otherwise you risk reinventing 
the wheel.

1575
01:33:17,770 --> 01:33:20,310
And it really.
And in a way that's inefficient.

1576
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:22,780
Like Einstein,
I think it was Einstein,

1577
01:33:22,781 --> 01:33:23,614
he said,
I can see so far because I stood on the 

1578
01:33:25,691 --> 01:33:29,980
shoulders of giants and that's,
that's a reference to the Einstein was a

1579
01:33:29,981 --> 01:33:30,940
revolutionary,
I mean,

1580
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:32,073
but he still said despite the fact that 
I'm a revolutionary and I undermined my 

1581
01:33:35,441 --> 01:33:36,274
ancestors so to speak,
the only reason I ever got there is 

1582
01:33:38,521 --> 01:33:40,480
because I knew exactly what they do.

1583
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:43,720
I do.
That's the way to go about it.

1584
01:33:45,410 --> 01:33:49,240
One of,
one of the things that seems to be some,

1585
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,153
it's awkward to talk about this because 
we think independence is good and 

1586
01:33:54,850 --> 01:33:55,683
dependency is bad and interdependent 
sort of is some sort of a liminal 

1587
01:33:58,841 --> 01:33:59,860
condition.
I mean,

1588
01:33:59,890 --> 01:34:03,160
we don't quite know what to do with in 
our culture.

1589
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:06,700
It seems to me that some of the unease 
of that,

1590
01:34:06,701 --> 01:34:07,534
this is related to that,
but I actually wanted to ask about 

1591
01:34:09,821 --> 01:34:10,654
gender difference in relation to this 
process we're talking about and whether 

1592
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:16,790
that's significant.
Um,

1593
01:34:17,150 --> 01:34:19,810
I don't.
My guess is that at a,

1594
01:34:20,150 --> 01:34:22,790
at a fundamental level,
I would say probably not.

1595
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:24,733
Whether there's,
where were you thinking about gender 

1596
01:34:27,681 --> 01:34:32,010
differences in relationship to the,
the group connection,

1597
01:34:32,011 --> 01:34:35,780
that group experience and what the group
experience is like an adolescent?

1598
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:36,733
Oh,
I think there are probably gender 

1599
01:34:37,701 --> 01:34:38,900
differences in adolescence.

1600
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:42,900
Partly because women hit puberty like 
two years earlier than men do.

1601
01:34:43,190 --> 01:34:45,710
I think that that makes quite a quite a 
big difference.

1602
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:46,873
So there are groups get fragmented 
earlier about what difference that 

1603
01:34:50,151 --> 01:34:51,020
makes.
I don't know,

1604
01:34:51,170 --> 01:34:54,230
but I would suspect that it's a severe 
enough difference to,

1605
01:34:54,830 --> 01:34:55,663
to,
to have some at least short term 

1606
01:34:58,161 --> 01:35:02,870
implications.
I mean girls hit puberty at 12 or 13,

1607
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:03,763
14 and two years later for boys,
so by the time boys have to deal with 

1608
01:35:07,701 --> 01:35:08,534
all that,
there are two years older and have two 

1609
01:35:10,041 --> 01:35:12,020
years more experience.
Also,

1610
01:35:12,021 --> 01:35:12,854
I think what happens to girls peer 
relationships is that when they hit 

1611
01:35:14,631 --> 01:35:15,464
puberty,
they start associating immediately with 

1612
01:35:16,881 --> 01:35:17,714
older boys two or three years older.
Of course then they're immediately put 

1613
01:35:20,811 --> 01:35:21,644
in a,
at least at temporarily subordinate 

1614
01:35:23,211 --> 01:35:24,044
position and they don't get a chance to 
develop their peer network groups quite 

1615
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:27,673
to the same degree.
Whereas boys have to kind of do that by 

1616
01:35:29,151 --> 01:35:31,160
default,
maybe when they're 13 or whatever,

1617
01:35:31,161 --> 01:35:33,980
they'd rather be associated with girls 
have their own age,

1618
01:35:33,981 --> 01:35:35,390
but the girls will have anything to do 
with them,

1619
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:40,340
so it was like while they're off,
they're off together by default.

1620
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:44,090
I don't know what that means in the 
final analysis.

1621
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:49,610
I'm
thinking subjectively that

1622
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:56,110
making powerful gender differences in 
the entire story all along the line.

1623
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:01,710
Just that could be a topic that might 
come back to it at the end of the.

1624
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:03,613
Yeah.
Well if you have ideas about that that 

1625
01:36:05,410 --> 01:36:06,243
you know,
that would be a really useful topic for 

1626
01:36:07,171 --> 01:36:08,190
an essay,
for example,

1627
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:11,520
if you want to explore that more 
thoroughly because the gender issue is.

1628
01:36:11,970 --> 01:36:14,560
Well first of all there is gender 
problem,

1629
01:36:14,561 --> 01:36:16,920
so to speak.
He looked at classical religious,

1630
01:36:17,100 --> 01:36:17,933
western religious traditions.
There's big gender issues occurring 

1631
01:36:20,341 --> 01:36:21,174
there all the time.
The central figure in Christianity is 

1632
01:36:22,861 --> 01:36:23,694
male and this is.
This is troublesome for even from the 

1633
01:36:26,311 --> 01:36:28,680
perspective of ritual invitation,
it's troublesome.

1634
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:30,960
You also.
It also does seem to me the case,

1635
01:36:30,961 --> 01:36:35,220
they didn't mythology as a general rule,
the figure of the hero is represented as

1636
01:36:35,221 --> 01:36:36,054
masking so and I don't know what that 
means for for it doesn't mean that 

1637
01:36:40,321 --> 01:36:41,160
heroes are map.

1638
01:36:41,610 --> 01:36:45,660
It certainly doesn't mean that in a 
sense it does because you have to ask

1639
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:50,040
to ask about the culture.
Your culture is represented as the great

1640
01:36:50,041 --> 01:36:54,780
father and right to think that we have a
patriarchal culture in the west.

1641
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:56,053
I think we've talked about individual 
stories and there are some very 

1642
01:36:59,491 --> 01:37:00,324
important developmental differences 
between boys and girls that I think 

1643
01:37:02,990 --> 01:37:03,823
we're the last,
maybe in the seventies and eighties we 

1644
01:37:05,941 --> 01:37:06,774
weren't willing to investigate,
but now maybe we are in the field of 

1645
01:37:09,631 --> 01:37:14,310
psychology and one of those is that boys
have to need their mothers girls.

1646
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:15,533
Right?
Right.

1647
01:37:15,650 --> 01:37:20,650
And a lot of the themes of the course in
terms of the terror like your nephew,

1648
01:37:21,810 --> 01:37:22,643
he's terrifying dreams of having to go 
out on its own and here or having to 

1649
01:37:25,771 --> 01:37:26,604
leave and having to kill his mother.
All of these seem to be very tied into 

1650
01:37:30,810 --> 01:37:34,500
this masculine experience of having to 
leave.

1651
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:36,320
One's mother,
for example,

1652
01:37:36,330 --> 01:37:41,330
in a lot of monkey colonies,
the unveils how often it's two girls,

1653
01:37:41,441 --> 01:37:42,900
right?
The girls don't have to leave.

1654
01:37:43,530 --> 01:37:45,600
I think very different developmental 
perspective.

1655
01:37:45,601 --> 01:37:46,960
It doesn't mean it goes to get along 
with them.

1656
01:37:46,990 --> 01:37:49,860
Others,
it just means you never expected to make

1657
01:37:49,861 --> 01:37:51,620
that break.
Boys are.

1658
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:52,553
You never put in that same position and 
I think that it's also the case boy's 

1659
01:37:55,441 --> 01:37:56,040
initiation.

1660
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:56,873
Rituals tend to be much more violent 
than dramatic than those girls and I 

1661
01:37:59,911 --> 01:38:00,744
think you've said,
I think it is very much for this reason 

1662
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:03,203
because there a break that there's a 
more severe break that necessarily has 

1663
01:38:06,211 --> 01:38:07,044
to be made or this has.
This has really profound implications 

1664
01:38:09,721 --> 01:38:12,870
for the constructions of ideals too 
because it seems to me,

1665
01:38:13,050 --> 01:38:15,030
this is my own personal opinion of 
course,

1666
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:17,520
but it seems to me that the feminist 
movement,

1667
01:38:17,521 --> 01:38:21,150
especially in the sixties and seventies,
miss the boat in some regards,

1668
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:22,013
bike presuming that the male pattern of 
development and construction of the 

1669
01:38:26,341 --> 01:38:27,174
patriarchal society necessarily 
constituted an ideal form of behavior 

1670
01:38:31,410 --> 01:38:33,360
and one that women would do well to 
emulate.

1671
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:36,060
I mean,
you can say that separately from saying

1672
01:38:36,430 --> 01:38:37,263
from,
from.

1673
01:38:38,630 --> 01:38:41,110
You can say that separately.
Well,

1674
01:38:42,290 --> 01:38:45,920
I'm not so sure about that.
Well,

1675
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:46,793
okay.
I mean this,

1676
01:38:46,890 --> 01:38:48,330
this is an issue obviously,
that there's,

1677
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:52,110
there's all sorts of area for debate,
but that's my general impression.

1678
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:56,640
So anyways,
it's just an absolutely useful,

1679
01:38:56,740 --> 01:38:59,040
useful topic and I don't know how to 
address it from.

1680
01:38:59,330 --> 01:39:03,090
One of the things that's interesting 
with regards to this though is that it's

1681
01:39:03,091 --> 01:39:06,010
not so much the case in this class,
but most of us students

1682
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:11,580
were women and the appeal of his writing
has generally been to women.

1683
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:13,860
No,
I don't.

1684
01:39:13,870 --> 01:39:18,190
Why that is exactly.
I think that's more here relates to

1685
01:39:20,590 --> 01:39:21,423
extract information and I think that has
to do a lot with like the historical 

1686
01:39:24,551 --> 01:39:25,384
moment.
I think that women and men experienced 

1687
01:39:27,261 --> 01:39:28,094
our historical moment,
adolescent funimation identity in such 

1688
01:39:31,391 --> 01:39:32,224
different ways.
Like due to a large project managers 

1689
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:35,553
yanked away from their mothers,
his boys and then they have to go 

1690
01:39:37,751 --> 01:39:38,940
through this initiatory.
Right?

1691
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:42,560
And then they see women no longer his 
mother but his mate,

1692
01:39:42,940 --> 01:39:45,200
you know,
for reproduction to Marin and perpetuate

1693
01:39:45,201 --> 01:39:50,201
society or whatever.
So the point being is that not only j,

1694
01:39:51,190 --> 01:39:55,480
they have very different experiences so 
that like the feminist movement,

1695
01:39:55,481 --> 01:39:56,314
you know,
you can't parallelize the woman's 

1696
01:39:58,091 --> 01:40:02,350
experience to a man's experience so that
like the way young interprets,

1697
01:40:02,351 --> 01:40:04,090
you know,
life is just,

1698
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:08,030
it's more effective to a woman because,
you know,

1699
01:40:08,031 --> 01:40:08,864
he deals with women are socialized in 
much different ways that you can deal 

1700
01:40:11,940 --> 01:40:16,300
with issues relating much more to a 
women as a woman does,

1701
01:40:16,301 --> 01:40:18,130
where history is like,
you know,

1702
01:40:18,460 --> 01:40:20,920
historically dominated by men and man 
creates history.

1703
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:21,753
So what do you think it is about his 
writings and make making in particular 

1704
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:26,080
more attractive to women?
I mean,

1705
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:27,263
they're,
I mean,

1706
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:30,850
they're so interesting to me.
They're just fascinating because I think

1707
01:40:30,851 --> 01:40:33,180
it's just because it's more,
um,

1708
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:35,080
I don't know,
maybe you know,

1709
01:40:35,170 --> 01:40:37,300
you're sold or you know,
it's just,

1710
01:40:37,330 --> 01:40:40,630
it's not really something you can 
articulate very well.

1711
01:40:40,631 --> 01:40:41,464
But,
um,

1712
01:40:41,830 --> 01:40:44,240
I guess just his references to um,

1713
01:40:44,890 --> 01:40:45,290
well,
you,

1714
01:40:45,290 --> 01:40:46,123
you believe that you don't believe that 
the idea of thinking of how things were 

1715
01:40:50,921 --> 01:40:51,754
connected was more intrinsically 
attracted women than the idea of things 

1716
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:55,593
of how things are different.
And the masculine consciousness has a 

1717
01:40:58,001 --> 01:41:02,470
discriminative quality which cuts things
into pieces and I think that might be.

1718
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:03,453
I think that might because males are 
more bilaterally split in there 

1719
01:41:06,091 --> 01:41:07,240
hemisphere as well.
I mean,

1720
01:41:07,290 --> 01:41:08,123
I don't know.
I don't know that the idea that that 

1721
01:41:09,431 --> 01:41:11,170
represents.
I mean I know that that's not,

1722
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:13,480
that's somewhat speculative in terms of 
physiology,

1723
01:41:13,481 --> 01:41:14,314
but the,
the idea of the strength of the 

1724
01:41:16,331 --> 01:41:18,310
masculine identity with the semantic 
system.

1725
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:20,620
Well that's a,
that's a possibility.

1726
01:41:20,621 --> 01:41:21,454
I mean,
if I was going to speculate in their 

1727
01:41:22,100 --> 01:41:22,933
direction,
that's probably the path down which I 

1728
01:41:24,671 --> 01:41:25,820
would go.
So

1729
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:29,420
what's that?
Smaller?

1730
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:32,190
Yeah,
I think that's.

1731
01:41:32,290 --> 01:41:33,790
I think that's the case.
Okay.

1732
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:34,733
One other thing,
I just wanna I to pop some ideas out 

1733
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:38,133
with relationship to this before we 
close out the class because I really 

1734
01:41:40,781 --> 01:41:42,910
want you to think about this because 
this is important.

1735
01:41:43,510 --> 01:41:45,880
Um,
look,

1736
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:47,650
you know,
if you're,

1737
01:41:47,770 --> 01:41:51,880
if you're searching for information 
about how to behave well,

1738
01:41:51,881 --> 01:41:52,714
that's a search for wisdom.
And the question that sort of underlies 

1739
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:58,360
the search for wisdom is an internal 
philosophical question.

1740
01:41:58,690 --> 01:41:59,523
Then the question is what is the good.
And I try to make something of this and 

1741
01:42:02,711 --> 01:42:03,544
this manuscript because I think that 
posing the question in that way has 

1742
01:42:05,741 --> 01:42:06,574
caused us a lot of trouble.
Now I would say that like if you're 

1743
01:42:09,761 --> 01:42:10,451
here,
okay,

1744
01:42:10,451 --> 01:42:11,284
so mom's gone,
you know you're not a child anymore and 

1745
01:42:13,361 --> 01:42:15,180
you can't,
she can't solve your problems anymore.

1746
01:42:15,190 --> 01:42:17,560
And that has,
that's just the way it is.

1747
01:42:17,561 --> 01:42:18,394
You're too big.
So then you're here in this chaotic 

1748
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:22,713
intermediary position and someone comes 
along and this is what initiation 

1749
01:42:26,201 --> 01:42:27,034
rituals do.

1750
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:28,013
They tear the boys and the women all cry
because the boys are gone and when they 

1751
01:42:31,361 --> 01:42:33,190
come back they're going to be again.
And that's the truth.

1752
01:42:33,191 --> 01:42:34,710
So when they acquitted,
they cried,

1753
01:42:34,810 --> 01:42:35,643
they made it.
The boys are taken out away from their 

1754
01:42:37,511 --> 01:42:39,280
mother and they're terrified half to 
death,

1755
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:41,350
which is basically what happens to 
marines.

1756
01:42:41,351 --> 01:42:44,180
We need to put through bootcamp.
And then for precisely the same raises,

1757
01:42:44,190 --> 01:42:46,750
it's like you're no longer child will 
put you through the ringer.

1758
01:42:46,930 --> 01:42:48,000
Your old identities.
No,

1759
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:49,113
it has to be killed.
We'll kill it because it's better than 

1760
01:42:51,041 --> 01:42:55,340
it dies now than that.
It hangs around with 20 years torturing,

1761
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:56,253
which is what it would do otherwise,
so we'll just scare the hell out of you 

1762
01:42:58,780 --> 01:42:59,613
and put you in a very suggestible state 
and what would have suggested estate 

1763
01:43:02,630 --> 01:43:03,071
paid?
Well,

1764
01:43:03,071 --> 01:43:03,904
I would say I'm going to strip away all 
your past beliefs and put you in a 

1765
01:43:06,611 --> 01:43:07,444
situation you've never been in before,
which is to say you've always been 

1766
01:43:09,551 --> 01:43:12,700
afraid of the dark,
but mom was always there,

1767
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:14,073
so now I'm going to do is find the 
darkest and most frightening place that 

1768
01:43:16,571 --> 01:43:19,340
I can possibly imagine and I'm going to 
put you in it,

1769
01:43:19,780 --> 01:43:22,060
and that's what people do and initiation
ceremonies.

1770
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:23,170
It's like,
here's a.

1771
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:25,240
here's a case.
You don't know what the hell is in it.

1772
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:26,830
Maybe there's a monster.
In fact,

1773
01:43:26,831 --> 01:43:31,330
there is one that your imagination is 
put there and it's the worst monster you

1774
01:43:31,331 --> 01:43:33,370
can think of.
That's where you're going,

1775
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:37,510
so we're going to put you in there till 
till you discover that although you feel

1776
01:43:37,511 --> 01:43:39,430
that you're going to go crazy,
you won't.

1777
01:43:40,630 --> 01:43:41,463
That's your heightened state of 
suggestibility is I'm in a place where 

1778
01:43:44,891 --> 01:43:47,920
nothing makes sense and put me because 
I've never felt this before.

1779
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:50,140
What do I want?
I want an answer.

1780
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,650
Well,
that's when inculturation of course,

1781
01:43:52,651 --> 01:43:56,330
it's like you're no longer a child.
Here's the mysteries of the tribe.

1782
01:43:57,140 --> 01:43:59,620
That's your new story.
That's brainwashing.

1783
01:44:00,010 --> 01:44:00,843
We proceeded so you're all chaotic.
You want me to story including one that 

1784
01:44:03,681 --> 01:44:05,540
will cover everything that you just 
experienced.

1785
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:08,060
Someone comes along and hands it to you 
on a silver plate.

1786
01:44:08,450 --> 01:44:10,550
You take it in,
that's your inculturation.

1787
01:44:10,551 --> 01:44:13,400
So now you're an adult and your standard
bear of the community.

1788
01:44:13,730 --> 01:44:14,570
So you could say,
well,

1789
01:44:14,571 --> 01:44:19,571
the question here is being a child is no
longer an answer to your problem.

1790
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:20,653
So the next problem is what is the good?
And that's conceived of as a concrete 

1791
01:44:26,530 --> 01:44:30,640
question and their answer is our 
culture.

1792
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:34,220
So that's where the human being Smith 
and many cultures,

1793
01:44:35,690 --> 01:44:36,523
the word many cultures used for the 
members of that culture is the word 

1794
01:44:39,381 --> 01:44:40,214
that's the equivalent to human,
which is that if you're from this 

1795
01:44:42,321 --> 01:44:43,340
culture,
you're human.

1796
01:44:43,580 --> 01:44:46,670
If you're from another culture,
but whatever you are isn't human.

1797
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:48,170
For me,
it's something that's sort of looks like

1798
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:49,293
but partakes more of the domain of 
novelty than of the domain of the 

1799
01:44:52,611 --> 01:44:53,930
encountered.
So

1800
01:44:56,350 --> 01:44:59,990
given culture is a specific answer to 
the general question.

1801
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:01,033
What is the good,
and it's the question that's answered 

1802
01:45:03,081 --> 01:45:05,570
when you make the transition from 
childhood to adolescence.

1803
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:10,160
We know that,
that an answer to the question,

1804
01:45:10,161 --> 01:45:12,410
what is the goodest troublesome say in 
the Old Testament,

1805
01:45:12,411 --> 01:45:13,244
for example,
it says,

1806
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:15,590
shouldn't make an idol out of God.
That's right.

1807
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:17,660
No graven images.
And why is that?

1808
01:45:17,930 --> 01:45:18,763
Because you shouldn't confuse the 
abstract thing with the concrete thing 

1809
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:23,840
and the problem with the question,
what is the good,

1810
01:45:23,841 --> 01:45:24,674
which is a question that western 
philosophy is being trained to address 

1811
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:28,363
4,000 years,
is that it presumes that there is an 

1812
01:45:30,171 --> 01:45:31,004
answer to a question like that,
which is to say that in the way the 

1813
01:45:33,771 --> 01:45:34,604
question is phrased,
there's an implicit presumption that it 

1814
01:45:37,551 --> 01:45:38,384
can be answered in that form and I would
say that when you adopt a group 

1815
01:45:41,901 --> 01:45:44,660
identity,
that's what you've answered,

1816
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:45,913
but there is a better question and it's 
the question that you answered when you 

1817
01:45:48,651 --> 01:45:50,420
make it to the next step.
So you say,

1818
01:45:50,421 --> 01:45:53,270
well,
chaos group identification,

1819
01:45:53,450 --> 01:45:54,560
Bang,
that's your solution.

1820
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:55,970
What is the good?
Well,

1821
01:45:55,971 --> 01:45:57,650
here's a whole bunch of rules,
right?

1822
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:58,633
Those are concrete representations of 
how you should behave and what 

1823
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:03,680
constitutes good and evil from a 
particular perspective,

1824
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:07,280
but then there's another question that 
might rear its ugly head later,

1825
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:10,790
which is a much more profound question 
and that is the question.

1826
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:16,490
What is the nature of the process?
By which answers to the question,

1827
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:19,840
what is the good are formulated,
right?

1828
01:46:20,150 --> 01:46:20,983
It's a medical question,
it says not what's the answer to the 

1829
01:46:23,661 --> 01:46:24,494
question,
but what's the nature of the procedure 

1830
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,033
that you engage in when you're answering
the questions which you really have to 

1831
01:46:31,011 --> 01:46:31,844
know because the question what is the 
good shifts with environmental 

1832
01:46:34,371 --> 01:46:37,070
circumstance,
which is to say that what's good for you

1833
01:46:37,071 --> 01:46:37,904
one day is not necessarily good for you 
the next day or what's good for your 

1834
01:46:40,041 --> 01:46:43,040
culture now like do it in 100 years.

1835
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:47,090
So if you answered the question,
what is the good with an answer,

1836
01:46:47,510 --> 01:46:48,343
then you've already made an error 
because the answer presupposes that 

1837
01:46:51,931 --> 01:46:55,200
there isn't permanent answer to that 
question and that's wrong.

1838
01:46:55,590 --> 01:46:56,423
So I would say
when you get to this level of the whole 

1839
01:46:59,820 --> 01:47:00,653
system,
which is the next stage beyond your 

1840
01:47:02,281 --> 01:47:05,010
cultural identification,
what you're looking for,

1841
01:47:05,610 --> 01:47:10,610
is it a description of the process that 
leads you to be able to answer questions

1842
01:47:11,310 --> 01:47:12,143
of the sort?
What is when you have to update them 

1843
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:15,533
constantly.
And so I would say that why do you 

1844
01:47:16,801 --> 01:47:17,634
identify with when you moved to here is 
the process by which these structures 

1845
01:47:23,311 --> 01:47:24,144
are actually January.
So it's the process that you read 

1846
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:27,143
stories itself and that that gives you 
all the wisdom that you already have as 

1847
01:47:31,951 --> 01:47:32,784
a consequence of your cultural 
identification with the additional 

1848
01:47:35,371 --> 01:47:39,320
knowledge that you're also the one that 
builds the stories.

1849
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:42,610
That's where your central point of 
identification can be.

1850
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:44,710
So then if you say you're involved in,
in,

1851
01:47:44,711 --> 01:47:45,181
in,
in,

1852
01:47:45,181 --> 01:47:45,720
in,
in,

1853
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:46,553
in,
in settling a dispute between people 

1854
01:47:48,871 --> 01:47:51,600
from two different cultural positions.
And the thing is,

1855
01:47:51,601 --> 01:47:52,434
you know,
you know that person a and person b are 

1856
01:47:54,841 --> 01:47:55,674
both exemplary
representatives of their particular 

1857
01:47:59,941 --> 01:48:01,980
culture,
but they're at odds with one another.

1858
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:03,720
So then the question then is,
well,

1859
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:07,110
what constitutes common ground?
Because you need a position.

1860
01:48:07,170 --> 01:48:09,310
Remember we were asking and wondering 
what's the,

1861
01:48:09,690 --> 01:48:11,790
what's the issue?
Here's one story.

1862
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:12,773
Here's another.
They're not the same as a consequence 

1863
01:48:17,010 --> 01:48:17,843
like traveling is breaking out.
Well we don't know what going to 

1864
01:48:21,051 --> 01:48:24,060
maneuver over here where there are no 
rules.

1865
01:48:25,230 --> 01:48:28,020
It's great because neither side excepts 
the rules on the other side.

1866
01:48:28,021 --> 01:48:29,190
So then the question is,
well,

1867
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:30,353
what are the rules that allow you to 
maneuver when you're outside the place 

1868
01:48:32,641 --> 01:48:33,600
that there are rules?

1869
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:34,351
And I would say,
well,

1870
01:48:34,351 --> 01:48:35,184
I would hope that I could appeal to you 
on a general basis and as someone who's 

1871
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:43,320
not only an exemplar of the culture as 
specified territory,

1872
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:44,513
but an exemplar of those members of the 
culture who had enough courage to 

1873
01:48:47,851 --> 01:48:48,684
construct the culture to begin with,
and that's the place where we hope to 

1874
01:48:51,601 --> 01:48:54,660
operate.
And then I would also hope to be able to

1875
01:48:54,661 --> 01:48:58,110
say to you that your culture differs 
from my culture,

1876
01:48:58,140 --> 01:48:58,973
but were there the same is that they 
were both directed by people who had 

1877
01:49:02,461 --> 01:49:03,294
enough courage to erect.
And so if you really want to identify 

1878
01:49:06,601 --> 01:49:09,750
with your culture,
then you stop identifying with the rules

1879
01:49:10,230 --> 01:49:11,063
and you start identifying with the 
process and also to the degree that you 

1880
01:49:14,341 --> 01:49:15,174
want me to identify with the rules,
you stop yourself from identifying with 

1881
01:49:18,301 --> 01:49:19,134
the process.
Most people are not those courageous 

1882
01:49:21,901 --> 01:49:22,734
people.

1883
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:24,063
Well,
I think partly it's a problem of 

1884
01:49:26,521 --> 01:49:31,521
conceptualization is that until you can 
perceive the possibility.

1885
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:34,500
Look,
if you want to stop kids,

1886
01:49:34,501 --> 01:49:35,370
for example,
from,

1887
01:49:35,371 --> 01:49:36,204
uh,
from forming gangs and from proceeding 

1888
01:49:38,701 --> 01:49:39,534
morally within the game.
But immorally with regards to the rest 

1889
01:49:41,821 --> 01:49:44,280
of the world,
I don't think that saying to them,

1890
01:49:44,281 --> 01:49:45,114
well,
the way that you construct your game is 

1891
01:49:46,351 --> 01:49:48,250
inappropriate.
It's going to work because they need the

1892
01:49:48,251 --> 01:49:49,084
gangs,
but what you might be able to say as 

1893
01:49:50,590 --> 01:49:51,423
well what you think you,
you think what you're doing is the most 

1894
01:49:53,801 --> 01:49:57,160
courageous thing that can be done 
because a lot of gang activity,

1895
01:49:57,161 --> 01:49:58,390
for example,
is quite dangerous.

1896
01:49:58,990 --> 01:49:59,890
But then you say,
well,

1897
01:49:59,891 --> 01:50:02,860
it's not his.
There's a whole other realm of courage.

1898
01:50:03,010 --> 01:50:05,020
It's outside of the domain that you've 
considered.

1899
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:07,960
It's much more difficult and if you are 
a real human being,

1900
01:50:07,961 --> 01:50:09,940
so to speak,
that's what you do.

1901
01:50:10,510 --> 01:50:13,600
Because if you want to offer someone an 
option and have them take it,

1902
01:50:13,690 --> 01:50:16,090
I think you have to offer them something
that's more difficult.

1903
01:50:16,930 --> 01:50:19,270
The moral equivalent board or if that's 
right,

1904
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:21,630
that's the moral equivalent of war.
Yeah,

1905
01:50:22,210 --> 01:50:24,250
absolutely.
But the problem is something that's just

1906
01:50:24,251 --> 01:50:29,251
as excited and just as dangerous.
But where did the territory's different?

1907
01:50:30,870 --> 01:50:31,703
The problem is worried something 
procedural and therefore it's easy to 

1908
01:50:33,311 --> 01:50:34,144
grasp as an alternative.
Whereas this is something that's 

1909
01:50:35,361 --> 01:50:36,194
correct.
