1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,720
Hello and welcome to this special 
edition of under the skin with me 

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,310
Russell brand.
I'll be talking to doctor professor Dr 

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,090
Jordan Peterson.
I've spoken to him before,

4
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:15,720
but this special commemorative was not 
really a commemorative chat.

5
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:20,430
It's not a tea towel for the royal 
wedding between Meghan Markle and Prince

6
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:24,300
Harry.
It's a to celebrate the release on paper

7
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:27,510
back of my book recovery.
And look at it now on Amazon.

8
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:30,210
It's six pound 50,
I think might be six pound,

9
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:32,640
47.
We talk about that book recovery.

10
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:35,760
We talked about the principles of 
recovery is a road to enlightenment.

11
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:40,761
We talk about Dr Peterson's book.
12 rules for life is an interesting 

12
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:41,460
chat.
Talking about myth.

13
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:45,500
We do of course go through some of the 
main stays of Professor Peterson's,

14
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:50,710
uh,
a water cannon of ideas that you 

15
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:54,270
commonly talked about.
But also I think we really get to the 

16
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:54,510
heart of it and discover some.
Uh,

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,720
some people think there is an exclusion 
of warmth that I think sometimes when 

18
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,741
talking about and his ideas and he's 
insistent on individual culpability and 

19
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:07,770
responsibility,
we get into that stuff quite deeply.

20
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,850
I think it's a great chat.
Those you don't know who Jordan Peterson

21
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:12,480
is yet.
We're.

22
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,740
Have you been obviously not watching him
at the Hammersmith Apollo with 5,000

23
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:19,260
others,
so yeah,

24
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,980
we're talking to Jordan Peterson.
I'm amber skin.

25
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,190
Thanks for joining me and do check out 
my book recovery on paperback.

26
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:26,730
Thank you

27
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,790
Dr Jordan Peterson.
Thank you for coming on under the skin.

28
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,860
It's lovely to see you again.
It's good to see you too.

29
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:35,320
It's nice to meet in London.
It's different,

30
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:40,321
isn't it?
We're both of us were exiled in Los 

31
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:42,340
Angeles in our last conversation,
but I enjoyed it very much.

32
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:45,280
I've got a lot from it.
I'm happy to talk to you on.

33
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,110
This is very much home turf for me.
Now.

34
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,620
We're in London.
We're in a publishing office.

35
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,240
You've been promoting your book 
opportunity.

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,130
That's why you're here.
A couple of public lectures.

37
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:02,730
How do you find that now?
How do you finding what I thought in a 

38
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,430
way I've been comparing you to the 
British opposition leader,

39
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:08,431
Jeremy Corbyn in that you've been doing 
this for ages and now you're 

40
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:09,890
experiencing a,
uh,

41
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:14,680
an almost perhaps unprecedented level of
attention,

42
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,790
but I'm assuming that your skill set is 
applicable.

43
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,760
You're a lecturer,
you're a clinical psycho analyst,

44
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,250
so it's not like,
oh my God,

45
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:25,610
there's cameras.
Right,

46
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,320
right.
Well,

47
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,370
I mean the,
the,

48
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,430
the large scale lectures aren't doing,
aren't that much different in kind from 

49
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,370
the lectures I was doing at the 
university.

50
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,420
I mean the venues are larger and.
Yeah.

51
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,040
But the Hammersmith Apollo 3000 seats,
I think maybe there were.

52
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,540
Yeah,
there were 5,000

53
00:02:40,541 --> 00:02:41,590
at the Apollo.
Well,

54
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:46,591
that's where you're not nervous.
I'm not as nervous doing that as I am 

55
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:51,481
often going to talk to journalists,
individual journalists because like the 

56
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:56,041
thing about those venues,
there's a variety of things about them 

57
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:56,041
that work in my favor.
I mean,

58
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,310
I like talking to crowds,
you know,

59
00:02:57,311 --> 00:03:02,311
I've always enjoyed lecturing and so 
lecturing to several thousand people 

60
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:05,020
isn't much different than lecturing to 
several hundred people.

61
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,520
But I also know that the people who've 
come are there happy to be there,

62
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,480
like I'm,
I'm,

63
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,570
I'm speaking to a welcoming crowd and 
so,

64
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:16,150
and it's all,
all of the details are essentially under

65
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:16,960
my control.

66
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,480
So.
So it's not,

67
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,270
it,
it,

68
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:26,070
I'm actually enjoying it quite a bit.
I mean I'm apprehensive beforehand 

69
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,070
because,
well,

70
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,040
because you should be,
you know,

71
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:32,130
I want to do a good job and I want to 
make sure things go well and I want to 

72
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:32,830
get through the material properly and,
and,

73
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,550
and get a little farther in my thinking 
than I have been in and I'm trying to 

74
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,560
make each time I lecture better than the
last time and I don't obviously,

75
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:44,260
I always don't succeed at that.
But.

76
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,330
But it's good.
I'm enjoying it.

77
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:48,370
And my wife is very good travel 
companion.

78
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:53,371
She's very stable and she helps me plan 
my days and so we've got it down to a 

79
00:03:53,371 --> 00:03:57,571
bit of a routine.
I would say Tammy is in the room with 

80
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,901
us.
We have already met previously in Los 

81
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:00,901
Angeles.
You wouldn't be on my,

82
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:05,490
there isn't my,
it's just in case listeners are 

83
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,310
wondering why perhaps they might be able
to detect my voice.

84
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,800
I'm occasionally glancing towards the 
spouse.

85
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,420
The reason is because I am now.
Well,

86
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,080
I'm curious,
when you're doing these lectures,

87
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,980
is there not a performance component?
Do you not feel?

88
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,160
Definitely,
yeah.

89
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,560
Well sure.
I mean a lecture theater is a theater.

90
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,700
You and,
and lecture is a form of theater now.

91
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:30,520
It's a serious form of theater,
but theater can be serious.

92
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,930
No one and there's a seat because partly
what I'm doing is I'm presenting ideas 

93
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:41,370
to an audience,
but I'm also modeling the act of 

94
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,050
engaging with ideas and that's the 
theatrical at end of it and I don't give

95
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,080
the same talk twice.
Like I have my stories and I have my 

96
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,110
collection of things I know and I talk 
about,

97
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:53,170
but I try to.
I try to do two things.

98
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,010
I try to.
I'm always talking to specific 

99
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,341
individuals in the audience and so I'm 
having a conversation with the audience 

100
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:06,451
and so that's,
that's part of the dynamic element of 

101
00:05:06,451 --> 00:05:06,451
the performance.

102
00:05:06,451 --> 00:05:10,080
And the other thing I'm trying to do is 
to further my thinking on the topics 

103
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,860
that I'm addressing and there is a 
theatrical element to that because it's,

104
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,010
it's like,
I think the closest thing really that it

105
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:20,011
compares to is probably stand up comedy,
although I think the routines that 

106
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:24,901
comedians have are probably more well 
and formally practiced than the ones 

107
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:24,901
that,
that,

108
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,540
you know,
than,

109
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,340
than the,
than the talks that I,

110
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,850
that I engage in.
I don't really think of it as delivering

111
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:35,851
a lecture to an audience.
I'm trying to think about complicated 

112
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:39,661
things in real time with an audience 
there to participate and to use the 

113
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:45,001
audience as an indicator of whether what
I'm saying is gripping and 

114
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:47,800
comprehensible you apprehension and,
and,

115
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,040
uh,
understandable Adrenalin prior to going 

116
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,470
on stage doesn't lead you to lean into 
stick in it,

117
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,220
which would be the opposite of what 
you're describing.

118
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,310
One,
to remain

119
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,690
engaged in a kind of dialectic process 
of discovery.

120
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,700
Because I thought,
I mean obviously I am a comedian.

121
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:06,650
So like for,
for us,

122
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:11,651
I would argue there is a,
there is a distinction between 

123
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:12,560
performing for before 200 people or 
5,000

124
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:16,340
people around 200.
I feel like I'm very relaxed,

125
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:21,341
I'm comfortable.
I feel like I've got a lot of space in 

126
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:21,341
there.
A $5,000

127
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:26,040
like sharpen up.
Now you've got no room particularly 

128
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,840
because the other crucial difference is 
there needs to be a laugh every 20,

129
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,190
30 seconds.
If there isn't,

130
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,370
it gets pretty frosty up.
There is,

131
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:38,390
it is appealing to me as a comedian 
that's interested in interested in 

132
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,480
furthering intellectual debate,
looking at the new intersections between

133
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,490
politics and spirituality.
Perhaps they've always been there.

134
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,790
These are some,
these evaporating context.

135
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,820
The emergence of new ideas perhaps 
perhaps best exemplified by your own 

136
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,511
particular trajectory is interesting to 
me that that these spaces are now 

137
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:03,671
becoming available for forms of types of
performance that aren't so contingent.

138
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,830
It is on rapture and planner.

139
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,320
Right?
I know it is a very strange thing and 

140
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:11,320
I'm not sure what to make of it.
You know,

141
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,140
you see Sam Harris doing something quite
similar.

142
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,990
Richard Dawkins is doing something quite
similar and,

143
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,970
and it's,
it's,

144
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,840
I mean I was thinking because I've been 
trying to conceptualize this and,

145
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:27,140
and one one comparable audience or one 
comparable situation is probably that 

146
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,290
of,
of standup comedians.

147
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Another I suspect are traveling 
evangelists eventually it evangelical 

148
00:07:34,051 --> 00:07:34,960
type.
Yeah.

149
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:35,980
No,
because there.

150
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,910
But of course what they're doing is 
explicitly religious.

151
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,480
This is this,
this has elements of both of those.

152
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:47,481
And what's emerging that's so 
interesting is that there's a clear 

153
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:51,171
public appetite for high level 
intellectual conversation.

154
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,540
If it's,
if it's dynamic and I don't know what,

155
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,900
what's accounting for that,
all of a sudden maybe it's because these

156
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:02,901
sorts of discussions aren't taking place
like they should in the classical media 

157
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,050
space.

158
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,040
You might be right there.
Jordan,

159
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,460
I mean to slightly mangle to slightly 
mangled the young quote that you use in 

160
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,690
your book.
I'm 12 rules.

161
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,070
I'm really enjoying actually,
uh,

162
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,200
like the one could infer motivation from
results perhaps is that the political 

163
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:28,741
discourse,
social discourse has become superficial 

164
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,730
and detached from meaning from purpose,
from experience.

165
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,910
That there is an opening appetite for 
substance that people are starting to.

166
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,050
What you know,
and,

167
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,860
and,
and as you said about theater before,

168
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:44,130
you know,
the origins of theater and the origins 

169
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,851
of religion are closely connected and 
both of them still our debt or at least 

170
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,420
functionally must relate to meaning 
purpose,

171
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,950
giving us stories that help illuminate

172
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,950
the path.
I think that.

173
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,310
I think that's,
that's,

174
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,130
that's there's something about that 
that's profoundly correct.

175
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:07,131
I think that know that the New York 
Times has recently written about the 

176
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:08,580
rise of the so called intellectual dark 
web,

177
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:12,210
which is a term that Eric Weinstein so 
brilliantly coined,

178
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:12,870
I would say.
And,

179
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,820
and very thoughtfully.
Um,

180
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,630
I think that the thing that unites the 
people who are loosely grouped into that

181
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:25,701
collection is that they are having 
serious conversations with an audience 

182
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:29,220
that they respect and they're very 
diverse range of people.

183
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:34,221
They don't certainly don't like salmon.
Sam Harris and I disagree about many 

184
00:09:34,221 --> 00:09:35,280
things for example,
and uh,

185
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,490
but Sam respects his audiences and he's,
and he's engaging them in extremely 

186
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:45,651
serious discourse about very deep topics
now about the structure of reality 

187
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,910
actually and,
and the relationship between science and

188
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:49,710
religion and,
and,

189
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,580
and the.
And I think it is a consequence of the 

190
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:55,580
fact that not only has our public 
discourse,

191
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,690
let's say in the media and in politics 
become shallow.

192
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,140
I think it's become unbearably shallow 
in the universities.

193
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,060
So yeah,
well,

194
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,120
because it's become so ideological,
you know,

195
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:07,980
and it's just not helpful.
Look,

196
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:10,700
I was interviewed by a New York Times 
journalist last week.

197
00:10:10,701 --> 00:10:15,701
A Nelly was her name and she's going to 
publish this on Sunday and she did a 

198
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:20,481
literature degree at Columbia and she 
told me that she was quite appalled 

199
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:22,440
actually by her degree,
uh,

200
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,650
especially in,
in,

201
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,730
in hindsight,
she told me that she didn't know until 

202
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,060
she graduated,
that there was any other way of reading 

203
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,670
great literature than through a 
postmodern lense.

204
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:37,050
And the postmodern lens takes a book and
basically you take a book,

205
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:42,000
whatever it happens to be,
and you decide which power hierarchy the

206
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:47,001
author was serving and who is he,
who he or she has excluded from 

207
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:51,201
consideration.
So it's completely read through a 

208
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:53,481
political lens as if the book is nothing
but a tool of political and economic 

209
00:10:53,481 --> 00:10:54,600
domination essentially.

210
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,140
And that's the assumption.
And like,

211
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:01,460
look,
everything's contaminated by politics 

212
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:01,460
and power to some degree,
right?

213
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:06,590
But that doesn't mean that there's 
nothing to art and literature except in 

214
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,880
service of,
of like group domination.

215
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,950
It's an appalling way of looking at the 
world.

216
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,090
It would be an extraordinary bias to 
bring to Jane.

217
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,300
Eyre is difficult to sort of make sense 
of it through that Lens.

218
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:19,980
Then of course in economics and 
politics,

219
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:20,680
like,
yeah,

220
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,630
of course important themes are going to 
be present in great works of art,

221
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:25,710
but uh,
I,

222
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,140
I'm interest.
They're still great works of art.

223
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,760
That's the thing.
And it's like,

224
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,310
well,
even even with something as transient as

225
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:37,311
comedy,
let's say mean you can't reduce comedy 

226
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:37,940
to the political or the economic and,
and,

227
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,130
and,
and comics who become too ideological,

228
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,280
let's say,
like musicians who become too 

229
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,280
ideological.
They're just not funny anymore.

230
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,000
You have to be,
I mean,

231
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:50,010
you can have your viewpoint left or 
right,

232
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:55,011
that's fine and people do,
but you have to be able to transcend 

233
00:11:55,011 --> 00:11:58,501
that viewpoint continually and you have 
to be able to criticize it because 

234
00:11:58,501 --> 00:11:59,860
otherwise you're not a music.
You just become a demagogue of sorts.

235
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,310
Yes.
I would agree that once there's a rubric

236
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,150
to which you

237
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,040
come in slave,
that becomes a dogmatic then,

238
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:11,590
then there's no room for nuance.
There's no room for hypocrisy.

239
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,410
Humor,
the transcendent Mirth,

240
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,210
chaos.
These forces need to be unleashed.

241
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,800
There's also things you can no longer 
laugh about because you're,

242
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:23,450
you know,
you're so committed to your axioms.

243
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,290
You can't,
you,

244
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,260
you dare not transgress against them.
And if that's deadly,

245
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:30,020
if you're a comedian,
because the rule for comedy would be,

246
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,380
and this is something I like about,
about Sarah Silverman for example,

247
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:36,440
is she will say anything if she thinks 
it's funny.

248
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,550
She's very daring in that manner and 
like I've heard her tell jokes that,

249
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,620
you know,
really would curl your hair,

250
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,930
you know,
but you can tell by watching or 

251
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:47,930
something will pop into her head and 
part of her golf,

252
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,611
tennis,
I don't know if I should say this and 

253
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:53,180
then she'll say it and it's often like 
horribly funny and horribly funny.

254
00:12:53,181 --> 00:12:55,130
Is a good kind of funny.
I mean it's,

255
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,940
it's,
it's daring and,

256
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,870
and it's something I really admire about
comedians too,

257
00:12:59,871 --> 00:13:02,660
is that they'll,
they'll take that risk and,

258
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:08,230
and it's something also that I've found 
disturbing about with regards to the 

259
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:15,941
many things I find disturbing about 
university campuses is that so many 

260
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:19,151
comedians won't go perform on university
campuses anymore because they can't be 

261
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:23,230
funny.
People get offended and it's a false.

262
00:13:23,231 --> 00:13:24,800
So fan of offended.

263
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,570
I think you're right.
I mean I think it's like a kind of Simon

264
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:30,900
says type of a like,
do you know that game?

265
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:35,901
Do you have that game in your language?
Just like are there certain things that 

266
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:38,751
we know we're not allowed to say.
There's certain things that we know 

267
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:39,480
we're supposed to think.
There's a kind of a,

268
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,140
a kind of form you like Donald's a 
courtly behavior,

269
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:48,230
I've heard it referred to as that we are
meant to pay homage to a particular type

270
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:54,540
of set of protocols and manners and it's
not necessarily anchored to a real.

271
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:59,541
Morality is not anchored to a sort of a 
sense of spirit to a sense of love or 

272
00:13:59,551 --> 00:14:02,910
kindness is about like,
these are the rules that we abide by.

273
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,130
I want to talk to you a bit about,
uh,

274
00:14:05,131 --> 00:14:10,131
the 12 steps and the model for handling 
addiction that I've written about myself

275
00:14:10,261 --> 00:14:15,261
in my book recovery because I want to 
see what you think of it like so like 

276
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,780
the 12 steps have anonymous fellowships,
which I,

277
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:23,781
if I were to belong to them,
I wouldn't be able to say I belong to 

278
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:23,850
them without breaching their code of 
anonymity.

279
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,080
But uh,
the,

280
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,240
what's positive about this approach to 
addiction is a,

281
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:31,450
as we have discussed off Mike,
a vet,

282
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,770
it creates community like the other 
people that I've got a similar endeavor.

283
00:14:34,771 --> 00:14:38,000
And in fact it was young,
the identified this,

284
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,010
this solution.
He said that like,

285
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,490
people that have got chronic addiction 
addiction issues will struggle to change

286
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:49,491
unless they have a spiritual realization
of some kind on the support for 

287
00:14:49,491 --> 00:14:49,491
community.
Yeah.

288
00:14:49,491 --> 00:14:53,830
Well,
I'm the spiritual realization component 

289
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:53,830
that's supported by

290
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,010
the relevant addiction literature.
One of the classic cures for addiction 

291
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:01,151
is spiritual transformation and the 
hardcore scientists have laid that out 

292
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:05,621
as as a reality in the addiction 
literature degree because the ease more 

293
00:15:05,621 --> 00:15:07,520
secular language around that as 
spiritual transformation could just be a

294
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:12,521
change of perspective or a renewal,
a radical change of perspective from an 

295
00:15:12,671 --> 00:15:16,400
a and it typically in my experience,
that's from a self centered view of self

296
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:21,401
obsessive view about gain,
your own needs met a solid cystic 

297
00:15:21,401 --> 00:15:25,930
narcissistic perspective of low life is 
this is just an adventure where I go 

298
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,160
around trying to accumulate and accrue 
to,

299
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,200
Oh wow,
I'm here to be of service.

300
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,800
That's of the transition in right 
microscopically,

301
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:39,310
but in addition to a community like 
having connections between one another,

302
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,440
the 12 steps themselves I think are an 
interesting model for transformation and

303
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:51,130
shouldn't be overlooked and in fact,
what my book was about is could that 

304
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,000
method be transposed to anybody who's 
interested in change?

305
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,610
So I wanted to talk to you about that to
get your perspective on them.

306
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The first step is acknowledging that you
were powerless over our addiction in 

307
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,200
your life has become unmanageable.
Just admitted this,

308
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,340
I don't want to be in this situation.
Okay,

309
00:16:04,341 --> 00:16:08,870
so there's two parts to that admission.
A one is that you're in trouble.

310
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,480
Yeah,
and I guess there's three.

311
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,540
You're in trouble and it's serious.
Things could be better and you don't 

312
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:18,980
have the wherewithal at the moment to 
make them better.

313
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:24,430
So the thing that's interesting about 
that is there's a kind of radical 

314
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,340
humiliation and humility that goes along
with that because you say,

315
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:29,780
I have a problem and what I know at the 
moment isn't sufficient to solve it.

316
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,330
Great.
Because now you've opened yourself up to

317
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:34,520
the possibility of learning something as
you say,

318
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:35,180
well,
I don't know.

319
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,530
I don't know enough to fix this.

320
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,280
It's like,
okay,

321
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:42,430
well you could learn.
And one of the things that's so 

322
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,270
interesting about people is that if they
decide they have a problem and they also

323
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:49,271
noticed that they could learn,
the probability that they will learn 

324
00:16:49,271 --> 00:16:50,150
goes way up.
That's very interesting.

325
00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:55,151
You've actually conflated the first 
three steps there in your analysis of 

326
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:58,250
the first one because the first one is 
admission that there's a problem.

327
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:03,251
The second one is recognizing that 
things could improve like counter 

328
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:04,250
believe that power greater than 
ourselves could restore us to sanity and

329
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:09,251
the third one is made a decision to turn
our life and our will over to the care 

330
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:09,690
of God as we understood God.
So like,

331
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,130
you know,
yeah.

332
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,680
We could talk about that from a secular 
goes back.

333
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,740
Well,
we could talk about that from a secular 

334
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:17,740
perspective and say,
well,

335
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,920
there's a.
there's a higher order moral principle 

336
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,260
that needs to be brought into the 
situation and you sort of described that

337
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,330
right at the beginning of the question 
because you said,

338
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,470
well,
what?

339
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,350
Partly what you do when you move from an
addicted state,

340
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,640
from a psychological perspective is 
moved from a viewpoint of the 

341
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,461
gratification of immediate desire and 
and maybe the accumulation of things as 

342
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:38,210
a marker of success to the notion that 
no,

343
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:43,211
you actually have a higher purpose and 
that higher purpose might involve being 

344
00:17:43,211 --> 00:17:44,690
of service.
That could be of service to yourself,

345
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:46,310
which means you wouldn't be addicted 
anymore.

346
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:48,620
Because that's not a good way of being,
of service to yourself.

347
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:51,570
But I've serviced to yourself and the 
broader community,

348
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:56,571
however you might define that that's a 
higher order purpose and can integrate 

349
00:17:56,571 --> 00:18:00,980
your motivations at at a level that 
doesn't leave you at the whim of 

350
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,821
impulse.
That's the purpose of a higher order 

351
00:18:04,821 --> 00:18:04,821
motivation.
So okay,

352
00:18:04,821 --> 00:18:06,130
so we've got three.
He asked that.

353
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,140
That's the first phase to get you to 
that position where you're willing to 

354
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:11,400
change,
believe in the possibility of change and

355
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:13,290
accept help in order to achieve that 
change.

356
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,960
The fourth and fifth steps are about 
inventorying.

357
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:21,000
Get like this is where the 12 step 
program becomes a fusion of spirituality

358
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:26,001
and psychoanalysis because the fourth 
step is like a a four column method 

359
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:30,231
where you write down a list of all your 
resentments in your life and childhood 

360
00:18:30,231 --> 00:18:31,110
resentments,
have resentments against the government,

361
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,360
people you work with,
you write it all down,

362
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:38,361
and then there's a diagnostic tool where
you identify what it is in you that 

363
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:42,590
doesn't like that.
And and also interestingly in a in 12 

364
00:18:42,961 --> 00:18:47,790
step theology that's called it,
it says that anything,

365
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,820
anytime that you are personally 
disturbed there is you have to take 

366
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,190
responsibility for it.
To a degree,

367
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:55,000
there is something in you that's been 
effective.

368
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,030
It should at least ask yourself that 
question.

369
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,270
Is it me or is it the world?
Yes.

370
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:04,550
Well,
let's consider first the possibility 

371
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:04,550
that it might be.

372
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,550
I wrote about that in the sixth rule,
right?

373
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,620
Put Your assault how?
Say around the house.

374
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,390
Yes,
yes.

375
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,160
In fact,
I've got our two Ra,

376
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:15,170
like my idea to truncate it and somewhat
more as a linguistically explicit 

377
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,920
explosive Laden version of the 12 steps.
And I've got your 12 rules for life here

378
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,690
and they don't necessarily correlate,
but like,

379
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:29,810
because like you say your first one,
stand up straight with your shoulders 

380
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:29,810
back.
I that.

381
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,080
So a great chapter I think I love about,
you know,

382
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,250
the lobster staff and they sort of the 
uh,

383
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,170
the ancient,
timeless,

384
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:39,171
all,
most roots of hierarchies and the 

385
00:19:39,171 --> 00:19:39,300
chemicals that are at play.
What's happening when you're,

386
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,040
what,
what is that play?

387
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:43,920
When we talk about self esteem,
I'm like,

388
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:49,070
and this year,
the sixth one set your own house in 

389
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,901
perfect order.
I said before you criticize the world 

390
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:51,120
steps four and five in the,
in a 12 step program,

391
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,890
deal with that inventory.

392
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,890
What's going on in your life inventory,
what your baggage is in your own 

393
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,161
personal opinion.
I think it's very practical that it's 

394
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:01,161
like,
well,

395
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:03,891
let's say you want to fix up your house,
which is actually quite a lot like 

396
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:05,490
fixing yourself up,
which is a very common dream metaphor.

397
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,940
Well,
the first thing you want to do is go 

398
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:10,940
look around and see what needs to be 
fixed.

399
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:10,940
You know,
and,

400
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,540
and the,
the interesting thing about that,

401
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:17,890
this is akin to what comedians do,
is that as soon as you're willing to 

402
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,710
admit Comedians,
look at a problem and then rise above it

403
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:24,711
right away and make a joke about it.
But as soon as you're willing to admit 

404
00:20:24,711 --> 00:20:28,010
that you have a problem,
then you're immediately contacted the 

405
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,540
part of yourself that's at least strong 
enough to admit that you have a problem.

406
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:35,930
And so as soon as the act of admitting 
the problem is actually the first step 

407
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:35,930
to solving it.

408
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:36,390
So you might say,
well,

409
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,450
and it it's an optimistic step because 
you might say,

410
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:44,451
oh my God,
I can't admit to that I have a problem 

411
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:44,550
because what if I can't solve it or.
Exactly.

412
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:47,650
So then maybe you won't admit to it.
If you do to it,

413
00:20:47,651 --> 00:20:52,651
you're simultaneously admitting to the 
possibility that you could solve it and 

414
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,460
then it can actually become something 
that's optimistic.

415
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,060
You can say,
well,

416
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:56,560
my life is horrible.
It's like,

417
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:59,380
okay,
but I'm doing 50 things wrong.

418
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,750
Well Great.
I can fix those things and then maybe it

419
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:06,751
wouldn't be so horrible.
It demonstrated the admission itself 

420
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:07,480
demonstrates progression and possibility
for further progression.

421
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,660
I think it relates.
That's why humility is always stressed 

422
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:12,660
in,
in,

423
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,960
in great religious traditions.
Humility is precisely that.

424
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:18,340
It's like you have to look at why you're
not so good.

425
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:23,970
Yeah,
and and you know that that has to break 

426
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:23,970
down your pride to some degree in your 
arrogance.

427
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:28,740
It's like,
well that's great because if you break 

428
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,391
down your pride and your arrogance,
then you're primed to learn and you can 

429
00:21:30,391 --> 00:21:30,430
solve your problems.
So there's nothing in that.

430
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,130
It's a bit crushing to begin with 
because you might think,

431
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:38,131
oh my God,
there's really a lot of things wrong 

432
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,261
with me,
but at least then you're on the on the 

433
00:21:40,261 --> 00:21:40,720
road to fixing them.
My personal journey of recovery has been

434
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,900
like a kind of death,
a light,

435
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,370
you know,
like when I was 27 it was like the death

436
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:49,060
of the drug addict self.
That guy does funny because I told Tammy

437
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:51,850
when we were coming here today that when
you were 27,

438
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:56,851
you made the decision to live.
I knew it was 27 because that's when 

439
00:21:56,851 --> 00:21:57,880
people,
I'm going to say like you,

440
00:21:57,881 --> 00:21:59,530
but you know,
celebrities who,

441
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,460
who are sort of on fire,
they die all the time at 27 because they

442
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:04,450
don't make that decision.

443
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,660
They decided that they don't decide that
they're going to take that final step 

444
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,800
into maturation.
They want to hold onto that Peter Pan 

445
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:13,800
thing,
that,

446
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,790
that pause.
You bet you exactly that.

447
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:20,770
They want to hold onto that and you 
can't hold onto that and live yes,

448
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:25,830
and then there's a further death.
I'm noticing now in my early forties so 

449
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,260
that are now at the midway point have 
been made in that sort of Dante,

450
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:34,300
esquire and now I'm moving towards the 
grave and now I'm like,

451
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,190
there's a different kind of alertness 
and merging and back to this step,

452
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,380
four and five minutes in this process of
inventorying.

453
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,070
After you've might an imagery and 
you've,

454
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:48,260
you've correctly,
you've honestly and openly put down 

455
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:48,700
everything,
incidents of child abuse,

456
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,340
things that you've said to other people,
things that your shame.

457
00:22:51,341 --> 00:22:54,730
Once you've been willing to inscribe 
your shame,

458
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,400
then you tell another person,
a person that you trust.

459
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,100
In the original literature it says,
you know,

460
00:23:00,101 --> 00:23:01,690
it could be a cleric,
a doctor,

461
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:05,410
or wherever.
It typically in a 12 step structures.

462
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:07,610
It's like a mentor figure,
but that has the.

463
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,620
That's the role of confession,
which obviously a huge part of 

464
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:12,620
psychoanalysis.
The point in your book,

465
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,210
I think this pertains to is when you 
took like the Dragon and the dragon gave

466
00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:20,211
that.
You said there was that Kid's book that 

467
00:23:20,211 --> 00:23:20,211
you read where it talks about the dragon
getting bigger and bigger.

468
00:23:20,211 --> 00:23:23,701
If it's not identified.
I think four and five are somewhat like 

469
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:23,701
that.
Yeah.

470
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:27,961
Well,
in part of the point of that kid's book 

471
00:23:27,961 --> 00:23:27,961
is that as soon as you turn around and 
look at something,

472
00:23:27,961 --> 00:23:32,130
it tends to shrink and that's partly 
because imagine that you have a memory 

473
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,940
that you won't confront.
Well,

474
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,040
there's something in that memory that's 
terrifying,

475
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:41,610
but and that means it's sort of 
associated with everything else that's 

476
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:41,610
terrifying and so it's horror.

477
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:46,370
It's horrible,
but then when you turn around and look 

478
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:46,370
at it,
you think,

479
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:46,370
yeah,
it's horrible,

480
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,590
but it's horrible in this precise and 
defined way,

481
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:52,400
and that takes it away from all the 
other potential horrors of it.

482
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:57,610
It starts to shrink it right away and 
also makes you into the thing that can 

483
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,520
turn around and look at the horror,
which is a real,

484
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,430
real positive transformation lacked on 
your part.

485
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:06,870
So it's true that somehow in the being,
being prescriptive and being specific,

486
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,610
the problem becomes manageable because 
it's limitless,

487
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,660
not fuel.
It becomes a apocalyptic in the end.

488
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,360
What?
What's the worst thing that Kevin is?

489
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,760
I could be destroyed and everyone I love
could be destroyed itself,

490
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,860
could be destroyed.
And until you say,

491
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:25,590
well actually know what this is is you 
feel inadequate because you weren't role

492
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:26,370
multiple.
Correct.

493
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,730
All right,
well I can maybe take care of that.

494
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,690
Right?
There's still bad,

495
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:31,160
but it's not everything.
And then you,

496
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,240
you phrased that exactly right.
Is that without that attentive 

497
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,820
delimiting it becomes apocalyptic.
That.

498
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,960
And that's a very,
very old idea.

499
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:42,290
So one of the things that happens in the
Mesopotamian creation myth,

500
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,350
Enuma elish,
is that the gods are created.

501
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,150
They're,
they're the,

502
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:51,180
they're the offspring of chaos.
That's a good way of thinking about it 

503
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,880
and they become very careless and they 
destroy their category system.

504
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:56,210
They destroy their father essentially 
and chaos comes flooding back.

505
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:01,810
And that's what happens to people who 
aren't looking at things and delimiting 

506
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:05,710
them properly.
They become up apocalyptic and do the 

507
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:05,710
mint.
So,

508
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,490
but sometimes in a mythology there is 
the positive too,

509
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,250
confronting confronting of the God age 
promethium.

510
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,010
So sometimes we need to steal,
steal the fire.

511
00:25:16,011 --> 00:25:18,640
Sometimes we need to challenge these 
orthodoxies,

512
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,220
don't we?
Yes sir.

513
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,590
Absolutely.
I mean,

514
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,680
part part of the well,
part of the death that you're describing

515
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:27,050
is actually the confrontation with a 
form of tyrant,

516
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,500
like your previously addicted self was 
the tyrant over your emergent self.

517
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:38,710
Yes,
and so it's an internal tyrant and you 

518
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:38,710
said it was predicated on a false value 
system.

519
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,270
That's a false set of gods essentially,
and so you had to confront that.

520
00:25:41,271 --> 00:25:46,271
That is a kind of death.
I also think that some the addiction or 

521
00:25:46,271 --> 00:25:49,631
addictive tendencies,
and I don't mean as severe as chemical 

522
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,971
dependency or forms of addiction 
addiction or a kind of self constructed 

523
00:25:51,971 --> 00:25:53,990
formaldehyde to preserve you in the 
state of trauma,

524
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:59,110
but trauma is acknowledged.
No means to navigate trauma are present 

525
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,640
because of the isolation,
because you have no mentor,

526
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,800
you have no.
You have no doctrine,

527
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,010
you have no community,
so addiction steps in,

528
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:10,070
this is how our preserved,
this is how I will not die.

529
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:14,960
I will find this notice that is a habit,
a repeated pattern to sustain you,

530
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,100
a holding pattern so that you don't die 
because there is no way out.

531
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:20,620
There's no guide,
there's no path.

532
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,420
You're just in the forest and there 
isn't a way out,

533
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:28,570
so I thought that addiction for a 
personal experience in that I hope and 

534
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:32,201
suspect more broadly is a means for sort
of status for preservation after trauma.

535
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:38,720
The rupture occurs is not addressed and 
a means for survival emerges in the form

536
00:26:38,721 --> 00:26:43,721
of addiction.
Addiction is not your nemesis is your 

537
00:26:43,721 --> 00:26:43,721
friend,
at least while you're in,

538
00:26:43,721 --> 00:26:47,291
whilst you're in.
There's certainly a literature on 

539
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:49,611
addiction that indicates that many 
people use addictive substances as a 

540
00:26:49,611 --> 00:26:51,870
form of self medication and they tend to
find the drug that best,

541
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,210
best medicates them,
let's say.

542
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,800
And for different people.
That's different.

543
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:58,010
Drugs.
Alcohol,

544
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,350
yeah.

545
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,520
Now say one of the other things that I'm
proposing in my book is to use one of 

546
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,230
the grandiose terminology is that the,
uh,

547
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:12,310
they template for a recovery from 
obvious forms of addiction could be 

548
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:16,620
applicable to less evident forms of 
addiction,

549
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:22,160
just patterns and habits.
And because so far the things that 

550
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,760
you've laid out would be,
would be in keeping with that idea.

551
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,350
Well,
you admit to the problem.

552
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:30,730
I really also,
I think the idea of laying out your 

553
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:34,431
resentments is unbelievably useful 
because that's also a way of dealing 

554
00:27:34,431 --> 00:27:37,911
with the malevolence within you that 
might interfere with your own recovery 

555
00:27:37,911 --> 00:27:40,560
because you're angry at yourself.
If you're angry at your parents,

556
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:45,561
if you're angry at the world,
the probability that you're going to be 

557
00:27:45,561 --> 00:27:46,560
in the mental state that's going to 
allow you to chart a positive course for

558
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:47,910
yourself is very,
very low.

559
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:52,970
How can you have a clear and authentic 
relationship with your wife if you've 

560
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,210
not correctly understood what you feel 
about your own mother?

561
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,970
If you feel like that you are enmeshed 
or trapped in some way?

562
00:27:56,971 --> 00:28:00,720
How am I supposed to have or have not 
understood that if I've not gained a new

563
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,020
perspective,
if I've not transcended it by sharing is

564
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,750
another person that in in the sleeping 
beauty story and the Disney story,

565
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:09,300
when the prince is encapsulated in the 
castle,

566
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:12,720
in the dungeon at the end and before he 
goes and rescues sleeping,

567
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:15,030
beauty,
he has to confront his terrible mother.

568
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,700
She turns into the dragon of chaos 
itself.

569
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,250
He has to use honesty and truth to 
confront her,

570
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,130
and until he does that,
he can't free the maiden from her sleep.

571
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,080
Yeah,
so that's called the,

572
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:30,290
that's called the freeing of the anima 
from the negative mother archetype and 

573
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:30,330
union psychology.

574
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,330
It's precisely that and that,
and that negative feminine will be 

575
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,541
overlaid on your partner unless you,
unless you're able to clarify it and 

576
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:42,741
clarify your relationship with it.
And that could be something like 

577
00:28:42,741 --> 00:28:42,741
overprotection or it could,
you know,

578
00:28:42,741 --> 00:28:44,970
in your past or it could be neglect for 
that matter,

579
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,480
or it could be the rejection at many at 
the hands of many,

580
00:28:48,481 --> 00:28:53,481
many women before you encountered this 
woman that you were going to bring that 

581
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,600
bitterness forward as a kind of 
projection.

582
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,080
If we are unwilling to undertake this 
kind of excavation,

583
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,640
then we asked them to continually have 
relationships that are cutaneous.

584
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:06,970
Just a superficial coordinates will 
govern our experience in relationships.

585
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,050
Uh,
so that's the repetition compulsion from

586
00:29:10,051 --> 00:29:14,070
a Freudian perspective is that,
that isn't how Freud explained it.

587
00:29:14,071 --> 00:29:15,930
That's how I would explain it.
But,

588
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,140
but the simple explanation of it is,
well,

589
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:24,141
if you bring the same set of priests 
unexamined presuppositions to every 

590
00:29:24,141 --> 00:29:26,010
situation,
the same fate will play out.

591
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,000
You might say,
well,

592
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,380
those women are the same.
It's like,

593
00:29:28,381 --> 00:29:33,381
well actually no,
but the part of the part of them that 

594
00:29:33,381 --> 00:29:35,940
you're able to make contact with acts 
the same every time.

595
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,010
That's a very different thing.
Brilliant.

596
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:43,040
And this is where six and seven,
the next steps are chronologically 

597
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,040
occur,
but

598
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,900
there's six.
Having done this inventory,

599
00:29:43,901 --> 00:29:47,020
you recognize what patterns have been at
play in your life,

600
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:51,370
which particular in the lexicon of the 
recovery defects of character,

601
00:29:51,371 --> 00:29:55,910
of governed you often pride wanting to 
control other people's perspective,

602
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,400
self pity,
self centeredness,

603
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:58,320
intolerance,
inpatients,

604
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,890
green jealousy,
envy,

605
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:04,891
lost slope for you.
Identify the seven deadly sins and how 

606
00:30:04,891 --> 00:30:05,970
they play out in your life essentially.
Yes.

607
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:11,100
And so,
and you become in step six is about 

608
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,260
becoming willing to live differently.
The saying,

609
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:16,060
are you actually willing to let go of 
last?

610
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,730
Are you or do you like lost when it 
comes to it,

611
00:30:18,731 --> 00:30:21,670
do you like being impatient?
Does it serve you in some way?

612
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:23,270
To be slothful,
it's.

613
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,340
It's highly probable that it does.
Yeah.

614
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:25,800
No,
it's.

615
00:30:25,801 --> 00:30:26,950
It's,
it's easy.

616
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:29,200
It's gratifying.
It's powerful,

617
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:34,380
it's pleasurable,
especially in the short term like 

618
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,110
there's lots of.
There are reasons that people are 

619
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:37,110
tempted by by the seven deadly sins.

620
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,000
Gloria,
Gloria,

621
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:45,020
and that's exactly right.
There's a dark romantic and you really 

622
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,530
see that in the depths of celebrities 
around 27 is they.

623
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,740
They fall in love with the allure of 
that kind of have that romantic death 

624
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,030
and he does the men,
so the Anti Libido,

625
00:30:55,031 --> 00:30:57,160
that dark libido,
that death force,

626
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,860
so with the.
Once you have diagnosed,

627
00:30:59,861 --> 00:31:04,861
which particular defects of character 
have been most prominent in your path 

628
00:31:04,861 --> 00:31:08,701
and become willing to let go of them.
This step seven is making a concerted 

629
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:14,460
and real effort to live without them and
this is where it kind of comes down to 

630
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,480
sacrifice theory.
That's what are you willing to sacrifice

631
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:21,481
in order to move forward,
you have to give up something that you 

632
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:21,481
love and you may have to give up the 
thing you love the best.

633
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:23,430
That's the fundamental sacrificial 
motif.

634
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,470
Sacrifices and the unattractive idea in 
our self.

635
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,220
In in our society that's based on 
consuming and indulgence and this is not

636
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,020
something that I would like.
So this is again,

637
00:31:32,021 --> 00:31:34,630
perhaps you were you a nice I'm.
What differ is that I would not,

638
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:40,020
whilst this will not change about the 
individual's engagement or kind of step 

639
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,150
one and acknowledgement that needs to be
changed.

640
00:31:40,151 --> 00:31:42,520
This is where I say there is a social 
responsibility,

641
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:47,730
but for whatever reason our society has 
become a manifestation of these darker 

642
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:50,330
impulses.
These are the prevalent forces,

643
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,790
at least in the kind of society I live 
in.

644
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:53,740
I think it was like to live in China or 
Libya.

645
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,860
I'm just saying like in London,
like what?

646
00:31:56,861 --> 00:31:59,360
Your emphasis on immediate 
gratification,

647
00:31:59,361 --> 00:32:04,361
too much emphasis on.
Because immediate gratification is a 

648
00:32:04,361 --> 00:32:04,361
tool of consumerism.
This would be my argument.

649
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,720
So like I it,
but at this point in the program,

650
00:32:07,721 --> 00:32:12,721
it's where the spirituality becomes,
I find personally undeniable.

651
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,460
But you have to,
uh,

652
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,080
you have to call to something else.
You have to in a sense,

653
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:25,110
be lay yourself open.
The idea of prayer becomes quite 

654
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,380
important now.
So there's a,

655
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:32,410
there's a union idea there.
So the union self is the thing that 

656
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,830
guides the ego through transformations.
So imagine the ego,

657
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:40,831
which is what you think you are,
or the thing about the ego is the ego 

658
00:32:40,831 --> 00:32:40,831
can be wrong

659
00:32:40,831 --> 00:32:45,430
and the ego can die and be reborn.
So what that indicates is that there's 

660
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:49,360
something underneath the Eagle can guide
that process of transformation and 

661
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,570
partly what you're calling on when you 
call on this higher power is at least 

662
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,911
from a psychological perspective,
it's a decision to rely on that thing 

663
00:32:57,911 --> 00:32:58,580
that can guide you through 
transformation.

664
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:01,010
Yes,
because surely as we said in relation to

665
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:06,011
another,
we are likely relate into a set of 

666
00:33:06,011 --> 00:33:06,380
coordinates that we impose on info 
commerce.

667
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:11,390
The female.
The same would be true of the cell that 

668
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:14,981
we have created an impression,
an egoic impression we've constructed 

669
00:33:14,981 --> 00:33:19,270
and our official self.
But beneath it there is our higher self 

670
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,540
or an exterior self that comes often 
composed of.

671
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:24,920
It's often composed of things that you 
refuse to or we're willing to develop.

672
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:26,810
And so when young talks about,
for example,

673
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:31,811
the incorporation of the shadow is that 
you've constructed a Nigo and there's 

674
00:33:31,811 --> 00:33:35,441
things it can do and can't do,
that it's allowed to do and it isn't 

675
00:33:35,441 --> 00:33:38,561
allowed to do,
and then there's a shadow domain that 

676
00:33:38,561 --> 00:33:38,600
would consist of those things that you 
could do but haven't.

677
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,840
And some of that's terrible,
but some of it's what you need to break 

678
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:43,840
free.
Is there a,

679
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,810
a infinite variety in the shadow or are 
there sort of templates there?

680
00:33:47,811 --> 00:33:52,811
Would you say that you know,
a common component of the last 

681
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:54,440
aggression aggression because they're 
the most.

682
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,210
The mobilized,
yeah.

683
00:33:56,211 --> 00:34:01,211
They're the two that are most difficult 
to integrate into the ego because 

684
00:34:01,211 --> 00:34:01,640
aggression destroys and of course lost 
subsumes.

685
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:03,350
The individual to,
to,

686
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,660
to well to sexual sexual desire is such 
a lust,

687
00:34:06,661 --> 00:34:08,840
isn't identified as a very powerful 
self.

688
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:10,190
It can,
it can subsume.

689
00:34:10,191 --> 00:34:15,191
So I suppose that's why a lot of 
theological doctrines focus on the 

690
00:34:15,191 --> 00:34:17,450
control of last another.
There is,

691
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:19,280
of course,
it's a disruptive force,

692
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:20,690
you know,
because for example,

693
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:25,691
if you make a medium to longterm 
relationship with someone in new 

694
00:34:25,691 --> 00:34:28,460
negotiate that that provides you with a 
stable structure that can operate across

695
00:34:28,461 --> 00:34:30,110
your entire life is good for you.

696
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,850
It's good for them,
it's good for your kids,

697
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:36,900
it's good for society,
but then if you're really attracted to 

698
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,430
someone momentarily,
you can be driven to act on that and and

699
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,310
every,
all the rest of that can burn up.

700
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:45,640
It's not good,
and so it's no wonder that it's viewed 

701
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,311
as a force of tremendous disruption.
Now it's also a force of tremendous 

702
00:34:48,311 --> 00:34:49,010
life,
right?

703
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:51,170
Because you want to be attracted to 
people.

704
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,730
You want to have that,
that,

705
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:57,170
that vital libido as part of part of 
what's driving you forward,

706
00:34:57,171 --> 00:35:00,350
but hopefully it's on your side and not 
working against you.

707
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:05,650
And so you know,
if you're successful and you've put 

708
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:05,650
yourself together and you're 
disciplined,

709
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,180
you should still be maximally sexually 
attractive,

710
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,490
but it should be under your control.
You're not a,

711
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,830
you're not the puppet of that force 
anymore.

712
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:16,010
It's integrated into you and that's a 
much better way to manage it.

713
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,430
How do you,
in your understanding,

714
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:22,330
how is the shadow incorporated?
What rituals,

715
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:27,331
what ceremonies,
what behaviors successfully incorporate 

716
00:35:27,331 --> 00:35:28,830
the shadow?
Say in using the example of last week,

717
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:33,890
what's a way back in for the sort of the
that it's been disembodied or repressed 

718
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,980
or it's a safe way for it back?
Is there one?

719
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,340
Well,
I think part of it is to,

720
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,910
is to admit to your desires within your 
own relationship,

721
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,290
you know,
because you might say,

722
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:46,960
well,
I'm,

723
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,690
I'm tired of my wife.
It's like,

724
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:49,500
well,
yeah,

725
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:54,501
maybe,
maybe you're tired of the games that 

726
00:35:54,501 --> 00:35:54,501
you're intelligent enough to play with 
your wife,

727
00:35:54,501 --> 00:35:56,550
but she's as plurry potential as you 
are,

728
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,040
and so you have to admit to your 
desires,

729
00:35:59,041 --> 00:36:04,041
let's say,
and maybe you have to make them 

730
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:04,580
consciously manifest within your own 
relationship and then you know,

731
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,960
when people can do that,
people do that by,

732
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,050
by dressing up or by,
by playing sexually,

733
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:10,530
I would say.

734
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:11,940
Yeah,
play.

735
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:16,941
Exactly.
That plays a transformative element and 

736
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:16,941
that's it.
You know,

737
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,640
and it might be that you're 
uncomfortable with the idea of,

738
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:23,890
of your wife as sexual play thing 
because you think that a woman who's 

739
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,190
married should be proper and Prim and 
should only behave sexually in a certain

740
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:27,510
way,
in which case,

741
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,600
well,
that becomes stale and dull and you're 

742
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:32,600
more likely to be tempted by something 
on the outside.

743
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,160
For me,
that's a very obvious example of how 

744
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,251
habitualized thinking is prohibitive 
even without reaching the extremes of 

745
00:36:41,371 --> 00:36:43,380
self destructive,
addictive tendencies.

746
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:47,040
If I have a habit of regarding my wife 
as,

747
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,490
as object day,
even if that's not a objectification,

748
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:54,210
is we're typically take care by limiting
beliefs about my wife,

749
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,170
that the tools that breakdown addictive,
uh,

750
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:01,140
thought patterns could be used to create
new terrains,

751
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,210
new liberty,
new play.

752
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,360
Thank you.
Um,

753
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,930
so like,
so once you've done up to step seven,

754
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:08,520
which is essentially a step seven,
you're right,

755
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:11,570
it's a sacrifice of the old self and 
handing over to the,

756
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,860
some kind of sublime divine self.

757
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,860
Um,
the,

758
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,880
the step eight is you make a list of 
people that you have harmed and become 

759
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,660
willing to make amends to them as you 
look back at your part and go,

760
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:22,860
God,
I shouldn't have stolen that.

761
00:37:22,861 --> 00:37:24,780
I shouldn't have done that.
I treated that person badly.

762
00:37:24,781 --> 00:37:25,980
That was wrong.
I lied.

763
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,000
So it's moral,
it becomes quite real repentance,

764
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:30,990
right?
And Atonement,

765
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:36,170
atonement is at one meant.
And if you're carrying transgressions 

766
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,800
that you regard as transcriptions now 
and your life,

767
00:37:37,801 --> 00:37:40,610
then you don't want to carry those for 
you want to,

768
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:43,230
you want to,
you want to step forward in life without

769
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:46,170
that moral burden because you will have 
contempt for yourself otherwise,

770
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:47,970
and you won't take care of yourself.
It also,

771
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:53,790
in a sense what you're talking about,
about allowing lust backend incorporate 

772
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,150
in last.
Then,

773
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,210
uh,
this is a more,

774
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:01,890
a broader method for incorporating 
annexed aspects of the self.

775
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,410
Like,
you know,

776
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,860
how can you fully love?
How can I fully love myself?

777
00:38:04,861 --> 00:38:07,890
I know I treated that person abominably 
well,

778
00:38:07,891 --> 00:38:11,220
if I go back and say that was wrong,
I did you wrong.

779
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,140
I owe you an amends.
You,

780
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:18,350
you invite that part of your life in you
amended your path through life as well 

781
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,770
as teaching yourself that,
that is not the way we proceed anymore.

782
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,990
That step pay,
and then that's a real.

783
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:27,010
That's,
that's taking our real action in the 

784
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:27,010
world.
It's not a hypothetical at that point,

785
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:31,670
right?
It's kind of like telling people what 

786
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:31,670
you've written down about your,
uh,

787
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,550
about your faults.
Yes.

788
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:33,780
Yes.
Because it makes it real.

789
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:38,781
When you,
when you're acting it out with someone 

790
00:38:38,781 --> 00:38:40,741
else,
it's not only a mental thing at that 

791
00:38:40,741 --> 00:38:42,391
point.
Furthermore indicates step by step a is 

792
00:38:42,391 --> 00:38:43,420
done separate from the step eight is 
right up the list of people.

793
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,100
Step nine is now.
Go through it.

794
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,020
It makes the distinction,
I think,

795
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:48,720
to create a space for you where you're 
going,

796
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,100
where you're not continually thinking,
I'm not fucking doing that.

797
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,110
I'm not going to apologize.
I was abused by them.

798
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,900
Fuck that.
They did as much wrong as I did not.

799
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,070
The point is not the point and also I 
think they might've done more wrong than

800
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:00,870
you did,
yes,

801
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,360
but you're still stuck with the fact 
that you did something wrong.

802
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,660
That's wrong,
that's not good,

803
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,360
and if you refuse to surmount the 
obstacle of like inner,

804
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:12,640
some arbitrary measure of who is more 
wrong,

805
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,600
then you continue to cast yourself in 
victim hood.

806
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:19,790
That's you have no personal autonomy,
so I choose to go for it.

807
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:25,140
It doesn't matter if you're only five 
percent at fault and it also doesn't 

808
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:25,140
matter if the other person apologizes to
you,

809
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:25,960
they should.

810
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,990
It would be better for them.
It might make things lay out.

811
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:34,020
That's not the point and this perhaps is
where what I think is significant that 

812
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,711
now your life has become not negotiation
between you and other be beings as they 

813
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:43,411
materially present themselves,
but between yourself and this higher 

814
00:39:43,411 --> 00:39:45,870
purpose that has been declared earlier,
that you are now operating on the common

815
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,970
spiritual plane.
You are no longer about.

816
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,180
If I do that,
I'll get that.

817
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,490
It precisely doesn't matter if a person 
goes,

818
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:56,491
I don't care if you apologize or not.
Religious language that would be 

819
00:39:56,491 --> 00:39:59,050
expressed as the discovery of your 
father in heaven instead of your earthly

820
00:39:59,051 --> 00:40:04,051
father because your father in heaven 
would be the higher spiritual authority 

821
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:08,320
to which you owe allegiance and and you 
can think about that either in religious

822
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:13,321
terms or a nonreligious terms,
is that what you've done is you've been 

823
00:40:13,321 --> 00:40:16,450
in some sense as you've abstracted the,
the idea of a higher authority and a 

824
00:40:16,841 --> 00:40:19,480
higher purpose and you've decided to 
devote yourself to that.

825
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:24,630
That's a religious app and that's 
precisely antithetical to postmodernism 

826
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,000
is saying that,
no,

827
00:40:25,001 --> 00:40:25,330
no,
no,

828
00:40:25,331 --> 00:40:26,530
no.
There is an essence.

829
00:40:26,531 --> 00:40:28,480
There is a country,
there is a way.

830
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,800
There is a trust.
That's right.

831
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:30,340
That's,
that's,

832
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,160
that's what is precisely antithetical.
Yes,

833
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:38,161
because the postmodern claim is that 
there are multiple ways of looking at 

834
00:40:38,161 --> 00:40:38,560
the world many ways,
and that's true,

835
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:44,460
but the antithesis of that is yes.
Just because there's multiple ways of 

836
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,821
looking at the world doesn't mean there 
are multiple proper ways of looking at 

837
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:47,821
the wounds.
In fact,

838
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:49,690
there's a very narrow range of proper 
ways of looking at the world.

839
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:55,260
My,
my concern with atheism has always been 

840
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,610
it's sort of easy affiliation with 
nihilism or why don't we just wondering 

841
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,670
is fucking people.
Then that sort of like,

842
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:03,070
that's like that's where my mind 
immediately goes,

843
00:41:03,071 --> 00:41:08,071
if there is not an order,
why not just smash everything to 

844
00:41:08,071 --> 00:41:11,031
smithereens and you're saying 
ideologically that is what's happening 

845
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:14,640
ideologically with deconstructing God.
We're the deconstructing morality with 

846
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,031
an agenda.
We're deconstructing and that was the 

847
00:41:18,031 --> 00:41:18,250
danger that both both nature and dusty 
Esq pointed to clearly.

848
00:41:18,251 --> 00:41:23,251
It's like you dispense with the 
transcendent principle and you open up 

849
00:41:23,251 --> 00:41:25,120
the landscape for impulsive nihilism.
What are they responding to?

850
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:30,121
Post enlightenment rationalism.
Is that what does the ski in nature or 

851
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:33,391
responding to why they weren't 
responding essentially to the idea of 

852
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:34,100
the death of God,
both of them and that

853
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,120
explicitly and is an enlightenment idea.
Like where is there,

854
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:41,030
where is death of God happening at?
The hair should be at the hands of a,

855
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:45,170
of a kind of arrogant and narrow 
rationalism and the materialism.

856
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:49,550
Yeah,
and the exposition of the exponentially.

857
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:51,650
That has led us to where we're going 
now,

858
00:41:51,651 --> 00:41:56,651
which is that kind of okay.
Sort of digging the earth from beneath 

859
00:41:56,651 --> 00:41:57,740
our feet,
putting us to the base.

860
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,160
That's,
that's a.

861
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:01,160
that's the hypothesis.
Precisely.

862
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,140
10,
11.

863
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:08,170
The last three steps.
Step 10 is a like a continued to make 

864
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:12,671
inventory,
so like let this process continued for 

865
00:42:12,671 --> 00:42:16,151
me in psycho analytic terms.
I'll see a therapist obviously like a 

866
00:42:16,151 --> 00:42:20,021
lot is when like when there's a moment I
know any spike in my energy if I go,

867
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,080
oh,
I felt so.

868
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:26,110
That was interesting.
I felt jealous there or I felt I felt 

869
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:26,110
small in that moment.

870
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,980
These are the moments I know and go,
oh,

871
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:32,981
how was I participate in that?
What belief of mine was being 

872
00:42:32,981 --> 00:42:32,981
challenged?
Is that a helpful belief?

873
00:42:32,981 --> 00:42:36,840
Belief being a thought that I like 
having a at 11,

874
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,870
that's a kind of consciousness is like,
well,

875
00:42:38,871 --> 00:42:40,790
I'm going to fall apart.
I'm going to make mistakes.

876
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:45,940
I don't want to make mistakes.
I'm going to keep an eye out for when I 

877
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,640
do make mistakes and I'm going to make 
them conscious and then I'm going to try

878
00:42:46,641 --> 00:42:50,450
to work on them bringing them into into 
consciousness because my fear,

879
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:53,570
my number one fear on a personal level 
and possibly on a social level,

880
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:58,571
I don't know quite how to extrapolate or
conflate those two notions is 

881
00:42:58,571 --> 00:43:02,411
unconsciousness.
I get very afraid when I'm dealing with 

882
00:43:02,411 --> 00:43:04,370
unconscious individually when I'm.
People don't know why they're doing what

883
00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:09,371
they're doing.
He may see this in sort of violent rage 

884
00:43:09,371 --> 00:43:11,270
or even in less dramatic theatrical 
behaviors feel.

885
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:16,500
There's a great idea that works.
At the bottom of the Christian 

886
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,441
mythological tradition is that a little 
bit of consciousness destroyed the 

887
00:43:20,441 --> 00:43:25,151
original paradise.
We became conscious enough to be aware 

888
00:43:25,151 --> 00:43:27,851
of our own mortality,
but the cure for that is way more 

889
00:43:27,851 --> 00:43:28,220
consciousness,
not a return to unconsciousness.

890
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,590
Yes,
there's no going back.

891
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:33,080
There's no going back.
I sometimes think the plethora of Zombie

892
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:38,081
movies is they don't know they're 
already dead and like so like that.

893
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:42,380
That danger of the Zombie is the danger 
of the desire for unconsciousness as a,

894
00:43:42,381 --> 00:43:45,140
as a solution to life's problems.
And I think that this is again something

895
00:43:45,141 --> 00:43:50,141
we're being invited to participate in 
for consumerism that live your life 

896
00:43:50,141 --> 00:43:51,590
continually on the frequency of 
unconscious energy,

897
00:43:51,591 --> 00:43:53,930
such a desire and fear that we're not 
being.

898
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,810
We're not being invited to participate 
on the level of consciousness,

899
00:43:56,811 --> 00:43:58,910
conscious interaction,
presence in the moment.

900
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:03,940
While you could make the case if you 
made the case that consumerism promotes 

901
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,780
the gratification of immediate desires 
above all else.

902
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,980
I think it does.
That's my,

903
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:09,280
that's what I'm pushing for.
Um,

904
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:11,470
with this original sin.
Like,

905
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:13,160
so a little bit of consciousness as a 
dangerous thing.

906
00:44:13,161 --> 00:44:14,930
We become with our vulnerability,
our mortality,

907
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:19,931
our nakedness and corporate real nature.
But the solution to this is to become 

908
00:44:20,481 --> 00:44:22,630
more conscious to we have to.
So,

909
00:44:22,631 --> 00:44:23,350
uh,
how do you,

910
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:26,090
how was that?
The Bible?

911
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:30,200
Yes.
Where does that get resolved?

912
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:31,590
Normally they get kicked out of the 
garden.

913
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,280
Part of part of what happens in in the,
in the redemptive story is if you think 

914
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:43,291
about Christ as a symbolic figure,
say is symbolic of the process of 

915
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:44,560
transformation that we just described is
one of the.

916
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:49,650
One of the morals of the Christian 
passion is that you need to radically 

917
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:53,860
accept your limitations and so part of 
this keeping your sins before your eyes,

918
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:56,800
which you just described.
Here's all the ways that I fall short of

919
00:44:56,801 --> 00:44:58,360
the glory of God.
Let's say,

920
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,880
you know I make this mistake.
I make this mistake,

921
00:45:00,881 --> 00:45:05,881
I make this mistake.
That's all consciousness and it's 

922
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:05,881
painful,
right?

923
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:06,790
Because you think,
well,

924
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:11,850
you become more conscious.
It's this glorious process of 

925
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,600
enlightenment and overall it is,
but the details are exactly this.

926
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,020
The things you need to become 
consciousness conscious of are precisely

927
00:45:17,021 --> 00:45:20,740
those things that you least want to 
become conscious of and that this is the

928
00:45:20,741 --> 00:45:25,741
motif that you identified in the 
alchemical tradition because the 

929
00:45:25,741 --> 00:45:26,800
chemical,
the chemical model,

930
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:31,950
so to speak,
was that which you most need to be 

931
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:31,950
found.

932
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:33,490
That which you most need to find will be
found where you least want to look.

933
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:35,560
Right?
Yes.

934
00:45:35,561 --> 00:45:38,380
And everyone knows that's true.
Like you tell someone that they go,

935
00:45:38,381 --> 00:45:39,130
oh yeah,
yeah,

936
00:45:39,131 --> 00:45:39,670
yeah,
that's,

937
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:40,720
yeah,
I know that's true.

938
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,200
So,
and that's also the greatest barrier to 

939
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:46,200
enlightenment because if a night moon 
was all,

940
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,010
you know,
tulips in sunshine,

941
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,110
then everyone would be enlightened,
but it's not,

942
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:54,910
it's this continual bringing before 
yourself all your proclivity for,

943
00:45:55,180 --> 00:46:00,180
for transgression.
And that's that and that obviously 

944
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,180
because how are you going to solve your 
problems if you're not aware of them?

945
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:04,330
He wouldn't want to be old discipline.
Did a jeweled Jordan.

946
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:05,650
Well,
it's not surprising,

947
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,250
but the alternative is far worse.
That's the thing.

948
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,400
And that is the district.
Because I was very curious.

949
00:46:12,401 --> 00:46:13,780
I was very curious.
Like I said,

950
00:46:13,781 --> 00:46:15,490
I talked about this with Tammy when we 
were coming here.

951
00:46:15,491 --> 00:46:18,580
I thought Russell decided to live when 
he was 27.

952
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,020
I can't.
I would like to know why.

953
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,490
So why did you,
why did you make the decision to,

954
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,000
to not allow what was consuming you to 
kill you?

955
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:33,450
In a sense,
it was taken out of my hands for the 

956
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:36,091
first time I encountered positive or 
mail or 40 figures who curiously like,

957
00:46:36,371 --> 00:46:39,430
or at least that we're able to address 
that in particular,

958
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:42,280
I was sent to a treatment center.
I had free mumps.

959
00:46:42,281 --> 00:46:44,830
I had time to think I timed to,
uh,

960
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,720
I,
I passed from childhood directly into 

961
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:50,720
addictive behaviors.
In fact,

962
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:55,471
those addicted babies were already 
present in childhood in less toxic form 

963
00:46:55,471 --> 00:46:56,110
in my relationship.
In retrospect,

964
00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:01,120
fruit chocolate was addictive.
My relationship with pornography as an 

965
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,560
adolescent addictive,
I was using it to,

966
00:47:02,561 --> 00:47:06,160
for medical medical purposes.
So,

967
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:10,000
so when substances became an option in 
adolescence,

968
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:13,700
it was seamless.
And that meant that my emotional,

969
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,840
my emotional growth was arrested at that
point.

970
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:19,310
The reason I was able to stop it because
inadvertent,

971
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,040
I was offered help.
I got,

972
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:24,490
I was given help our people that the 
management company that was working with

973
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,550
say your serious drug addicts,
you should go away.

974
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:29,410
Okay.
So partly that meant that they re,

975
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,280
they regarded

976
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,130
you as the sort of valuable commodity 
that was worth preserving.

977
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,110
Yes.
There was a degree of that.

978
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:35,650
Right?
Right.

979
00:47:35,651 --> 00:47:35,890
Well,
no,

980
00:47:35,891 --> 00:47:38,380
but that's helpful.
I mean regardless of.

981
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:40,510
Even if it's purely an economic 
interest,

982
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:42,400
there's,
there's something to that.

983
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:47,610
Yeah.
So and so then you went into treatment 

984
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:47,610
and you find some people say the place 
that I went,

985
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:50,260
it's run by an atheist chip summers,
but the 12 step principles,

986
00:47:50,261 --> 00:47:52,540
you can't unpick it from the Oxford 
Group,

987
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:57,541
first century Christian Group there and 
for me is more appealing when you talk 

988
00:47:58,211 --> 00:48:01,390
about it in terms of though I have no 
problem with the sublime and the divine.

989
00:48:01,391 --> 00:48:03,300
I live for that shit.
But like,

990
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:06,340
like I was always trying to get out of 
my head off my face.

991
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:10,570
Those were the things I want it a 
sublime experience experience of what is

992
00:48:10,571 --> 00:48:12,760
beyond the material.
That's what I want to know.

993
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:18,060
So,
but once I was in that environment and 

994
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,750
given drugs to help where I was addicted
to opiates,

995
00:48:19,751 --> 00:48:24,340
so I called subutex then and sleeping 
pills because I couldn't sleep.

996
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:29,610
And during that time I suppose in a way 
I didn't fully address the issue of 

997
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:33,871
addiction because my.
I was really promiscuous for about a 

998
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,370
decade,
but I that,

999
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,740
that behavior was transplant.
It was kind of effortlessly,

1000
00:48:38,741 --> 00:48:43,741
but I do remember a kind of moment of 
epiphany if apifany his revelation of 

1001
00:48:43,741 --> 00:48:47,440
previously concealed to truth when it 
first occurred to me,

1002
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:52,520
you,
I suppose you don't have to take drugs 

1003
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,661
every day.
I remember that thought entering and it 

1004
00:48:54,661 --> 00:48:54,661
being sort of like,
oh yeah,

1005
00:48:54,661 --> 00:48:56,830
I never thought about that because that 
I'd found a solution.

1006
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,610
It worked and worked as a way of 
managing pain,

1007
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:04,960
prevent infoview mental investigation or
discovery of conclusions that would have

1008
00:49:04,961 --> 00:49:07,600
been unhelpful and that wouldn't have 
been able to deal with.

1009
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,940
I think in a lot of cases,
and I'm sure there's many,

1010
00:49:09,941 --> 00:49:11,270
many variables,
uh,

1011
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:11,940
that,
uh,

1012
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:16,960
that actually chemical dependency is a 
successful technique for preventing 

1013
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,630
suicide.
There is just,

1014
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,800
this is a holding pattern to stop me 
doing something more dramatic and band.

1015
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:29,410
Unless people have access to an ideology
of structure and support that will help 

1016
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:29,410
them through that.
There's,

1017
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:34,500
it's very difficult to overcome.
And I was fortunate in that I was 

1018
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,410
granted that and then grant it this 
system.

1019
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:37,540
And so,
and as I've been working it,

1020
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:41,850
I've come to the conclusion that it is 
possibly universal,

1021
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:45,010
not because I think it's derived from 
universal ideas.

1022
00:49:45,011 --> 00:49:50,011
That's why I think young I've made that 
the identified some,

1023
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,470
like if there's a spiritual experience 
and then the support of community,

1024
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:56,980
that's how someone could be stopped from
drinking,

1025
00:49:56,981 --> 00:50:00,610
continually alcoholic drinking and then 
they took this process.

1026
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,890
They were 12 original 12 step 
fellowships,

1027
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:08,190
took the Oxford Group,
had a program of a sort of redemption 

1028
00:50:08,561 --> 00:50:10,980
and restitution and you know,
and like it,

1029
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,860
it seems initially in a,
I think in a materialistic society,

1030
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:19,970
counterintuitive to think that the 
solution to addiction is going to be 

1031
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:21,220
spirit,
spiritual awakening.

1032
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,320
But that's what it is.
And the,

1033
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:27,290
the final steps are stay connected once 
you like your continual inventorying for

1034
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:27,980
the moment.
We think,

1035
00:50:27,981 --> 00:50:32,981
oh,
I felt something there that you want to 

1036
00:50:32,981 --> 00:50:36,020
be in the moment connected.
Like I have to notice if I,

1037
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,360
if someone makes me feel inferior or if 
someone,

1038
00:50:38,361 --> 00:50:43,361
if I'm sexually attracted to someone,
those are the most obvious examples of 

1039
00:50:43,361 --> 00:50:44,030
something that will take me out of my 
connection.

1040
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:47,330
And then the final step is,
uh,

1041
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,760
made a hell puffers and remain awake for
it.

1042
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:58,870
The Hero's journey is,
once you go into the darkness and find 

1043
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:02,081
something of value,
the next thing to do is to distribute 

1044
00:51:02,081 --> 00:51:02,900
into distributed within the community to
bring it back and distributed within the

1045
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:03,410
community.

1046
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,820
Now Jordan d,
is it like it would be difficult for me 

1047
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:13,301
to accept that you've not been a sort of
personally affected and are not 

1048
00:51:13,301 --> 00:51:15,600
personally angry rather than just,
um,

1049
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:20,990
objectively because your personal 
trajectory I suppose in the public eye 

1050
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:25,301
at least began with the situation in 
Canada with a sort of forced speech or 

1051
00:51:25,821 --> 00:51:28,940
however it is termed now.
So like that.

1052
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:32,690
Are you able to distinguish between your
sort of sense of personal irritation?

1053
00:51:32,691 --> 00:51:35,360
Because I think for most people telling 
me what were,

1054
00:51:35,361 --> 00:51:36,540
whether or not you think that he's right
there.

1055
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:41,541
Academia seems like I'm an and celery 
area.

1056
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:44,870
It doesn't seem mainstream to most 
people like,

1057
00:51:44,871 --> 00:51:46,850
but to you it seems as though so very 
vital,

1058
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:48,010
but you are an academic.

1059
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:48,880
Well,
okay.

1060
00:51:48,881 --> 00:51:50,410
So there's,
there's two things there.

1061
00:51:50,411 --> 00:51:54,340
I mean,
people regard academia as ancillary,

1062
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:59,400
but it's not.
The reason it's not is because the 

1063
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:04,740
universities train the people who run 
things and so whatever's mainstream in 

1064
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:09,451
the universities right now,
even though it's separate from society 

1065
00:52:09,451 --> 00:52:11,980
is going to be mainstream everywhere 
five years down the road.

1066
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:13,600
And so that's,
that's a big.

1067
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,840
Is the vanguard academically?
No,

1068
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:16,370
there no doubt.

1069
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,580
Do you think what's happening now in 
terms of a media and politics?

1070
00:52:19,581 --> 00:52:20,100
You could,
uh,

1071
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:25,180
could say you could preemptively if 
diagnosed that from what's happening 

1072
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:25,180
five,
10 years years I

1073
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:25,180
think.
I think.

1074
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:30,101
I think that in some sense I was 
preemptively diagnosing it because I've 

1075
00:52:30,101 --> 00:52:33,830
been watching the politically correct 
postmodern types for quite a long time.

1076
00:52:33,831 --> 00:52:38,831
And one of the C,
one of the things I noticed about five 

1077
00:52:38,831 --> 00:52:38,831
years ago,
six years ago,

1078
00:52:38,831 --> 00:52:40,610
there were two things that I noticed 
that I really didn't like.

1079
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:44,450
The first is that because I'm a 
personality psychologist,

1080
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,490
as a researcher,
not as a clinician,

1081
00:52:46,491 --> 00:52:51,491
but as a researcher,
I know the literature on gender 

1082
00:52:51,491 --> 00:52:54,851
differences in personality because it's 
part of my field and I could tell that I

1083
00:52:55,551 --> 00:53:00,551
was starting to have some reluctance to 
deliver the lecture on gender 

1084
00:53:00,551 --> 00:53:02,840
differences and now I didn't stop,
but I felt,

1085
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:07,930
I felt that I was treading on thin ice 
by delivering those lectures and I 

1086
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:08,540
thought,
oh,

1087
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:11,450
that's not good because I'm like a 
comedian.

1088
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:14,500
I'm pretty much willing to say anything 
that I think is true and,

1089
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:19,630
and you know,
regardless of the consequences in some 

1090
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:19,630
sense,
because I'd rather take the consequences

1091
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:19,730
of what's true.

1092
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,480
And I thought this isn't good because if
someone like me who's,

1093
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:27,210
you know,
rather uncontrollably mouthy let's say,

1094
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:32,480
is starting to have second thoughts 
about teaching what's a very serious 

1095
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:32,820
topic and,
and something about which there's a very

1096
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,880
well developed science.
Then how much are other people starting 

1097
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,280
to censor?
And at the same time,

1098
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:40,560
my students,
many of whom were female,

1099
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:45,770
were telling me that they were really 
hesitant to talk about gender 

1100
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:47,340
differences in any of the courses they 
were running.

1101
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:48,270
And I thought,
oh,

1102
00:53:48,271 --> 00:53:50,490
this is not good,
this is seriously not good.

1103
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,530
And so,
and it's certainly the case that,

1104
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:58,720
that my colleagues censor themselves 
increasingly on campus with regards to 

1105
00:53:58,831 --> 00:54:01,170
the topics they're willing to discuss.
And it's subtle,

1106
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:06,200
you know,
because imagine in a given lecture I 

1107
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,730
could discuss any of 10 things and three
of them are taboo.

1108
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,550
Well,
I just won't discuss those.

1109
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:15,390
And that's that.
That's kind of invisible censorship.

1110
00:54:15,391 --> 00:54:16,800
It's not like I'll get up and say,
look,

1111
00:54:16,801 --> 00:54:19,770
I could have talked to you about gender 
differences in personality,

1112
00:54:19,771 --> 00:54:24,771
but I won't because I'm afraid I'll just
pick another topic because there's lots 

1113
00:54:24,771 --> 00:54:29,031
of topics to choose from.
And that means there's going to be a 

1114
00:54:29,031 --> 00:54:32,121
bunch of topics that are really 
important because actually the issue of 

1115
00:54:32,121 --> 00:54:35,451
sex differences in personality happens 
to be really important that people just 

1116
00:54:35,451 --> 00:54:39,471
won't talk about.
And the other thing that's so annoying 

1117
00:54:39,471 --> 00:54:42,471
about this is that,
especially with regards to sex 

1118
00:54:42,471 --> 00:54:42,471
differences in personality,
well,

1119
00:54:42,471 --> 00:54:45,390
let's say,
let's say that you're firmly on the side

1120
00:54:45,391 --> 00:54:47,220
of women.
Just for the sake of argument.

1121
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:51,510
Well,
do you admit to or deny the existence of

1122
00:54:51,511 --> 00:54:54,270
sex differences in personality?
What's better for women?

1123
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:55,770
Well,
you know,

1124
00:54:55,771 --> 00:54:57,480
the radical leftist basically say,
oh,

1125
00:54:57,481 --> 00:54:59,610
well those,
if you talk about sex differences,

1126
00:54:59,611 --> 00:55:04,611
then you're part of the oppressive 
patriarchy and you're attributing to 

1127
00:55:04,611 --> 00:55:08,331
women a different kinds of temperament 
in the attempt to continue the 

1128
00:55:08,331 --> 00:55:08,331
suppression.

1129
00:55:08,331 --> 00:55:10,050
But I could just as easily say,
it's like,

1130
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:10,950
well,
wait a second,

1131
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:13,860
like if you want to,
if you want to,

1132
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:18,910
uh,
give the individual the greatest degree 

1133
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:18,910
of freedom,
you say,

1134
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:19,580
look,
you,

1135
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:24,620
you're different from another person.
You're different on the basis of a 

1136
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:28,101
variety of your characteristics.
Sex being one of them that's going to 

1137
00:55:28,101 --> 00:55:30,150
have some effect on what sort of choices
you want to make in your life.

1138
00:55:30,151 --> 00:55:35,151
It's like go ahead and make whatever 
choices you want as far as their direct 

1139
00:55:35,151 --> 00:55:39,650
expression of your being.
And so if you deny the existence of 

1140
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:41,420
these sex differences,
which no one knows,

1141
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:44,670
serious commentator in the psychological
literature,

1142
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:47,340
in the personality domain,
and those are the people that know about

1143
00:55:47,341 --> 00:55:52,341
this thing,
nobody debates whether or not sex 

1144
00:55:52,341 --> 00:55:54,240
differences in personality exist or that
they have a biological component.

1145
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:59,670
No.
And what's also interesting about that 

1146
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:00,450
is that none of those people are 
conservatives.

1147
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:05,900
There are no conservative psychological 
researchers to speak up there in a tiny 

1148
00:56:06,211 --> 00:56:11,211
minority.
So the people that have done the 

1149
00:56:11,211 --> 00:56:13,461
research indicating that there are 
differences between the sexes and 

1150
00:56:13,461 --> 00:56:15,570
personality and that those differences 
have a biological,

1151
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:19,860
in part a biological component.
Those are liberal and left leaning.

1152
00:56:19,861 --> 00:56:23,010
People who've drawn those conclusions 
despite their,

1153
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:28,020
you know,
despite what their ideological 

1154
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:28,020
presuppositions might have suggested to 
them to begin with.

1155
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,950
So,
well,

1156
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:31,040
so you know,
it's,

1157
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:34,360
I don't know what to say about that 
except that it's all appalling.

1158
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:40,040
I suppose the fear must be that 
difference will ultimately be used for

1159
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:45,200
leverage for status.
And that's a reasonable fear,

1160
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:50,870
you know,
because because anything can be 

1161
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:50,870
manipulated,
but,

1162
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:54,140
but claims of identity can have identity
of claims that,

1163
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:58,740
that people are identical in some way 
can also be used for the same reason.

1164
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:02,640
You know,
if I insist that everyone is exactly the

1165
00:57:02,641 --> 00:57:07,641
same on all dimensions,
there's just as much of a totalitarian 

1166
00:57:07,641 --> 00:57:08,640
threat lurking in there as there is the 
threat lurking,

1167
00:57:08,641 --> 00:57:13,641
that we'll use differences as an excuse.
And we're also not having a serious 

1168
00:57:13,641 --> 00:57:14,250
discussion about this.
It's like,

1169
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:17,280
yeah,
there are men are overrepresented at the

1170
00:57:17,281 --> 00:57:19,710
top of the economic apex.
That's true.

1171
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,250
It's a small minority of men by the way.
It's certainly not men in general,

1172
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:28,370
but there are radically underrepresented
at the Bard overrepresented at the 

1173
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:28,370
bottom.
And believe me,

1174
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:33,201
man,
like nobody cares about men who are 

1175
00:57:33,201 --> 00:57:34,500
failures.
They are like off the bloody radar.

1176
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:35,300
So,
and,

1177
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,680
and there's no sympathy for men who are 
failures.

1178
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:41,160
So men stack up at the top and the 
bottom and,

1179
00:57:41,161 --> 00:57:46,161
and,
and we don't have a discussion about 

1180
00:57:46,161 --> 00:57:48,381
that and we don't have a discussion 
about the fact that women are radically 

1181
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:52,071
underrepresented in dangerous jobs.
Although they are or in or in or in in 

1182
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:57,060
trades that require like brutal physical
labor,

1183
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:01,020
women are radically underrepresented or 
in or in jobs outside.

1184
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:04,890
Women are radically underrepresented,
so the complaint is always,

1185
00:58:04,891 --> 00:58:09,891
well if you look at the top one percent,
it's there are more men than there 

1186
00:58:09,891 --> 00:58:10,530
should be,
you know,

1187
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:12,360
by pure sex division.
It's like,

1188
00:58:12,361 --> 00:58:13,740
well yeah,
but if you look at the bottom,

1189
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:19,100
the reverse is true.
So if we're gonna have the discussion 

1190
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:23,690
which are,
and I don't really necessarily think we 

1191
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:25,701
should have that discussion,
but if we're going to have the 

1192
00:58:25,701 --> 00:58:25,980
discussion then we should look across 
the entire economic spectrum.

1193
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:31,200
I wonder how much of this debate is 
being governed by unconscious forces.

1194
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:36,230
I wonder how much of what we're 
experiencing is a manifestation of a va 

1195
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:43,200
on a well,
we're cartography has not yet been a lot

1196
00:58:44,161 --> 00:58:45,840
of it.
What are you thinking about?

1197
00:58:45,841 --> 00:58:50,370
Any particular part of it?
What I feel like is that the reason that

1198
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:56,550
I say imagine that you are arguments 
that are based on research are so 

1199
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:59,751
successful is because people are 
expressing feelings as opposed to cogent

1200
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:06,560
and researched arguments.
It feels like there is a powerful,

1201
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:12,260
dominant patriarchy and no one can deny.
I mean that there is power there such a 

1202
00:59:12,451 --> 00:59:17,451
thing as power and there are people that
benefit from structures being as they 

1203
00:59:17,451 --> 00:59:19,900
are horse of class.
The point of those structures being the,

1204
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:25,010
they are.
One of the things I've observed is that 

1205
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:28,240
whenever change is discussed,
my tendency has always been to be 

1206
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:34,391
sympathetic towards movements that are 
about change or empowerment of what 

1207
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:37,670
might be termed disadvantaged groups.

1208
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:42,880
Um,
the change is that when you are curious 

1209
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,751
about the resistance of change or the 
difficulties that you face when trying 

1210
00:59:46,751 --> 00:59:50,021
to bring about change,
look at who would be negatively 

1211
00:59:50,021 --> 00:59:50,021
impacted,
where that changed to be bought about.

1212
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:55,480
Usually that means that there's some 
people for conservatism make sense to a 

1213
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:59,780
particular group of people.
One thing that I felt when I'm reading a

1214
00:59:59,781 --> 01:00:01,140
book,
whereas the,

1215
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,180
you know,
like I,

1216
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:07,660
I,
because I think you're coming from a 

1217
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:07,660
perspective of psychoanalysis and it 
rings very.

1218
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:10,400
The language rings true and the analysis
rings true.

1219
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:13,310
That what I,
where I feel.

1220
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,760
One question I was keen to bring to you 
is when you talked about skateboarders 

1221
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,540
in the,
or I think it's the last but one chapter

1222
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:22,850
and that spirit of uh,
uh,

1223
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:24,590
a young people,
yeah,

1224
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:29,650
courage and a willingness to try 
dangerous things and push forward and I 

1225
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:34,670
wonder how that sits with the idea of a,
an earlier passage in the book where you

1226
01:00:34,671 --> 01:00:35,760
talk about,
uh,

1227
01:00:35,761 --> 01:00:37,670
the gratitude that we should feel for,
you know,

1228
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:42,700
having time to read a book and the 
ability to read a book and sort of 

1229
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,720
respect for the establishment and 
systems that have been set up from which

1230
01:00:44,721 --> 01:00:46,160
we all benefit.

1231
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,810
Because when I,
you know,

1232
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:52,811
I,
I couldn't find it difficult to dispute 

1233
01:00:52,811 --> 01:00:56,410
your opinion about sort of churlish what
would have been in the lexicon of the 

1234
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:59,870
day social,
social justice warriors and that kind of

1235
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:03,850
somewhat rootless unresearched.
Right.

1236
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:04,920
You know,
I,

1237
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:05,690
I,
I,

1238
01:01:05,691 --> 01:01:10,691
I identify what you're saying.
There are people that can't keep their 

1239
01:01:10,691 --> 01:01:13,571
bedrooms tidy will be careful before you
let them organize an economic system.

1240
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:14,870
But like,
but,

1241
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:16,860
but similarly like,
you know,

1242
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,430
where is change going to come from?
Who are,

1243
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:20,900
who is going to challenge them?
Huge

1244
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:25,910
tyranny is it?
Those are the sorts of twin forces that 

1245
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:27,530
we have to contend with across the 
political spectrum,

1246
01:01:27,531 --> 01:01:31,850
so I could run through something quickly
to put the things that you just that you

1247
01:01:31,851 --> 01:01:33,380
just brought up in,
in,

1248
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:34,850
in perspective.
Let's say.

1249
01:01:34,851 --> 01:01:36,200
Okay,
so the first thing is,

1250
01:01:36,201 --> 01:01:41,201
is that hierarchies.
If you're going to value some things 

1251
01:01:41,201 --> 01:01:46,181
more than others,
then hierarchies are inevitable and you 

1252
01:01:46,181 --> 01:01:47,910
have to value some things more than 
others or you don't have anything.

1253
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,060
You all strength for something.
Well,

1254
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:52,460
what competence or shirt,
whatever,

1255
01:01:52,461 --> 01:01:55,010
whatever it happens to be.
The ability to play the flute,

1256
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:57,900
right?
It doesn't matter why on my list.

1257
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:58,490
Well,
what?

1258
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,920
What you know,
obviously if you value music,

1259
01:02:00,921 --> 01:02:05,921
then you're going to value some 
musicians more than others because some 

1260
01:02:05,921 --> 01:02:08,591
are better.
So it's and so you have to value things 

1261
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:11,621
in order to move forward in life and you
have to value things in order to have 

1262
01:02:11,621 --> 01:02:11,621
something valuable to produce.

1263
01:02:11,621 --> 01:02:13,790
But if you play out the value and the 
social landscape,

1264
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:18,791
you're going to produce a hierarchy.
And the problem with producing a 

1265
01:02:18,791 --> 01:02:21,551
hierarchy is that a small number of 
people are going to be successful than 

1266
01:02:21,551 --> 01:02:25,191
the majority and a very large number of 
people aren't going to be successful at 

1267
01:02:25,191 --> 01:02:26,130
all at at that particular thing.
It's inevitable.

1268
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,540
So okay,
now.

1269
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:28,890
So.
So you would say,

1270
01:02:28,891 --> 01:02:32,160
well we have to put up with that because
we need to pursue things of value.

1271
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:33,420
Okay,
fine.

1272
01:02:33,421 --> 01:02:37,260
So that's the right wing perspective is 
that the hierarchy's are justifiable,

1273
01:02:37,261 --> 01:02:39,660
unnecessary.
Now the left wing perspective is,

1274
01:02:39,661 --> 01:02:40,650
yeah,
but wait a minute.

1275
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:45,950
The problem with hierarchies is that 
people stock up at the bottom and that 

1276
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:47,790
they tilt towards tyranny across time.
And that's also true.

1277
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:53,090
And so you need that dialectic in 
society between the right wing that 

1278
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:53,090
says,
you know,

1279
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:58,130
we need the hierarchies and they're 
useful and you should be grateful for 

1280
01:02:58,130 --> 01:02:59,700
them and they structure you and give you
form and provide value.

1281
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:01,020
And the left that says,
yeah,

1282
01:03:01,021 --> 01:03:05,160
but they exclude people and people stock
up at the bottom and that's dangerous to

1283
01:03:05,161 --> 01:03:07,110
the hierarchy itself.
And it,

1284
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,360
it means that people might not have 
opportunity.

1285
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,420
And you have to say yes to that.
The problem comes,

1286
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:16,860
and this is the situation we're in right
now where the radical leftists,

1287
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:20,730
and this is mostly a problem that really
permeates the universities.

1288
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:22,650
The radical left is say,
yeah,

1289
01:03:22,651 --> 01:03:25,080
but all hierarchies are just tyrannical 
power.

1290
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:25,890
It's like,
oh no,

1291
01:03:25,891 --> 01:03:28,950
they're not.
Hierarchies are based on competence in a

1292
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:32,280
functioning society and mostly our 
society functions,

1293
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:35,580
so you need it.
You can't go that far.

1294
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:41,090
Now that doesn't mean that the 
hierarchy's don't tilt towards self 

1295
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:43,290
interest and tyranny across time,
but that's a bad thing.

1296
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:47,790
It's even a bad thing from the 
conservative perspective so well,

1297
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:52,970
so there's room for the left.
There's room for the left because the 

1298
01:03:53,401 --> 01:03:58,401
poor will always be with us.
That's the reason that there's room for 

1299
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:01,941
the left and that the dispossessed need 
a voice not least because there are 

1300
01:04:01,941 --> 01:04:04,170
talented people among the dispossessed 
and if they're stuck at zero,

1301
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,050
everyone suffers because we don't have 
access to their talents.

1302
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:09,960
It's bad use of resources,
but on the right it's like,

1303
01:04:09,961 --> 01:04:14,961
no,
we need the damn value hierarchies and 

1304
01:04:14,961 --> 01:04:17,111
we need to be grateful for our 
traditions and our structures because 

1305
01:04:17,111 --> 01:04:20,030
they,
they stop us from degenerating into 

1306
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:20,030
chaos.

1307
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:20,030
Oh,
so across the society,

1308
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:24,610
numerous hierarchies emerge and at some 
point decisions are being made about 

1309
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:28,271
which thing you know,
easy being a brilliant flutist or 

1310
01:04:28,271 --> 01:04:31,901
brilliant at tennis or brilliant owning 
land or controlling energy resources or 

1311
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:37,690
dominate in financial systems which are 
the hierarchies that are most important 

1312
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:43,090
and also the what because it's the way 
that resources are designated and 

1313
01:04:46,221 --> 01:04:49,550
challenging.
Those hierarchies seems to become,

1314
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:52,490
well almost impossible.
I'm,

1315
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:55,790
when I was leaving the hospital,
that brilliant hospital,

1316
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:58,400
they've been taken care of my mother 
recently,

1317
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:04,010
the window at the level of crisis and 
trauma and tragedy there.

1318
01:05:04,011 --> 01:05:09,011
Excellent.
They've got the sort of best doctors 

1319
01:05:09,011 --> 01:05:10,220
that guy might in griffith that operated
on her bow.

1320
01:05:10,221 --> 01:05:14,570
He's like a fantastic surgeon.
He is in fact him that trump was quoting

1321
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:19,600
when he talks about European hospitals 
with blood spatter flows from knife 

1322
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:23,221
crime.
It was a sort of a mangling of a quote 

1323
01:05:23,221 --> 01:05:23,221
that this might in griffith a given and 
then sort of like,

1324
01:05:23,221 --> 01:05:27,941
I step outside,
like I'm driving along along white 

1325
01:05:27,941 --> 01:05:30,661
chapel road and there are um,
electronic advertising boards and the,

1326
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:31,580
uh,
you know,

1327
01:05:31,581 --> 01:05:34,320
that require energy to tell me to eat,
you know,

1328
01:05:34,321 --> 01:05:37,390
sort of Mcdonald's or kit kats or 
whatever,

1329
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,730
and there's so much poverty on that 
street.

1330
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:44,110
There always has been in that part of 
Eastland and terrible poverty and I feel

1331
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:49,680
moments.
There are moments when I helicopter out 

1332
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,890
to the macro perspective that no 
individual can long hold or wait,

1333
01:05:50,891 --> 01:05:53,740
that can't be long born.
But in that moment I think,

1334
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:58,950
why is this hospital struggling for 
resources when we can afford to run 

1335
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:06,240
electronic adverts for Mcdonald's?
Who gets to decide how collectively and 

1336
01:06:07,961 --> 01:06:12,961
individually do we determine where 
resources and where power both in terms 

1337
01:06:12,961 --> 01:06:14,850
of energy but also in terms of human 
power and up.

1338
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:18,310
How were these decisions made?
And as you say,

1339
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:20,950
among the dispossessed,
there is,

1340
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:22,660
there are great resources,
great talent.

1341
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:26,440
One would imagine if the research were 
possible to the exact same degree.

1342
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:29,230
Is there is power and talent and among 
the possessed,

1343
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:34,350
because it's normally an accident of 
birth that decrease in reading about 

1344
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:38,071
your early life in Canada in a blue 
collar community and this sort of the 

1345
01:06:38,141 --> 01:06:41,920
mental health issues and the anger and 
agitation that grows there.

1346
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:47,040
So much of that is about resources.
The dispossession of the native people 

1347
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,820
of that area,
the mental health issues.

1348
01:06:48,821 --> 01:06:51,490
If your friend Chris like that.
For me,

1349
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:57,150
we are rising through these hierarchies.
We that have experiences of both side of

1350
01:06:58,391 --> 01:06:59,170
that line.
Well,

1351
01:06:59,171 --> 01:07:02,050
we are now challenging this evolutionary
force.

1352
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:05,140
We are now in a position to talk about 
these hierarchies,

1353
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:10,290
how they're ordered and how they're 
organized and whether there is room for 

1354
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:10,600
negotiation.
Well,

1355
01:07:10,601 --> 01:07:15,460
it's up to us to do that because there's
a risk in conservatism is saying,

1356
01:07:15,461 --> 01:07:17,110
well this is how the cards have fallen.

1357
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,800
Of course there is.
That is the risk and conservatism,

1358
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:22,580
so how do we use confront that?
While the risk is the,

1359
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:23,360
the,
the,

1360
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:28,460
the,
the hierarchies ossified and turn to 

1361
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:29,250
stone,
and then there's no mobility and and the

1362
01:07:29,251 --> 01:07:34,251
idea that that things can turn to stone 
and they become tyrannical is an 

1363
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:34,500
extraordinarily old idea.
For example,

1364
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:36,810
in,
in the story of Exodus,

1365
01:07:36,811 --> 01:07:39,060
the story of Moses,
so the Egyptian,

1366
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:44,390
the Egyptians are portrayed in that 
story as tyrannical conservatives 

1367
01:07:44,491 --> 01:07:45,690
essentially.
Right?

1368
01:07:45,691 --> 01:07:50,691
And they're masters of stone and Moses 
is a master of water and water is the 

1369
01:07:50,691 --> 01:07:54,891
thing that dissolves.
And so that drama's being played out in 

1370
01:07:54,891 --> 01:07:56,010
these stories that are thousands of 
years old and in the Egyptian story,

1371
01:07:56,011 --> 01:08:01,011
the ancient Egyptian story of Osiris and
Horus ocirus is the old king who becomes

1372
01:08:01,741 --> 01:08:04,290
too rigid.
And what happens to him is that he's,

1373
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:06,060
he's dismembered by evil.

1374
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:11,180
That's the consequence.
And so even the Egyptians long ago knew 

1375
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:14,061
that the danger of hierarchies as they 
become static and corrupt and tyrannical

1376
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:18,050
and part of what we do in our ongoing 
political dialogue and,

1377
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:23,120
and,
and when it's genuine dialogue is to 

1378
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:23,120
say,
well look,

1379
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:23,450
are these,
do these systems have it?

1380
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:25,640
We need them.
They're there not avoidable,

1381
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:27,950
but do they,
are they functioning properly?

1382
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:30,680
Are they loose enough so that people can
move?

1383
01:08:30,681 --> 01:08:35,681
Are they.
Are they serving the broader good or 

1384
01:08:35,681 --> 01:08:38,520
have they degenerated into something 
that's too tyrannical now you know you.

1385
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:43,600
You kind of pointed to both of those in 
the way you formulated that question 

1386
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:43,600
because you said,
look,

1387
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:47,441
well,
my mum was in the hospital and she 

1388
01:08:47,441 --> 01:08:50,051
needed care and so and I found a surgeon
who was an excellent surgeon and so.

1389
01:08:50,201 --> 01:08:55,201
So what you did there basically was take
a bow to the you bowed before the 

1390
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:58,700
functional hierarchy of the hospital and
said,

1391
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:03,701
look,
the greatest surgeon actually rose to 

1392
01:09:03,701 --> 01:09:03,701
the top and thank God for that because 
otherwise my mother would be dead.

1393
01:09:03,701 --> 01:09:04,220
It's like,
yes,

1394
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:08,690
that's our competency hierarchy and it 
could be contaminated by tyranny.

1395
01:09:08,691 --> 01:09:13,691
In which case it would be the brother of
some powerful person who ended up with 

1396
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:14,090
the surgical position.
Right?

1397
01:09:14,091 --> 01:09:16,490
And then everyone dies and that does 
happen in many,

1398
01:09:16,491 --> 01:09:21,491
many cultures where nepotism or 
connections define your position on 

1399
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:22,580
every axis,
but then you said,

1400
01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:24,680
well,
but I went out of the hospital and I was

1401
01:09:24,681 --> 01:09:29,681
driving down the road and I saw what 
appeared to be a misallocation of 

1402
01:09:29,681 --> 01:09:33,371
resources and what we have to do about 
that is have have a discussion about it 

1403
01:09:33,371 --> 01:09:33,371
constantly.
It's like,

1404
01:09:33,371 --> 01:09:36,470
are we allocating resources to the 
appropriate place?

1405
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:41,980
Now the,
the other lurking problem there is to 

1406
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:46,931
what degree do we decide about the 
allocation of resources by voluntary 

1407
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:48,760
effort,
by,

1408
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:53,820
by planning,
and to what degree do we let the market 

1409
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:56,591
take care of it.
And that's also something that 

1410
01:09:56,591 --> 01:09:56,591
continually requires negotiation.
That

1411
01:09:56,591 --> 01:09:57,360
market mate,
we don't trust that.

1412
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:58,770
Well,
that's the.

1413
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:01,950
That's the question is people talk about
it like it's a neutral thing,

1414
01:10:01,951 --> 01:10:05,850
but it's just a conglomeration of 
interest of the powerful.

1415
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:06,500
Well,
it's,

1416
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:07,830
it's,
it's a bunch of things.

1417
01:10:07,831 --> 01:10:12,831
I mean it's that it can be that,
but it can also be the way that we 

1418
01:10:12,831 --> 01:10:12,990
collectively value things.
Like,

1419
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:15,060
let me give you an example,
our collective values,

1420
01:10:15,061 --> 01:10:16,930
and I'll just quickly say I heard this 
thing,

1421
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:21,950
and in Sweden they a contract regulate 
and control access to alcohol at a state

1422
01:10:22,711 --> 01:10:24,840
level,
like off licenses or liquor stores.

1423
01:10:24,841 --> 01:10:28,350
They're sort of socially run and like,
and they're not allowed to be advertised

1424
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,490
in Sweden,
Sweden,

1425
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:32,390
I guess he's one of those havens of what
you might go.

1426
01:10:32,391 --> 01:10:37,391
I don't know what your views are.
Sweden by see a lot of stories about 

1427
01:10:37,391 --> 01:10:37,391
Sweden.
They seem a bit like a,

1428
01:10:37,391 --> 01:10:38,940
Hey,
we swayed and comes across as this.

1429
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:44,270
I guess I sort of this sort of 
postmodern democracy almost in some 

1430
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:44,270
respects.
Anyhow.

1431
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:44,730
Uh,
like I,

1432
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:49,750
I thought it was curious that they 
control alcohol in that manner and I am 

1433
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:51,600
envisaged the sort of breweries and 
liquor distributors would say,

1434
01:10:51,601 --> 01:10:53,010
Hey,
that's not free market.

1435
01:10:53,011 --> 01:10:58,011
You're controlling access to people's 
access to alcohol as if somehow the free

1436
01:10:59,401 --> 01:11:02,610
market was neutral,
but there is no neutral.

1437
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:07,760
If the market is what has the power of 
people's desires will be overly 

1438
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,480
stimulated.
People in people like if people are have

1439
01:11:09,481 --> 01:11:11,640
McDonald's,
advertise that they're more alcohol,

1440
01:11:11,641 --> 01:11:14,340
advertise that them people bloody 
McDonald's

1441
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:19,380
and alcohol.
There has to be some more realizing 

1442
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:21,990
force.
There has to be something that's not 

1443
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:24,081
economically lead.
That's not the manifestation of greed 

1444
01:11:24,081 --> 01:11:27,710
that's in the conversation.
Someone in a secular society where there

1445
01:11:27,721 --> 01:11:32,721
is no reasonable or trusted voice of God
have to be able to say don't drink too 

1446
01:11:33,691 --> 01:11:36,570
much alcohol or Mcdonald's because 
people will.

1447
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:37,240
Okay,
so.

1448
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:38,700
So see,
I think.

1449
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:44,120
I think the most effective solution to 
that problem is to have the economic 

1450
01:11:45,361 --> 01:11:49,740
system run,
let's say by distributed individuals who

1451
01:11:49,741 --> 01:11:53,570
are themselves aiming at a higher good.
So I think the way that you,

1452
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:56,400
the most effective way of regulating the
market so to speak,

1453
01:11:56,700 --> 01:12:01,700
is to improve the moral character of the
people who make up the market rather 

1454
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:05,361
than directly regulating the market and 
not that the market doesn't necessarily 

1455
01:12:05,371 --> 01:12:07,710
need some regulation because you might 
say,

1456
01:12:07,711 --> 01:12:11,850
well how about we don't devote alcohol 
advertising to children under 10?

1457
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,180
Most people would agree that that's a 
reasonable perspective.

1458
01:12:15,181 --> 01:12:18,570
And so that is limitation on market 
forces and there are places that you can

1459
01:12:18,571 --> 01:12:19,840
find that,
um,

1460
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:22,950
that,
that limitation being accepted by almost

1461
01:12:22,951 --> 01:12:24,000
anyone,
but,

1462
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:29,240
but part of what you're pointing to is 
that if the only thing that's governing 

1463
01:12:29,851 --> 01:12:32,880
the market is concerned for pure market 
success,

1464
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,310
than the market can produce all sorts of
excesses.

1465
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:37,680
But I think what you want,
you want,

1466
01:12:37,681 --> 01:12:42,180
what you want is to help orient people 
towards a transcendent good.

1467
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:44,590
That's a,
Oh,

1468
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:48,060
that's over and above market interest.
So you might say,

1469
01:12:48,061 --> 01:12:53,061
well,
what interests should you serve as 

1470
01:12:53,061 --> 01:12:54,921
you're trying to be successful as a 
comedian in while you're trying to make 

1471
01:12:54,921 --> 01:12:56,550
a living as a comedian say you might 
want to make sure that you're conducting

1472
01:12:56,551 --> 01:12:58,500
yourself appropriately in the 
marketplace.

1473
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:03,560
You're concerned about yourself,
but also your future selves because you 

1474
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:03,560
have to take.

1475
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:04,920
And that's partly why addiction is such 
a catastrophe,

1476
01:13:04,921 --> 01:13:06,450
right?
Because it's great in the short term,

1477
01:13:06,451 --> 01:13:08,640
but it's not so good in the medium to 
long run.

1478
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:11,070
So you have to take care of yourself 
and,

1479
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:13,680
and your,
your iterations through the future.

1480
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:18,980
You have to take care of yourself in a 
way that you're taking care of your 

1481
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:21,381
family.
You have to take care of yourself and 

1482
01:13:21,381 --> 01:13:21,750
your family in a way that you're 
benefiting the community and that should

1483
01:13:21,751 --> 01:13:26,751
be foremost in your mind.
So then when you start to make economic 

1484
01:13:26,751 --> 01:13:26,751
decisions,
even in your business,

1485
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:27,750
you're not saying,
well,

1486
01:13:27,751 --> 01:13:30,210
I'm going to do whatever I can to make 
as much money as I can.

1487
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:35,540
You're going to say I'm going to do 
whatever I can to make as much money as 

1488
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:38,850
I can while also making sure that I'm 
taking care of myself and my future self

1489
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:43,880
and my family and my community and being
like greg grateful for all of that and 

1490
01:13:44,101 --> 01:13:49,101
serving it properly.
And then I think the market can work 

1491
01:13:49,101 --> 01:13:49,800
more effectively but still might require
some,

1492
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:52,200
some discussion around the edges because
you know,

1493
01:13:52,201 --> 01:13:54,150
nothing is simple.
So the,

1494
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:58,290
the reason that I'm concentrating on the
individual and individual development is

1495
01:13:58,291 --> 01:14:00,960
because I think that's the best way to 
do that regulation.

1496
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,930
I think that's important.
I think it's non negotiable.

1497
01:14:03,931 --> 01:14:08,931
I think it's necessary,
but I also believe that if you have a 

1498
01:14:08,931 --> 01:14:12,220
society that's predicated on the some of
the worst aspects of human

1499
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:14,800
behavior and it lost the desire,
fear,

1500
01:14:14,801 --> 01:14:18,070
if last fear and desire are so high in 
the mix,

1501
01:14:18,071 --> 01:14:22,960
if you're continually being prompted 
towards own in Islam and consuming,

1502
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:27,010
I think it's the individual improvement 
will be insufficient.

1503
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:32,190
I I feel that your success is,
but I don't know it was based on,

1504
01:14:32,561 --> 01:14:34,930
but I feel like to a degree you've 
contacted people and oh yeah,

1505
01:14:34,931 --> 01:14:39,931
I can improve my own life.
I can have a bit of personal authority 

1506
01:14:39,931 --> 01:14:39,931
and autonomy and I think that's hugely 
positive,

1507
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:42,360
but if every time you step out of your 
house every.

1508
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:47,400
If every time you interface with society
or pick up your phone or look at a 

1509
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:50,641
screen,
the aspect of yourself that's being 

1510
01:14:50,641 --> 01:14:52,921
nurtured,
that's being invited to participate on 

1511
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:56,080
the lower aspects of your nature because
those are the most successful routes to 

1512
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:59,731
a person's decision making impulses and 
I think that it's difficult to exceed.

1513
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:04,150
I think it's difficult for these 
individual projects to to succeed.

1514
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,610
I think that your know certain people 
will have that,

1515
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:09,130
that message will take hold,
but others it won't,

1516
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:14,140
so on to some degree we.
I feel like I am a big fan of 

1517
01:15:14,951 --> 01:15:19,951
regulation.
I understand your irritation about 

1518
01:15:19,951 --> 01:15:23,611
what's being like this sort of a post 
modern deconstruction analyst argument 

1519
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:27,250
of that destroy God that has destroyed 
all categories.

1520
01:15:27,251 --> 01:15:27,910
Man,
woman,

1521
01:15:27,911 --> 01:15:30,340
none of it's real.
I believe in essence,

1522
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:32,020
the humors,
the deities,

1523
01:15:32,021 --> 01:15:34,570
the gods.
I feel these things are present,

1524
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:37,190
but I feel that we're already being 
subject.

1525
01:15:37,191 --> 01:15:42,191
We're kind of invisible tyranny,
that it's already happening and I don't 

1526
01:15:42,191 --> 01:15:44,910
think it's happening as a result of some
critical theory postmarks.

1527
01:15:44,911 --> 01:15:49,911
It's like,
I feel like that that's not where power 

1528
01:15:49,911 --> 01:15:49,911
is,
that it feels like it's sort of.

1529
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:52,790
It doesn't feel like it's just fucking 
powerful.

1530
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,320
Was Glaxo Klein or like,
no,

1531
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:59,200
it's not as powerful as a Halliburton or
like,

1532
01:15:59,201 --> 01:15:59,700
you know,
these.

1533
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:04,980
That's what I'm interested is power,
real power and how power is functioning 

1534
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:09,820
and how power is negatively impacting 
ordinary people.

1535
01:16:10,030 --> 01:16:15,030
Well,
I think it's perfectly reasonable to 

1536
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:17,611
point out that there might be multiple 
ways that people experience tyrannical 

1537
01:16:17,611 --> 01:16:22,420
oppression now because every hierarchy 
is going to tilt towards tyrannical form

1538
01:16:22,421 --> 01:16:27,421
in its own particular way,
and so I've been concerned about what's 

1539
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:29,020
happening in the university on the 
radical left and your concern,

1540
01:16:29,021 --> 01:16:34,021
the concern that you just brought up is 
something like a overwhelming large 

1541
01:16:34,301 --> 01:16:39,301
scale corporate dominance and I think 
that's also a reasonable set of 

1542
01:16:39,301 --> 01:16:39,420
concerns.
You know,

1543
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:41,620
it might not be for the best,
for example,

1544
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:44,800
that all of our communication is 
filtered through google.

1545
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:49,060
That might be a bit too much.
The question is,

1546
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:52,300
the question always is what we can do 
about it,

1547
01:16:52,301 --> 01:16:54,490
and I think the answer,
the answer is an answer to that.

1548
01:16:54,491 --> 01:16:59,491
Actually.
The answer is we can lead people's 

1549
01:16:59,491 --> 01:17:03,841
ability to communicate untrammeled and 
so that's why I'm an advocate of free 

1550
01:17:03,841 --> 01:17:07,651
speech.
We can leave people's ability to 

1551
01:17:07,651 --> 01:17:08,830
communicate untrammeled so that we can 
have intelligent discussions about those

1552
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:09,980
as they emerge

1553
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:15,040
and hopefully work towards solutions 
because we can't just generate a 

1554
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:15,110
structure rules that says,
well,

1555
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:20,530
here's the 10 rules that are going to 
deal without complex situation because 

1556
01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:23,450
things change too rapidly for that.
And the reason that freedom of speech as

1557
01:17:23,451 --> 01:17:25,700
far as I'm concerned is the paramount 
freedom,

1558
01:17:25,790 --> 01:17:26,690
the paramount,
right.

1559
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:31,280
Also the paramount moral obligation is 
because it's through the,

1560
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:33,550
it's through our ability to exchange,
to,

1561
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:34,780
to,
to,

1562
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:39,890
um,
to exchange honest opinions that we 

1563
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:44,140
participate in the process that enables 
us to keep tyranny of the sort that you 

1564
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:45,260
described and the sort that I described 
at bay.

1565
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:50,980
And so part of the reason that I've 
taken the tack I have politically is 

1566
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:54,101
because while my government had the gall
to implement compelled speech 

1567
01:17:54,101 --> 01:17:57,110
legislation without noticing what it was
that they were interfering with,

1568
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:58,660
because you might say,
well,

1569
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:01,130
well that's,
that's pretty much the end of it.

1570
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:03,290
How do you keep tyranny at bay?
Free?

1571
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:08,480
The x?
The proper exchange of ideas between 

1572
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,770
free individuals keeps tyranny at bay.
That's the best we've got.

1573
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:14,980
It doesn't work perfectly and it's also 
I think a gift that England and in in 

1574
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:18,911
large part has given to the rest of the 
world to formalize and codify that to 

1575
01:18:18,911 --> 01:18:22,991
put it into a body of law to erect 
governmental structures that are really 

1576
01:18:22,991 --> 01:18:26,411
predicated on that idea.
It's a remarkable achievement and it's 

1577
01:18:26,411 --> 01:18:27,110
something we should be profoundly 
grateful for.

1578
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:32,610
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about the taking 

1579
01:18:32,610 --> 01:18:32,650
that accepting praise on the behalf of 
England.

1580
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:37,680
There as an English person accept that 
there are two dragons.

1581
01:18:38,321 --> 01:18:43,321
Then there is the inner and the at least
until we've reached some non-dualistic 

1582
01:18:43,321 --> 01:18:48,150
utopia where everything is one.
There is the inner dragon of our own 

1583
01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:53,071
desires and fears,
but I suppose like when we're talking 

1584
01:18:53,071 --> 01:18:56,971
about management of resources,
is that a phrase that we came up 

1585
01:18:56,971 --> 01:19:00,750
earlier?
Let the where where does the attention 

1586
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:01,640
need to go and it's difficult like you 
know me,

1587
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:06,690
I suppose there's something about my 
background that has led me to identify 

1588
01:19:06,690 --> 01:19:06,700
as the Dragon.
Oh,

1589
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:10,030
is consumerism is turning people into 
consumers because obviously as an addict

1590
01:19:10,031 --> 01:19:15,031
that's what I am,
a consumer and a truck and Cima and it 

1591
01:19:15,031 --> 01:19:18,750
seems that you,
with your background in academia are 

1592
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:21,590
the,
a neo Marxist post because like when I 

1593
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,710
sort of like think about aspects of 
socialism,

1594
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:24,840
egg,
you know,

1595
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:27,820
people are working to artist only work 
four hours a day.

1596
01:19:28,270 --> 01:19:30,130
They should be time for fishing in the 
afternoon,

1597
01:19:30,131 --> 01:19:33,640
which I think is in Das capital.
He talks about fishing in the afternoon.

1598
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:38,790
Yeah.
For me that seems like a very beautiful 

1599
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:42,030
and fair and just idea.
Also I don't see them like,

1600
01:19:43,241 --> 01:19:45,250
yes,
I can imagine that they're irritating on

1601
01:19:45,251 --> 01:19:49,460
a campus.
Particularly for somebody who's research

1602
01:19:49,461 --> 01:19:53,470
such a law.
I don't see them as powerful.

1603
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:56,950
That's my,
that's part of my intrigue.

1604
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:00,190
I suppose it's comparable to when I was 
talking to Sam Harris,

1605
01:20:00,191 --> 01:20:01,900
another post who I admired,
but who am I going?

1606
01:20:01,901 --> 01:20:03,040
Oh yeah,
but I don't like,

1607
01:20:03,041 --> 01:20:08,041
you know,
like when I'm talking to Sam Harris 

1608
01:20:08,041 --> 01:20:08,041
about Islam,
but when like where's,

1609
01:20:08,041 --> 01:20:08,041
how

1610
01:20:08,041 --> 01:20:13,040
is Islam and gonna be like,
I feel like even if he's aware of Saudi 

1611
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:17,390
Arabia and Wahhabism like Saudi Arabia 
as an economic entity then on Islamic 

1612
01:20:17,401 --> 01:20:19,800
entity in terms of race,
go do some Islam.

1613
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:21,820
It's like they go do some business.
No,

1614
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:25,890
and so I suppose here,
well my,

1615
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:31,310
when I'm concerned mostly I'm concerned 
mostly with the emphasis on,

1616
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:34,860
on the collective identity rather than 
the individual identity.

1617
01:20:34,861 --> 01:20:37,440
Like the process that you just 
described,

1618
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:42,860
I would say,
and this is the answer to the question 

1619
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:45,501
that you posed at the beginning of our 
conversation is is there something 

1620
01:20:45,501 --> 01:20:45,501
universal about the process that you 
laid out?

1621
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:50,310
And I think there is and I think it's at
the core of individual development and I

1622
01:20:50,311 --> 01:20:55,311
think it's the most powerful of forces 
and so I think that the individual 

1623
01:20:55,311 --> 01:20:57,360
should be regarded as the proper locus 
of evaluation.

1624
01:20:57,450 --> 01:21:00,210
And the problem I have with the 
postmodern new Marxists types,

1625
01:21:00,211 --> 01:21:03,720
apart from the fact that their analysis 
tends to lead to a kind of nihilism,

1626
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:08,730
is that because they're making the group
the paramount level of analysis,

1627
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,410
this sort of thing gets ignored.

1628
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:15,980
And I what I'm trying to do in my work,
we have a program called the self 

1629
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:19,971
authoring program that kind of steps 
people through these 12 steps that you 

1630
01:21:19,971 --> 01:21:23,421
just described.
The first thing that people do is write 

1631
01:21:23,421 --> 01:21:23,421
about their past all the emotional 
experiences.

1632
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:26,520
The second thing they do is take an 
inventory of their personality,

1633
01:21:26,521 --> 01:21:30,450
faults and virtues so that they can 
rectify the faults and capitalize on the

1634
01:21:30,451 --> 01:21:35,451
virtues.
And the third thing they do is chart a 

1635
01:21:35,451 --> 01:21:37,170
course for the future that takes them 
into account and others.

1636
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:42,620
And so,
and I see it as a reflection of this 

1637
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:42,620
universal process that you just 
described it.

1638
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:46,290
I think it's the most powerful form of 
transformation,

1639
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:51,620
but more importantly,
I also think it's the one that risks 

1640
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:54,741
doing the least harm.
Like it hasn't hurt anybody that you've 

1641
01:21:54,741 --> 01:21:55,680
put yourself together.
It's just good.

1642
01:21:55,930 --> 01:21:57,120
Writing is good for you.

1643
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,390
It's good for the people that know you,
there's nothing about it and it's.

1644
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:05,540
It's the right level of humility because
you took what you knew to be wrong in 

1645
01:22:06,541 --> 01:22:09,750
your experience.
You took personal responsibility for it.

1646
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:13,770
You made changes for yourself.
You didn't go around pointing the finger

1647
01:22:13,771 --> 01:22:17,040
at what was wrong with the external 
world and trying to fix it.

1648
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:22,070
Now look,
it could easily be that once you have 

1649
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:25,131
your act together or maybe even before 
you should be doing some things to 

1650
01:22:25,131 --> 01:22:27,120
adjust political systems or sociological
systems,

1651
01:22:27,121 --> 01:22:30,810
but the problem with that is what makes 
you think you can trust yourself?

1652
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:32,430
You know,
and it's like,

1653
01:22:32,431 --> 01:22:33,490
well,
I'm compassionate.

1654
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:38,540
Like maybe maybe you're also envious of 
the successful and the probability of 

1655
01:22:38,540 --> 01:22:42,981
that is pretty damn high by the way,
and so you better know before you 

1656
01:22:42,981 --> 01:22:44,670
express that compassion,
especially in the political domain,

1657
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:49,790
whether or not that is contaminated by 
things about yourself that you haven't 

1658
01:22:49,790 --> 01:22:49,790
contended with.

1659
01:22:49,790 --> 01:22:53,340
Do you think a declaration or along 
those lines,

1660
01:22:53,341 --> 01:22:57,360
I'll specifically that in the political 
field would be refreshing?

1661
01:22:57,450 --> 01:22:58,650
Look,
I'll tell you one of the.

1662
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:00,840
This is a very funny thing,
so the ancient,

1663
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:06,410
the emperor of Ancient Mesopotamia,
so this is some of the earliest 

1664
01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:06,490
political we have.
By the way.

1665
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,320
Here's what they used to do to the 
emperor.

1666
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:13,470
Every new year's Day,
they would take them outside the walls 

1667
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:16,861
of the city,
so he was responsible for everything 

1668
01:23:16,861 --> 01:23:17,440
within the walls.
Outside was chaos on the unknown.

1669
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:22,680
They'd take them outside the city.
They'd strip him of all his emperor 

1670
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:23,110
garb,
so he's no longer emperor.

1671
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:25,480
They'd make them Neil,
they'd humiliate him.

1672
01:23:25,481 --> 01:23:26,920
I think the,
if I remember correctly,

1673
01:23:26,921 --> 01:23:29,320
the priest would hit them with a glove 
and say,

1674
01:23:29,321 --> 01:23:31,270
okay,
in the last year,

1675
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:36,540
how name all the ways that you didn't 
embody Marduk Marduk was the god of the 

1676
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:38,740
Mesopotamians.

1677
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:41,950
Marduk was the thing that took on the 
great dragon of chaos,

1678
01:23:42,190 --> 01:23:45,280
and so it was the.
It was the responsibility of the emperor

1679
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:50,310
is to kneel down and say,
here's all the ways that I haven't been 

1680
01:23:50,310 --> 01:23:54,540
acting out my proper self,
and it brought the kingdom into 

1681
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:55,270
disarray,
and then he will be forgiven.

1682
01:23:55,271 --> 01:23:57,670
They would act out the reconstruction of
the cosmos.

1683
01:23:57,671 --> 01:24:02,671
That was the New Year's celebration and 
then he'd go in and try to be a good 

1684
01:24:02,671 --> 01:24:02,671
king.
I like so.

1685
01:24:02,671 --> 01:24:02,920
Yeah.
Yeah,

1686
01:24:02,921 --> 01:24:04,180
no kidding.
Absolutely.

1687
01:24:04,181 --> 01:24:09,181
It's like the confession of the emperor 
is this the way I haven't been good at 

1688
01:24:09,181 --> 01:24:09,181
anything

1689
01:24:09,181 --> 01:24:13,860
comparable.
A the powerful held up to that kind of 

1690
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:16,000
evaluation in.
We don't have rituals for that.

1691
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:21,420
Well,
I suppose we don't acknowledge the 

1692
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:23,071
emergence of order from chaos.
We don't have a a merge or acknowledge 

1693
01:24:23,071 --> 01:24:24,630
divine principles,
so the powerful light,

1694
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,820
and I think this is possibly because of 
assumed meritocracy,

1695
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:29,590
but people that are in positions of 
power,

1696
01:24:29,591 --> 01:24:34,591
they're there for a reason.
You don't need to start stripping him 

1697
01:24:34,591 --> 01:24:34,591
naked and take them outside the city and
Santa.

1698
01:24:34,591 --> 01:24:37,060
How often did you rank in that Oval 
Office everyday get out.

1699
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:37,990
Yeah,
well,

1700
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:42,130
I think there might be something to that
and that's the danger of pride that goes

1701
01:24:42,131 --> 01:24:43,990
along with ascension and a hierarchy.
Well,

1702
01:24:43,991 --> 01:24:46,240
because I'm here in this position,
I must deserve it.

1703
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:46,990
It's like,
yeah,

1704
01:24:46,991 --> 01:24:51,991
but there should still be something that
you're bowing down to and that might be 

1705
01:24:51,991 --> 01:24:53,530
the abstract idea of sovereign authority
itself.

1706
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:55,480
If you think about it only 
psychologically,

1707
01:24:55,600 --> 01:25:00,600
that's a figure that essentially has a,
a touch of divinity about it because 

1708
01:25:00,731 --> 01:25:00,840
it's

1709
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:03,270
be on a key right now.
Harm.

1710
01:25:03,271 --> 01:25:06,710
So that's the Queen,
the anointed and appointed monique,

1711
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:11,840
she represents so.
But I suppose in a post secular nation 

1712
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:12,450
she becomes the emblem of Britain,
Robin,

1713
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:14,830
the emblem of God on right.
Well,

1714
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:19,860
I think,
I think it actually functions to some 

1715
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:19,860
degree in the same way as well.
I do think so because the queen

1716
01:25:19,950 --> 01:25:22,770
your queen in particular our queen as 
well because I'm Canadian.

1717
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:23,440
Aiden,
you know,

1718
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:26,850
I mean,
I think Elizabeth has been a,

1719
01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:29,550
uh,
an embodiment of moral virtue.

1720
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:34,820
I mean,
she's done a remarkable job over the 

1721
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:34,820
last,
what is it,

1722
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:37,341
75 years now she's held herself to an 
incredibly high moral standard and I 

1723
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:39,720
think she does sit in the background as 
emblematic of what

1724
01:25:40,190 --> 01:25:45,190
sovereign authority might look like.
Of course you're a postmodernist and 

1725
01:25:45,190 --> 01:25:46,340
this is an area where,
because I'm English and I can't get away

1726
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:51,341
from the love of the Queen,
but I would also say that she is an 

1727
01:25:51,341 --> 01:25:54,461
emblem of authority and of power and 
wealth and land owners shit,

1728
01:25:54,990 --> 01:25:58,970
and there is that,
there is an order that will be respected

1729
01:25:58,971 --> 01:26:01,700
and can't be challenged every so often 
in this country,

1730
01:26:01,701 --> 01:26:04,040
sort of toys with the idea of 
republicanism that always

1731
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,380
grateful when there's a wedding,
right.

1732
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:07,400
There is this week so that no one has to
think,

1733
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:12,580
is this right?
Are we paying for these bizarre 

1734
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:12,580
spectacle?
Yeah.

1735
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:12,580
Well,
but it.

1736
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:15,170
But it is useful to think about it in a 
symbolic sense.

1737
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:20,171
I mean,
one of the things that constantly 

1738
01:26:20,171 --> 01:26:20,171
threatens the United States,
I think there should be four branches of

1739
01:26:20,171 --> 01:26:21,770
government,
legislative,

1740
01:26:21,771 --> 01:26:24,710
judicial,
executive,

1741
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:28,130
and symbolic.
Because the problem in the United States

1742
01:26:28,131 --> 01:26:30,440
is the president keeps tilting towards 
king,

1743
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:32,780
you know,
the Americans like the idea of the first

1744
01:26:32,781 --> 01:26:34,730
family and the first lady.
And it's like,

1745
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:36,650
yeah,
no,

1746
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:37,580
and,
and,

1747
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:42,600
and kind of tilts towards a dynasty.
And you've seen that happen with the 

1748
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,030
bushes and the Clintons and it's not,
it's not a good thing,

1749
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:48,440
and it might be nice to have someone 
take the symbolic load off the president

1750
01:26:48,441 --> 01:26:53,441
and just act that out.
And your queen does that very nicely 

1751
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:56,620
because all of the pomp and circumstance
of the state and all the drama and 

1752
01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:59,240
ritual of the sovereign can be played 
out in that sort of dramatic space.

1753
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:02,360
And your legislature and executive 
branches can go off and do.

1754
01:27:02,361 --> 01:27:04,490
The administration is interesting that 
the,

1755
01:27:04,491 --> 01:27:05,240
uh,
the,

1756
01:27:05,241 --> 01:27:08,630
the,
the dentist steeze exert themselves in a

1757
01:27:08,631 --> 01:27:13,631
sense.
It's a demonstration of your argument 

1758
01:27:13,631 --> 01:27:16,391
that there are certain hierarchy systems
that find their way into fruition 

1759
01:27:16,391 --> 01:27:19,481
regardless of regulation.
But then I suppose there's rational 

1760
01:27:19,481 --> 01:27:22,511
reasons they would have the resources,
the experiences that can make the 

1761
01:27:22,511 --> 01:27:22,511
connections.
It's easier for them.

1762
01:27:22,511 --> 01:27:26,741
But that's also the,
that's a danger to a republic is the 

1763
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:29,411
fact that.
And it's part of the potential 

1764
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:31,541
corruption of the state is that while 
it's easier for the children of those 

1765
01:27:31,541 --> 01:27:35,831
who have authority to have power and you
don't want people attaining the pinnacle

1766
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:41,291
of achievement because of power,
he wants to attending the pinnacle of 

1767
01:27:41,291 --> 01:27:41,500
achievement because of competence.
Yeah.

1768
01:27:41,610 --> 01:27:43,670
Yeah.
And those things always struggle.

1769
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:44,540
They all.
And,

1770
01:27:44,541 --> 01:27:45,020
and it,
it,

1771
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:50,050
it takes a society that's very awake to 
stop the hierarchies from degenerating 

1772
01:27:50,050 --> 01:27:54,060
into hierarchies of power because the 
generation is the tendency chirp.

1773
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:55,840
While it's easy,
it's easy.

1774
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,580
Wba Pam.
Yeah.

1775
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:00,100
Fearsome and terrifying.
Uh,

1776
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:02,600
you know,
the full cannot pallium well,

1777
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:07,460
and people have recognized that it's the
proclivity of hierarchies to,

1778
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:08,930
towards tyranny,
for,

1779
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:10,580
for really,
for thousands of years,

1780
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:14,690
I've seen that as a fundamental danger 
to proper adaptation.

1781
01:28:14,810 --> 01:28:16,580
We need hierarchies,
yes.

1782
01:28:16,850 --> 01:28:20,580
But they degenerate into tyranny and 
they unfairly oppressed.

1783
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:21,500
It's like,
yes,

1784
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:26,860
we have to be on guard against that,
but that doesn't mean that we call all 

1785
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:28,040
hierarchies tyrannies because that's not
helpful.

1786
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:31,750
Or we call all productive activity 
service in the,

1787
01:28:31,810 --> 01:28:36,810
in the service to the oppressive 
patriarchy because that's seriously not 

1788
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:41,591
how helpful and we don't dispense with 
hierarchies because then people don't 

1789
01:28:41,591 --> 01:28:41,591
have anything to do.
So.

1790
01:28:41,591 --> 01:28:42,720
Yes.
So I see.

1791
01:28:42,721 --> 01:28:46,550
I get the beam out your.
I say if the individual is tuned,

1792
01:28:46,551 --> 01:28:51,551
if the individual is I channel that I 
like a prayer of Saint Francis,

1793
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:53,360
I like.

1794
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:58,360
It is a multiple.
The invites us to find the reverse of a 

1795
01:28:58,850 --> 01:29:01,010
h,
a defective characteristic.

1796
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:06,110
We all seen that we might be living out 
to become a channel of some inherent 

1797
01:29:07,021 --> 01:29:09,430
goodness.
Well,

1798
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:14,540
the thing that's one of the things 
that's interesting rolled out or two 

1799
01:29:14,540 --> 01:29:17,421
things actually.
The first is the word sin means to miss 

1800
01:29:17,421 --> 01:29:17,421
the target.
It's an archery term.

1801
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:22,610
So that's quite.
That's a very interesting way of 

1802
01:29:22,610 --> 01:29:22,610
thinking about it because it means that 
there is a target,

1803
01:29:22,610 --> 01:29:23,700
there is a target.
That's the thing,

1804
01:29:23,701 --> 01:29:26,460
but the next thing is,
and this comes right out of that,

1805
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:31,440
is it's very useful to become aware of 
your faults because as soon as you pause

1806
01:29:31,441 --> 01:29:36,441
it a fault,
you pause it the opposite by merely 

1807
01:29:36,441 --> 01:29:36,441
saying,
well,

1808
01:29:36,441 --> 01:29:36,750
that's a fault.
You're saying implicitly,

1809
01:29:36,751 --> 01:29:38,490
while there's something that's the 
opposite of that,

1810
01:29:38,491 --> 01:29:43,491
so out of your recognition of faults 
immediately some clarity of virtue 

1811
01:29:43,491 --> 01:29:44,940
develops because you might say,
well,

1812
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:46,500
this is a fault and I really know it.

1813
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:47,130
It's like,
great.

1814
01:29:47,131 --> 01:29:50,940
You've got some bedrock there.
Whatever the opposite of that fault is,

1815
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:56,150
you might not know what that is,
but whatever the opposite of that fault 

1816
01:29:56,150 --> 01:29:56,580
is is a virtue,
and then you might say,

1817
01:29:56,581 --> 01:29:57,990
well,
I have 20 faults.

1818
01:29:57,991 --> 01:30:01,560
It's like great.
The opposite of the personality that has

1819
01:30:01,561 --> 01:30:05,850
all those 20 faults is the virtuous you,
whatever that might happen to be,

1820
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:06,570
well,
great.

1821
01:30:06,571 --> 01:30:09,180
Then you've then you've conjured out of 
the devil.

1822
01:30:09,450 --> 01:30:11,880
I'm a redeemer.
It's something like that.

1823
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:17,210
I like that,
and then I'm down to play both in terms 

1824
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:22,460
of cosmology and fleeting morality.
There is chaos,

1825
01:30:22,711 --> 01:30:26,250
there is vastness,
but there are also patterns.

1826
01:30:26,251 --> 01:30:31,251
There are patterns that emerge and 
whether you call that pattern mail or 

1827
01:30:31,251 --> 01:30:35,720
love or beauty,
there are various patterns and I feel 

1828
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:37,710
that there is something to get in 
alignment with.

1829
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:39,990
There is a tune,
there is harmony,

1830
01:30:39,991 --> 01:30:42,800
there is melody,
there is grace would not.

1831
01:30:43,530 --> 01:30:46,640
And all you're using their musical 
musical.

1832
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:48,690
Um,
what would you call analogies,

1833
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:54,260
presentations.
That's what music expresses is to have 

1834
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:55,320
all of that in harmony,
live music because of that,

1835
01:30:55,740 --> 01:30:56,790
you know,
in those patterns,

1836
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:58,440
because music,
you think about music,

1837
01:30:58,441 --> 01:31:03,441
it is the harmonious interaction of 
patterns and you just described all 

1838
01:31:03,441 --> 01:31:04,440
those positive,
uh,

1839
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:05,760
what would you call them?
Spirits.

1840
01:31:05,761 --> 01:31:08,010
That's a good way of thinking about it 
as patterns.

1841
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:13,130
While they are patterns.
Then you might think that there's a 

1842
01:31:13,130 --> 01:31:13,130
pattern that's composed of all of those 
patterns.

1843
01:31:13,130 --> 01:31:14,070
Well,
that's what you're after.

1844
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:17,040
You're after the pattern that's composed
of all those patterns.

1845
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:18,330
Yes,
absolutely.

1846
01:31:18,331 --> 01:31:19,950
And you want to put yourself in harmony 
with that.

1847
01:31:19,951 --> 01:31:21,960
And that is a real thing.
That's a real thing.

1848
01:31:22,170 --> 01:31:26,130
You can feel that.
So it's what keeps you alive essentially

1849
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:28,890
when you're trying to become conscious.
He,

1850
01:31:28,891 --> 01:31:29,730
yes,
yes.

1851
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:31,380
There is something important happening.

1852
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:36,680
I feel like what we were saying before 
about the acknowledgement of difference 

1853
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:41,330
need an infor inferiority.
That is something that is definitely not

1854
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:43,300
what we should be actually.
Well,

1855
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:48,360
this is part of what the radical leftist
keeps saying is what we should celebrate

1856
01:31:48,481 --> 01:31:49,380
diversity.
It's like,

1857
01:31:49,381 --> 01:31:54,381
yes,
but what that means first is the 

1858
01:31:54,381 --> 01:31:56,070
admission that people actually differ.
You don't have diversity.

1859
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:58,140
It's like,
I'm glad there are conservatives.

1860
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:02,290
I'm glad there are leftists.
The conservatives run things.

1861
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:07,770
The leftists invent them.
It's like good and they're really 

1862
01:32:07,770 --> 01:32:08,320
different.
Those people like you know,

1863
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:11,290
if you have a group that's all 
conservatives and they're going down the

1864
01:32:11,291 --> 01:32:16,291
right path,
they're going to go down that path 

1865
01:32:16,291 --> 01:32:18,061
really fast,
but if they're going down the wrong 

1866
01:32:18,061 --> 01:32:20,131
path,
they're not going to be able to think 

1867
01:32:20,131 --> 01:32:20,131
laterally and figuring out how to get 
out of it.

1868
01:32:20,131 --> 01:32:21,700
If you have a group of of left leaning 
creative types,

1869
01:32:21,701 --> 01:32:23,890
it's like they're going to come up with 
100 ideas,

1870
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:29,340
but the probability that they'll 
organize in a stable hierarchy and 

1871
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:30,610
implement those effectively is zero.

1872
01:32:31,030 --> 01:32:32,830
They're going to have to call over the 
conservatives.

1873
01:32:32,831 --> 01:32:33,670
It's like,
look guys,

1874
01:32:33,970 --> 01:32:38,970
we finally got a good idea.
You can have one idea because you're 

1875
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:42,480
conservatives run with it and then they 
can all run with it and so it's really 

1876
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:46,621
good that we have people who are like 
that on both sides of the distribution 

1877
01:32:46,621 --> 01:32:50,551
because otherwise the,
the creative types and sit around and 

1878
01:32:50,551 --> 01:32:53,980
come up with new ideas until they starve
to death in squalor and the are.

1879
01:32:54,130 --> 01:32:54,880
Well.
Exactly.

1880
01:32:54,881 --> 01:32:57,610
And the Conservatives would just ossify 
and,

1881
01:32:57,670 --> 01:33:02,670
and you know,
run down a road that got narrower and 

1882
01:33:02,670 --> 01:33:06,031
narrower and narrower and they'd all end
up stuck between two cliffs and that'd 

1883
01:33:06,031 --> 01:33:06,640
be the end of it for both of them.
Thesis,

1884
01:33:06,641 --> 01:33:08,530
antithesis,
synthesis.

1885
01:33:08,890 --> 01:33:13,890
We require synthesis.
This is how does the interplay of 

1886
01:33:13,890 --> 01:33:13,890
opposites.
Actual opposites.

1887
01:33:13,890 --> 01:33:14,320
Yeah,
yeah,

1888
01:33:14,321 --> 01:33:19,321
yeah.
They Yin-yang that over the s there 

1889
01:33:19,321 --> 01:33:19,321
needs to be necessarily collusion 
between distinction,

1890
01:33:19,321 --> 01:33:24,151
but for that to happen,
that needs to be acknowledgement and 

1891
01:33:24,151 --> 01:33:24,310
recognition of difference.
But in a,

1892
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:29,360
trying to achieve a quality with the 
annihilation of category is no 

1893
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,150
successful.
That's exactly right.

1894
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:34,060
That's exactly right.
That's not a successful route.

1895
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:38,170
Thank you doctor.
Professor Jordan,

1896
01:33:38,171 --> 01:33:40,030
psn.
We have good chats.

1897
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:41,380
Steinway.
That was great.

1898
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:42,580
Yeah,
that was really good.

1899
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:43,780
Hmm.
Absolutely.

1900
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,120
Thanks for inviting me back.
Thank you.

1901
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:47,230
Thank you for your time.
Thank you.

1902
01:33:47,231 --> 01:33:47,950
Thank you,
Tammy.

1903
01:33:48,010 --> 01:33:48,280
Thank you.
