1
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,620
Oh,
hi

2
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,230
guys and girls and interested others.
So on October 18th,

3
00:01:08,941 --> 00:01:12,600
I received a letter from the University
of Toronto asking for my silence with

4
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:17,601
regards to what I've been discussing.
On September 27th,

5
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:20,670
I made a video I called fear and the
law,

6
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,030
which was a discussion of what I believe
to be a set of particularly insidious

7
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,260
legislative moves on the part of the
provincial and federal governments in

8
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:35,370
Canada.
I'm laying the groundwork for requiring

9
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:37,650
a certain kind of compulsory speech
from,

10
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,680
from the citizens of Canada.
And I commented in that video that I

11
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:46,440
believed that the act of making the
video itself and discussing the issues

12
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,240
that are relevant to that legislation
was probably illegal.

13
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,480
I'm on October third.
I made another video decrying the

14
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,250
University of Toronto Human Resources
Departments,

15
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,250
recent decision to make anti racism and
anti bias training mandatory partly as a

16
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:10,560
consequence of their interactions with a
group called the black liberation

17
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:11,610
collective,
which is,

18
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,930
I'm not a particularly savory group to
say the least.

19
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,300
And then on October fifth,
I did another video by recorded another

20
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:23,730
video laying out what I described the PC
game,

21
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:25,000
which is,
um,

22
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,520
uh,
an ideologically motivated victimization

23
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:34,521
slash perpetrator game.
And I outlined some counter tactics in

24
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:37,530
those videos.
I said that discussion of gender issues

25
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:39,900
has probably become illegal now in
Canada,

26
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,680
maybe even a hate crime.
I'm one of the consequences of that was

27
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:48,681
a number of lawyers wrote articles
saying that I was just scaremongering

28
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:53,640
and that bill [inaudible] for example,
doesn't have that intent.

29
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,570
I didn't say precisely that bill
[inaudible] had that intent,

30
00:02:57,571 --> 00:02:59,680
although I believe it opens the door to
such things.

31
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:04,681
But I did say that the surrounding
policy discussions on the Ontario Human

32
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,670
Rights Commission,
which is not a good place,

33
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,920
um,
indicated that,

34
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,600
that it probably had become illegal.
And I would say the fact that the

35
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:15,460
university has now written me two
letters,

36
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,280
suggesting that in fact what I was doing
was illegal.

37
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,270
Makes my argument better than any but a
better than anything I could do.

38
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,730
I also said that biological sex,
gender identity and gender expression do

39
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:31,420
not vary independently.
And they don't vary independently by the

40
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:33,880
way,
even though that's become axiomatic in

41
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,790
the underlying legislation,
and they don't vary independently

42
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:41,791
because the overwhelming majority of
people have a gender expression,

43
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,280
gender identity and biological sex that
are the same in that 98 percent of

44
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,460
biological males identify as male and
dress as males.

45
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:56,461
And the same is true of females.
So they don't vary independently.

46
00:03:56,711 --> 00:04:00,820
People confuse that with me saying that
there were no such thing as say

47
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:04,750
nonbinary people or transgender people.
And I never said that,

48
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,180
but that doesn't really matter.
Apparently.

49
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,750
Uh,
my fundamental concern was that we are

50
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,860
now legally required to use an approved
language when speaking and when speaking

51
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:18,310
about fundamental issues like gender and
there's very few issues,

52
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:19,480
more fundamental than gender.

53
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,680
And I said that I wouldn't do it because
it is a very dangerous requirement.

54
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:29,190
It's the first time that I can tell
where instead of restrictions on free

55
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:33,850
speech being of the sort,
that there are things you can't say say

56
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:36,910
hate crime things.
And I'm not an advocate of hate crime

57
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,230
laws,
by the way,

58
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,270
hate crime speech laws.
I think they're dangerous.

59
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:42,460
But in any case,
I can understand why people think

60
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:45,640
they're necessary,
but this law requires us to use a

61
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:49,690
certain kind of approved language.
And I thought that that was a line we

62
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:53,590
shouldn't cross.
I also said I wouldn't mouth the words

63
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:57,040
of the ideologically possessed and that
was with regards to gender neutral

64
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:01,390
pronouns because those pronouns which
haven't passed into common usage by the

65
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:03,130
way,
because they're very awkward and not

66
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:06,730
well crafted to me,
they're words that have been produced by

67
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:11,731
a certain kind of radical left wing
activist radical egalitarianism whose

68
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:17,401
ideology I regard as perhaps posing the
most serious threat to the freedom of

69
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:19,420
the West that currently exists.

70
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,860
And so I'm not going to use their words.
And I said that free speech is in

71
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:27,820
serious danger in Canada because of an
onslaught of radical leftist ideology.

72
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,370
So that was basically my,
uh,

73
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,080
my claims.
Um,

74
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:35,590
I got a warning letter from Suzanne
Ferber,

75
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:39,610
chair of the psychology department.
I'm a in the background,

76
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:42,130
David Cameron,
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and science.

77
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:44,320
Cheryl [inaudible],
vice president,

78
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,720
provost and Kelly,
Hannah Moffat,

79
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,660
vp hr and equity.
The person by the way,

80
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:54,661
who's now responsible for the mandatory
anti racism and anti-biased training

81
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,540
initiatives at the University of Toronto
and who has refused to disavow her

82
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,300
department's Association with the Black
Liberation Collective,

83
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:07,301
despite the fact that they,
they will not disavow violence in the

84
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:11,810
pursuit of their aims.
And in spite of the fact that two of the

85
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:14,630
people who produce,
who organized that particular

86
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:17,870
organization have a history of
misbehavior to put it,

87
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,990
um,
to put it mildly.

88
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:26,600
The letter said,
the initial initial letter said that,

89
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,250
I mean to me did not recognize the
rights of others to tell me which

90
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:33,260
personal pronoun to use when addressing
them.

91
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,440
And yes,
that is something I do not recognize.

92
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,870
It.
Do not recognize the rights of others to

93
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:41,780
tell anyone which personal pronoun to
use when addressing them.

94
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,990
I'm standing by that the UFT said that
was required to acceptance of their

95
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:50,660
statutorily protected right to equality
and equal treatment.

96
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,350
So now my failure to use,
um,

97
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,000
preferred pronouns like Zi answer or
whatever pronouns people want for that

98
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,440
matter is,
um,

99
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,180
is transgressing against their rights in
a,

100
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,730
in a manner that,
that appears to contravene the

101
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:10,400
legislation that,
that it's interesting that the

102
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:12,140
university warned me of that because of
course,

103
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:14,000
that's exactly why I made the video to
begin with.

104
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,090
The letter also said,
I do not accept that gender

105
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:19,730
identification can be independent of
biological sex.

106
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,370
The UFT said that was discriminatory as
well.

107
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,620
I did not say that.
And I informed the UFT that their letter

108
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:30,650
did not do a good job of actually I'm
accusing me if they didn't accuse me

109
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:31,850
properly of what I said.

110
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,730
And I offered to give them the letter
back so that they could write it

111
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:36,260
properly,
but they refused.

112
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:37,720
So,
um,

113
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,430
then it stands the way it stands.
So,

114
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,090
but we won't talk about that letter too
much because we muzzled talk about the

115
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,530
newer one.
So the consequences of,

116
00:07:47,531 --> 00:07:50,420
of what I did were crazy.
Really.

117
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,970
There were two demonstrations at the
University of Toronto.

118
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,070
The second one,
which was the free speech.

119
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,030
The first one was our demonstration
against me personally,

120
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:00,690
I would say,
um,

121
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,100
because of what I had dared to say.
And the second one was a free speech

122
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:07,160
rally that was organized by students.
I have nothing to do with it except that

123
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:09,260
I came to speak at it as did lauren
southern,

124
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,030
who's a journalist for rebel media that
has obtained massive online and youtube

125
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:16,940
coverage,
partly because lauren southern was the

126
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:20,450
victim of what appears to be an assault
at the free speech rally.

127
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,840
And that has now been viewed by,
I would think several million people.

128
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,730
It got what I did go mass and the
demonstrations and all of that got

129
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:31,100
massive traditional media coverage.
Uh,

130
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,820
the national,
the national radio in Canada,

131
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,440
uh,
the,

132
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,420
uh,
national TV,

133
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,780
all our major stations,
a huge number of newspapers,

134
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:44,170
columns,
op-eds,

135
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,210
all sorts of things.
So it's been one of the biggest stories

136
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:49,280
in Canada for the last 10 days,
I would say,

137
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,040
and massive online coverage as well.
Um,

138
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,830
and so I think the reason for that,
because,

139
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:58,740
you know,
I just sat in my office and made a video

140
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:01,530
about bill [inaudible] and complained
about political correctness,

141
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:03,810
but I did something different.
You see in this is what I think the

142
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:06,120
difference is,
is that people complain a lot about

143
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,980
political correctness but they never get
the tire to hit the road or are they

144
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:12,960
never hit the nail on the head with a
hammer.

145
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,540
See,
what I did was I said I don't like

146
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,600
political correctness and here's
something that I'm being required to do

147
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:21,450
by politically correct people and I will
not do it.

148
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,830
I won't do it,
period.

149
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:27,831
And I stand by that I am not going to
use made up pronouns to refer to people

150
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,890
if we sort this out linguistically in
the next 20 years.

151
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:34,980
And,
and we spontaneously come up with a term

152
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,660
that solves some of the problems with
gendered pronouns that perhaps we have.

153
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Although I'm not convinced that we have.
But if a spontaneous and I'm a and

154
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,260
consensus oriented decision is made
around the use of a new term,

155
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:55,420
then I'm willing to adopt it as well as,
as,

156
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,250
as much as the next person.
But I'm not having it forced on me and I

157
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:02,490
don't think anyone else should and I'm
not using the damn made up words by

158
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:04,860
radical left wing activists.
And that stopped.

159
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,600
So anyways,
I also got two letters from the

160
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:14,310
university.
I'm the first letter said you believe

161
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,860
that some of your commentary may be
illegal.

162
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,690
Yes,
I believe that that's why I made the

163
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:21,350
video because I don't think that the
sorts of things that I was saying should

164
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,420
be illegal in a free society.
I think it's unbelievably dangerous and

165
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:26,520
short sighted.
The letter said,

166
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:30,360
I must comply with the law including the
Ontario Human Rights Code.

167
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,090
Um,
and I must consider the impact of my

168
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,160
words and actions on my students and
colleagues.

169
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:38,370
While let me tell you this,
I considered the impact of my words and

170
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,640
actions on my students and colleagues
extraordinarily carefully.

171
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,050
Um,
I might say,

172
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:45,240
in fact,
I considered the impact of my words and

173
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:48,540
our actions far more carefully than did
the people who wrote these letters,

174
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,400
and I'm going to explain why I believe
that.

175
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,240
So the second letter,
which actually requested my silence,

176
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:59,000
the first one was more of a warning,
was signed by David Cameron,

177
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,790
dean of the Faculty of Arts and science,
and see a Ben Nelson,

178
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,310
vice president,
faculty and academic life.

179
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:07,460
And I read it in the previous video so
you can help post it as well,

180
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,060
so you can look at the details,
but I'm going to go over it more or less

181
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,790
topic by topic now.
I'm going to analyze it.

182
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,400
I'm going to deconstruct it.
That's what you might think for all you

183
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:19,830
postmodernists out there.
Here's an example of deconstruction in

184
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:22,040
action.
Okay.

185
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,520
So the first part of the,
the,

186
00:11:25,521 --> 00:11:29,390
uh,
letter detailed out essentially what the

187
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,750
University of Toronto understands to be
my comments and,

188
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:35,690
uh,
and the complaints the UFT has received.

189
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:41,410
Then the ut are outline their
hypothetical commitment to free speech.

190
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,070
I'm talking about my refusal to use
gender neutral pronouns.

191
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,440
Describe that refusal as illegal.
Um,

192
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,800
so,
so the letter first details out my

193
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,990
comments,
um,

194
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,600
you know,
discusses the fact that I made these

195
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,900
videos and then the states that,
um,

196
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,240
there are ongoing concerns about those
videos that have been expressed by a

197
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:18,940
variety of,
of groups and individuals at the

198
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:21,370
university.
The next part of the letter,

199
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,820
at least in principle details the
University of Toronto's commitment to

200
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:27,850
free speech.
Now I found this interesting and rather

201
00:12:27,851 --> 00:12:30,400
orwellian way,
George Orwell of course,

202
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,830
discussed the use of something he called
doublespeak,

203
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,770
which is to say one thing and mean
another or maybe mean precise out there.

204
00:12:39,771 --> 00:12:43,630
So in the letter that the second thing,
the University of Toronto does it stress

205
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:46,480
that it has a commitment to free speech,
but then of course,

206
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:50,830
later in the letter it decides that that
does not extend to its professor's

207
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:54,040
choosing their own pronouns.
So you can decide for yourself how deep

208
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,100
that commitment goes.
Um,

209
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,870
then they discussed that my refusal to
use gender neutral pronouns is,

210
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:03,910
um,
probably illegal.

211
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,830
Now,
there's a variety of ways of looking at

212
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:08,650
this.
One way of looking at it is that there

213
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:12,430
is a provision in the Ontario Human
Rights Code.

214
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,510
Yeah,
this is it,

215
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,160
that any act or thing done or admitted
to be done in the course of his or her

216
00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:24,360
employment by an officer or official
employee or agent of a corporation,

217
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:29,070
et cetera shall be deemed to be an act
or thing done or admitted to be done by

218
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:32,520
the corporation trade union trade or
Occupational Association,

219
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,370
Unincorporated Association or employer's
organization.

220
00:13:35,371 --> 00:13:38,910
So basically what that says,
that section 46 point three,

221
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:44,270
one of the human rights code is that if
you have an employee who says something

222
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,450
and it's not a good thing,
then you are responsible for it as if

223
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:51,030
you said it,
which is another part of the legislation

224
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:53,400
that I was actually complaining about it
in the initial videos.

225
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,350
And so the ot,
I think partly they wrote me this letter

226
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,550
maybe because they had a conversation
with their legal department and they

227
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:03,031
said,
well,

228
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:04,440
you know,
this professor might be right.

229
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,370
This could all be illegal.
Maybe it's even hate speech and if and

230
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,520
if he's doing it then because you're his
employer,

231
00:14:11,521 --> 00:14:15,090
you're also responsible for it.
So maybe that's part of the reason for

232
00:14:15,091 --> 00:14:16,860
the warning letter,
but anyways,

233
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,920
they've decided that my refusal to use
gender neutral pronouns is potential.

234
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,360
It's certainly discriminatory,
discriminatory,

235
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,760
as far as they're concerned and may also
be illegal,

236
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,760
which I would like to stress again,
was exactly why I made the videos to

237
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:31,620
begin with.
So it's not like they're reminding me of

238
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:35,910
something that I don't know.
So the next part of it was,

239
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,970
uh,
a discussion of distress in the

240
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,100
University of Toronto community.
They have received communications from

241
00:14:41,101 --> 00:14:45,960
individual students and employee groups
finding my comments unacceptable.

242
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,720
Emotionally disturbing and painful.
Um,

243
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,090
you know,
you can watch the videos yourself,

244
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,990
see if they're emotionally disturbing
and painful.

245
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,250
I might point out that if listening to
my comments is painful,

246
00:14:58,251 --> 00:15:01,430
then if you think that's painful,
then it's possible that nothing actually

247
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:02,910
painful has ever happened to you in my
life,

248
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,590
in your life.

249
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,300
Like I was thinking over the last couple
of weeks,

250
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,030
people have been asking me about how
stressful this is.

251
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,990
It's like,
well,

252
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:09,500
it's,
no,

253
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,540
it's no walk in the park,
I can tell you that,

254
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,030
but compared to something that's really
stressful,

255
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:17,000
like maybe a family member has cancer or
you know,

256
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:20,680
or that's a good one or,
or you're,

257
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,820
you've,
you've actually been thrown in jail by

258
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,920
an authoritarian society are being
tortured.

259
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:28,670
I mean this is not very stressful.
This is political dialogue and you know,

260
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:32,330
I would say that there was a week or two
there where I thought my job was

261
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,400
probably in danger and maybe it still
is,

262
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:38,480
but compared to a real pain,
real pain,

263
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,530
real suffering even that is,
I wouldn't call it trivial,

264
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:45,320
but it's not traumatic.
That's for sure.

265
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,360
Anyways,
the statements,

266
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:51,200
my statements and the invective that is
followed caused them to fear for their

267
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:54,890
safety and they become the target of
specific and violent threats.

268
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,890
Well,
I certainly think that threats directed

269
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:00,950
to people are reprehensible and I'm,
I'm not calling for that.

270
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:03,530
I'm calling for reasoned and articulate
debate,

271
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,230
but I would also like to point out,
and this is another part of the letter

272
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:09,710
that I seriously object to,
is that it would have been much better

273
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:11,570
had the University of Toronto written me
and said,

274
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,330
look,
we've received a whole variety of of

275
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:19,390
communications regarding your videos.
Some positive and supportive and some

276
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,110
critical and negative and having
carefully reviewed all of these.

277
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,920
We've decided that it would be in the
best interest of the university and

278
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:31,040
maybe in keeping with our policies and
the relevant laws.

279
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,530
If you stopped saying these sorts of
things that you're saying,

280
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:37,850
but that isn't what happened.
The letters select selectively omitted

281
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,290
to mention the fact that the University
of Toronto has received a petition that

282
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:47,291
has at least 5,000 signatures in support
of me and also several hundred letters,

283
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:52,520
which I know because I've been cc'd on
them and that it appears that the bulk

284
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:54,530
of public opinion is also on my side.

285
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,940
None of that was mentioned in the letter
and that also taught me how institutions

286
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:01,670
become corrupted when free speech is in
danger.

287
00:17:01,671 --> 00:17:04,100
Because,
and I've often wondered this because I

288
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:07,520
know that such things happened in the
Soviet Union where people over decades

289
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:11,150
swallowed very large lies and seems to
me that this is the way it happens.

290
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,520
Institution start writing letters that
are,

291
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,820
uh,
that contained sins of omission,

292
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:16,730
right?
The omit,

293
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:21,020
relevant information and that's and,
and present a very biased in one sided

294
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:23,990
view of an issue.
And then once that's written down,

295
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:28,100
it becomes the reality because one of
the things that psychologists do know is

296
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:30,710
that if you write down a set of
opinions,

297
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:34,190
those rapidly become your core beliefs
even if you don't think that you had

298
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:35,840
those beliefs before you wrote the
letter.

299
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,380
So and then of course the issue with the
threats.

300
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,100
That's a real interesting one because
when lauren southern was assaulted at

301
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:48,101
the u of t free speech rally and that
was captured on video and more than I

302
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:52,530
would maybe 2 million people have
watched that now the university didn't

303
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:55,050
say a thing about it in their public
communications.

304
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:59,320
But when there were threats,
rape threats made by some bone headed a

305
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,820
morons online.
And we don't know who these people were

306
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:04,800
by the way.
We don't know if they were trolls.

307
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:07,320
We don't know if,
if they were provocateurs,

308
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,830
we don't even know if they were the such
social justice warriors themselves.

309
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:13,560
And I wouldn't put it past them because
they've done that sort of thing in the

310
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:16,440
past.
So these were threats from unverified

311
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:20,370
sources that were posted online.
The university immediately sent out a

312
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,070
memo stating that,
you know,

313
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:26,430
an unsafe,
potentially unsafe atmosphere had been

314
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,890
produced on campus and that,
you know,

315
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,040
the university decries or as opposed to
all sorts of violent and aggressive

316
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:36,690
accent expressions.
They're up.

317
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,750
But they didn't send out the same memo
when,

318
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:42,090
when Lauren southern was assaulted at
the free speech rally.

319
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,410
And,
uh,

320
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,050
they also,
and this is particularly the case with

321
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:48,660
Kelly hand and moffit,
who's the human resources vice

322
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,610
president,
I informed her,

323
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:54,060
and many other people have that the
black liberation collective from whom

324
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:58,200
she's taking advice with regards to
antiracism training has,

325
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,370
is,
uh,

326
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:03,410
is the next best thing to a promoter of
violence in,

327
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,210
in,
in seeking social change according to

328
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:06,900
their website.

329
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,920
And is has,
is run or has been organized by two

330
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:15,921
women who have manifested in their
public behavior a number of things that

331
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:18,720
I think a reasonable person would regard
as reprehensible.

332
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,300
So that's another interesting thing is
that the bar,

333
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,730
the one sided reporting of what
constitutes a threat anyways,

334
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,540
they say that they trust that these
impacts were not my intention,

335
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,180
although they certainly implies strongly
that it's my fault.

336
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:36,720
And that's another thing I object to
because here's the thing to think about.

337
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,150
Imagine that there's a forest in front
of you and it's extremely dry.

338
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:44,550
It's extremely dry.
It's been a long hot summer,

339
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:49,080
or maybe it's been a drought and there's
a hot wind blowing and it's tinder dry.

340
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,040
And there's a lot of deadwood because
there hasn't been a fire for a very long

341
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,980
time.
And so the,

342
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,790
the conditions are poised for a
conflagration and someone comes along

343
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,760
and,
and uh,

344
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,060
produces a spark.

345
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,120
You can't blame the conflagration on the
spark.

346
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:11,060
Now I sparked this storm,
but that doesn't mean the deadwood

347
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,590
hadn't already gathered.
There's a lot of things that our society

348
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:17,730
needs to talk out and to lay.
The trouble that's emerged because of

349
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:19,650
these videos at my feet,
I think is a,

350
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,810
to call it an underhanded ploys is a,
is a very mild statement.

351
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,660
You know,
it's like Jordan Peterson is responsible

352
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:31,050
for this media storm about political
correctness is like,

353
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:35,970
I think I don't think so much as I might
like to take credit for it from a purely

354
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:40,080
egotistical perspective.
I'm the groundwork for all of this was

355
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:42,180
late,
well before I made my videos.

356
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,750
And the only reason I had they had the
effect they did is because I actually

357
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:47,910
said that there was something that the
pc,

358
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,520
uh,
thugs want me to do that I'm not going

359
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:52,060
to do.

360
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,110
So I drew a line and it happened to be
around issues of gender nomenclature,

361
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:58,840
but it could have been somewhere else.
And so of course,

362
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,030
because of that,
I've been,

363
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,610
um,
attacked in various ways

364
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,810
on the gender issue,
which is also a very important issue

365
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:09,370
which we need to discuss.
But,

366
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,560
you know,
it could have been in some way.

367
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:15,850
It could have been any other issue where
anybody else drew a line anyways.

368
00:21:15,851 --> 00:21:18,370
Then they request that I start repeating
these statements.

369
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,900
Okay,
so here we go.

370
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:25,560
I am not going to use made up pronouns
to refer to people at their whim.

371
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,960
I'm not doing it and I'm not going to be
silent either.

372
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,170
And that's that.
And then they remind me that I have an

373
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:36,040
obligation to uphold the law into
including the Ontario human rights code

374
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:39,250
and to deal fairly and ethically with
students.

375
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,413
Which,
um,

376
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,510
yeah,
well I knew that there might be a legal

377
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,850
issue and that's why I made the videos
to begin with.

378
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,870
So that hardly came as a surprise and I
actually think it's quite comical in a

379
00:21:49,871 --> 00:21:53,920
darkly ironic way that the university
itself is the institution that's

380
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:58,570
verifying my primary concern,
which was that making the video itself

381
00:21:58,571 --> 00:22:01,150
was likely illegal.
We need to think about that because

382
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:03,760
that's a bad thing.
It's a bad thing.

383
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:08,410
It shows you very clearly that freedom
of speech is under attack in Canada and

384
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,140
elsewhere of course as well.
And that's why there's been so much

385
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:14,890
international attention given to this is
the sequence of events.

386
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,040
So,
um,

387
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:22,390
they also suggest that this might
behavior undermines my ability to

388
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:25,090
conduct essential components of your job
as a faculty member.

389
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,070
I disagree with that.
Most of them mentally.

390
00:22:27,071 --> 00:22:31,360
My fundamental job as a faculty member
is to speak what I perceive to be the

391
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:32,020
truth.

392
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,900
And that doesn't mean I'm right and it
doesn't mean that I am speaking the

393
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:37,240
truth,
it's that I'm trying to speak the truth

394
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:40,570
and I'm also trying to listen to people
so that I can speak the truth more

395
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:42,820
carefully and I'm not going to stop
doing that.

396
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:46,390
And that does not undermine my ability
to conduct essential components of my

397
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:47,980
job as a faculty member.
In fact,

398
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:51,370
that is precisely and absolutely my job
as a faculty member.

399
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,570
And then of course to act consistent
with the law and university policy.

400
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:57,910
While we've already covered that,
I'm telling you,

401
00:22:57,911 --> 00:23:01,060
here we go.
I sat in the first video that making the

402
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:04,720
video was probably illegal and the
University of Toronto agrees with me or

403
00:23:04,721 --> 00:23:07,870
they wouldn't be warning me.
So we need to think about that and then

404
00:23:07,871 --> 00:23:11,140
there's a bit of hand waving about the
uft deploring acts of violence and the

405
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:12,430
disruption of civil debate.

406
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,720
Well,
they might deploy it,

407
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,350
but they didn't do anything about it and
they didn't even report on it when it

408
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:19,660
happened.
And so I think that their claims,

409
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:25,110
their fundamental claims to have a,
let's say peace and safety as their

410
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:29,830
primary concern and I'm not even sure
that should be the primary concern

411
00:23:29,831 --> 00:23:33,670
because truth trumps peace and safety.
I think that their actions,

412
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,460
you know,
the administration's actions do not

413
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:41,461
indicate a very clear commitment to
exactly to exactly the principles state

414
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,380
they claim to uphold.
So,

415
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,430
okay,
so what did I do about this?

416
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:47,420
Well,
here's what happened.

417
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,340
I went and meet,
met the Dean,

418
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,280
David Cameron on Friday.
I dropped in on him.

419
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,340
Um,
he was kind of nervous as far as I can

420
00:23:55,341 --> 00:23:56,570
tell.
He's an older guy.

421
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,480
I think he's a decent guy.
Um,

422
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,760
he listened to me.
I think we had a very productive

423
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:02,420
conversation.

424
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,260
I went through my concerns about the
letter and then what I suggested to him

425
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:10,070
was that the University of Toronto host
a series of debates,

426
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,580
a debate or a series of debates.
I would like to see three of them where

427
00:24:13,581 --> 00:24:15,950
we discussed such things as,
um,

428
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,120
the biological determination of gender
versus the environmental determination

429
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:24,470
of gender identity.
That would be a good debate.

430
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:28,550
We could have a debate on whether
Western society is an oppressive

431
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:31,100
patriarchy or an enlightened
civilization.

432
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,540
I'd like to have that debate.
And then the last debate would be

433
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,420
freedom of speech,
be something like freedom of speech

434
00:24:38,421 --> 00:24:41,900
versus social justice.
So that would be three topics I said we

435
00:24:41,901 --> 00:24:44,360
could have a civilized debate.
The university could host it,

436
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,180
um,
and we could sort these things out like

437
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:51,470
civilized human beings and maybe the
University of Toronto could be a beacon

438
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:52,670
on a hill,
so to speak,

439
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:53,840
which is what we should be.

440
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,110
And um,
maybe it would also help all the

441
00:24:57,111 --> 00:25:00,620
universities in the United States and in
the western world that are wrestling

442
00:25:00,621 --> 00:25:03,440
with these sorts of things,
clarify the issues and,

443
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,920
and move our society had in a productive
and peaceful way.

444
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:10,400
Because I thought about before I went
into the meeting with the Dean what the

445
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:13,850
best possible outcome could be and that
wouldn't be victory for me because I'm

446
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:17,360
not after victory for me.
I'm after truth and peace.

447
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:19,160
At least that's what I'm trying to be
after.

448
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,620
And so I thought,
and I discussed this with my and my

449
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:24,170
family,
what would be the best possible outcome?

450
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,660
And one,
you know,

451
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,330
one not good outcome would be the
entrenchment of the two positions into

452
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:34,331
increasingly rigid blocks and the
escalation of the situation in a

453
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:37,700
nonproductive way.
But then another productive way would be

454
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:39,560
to think of this as an opportunity and
say,

455
00:25:39,561 --> 00:25:41,510
look man,
we could have a real discussion at this

456
00:25:41,511 --> 00:25:42,344
university.

457
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:45,740
It's a great institution with shoulder
our damn responsibility.

458
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,680
We'll have a debate and will enlighten
ourselves and the public.

459
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,070
And so I'm going to meet with David
Cameron here in about half an hour and

460
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:55,160
I'm going to find out what the
university has to say about that.

461
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,710
So thanks very much for listening.
And I guess I'll close with this.

462
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,470
I would say to my fellow Canadian
citizens,

463
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,640
you guys better wake up,
you know the true north is no longer

464
00:26:07,641 --> 00:26:11,660
strong nor free as far as I can tell,
and are our rights to free speech are

465
00:26:11,661 --> 00:26:15,110
under assault and you better wake up
because it's not pretty and it's not

466
00:26:15,111 --> 00:26:17,510
good and it's happening a lot faster
than you think.

467
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,520
One of the things that happened on
Friday,

468
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,500
it was,
it was announced in the globe and Mail,

469
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,230
is that the liberal government,
the justice minister,

470
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:28,910
so to so called justice minister has
decided that to pick our judiciary,

471
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:31,670
which is one of the most important
things that can happen in a country.

472
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:36,110
The candidates for the judiciary now
will be required to produce a dossier

473
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:38,690
listing out their group identities,
race,

474
00:26:38,691 --> 00:26:39,830
religion,
sex,

475
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:40,760
gender,
identity,

476
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:44,640
gender expression and all the things
that differentiate us by group

477
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,390
membership.
And then the people who picked the

478
00:26:48,391 --> 00:26:53,391
judiciary are going to be subjected to
unconscious reeducation of their

479
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:57,210
unconscious,
so unconscious anti racism and anti bias

480
00:26:57,211 --> 00:27:00,660
training so that they don't,
so that they're not biased when they

481
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:04,860
review the candidates with the aim of
selecting candidates on the basis of

482
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:05,730
their identity,
which,

483
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,430
and I think there's nothing more racist
than that period.

484
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,330
And so that almost passed unnoticed.
And I would say with regards to

485
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,660
unconscious bias training,
first of all,

486
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:17,880
we can't measure unconscious bias very
well.

487
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,240
This is all the implicit association
test and you can look that up.

488
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,180
We can't measure that very well because
the test isn't very reliable.

489
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,980
It was never intended to be used to
document individual's unconscious bias.

490
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,660
But that's where this idea has come
from.

491
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,600
Um,
there's huge debate on what that bias

492
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:34,201
means.
Like,

493
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:37,230
I don't believe it.
I don't believe that it means what the,

494
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,170
what the proponents of unconscious
racial bias say.

495
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:42,240
It means the science is far from
settled.

496
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:45,300
And I mean far from settled.
It's a serious topic of discussion.

497
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,513
And,
and,

498
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,840
and then to educate people out of their
unconscious biases.

499
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,870
Man,
that's an Orwellian thing,

500
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,120
you know,
it's one thing to pete controls people's

501
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:56,670
speech that's bad enough,
especially when you start controlling

502
00:27:56,671 --> 00:27:58,650
what they can say instead of what they
can say,

503
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,010
but then to go after their unconscious
minds and then to make that a

504
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:04,920
precondition for the panels that select
our judiciary,

505
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,830
it's like this isn't good,
this isn't good.

506
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,970
And I'm speaking as a psychologist and a
student of authoritarianism and

507
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:15,540
political psychopathology.
So wake up,

508
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,750
this isn't good.
Do something about it.

509
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,580
And I've got a website started that I,
that I'm where I'm going to post things

510
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:24,630
that people can do.
So.

511
00:28:24,631 --> 00:28:26,550
But that'll,
that'll happen later in the week.

512
00:28:26,551 --> 00:28:28,530
So anyways,
thanks for listening.

513
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,140
That's all I've got to say for now.
Bye.

514
00:28:31,141 --> 00:28:31,440
Bye.
