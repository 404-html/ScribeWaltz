1
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,003
Hello.
So you've lined up a very large number 

2
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:17,540
of questions today.
So a couple of things.

3
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,170
First of all,
I have a number of

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,140
youtube videos and podcasts lined up.
One with Steven Pinker,

5
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,263
author of enlightenment.
Now one was Warren Farrell who wrote a 

6
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:35,194
very interesting book called the boy 
crisis and also a previous book called 

7
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:42,070
why men earn more,
um,

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,830
one with an animator named Nina Paley,
uh,

9
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,423
one with a young guy named Charlie Kirk 
who has organized a large number of 

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,113
campus youth groups,
more on the conservative end of things 

11
00:00:56,981 --> 00:00:57,814
and associated with freewill.
So all those will be coming out in the 

12
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:02,471
next month and a half,
I would say.

13
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:05,260
And so thank you for your continued 
support.

14
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,340
It makes all of this possible.
And uh,

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,753
I'm also going on tour.
I presume some of you know that if you 

16
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:16,210
go to Jordan beat peterson.com and you 
look up events,

17
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:19,630
you can see where it's about 40 cities 
listed so far.

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,320
Most of them are in us and a couple in 
Europe,

19
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,150
Iceland,
the UK.

20
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,573
Um,
but we're announcing we're going to 

21
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:31,300
announce 10 Canadian cities here in the 
next week as well.

22
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,033
So that's all what's going to be 
happening with me in the next two 

23
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:40,240
months.
So I'll be on the road with my wife that

24
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:42,520
whole time,
sometimes in a plane,

25
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,770
you know,
just commercial travel,

26
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,700
sometimes in a motorhome,
depending on where we're going and how,

27
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,510
so I'm looking forward to seeing you if 
you come out to the events.

28
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,613
I've been enjoying them quite a bit.
It's good to be able to talk to so many 

29
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:58,390
people.
So,

30
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,373
um,
12 rules for life as sold about a 

31
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,180
million copies now.
So that's really quite something.

32
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:08,020
And I think we've sold foreign rights in
43 countries,

33
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,350
so it'll come out in not quite that many
languages,

34
00:02:11,351 --> 00:02:13,840
but just about over the next year and a 
half,

35
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,300
something like that.
So.

36
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,540
All right,
so you,

37
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,423
let's get at it here.
Hopefully I could warm up and get my 

38
00:02:19,871 --> 00:02:22,360
brain going and,
and answer some questions.

39
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,350
The first one,
343 people have voted this one up.

40
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,783
Um,
could you please discuss freewill and 

41
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:33,100
Sam Harris's and others' ideas of it's 
non nonexistence.

42
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,950
Well that's a good complicated question 
to kick things off.

43
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:40,170
So I want to tell you a little bit about
how to conceptualize freewill.

44
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,180
I think first because it's obvious that 
we don't have infinite free will are our

45
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,460
choice,
our choices are constrained in all sorts

46
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:49,294
of ways.
And I think part of the reason that 

47
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:51,244
there's a,
a continual discussion about freewill 

48
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:58,150
and the philosophical and the 
philosophical literature is because

49
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,850
just conceptualizing the issue properly 
is extraordinarily difficult.

50
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:07,090
So I like to think about it at least in 
part,

51
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,850
the way that you think about a game.
You know,

52
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,760
if you're playing a game,
obviously the game has rules.

53
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:15,040
So if it's a chess game or a basketball 
game,

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,880
then there are things that you can do in
and things that you can't do.

55
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,440
And but,
and so it,

56
00:03:21,441 --> 00:03:22,360
it's a,
it's a,

57
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,433
it's a closed world in some sense.
But the fact that there are things you 

58
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:28,384
can't do when you play a game also seem 
to open up a universe of possibilities 

59
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:32,704
for things that you can do.
So chess obviously constraints you to a 

60
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:40,390
board and to a certain number of men and
to a certain pattern of rules.

61
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,810
But the strange thing is,
is that when you put in those rules,

62
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:44,644
because rules sound like limits,
they sound always like things you can't 

63
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:47,794
do.
But when you set up a constrained world 

64
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:52,810
like that and you lay out a system of 
rules,

65
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:57,280
what you do is open up an infinity of,
of a near infinity of possibilities.

66
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,630
Same with music.
You know,

67
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:01,070
music has rules obviously,
and,

68
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,600
and if you follow the rules,
then you can make an infinite variety of

69
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:05,434
music.

70
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,050
And so,
and so there's a,

71
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:08,884
there's a very interesting dynamic 
that's hard to understand between 

72
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:12,664
constraint and possibility.
And there's a deep idea that's 

73
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:18,790
associated with that that I read in some
Jewish commentary on,

74
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,270
on the biblical stories that I,
I read a long time ago.

75
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,260
I'm talking about the relationship 
between God and man.

76
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:30,660
And the idea was that God,
imagine,

77
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:31,494
uh,
being with the classical attributes of 

78
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:33,940
God,
omniscience,

79
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,490
omnipotence and omnipresence,
all seeing,

80
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:39,970
all knowing and all powerful.
What is it being like that lack,

81
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,580
and obviously the answer is nothing,
right?

82
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:47,581
Because by definition those three traits
provide for absence of limitation.

83
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:51,880
But then that's exactly what's lacking 
is limitation.

84
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,950
And there's some strange connection 
between limitation and,

85
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:56,843
and I was saying say limitation that 
that's rule governed as I mentioned 

86
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:03,190
before,
and the opening up of possibility.

87
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,610
So it isn't necessarily the case that 
now determine determinism and limitation

88
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:09,604
aren't exactly the same thing,
but they're analogous and they need to 

89
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:12,250
be discussed together.

90
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,353
Okay,
so now,

91
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,600
so that's the first thing is that our,
whatever our free choice is,

92
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:19,810
it isn't limited,
it's or it's limited.

93
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,600
It's deeply limited.
Now here's another thing.

94
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,770
If I take my arm and I go like this,
see,

95
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,520
I'll do that again.
Now you see there's a movement like that

96
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,390
and then my hand stopped just before my,
my other hand.

97
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,643
Now it takes a certain amount of time 
for the neural messages to go from my 

98
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:44,170
brain to my arm and back.
And the time it takes my hand to go like

99
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:48,820
this and stop is actually shorter than 
the time it takes a message to get to my

100
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:51,520
brain and back.
So what that means is that when I,

101
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,660
when I planned this movement,
which is called a ballistic movement,

102
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,950
it's called a ballistic movement.
It's like a bullet.

103
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,510
Once you let it go,
it's gone.

104
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,500
There's no calling back.
I've actually organized the neurological

105
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:07,850
and muscular sequences that enabled that
action before it's implemented.

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,320
I set all that up and then it's released
and the whole thing cascades.

107
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:16,640
And so once the action has been 
released,

108
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:17,474
let's say,
then I don't really have any freewill 

109
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,680
because I can't stop it now.
So,

110
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,633
so you think about that,
it looks like there's a temporal 

111
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:25,064
gradient with regards to freewill.
Is that as you look out into the future 

112
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,850
meet perhaps the farther out you look 
into the future,

113
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,310
um,
the farther down the road,

114
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,370
let's say the more free your choices 
are,

115
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:39,350
but the closer they get to 
implementation,

116
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:40,184
the more they become deterministic 
governed by standard cause a processes 

117
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:45,284
and there's some transition point where 
they change from being what we would 

118
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:52,130
describe as choice that we haven't got 
to free choice yet,

119
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:53,150
but at least to choice.

120
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,450
There's some transition point between 
now and ballistic movement.

121
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,060
Here's another way of thinking about it.
Like we know for example,

122
00:06:59,061 --> 00:06:59,894
that people who are expert at playing 
the piano look ahead of where they're 

123
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:07,100
playing and,
and they're doing the same thing.

124
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:09,560
They're watching the notes,
they're seeing where they're going,

125
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,290
but,
and then their disinhibiting,

126
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,124
the automated structures that enable 
them to play what they've practiced so 

127
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:18,290
thoroughly.
They're disinhibited.

128
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,080
Those structures.
And then they go automatically.

129
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,153
And then what happens if you make a 
mistake is that consciousness notes the 

130
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:25,664
error and then unpacks the motor 
sequences that have been practiced and 

131
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:30,494
then you read,
practice them and sequence them again 

132
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,950
until they become automatic.
And deterministic.

133
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,520
So there's choice in that you're reading
ahead,

134
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,880
but there's no choice in that.
Once you've read ahead in disinhibited,

135
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:42,770
the auctions,
then they run ballistically.

136
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,053
And then you can think about the same 
thing that's happening when you're 

137
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:46,670
driving in a car.

138
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:47,803
You don't look right in front of you 
when you're driving a car because 

139
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,360
whatever is right in front of you,
if you're going 40 miles an hour,

140
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:54,194
whatever you've already run over,
you look a quarter of a mile down the 

141
00:07:57,381 --> 00:07:58,214
road.
And that gives you the opportunity to 

142
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:04,160
see what's coming.
And to set up a sequence of increasingly

143
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:04,994
automated movements that culminate in 
whatever it is that you're doing while 

144
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:08,594
you're driving.
And so there's a gradation from choice 

145
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:13,820
to determinism,
a temporal gradation.

146
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,210
And,
and I,

147
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:18,420
I don't often see that addressed when 
people talk about free will.

148
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,603
And now Sam's issue with freewill is 
that if you get someone to do something 

149
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:25,094
like lift their finger and you,
and you scan their brains using a 

150
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:31,550
variety of techniques while they're 
doing that,

151
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,110
what you'll see is that there's an 
action potential that emerge and you ask

152
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:37,610
them to voluntarily move their fingers.

153
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,770
So they're doing it,
let's say by free choice,

154
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,650
there's an action potential that you 
can,

155
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,663
that you can read off the brain that 
occurs before the person either moves 

156
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:50,450
their finger or let's say decides to 
move their finger.

157
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,523
And that occurs quite a bit before the 
feeling of volunteerism or that 

158
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,793
voluntary act.
And so that's been read by Benjamin 

159
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,570
Libet who did the experiments,
um,

160
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,340
as indication that even the feeling of 
voluntary choices determined.

161
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,183
But I don't think that that's a very 
useful way of addressing the issue 

162
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:11,784
because the issue of when you lift your 
finger in up again is it requires 

163
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:20,310
pre-programming to disinhibit.
Like you know how to do this right?

164
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,593
You don't have to learn to do that.
So you have a little automated circuit 

165
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:24,564
that does this sort of thing.
All these finger movements and 

166
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:26,904
everything,
you can see babies practicing them and 

167
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:32,880
they develop automated circuitry that 
tends to be posterior left hemisphere in

168
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:36,300
order to run those,
those automated processes out.

169
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,373
And what you're basically doing when you
decide to do something that's a routine 

170
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:41,754
that you've already practiced or,
or made out of sub routines that you've 

171
00:09:43,831 --> 00:09:47,500
already practiced is disinhibiting them.
And the,

172
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,343
the degree to which you might regard 
that as free exactly is unclear as are 

173
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:56,040
the temporal limitations.
So I don't think that limits experiments

174
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,173
demonstrate conclusively that there's no
such thing as free will even though 

175
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:00,624
there are action potentials that 
indicate that there is brain activity 

176
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:06,630
signaling,
even the onset of a voluntary choice,

177
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,900
um,
voluntary choice early.

178
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,320
Now,
um,

179
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,810
another thing that we might look at in 
relationship to that is,

180
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,430
um,
yeah,

181
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,140
so we can look at it phenomenologically 
and we could also look at it in,

182
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,263
in,
in relationship to how people treat one 

183
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,374
another.
So phenomenologically it seems clear 

184
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:28,974
that we have free choice and it isn't 
obvious to me why we have consciousness 

185
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:33,540
if free choice isn't real.

186
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,583
Cause consciousness looks to me like a 
mechanism that deals with potential 

187
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:40,890
before it's transformed into actuality,
let's say.

188
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,670
And,
and I think consciousness is also the,

189
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,500
the faculty,
so to speak,

190
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:47,334
or a manifestation of the faculty that 
enables us to preprogram deterministic 

191
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:52,290
actions.
So again,

192
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,940
let's think about someone playing the 
piano.

193
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,510
They're practicing,
you know,

194
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:59,070
after you repeat and you repeat your,
your finger movements,

195
00:10:59,071 --> 00:11:01,590
if you're playing the piano,
any complex motor skill is like that.

196
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:03,810
You have to repeat it and repeat it and 
repeat it and repeat it.

197
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,840
And you're using consciousness to 
program it,

198
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:09,870
to sequence the motor movements and to 
pay attention to them.

199
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,370
That all seems voluntary and it involves
the activation of a tremendous amount of

200
00:11:14,371 --> 00:11:16,200
your brain.
Because if you're doing something new,

201
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,770
a lot of your brain is activated.
And then as you practice it,

202
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,850
the amount of brain that's activated 
decreases.

203
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:24,684
It shifts from right to left.
And then it shifts from frontal to 

204
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,120
posterior and a smaller and smaller 
area.

205
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:31,954
So what's happening is that 
consciousness is creating little 

206
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:37,980
machines in the back of your head that 
do things in an automated manner.

207
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,323
And

208
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,293
the,
the,

209
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,223
the volume that consciousness looks like
consciousness appears and feels that 

210
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:50,024
would be the phenomenological and as if 
it's doing that voluntarily and it is 

211
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,180
associated with a different pattern of 
brain activity.

212
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,310
And so,
okay,

213
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,144
so there's that,
there's the fund long phenomenological 

214
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,280
reality of voluntary choice and effort 
as well.

215
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:06,010
Cause conscious programming of that sort
is also effortful.

216
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:08,800
It doesn't seem to run deterministically
like a clock does.

217
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,400
And then finally,
there's also,

218
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,510
and I don't know what you think about 
this with regards to evidence,

219
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,463
but what constitutes evidence is not 
always that easy to determine even in 

220
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,220
the scientific domain.
So imagine,

221
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:24,903
think about how we think about ourselves
and other people and how we treat 

222
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:28,354
ourselves and other people.
You could imagine that you're like a 

223
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:34,420
clock running down and that's like a 
deterministic model.

224
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,850
But people aren't,
clocks were dissipative structures.

225
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,510
A clock is something that runs downhill.
But human beings,

226
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,243
you can look up dissipative structure.
I think that was an idea that was first 

227
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,880
formulated by the physicist.
Schrodinger we,

228
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,251
we're,
we're,

229
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:52,084
we're not,
we're not clocks by any stretch of the 

230
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:54,364
imagination.
And we take energy in and we disperse 

231
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:57,934
energy and,
and we were anti entropic in an in a 

232
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:02,434
temporary sense.
So that makes us and and so and life is 

233
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,590
as well shorting a wrote about that in a
book called what is life and

234
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,870
we don't what we seem to do,
this is how it looks to me.

235
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,580
We don't contend with the present and 
we're not driven by the past.

236
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,623
Instead what we see in front of us is a 
landscape of possibility and my wilder 

237
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:25,984
moments,
I think that's associated with the 

238
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:31,060
physical idea of multiple universes.
But that's in my wilder moments.

239
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,893
It's just a speculation.
And so what we see in front of us is an 

240
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:35,674
array of potential universes.
And those are the universes that we 

241
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:41,800
could bring about as a consequence of 
our actions and it,

242
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,350
and we make choices to the right or the 
left.

243
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,213
There's a lot of mythological 
speculation about that sort of idea to 

244
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,683
in an ethical sense,
cause we decide what sort of reality 

245
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:52,264
that we want to bring into being.
And so we encounter potential like God 

246
00:13:55,721 --> 00:14:00,721
did at the beginning of time when he 
made order out of chaos.

247
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,593
Chaos is this chaotic potential.
We confront chaotic potential with our 

248
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:09,181
consciousness and we cast that into 
reality and that now then you think,

249
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:10,744
well is that really the case?
Well that's hard to say because there 

250
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:17,740
are limits to our knowledge about 
consciousness and about reality.

251
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:18,574
But if you treat yourself like you're a 
free moral agent with choice and that 

252
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:24,820
you can determine the course of your 
life,

253
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:25,923
then you seem to get along better with 
yourself and to be less anxious and to 

254
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:29,680
be more productive.

255
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,700
And if you treat other people like that,
that they're free agents that are making

256
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:34,534
voluntary choices about how reality is 
going to come into being and you reward 

257
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:40,570
them when they do it properly and you 
punish them,

258
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,953
uh,
or otherwise discipline them when they 

259
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:44,770
don't,
when they do it badly,

260
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,010
then your relationships with them seem 
to work.

261
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:48,844
And then if we predicate our society on 
the presupposition that each individual 

262
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:56,120
human being is capable of doing just 
that,

263
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,060
then we seem to have extremely 
functional societies.

264
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,343
And so,
and this is something that Sam Harris 

265
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:06,020
has been taken to task for many times,
is if you dispense with the idea of free

266
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:09,620
will,
how is it you organize your relationship

267
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:10,454
to yourself,
your interactions with your family and 

268
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:15,200
your relationships with the broader 
social community?

269
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,123
It's a very complicated issue.
So I believe strongly that we have free 

270
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,140
will,
that we're responsible for our choices.

271
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,230
Those choices are constrained in many,
many ways.

272
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,483
I think there's a gradient of freewill 
from free out into the future to 

273
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:34,154
increasingly constrained as the present 
manifest itself to deterministic in the 

274
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:41,640
moment when,
when in the moment of action we,

275
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:42,474
and you might think that we entered the 
realm of deterministic causality at the 

276
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:47,240
moment of action,
something like that.

277
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,820
That's how it looks to me.
So.

278
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,313
Well,
so at this rate we're going to answer 

279
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:54,890
about five questions so that,
but that was a very,

280
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:56,420
very hard one.
So anyways,

281
00:15:56,421 --> 00:15:59,300
I hope that's helpful.
Maelstrom.

282
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,210
Who is apparently chaos given the name 
asks me,

283
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,360
am I chaos or am I order?
Well,

284
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:08,750
that's a good question.
I would say a lot of the time I'm chaos,

285
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,270
but I do everything I can to put things 
in order.

286
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,930
Um,
but I'm going to answer that in a deeper

287
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:15,590
way.

288
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,930
I would say,
because first of all,

289
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,530
everything and everyone is chaos and 
order at the same time.

290
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,490
And I don't mean that in a trait sense.
I mean in a technical sense,

291
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:26,324
which is order.
Technically speaking in my way of 

292
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:29,984
viewing the world is order is that 
domain you inhabit when what you're 

293
00:16:33,261 --> 00:16:36,140
doing produces the results that you want
to have happen.

294
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,250
That's a pragmatic perspective from,
from a philosophical perspective,

295
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:41,084
it's derived at least in part or as 
analogous to the pragmatism of people 

296
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,170
like,
um,

297
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,700
um,
cs purse and William James,

298
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,760
the American pr,
the early American pragmatists.

299
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:53,963
Um,
and there's a great book on all that if 

300
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:58,700
you're interested,
called the metaphysical club.

301
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,273
Um,
so order is where you are when what 

302
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:04,184
you're doing is producing the results 
that you intended and that validates 

303
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:07,670
what you're doing.
By the way,

304
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:09,380
that that's a pragmatic form of truth.

305
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,650
Your theory is accurate when if you 
enact it,

306
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:13,663
then the results that you intend emerge.
That's the definition of truth from a 

307
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:17,624
pragmatic perspective to have very 
powerful definition and it's very much 

308
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:22,610
associated with the Darwinian notion of 
truth.

309
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,880
So that's worth,
that's worth looking into.

310
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,283
Now obviously there are times when you 
implement a plan and a and at world 

311
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,400
conception that goes along with that 
plan and what you wanted didn't happen.

312
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,790
And so then the domain of chaos comes 
up,

313
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:41,624
the domain of the unpredictable and 
unexpected and you have to contend with 

314
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:47,090
it.
And sometimes when you are acting,

315
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,043
you do perverse things and things that 
that surprise you and then things don't 

316
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,720
work out well for you.
Or,

317
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,230
or maybe you get a surprise and maybe 
sometimes that might even be positive.

318
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,303
And that's because the chaos within you 
as manifested itself and you've done 

319
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:05,040
something that exceeds the bounds of 
your understanding.

320
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,383
And you know,
that can happen to people so badly that 

321
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:11,400
they developed post traumatic stress,
post traumatic stress disorder.

322
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,850
Sometimes soldiers,
especially naive young soldiers,

323
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:15,684
will go on a battlefield and watched 
themselves do something they can't 

324
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:18,384
imagine they're capable of doing and 
then they have permanent post traumatic 

325
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:21,684
stress disorder.
So there's a chaos within that can 

326
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,660
manifest itself,
that can disrupt whatever order you are.

327
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,813
Um,
and you know that minor ways because 

328
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:33,060
everybody's always running around doing 
things that aren't good for them,

329
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:35,580
that they know they shouldn't do and 
that they can't control.

330
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,600
And so there's a chaotic and an orderly 
aspect to everything,

331
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,120
to the individual,
to the family,

332
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,040
to the social world,
to the natural world.

333
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,790
It's chaos and order at every level of 
analysis simultaneously,

334
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,940
which is why the Dallas think of the 
world is made out of Yin and Yang,

335
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:51,774
which is essentially
analogous to the idea of order and 

336
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:55,764
chaos.

337
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,040
And now,
but then there's another element too.

338
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:03,060
So your order and your chaos and w the 
place that you live,

339
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:05,250
the environment is order and chaos as 
well.

340
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,270
But you're also the process that 
mediates between the two.

341
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,493
And what that means is you're the forest
that confronts chaos and cast it into 

342
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:14,274
order.
We talked about that in the freewill 

343
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:18,210
discussion.
That's the basis for the dragon math,

344
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:19,800
or at least part of it,
the hero myth.

345
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,910
You're the forest that confronts chaos 
and transforms it into habitable order.

346
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,360
And there's an idea that if you do that 
using truthful speech,

347
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,430
it's probably the deepest idea in the 
Bible.

348
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,990
If you confront chaos and the unknown 
using truthful speech,

349
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:34,824
then the order that you produce is good.
So that also means that your chaos and 

350
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:42,900
order and the process that intermediates
between them,

351
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,150
and that's really the basis of the hero 
myth.

352
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,540
So part of that is the hero story and 
the Dragon Myth.

353
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,670
Go Out,
confront the drag and get the gold,

354
00:19:50,671 --> 00:19:52,590
bring it back,
share it with the community.

355
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,990
And the dragon is a representation of 
that which dwells beyond the confines of

356
00:19:57,991 --> 00:20:00,330
the safe and habitable space,
right?

357
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:02,970
It's an image of a predator.
That's part of what it is.

358
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:04,710
Although it's way more complicated than 
that.

359
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,323
And you're also the forest that 
confronts order when it becomes too 

360
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:09,444
tyrannical and restructures it back to 
chaos and then restructures the chaos 

361
00:20:14,311 --> 00:20:17,010
back into more beneficial order,
which is what you do.

362
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:17,844
For example,
if you have an argument with someone 

363
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:21,000
that you settle,
right?

364
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:24,340
Cause the argument takes the orderly,
um,

365
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,590
relation that you have with that person 
and then produces a chaotic interlude,

366
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:30,990
which is all the pain that's associated 
with the argument.

367
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,760
And that's a dissolution into what 
Murcia Ellie Audi called pre cosmic gone

368
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:36,594
to chaos.

369
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,910
And out of that,
a new order can emerge.

370
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,070
And so the best way to construe yourself
is not as chaos or as order,

371
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,740
but as the process that mediates between
the,

372
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:52,120
and that's the basis for the ethos of 
the West is that the human being is best

373
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,493
represented as the individual and the 
individual is that attentive and 

374
00:20:57,521 --> 00:20:58,354
communicative entity that is continually
capable of mediating properly between 

375
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:06,160
chaos and order.
Now this is a deep idea.

376
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,310
You could read maps of meaning if you 
would like.

377
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,130
The audio version of that is coming out 
June 12th,

378
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:12,964
by the way.
And I will make a video detailing the 

379
00:21:14,471 --> 00:21:17,350
relationship between maps of meaning and
12 rules of life.

380
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,633
But you can construe yourself,
you should construe yourself as the 

381
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:24,130
process that mediates between chaos and 
order.

382
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,323
And you should aim to be the process 
that does that properly using truthful 

383
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,943
communication because that's how you 
keep the elements of existence properly 

384
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:34,300
balanced.

385
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,170
And you might say,
yeah,

386
00:21:35,171 --> 00:21:37,270
but is that real?
Well,

387
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,823
if you read maps of meaning,
there's a section on neuropsychology 

388
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,670
that's also buttressed by a book written
by Ian Mcgilchrist called the master and

389
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,504
his emissary that lays out the 
relationship between the right and left 

390
00:21:49,331 --> 00:21:50,164
hand Miss Hemisphere.
Now it's quite strange that we have a 

391
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:53,254
right and left hemisphere.
It's almost as if we have two 

392
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:58,030
consciousnesses dwelling in our,
in our,

393
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,620
in our,
in our being.

394
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,570
Um,
and they're quite separable.

395
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,910
If you cut the Corpus callosum that 
unites the two,

396
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:06,880
then the two hemispheres will act 
independently to some degree.

397
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:09,280
You can communicate with each of them 
somewhat independently.

398
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,470
So they actually view the world quite 
differently.

399
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:15,310
And that that hemisphere distinction is 
not only they're in human beings,

400
00:22:15,311 --> 00:22:17,980
but also an animals along way down the 
phylogenetic chain.

401
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,143
Now,
I made the claim partly because I was 

402
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:25,771
reading a man named El Conan Goldberg,
who was a student of Alexander Luria,

403
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,570
the most brilliant neuro psychologist of
the 20th century.

404
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,480
And,
and Goldberg made the case that,

405
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:35,470
um,
the left hemisphere is specialized for,

406
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,960
um,
for what's known.

407
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:38,794
And the right hemisphere is specialized 
for anomaly and [inaudible] 

408
00:22:41,421 --> 00:22:43,450
Rameshchandra and who's a famous 
neurologist.

409
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,060
I'm an MD in,
in California,

410
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:46,894
has also made it very similar claim 
based on his analysis of brain damaged 

411
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,613
individuals.
But Goldberg's case was the left 

412
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:54,700
hemisphere is specialized for what you 
know,

413
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:55,534
how to do.
And the right hemisphere is specialized 

414
00:22:57,431 --> 00:23:02,431
for response to what's unknown and that 
maps onto this order chaos dimension,

415
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,960
right,
and the right hemisphere.

416
00:23:04,961 --> 00:23:06,070
Now,
um,

417
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,353
mcgilchrist in his book,
the master and his emissary has pointed 

418
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:12,790
out quite clearly that the left 
hemisphere has a tyrannical tendency,

419
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:17,680
which Rameshchandra and also viewed in 
his brain damaged patients by the way,

420
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,740
and that the left hemisphere is always 
trying to impose.

421
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,070
It's logical and restricted order on the
world.

422
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:25,990
And to make the world fit into that.

423
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,090
Now it has to do that.
There's reasons for that.

424
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,763
Part of the reason is,
is that if your theory you've worked on 

425
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:34,930
for 10 years makes one prediction era,
you shouldn't throw the whole damn thing

426
00:23:34,931 --> 00:23:37,390
out.
You should doubt the prediction error,

427
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,463
right?
Cause you never know when your data is 

428
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:42,580
actually data or is just another kind of
theory.

429
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:45,410
We can't get into that at the moment.
Now,

430
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,783
um,
mcgilchrist makes it very strong case 

431
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:52,730
and I think in a more elaborated case 
than I made in maps of meaning.

432
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:53,564
But it's the same argument fundamentally
that the right hemisphere is concerned 

433
00:23:58,011 --> 00:24:00,110
with reaction to anomaly.
And so,

434
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,003
so what happens in some senses something
unexpected happens that's the domain of 

435
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:07,010
chaos.
And that stops you in your tracks,

436
00:24:07,011 --> 00:24:09,110
it freezes you.
And that's a Predator response.

437
00:24:09,111 --> 00:24:10,490
A prey response.
Actually,

438
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,340
you're frozen,
the unknown has manifested itself.

439
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,383
You're not in order anymore.
You don't know where you are and you 

440
00:24:16,551 --> 00:24:17,930
don't know what to do.
And so,

441
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:19,970
and you can't just shut down like a 
computer does.

442
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,893
You freeze instead.
And then what happens is that the 

443
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:24,224
ancient mechanisms that have helped our 
ancestors for tens of millions of years 

444
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:28,484
or perhaps longer than that,
react to that which lurks beyond the 

445
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:35,060
confines of the unknown kick in.
And you start,

446
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:35,894
first of all that's motoric.
So you freeze and then you cautiously 

447
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:40,700
start to explore and then it's 
imagistic.

448
00:24:40,701 --> 00:24:43,190
You start making imaginal 
representations,

449
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,323
metaphoric representations,
dramatic representations of what might 

450
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:48,014
constitute the unknown.
And then those representations are 

451
00:24:50,931 --> 00:24:51,764
practiced and implemented in the world 
and they become more and more fine 

452
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:57,260
grained and automatized.
And as that happens,

453
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,370
the locale that they're represented in 
the brain shifts from right to left.

454
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,860
So,
so,

455
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:07,250
so the reason I'm telling you all this 
is because you know,

456
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,920
this is where the metaphysical and the 
physical unite,

457
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:10,754
and this is the sort of argument that I 
was trying to make to Sam Harris and 

458
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:15,890
hopefully we'll be able to continue 
doing that because I'm going to meet him

459
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,330
three times in the next few months.

460
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:21,050
Is that the,
the Yin Yang idea,

461
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:21,884
the chaos order ideas,
metaphorical in some sense to say that 

462
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:25,094
the world is made up of order and chaos 
doesn't sound like an empirical 

463
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:29,690
statement,
but strangely enough,

464
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,943
the world to which our brains are 
adapted is actually the world of chaos 

465
00:25:35,211 --> 00:25:37,220
and order.
You can think about it as unexplored,

466
00:25:37,221 --> 00:25:39,110
unexplored territory too.
That's another,

467
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,140
that's another,
you know,

468
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:41,683
take on it.
And so then you think from a Darwinian 

469
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:45,860
perspective,
think about it this way.

470
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,650
From a Darwinian perspective,
there's an,

471
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,753
there's an an axiomatic presupposition,
and that is reality is that which 

472
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:55,580
selects,
okay,

473
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:58,760
reality is the force that selects over 
evolutionary time.

474
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,223
And so the forest that selects over 
evolutionary time has selected for 

475
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:07,010
hemispheric specialization,
bilateral hemispheric specialization,

476
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,173
which indicates the two different modes 
of looking at the world are necessary 

477
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,710
for survival,
right?

478
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:13,544
So that's real.
And so the idea that the world is made 

479
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,800
out of chaos and order is perhaps the 
most real idea.

480
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:19,783
Now,
here's something else cool that's 

481
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:24,500
associated with that.
And this is an antidote to nihilism.

482
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,490
I also think it's an antidote to two.
What would you call 'em?

483
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,460
Ideological,
ideological possession.

484
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,593
So when you encounter something unknown,
you orient towards it and that's an 

485
00:26:36,831 --> 00:26:37,664
involuntary response.
You could even think about it as a 

486
00:26:39,301 --> 00:26:40,134
deterministic response.
It's part of what orients you very 

487
00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:45,780
rapidly towards predators.
So they don't kill you before you have a

488
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:47,460
chance to respond.
Okay,

489
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:50,580
so you react because the normalist thing
is meaningful,

490
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:51,414
it's intrinsically meaningful.
And the reaction is first terror with 

491
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:58,290
perhaps an overlay of disgust and second
curiosity.

492
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,130
And it's terrorist so that you freeze 
and remained paralyzed.

493
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:02,964
You turn to stone.
When you look at the basilisk or the 

494
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:06,630
snake or the Gorgon,
you turned to stone,

495
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:07,464
you're paralyzed like a prey animal.
And that's so the prey Predator can't 

496
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:11,940
see you at least in part.

497
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,013
And there's other elements of the 
orienting reflects that are associated 

498
00:27:14,911 --> 00:27:15,744
with Predator avoidance.
And then if nothing additionally 

499
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:18,264
terrible happens,
you start to thaw out and you start to 

500
00:27:20,851 --> 00:27:21,684
explore and you do that with image first
and then pr and then practice the 

501
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:27,270
appropriate behaviors and then,
and then automate those.

502
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,640
Now look,
here's the thing that's cool.

503
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:35,390
So that orienting reflects to the 
unknown is it's an admixture of threat,

504
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,980
fear and curiosity,
incentive reward.

505
00:27:40,981 --> 00:27:43,800
So negative emotions and positive 
emotions now,

506
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:47,130
and it's dose dependent.
The larger the anomaly,

507
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:52,250
which means the larger the map,
it blows out when it manifests itself.

508
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:53,454
Think of the difference between being 
irritated at your marital partner 

509
00:27:57,211 --> 00:27:58,500
because they,
you know,

510
00:27:58,501 --> 00:27:59,101
um,
Oh,

511
00:27:59,101 --> 00:27:59,934
who knows?
Because they were late to pick you up 

512
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:02,064
for work compared to how irritated you 
would be if you found out they were 

513
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:05,490
having an affair.

514
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,503
Difference in size of a,
normally the first one disrupts a tiny 

515
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:12,510
little part of your space,
time orientation,

516
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,240
and the second one demolishes your past,
present,

517
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:17,760
and future.
And the larger the disruption,

518
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:20,280
the more negative emotion,
obviously.

519
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,353
And so,
so there's this weird interplay between 

520
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:27,630
negative and positive emotion in the 
response to a normally and,

521
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,110
but it's deeply meaningful,
even if it's even if it paralyzes you,

522
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:32,820
even if it's terrifying,
it's meaningful.

523
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,773
And then that transforms perhaps into 
intense curiosity and you start to 

524
00:28:36,211 --> 00:28:37,044
explore.
Now the phenomena of meaning is a 

525
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,890
manifestation of the complex orienting 
reflex.

526
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:49,080
And so you're wired so that you're not 
just order and you're not just chaos,

527
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:53,760
your order continually confronting chaos
so that the order remains updated.

528
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,530
And you might say,
well,

529
00:28:55,531 --> 00:28:56,364
how do you know how much chaos you 
should confront in order to keep the 

530
00:28:58,951 --> 00:29:00,780
order continually updated?

531
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:05,030
And the answer is meaning.
See,

532
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,873
something is meaningful.
The reason that something is meaningful 

533
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:08,724
is because you're getting a deep 
instinctual signal that you're 

534
00:29:11,461 --> 00:29:15,630
encountering a normally at a rate that 
doesn't exceed your capability.

535
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:19,560
That's also the rate at which you can 
keep yourself updated optimally.

536
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,830
And so meaning isn't epit phenomenal and
it's,

537
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:23,723
and it isn't.
It isn't some kind of delusion that 

538
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:28,200
rationality can and should overcome to 
say,

539
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:29,400
well,
everything's meaningless.

540
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:29,911
It's like,
no,

541
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:32,370
it's not.
Meaning is the most fundamental instinct

542
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:35,580
for adaptation.
And so that's partly why in 12 rules for

543
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:37,290
life.
I said one of the rules,

544
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,143
um,
I think it's rule seven is do what is 

545
00:29:40,741 --> 00:29:43,810
meaningful,
not what is expedient because meaning is

546
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:46,090
a really good guide to longterm 
adaptation.

547
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:48,730
And so then,
and the other thing about meaning,

548
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,060
which is what happens when you get the 
balance between chaos and order,

549
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:52,300
right?

550
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,360
Is that meaning is the antidote to 
despair.

551
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,320
And so if you,
and there's all sorts of reasons in life

552
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:00,154
to be desperate.
And so if you immerse yourself in 

553
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:03,730
meaning,
you can learn to do that.

554
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,593
You can learn to do that.
You can make that goal your highest 

555
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:08,860
goal.
And so then the highest goal would be to

556
00:30:08,861 --> 00:30:11,920
be the sort of mythological hero,
let's say,

557
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:16,750
to embody and incarnate and imitate the 
mythological hero,

558
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:19,660
like the imitation of Christ,
which is what you're called to do.

559
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:23,500
If you happen to be Christian,
that means that you live in meaning.

560
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:24,334
And that meaning is the antidote to the 
suffering of life that would otherwise 

561
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:30,220
make you brutal and vengeful and unhappy
and miserable.

562
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:31,054
And like that,
that young guy who just mowed down 12 

563
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:36,970
people in Toronto,
these are real things.

564
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,530
You lose your sense of meaning.
You end up in hell and inhale,

565
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,520
you do all sorts of terrible things.

566
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:43,683
These are,
these are dreadful realities and it 

567
00:30:46,031 --> 00:30:49,090
isn't as if they're not grounded in the 
appropriate science.

568
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,343
So anyways,
that was also a very complicated 

569
00:30:53,381 --> 00:30:57,340
question began in a longterm 
relationship.

570
00:30:57,341 --> 00:30:58,174
We are considering kids.
What are your thoughts about gay people 

571
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:02,330
raising children?
Um,

572
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,590
I think the devil's in the details to 
tell you the truth.

573
00:31:08,591 --> 00:31:10,660
When,
if I was ever talking to any individuals

574
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:11,710
about that,
that's it.

575
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:12,461
The question is,
well,

576
00:31:12,461 --> 00:31:13,750
how would you raise them?
I mean,

577
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:14,980
you have problems,
right?

578
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,300
If you're both of the same sex,
then you're going to have the problem of

579
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:21,910
how to provide the proper model for,
you know,

580
00:31:21,911 --> 00:31:24,160
let's say you have a boy and a girl.
Um,

581
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,193
we know this is indisputable and this is
something I've talked to Warren Farrell 

582
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:29,854
about kids in intacct,
heterosexual families where the father 

583
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:33,874
is present,
do way better on multiple indices than 

584
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:40,930
kids who are,
are part of single parent families.

585
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,620
Now that doesn't mean that there are no 
single parents who do a good job,

586
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,020
right?
That's not the same bloody claim.

587
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:51,160
Those are different claims.
But on average kid,

588
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:53,920
not only do kids where fathers are 
present do better,

589
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:54,754
but societies or even even local 
societies where there are more fathers 

590
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:00,124
present do better not only for the kids 
that they're fathering but the kids in 

591
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:04,954
the neighborhood,
whether lots of intact families with 

592
00:32:06,851 --> 00:32:07,684
fathers do better.
And so I believe quite firmly that the 

593
00:32:11,171 --> 00:32:15,490
nuclear family is the smallest viable 
human unit,

594
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,380
father,
mother,

595
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,810
child,
smallest viable unit.

596
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:22,780
And if you fragment it below that,
then you end up paying.

597
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:26,170
Now that that doesn't mean that there 
are way,

598
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,093
there aren't ways that you can operate 
in smaller unit or a different unit 

599
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,313
effectively.
But you have to contend with the fact 

600
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:39,750
that it's necessary for pe,
for kids to have models for both sexes.

601
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,473
And that means that means accepting that
the sexes are different even though 

602
00:32:44,391 --> 00:32:45,224
there's a fair overlap between the mix 
epting that they're different and that 

603
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:51,620
both sexes play their role.
It looks like what fathers do.

604
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:53,600
And I talked to Warren Farrell a lot 
about this,

605
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:57,860
and I'm going to release this video this
month about what fathers do and a lot of

606
00:32:57,861 --> 00:33:01,280
what they do is rough and tumble play 
with the kids,

607
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:02,510
which kids really,
really,

608
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:03,344
really like.
And it's really important as Jaak 

609
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,643
Panksepp a great effect of 
neuroscientists laid out in his studies 

610
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:09,344
on routes.
He discovered the place circuitry and 

611
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:13,520
fathers.
This is something feral told me,

612
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:14,354
which was extraordinarily interesting,
is that fathers used the joy of the 

613
00:33:17,601 --> 00:33:18,434
possibility of play as a scaffold to 
help children learn to delay 

614
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:22,994
gratification.
So imagine a father spends a bunch of 

615
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:26,780
time playing with his kids and they're 
having a great old time.

616
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,613
They're wrestling around and pushing 
each other's limits to find out where 

617
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:31,064
they are and learning the physiological 
dance that goes along with direct 

618
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:36,170
contact,
direct,

619
00:33:36,171 --> 00:33:39,080
exciting contact,
learning what hurts and what doesn't and

620
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,123
what constitutes fair play and what 
isn't and how everybody can play and 

621
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:43,544
still enjoy the game and how excited you
could get before it's too much and how 

622
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:48,920
much you should wine and how much you 
shouldn't and when you can.

623
00:33:48,921 --> 00:33:52,040
Object to being hurt,
all of that at a deeply embodied level.

624
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,620
The kids love that.
They'll line up for that.

625
00:33:54,621 --> 00:33:55,454
And panksepp demonstrated very clearly 
that rats will work to play and that 

626
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,463
routes play fair and they learned to 
play fair because of iterated play 

627
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:03,854
bouts.
And that if you don't let juvenile male 

628
00:34:06,231 --> 00:34:07,064
rats play,
then their prefrontal cortex is don't 

629
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:12,590
develop and they get attention deficit 
disorder or the equivalent in rats.

630
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,210
And then you can treat that with rental 
it.

631
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:19,190
And so this is all very vital material.
Now if you're going to,

632
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,320
if you,
if you're gay,

633
00:34:21,321 --> 00:34:23,630
let's say there's two,
two men or two women,

634
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:28,810
then you have the problem of what you're
going to do for the Contra Sexual,

635
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,020
um,
target.

636
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:30,890
And you can say,
well,

637
00:34:30,891 --> 00:34:33,590
it doesn't matter because there's no 
differences between men and women.

638
00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:34,424
And you can gerrymander the damn 
question that way and avoid you're 

639
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:39,830
remorseful responsibility.
Or you can face it squarely and say,

640
00:34:39,831 --> 00:34:40,664
look,
you've decided to step outside of the 

641
00:34:42,351 --> 00:34:45,260
cultural norm and to organize a 
nonstandard relationship,

642
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,930
which puts a tremendous rented 
responsibility on you.

643
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,830
And then you have to figure out how you 
can provide for your children what it is

644
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:55,190
that they would get in the classic 
minimal human unit.

645
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,170
So,
and more power to you.

646
00:34:57,171 --> 00:34:58,610
I hope you can do a good job of it.

647
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:01,000
You know,
I think there's room in the world for,

648
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:05,870
for a diverse range of approaches to 
complex life problems,

649
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:08,300
like,
like having kids and finding a partner.

650
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,990
But that doesn't mean you get to bury 
your head in the sand about the absolute

651
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:12,943
realities of life.
And the fact that there are biological 

652
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:15,524
differences between men and women to 
deny that is reprehensible in my 

653
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,570
estimation and besides the empirical 
doubt at the scientific data are crystal

654
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:25,430
clear.
So and so.

655
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,833
Okay.
Carl Jung says that everything 

656
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:31,244
unconscious is projected into reality.
How do you know if you are perceiving 

657
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:36,410
reality accurately or are just 
projecting?

658
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,500
Great.
Yeah.

659
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:39,540
Well,
that's partly why I'm a pragmatist.

660
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,980
Well,
there's a bunch of ways.

661
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,350
Um,
there's a bunch of ways that,

662
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:45,870
you know,
pain tells you

663
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,190
if you make a mistake and you hurt 
yourself while then you're stupid theory

664
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,060
was wrong,
right?

665
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,880
That's what the pain says.
You're stupid theory was wrong.

666
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,440
And that's a pragmatic,
you see,

667
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:58,980
that's another indication of pragmatic 
theory of truth.

668
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,720
You lay out.
Look,

669
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,613
when you look at the world,
you look at the world with a set of 

670
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:04,164
presuppositions.
I outlined that in chapter 10 in in 

671
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,403
rules,
in 12 rules for life called be precise 

672
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:09,984
in your speech.
It indicates that when you look at the 

673
00:36:12,841 --> 00:36:13,674
world,
you look at it through a value 

674
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:15,384
structure.
You can't help that because you're 

675
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:17,214
always aiming at something in the world 
and you're always aiming at something 

676
00:36:18,901 --> 00:36:19,734
you want and you're trying to get it.
And so that means that you look at the 

677
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:23,214
world through a value structure.
Now the question is whether or not that 

678
00:36:25,591 --> 00:36:29,190
value structure is valid,
and that's a very complicated question.

679
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,900
Okay,
so how do you know if it's valid?

680
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,320
Number one,
you lay it out and you act it out.

681
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,263
You,
you implement it perceptually and then 

682
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:39,120
you act it out.
And if you get what you wanted,

683
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,940
what the theory predicted,
that's another way of thinking about it,

684
00:36:41,941 --> 00:36:43,830
but wanted is a better way of thinking 
about it.

685
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:44,903
Then the fact that that behavioral 
routine and perceptual structure 

686
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:53,190
produced the intended result validates 
it as a tool for obtaining that result.

687
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:56,070
And that's a form of truth.
Now,

688
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:56,963
it might be the only form of truth,
although I'm not convinced of that 

689
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:00,390
completely.
But it might be,

690
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,730
it's a very complicated question.
Now,

691
00:37:02,731 --> 00:37:04,920
how do you know if you're stupid theory 
is wrong.

692
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,450
Okay?
A,

693
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,660
it fails and you're hurt.
Pain tells you,

694
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,330
you pragmatically,
your theory was wrong.

695
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,313
So that's why you should pay attention 
to your own pain because your suffering 

696
00:37:15,631 --> 00:37:17,760
is indication that you still have things
to learn.

697
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,520
And maybe the suffering of other people 
is also that,

698
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:21,963
um,
maybe something unexpected or 

699
00:37:23,131 --> 00:37:23,964
unpredictable happens when you're laying
out your plan and then the anomalous 

700
00:37:27,001 --> 00:37:29,400
manifest itself,
the unexpected or chaos.

701
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,350
And then you get anxious.
Well,

702
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:35,100
anxiety is an indication that your plan,
your Arrow didn't fly too.

703
00:37:35,101 --> 00:37:37,080
It's mark,
so you aimed wrong.

704
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,870
And that might mean a small error,
you know,

705
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:40,704
maybe a tiny adjustment of your bowl or 
it might mean you just don't know what 

706
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:45,900
the hell you're doing at all and 
everything is lost.

707
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:50,310
And so anxiety tells you if your theory 
is wrong and then,

708
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,313
and then other people tell you that.
And that's why you want to surround 

709
00:37:54,061 --> 00:37:59,061
yourself with other people because you 
distribute your cognitive resources.

710
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,680
Ew,
you,

711
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,920
you distribute your problems to the 
cognitive resources of the social group.

712
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,760
That's what we do when we price things,
right?

713
00:38:08,761 --> 00:38:09,594
Everyone votes on the price of something
because it's so difficult because the 

714
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:12,954
price of something has to be established
in relationship to the price of 

715
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:17,580
everything else.
And that's always in flux.

716
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,030
And so it's computationally impossible 
problem.

717
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:25,950
And so we outsource it to the market,
which is the free cognitive decision of,

718
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,920
of millions of people.
And that's how we determine price.

719
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,933
And so one of the things you do to make 
sure that you're not any stupider than 

720
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:34,560
you have to be blind,
ignorant,

721
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:37,180
biased,
and all of that is you surround yourself

722
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:38,014
with other people and you try to treat 
them well enough so that they can 

723
00:38:40,061 --> 00:38:40,894
tolerate you.
And then every time that you do 

724
00:38:42,371 --> 00:38:46,630
something stupid because one of your 
theories is it is vague or incomplete or

725
00:38:46,631 --> 00:38:48,730
wrong or biased or you're willfully 
blind,

726
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,530
then they slap you on the side of the 
head.

727
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:51,663
They ignore you because you're boring.
They don't laugh at your jokes because 

728
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:55,600
they're stupid.
They,

729
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,463
they,
they are irritated at your auctions 

730
00:38:58,301 --> 00:38:59,134
because you're not taking your own 
longterm interests or the interests of 

731
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:02,950
other people into account.

732
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,370
And so you have pain,
you have anxiety,

733
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,670
you have the reward of success that 
that's,

734
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,533
that's a positive indicator that your 
theory is okay and then you have the 

735
00:39:12,821 --> 00:39:16,870
reactions of everyone else and if you're
clued in,

736
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:20,230
you pay attention to all of those things
and you try to update your,

737
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,350
your order,
which is your perceptions.

738
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,333
You try to update your order constantly 
as a consequence of being humble in the 

739
00:39:27,311 --> 00:39:28,144
face of your errors,
which is why humility is the 

740
00:39:29,711 --> 00:39:32,890
precondition for learning and why it's 
one of the highest moral virtues.

741
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,720
So
and perceiving reality accurately.

742
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:42,460
You don't really perceive reality and 
you don't really perceive accurately.

743
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:47,350
You perceive small portions of reality,
extraordinarily limited in space.

744
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,184
And time and accurately means well 
enough so that when you do what you're 

745
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:52,780
doing,
it works.

746
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,970
That's why I'm a pragmatist.
I mean,

747
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:55,960
not only,
I mean,

748
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:56,823
you know,
I mean there's lots of other 

749
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,670
philosophical streams that have 
influenced my thought.

750
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,260
Existentialism,
Phenomenal Log,

751
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:04,090
phenomenology,
dimension to others.

752
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,313
Um,
but the thing is you can't perceive 

753
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:10,570
reality accurately because you don't 
know everything.

754
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:11,404
So,
and you're full of biases and you're 

755
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,503
ignorant as hell.
And so the best you can do is perceive 

756
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:16,354
small bits of reality well enough so 
that you can more or less get what you 

757
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:19,384
need in a relatively short period of 
time without screwing yourself up too 

758
00:40:22,511 --> 00:40:26,050
badly in the medium to longterm.
That's pretty much what you've got.

759
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,660
And that doesn't mean truth is 
impossible,

760
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,543
just means that it's very,
very complicated to decide what truth 

761
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:32,944
is.
And because the question is what is 

762
00:40:34,751 --> 00:40:36,790
truth for someone whose knowledge is 
limited,

763
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:40,150
right?
Because obviously because your knowledge

764
00:40:40,151 --> 00:40:44,050
is limited and you don't know everything
saying some fundamental way,

765
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,510
you're ignorant or wrong about 
everything.

766
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,120
But that doesn't help because you still 
have to act in the world.

767
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:53,110
So there are bounded truths,
there are bounded truths and so,

768
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:58,090
all right,
if past experiences shape us,

769
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,290
oh no,
I missed one.

770
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:00,963
You cite a tired brain foggy thinking as
the reason to stop answering questions 

771
00:41:05,141 --> 00:41:05,974
or giving a talk.
How do you combat this well working or 

772
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:10,160
writing daily?
Um,

773
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:14,710
well I eat a big breakfast relatively 
soon on waking.

774
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:15,783
That really helps.
If any of you out there are anxious and 

775
00:41:18,131 --> 00:41:18,964
many of you no doubt are,
there'll be a large number of you who 

776
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:22,474
are anxious and don't eat breakfast and 
there'll be a whole bunch of you out 

777
00:41:24,221 --> 00:41:25,600
there who think,
well I don't eat breakfast.

778
00:41:25,601 --> 00:41:27,610
It isn't necessary.
It's like that's wrong.

779
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,100
It's necessary.
You fasted all night.

780
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,680
If you load yourself cognitively or 
physiologically in the morning,

781
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,843
your brain stressed will produce,
will encourage your body to produce 

782
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:39,614
insulin.
It will take all the blood sugar out of 

783
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:44,570
your blood and then you're done for the 
day and then you'll be anxious.

784
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,870
And another lot of the rest of you too,
you'll find if you're anxious,

785
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:49,010
try this.
It's really,

786
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:53,990
really interesting experiment.
The next time you anxious,

787
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:54,973
go eat something,
eat like eat some protein and fat would 

788
00:41:57,861 --> 00:41:59,660
be best.
You could have cheese and crackers.

789
00:41:59,661 --> 00:42:02,000
I'm not a big fan of carbohydrates but 
whatever.

790
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,180
Eat whatever you're willing to eat but 
make it solid.

791
00:42:05,181 --> 00:42:06,014
Don't eat a peanut butter or don't need 
a like a chocolate bar or something 

792
00:42:08,031 --> 00:42:09,860
sweet.
Eat something substantial,

793
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,420
a piece of meat,
a piece of cheese,

794
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,403
some peanut butter,
something like that and then wait 10 

795
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:15,974
minutes and see if you're less anxious 
and try that for like two weeks every 

796
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:19,544
time you get anxious,
eat something because then you can find 

797
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:25,040
out if you're anxious,
if you're anxiety is linked to low blood

798
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:28,850
sugar and it's very likely that it is,
especially if you also get irritable and

799
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,880
foggy and your thinking and so,
and the best way to treat that as far as

800
00:42:34,341 --> 00:42:36,590
I've been able to tell,
and there's a decent literature on this,

801
00:42:36,591 --> 00:42:39,470
is to make sure that you eat a big 
breakfast and you might say,

802
00:42:39,471 --> 00:42:40,730
well,
I'm not hungry in the morning.

803
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,440
It's like,
who the hell cares if you're hungry?

804
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:45,530
I didn't say enjoy your breakfast.
I said,

805
00:42:45,531 --> 00:42:47,240
eat it.
That's not the same thing.

806
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,643
You know,
there's lots of things that you need to 

807
00:42:49,641 --> 00:42:52,580
do that you don't enjoy to begin with.
You'll get hungry in six months and then

808
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:55,460
you'll start to enjoy it.
So that's a massive difference.

809
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:59,060
I take small naps quite frequently.
If I'm wiped out,

810
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,253
you know,
I'll go have a nap for 10 minutes or 15 

811
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:04,700
minutes and then that helps quite a lot.
Um,

812
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:10,120
I try to wake up fairly regular,
a lot on a fairly regular schedule.

813
00:43:10,491 --> 00:43:11,324
That's another thing I would really 
recommend for people whose lives are in 

814
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:17,210
disarray and who are anxious.
Try to fix your wake time,

815
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,940
sleep going when you sleep,
that's not so important.

816
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:23,240
So you can still stay up late and have 
fun and all that.

817
00:43:23,241 --> 00:43:25,370
But getting up in the morning is really 
helpful.

818
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:26,230
Okay.

819
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,820
So,
um,

820
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,440
you know,
and you,

821
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,210
you also have to figure out how much you
can work or write.

822
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:33,463
I can't write for more than about Max.
My sustainable maximum for writing is 

823
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:40,280
three hours a day.
And if I push it past that,

824
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:43,070
then especially if I'm editing,
I,

825
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,750
I make mistakes.
When I'm editing.

826
00:43:44,751 --> 00:43:48,170
So that's counterproductive and I can't 
sustain it across time.

827
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:52,940
And so I don't really think you can do 
more than about three hours of extremely

828
00:43:52,941 --> 00:43:55,910
intense intellectual work a day.
Although if you have a nap,

829
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,470
you can stretch that.
But I think at least I end up paying for

830
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:02,450
it across time.
So nap,

831
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,460
make sure you eat,
um,

832
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:05,623
and make sure you eat protein and fat 
and not carbohydrates because 

833
00:44:07,761 --> 00:44:10,380
carbohydrates are basically poisonous.
Um,

834
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:14,443
that's about,
that's about and make sure that you get 

835
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:17,210
enough sleep.
So that's,

836
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,750
that's how I combat it and try to make 
myself hyper efficient,

837
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:22,880
which is also a really interesting thing
to try.

838
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,240
You know,
I was talking to my agents at CAA,

839
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:27,074
creative artists agency in La and I just
hired a publicist to help me manage 

840
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,333
media in a more intelligent manner.
And we're trying to think about our 

841
00:44:34,201 --> 00:44:35,760
overarching philosophy.
You know,

842
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:36,603
and I first proposed to the CA guys that
are overarching philosophy would be 

843
00:44:40,741 --> 00:44:43,470
something like,
cause you need an overarching philosophy

844
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,260
under which you nest all your specific 
actions.

845
00:44:46,261 --> 00:44:49,560
It was something like to educate as many
people as possible.

846
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,500
In the shortest period of time,
which seems like a really good goal,

847
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:53,334
like why the hell not do that?
But then we broadened out a little bit 

848
00:44:55,681 --> 00:44:58,710
this week which was to try to do as much
good as possible,

849
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:02,340
as efficiently as possible and that 
efficiency thing is really fun.

850
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,770
If you guys who are listening are out 
for a challenge,

851
00:45:04,771 --> 00:45:05,604
like one of the things that you can,
I think this heightens the meaning in 

852
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:10,560
your life is to try to do difficult 
things,

853
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:11,760
right?
Aim High,

854
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,013
don't name Sadam High,
you can't manage it and make sure you 

855
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:19,410
break down your aims into reasonably 
attainable sub goals,

856
00:45:19,411 --> 00:45:20,244
but you want to aim high and then you 
want to see how hyper efficient you can 

857
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:25,350
get.
That's a great thing to do in your early

858
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,640
twenties is to see,
okay,

859
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:28,680
like discipline yourself.
You think,

860
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:29,514
okay,
how much work can I do if I load myself 

861
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:33,960
right to the maximum,
how far do I,

862
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:34,823
how far can I work?
How hard can I work until I exhaust 

863
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:38,334
myself?
And then you back off obviously because 

864
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,590
the optimal amount of working productive
engagement,

865
00:45:43,591 --> 00:45:44,424
let's say,
is that which is sustainable across 

866
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:47,820
decades.
So you have to,

867
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,713
you have to learn that,
but you don't learn that without 

868
00:45:50,161 --> 00:45:52,170
stretching yourself to your limits to 
begin with.

869
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:53,423
And you know,
if your life isn't everything it could 

870
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:55,374
be,
and if you're suffering from an excess 

871
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:59,670
of meaninglessness,
well it means you're not oriented in the

872
00:45:59,671 --> 00:46:00,504
world of chaos and order properly.
It's like you could learn to discipline 

873
00:46:02,581 --> 00:46:04,470
yourself,
look,

874
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:05,304
figure out what,
figure out what it is that you need to 

875
00:46:06,781 --> 00:46:09,540
do and that you want to do and then see 
how efficient you can get.

876
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,530
Because one of the things that's quite 
fun is to figure out if you have a task.

877
00:46:13,531 --> 00:46:16,590
I always tell my graduate students this,
if they're doing an experiment too,

878
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,023
if you have a task that you have to do,
it's really interesting to spend a few 

879
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,860
minutes,
sometimes hours,

880
00:46:22,861 --> 00:46:23,694
depending on how long the task is.
See if you can figure out how to do it 

881
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:28,290
from,
from five to 10 times faster.

882
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,990
It means you'll have to rearrange the 
way you think about it,

883
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:32,130
but you can often do it.

884
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,320
And that's how extremely productive 
people get.

885
00:46:34,321 --> 00:46:35,690
So hyper efficient,
you know,

886
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,593
sometimes it means you have to delegate.
It means sometimes it means you have to 

887
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:41,610
bring other people aboard.
That's delegation as well I suppose.

888
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,460
Um,
but there's a lot of preconceptions that

889
00:46:44,461 --> 00:46:45,294
you hold about who you are and who the 
world is that you could dispense with 

890
00:46:47,941 --> 00:46:50,670
that would make you a way more efficient
actor in the world.

891
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,830
And so,
all right,

892
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,060
so there,
that's that.

893
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:58,020
If past experiences shape us from the 
moment of birth,

894
00:46:58,021 --> 00:46:58,854
how can an action be ever said to be the
result of freewill rather than the 

895
00:47:01,621 --> 00:47:03,630
accumulation of past influences?
Well,

896
00:47:03,631 --> 00:47:04,464
it is in large part the accumulation of 
past influences because that's 

897
00:47:06,811 --> 00:47:08,130
knowledge.
But I addressed that,

898
00:47:08,131 --> 00:47:10,950
I would say already pretty thoroughly in
my discussion of freewill.

899
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,020
Your,
your freewill isn't absolute.

900
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,490
I mean,
what are you a genie?

901
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:17,070
Even a genie is constrained inside a 
lamp,

902
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,720
you know,
so there's,

903
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,990
there's no action without constraint.
There's no action without limitation.

904
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,610
So it's,
it's,

905
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,690
it's just not conceptualized well and 
all of your choices are constrained,

906
00:47:27,691 --> 00:47:30,160
not least by the fact that you have to 
keep yourself alive.

907
00:47:30,161 --> 00:47:34,570
So even just because there are 
limitations that emerge,

908
00:47:34,571 --> 00:47:38,290
say as a consequence of the accumulation
of past influences doesn't mean that you

909
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:39,124
aren't,
that you don't still have a massive 

910
00:47:40,601 --> 00:47:41,434
domain of freedom.
So what is your opinion of attachment 

911
00:47:45,971 --> 00:47:49,720
based therapy and do you think that 
therapy is at risk of encouraging people

912
00:47:49,721 --> 00:47:50,554
to wallow in self pity?
And I'm not going to talk about 

913
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:53,314
attachment based therapy cause I don't 
know enough about it to provide an 

914
00:47:55,361 --> 00:47:56,194
intelligent critique,
but I can answer the second part of the 

915
00:47:58,061 --> 00:47:58,894
question.
Do I think that therapy risks 

916
00:48:00,371 --> 00:48:02,260
encouraging people to wallow in self 
pity?

917
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,780
Not if it's done by a competent 
therapist.

918
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,740
If you're a therapist is encouraging you
to wallow in self pity,

919
00:48:08,741 --> 00:48:10,360
then it's time to get the hell out of 
there.

920
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:11,323
You've got a therapist who thinks that 
they're supposed to offer you a safe 

921
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:15,310
space.
That's not helpful.

922
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,890
Look,
what do you do as a therapist?

923
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,013
You Act as a strategic counselor.
So let's imagine someone comes to see 

924
00:48:22,931 --> 00:48:24,760
me.
So there's two big mysteries,

925
00:48:24,761 --> 00:48:27,700
right?
What's wrong and what,

926
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:30,400
what would look better,
what's wrong and,

927
00:48:30,401 --> 00:48:32,170
and how,
what would it cure look like?

928
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:34,840
And I don't know.
And so if you're a therapist,

929
00:48:34,841 --> 00:48:35,674
the first thing you want to do is figure
out that you don't know what's wrong 

930
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:39,730
with this person.
And probably neither do they.

931
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,650
And you also don't know what's right for
them.

932
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,770
And so then you start talking to the 
person to try to solve that problem.

933
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:45,341
It's like,
okay,

934
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:48,070
you've come to see me because something 
isn't right in your life.

935
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:49,803
What is it?
And so then the person has to talk and 

936
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:52,624
talk and talk.
And you have to ask them questions to 

937
00:48:53,771 --> 00:48:56,320
find out because you know,
maybe they're depressed,

938
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:58,870
maybe they're anxious,
maybe they came from a terrible family.

939
00:48:59,160 --> 00:48:59,993
Um,
maybe they're really hard on themselves 

940
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,310
and things are actually going better 
than they think.

941
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,470
Like you have no idea what's wrong with 
them.

942
00:49:05,471 --> 00:49:07,090
You're ignorant,
you're ignorant.

943
00:49:07,091 --> 00:49:09,430
And so are they.
And so you say,

944
00:49:09,431 --> 00:49:10,264
look,
you can tell me anything as long try to 

945
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:12,574
tell the truth because otherwise we're 
just not going to get anywhere because 

946
00:49:14,261 --> 00:49:17,350
we're trying to deal with reality here.
So tell me the truth.

947
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,680
I'm not going to be judgemental in any 
stupid sense.

948
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:24,190
I'm going to judge like mad cause I want
to help you do things right.

949
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:26,110
So I'm going to be,
I'm going to be judging like mad,

950
00:49:26,111 --> 00:49:28,900
but I'm not going to throw you out 
because of the things you say.

951
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:29,883
You're going to have to wander all over 
weird territory to explain your problem 

952
00:49:33,371 --> 00:49:36,130
because you don't even know what it is.
So you have to listen a lot.

953
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,140
And the first thing you want to figure 
it out is okay,

954
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:38,974
what's wrong here?
And the personal tell you a hundred 

955
00:49:41,801 --> 00:49:42,634
things that might be wrong and that 
there is quite painful to listen too 

956
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:46,180
often.
You know,

957
00:49:46,181 --> 00:49:47,800
they'll tell you about their past and 
their present.

958
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:52,830
I don't mean painful in that it's not 
engaging or that it's not worthwhile.

959
00:49:53,621 --> 00:49:56,050
I mean people whose lives have a lot of 
pain in them.

960
00:49:56,051 --> 00:49:56,884
So it's painful to partake in that.
So they'll tell you like a hundred 

961
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:03,310
things that might be wrong and then you 
do an analysis with them and you think,

962
00:50:03,311 --> 00:50:04,144
well,
okay,

963
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:07,570
how many of those things really probably
aren't a problem?

964
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:10,780
The first thing that happens is if you 
let a person talk about,

965
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,910
let's say they tell you about a hundred 
problems,

966
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:17,110
the first thing you find out is that 90 
of them aren't real problems.

967
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:20,500
And the person just figures that out as 
they talked them through.

968
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,453
So they say,
well that's linked to this and maybe 

969
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:23,374
that's not really a problem.
That's not as bad as I thought it 

970
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,380
wasn't.
We can probably ignore that.

971
00:50:26,381 --> 00:50:27,214
It's like they have a handful of cards 
that aren't organized and they don't 

972
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:33,560
know what to do with them.
There's too many cards.

973
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,330
And so you say,
look,

974
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,450
lay your cards on the table,
all of them.

975
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:38,303
This is also what you do when you're 
listening to someone you're intimate 

976
00:50:40,101 --> 00:50:42,830
with and they're trying to solve a 
problem and you have to be patient to do

977
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,720
this cause they're all upset about 
something.

978
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:45,470
Right.

979
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:46,303
And you don't know what it is,
and maybe they're upset about you and 

980
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,870
maybe they're upset about themselves and
they're not handling it very well,

981
00:50:50,871 --> 00:50:54,260
and they're impulsive and,
and volatile and hard on you.

982
00:50:54,261 --> 00:50:55,041
And you say,
all right,

983
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:56,450
Christ,
I'm going to listen to you.

984
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:58,340
It's like,
what's your stupid problem?

985
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:00,590
And then they lay out their problem,
right?

986
00:51:00,591 --> 00:51:01,424
The problem space.
And you have to listen and not jump in 

987
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:07,250
there too quickly with a dam solution 
because what the hell do you know?

988
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:09,560
So you listened to them,
lay out the problem space,

989
00:51:09,561 --> 00:51:11,870
they lay their cards on the table.
Then you say,

990
00:51:11,871 --> 00:51:12,704
well,
we don't have to pay attention to this 

991
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:15,080
and we don't have to pay attention to 
this.

992
00:51:15,081 --> 00:51:15,914
We don't have to pay attention to this.
And that's the cutting the dragon of 

993
00:51:18,051 --> 00:51:20,450
chaos down to size.
That's what it is.

994
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,030
You look at the dragon of chaos and it 
starts to shrink.

995
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:24,403
Okay?
So,

996
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:25,903
and that's because by looking at it,
you indicate to the dragon that you're 

997
00:51:29,001 --> 00:51:29,834
bigger than you thought you were and 
that you're bigger than it thought you 

998
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,220
were.
And that's very,

999
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:35,390
very useful.
So anyways,

1000
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:38,030
you lay out your cards and then you 
start to organize them.

1001
00:51:38,031 --> 00:51:40,070
It's like,
well actually I only have 10 problems.

1002
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,750
All right.
So then you think,

1003
00:51:41,751 --> 00:51:42,584
well,
how can we break those problems down 

1004
00:51:43,431 --> 00:51:44,264
into manageable sub problems?
And how can you go about addressing 

1005
00:51:46,191 --> 00:51:47,780
them?
That can be very complicated.

1006
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,580
I hate my job.
Well,

1007
00:51:49,581 --> 00:51:51,350
do you have an alternative?
No.

1008
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:52,461
Well,
why not?

1009
00:51:52,461 --> 00:51:53,600
Well,
I don't have a resume.

1010
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,270
I hate being interviewed.
I'm afraid to make a resume.

1011
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,020
I lost up my education.
Um,

1012
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,650
I don't have any options.
It's like,

1013
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:02,390
yeah,
that's a lot of problems man.

1014
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,440
And that's,
you know,

1015
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:04,303
those are strategic problems.
So then you have to figure out how to 

1016
00:52:06,111 --> 00:52:10,100
help the PR person strategize and then 
implement the strategies.

1017
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:11,840
And so the next step is,
okay,

1018
00:52:11,841 --> 00:52:12,674
now we know your problems.
If you could have a solution like that 

1019
00:52:17,031 --> 00:52:20,420
would be the opposite of the problem.
What might a solution looked like?

1020
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:22,400
Same issue.
It's like,

1021
00:52:22,401 --> 00:52:23,690
well,
there's lots of solutions.

1022
00:52:23,691 --> 00:52:26,090
I don't know what to do with my life.
I don't know what job to have.

1023
00:52:26,091 --> 00:52:28,490
I don't know what person to,
um,

1024
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:29,743
uh,
establish a long term intimate 

1025
00:52:31,461 --> 00:52:32,294
relationship with,
I don't know what I would like to do 

1026
00:52:33,711 --> 00:52:34,544
with my family.
I don't know how to use my time outside 

1027
00:52:36,051 --> 00:52:36,884
of work.
I don't know how to resist temptation 

1028
00:52:38,631 --> 00:52:40,910
like drug and alcohol abuse.
I don't know.

1029
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:41,803
Um,
I don't know how to take care of myself 

1030
00:52:43,311 --> 00:52:46,310
mentally and physically.
All of these complicated problems.

1031
00:52:46,311 --> 00:52:46,911
It's like,
okay,

1032
00:52:46,911 --> 00:52:50,540
let's sketch out a potential solution.
If you could have what you wanted.

1033
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:51,920
So that would be a cure.

1034
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:55,430
What would that look like?
We formalize this by the way,

1035
00:52:55,431 --> 00:52:56,264
in the future authoring process.
So if you do the future authoring 

1036
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,174
program,
which is part of the self authoring 

1037
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:02,420
suite,
it will guide you through doing this.

1038
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:03,363
And it's unbelievably useful to do that 
cause you're not going to hit what you 

1039
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:07,850
don't aim at.
So,

1040
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:10,100
so then you,
you have the person lay out,

1041
00:53:10,101 --> 00:53:11,270
okay,
well where are we headed?

1042
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,313
It's a map.
Now we know where we are and it's a 

1043
00:53:13,971 --> 00:53:14,804
problem.
Now we have to figure out where we're 

1044
00:53:15,831 --> 00:53:17,240
headed.
And so,

1045
00:53:17,241 --> 00:53:20,120
and then finally,
once we figure out where we're headed,

1046
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:23,030
we have to figure out how to get there.
We have to make the map.

1047
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,500
It's got a beginning place,
it's got an in place.

1048
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,200
Now we have to map out the terrain.
So like,

1049
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:32,340
well I didn't finish my degree or maybe 
I didn't go to college or maybe I didn't

1050
00:53:32,341 --> 00:53:33,120
finish high school.

1051
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:33,840
It's like,
well,

1052
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,430
do you need a different job?
Yes.

1053
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:37,530
Do you need a high school diploma to get
that?

1054
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:38,693
Yes.
What steps do you have to take to get a 

1055
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:43,240
high school diploma?
Um,

1056
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,170
maybe you have to start with one course,
right?

1057
00:53:46,171 --> 00:53:47,460
Okay.
Where do you find the course?

1058
00:53:47,461 --> 00:53:48,294
You'd go look it up online.
What things make you afraid to go back 

1059
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:53,280
to school?
Which of those things are stopping you?

1060
00:53:53,281 --> 00:53:55,080
How are you going to overcome those 
fears?

1061
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,063
So you take the large scale vision,
which is the place you're headed to in 

1062
00:53:58,801 --> 00:54:00,120
the future.
That's the cure.

1063
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:04,080
And then you break it down into the 
strategic elements that are necessary to

1064
00:54:04,081 --> 00:54:04,914
be implemented on a day to day basis.
And you do that so that they're 

1065
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:10,110
difficult.
But attainable.

1066
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,660
And then the person,
if they're not difficult,

1067
00:54:12,661 --> 00:54:14,760
then they're not worth attaining.
Obviously.

1068
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:16,613
Obviously you're not pushing yourself 
and you want the person not only to 

1069
00:54:18,691 --> 00:54:20,730
develop in the direction they're 
supposed to develop,

1070
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,860
but you want to get them better at 
developing.

1071
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:26,100
So you want to push them just like you 
do with kids or yourself if you have any

1072
00:54:26,101 --> 00:54:30,870
sense.
And so we'll break it down into small,

1073
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,850
implementable daily processes and then 
you review those with your,

1074
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:39,030
with your client.
None of that's wallowing in self pity,

1075
00:54:39,031 --> 00:54:40,350
man.
Quite the contrary,

1076
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:42,330
quite the contrary.
So,

1077
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:46,440
so psychotherapy is get your story 
together.

1078
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:48,030
Who are you,
where you're going,

1079
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:50,610
where are you going?
What's your strategy?

1080
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,013
How are you going to learn to overcome 
the frightening and unexpected things 

1081
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:57,630
that are going to pop up at you when you
implement that strategy?

1082
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:00,960
So in those can be some of those things 
can be the natural world.

1083
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,780
I'm afraid of death,
I'm afraid of illness,

1084
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:04,703
I'm afraid of insanity.
And some of those can be the social 

1085
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,980
world.
I'm afraid of my boss.

1086
00:55:07,981 --> 00:55:10,380
I'm afraid of my wife,
I'm afraid of my friends.

1087
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:14,190
I'm afraid of being humiliated.
I'm afraid that people won't like me.

1088
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,410
Those are the two big classes of fears,
right?

1089
00:55:16,411 --> 00:55:20,220
Fear of the Great Mother Nature,
fear of the great father culture.

1090
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,353
And if you're really afraid,
you get to have both those fears at the 

1091
00:55:23,011 --> 00:55:23,844
same time.
So there's nothing about that that's 

1092
00:55:25,591 --> 00:55:27,900
wallowing in self pity.
Quite the contrary.

1093
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:31,140
It's a bad therapist that does that.
They're not there to make,

1094
00:55:31,141 --> 00:55:31,974
to feel sorry for you.
They are there to be on the side of the 

1095
00:55:35,941 --> 00:55:40,560
part of you that's aiming up and to 
encourage you and to allow you to have a

1096
00:55:40,561 --> 00:55:45,030
space where you can lay out your 
thoughts using your free speech to think

1097
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,180
where you can lay out your thoughts 
about what's wrong with you and how that

1098
00:55:48,181 --> 00:55:51,480
might be set right.
Has nothing to do with wallowing in self

1099
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:52,314
pity.
I don't want to calculate high 

1100
00:55:55,201 --> 00:55:58,770
resolution utopia for myself,
only to have it squandered by fortune.

1101
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,980
How do I ensure the meaning I 
experienced a self determined?

1102
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:07,080
Well you can't because there's an 
arbitrary element to existence.

1103
00:56:07,081 --> 00:56:10,530
So it is going to be squandered to some 
degree by fortune,

1104
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,150
but that's,
that's not the point.

1105
00:56:12,151 --> 00:56:12,984
What are you going to do?
Just sit back on your laurels and wait 

1106
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:16,950
for things to roll over you.
So what you do,

1107
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:20,190
look,
the hero myth basically says,

1108
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:22,980
go out there,
confront the drag,

1109
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,970
get the gold,
share it with the community and,

1110
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,500
and live properly.
Or it says the alternative.

1111
00:56:29,501 --> 00:56:31,060
He has faced the tyrant.

1112
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,430
Enter the desert as a consequence 
because everything falls apart.

1113
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:38,050
Recast,
structure,

1114
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:38,943
find the promise land.
Those are the two elements to the hero 

1115
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:43,180
myth and you might,
and that's divine.

1116
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,340
It's the closest thing to divine that we
know.

1117
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:46,540
You might say,
well,

1118
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,570
what happens if you follow the divine 
path?

1119
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,400
And the answer might be,
well,

1120
00:56:51,401 --> 00:56:54,520
everything turns out perfectly because 
God is on your side.

1121
00:56:54,521 --> 00:56:55,354
It's like,
no,

1122
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,050
that isn't what happens because things 
don't turn out perfectly.

1123
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:02,620
It's your best bet.
It's your best strategy,

1124
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:04,540
right?
That's the thing.

1125
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:05,883
And you know,
dragons wouldn't be dragons if they 

1126
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:09,640
couldn't eat you.
And so,

1127
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:12,010
but that's okay.
That's okay.

1128
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:15,100
And this is something I found so useful 
about the biblical stories,

1129
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,113
especially about the abrahamic stories,
which I didn't know that well until I 

1130
00:57:18,041 --> 00:57:19,900
lectured about them last year.
You know,

1131
00:57:19,901 --> 00:57:22,960
God calls people to the adventure of 
their lives.

1132
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,080
And so you could say in part,
God is that force within you,

1133
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,570
which calls you to the adventure of your
life.

1134
00:57:28,571 --> 00:57:30,190
And it says,
get away from your family.

1135
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:31,203
Get away from your blind and unconscious
comfort and get the hell out there in 

1136
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,320
the world.
Well,

1137
00:57:35,321 --> 00:57:36,154
God calls Abraham out from his father's 
where he stayed far too long and from 

1138
00:57:39,221 --> 00:57:42,940
his kin where it's secure and like the 
first thing he encounters is a famine.

1139
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:43,953
And then he encounters a tyranny 
inhabited by people who want to steal 

1140
00:57:46,301 --> 00:57:47,980
his wife.
It's like you think,

1141
00:57:47,981 --> 00:57:49,390
well,
Keith Abraham,

1142
00:57:49,391 --> 00:57:52,600
he should have just stayed in bed and 
ignored God obviously.

1143
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:54,430
Well,
that isn't how it is.

1144
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:57,340
It's like we're built for struggle.
US human beings,

1145
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,650
you're not after the bubbles of blessed 
that does Dsq described in,

1146
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,770
in notes from underground.
We're built to contend with the world.

1147
00:58:05,771 --> 00:58:07,420
We're built to contend with reality.

1148
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:11,740
You want to challenge and the best way 
that you can take on a challenge because

1149
00:58:11,741 --> 00:58:13,000
it challenged,
fortifies you.

1150
00:58:13,001 --> 00:58:16,240
So you don't want to be secure.
You want to be strong and you get strong

1151
00:58:16,241 --> 00:58:17,074
by taking on optimal challenges.
And so you lay out your destiny in the 

1152
00:58:19,991 --> 00:58:20,824
world and you take the slings and arrows
of fate and you make yourself stronger 

1153
00:58:23,531 --> 00:58:24,364
while you're doing so.
And you might fail and fortune might do 

1154
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,840
you in.
But it's your best bet.

1155
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,033
And you know,
people have also people if that 

1156
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:36,580
extracted unbelievable successes out of 
catastrophic failures.

1157
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:39,700
And so,
and I'm not saying that in a naive way,

1158
00:58:39,701 --> 00:58:41,680
I know perfectly well what happens to 
people.

1159
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:42,543
You know,
you're doing fine in life and then you 

1160
00:58:43,661 --> 00:58:44,494
get cancer and then six months later 
your debt and all the heroism in the 

1161
00:58:47,651 --> 00:58:49,420
world isn't going to save you at that 
point.

1162
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,750
But that's not the point.
That's not the point.

1163
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:56,410
Life is bounded by mortality,
but that doesn't mean that you don't get

1164
00:58:56,411 --> 00:58:57,244
out there and contend and you develop by
contending and you minimize the net 

1165
00:59:00,821 --> 00:59:03,460
amount of suffering in the world.
And that's something,

1166
00:59:03,461 --> 00:59:04,660
man,
that's something to do.

1167
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:06,100
So it's,
it's,

1168
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:07,173
it beats laying in your basement and 
getting bitter and then doing the 

1169
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:14,970
terrible things that bitter people do.
So you can't ensure that the meaning you

1170
00:59:15,371 --> 00:59:16,204
experience his self determined,
but you can play your role to the best 

1171
00:59:19,661 --> 00:59:24,320
of your ability and that will be good 
enough and that will be good enough.

1172
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:25,503
That meaning the meaning that you all 
find in then in that I believe is 

1173
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:34,910
sufficient to be sustaining and perhaps 
even sustaining through the flood.

1174
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:38,240
So it isn't that you can avoid 
catastrophe,

1175
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:42,740
it's that you can prepare yourself to 
deal with it honorably when it arrives.

1176
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:43,880
That's what you've got.

1177
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:51,080
I have very high order lead ness and low
industriousness.

1178
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,850
23rd I have very high orderliness,
90th percentile,

1179
00:59:55,851 --> 00:59:58,430
low industriousness,
23rd percentile.

1180
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:00,860
What can I do to remedy this and get a 
higher industriousness?

1181
01:00:00,861 --> 01:00:01,790
Okay,
first of all,

1182
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,670
that's not that low.
Okay,

1183
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,620
we've got to think about percentiles 
here for a minute.

1184
01:00:06,621 --> 01:00:08,510
Cause they're not percentages.
They're different.

1185
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:12,080
So if you're at the 23rd percentile and 
there were four people in a room,

1186
01:00:12,081 --> 01:00:15,320
you'd be the least industrious of four 
of them and that kind of puts you in the

1187
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:17,660
average range.
It's not that big of deal.

1188
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:18,913
Um,
there's problems with it and we'll get 

1189
01:00:20,181 --> 01:00:21,380
to that,
although you may,

1190
01:00:21,381 --> 01:00:23,810
maybe you're high in openness to it 
anyways,

1191
01:00:23,811 --> 01:00:24,644
I won't get into that
low would be fifth percentile because 

1192
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:29,504
that makes you one in 20 or second 
percentile cause that makes you one in 

1193
01:00:32,271 --> 01:00:33,104
50.
It's kind of like interesting to v 

1194
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,273
visualize a fairly large high school 
class and then to think of yourself as 

1195
01:00:38,121 --> 01:00:39,050
situated in there.

1196
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,990
If you're the least industrious person 
out of 50,

1197
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:42,943
that's going to be a problem.
You better be smart or have some other 

1198
01:00:45,021 --> 01:00:48,290
things going for you because you're 
going to have a hard time being diligent

1199
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:50,630
enough to be successful.
Okay.

1200
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:51,853
Having said that,
so and maybe first percentile makes you 

1201
01:00:55,311 --> 01:00:59,120
one in a hundred and 0.0 0.1%.
It makes you one in a thousand.

1202
01:00:59,121 --> 01:01:01,100
So you got to think about percentiles 
property.

1203
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,830
Um,
so having said that,

1204
01:01:03,831 --> 01:01:05,540
let's say you're not very high and 
industriousness,

1205
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:07,220
what should you do?
A,

1206
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:09,650
make a damn plan.
Okay,

1207
01:01:09,651 --> 01:01:13,190
you need a plan for your life.
And I would say use the future authoring

1208
01:01:13,191 --> 01:01:16,550
program because that will help you make 
a plan or make a plan on your own.

1209
01:01:16,551 --> 01:01:17,384
That's fine.
Or make a plan because you talk to 

1210
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:19,850
someone.
But you know,

1211
01:01:19,851 --> 01:01:23,360
we put the future authoring program 
together to help people develop a vision

1212
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:28,280
of where they could be a counter vision 
to scare the hell out of them by helping

1213
01:01:28,281 --> 01:01:29,114
them think through how catastrophic 
things could become if they let all 

1214
01:01:31,311 --> 01:01:32,144
their stupidities get the upper hand and
then a second part of the program that 

1215
01:01:35,631 --> 01:01:36,740
helps you make a strategy.

1216
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:39,500
And we know the future authoring program
helps people,

1217
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:42,020
young men in particular who are doing 
worse.

1218
01:01:42,021 --> 01:01:43,670
By the way,
in academic situations,

1219
01:01:43,671 --> 01:01:44,504
it increases the probability that they 
will stay in college and university by 

1220
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:48,613
between 25 and 50%.
So make a damn plant and make when you 

1221
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:53,690
want.
Like don't make a plan.

1222
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:57,350
That is what you should do even though 
it will be what you should do.

1223
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:01,790
Make a plan that outlines a future so 
that you could sit back and say,

1224
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,250
look,
if I had that future,

1225
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:05,143
then all the horrible things that are 
going to happen to me are going to be 

1226
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:09,560
worthwhile.
That's what you want.

1227
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:13,580
Do you want to think this game is worth 
playing despite its tragedy?

1228
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:14,713
That's what you've got in life and now 
for meaning to serve as an antidote to 

1229
01:02:18,351 --> 01:02:19,184
tragedy.
All right now and then you generate a 

1230
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:22,074
strategy and then the other thing you 
should do if you're not very 

1231
01:02:23,911 --> 01:02:24,744
industrious,
industrious is disciplined yourself and 

1232
01:02:27,151 --> 01:02:28,320
so what do you do with that?

1233
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:32,250
Eat three times a day at regular meal 
times.

1234
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:33,293
That's a good thing to practice because 
that starts to put some stability into 

1235
01:02:36,241 --> 01:02:38,370
your life.
Get up at the same time.

1236
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:39,443
I would highly recommend all those young
people out there who are listening like 

1237
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,940
you want to get a jump on life,
get the hell out of bed in the morning.

1238
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:46,890
You know,
as I've got older,

1239
01:02:46,891 --> 01:02:47,724
I've got up earlier and earlier now.
That's partly because you don't need as 

1240
01:02:49,651 --> 01:02:50,484
much sleep,
but it's also partly because I've got 

1241
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:55,290
more and more disciplined.
Like get up early in the morning and get

1242
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:56,940
your things done,
man.

1243
01:02:57,090 --> 01:03:00,090
Learn to get up at six in the morning 
and you'll be one deadly creature,

1244
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:01,023
especially if you can get to work.
You'll have half your damn day down by 

1245
01:03:03,961 --> 01:03:06,480
the time other people haul their story 
houses out of bed.

1246
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,450
And so that's a massive,
massive advantage.

1247
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:13,920
Look will pharrel Warren Farrell,
not the comedian Warren Farrell,

1248
01:03:13,921 --> 01:03:17,880
the author.
He outlined data in why men earn more,

1249
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:19,650
which is a book I would recommend,
by the way,

1250
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,620
showing that if you work 13% longer 
hours,

1251
01:03:22,621 --> 01:03:25,820
you make 40% more money and it's 
nonlinear.

1252
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:27,120
So you think,
why is that?

1253
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:27,983
Well,
imagine you had 10 employees and one of 

1254
01:03:29,491 --> 01:03:33,180
them works and extra 10% it's not much.
Well,

1255
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:36,630
how often is that person going to be 
promoted,

1256
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:40,290
assuming you have a clue as a boss,
it's like you're going to look at the 10

1257
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:41,051
people and you gotta think,
well,

1258
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:43,650
that guy's always here like 45 minutes 
early.

1259
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:45,420
It's like,
why don't we give him the promotion,

1260
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,190
obviously,
right?

1261
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:48,024
So these tied these small edges that you
can manage like that work an extra 10% 

1262
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:56,040
extra,
13% have non-proportional payoffs.

1263
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,900
That's part of the parade.
Oh distribution.

1264
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:03,090
So get,
get your sleep cycle organized.

1265
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,980
So you get up in the morning,
learn how to do it.

1266
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,320
No excuses.
I'm too tired in the morning.

1267
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,480
I don't like mornings.
Who Cares?

1268
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,300
That's not relevant.
It's like discipline yourself so you can

1269
01:04:12,301 --> 01:04:13,134
manage it.
Schedule your meals cause that's a good 

1270
01:04:15,631 --> 01:04:16,464
disciplinary routine.
And then learn to use a calendar like 

1271
01:04:19,471 --> 01:04:20,880
Google calendar.
Most of you,

1272
01:04:20,881 --> 01:04:22,890
many of you out there do not use a 
calendar.

1273
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:24,023
Okay?
A calendar is not a prison and it's not 

1274
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:27,780
a tyrant,
not if you use it properly.

1275
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:29,183
A calendar keeps anxiety at bay.
It makes sure that you do what you need 

1276
01:04:32,941 --> 01:04:34,920
to do,
which is important because otherwise you

1277
01:04:34,921 --> 01:04:36,830
fall behind.
But if you use it property though,

1278
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,510
it's also helps you plan what you want 
to do.

1279
01:04:39,511 --> 01:04:40,550
So I could say,
well Leo,

1280
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:45,560
your damn calendar and designed the days
you would like to have.

1281
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,780
That's what your calendar is.

1282
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:48,990
Ha is four.
So you can put in all sorts of things in

1283
01:04:48,991 --> 01:04:51,330
there you want to do and that would be 
good for you.

1284
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:52,463
And that's a really good,
a really good way to start being more 

1285
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:57,330
industrious,
make a plan.

1286
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:01,890
You need a plan for three years,
you need a plan for the next year,

1287
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:03,720
you need to plan for the next six 
months,

1288
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:05,610
you need to plan for the next three 
months.

1289
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:09,090
You need a plan for the week,
you need a plan for the day,

1290
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:11,820
you need to plan for the hour,
all of that,

1291
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:12,923
all of that.
I make lists constantly of what I have 

1292
01:05:14,671 --> 01:05:16,800
to do and they're like daily,
weekly,

1293
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:18,070
monthly,
yearly.

1294
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,590
Right now I can't look out more than 
about six months,

1295
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:21,723
you know,
cause my life is too complicated and 

1296
01:05:22,691 --> 01:05:23,524
chaotic.
But,

1297
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:26,620
but you need a vision of who you could 
be,

1298
01:05:26,621 --> 01:05:29,140
what character you could have three to 
five years out.

1299
01:05:29,141 --> 01:05:33,280
You can't go much farther than that 
because life is too unpredictable.

1300
01:05:33,281 --> 01:05:34,114
I think to make vision,
that's longer term than that subject 

1301
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:39,634
too.

1302
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:44,380
There's too much chance associated with 
it to spend a lot of time on.

1303
01:05:44,381 --> 01:05:48,310
Maybe you can stretch it to five years 
and in rare cases you can have a 10 year

1304
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:50,680
goal,
but it has to be pretty low resolution.

1305
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,650
But you want plans at all those levels 
of resolution.

1306
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,200
You want to write the things down and 
what,

1307
01:05:56,201 --> 01:05:58,450
because what are you gonna do?
You're gonna Stumble around and get,

1308
01:05:58,451 --> 01:05:59,284
get what you need.
You're going to stumble around and be 

1309
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:01,624
useful to other people.
And it's useful to be useful to other 

1310
01:06:03,851 --> 01:06:04,684
people.
You know,

1311
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,570
they want to work with you,
then they want to do things with you.

1312
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,310
They want to have you around,
they trust you,

1313
01:06:09,311 --> 01:06:12,490
they open up opportunities for you.
And if you stumble around,

1314
01:06:12,491 --> 01:06:13,324
like you're blind,
you're not gonna get anywhere and then 

1315
01:06:14,741 --> 01:06:17,170
you're going to suffer and then you're 
going to be bitter and then you're going

1316
01:06:17,171 --> 01:06:18,004
to be cruel.

1317
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,110
So that's a bay.
That's hell.

1318
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:22,750
That's a bad outcome.
So unless you want that,

1319
01:06:22,751 --> 01:06:24,670
don't aim for it.
And or,

1320
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,100
or aim for the opposite because that's 
how you get out of it.

1321
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:28,293
So
physical attractiveness is extensively 

1322
01:06:31,781 --> 01:06:32,614
studied in departments of psychology.
How big of a determinant of success is 

1323
01:06:35,471 --> 01:06:38,140
it apart from Iq or any of the other big
five traits?

1324
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:41,260
Um,
that's tough.

1325
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:45,640
One because physical attractiveness is a
very complex trait.

1326
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,020
Um,
it's also,

1327
01:06:47,021 --> 01:06:47,854
for example,
it's a marker of health and of course 

1328
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:53,260
health is a mar is a prerequisite for 
success.

1329
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:54,550
So,
um,

1330
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:55,413
I you can't take attractiveness as a 
unitary dimension and measure it 

1331
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:02,480
sufficiently accurately.
Wait,

1332
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:07,150
I should back up on that.
No one that I know of has taken physical

1333
01:07:07,151 --> 01:07:07,984
attractiveness as a unitary concept,
measured it accurately and then pitted 

1334
01:07:12,311 --> 01:07:15,730
against Iq and the big five to see if 
it,

1335
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:16,833
to what degree it adds incremental 
validity to the prediction of longterm 

1336
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,880
success,
but physical,

1337
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:22,833
but,
and so I can't give you a technical 

1338
01:07:24,161 --> 01:07:24,640
answer.

1339
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,391
You know,
I can say,

1340
01:07:25,391 --> 01:07:26,224
well,
in a complex job over the long run Iq 

1341
01:07:28,331 --> 01:07:29,164
accounts for maybe 20% of the variance 
in success leaving 80% therefore random 

1342
01:07:34,391 --> 01:07:35,224
events and,
and the big five traits and connection 

1343
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:38,254
networks and,
and family background and all those 

1344
01:07:40,361 --> 01:07:43,450
other things,
gender perhaps that all the other things

1345
01:07:43,451 --> 01:07:45,890
that determine success,
physical a true,

1346
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:46,763
we know that physical,
that people who are physically 

1347
01:07:48,371 --> 01:07:51,610
attractive though are given the benefit 
of doubt by other people.

1348
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:52,863
They,
they benefit from the positive halo 

1349
01:07:54,551 --> 01:07:55,384
effect.
And the positive halo effect is the 

1350
01:07:56,441 --> 01:08:00,190
propensity of people to assume good 
things about someone.

1351
01:08:00,191 --> 01:08:03,760
If there is one outstanding thing about 
them that's easily evident,

1352
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:05,650
that's good.
And so if you're,

1353
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:07,053
if you're,
if you stand up straight with your 

1354
01:08:08,201 --> 01:08:09,034
shoulders back,
so that's rule one and 12 rules for 

1355
01:08:10,841 --> 01:08:12,520
life,
then people are going to see you as more

1356
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:14,200
attractive.
If you're symmetrical,

1357
01:08:14,201 --> 01:08:17,510
you're more attractive.
If you're thin but not too thin,

1358
01:08:17,511 --> 01:08:18,560
you're more attractive.

1359
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:22,690
Wow.
And then there's like good skin and good

1360
01:08:22,691 --> 01:08:26,500
teeth and good heroin and all of those 
things in proper proportions and youth.

1361
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:28,470
And there's a whole slew of things that,
that,

1362
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:29,503
that feed into that if you are 
characterized by a plethora of those 

1363
01:08:32,621 --> 01:08:33,454
features,
then people are also going to assume 

1364
01:08:34,481 --> 01:08:37,870
that you're more competent and more and 
more,

1365
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:41,680
more worth having around let's say.
But the problem is,

1366
01:08:41,681 --> 01:08:42,514
is that you are,
so separating out the attractiveness 

1367
01:08:45,911 --> 01:08:49,360
from the things the attractiveness are,
is correlated with is very hard.

1368
01:08:49,361 --> 01:08:51,940
That's why you have to do multivariate 
analysis.

1369
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:52,833
That's multivariable analysis in any 
complex social science because a lot of 

1370
01:08:56,951 --> 01:08:59,020
these traits overlap.
So,

1371
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:00,790
but you know,
you can,

1372
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:01,683
you can,
there's,

1373
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,940
there's some,
some things you can do about that.

1374
01:09:03,941 --> 01:09:07,480
Postural adjustment is helpful to work 
out with weights.

1375
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:10,090
That's extraordinarily helpful that that
increases,

1376
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,360
improves your posture and makes you more
confident and,

1377
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:13,510
and,
and,

1378
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:14,810
and,
and at,

1379
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:19,480
and you can dress reasonably well and 
intelligently and,

1380
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,420
um,
all of those things too,

1381
01:09:21,421 --> 01:09:25,360
to help yourself capitalize on whatever 
attractiveness you can muster.

1382
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:26,523
So

1383
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:33,550
what is your view on psychological 
egoism?

1384
01:09:33,551 --> 01:09:36,010
If we're all ultimately acting out of 
self interest,

1385
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:37,113
then does altruism have any merit?
I don't think the questions well post 

1386
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:41,613
and that's,
it's one of those questions that leads 

1387
01:09:42,701 --> 01:09:43,534
into a philosophical,
a dead end because it's not well post 

1388
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,223
you.
There isn't any such thing as self 

1389
01:09:48,731 --> 01:09:51,490
interest.
It's not the right way to think about it

1390
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:56,050
because you're not alone.
And so this is why like piaget,

1391
01:09:56,051 --> 01:10:01,051
John Piaget cause he thought about this 
intelligently look first of all who self

1392
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:05,230
interest you meet.
Do you mean your immediate self interest

1393
01:10:05,231 --> 01:10:07,330
in the next second.
So that would be impulsive pleasure.

1394
01:10:07,331 --> 01:10:08,164
We're all acting for the gaining of 
impulsive pleasure and to hell with 

1395
01:10:10,751 --> 01:10:11,584
everything else.
Well obviously that's a stupid way to 

1396
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:18,010
behave because everyone knows that 
because you can do impulsive,

1397
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,113
short term gratifying things like snort 
cocaine now and you can keep doing that 

1398
01:10:22,781 --> 01:10:23,614
and it pay off real,
real well in the extremely short term 

1399
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:30,850
and they'll just auger you into the 
ground in the medium to long term.

1400
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:34,240
So if you're acting in your own self 
interest,

1401
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:38,350
let's take that apart over what period 
of time.

1402
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:39,820
Okay.

1403
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:44,230
Your self interest in the next second.
You're self interest in the next hour.

1404
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:45,453
Like,
if you're impulsive and you want to 

1405
01:10:46,091 --> 01:10:46,924
gratify an impulse,
you're obviously acting in your self 

1406
01:10:48,641 --> 01:10:52,510
interest in the next second or the next 
two seconds or the next minute.

1407
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:54,040
But you know,
you'll pay for that.

1408
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,880
Maybe you punch someone or you slap 
someone cause you're so angry and they,

1409
01:10:57,881 --> 01:10:58,714
you know,
and they knock you for a loop and then 

1410
01:11:00,011 --> 01:11:02,860
they charge you with assault.
You know,

1411
01:11:02,861 --> 01:11:05,830
so well it was great in your self 
interest in the second,

1412
01:11:05,831 --> 01:11:09,640
but like future,
remember that simpsons episode,

1413
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:14,040
homer drank a quarter manet's and vodka 
and margin,

1414
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,080
all his kids were telling him not to and
he said,

1415
01:11:16,081 --> 01:11:19,710
well that's a problem for future homer.
I sure don't envy that guy.

1416
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,780
It's like,
which is one of the best Simpson's lines

1417
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:22,501
ever,
I think.

1418
01:11:22,501 --> 01:11:23,460
And well that's it.

1419
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:24,330
Exactly.
It's like,

1420
01:11:24,331 --> 01:11:26,310
well there isn't just you.
There's,

1421
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:31,230
there's now you and there's tonight you 
and there's tomorrow morning you,

1422
01:11:31,231 --> 01:11:33,360
that's the one that'll have the hangover
by the way.

1423
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:37,350
And there's next week you and next month
and next year you and old you.

1424
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,660
And so if you're going to act in your 
self interest,

1425
01:11:39,661 --> 01:11:40,494
you have to take that collective of use 
across time into account when you make 

1426
01:11:44,761 --> 01:11:45,594
your decision.
And now here's the cool thing about 

1427
01:11:47,461 --> 01:11:48,450
that.
So then that say,

1428
01:11:48,451 --> 01:11:51,180
well that would be acting in your self 
interest writ large,

1429
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:52,014
right across times pounds.
But the thing is future you and someone 

1430
01:11:56,371 --> 01:11:58,650
else that you have to live with right 
now that's not,

1431
01:11:58,651 --> 01:11:59,484
you are pretty much the same people.
And so if you're going to act in your 

1432
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:04,560
self interest and you have other people 
around you,

1433
01:12:04,561 --> 01:12:05,394
then you also want to act in their self 
interest because otherwise they won't 

1434
01:12:07,891 --> 01:12:08,724
like you,
they won't cooperate with you and they 

1435
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:12,420
won't compete with you in a reasonable 
manner.

1436
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:13,463
And so that's going to be a catastrophe.
And so you want to act out what's good 

1437
01:12:17,161 --> 01:12:20,670
for you now and what's good for you next
month and next year,

1438
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:22,163
and you want to do that in a way that's 
good for you and your family and your 

1439
01:12:24,421 --> 01:12:27,510
community right now,
next week and next year,

1440
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:30,840
and you're going to take all those 
things into account at the same time.

1441
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:34,320
That's an equivalent rated game from 
[inaudible] perspective,

1442
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:35,423
and it was his idea that that 
constituted the basis for proper moral 

1443
01:12:38,011 --> 01:12:41,640
judgment and it's a brilliant idea.
It's a brilliant idea.

1444
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:42,833
And so that's your true self interest.
There's no difference between your 

1445
01:12:45,751 --> 01:12:48,960
interest in the interest of others,
not in any fundamental sense,

1446
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:50,093
even your enemies,
which is why you're enjoying to treat 

1447
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:55,800
your enemy as if he was yourself,
because he is,

1448
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,061
you know,
and you think,

1449
01:12:57,061 --> 01:12:57,721
well,
you should wish,

1450
01:12:57,721 --> 01:12:59,520
well,
you should wish your enemies well.

1451
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:00,563
Well,
why?

1452
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,810
Well,
it isn't that you hope they get a bigger

1453
01:13:03,811 --> 01:13:05,520
house than you.
It's that.

1454
01:13:05,521 --> 01:13:06,354
Let's say you're,
you're being pursued and tormented by 

1455
01:13:08,101 --> 01:13:10,950
someone who's truly reprehensible.
That person is,

1456
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:12,540
they have a miserable life,
man.

1457
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:14,850
In all likelihood.
Let's say they're truly malevolent,

1458
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:16,283
you know they live in hell and what you 
might hope for them is that they could 

1459
01:13:19,501 --> 01:13:22,500
figure out how to get out of there cause
it's not good for them and it's not good

1460
01:13:22,501 --> 01:13:24,900
for anyone else think,
well even your enemies,

1461
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:25,734
it's like wouldn't it be good if they 
could get their act together and stop 

1462
01:13:27,721 --> 01:13:32,721
being so unnecessarily malevolent?
And that's in your self interest.

1463
01:13:33,091 --> 01:13:33,924
So the idea that your self interest is 
somehow opposed to other people's or 

1464
01:13:37,261 --> 01:13:38,094
that if you maximize yourself interest,
you're not operating in the best 

1465
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:42,893
interest of other people is predicated 
on a poor idea of what constitutes 

1466
01:13:46,231 --> 01:13:47,064
yourself interest.

1467
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:49,860
Cause you're not separate in any real 
sense from other people.

1468
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:53,340
You maybe not separate from everything 
in some real sense.

1469
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:54,990
You know,
I mean young,

1470
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:59,040
young in his book mysterium [inaudible] 
he had this idea,

1471
01:13:59,041 --> 01:14:03,360
I'm going to go through it real quick.
It's a complicated idea that this is how

1472
01:14:03,361 --> 01:14:06,190
you put yourself together.
The first thing you do is you,

1473
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:08,970
you join your emotions and your,
and your rationality.

1474
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:09,893
So that,
so that your mind and your emotions are 

1475
01:14:13,181 --> 01:14:15,250
one thing he called that the first 
conjunction.

1476
01:14:15,810 --> 01:14:16,643
Um,
so that your motivations and your 

1477
01:14:19,391 --> 01:14:20,224
emotions and the way that you think 
about the world are all acting in the 

1478
01:14:22,121 --> 01:14:23,560
same direction.
Okay?

1479
01:14:23,561 --> 01:14:26,110
So that's the first conjunction.
And you get your act together that way.

1480
01:14:26,111 --> 01:14:30,400
So that would mean incorporation of 
aggression and sexuality from a Freudian

1481
01:14:30,401 --> 01:14:32,530
perspective,
those parts of you that are difficult to

1482
01:14:32,531 --> 01:14:35,260
integrate come to be integrated into one
thing.

1483
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:36,573
So you can use your anger when you need 
to and you have your sexuality under 

1484
01:14:40,181 --> 01:14:41,530
control.
It doesn't have you,

1485
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:44,110
but you know how to use it.
And it's a power for you.

1486
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:46,150
Um,
and,

1487
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:49,150
and you're properly assertive in all of 
those things.

1488
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:49,984
And so you build yourself into one 
psychological unit and then you embody 

1489
01:14:53,051 --> 01:14:54,580
that.
So that's the second conjunction.

1490
01:14:54,581 --> 01:14:57,850
The second conjunction is take your 
mind,

1491
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,650
emotion,
motivation,

1492
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,170
unity,
and acted out,

1493
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:03,183
acted out in the world so that there's 
no distinction between you and what you 

1494
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:06,964
do between you and the way you think 
about the world and your philosophy and 

1495
01:15:09,791 --> 01:15:12,580
how you act.
That makes you a second kind of unity.

1496
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:15,790
And then the final conjunction,
which is the most difficult one,

1497
01:15:15,791 --> 01:15:19,330
is to stop thinking that the world is 
different than you are.

1498
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:23,650
This is why I ask people to clean up the
rooms just like your room is you,

1499
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:25,143
it's you.

1500
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:27,640
And so you go in there and you clean up 
your room,

1501
01:15:27,641 --> 01:15:30,910
your cleaning you up to the same way 
you're developing discipline,

1502
01:15:30,911 --> 01:15:31,744
you're putting yourself in order,
you're developing a vision of the 

1503
01:15:34,121 --> 01:15:36,190
future.
You're figuring out how to dress,

1504
01:15:36,191 --> 01:15:38,380
you're figuring out how to take care of 
your things.

1505
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:39,483
You're interacting with the micro cosmos
that you have in front of you and 

1506
01:15:42,551 --> 01:15:43,384
learning how to balance chaos and order.
There's no difference between you and 

1507
01:15:46,421 --> 01:15:47,254
what's around you.
And that's a very difficult thing to 

1508
01:15:49,091 --> 01:15:49,924
understand.
And so you want to act in a way that's 

1509
01:15:51,551 --> 01:15:53,710
good for you.
But good for everything else at the same

1510
01:15:53,711 --> 01:15:58,630
time and that's,
that's a high moral virtue and that,

1511
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:00,700
so there is there.

1512
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:03,283
Okay,

1513
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:04,203
that's the right way of thinking about 
the relationship between psychological 

1514
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:10,000
egoism and altruism.
It's like if you're,

1515
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:14,980
as you move towards a broader 
conceptualization of things,

1516
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:19,130
you start to understand that there is no
selfish selfish.

1517
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:24,070
There is no selfish self interest isn't 
how life works.

1518
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:26,410
Like if you're married to someone for 
example,

1519
01:16:26,411 --> 01:16:28,660
and you're stuck with them for the next 
50 years,

1520
01:16:28,661 --> 01:16:31,000
it's like you can't win an argument with
them.

1521
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:35,920
You can make peace because there you 
man,

1522
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:37,143
there you,
there are a huge part of your 

1523
01:16:38,621 --> 01:16:41,380
experience.
You have to treat that person as if they

1524
01:16:41,381 --> 01:16:43,630
are you.
And then if it's not,

1525
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,730
it isn't like,
well I'm going to treat you well because

1526
01:16:45,731 --> 01:16:46,564
you're me.
It's not because people don't treat 

1527
01:16:47,501 --> 01:16:48,334
themselves very well.
Often it's way more complicated than 

1528
01:16:50,501 --> 01:16:52,180
that.
You just,

1529
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,073
you don't want to defeat your wife man,
because then you live with a defeated 

1530
01:16:56,021 --> 01:16:58,600
wife and if you think she isn't going to
take revenge on you,

1531
01:16:58,601 --> 01:17:00,220
then you're,
you're not very bright.

1532
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:01,863
So you want to listen to what she has to
say and you want to listen to her 

1533
01:17:04,241 --> 01:17:05,074
problems and you want to help her solve 
them because she's you and you want to 

1534
01:17:08,381 --> 01:17:09,214
do the same with your kids and then you 
want to do the same with the people 

1535
01:17:11,151 --> 01:17:12,410
around you if you can do it.

1536
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:13,933
So and so the whole idea of like,
well we're basically wired to be 

1537
01:17:17,901 --> 01:17:21,620
selfish.
Well we are when we're not very wise and

1538
01:17:21,621 --> 01:17:26,450
we act impulsively.
But as your view of the world broadens,

1539
01:17:26,451 --> 01:17:30,520
you start to understand that this is why
in the Buddhist philosophy,

1540
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:31,354
no Buddha attained nirvana.
So that meant he could stay in union 

1541
01:17:33,951 --> 01:17:35,660
with the gods so to speak.
He,

1542
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:36,703
he attained the highest form of,
of subjective experience with might be 

1543
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:44,750
but which might be something like 
totally immersion in bliss and meaning.

1544
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:45,883
But he rejected it because he went back 
into the world to help other people 

1545
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:50,414
attain nirvana or at least to move 
towards it because he realized that 

1546
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:56,960
there was no individual redemption 
without the redemption of all.

1547
01:17:57,860 --> 01:17:59,840
And you,
if you don't understand that,

1548
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:00,674
then you're just not very wise.
And so you're trying to be a force for 

1549
01:18:03,591 --> 01:18:04,460
good in the world.

1550
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:06,950
And that doesn't mean just good for you.
That's just,

1551
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:12,310
it's just blind because there isn't any 
isolated you that isn't how things are,

1552
01:18:13,491 --> 01:18:14,324
that is now realities lays itself out.
So what is your current thinking on 

1553
01:18:19,311 --> 01:18:22,700
Orthodox Christianity?
The Orthodox Christians like me,

1554
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,270
I don't know why,
but I think I have some idea,

1555
01:18:26,271 --> 01:18:27,140
I guess.
Um,

1556
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:29,420
I've got a lot of letters from religious
people,

1557
01:18:29,421 --> 01:18:31,310
a lot of lot from,
from Muslims,

1558
01:18:31,311 --> 01:18:32,570
from Jews,
uh,

1559
01:18:32,571 --> 01:18:35,330
from Orthodox Jews in particular,
strangely enough,

1560
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:38,270
um,
from Christian monks,

1561
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,200
monks.
Um,

1562
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:43,010
but a lot from Orthodox Christians.
And I think the reason for that,

1563
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:43,844
as far as I can tell is that the 
Orthodox look at Christianity from a 

1564
01:18:48,441 --> 01:18:51,140
slightly different angle than the 
Protestants and the Catholics.

1565
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,330
And I'm not putting down the Protestants
and the Catholics,

1566
01:18:53,331 --> 01:18:55,670
they have a perspective,
a reason for their viewpoint.

1567
01:18:56,090 --> 01:18:59,390
But what's happened in the west,
I think,

1568
01:18:59,391 --> 01:19:01,280
and this is a dreadful over 
simplification,

1569
01:19:01,281 --> 01:19:06,281
so please forgive me,
is that the West has viewed Christianity

1570
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:08,443
more as a set of beliefs that are 
analogous in some sense to a cognitive 

1571
01:19:12,921 --> 01:19:14,060
theory of the world.

1572
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:15,193
So to be a Christian in the West,
you have to accept that Christ died for 

1573
01:19:18,441 --> 01:19:19,274
your sins and that you're redeemed.
So you have to accept Christ as your 

1574
01:19:22,461 --> 01:19:23,294
redeemer.
And that really means to state that you 

1575
01:19:25,581 --> 01:19:28,550
believe a set of propositions about 
Christ,

1576
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:32,600
that he was the son of God and that his 
death and resurrection,

1577
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:33,434
his sacrifice redeemed mankind and that,
and then you partake in that redemption 

1578
01:19:37,491 --> 01:19:41,930
by laying out that co that accordance 
with a set of facts,

1579
01:19:41,931 --> 01:19:43,490
let's say.
I don't,

1580
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,520
I understand why that's how it's worked 
out,

1581
01:19:46,521 --> 01:19:51,521
but I think there's a big risk in that.
And I don't think the Orthodox fell into

1582
01:19:51,711 --> 01:19:54,530
that to the same degree.
Their idea more,

1583
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:58,790
and this is their products in 
protestantism and Catholicism to,

1584
01:19:58,791 --> 01:19:59,750
it's there,
but it's,

1585
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,870
it's given more secondary,
more implicit emphasis.

1586
01:20:02,871 --> 01:20:05,090
And I think that's a problem,
especially in the modern world.

1587
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:06,583
There are Orthodox would say as near as 
I can tell that you should pick up your 

1588
01:20:10,081 --> 01:20:13,110
Damn Cross and stumble up the hill.
That's your job,

1589
01:20:13,170 --> 01:20:16,110
right?
And the cross is the x where everyone is

1590
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:18,240
located.
You're right at the center of reality,

1591
01:20:18,241 --> 01:20:19,074
your suffering and dying and being 
reborn all the time at the center of 

1592
01:20:22,021 --> 01:20:22,854
reality,
as you transform and you have to accept 

1593
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:26,370
that and embrace it,
you have,

1594
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:27,253
and that's very,
very hard thing to do because it means 

1595
01:20:28,921 --> 01:20:29,754
to embrace all your flaws and the flaws 
of reality and the tragedy of existence 

1596
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:36,240
and your death and the sum total of 
human evil,

1597
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,690
all of that unbelievably demanding

1598
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:43,280
requirement.
But you do what you can to do that.

1599
01:20:43,281 --> 01:20:46,130
And then not only do you pick up your 
cross so to speak,

1600
01:20:46,370 --> 01:20:49,160
but you stumble up hill towards the city
of God.

1601
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:54,230
Do you stumble up towards what's good 
and that's your destiny and that's where

1602
01:20:54,231 --> 01:20:55,064
meaning is to be had.
And the Orthodox lay that out quite 

1603
01:20:57,891 --> 01:20:58,724
well.
That's your goal is the imitation of 

1604
01:20:59,841 --> 01:21:03,440
Christ and Christ is the logos.
This is the Christian story.

1605
01:21:03,710 --> 01:21:04,543
Christ is the logos that God uses,
that the beginning of time to transform 

1606
01:21:07,401 --> 01:21:09,950
pre cosmic gone chaos into habitable 
order,

1607
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:12,530
truthful speech.
So that's the thing,

1608
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:13,693
you're,
you're the fact that you're capable of 

1609
01:21:15,771 --> 01:21:16,604
uttering truthful speech is an 
indication that you shouldered your 

1610
01:21:18,921 --> 01:21:22,190
cross and are stumbling up hill.
A very coherent theory.

1611
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:23,293
And the Orthodox I think have done a 
very good job of keeping that idea at 

1612
01:21:27,111 --> 01:21:29,780
the forefront of their,
of their belief.

1613
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:32,810
And so that's what I think about 
Orthodox Christianity.

1614
01:21:32,990 --> 01:21:35,630
Do I have any thoughts on the Myers 
Briggs personality test?

1615
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:37,310
Yes.
It's old.

1616
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:38,533
It isn't psychometrically valid.
It wasn't derived by factor analytic 

1617
01:21:41,361 --> 01:21:43,970
techniques.
It should be replaced by the big five or

1618
01:21:43,971 --> 01:21:44,804
the big five aspect scale,
which you can use if you go to 

1619
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:47,623
understand myself.
Dot Com we put it online for people to 

1620
01:21:49,581 --> 01:21:52,280
use and to generate a personality 
report.

1621
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:53,533
Um,
Myers and briggs attempted to make a 

1622
01:21:55,401 --> 01:21:56,234
questionnaire predicated on union 
presuppositions and perhaps they did a 

1623
01:21:59,031 --> 01:21:59,864
fine job for the 1930s,
but that was a long time ago and there 

1624
01:22:02,241 --> 01:22:03,074
weren't any powerful computational 
devices of the kind that were necessary 

1625
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:09,410
to sort out the structure of personality
properly,

1626
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:12,500
which we've managed to do since about 
1960 onward.

1627
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:13,633
So now the Myers Briggs is a perfectly 
useful tool if what you want to do is 

1628
01:22:17,601 --> 01:22:18,434
get people to talk about the fact that 
there are individual differences in 

1629
01:22:20,691 --> 01:22:21,524
personality and corporations love it 
because no one gets offended by it 

1630
01:22:24,921 --> 01:22:27,950
because everyone wins.
But if you want a personality tests that

1631
01:22:27,951 --> 01:22:31,190
actually tells you who you are that's 
valid and reliable,

1632
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:33,290
then you use the big five.
And,

1633
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,233
and that's that.
And so I would say the Myers Briggs 

1634
01:22:36,591 --> 01:22:37,424
should be relegated to the dustbins of 
the past because it's a defunct and 

1635
01:22:40,491 --> 01:22:43,250
archaic instrument and it's no longer 
properly valid.

1636
01:22:43,730 --> 01:22:45,230
And so,
um,

1637
01:22:46,850 --> 01:22:47,683
that's that.

1638
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,193
Yeah.

1639
01:22:56,890 --> 01:22:57,723
How can women who waited too long to 
have children find meaning in their 

1640
01:22:59,621 --> 01:23:03,400
lives once they realized their mistake?
How can we cope with the regret?

1641
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,290
Jesus.
That's a hard question.

1642
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,553
Well,
you know,

1643
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:15,070
there are other avenues to meaning,
right?

1644
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,710
I mean
that's,

1645
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:21,130
that's the first thing to realize is 
that there are,

1646
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:22,083
there's intimate relationship,
there's familial relationships that 

1647
01:23:25,451 --> 01:23:30,310
aren't in accordance with children.
There's other people that you can serve.

1648
01:23:30,370 --> 01:23:32,410
There are other children that you can 
serve.

1649
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:33,453
So what you have to do,
because intimate relationships are so 

1650
01:23:37,421 --> 01:23:40,150
important,
and I'm including that close familial,

1651
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:41,890
I'm not talking about sexual 
relationships,

1652
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:43,750
I'm talking about very close social 
relationships.

1653
01:23:43,751 --> 01:23:47,050
The thing about having children,
if you're lucky,

1654
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:51,580
is that you have a relationship there of
a depth that you don't get anywhere else

1655
01:23:51,581 --> 01:23:55,210
with the possible exception of your 
parents and siblings and your partner.

1656
01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:56,643
But there's something about the child 
relationship that's even more 

1657
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:00,093
fundamental because the thing about 
having a child is that if you have any 

1658
01:24:03,401 --> 01:24:05,200
sense,
as soon as you have a child,

1659
01:24:05,201 --> 01:24:07,060
you are no longer the most important 
person,

1660
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:07,750
right?

1661
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:10,660
You're no longer the person that you 
have primary responsibility for.

1662
01:24:10,661 --> 01:24:11,494
It's now your child.
And that produces a psychological 

1663
01:24:13,241 --> 01:24:14,074
transformation and it produces a 
relationship of a depth that can't be 

1664
01:24:16,631 --> 01:24:17,464
easily duplicated elsewhere.
But it's not like that's the only thing 

1665
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:22,150
that there is to do in life.
You know,

1666
01:24:22,151 --> 01:24:22,984
there,
there are other relationships and I 

1667
01:24:25,901 --> 01:24:26,734
would say what you do is you foster them
to the degree that that's possible and 

1668
01:24:29,321 --> 01:24:31,180
maybe you could find other kids to 
serve.

1669
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:32,403
You know,
there's always the possibility of 

1670
01:24:33,011 --> 01:24:35,110
volunteering for hospitals or,
or,

1671
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:38,230
or,
or working in places where children need

1672
01:24:38,231 --> 01:24:40,510
service.
So that's a possibility as well.

1673
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:43,390
And so you've,
you know,

1674
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:44,253
there are,
there are a variety of sources of 

1675
01:24:45,311 --> 01:24:48,640
meaning in people's lives and they're,
they're not unlimited.

1676
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:49,750
You know,
there's career,

1677
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:52,390
there's education,
there's what you do that's meaningful,

1678
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,340
meaningfully engages you outside of 
work.

1679
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:57,430
There's your social relations,
your friends and so forth.

1680
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:58,713
And so maybe you have five lakes lakes 
to stand on and you missed one cause he 

1681
01:25:01,691 --> 01:25:04,000
didn't have kids.
Or maybe you missed too because kids are

1682
01:25:04,001 --> 01:25:04,834
a big deal.
But that doesn't mean the rest of them 

1683
01:25:06,251 --> 01:25:07,084
aren't accessible to you.
And so you optimize your functioning 

1684
01:25:09,281 --> 01:25:11,500
along the dimensions that are left to 
you.

1685
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:16,180
And then I would also say maybe you try 
to forgive yourself a little bit.

1686
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:17,613
You know,
like it's very difficult to go through 

1687
01:25:18,911 --> 01:25:22,150
life without,
without regrets,

1688
01:25:22,151 --> 01:25:23,830
without making mistakes.
You know,

1689
01:25:23,831 --> 01:25:24,664
when you can't beat yourself to death 
for it because then everyone would beat 

1690
01:25:26,651 --> 01:25:29,770
themselves to death all the time.
And so you think,

1691
01:25:29,771 --> 01:25:32,400
well that's,
that's I've,

1692
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:33,243
I'm,
I'm too soon old and too late wise to 

1693
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:40,450
use an old cliche and you think,
well that's the lot of mankind.

1694
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:41,403
We learn things too late often and 
that's too bad and you forgive yourself 

1695
01:25:44,891 --> 01:25:47,890
because you're stupid and you don't know
what you're doing and you're unwise just

1696
01:25:47,891 --> 01:25:48,724
like everyone else.
And maybe you're somewhat capable of 

1697
01:25:50,321 --> 01:25:51,154
learning if you're careful.
And then you go out and you try to 

1698
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:57,820
foster relations and do good in the 
world to the degree that you can outside

1699
01:25:57,821 --> 01:26:00,610
of the necessity of,
of children.

1700
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:02,213
And maybe you have nephews,
nieces and can lavish some attention on 

1701
01:26:04,341 --> 01:26:07,310
them and find your substitute where you 
can.

1702
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:10,580
But I would say to forgive yourself is a
big part of that.

1703
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:13,340
It's like people make mistakes,
big mistakes.

1704
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:17,060
And the people that I've watched through
life that have been successful,

1705
01:26:17,061 --> 01:26:20,300
it's not like they didn't make mistakes 
because everyone makes mistakes and they

1706
01:26:20,301 --> 01:26:21,134
do things they regret and they miss 
opportunities and it's a bloody 

1707
01:26:23,361 --> 01:26:24,194
catastrophe.
But they treat themselves with some 

1708
01:26:27,621 --> 01:26:29,480
degree of mercy along with the justice.

1709
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:30,081
It's like,
yeah,

1710
01:26:30,081 --> 01:26:30,914
well I screwed up there and I'm going to
try to learn and I'm not going to do it 

1711
01:26:33,501 --> 01:26:34,334
again,
but I'm not going to beat myself to 

1712
01:26:35,601 --> 01:26:36,434
death so that I can't get up again.
And so you do what you can to forgive 

1713
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:41,120
yourself.
You know,

1714
01:26:41,121 --> 01:26:41,954
it's a confusing time to live in in many
ways because we have the birth control 

1715
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:49,040
pill now and that means reproduction has
now become voluntary.

1716
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,740
Well,
when's a good time to reproduce?

1717
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:52,903
Well,
never,

1718
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:55,730
because who would ever think about doing
that?

1719
01:26:55,731 --> 01:26:56,564
It's so ridiculously irrational and 
complicated and the burden of 

1720
01:27:00,321 --> 01:27:04,010
responsibility is so insanely high and 
you never secure enough to,

1721
01:27:04,190 --> 01:27:05,023
to have the proper place to bring 
children into the world and you have to 

1722
01:27:07,851 --> 01:27:11,450
get your career going and your and your 
intimate relationship.

1723
01:27:11,451 --> 01:27:13,070
And maybe you have some struggle doing 
that.

1724
01:27:13,071 --> 01:27:14,900
And one day you wake up and it's a bit 
late.

1725
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:15,831
It's like,
yeah,

1726
01:27:15,831 --> 01:27:16,664
well you're a product of your time and 
one of the prices that we're going to 

1727
01:27:22,701 --> 01:27:23,534
pay for having birth control for having 
reliable contraception is that some 

1728
01:27:28,461 --> 01:27:29,294
people are going to make the wrong 
decision with regards to having 

1729
01:27:31,791 --> 01:27:32,624
children.
And then you view yourself as a product 

1730
01:27:34,401 --> 01:27:36,080
of your time.
And that's a catastrophe,

1731
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,033
you know,
because to be a product of your time is 

1732
01:27:38,391 --> 01:27:40,820
in some ways a catastrophe.
So,

1733
01:27:41,650 --> 01:27:44,570
but there's other things to do in life 
and,

1734
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:48,350
and augering yourself into the ground 
with regret and,

1735
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:49,610
and,
and,

1736
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:54,350
and self recrimination is not useful.
Right?

1737
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:55,730
I mean,
you have to learn your lesson,

1738
01:27:55,731 --> 01:27:57,260
you have to take your lumps,
all of that,

1739
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,680
but have some mercy.
You know?

1740
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:03,553
That's it.
You have said that the only moral 

1741
01:28:07,971 --> 01:28:11,360
absolute is always to tell the truth.
What if you have anne frank in the attic

1742
01:28:11,361 --> 01:28:13,220
and the Gestapo at your on your 
doorstep,

1743
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:14,203
then I would say that there has been a 
lot of lies that have got you to that 

1744
01:28:16,881 --> 01:28:17,714
point.
So you may be in a situation where 

1745
01:28:20,361 --> 01:28:23,630
you're damned if you turn right and 
you're damned if you turn left.

1746
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,660
And what that means is you made a lot of
mistakes along the way.

1747
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:28,393
You know,
so if the totalitarians or knocking at 

1748
01:28:30,261 --> 01:28:31,094
your door,
if the totalitarians or knocking on 

1749
01:28:32,331 --> 01:28:34,820
everyone's door,
that means everyone should have spoke up

1750
01:28:34,821 --> 01:28:35,654
a lot sooner.
And then they wouldn't end up in a 

1751
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:41,020
situation where the Gestapo was out the 
door and Anne Frank was in the owl is it

1752
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:41,893
was in the attic.
So you now and then you end up in a 

1753
01:28:45,531 --> 01:28:46,364
situation where you've made so many 
mistakes that all you've got is hell 

1754
01:28:49,071 --> 01:28:49,904
around you.

1755
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,220
And that was certainly the case in 
Amsterdam say,

1756
01:28:52,221 --> 01:28:55,210
or and in,
in when the Nazis came in on,

1757
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:56,053
I mean the Dutch are now admirable 
people and I know they were invaded by 

1758
01:28:58,791 --> 01:29:01,740
the Nazis and that was a terrible thing.
But many,

1759
01:29:01,741 --> 01:29:02,311
many,
many,

1760
01:29:02,311 --> 01:29:03,144
many,
many people made many terrible moral 

1761
01:29:05,041 --> 01:29:05,874
errors for all of that to occur.
And you have to be awake and do 

1762
01:29:09,001 --> 01:29:11,090
everything you can to make sure your 
society doesn't.

1763
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:13,200
This is the answer.
You be away.

1764
01:29:13,201 --> 01:29:17,640
Can you make sure everything you society
does doesn't lead to the point where the

1765
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:21,360
Gestapo at your doorstep and you have 
Anne Frank in the attic,

1766
01:29:21,361 --> 01:29:23,970
it's a little late to be thinking.
Then I would say,

1767
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:35,090
well I have confidence in an opinion 
when it could be wrong.

1768
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:37,800
Well partly because it could be right.
You know what?

1769
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:40,580
That's why it's better to think about 
opinions as tools,

1770
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:41,923
you know or maybe to dispense with 
opinions altogether because who cares 

1771
01:29:44,811 --> 01:29:45,644
about your stupid opinion but what you 
want is tools to work in the world and 

1772
01:29:49,311 --> 01:29:50,990
you think,
well I have a tool and it might work.

1773
01:29:50,991 --> 01:29:54,530
So like let's say that you're going into
negotiate with someone while you're your

1774
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:55,433
tool kit is your conceptual,
the conceptual structure and the habits 

1775
01:29:58,461 --> 01:29:59,294
that you have that enable you to 
construe the situation and to conduct 

1776
01:30:01,641 --> 01:30:03,290
the negotiation.
Well,

1777
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:08,330
you have to have confidence that your,
that your tool kit is appropriate or you

1778
01:30:08,331 --> 01:30:09,830
wouldn't go out there and test it and 
you'd say,

1779
01:30:09,831 --> 01:30:10,670
well,
I might be wrong.

1780
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:11,151
It's like,
yeah,

1781
01:30:11,151 --> 01:30:12,470
but you're not going to learn if you're 
wrong.

1782
01:30:13,490 --> 01:30:16,850
Unless you go out there and test it.
So you have to have provisional.

1783
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:18,640
Okay

1784
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:21,860
look,
let's say that you're um,

1785
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:23,313
well let's say that you're using a 
hammer to hammer in a nail and you 

1786
01:30:25,841 --> 01:30:26,674
think,
well,

1787
01:30:27,310 --> 01:30:28,143
am I going to hit the nail?
Well you aim at the nail and you hit it 

1788
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:32,350
and you watch.
And if you didn't hit it quite right,

1789
01:30:32,351 --> 01:30:33,820
then you aim a little different.
You know,

1790
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:36,250
so you have enough confidence to swing 
the hammer.

1791
01:30:36,251 --> 01:30:38,500
But that doesn't mean you're not paying 
attention to the outcome.

1792
01:30:38,890 --> 01:30:42,160
So you want to have confident,
and maybe this is the best answer,

1793
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:44,800
you don't want to have confidence in the
opinion.

1794
01:30:44,801 --> 01:30:45,634
Exactly.
You want it how you want to believe in 

1795
01:30:47,141 --> 01:30:50,950
the necessity of moving forward in the 
world with your limited tool kit.

1796
01:30:51,850 --> 01:30:52,930
And also

1797
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:56,683
you want to make the the vow.
Let's say that as you implement your 

1798
01:31:00,321 --> 01:31:01,154
tools in the world,
that you're going to pay attention to 

1799
01:31:02,661 --> 01:31:06,920
what happens and you're going to modify 
them as necessary as you move along.

1800
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:09,110
That's the adoption of the hero myth 
again,

1801
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:10,430
cause that's,
you know,

1802
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:11,293
let's say your opinion is a little 
screwy and so you laid out in the world 

1803
01:31:13,851 --> 01:31:16,100
and you get responses that aren't 
positive.

1804
01:31:16,101 --> 01:31:17,170
It's like you think,
oh,

1805
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:18,830
okay,
well that didn't work out quite right.

1806
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:22,070
I'll go retool my opinion.
And so you,

1807
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:25,430
you move out into the world,
not as a collection of opinions,

1808
01:31:25,431 --> 01:31:30,431
but as a collection of tools and as the 
process that can re cast those tools.

1809
01:31:34,550 --> 01:31:35,331
And then you think,
well,

1810
01:31:35,331 --> 01:31:38,540
it's not so much that I have confidence 
in my opinions.

1811
01:31:38,541 --> 01:31:41,690
I have,
I know that they're necessary to express

1812
01:31:41,691 --> 01:31:45,530
them because sometimes the work and if 
they don't work then I can learn.

1813
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:46,783
And that's,
and that's the recipe for forthright 

1814
01:31:49,701 --> 01:31:50,534
action in the world.

1815
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:52,533
Okay.

1816
01:31:52,670 --> 01:31:55,310
Our daughter entered her life at 24 due 
to depression.

1817
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,410
If someone is determined to end their 
life,

1818
01:31:57,470 --> 01:31:59,000
how can one change their mind?
Oh,

1819
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:02,380
first of all,
I'm very sorry about that.

1820
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:07,560
That's a terrible thing.
Look,

1821
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:14,330
I had this friend
her,

1822
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:22,503
sorry.
There's been a lot of depression in our 

1823
01:32:29,271 --> 01:32:30,104
family.
So it's a question that cuts close to 

1824
01:32:32,961 --> 01:32:33,794
the bone.

1825
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:35,883
Okay.

1826
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:39,990
Anyways,
I had this friend,

1827
01:32:40,850 --> 01:32:44,270
a friend of my parents and her grand 
daughter committed suicide,

1828
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:45,123
you know,
she was just beating herself up about 

1829
01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:50,490
what could have I done,
what could have I done differently?

1830
01:32:50,491 --> 01:32:54,330
This is the problem with suicide leaves 
everybody behind thinking,

1831
01:32:54,331 --> 01:32:55,980
Oh my God,
what could've I done?

1832
01:32:56,130 --> 01:32:58,410
I could have treated the person better.
I could have listened.

1833
01:32:58,411 --> 01:32:59,970
I could've been there.
It's like,

1834
01:32:59,971 --> 01:33:00,804
and she was just beating yourself up 
about this really feeling that she 

1835
01:33:04,051 --> 01:33:07,050
wasn't a useful person,
that she'd failed as a grandmother.

1836
01:33:07,230 --> 01:33:08,790
She's a really good person,
you know?

1837
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:11,370
And so I went for a walk with her and I 
said,

1838
01:33:12,030 --> 01:33:14,610
she's married and she likes her husband 
and he's a really good guy.

1839
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:17,370
And I said,
look,

1840
01:33:18,610 --> 01:33:20,790
you're,
you're blaming yourself for the,

1841
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:22,890
for your granddaughter,
suicide.

1842
01:33:23,610 --> 01:33:25,080
It's like,
are you blaming your husband?

1843
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:28,050
Are you sitting him down and telling him
what to use?

1844
01:33:28,110 --> 01:33:28,943
Useless bastard.
He was as a grandfather because his 

1845
01:33:30,751 --> 01:33:33,630
grand daughter committed suicide and how
he failed completely.

1846
01:33:34,410 --> 01:33:34,981
She said,
no,

1847
01:33:34,981 --> 01:33:37,230
I'd never do that.
So I said,

1848
01:33:37,231 --> 01:33:41,660
well,
don't do it to yourself.

1849
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:44,733
No people.
Depression was a terrible thing and 

1850
01:33:49,091 --> 01:33:49,901
many,
many,

1851
01:33:49,901 --> 01:33:52,300
many things cause it and we don't 
understand.

1852
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:55,060
We understand some of them,
but lots of them,

1853
01:33:55,061 --> 01:33:56,260
we don't understand it all.
You know,

1854
01:33:56,261 --> 01:33:58,720
sometimes people get depressed because 
they're really sick.

1855
01:33:59,980 --> 01:34:02,560
We know that depression could be an 
inflammatory disease,

1856
01:34:02,561 --> 01:34:05,110
it might be associated with audio,
immune dysfunction.

1857
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:08,610
There's lots of reasons that people get 
depressed and depressed.

1858
01:34:08,611 --> 01:34:12,130
People can go places that are so dark,
you just cannot imagine it.

1859
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:16,480
And it isn't necessarily the case that 
you can always rescue someone,

1860
01:34:16,481 --> 01:34:18,430
you know,
and but,

1861
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:22,390
but drowning yourself in the aftermath 
of a suicide is not helpful.

1862
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:25,630
So there's a,
there's a good room for self forgiveness

1863
01:34:25,631 --> 01:34:26,231
there.
You know,

1864
01:34:26,231 --> 01:34:27,064
I mean maybe you did some things you 
shouldn't have done that were 

1865
01:34:29,411 --> 01:34:32,560
reprehensible in all of that,
but you don't want to beat yourself up.

1866
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:35,560
Remember the presumption of innocence,
right?

1867
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:39,730
Innocent until proven guilty and you 
have to apply that to yourself.

1868
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:41,373
I don't think.
I think there are times when people are 

1869
01:34:43,691 --> 01:34:46,090
so depressed there,
there isn't anything that anyone can do.

1870
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:48,670
You know when the depressed person 
thinks,

1871
01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:50,530
and this is probably the worst part of 
it,

1872
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:54,970
the depressed person thinks

1873
01:34:58,180 --> 01:34:59,013
everywhere I look,
it's nothing but catastrophe and 

1874
01:35:01,621 --> 01:35:03,690
there's,
I can't see any way out of it.

1875
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:08,430
I can't see any path forward whatsoever.
And then they think as well,

1876
01:35:08,431 --> 01:35:09,264
and maybe it's the combination of these 
two thoughts that that really make 

1877
01:35:11,521 --> 01:35:14,040
people suicidal.
It's like it's hopeless.

1878
01:35:14,730 --> 01:35:17,310
It isn't going to get any better.
No matter where I turn.

1879
01:35:17,311 --> 01:35:18,144
There's no escape.
The suffering is unbearable and I have 

1880
01:35:21,330 --> 01:35:23,580
absolutely no use whatsoever.
Do anyone.

1881
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:27,300
It would be better for everyone if I was
just gone because I'm going,

1882
01:35:27,330 --> 01:35:31,170
if I'm not so much of a burden now that 
it's going to destroy their life,

1883
01:35:31,171 --> 01:35:35,280
then I'm going to be that much of a 
burden in the future.

1884
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:39,540
And so it's hard to imagine what that's 
like for people,

1885
01:35:39,541 --> 01:35:44,220
but it's dreadful and there's lots of 
ways you get there and so

1886
01:35:45,870 --> 01:35:46,703
you can listen to people.
You can desperately encouraged them to 

1887
01:35:50,101 --> 01:35:51,120
seek the help they need.

1888
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:51,953
You know,
like I've,

1889
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:54,540
I've seen antidepressants work miracles 
on very,

1890
01:35:54,541 --> 01:35:57,450
very many people now.
They don't work for everyone and they're

1891
01:35:57,451 --> 01:36:00,140
not a panacea,
but you know,

1892
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:03,960
they have side effects and all of that.
But one of the side effects of untreated

1893
01:36:03,961 --> 01:36:07,110
depression is that you kill yourself and
there is no recovery from that.

1894
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:10,560
And the are,
the probability is actually rather high.

1895
01:36:11,190 --> 01:36:15,180
So you can go to war with them about 
antidepressants.

1896
01:36:15,181 --> 01:36:17,460
If the person can't get out of their 
depression and their,

1897
01:36:17,580 --> 01:36:18,960
and their suicidal,
it's like,

1898
01:36:18,990 --> 01:36:22,080
what did they have to lose one month on 
antidepressants?

1899
01:36:22,590 --> 01:36:24,000
They'll know,
oh,

1900
01:36:24,030 --> 01:36:26,520
they might have to experiment longer 
because it would depend on,

1901
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:27,383
you know,
some people respond better to some 

1902
01:36:28,261 --> 01:36:30,210
classes of antidepressants than the 
others.

1903
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:31,753
Um,
it's worth having a war with someone if 

1904
01:36:34,441 --> 01:36:37,680
they're in dire straits and they won't 
do everything they can to get better.

1905
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:38,873
ECT works.
Electric convulsive therapy works for 

1906
01:36:40,801 --> 01:36:43,770
intractable depression.
It's a terrible thing to contemplate,

1907
01:36:43,771 --> 01:36:47,820
but the modern versions of ect aren't 
one flew over the cuckoo's nest.

1908
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:48,773
And again,
it's like there's no coming back from 

1909
01:36:50,461 --> 01:36:54,590
death.
So look,

1910
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:56,930
it isn't clear.
You can't rescue everyone.

1911
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:01,940
People get sick and they die,
and sometimes the way they die,

1912
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:07,010
it looks like it's depression.
Depression is a multifaceted phenomena.

1913
01:37:07,850 --> 01:37:09,770
You can be there for them.
You can listen,

1914
01:37:10,670 --> 01:37:12,950
you can watch,
you can intervene,

1915
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:17,180
you can try to understand,
you can hold them accountable.

1916
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:21,830
You can do all of those things but that,
but everyone has their own destiny,

1917
01:37:21,831 --> 01:37:25,730
you know,
and you're not omnipotent.

1918
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:31,370
And so sometimes it catastrophe occurs 
like your daughters and

1919
01:37:34,170 --> 01:37:35,003
then,

1920
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:36,973
and then you should try to drag the 
least amount of misery forward that you 

1921
01:37:39,711 --> 01:37:44,711
can
once you recover from your grief.

1922
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:48,713
Yup.

1923
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:56,980
I'm going to answer one more question.
Due to a recent incident.

1924
01:37:58,131 --> 01:38:00,740
My company is making me undergo implicit
bias training.

1925
01:38:00,980 --> 01:38:04,100
How should I come to terms with my 
possible firing when I refuse?

1926
01:38:07,930 --> 01:38:08,763
Look,

1927
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:12,830
there's no sense in burning yourself at 
the steak.

1928
01:38:13,940 --> 01:38:14,773
You know,
if you're going to take a principled 

1929
01:38:15,951 --> 01:38:19,610
stance on something at work and you're 
going to refuse,

1930
01:38:20,090 --> 01:38:20,923
you have to get your tools in order.
You have to get your quiver full of 

1931
01:38:24,951 --> 01:38:26,660
arrows.
You know,

1932
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,720
what the hell good is it going to be for
you just to get fired?

1933
01:38:30,020 --> 01:38:31,910
I maybe have a family that depends on 
you.

1934
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:33,223
That's not helpful.
That doesn't mean I think you should be 

1935
01:38:35,031 --> 01:38:37,520
weak because you have a family.
You should be stronger.

1936
01:38:38,030 --> 01:38:40,370
I would say.
Is your resume in order?

1937
01:38:40,490 --> 01:38:42,290
Is Your CV in order?
Is it updated?

1938
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:45,560
Have you sent out other job 
applications?

1939
01:38:45,561 --> 01:38:48,080
Are you prepared?
Do you have a lateral move?

1940
01:38:48,530 --> 01:38:50,300
Like this is a war,
not a battle.

1941
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:51,613
And you don't want to lose.
And so set yourself up and then make 

1942
01:38:55,221 --> 01:38:57,020
your case.
And when you make your case,

1943
01:38:57,021 --> 01:38:59,300
don't apologize,
but don't do it carelessly.

1944
01:38:59,870 --> 01:39:00,703
You know you,
you need a lateral move because 

1945
01:39:03,201 --> 01:39:05,960
otherwise you're too exposed.
So,

1946
01:39:07,290 --> 01:39:12,290
and if you're going to refuse,
have your arguments at at hand,

1947
01:39:13,910 --> 01:39:15,350
you know,
have them in writing.

1948
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:18,200
Make sure that you share them with the 
appropriate people.

1949
01:39:18,350 --> 01:39:20,300
Don't make unnecessary enemies

1950
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:26,510
and do yourself the least amount of harm
possible.

1951
01:39:26,660 --> 01:39:29,180
Now look,
having said that,

1952
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:30,710
you know,
so you're going to,

1953
01:39:31,510 --> 01:39:32,570
you know,
you're going to pay,

1954
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:34,843
you're either going to pay and you're 
going to go do implicit bias training 

1955
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:40,340
and you're going to sell a bit of your 
soul to do that.

1956
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:44,030
Are you going to pay because you're 
going to refuse and you're going to take

1957
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:46,160
that price.
So you got priced to pay both ways.

1958
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:49,070
If you're going to refuse,
do it intelligently,

1959
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:52,310
do it programmatically.
Do it philosophically.

1960
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:54,500
Do it strategically,
right?

1961
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:56,810
Stupid martyrdom is just stupid 
martyrdom.

1962
01:39:56,870 --> 01:39:57,703
It's not helpful.
So there may be people you need to talk 

1963
01:40:00,531 --> 01:40:01,364
to.
There may need to be more than one of 

1964
01:40:02,571 --> 01:40:03,770
you,
you know,

1965
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:07,340
so you may need to make contact with the
press.

1966
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:11,000
Like you got to be strategic about this.
You got to be intelligent about it.

1967
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:12,013
You don't want to just let yourself in 
fire and out of protest because maybe 

1968
01:40:15,231 --> 01:40:16,064
there'll just be a pile of ashes that 
people sweep up and go on with their 

1969
01:40:18,141 --> 01:40:19,730
idiocy.
So,

1970
01:40:23,140 --> 01:40:24,880
all right,
everyone.

1971
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:27,240
Okay.

1972
01:40:27,240 --> 01:40:29,400
Nice talking with you all.
Thank you for the questions.

1973
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:32,640
Um,
come and see me if you want.

1974
01:40:32,910 --> 01:40:35,280
If you go to Jordan Peterson,
Jordan B.

1975
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:37,740
Peterson Dotcom,
you can see the upcoming events.

1976
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:39,120
Um,
they've gone,

1977
01:40:39,150 --> 01:40:39,983
they've been going real well.
I'll talk about my book and about all 

1978
01:40:42,031 --> 01:40:43,380
the other things that I'm thinking 
about,

1979
01:40:43,381 --> 01:40:44,214
or not all of them,
but some of the other things that I'm 

1980
01:40:45,241 --> 01:40:48,150
thinking about am I tried to make every 
talk different.

1981
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:49,501
Um,
even though,

1982
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:50,334
you know,
the outline is the same cause I'm 

1983
01:40:51,151 --> 01:40:53,100
talking about my book.
Um,

1984
01:40:55,810 --> 01:40:58,780
I guess that's about it.
Thank you for all the patrons support.

1985
01:40:59,140 --> 01:41:01,660
I know it's been a little while since 
this last q and a.

1986
01:41:01,980 --> 01:41:04,240
Um,
that's life,

1987
01:41:04,270 --> 01:41:06,370
I guess at the moment.
Um,

1988
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:09,250
and I'll try to do one within the next 
month.

1989
01:41:09,251 --> 01:41:11,440
I'm on the road law.
They'll probably do it with my laptop.

1990
01:41:11,830 --> 01:41:13,330
So,
um,

1991
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:18,720
what should I say in closing?
Get your act together much as you can.

1992
01:41:19,031 --> 01:41:19,864
There's things to do in the world and it
would be good if everyone was out there 

1993
01:41:23,021 --> 01:41:26,650
doing them with see how we could beat 
this old globe back into some reasonable

1994
01:41:26,651 --> 01:41:28,630
shape or into better shape than it's 
ever been.

1995
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:31,300
That would be lovely thing to do.
So

1996
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:33,790
goodbye for now.
