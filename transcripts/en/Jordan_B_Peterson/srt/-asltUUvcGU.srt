1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,040
[inaudible].

2
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,413
Yeah.
Sending this one out to my evolutionary 

3
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:29,490
psychology people.
Yeah.

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,030
David bus.
Cosmic in Tubey.

5
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,980
Yeah.
Jeffrey Miller.

6
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,323
Yeah.
We live in this till the day that we 

7
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:38,214
die.
Survival or the feet only the strong 

8
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:44,070
survive.
There's walk and went on outside.

9
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:47,490
No Man is safe.
You can run but you can't have ever,

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,060
you come to my black,
you'll see some territoriality.

11
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,400
You please wear a kill or be killed is 
the mentality would get his street.

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,280
It's just a necessary strategy.
You got to play the hand.

13
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:57,570
You're dealt.
What can magic?

14
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:58,404
We escaped from the habitat that she was
born in three homicides and when 

15
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:05,490
neighborhood is cops came and kicked the
crooked door with no warning.

16
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,453
I started roughing up my young cousins.
She's only 17 and counterpoint in the 

17
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:12,810
oven plus a concussion,
but she ain't done nothing.

18
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:13,763
So keep your mouth shut.
Don't jump to judgment on the lads were 

19
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:16,620
living.

20
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,150
Just close your eyes and listen with 
that.

21
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:20,130
Pre counsel.
Homicide statistics.

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,950
So if you think the criminal man,
it's just bacon,

23
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,830
you're mistaken.
This is calculated risk taking.

24
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,723
We did banana situation with the low 
life expectancy and a major discrepancy 

25
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:31,554
between the haves and the have nots.
And You wonder why the padlock on every 

26
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,210
cashbox smashed off.
Come on.

27
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,460
You can't call a pathological.
Nah,

28
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:40,710
that's a logical,
you can try to understand it,

29
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:41,544
but you can't stop a doe.
Not Unless you address the root causes 

30
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:48,180
is the conscious and unconscious 
decisions to discount future prospects.

31
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,333
C'Mon,
it's obvious the beekeeper bouncing 

32
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,930
homicide rate keeps mounting,
which leaves this deep discounting and a

33
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:56,460
lot of violence,
but it's not.

34
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:57,294
A virus is a rational response to high 
risk environments and short time 

35
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,374
horizons with high stakes and highly 
visible prizes and you wonder why we're 

36
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:05,370
criminal minded.

37
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,080
Hey,
you can't say we'll get satisfaction and

38
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:08,914
for patient with self control and delete
gratification when the only job that 

39
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:12,924
pays his casket baking death is the 
ultimate plan cancellation to check the 

40
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:17,664
facts and recent data release.
It shows a pattern of increasing 

41
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:20,814
competition,
a bunch of young guys off struggling 

42
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,693
status seeking,
causing the crabs and make the social 

43
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:29,520
fabric weekend and life expectancy also 
predicts teen pregnancy.

44
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,503
The need to leave a legacy genetically 
will never be completely control 

45
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:34,140
contraceptive.
The,

46
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:35,280
yeah,
the transparent.

47
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,353
Imagine if your kids would never meet 
the grandparents unless they followed 

48
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:43,100
the Bristol Pailin Plan for parenthood 
and then they see these young girls were

49
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:43,934
fall down.
Carolyn's do get pregnant before 

50
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:47,490
marriage is such a tragedy.
Apparently.

51
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:48,324
It's also a reproductive strategy,
especially when you could see them 

52
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:53,160
adjusting activity when their 
circumstances change.

53
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,820
In both the cases of the young ladies 
with babies in the mail risk takers,

54
00:02:56,821 --> 00:03:00,280
you see people that depth into their 
situation and it's the same in different

55
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,660
places and with different reasons.

56
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,860
This is not about ethical justification.
It's evolutionary psych in,

57
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:07,450
it's just the basics.
I'm still,

58
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:08,284
people call this behavior maladaptive 
because of our reaction when violence 

59
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:12,244
happens,
but if we really want to change the 

60
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:14,164
outcome,
then maybe we should just start 

61
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:18,940
questioning how it's it.
And the bottom line is that a nick woody

62
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:19,774
and life expectancy or the ultimate 
causes of crime and the results of 

63
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:24,124
crime,
to me that's true that you could bind 

64
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:28,690
together in a feedback loop,
but it got some moves to make now.

65
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:31,690
So I'll be back soon.
Just don't ask me what I'm about to do,

66
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,160
right.
Because I can't see,

67
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:33,994
so what's left the on tour effect,
but you're my death and my goal is to 

68
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:38,500
stay alive.
Survival of the fee.

69
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,300
Only the strong survive.
That's right.

70
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,160
We live in this till the day that we 
die.

71
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,363
It's the Bible.

72
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,433
Only the strong survive been this till 
the tea that we die survivals are the 

73
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:50,440
fee only the strong survive.
That's right.

74
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,300
We live in this till the tape that we 
die.

75
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,493
It's the Bible of the fee.
Only the strong survive this till the 

76
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:58,780
day that we die.
Survival of the fee.

77
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,580
Only the strong survive.
That's right.

78
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,850
We live in this till the tea that we dad
survival over the fit.

79
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,980
Only the strong.
Only the strong.

80
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,500
Strong,
strong.

81
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:09,963
Yeah.
Sending this out on the evolutionary 

82
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:15,430
psychologists,
Daly and Wilson.

83

Steven pinker.
Robert Reich.

84
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,930
Yeah.
David Sloan.

85

Wilson.
Yeah,

86
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,560
that's right.
Gathered the evidence.

87
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,053
Make it real.
Make it real human mentality and you 

88
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:29,850
represent,
yes.

89
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,693
Human Nature.
Human Nature to the core mine and you 

90
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:35,554
get Joe's don't question my actions 
unless you're ready to make a little 

91
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:44,791
addition and before I make a subtraction
up and traction.

92
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,010
That's right.
Love scrapping

93
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,683
please.

94
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,570
I'm here talking today with Dr. Martin 
Daly.

95
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,123
Doctor daily is a professor of 
psychology at mcmaster university in 

96
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:27,424
Hamilton,
Ontario and author of many influential 

97
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:30,604
papers on evolutionary psychology.
His current research topics include an 

98
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:38,140
evolutionary perspective on risk taking 
and interpersonal violence,

99
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,540
especially male male conflict

100
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,553
and fast.
He and his wife that late Margo Wilson 

101
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,420
where the former editors in chief of the
journal evolution and human behavior and

102
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:53,690
former presidents of the human behavior 
and evolution society.

103
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,303
He was named a fellow of the Royal 
Society Canada in 1998 daily is one of 

104
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:01,004
the main researchers of the Cinderella 
effect and has been interviewed many 

105
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:04,874
times in the press about it.
So I'm very pleased to be talking with 

106
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:12,410
doctor daily this morning.
It seems to me that he's one of Canada's

107
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,273
most outstanding psychologists and 
perhaps you could say that about 

108
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,143
psychologists in the world.
And he's done some incredibly 

109
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:24,731
interesting research on the relationship
between inequality and male violence and

110
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,320
inequality and other topics too.
So welcome Dr Daily.

111
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,680
Thank you Jordan.
It's nice to be talking to you.

112
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,933
Well,
I'm looking forward to our conversation 

113
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:37,790
a lot.
So you just wrote a book,

114
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:41,240
which I'm going to show people called 
killing the competition

115
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,900
and uh,
I just read it.

116
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,973
It was very interesting.
So I thought maybe I could get you to 

117
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:50,970
start by talking a little bit about the 
book and,

118
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,570
and also how you tell us,
tell us the story that would be the,

119
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,940
the good,
a good thing to do.

120
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,873
Well,
the general issue that is addressed in 

121
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,080
the book is the relationship between 
economic and inequality,

122
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:10,081
which is usually indexed as income 
inequality and homicide rates.

123
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:11,523
And it's been known for a long time by 
sociologists that income inequality is 

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,500
the single best predictor they've got of
homicide rates across countries,

125
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,483
across states,
within the u s across cities within the 

126
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:28,981
u s and some other kinds of 
jurisdictional comparisons and there has

127
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:31,024
been controversy about why that is and 
whether any quality itself is truly the 

128
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:38,230
problem or whether it's just a correlate
of something else.

129
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,413
And in this book I tried to make the 
case that no inequality really is the 

130
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:42,694
problem and some of the arguments that 
have been events for suggesting that 

131
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,203
Amir correlate of violence rather than 
in some way causal to violence are 

132
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:50,614
wrong.
Can you tell us a little bit about how 

133
00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:56,530
you calculate inequality and what the 
measure is?

134
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,690
Yeah,
income inequality.

135
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,680
There's a number of different measures 
that are used by economists and I'm just

136
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:05,260
borrowing the dominant ones from 
economists.

137
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,010
The number one one is something called 
the Gini Index Gin.

138
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:11,590
I,
I used to assume that that was some kind

139
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:12,424
of a acronym,
but actually it was the name of an 

140
00:08:13,991 --> 00:08:18,991
Italian economist and it's a measured 
that is rages from zero to one.

141
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,423
It would be zero if everybody had 
exactly the same income or exactly the 

142
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:26,284
same wealth if you're doing wealth 
inequality and it would approach one as 

143
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,653
income or wealth was concentrated more 
and more in the hands of few and then a 

144
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:36,424
single individual and in principle would
go to one in the extreme if all wealth 

145
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:43,660
were held by Bill Gates and done in the 
rest of us had anything.

146
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,043
Now you analyze the,
the judy coefficient to have different 

147
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,730
levels of of jurisdiction.
Hey,

148
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:52,564
so I noticed in your work that you've 
looked at countries and states within 

149
00:08:57,331 --> 00:08:58,164
countries and I think that's 
particularly true in the u s so tell us 

150
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:03,210
a little bit about what you found.

151
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,913
Yeah.
Well with within the U S and again this 

152
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:08,164
has been done by sociologists for some 
time within the u s and cross 

153
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:13,040
nationally.
Um,

154
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,810
the Gini Coefficient is a very good 
predictor of homicide.

155
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:21,190
The correlation tends to be on the order
of 0.7 in many studies,

156
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,053
which means that the variants in either 
measure 50% of it could be a count of 

157
00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:27,724
four by no variability.
And the other measure when I'm saying 

158
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:32,050
between homicide and income and 
equality,

159
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:36,150
and actually it even works on a 
neighborhood level.

160
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,013
My late wife Margaux and I publish some 
analyses in Chicago that showed they 

161
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:42,580
didn't cut any quality,
wasn't very strong predictor of homicide

162
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:45,190
rates across neighborhoods within 
Chicago.

163
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,650
Tell us a little bit about

164
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,733
you did in Chicago cause that that 
research is extremely interesting and 

165
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,220
also when you did it.

166
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,660
Um,
let's see.

167
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:54,494
We did our work in Chicago in the early 
nineties and at that time Chicago had a 

168
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,980
very high homicide rate,
not the worst in the United States,

169
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:04,814
but one of the worst in the United 
States and in fact have more homicides 

170
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:08,870
every year.
And then the whole of Canada,

171
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,340
which makes it a substantial enough 
phenomenon that you can sort of look for

172
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,050
causal factors or correlates without a 
lot of stochastic noise.

173
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,280
Um,
it,

174
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:20,114
Chicago,
Chicago is divided up into some 77 I 

175
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:25,070
believe,
neighborhoods by,

176
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,863
there's a longstanding tradition of 
urban sociology in Chicago and there's 

177
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:30,494
these sort of well recognized 77 
neighborhoods in any way for these 

178
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,023
neighborhoods.
We were able to amass a variety of 

179
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:40,820
neighborhoods,
specific information including an income

180
00:10:40,821 --> 00:10:44,440
distributions on homicides and so forth.
Uh,

181
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,403
working with the Chicago police who were
collaborators in some of this work and 

182
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,080
Margo,
um,

183
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,513
went to the Illinois Department of 
Health to try and get information on 

184
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:57,883
other death rates and birth rates and 
demographic structure of each of the 

185
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:02,984
neighborhoods.

186
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,190
And she wanted to compute the life 
expectancy because the idea that she had

187
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,383
was the local life expectancy.
Would he affect the extent to which 

188
00:11:11,331 --> 00:11:16,331
people were willing to sort of escalate 
dangerously in competitive situations in

189
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:18,404
competitive.
And that was our construal of what most 

190
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:21,584
homicides in Chicago.
We're about where guys killing each 

191
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:27,050
other when dissed embars,
um,

192
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,033
circumstances in which there is some 
sort of competition and it gets 

193
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:34,130
dangerous and are our basic idea.
They are.

194
00:11:34,131 --> 00:11:38,350
And elsewhere has been that a lot of the
variability in homicide rates,

195
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,690
the most violent,
volatile component of homicide rates has

196
00:11:41,691 --> 00:11:44,150
to do with this male male competition.
And where,

197
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,073
where I'm,
when does it get dangerous and where or 

198
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:51,441
when does it sort of dampen down.
And for Chicago Anyway,

199
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,820
the Illinois Department of Health had 
never,

200
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:59,170
nobody had ever computed neighborhoods 
specific life expectancy,

201
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,810
but the data were available to do it,
age specific [inaudible] and sell.

202
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,653
I was available to do it.
And so we computed a significant life 

203
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:10,840
expectancies,
income equality and many other variables

204
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:11,674
that uh,
criminologists have considered relevant 

205
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:18,130
in past studies,
racial heterogeneity and blah,

206
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:18,964
blah,
blah and tried to see what were your 

207
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:21,904
best predictor.
So homicide and in that particular 

208
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:25,720
study,
everywhere else we've worked,

209
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:26,554
we've mostly found incoming equality 
would be number one in that particular 

210
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:30,934
study,
incoming equality was a very good 

211
00:12:32,531 --> 00:12:33,364
predictor,
but the best predictor was male life 

212
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:39,760
expectancy at age,
at birth or an age 15.

213
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,940
And in order to compute,
like of course you say homicide rates,

214
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,163
homicide reduces male life expectancy.
So you have to remove homicides 

215
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:52,060
statistically as a cause of death and 
say life expectancy net of the impact of

216
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:52,894
homicide,
that was our best predictor of homicide 

217
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:55,624
rates.
And life expectancy is very variable in 

218
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:00,460
the city of Chicago.
And I assume that other US cities,

219
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,563
I mean the worst neighborhoods,
male life expectancy at birth was down 

220
00:13:04,271 --> 00:13:07,540
in the 50s as bad as in the worst 
countries in the world,

221
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,733
in the best neighborhoods,
male life expectancy was up in the I 

222
00:13:11,511 --> 00:13:14,920
think was over 80 or in the high 
seventies in any case,

223
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,983
um,
corresponding to what you might expect 

224
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:21,010
in Scandinavia are the places but the 
best life expectancy in the world.

225
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:21,843
So it was a huge range.
That was our best predictor than if you 

226
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:26,620
try and do a multivariate analysis where
you look for,

227
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:27,454
well,
what else predicts some the residual 

228
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,440
variability and there wasn't much 
research tool variability.

229
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:36,250
The second best indeed,
the only secondary predictor that seemed

230
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:37,084
to be statistically significant was 
income inequality across the 

231
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:40,780
neighborhoods.
That was,

232
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,960
that was the thrust of our,
our study in Chicago.

233
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:48,040
And I got lots to see more work on life 
expectancy as a predictor of violence,

234
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,870
um,
of a university.

235
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,470
Take them all right.
Y'All crib it all.

236
00:13:51,471 --> 00:13:52,304
And just mark,
we've tried to do the same thing in 

237
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,830
Montreal,
but he felt that a Montreal,

238
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,113
the difference in life expectancy for 
men between the worst and the best 

239
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:03,880
neighborhoods was only six years,
whereas Chicago,

240
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:05,800
it was 24 years,
I think.

241
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,500
So what do you,
what do you think accounted for the vast

242
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:11,460
difference in life expectancy between 
Chicago and Montreal?

243
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,580
Was life expectancy itself associated 
with income inequality?

244
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,231
Well,
yes.

245
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,064
I mean that's part of the problem of 
course in all this kind of research 

246
00:14:20,241 --> 00:14:22,000
here,
it's not experimental research.

247
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:22,834
You don't control independent variables 
and everything of potential interest is 

248
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:27,670
correlated with everything else.
So,

249
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,193
you know,
income inequality alone accounts for 

250
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:34,480
more than half the variance in homicide 
rates across Chicago neighborhoods.

251
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,780
So does life expectancy alone.
Um,

252
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,930
so does percent below the poverty line 
alone.

253
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,190
Um,
you know,

254
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,380
like these things are all correlated 
with each other.

255
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:48,160
And so try to tease apart what's most 
important is tricky.

256
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,383
So the low life expectancy,
Chicago neighborhoods is not due to 

257
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:54,170
violence.
A student,

258
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,093
it's,
it's too overwhelming lead to 

259
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,890
differential disease.
Um,

260
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,580
in Chicago,
you know,

261
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,200
privatization of medicine in the U s was
so extremely tight.

262
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,113
We were doing this research.
Emergency rooms in the worst 

263
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:11,270
neighborhoods in Chicago had closed down
because they got bankrupt.

264
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,353
Um,
they didn't have enough money to remain 

265
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:17,960
open and therefore if you got stabbed or
shot in a bad neighborhood in Chicago,

266
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:18,794
you had to be transported somewhere else
to try and keep you alive because there 

267
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:23,540
was,
you know,

268
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:27,500
the hospitals and shut their emergency 
rooms or had shut down completely.

269
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,860
So there's all sorts of factors that 
contribute to a,

270
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,620
to differential death rates.
But you know,

271
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:36,370
kids in the worst neighborhood are 
exposed to high levels of wed.

272
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,143
There's some evidence that lead exposure
and childhoods is a big predictor of 

273
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,480
variability of life expectancy.
Um,

274
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,553
all kinds of internal diseases.
They were more susceptible to the 

275
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:51,500
effects of bad nutrition.
They were more susceptible to.

276
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:56,590
So if you divide causes of death and 
just so called external causes,

277
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:58,424
which basically means homicides,
suicides and accidents and internal 

278
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:02,804
causes,
which is more or less synonymous with 

279
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,640
what we ordinarily think of as disease 
internal causes,

280
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:08,474
we're still the biggest source of 
differential mortality across 

281
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,053
neighborhoods.

282
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,653
So you could make by the sounds of it,
you could make a reasonable case that 

283
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:20,350
the same social safety net in Canada is 
flattening out the bottom of the,

284
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,710
of the income distribution,
especially the provision of healthcare.

285
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,060
And you know,
I also

286
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,380
was informed a while back,
uh,

287
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,853
that the rate of entrepreneurship in 
Canada is actually higher than in than 

288
00:16:33,071 --> 00:16:33,904
in the u s and part of the reason for 
that is that because healthcare is 

289
00:16:36,491 --> 00:16:37,324
provided,
people can take a risk of walking away 

290
00:16:39,251 --> 00:16:42,250
from their jobs without putting their 
family completely at risk.

291
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,084
And so one of the perverse effects of 
socialized medicine is that it elevates 

292
00:16:46,391 --> 00:16:49,780
the rates of entrepreneurship.
So I also wanted to mention,

293
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,350
you know,
your,

294
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,240
your work was absolutely striking to me 
because of the effect sizes.

295
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:58,010
Now for people who don't know about,
uh,

296
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,373
how to compare effects sizes,
I should point out that you never see a 

297
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:06,820
correlation of 0.7 between any two 
variables in the social sciences.

298
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,773
So there's a guy named Hamp Hale who did
an empirical analysis of effect size 

299
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,200
comparisons,
uh,

300
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,950
about four or five years ago.
Might be longer than that now.

301
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,730
And he concluded that 95% of social 
science studies had a effect size of 0.5

302
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,624
or less.
And so to see a correlation of 0.7 is 

303
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:28,630
absolutely overwhelming when you also 
take into account that measurement error

304
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:32,320
is decreasing the potency of the 
relationship to some degree.

305
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,070
So that's,

306
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,100
and when you take into account that,
uh,

307
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,053
that those,
that 0.5 represents studies that were 

308
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:40,950
published because they got something.

309
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,410
Yes,
exactly.

310
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,370
Exactly.
So,

311
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,443
so 0.7 it's absolutely overwhelming.
I've never seen effect sizes that big 

312
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:51,810
between two variables of interest in any
other domain that I can recall.

313
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,240
And then the other thing that's worth 
pointing out,

314
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,130
and we can talk about this a little bit 
too,

315
00:17:56,131 --> 00:17:59,700
is the other thing that's so radical 
about your research is that it,

316
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,290
and,
and this,

317
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,153
this what emerges out of the,
out of the manner in which the Gini 

318
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,143
Coefficient is,
is calculated because it's only a 

319
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:10,440
measure of relative poverty.
Um,

320
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,680
and it's the predictor.
You,

321
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,533
you also generate it data indicating 
that places where everyone was 

322
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:21,960
relatively poor or say relatively 
working class like North Dakota and some

323
00:18:21,961 --> 00:18:22,794
of the Canadian provinces had very low 
homicide rates and also places where 

324
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:28,740
everyone was rich.
Right?

325
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:29,574
So to rate reiterate,
what you're seeing is that what's 

326
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:35,530
driving male homicide is the existence.
And for,

327
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,050
you know,
correct me if I'm wrong,

328
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:37,884
the existence of a steep economic 
dominance hierarchy that makes it 

329
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:42,744
difficult for the young men to obtain 
status through what you might describe 

330
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:49,110
as conventional and socially productive 
means.

331
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:53,340
And so instead they turned to violence 
as a means of establishing status.

332
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,174
And most of that's within race and 
between young men jockeying for 

333
00:18:57,661 --> 00:18:59,580
position.
Is that all correct?

334
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,341
Yeah,
I,

335
00:19:00,341 --> 00:19:02,880
I think that's a pretty fair 
characterization.

336
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,050
Um,
uh,

337
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,820
it's,
it's worth stressing.

338
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:06,654
Yes.
That income inequality is in principle 

339
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:09,294
and in practice dissociable from just 
averaging cub or 4% below the poverty 

340
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:17,700
line or other measures of cell called 
absolute a deprivation,

341
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,200
they're often correlated,
you know,

342
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,280
income inequality across a certain set 
of jurisdictions,

343
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:26,050
maybe fairly strongly correlated with,
um,

344
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,320
the percent below the poverty line.
For example.

345
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:31,830
It'd be surprising if it was not,
you should correlated,

346
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,910
but,
uh,

347
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,710
but they're not necessarily as you said.

348
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,210
Yeah.
So you demonstrate it or you were one of

349
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:39,040
the first people to demonstrate where 
you,

350
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:39,874
the first,
in fact maybe that it wasn't poverty 

351
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:42,634
that was causing this kind of crime.
It was relative poverty and that that 

352
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:47,320
changes the interpretation of the 
situation.

353
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:48,550
Absolutely.
Dramatically.

354
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:49,384
So tell us a little bit about why you 
think that males are competing in this 

355
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,350
deadly manner.
What's driving that behavior?

356
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,530
Well,
it's very interesting,

357
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,364
I think.
I think men are sensitive to or 

358
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,173
interested in relative position status 
of maintaining face in competitive 

359
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,460
billions.
And in a sense,

360
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,840
all videos are a bit competitive.
Um,

361
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,933
and the willingness to use bio,
it's partly s can be thought of as kind 

362
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:25,651
of a disdain for the future or I walked 
by now,

363
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,693
um,
I'm willing to do something that 

364
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:28,863
threatens by wife,
like escalate and competition are not 

365
00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:32,404
backed out or not walk away from an 
insult because I'm thinking very short 

366
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:43,471
term the rewards for,
for being passive.

367
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,730
You know,
if you're,

368
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,000
if you're a nice of Prosperous 
University,

369
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:52,870
student of age 20,
you have good life prospects,

370
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,010
your chances for eventually becoming a 
well paid,

371
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,013
uh,
maybe people will laugh at this are 

372
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,543
still reasonably good.
Your chances for eventually burying are 

373
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:06,580
still reasonably good if you're the same
age guide to guy,

374
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,571
um,
in,

375
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:08,404
uh,
urban ghetto with a 48% of the 

376
00:21:11,231 --> 00:21:11,890
appointment,
right?

377
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,723
Or something like that,
that you have very much more Ed ed with 

378
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,870
uncertainty about the stability of 
whatever income you do get with,

379
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:20,704
with,
um,

380
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,633
the future of node,
then you're more willing to take a risk 

381
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:26,194
now in the pursuit of status now and the
produce suit of sexual opportunity now 

382
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:35,530
in the pursuit of monetary rewards,
illegal or illicit now.

383
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:36,723
And also the maintenance of face,
like social reputation is the one 

384
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,063
resource you've got.
If you've got other resources you could 

385
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:50,281
walk away from threats or or
disrespect,

386
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,430
um,
add and reap your rewards later.

387
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,533
If social status is all you've got,
then it becomes an important thing to 

388
00:21:58,721 --> 00:21:59,554
defend.

389
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,123
So I read some research a while back.
It looked at the relationship between 

390
00:22:04,701 --> 00:22:05,534
socioeconomic status among men and 
number of sexual partners and also 

391
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,580
socioeconomic status among women,
a number of sexual partners.

392
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:17,080
And that's another domain where you see 
these kinds of whopping correlations.

393
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:17,914
So the correlation between socioeconomic
status for men and number of available 

394
00:22:22,431 --> 00:22:27,431
sexual partners is about 0.6 or 0.7.
Whereas for women it's negative 0.12 and

395
00:22:29,001 --> 00:22:29,834
so do you think,
so do you think that it's reasonable to 

396
00:22:33,381 --> 00:22:34,214
assume that either at the phylogenetic 
level level or the on a genetic level 

397
00:22:37,971 --> 00:22:38,804
leave either evolutionarily speaking or 
even as a consequence of rational 

398
00:22:41,571 --> 00:22:45,290
calculation that part of the reason that
men are perhaps the main reason that men

399
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,483
are engaging in these status 
competitions is because of female hyper 

400
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,440
gummy?
Is that a reasonable,

401
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,330
is that a reasonable hypothesis?

402
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,940
Hypercarbia and as you say,
set up simple access.

403
00:22:56,941 --> 00:22:58,020
I mean there,
there is

404
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,353
there,
the association that you mentioned is 

405
00:23:02,821 --> 00:23:03,654
presumably a very longstanding one.
That is to say that bed ups with status 

406
00:23:06,961 --> 00:23:11,700
et resources have had access to partners
for sure.

407
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,720
And probably multiple partners 
simultaneously or serially.

408
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,893
Um,
to a degree that bed of lower status 

409
00:23:19,051 --> 00:23:19,884
have dot.
There's high variates it eventual 

410
00:23:21,571 --> 00:23:26,220
reproduction among males in mammals 
generally.

411
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,083
And although the situation is less 
extreme and people that have been the 

412
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:32,160
other battles,
the same is true for people.

413
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:32,994
I mean what you say,
they have high variates compared to 

414
00:23:35,521 --> 00:23:36,061
what?
Well,

415
00:23:36,061 --> 00:23:38,310
high variates compared to women for 
example,

416
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,550
of the variability and eventual 
reproductive success as well.

417
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:45,730
Where for women than for men or husband.
Now you say sexual to it,

418
00:23:45,731 --> 00:23:46,564
but I think that's exactly the right 
level to be working out got in 

419
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:48,974
contemporary societies.
But the reason why that matters is 

420
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:54,104
because ancestrally that translated into
differential reproduction in a moderate 

421
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:01,400
environment of which you don't cut.
Perceptive technology is available,

422
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,810
especially to women than,
uh,

423
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,380
that that correlation may be broken 
down.

424
00:24:06,381 --> 00:24:11,270
But the motives to seek sexual 
opportunity,

425
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,980
um,
remain relevant.

426
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,240
So one of the things that I wanted to 
talk to you about too,

427
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:18,380
is to,
like you,

428
00:24:18,381 --> 00:24:19,214
you,
you made a comment in your book about 

429
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:21,224
Adrian Rates and Adrian rains has 
written a book recently about the 

430
00:24:24,441 --> 00:24:25,274
biological predictors of criminality.
And you make a strong case that in some 

431
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:32,070
sense the,
the,

432
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,993
the turning to violence that's 
characteristic of men in uncertain 

433
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:40,160
situations is rational because it 
drives,

434
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,053
it actually legitimately drive status 
increase and that produces a variety of 

435
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:45,823
positive effects.
So in some sense it's a rational 

436
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:51,590
response to a radically uncertain 
environment where competition is high.

437
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:56,180
Now reigns would say no biological type 
researchers they look at,

438
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,163
they look more at the individual level 
and conclude that it's individuals who 

439
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,640
have various forms of prefrontal damage 
or,

440
00:25:02,641 --> 00:25:03,474
or characterological issues associated 
with antisocial personality disorder 

441
00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:11,660
that are more likely to engage in 
violent acts.

442
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,490
And you can track that.
I mean,

443
00:25:13,491 --> 00:25:15,770
Rashard Trombley has done some of this 
work in Quebec.

444
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,233
You can track the emergence of 
aggression at an individual level all 

445
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:20,984
the way back to children at two years of
age because it turns out that children 

446
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,570
who are two are the most violent 
children,

447
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,003
particularly the boys,
but mostly a subset of boys who who 

448
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:35,210
can't fight,
hit and bite and steel at two,

449
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,600
most of whom are socialized by the age 
of four,

450
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,440
but a subset of whom are not socialized 
and then they become,

451
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,860
they're more likely to become the 
lifetime offenders.

452
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,003
And,
and so what I'm wondering is maybe you 

453
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:52,220
can reconcile the difference between the
two research streams like this.

454
00:25:52,221 --> 00:25:53,054
Imagine that as the economic gradient 
increases and the dominance hierarchy 

455
00:25:56,991 --> 00:26:01,520
becomes steeper and steeper,
the men who are prone to be violent,

456
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,943
I'm like,
it's the disagreeable men that start to 

457
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:06,404
be violet first,
maybe ones that have an impulse control 

458
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:11,330
problem or that are character a 
logically like,

459
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,193
like the violent two year olds that are 
character logically predisposed to be 

460
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:15,524
violent.
It seems to me that those would be the 

461
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:17,690
ones that,
you know,

462
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:22,100
as the pressure increases,
those men who are more prone to violence

463
00:26:22,101 --> 00:26:25,880
for other reasons are going to be the 
people who react with violence first.

464
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:28,190
You think that's a reasonable 
hypothesis?

465
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,413
Yeah,
I think that's a very reasonable 

466
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:31,030
hypothesis.
I mean,

467
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,020
my objection to atria raids book was 
that I think he vast,

468
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:36,930
you know,
he's,

469
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,650
there's definitely evidence that betty 
kinds of,

470
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,583
uh,
violet criminal offenders have got 

471
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:46,590
something wrong with their braids.
Eight Rehab Ray bloods to extrapolate to

472
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:49,010
the conclusion that violent criminals I 
did.

473
00:26:49,011 --> 00:26:49,844
Deep criminals in general have got 
something broken about their braids and 

474
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:56,700
it's like criminality is pathological.
Well,

475
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,653
criminality is not pathological.
People steal for cost benefit related 

476
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:05,170
reasons.
Um,

477
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,293
the crime is a,
if you like God help us social 

478
00:27:12,181 --> 00:27:14,360
construction in the sense that,
um,

479
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:19,320
certain behaviors are criminalized by a 
larger social group.

480
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,183
It ordered to the turn up because self 
interested individuals but otherwise 

481
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:24,661
pursued them.
You know,

482
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:27,930
how do you make people stop exploiting 
others,

483
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:28,764
stealing from others
by criminalizing those activities and 

484
00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:33,664
imposing penalties.
And you know there's a rational choice 

485
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,343
of stream of theorizing within 
criminology that that other people like 

486
00:27:41,681 --> 00:27:43,650
Adrian Ray just dismiss out of head.
No,

487
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:46,740
no.
Criminal offenses are pathological.

488
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:50,430
Yeah and I think that's silly.
Well it seems unnecessary

489
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:54,710
because it is also difficult to make a 
marriage between the two issues.

490
00:27:54,711 --> 00:27:55,544
Like one of the best predictors,
you know I do research on individual 

491
00:27:58,311 --> 00:27:59,144
differences in personality and the best 
personality predictor of incarceration 

492
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:03,524
is low agreeableness.
That's one of the dimensions on which 

493
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:10,751
men and women differ the most.
And so as you become more disagreeable,

494
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,790
you become more self oriented I would 
say.

495
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:14,624
And that can push past the point where 
you're so self interested that you're 

496
00:28:17,931 --> 00:28:18,764
willing to prey on others.
And so those are the guys that as well 

497
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:25,400
as the guys who lack impulse control,
those are the guys,

498
00:28:25,401 --> 00:28:26,234
the first guys to turn to violence,
let's say when the socioeconomic 

499
00:28:28,911 --> 00:28:29,744
conditions become sufficiently unstable 
so that a conscientious approach is not 

500
00:28:34,551 --> 00:28:35,384
tenable.

501
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,010
Yeah,
that's at the marriage between that kind

502
00:28:38,011 --> 00:28:38,844
of thing.
Keg Ed ed thinking about irrelevant so 

503
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:45,750
that any quality is that there's guys at
the top who are white,

504
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,613
the violet people you described,
there's people doing very well who are 

505
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:50,994
very happy to explain to others,
but the costs of individual bio it 

506
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:55,524
action are high enough and the 
opportunities to exploit other people 

507
00:28:58,231 --> 00:29:01,010
through sight.
And she'll be just through your lawyers,

508
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,063
um,
through whatever tactics are available 

509
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:06,180
to,
you know,

510
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,193
well he'll bullies are,
are safe enough that they opt to behave 

511
00:29:11,611 --> 00:29:12,444
with those directions,

512
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,053
right?
Because they've gone to their longterm 

513
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,533
future is relatively stable.
And so that longterm planning and 

514
00:29:19,721 --> 00:29:23,350
regulation of behavior actually play an 
important economic role.

515
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:24,983
Add,
add,

516
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:25,973
you know,
and then in the case of somebody like 

517
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,560
Donald Trump,
I mean,

518
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:29,394
he looks like somebody who's suffering a
little bit of an impulse control 

519
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:34,080
problem,
especially sort of during the night when

520
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:37,890
he wakes up and does his twitter account
is too close at head.

521
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,053
But he's,
he's rich enough to bully people at 

522
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,610
other ways that actually heads on 
violence.

523
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,040
Although come to think of it,
uh,

524
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,293
the famous remark that he made during 
the campaign about women suggests 

525
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:54,440
perhaps that,
you know,

526
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,500
it depends on your definition of heads 
on violence,

527
00:29:56,501 --> 00:29:57,700
I guess that qualifies.

528
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,953
Okay.
So,

529
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,133
um,
there's a very large body of research 

530
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:05,320
that indicates that alcohol is a major 
contributor to criminality too,

531
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:07,720
especially with regards to men.
Um,

532
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,033
and so both 50% of people who were 
murdered have a decent blood alcohol 

533
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:13,474
level and about 50% of murders.
And I think that's partly that stat is 

534
00:30:17,171 --> 00:30:18,004
equal equalizes,
I think because much violence among men 

535
00:30:21,101 --> 00:30:21,934
is exactly the sort that you described 
where it's a status dispute and it's 

536
00:30:24,851 --> 00:30:27,370
more or less a toss up who's going to 
come out as a winner.

537
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:28,563
But then I guess what's happening with 
alcohol perhaps is that because it's a 

538
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:36,541
disinhibitor because it reduces anxiety 
and anxiety is one of the suppressors of

539
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:40,270
aggressive behavior that men who are 
already on the edge,

540
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:41,104
let's say,
because of the unstable environment and 

541
00:30:42,461 --> 00:30:43,294
the steep dominance arc,
you're also more likely lose control 

542
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,533
when they're drinking.

543
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:47,703
And maybe that's also fuel.
This is something to that I'm curious 

544
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:50,560
about.
I mean,

545
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,930
you can think about it as a rational 
calculation,

546
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:55,810
but,
but I'm also curious about the degree to

547
00:30:55,811 --> 00:30:58,900
which it's fueled by emergent negative 
emotions.

548
00:30:58,901 --> 00:30:59,734
So it's easy for people who are in a 
steep dominance hierarchies to regard 

549
00:31:05,471 --> 00:31:06,304
this system as unfair and to become 
resentful and angry about it as perhaps 

550
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:10,984
they should be.
I'm not suggesting that that's 

551
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:13,114
necessarily an irrational response,
but it seems that if the anger is 

552
00:31:17,531 --> 00:31:18,364
simmering underneath the surface,
that it's waiting in some sense for an 

553
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:26,480
opportunity to break free and alcohol in
a bar or at home perhaps provides that,

554
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,910
that that route.

555
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,180
What you say makes evidence says to be,
I made a boat,

556
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,393
it's probably worth injecting a bit of a
caution about the word rationality 

557
00:31:36,851 --> 00:31:38,470
generally well,
but talks about,

558
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,900
um,
rationality and cry,

559
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:43,450
but perhaps especially a confrontational
violence.

560
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,913
The point is not that the person has 
making good and carefully weigh 

561
00:31:48,081 --> 00:31:49,600
decisions.
I mean,

562
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:50,434
I think,
you know,

563
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,430
emotions are the handmaid of what I 
would call ecological rationality.

564
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,443
They,
they help you know how you should feel 

565
00:31:57,911 --> 00:32:00,130
about certain things and how you should 
react to them.

566
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:05,460
And the rationality clay as more on clay
above this person gets riled up,

567
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,030
resents x ad there.
Eddie should it.

568
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:13,030
There's good reason to get routed up at 
breeze at x.

569
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:18,031
But the fact that alcohol,
perhaps this inhibits so that you know,

570
00:32:19,151 --> 00:32:19,984
the,
the truly rational ballots between 

571
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,080
inhibitory and aggressive emotions is 
altered.

572
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:30,280
The idea that ration that alcohol 
interferes with,

573
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,880
with cognitive process,
which is the point that people are start

574
00:32:33,881 --> 00:32:35,980
making stupid decisions when they're 
drunk,

575
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,113
uh,
decide to get behind the wheel or 

576
00:32:38,231 --> 00:32:39,064
whatever.
I think this plays very heavily yet to 

577
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:41,174
the reason why.
So Betty Hobbyist sides tend to happen 

578
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,103
in contexts like two drunks is 
assaulting each other and stuff or you 

579
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:49,883
know,
people who are somewhat under the 

580
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:54,500
influence of alcohol and insulting each 
other rather than uh,

581
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,151
you know,
with you,

582
00:32:56,151 --> 00:32:56,984
if you have more,
if you have more bed til wherewithal at 

583
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:01,064
the moment,
you probably have better capacities to 

584
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:07,340
confuse date to diffuse dangerous 
situations through,

585
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,750
um,
you know,

586
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:14,900
ways that don't tail losing face by,
by being articulate.

587
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,380
Great.
Exactly.

588
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,713
That's right.
You have other tools at your disposal 

589
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:23,450
rather than immediate recourse to your 
fists.

590
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:24,710
Thank you.
Yes.

591
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,480
So if I remember correctly,
two and your Chicago Studies,

592
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:33,740
this is one of the things that I found 
particularly fascinating was you tracked

593
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:34,574
the consequences of killing someone in 
Chicago and the consequences were 

594
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:40,430
something of the following sort.
Well,

595
00:33:40,431 --> 00:33:41,264
first of all,
you are likely to be charged with 

596
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:43,064
something like second degree murder.
It would be difficult for the police to 

597
00:33:46,281 --> 00:33:49,220
find people to testify against you.
And if they did,

598
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:54,080
generally what they would say is that it
was a two way altercation.

599
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,890
And so in many cases you could plead 
self defense.

600
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,783
Often it didn't go before a jury because
the perpetrator plea bargain to down to 

601
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:06,440
manslaughter.
The sentence was something on the,

602
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,393
on the order of a couple of years and 
people were generally out of prison in 

603
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:11,444
18 months with a substantial boost in 
their social capital because now they 

604
00:34:14,841 --> 00:34:18,590
were like dangerous sons of bitches not 
to be messed with.

605
00:34:18,591 --> 00:34:19,424
And that was quite clear and also 
perhaps also improved so to speak by 

606
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:25,940
their soldier and in prison is that is 
if I got that right,

607
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,550
except for what detail?
Well,

608
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,680
actually it,
our Chicago studies,

609
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,543
we didn't have as good followup 
information is what you're talking 

610
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:34,400
about.
This,

611
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,233
this was a early,
a piece of research in the city of 

612
00:34:36,981 --> 00:34:40,310
Detroit that uh,
that led to most of those findings.

613
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,630
But uh,
but yeah,

614
00:34:41,631 --> 00:34:43,000
exactly.
Um,

615
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,320
hardly,
it's interesting.

616
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,143
We had a,
we had a single year sample of cases of 

617
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:54,161
Detroit and there were I think 590 
homicide to Detroit that one year night,

618
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:58,060
he'd 72 at which time Detroit did have 
the highest homicide rate.

619
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,870
The U s s a large majority of these are 
bail bail dispute.

620
00:35:02,871 --> 00:35:03,704
So some sort of status disputes usually,
but sometimes robberies and just as you 

621
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:10,750
said,
um,

622
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,170
witnesses are unlikely to come forward 
and have the prosecutors are stretched.

623
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:16,004
They don't have,
they don't have the resources that they 

624
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:21,930
would need to pursue every case.
And so they,

625
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,920
many cases were dismissed.

626
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,753
I'd be not even prosecuted,
never buy play bark and something like 

627
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:28,664
approximately half of all male male 
macho dispute homicides in Detroit that 

628
00:35:32,061 --> 00:35:34,760
were solved.
We're not prosecuted.

629
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:39,150
And the expectation that there was a 
self defense argument that bites,

630
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:39,951
you know,
with,

631
00:35:39,951 --> 00:35:42,930
with the jury that of the half that were
prosecuted,

632
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,090
almost all of them,
yeah,

633
00:35:45,091 --> 00:35:48,810
we're plea bargained down to bad 
slaughter and the majority of them got a

634
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:49,740
conviction,
right.

635
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:52,920
It's three years,
50% of the time off for good behavior.

636
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:53,754
If you've behaved nicely,
you go to Jackson State Prison in 

637
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:57,080
Michigan,
uh,

638
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,760
18 months later you're back out on the 
streets of Detroit.

639
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,400
And Margo in particular was very 
addressed.

640
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,263
The question of whether killing in these
contexts might either to actually 

641
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,280
ultimately pay off.
For guys,

642
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:13,440
I tend to,
the view that actually killing is that,

643
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,780
oh,
he's overstepping the bounds of utility,

644
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:16,830
um,
that,

645
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:21,780
that,
that deadly threats are very selfish,

646
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:24,150
rested and ineffectual,
but up again.

647
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:27,090
But that actually following through onto
this may be the,

648
00:36:27,091 --> 00:36:27,924
you know,
the,

649
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,793
that nod functional tip of the iceberg,
but I honestly don't know that that's 

650
00:36:31,861 --> 00:36:34,920
true of these kinds of cases for them,
for exactly this reason that,

651
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,933
um,
guys get some social capital out of 

652
00:36:37,621 --> 00:36:39,330
having done it.
Well,

653
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:39,900
hypothetically,

654
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,280
will your mom,
the Unimog ammo there,

655
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:45,710
the tribe tribes in,
in South America and South America,

656
00:36:45,711 --> 00:36:47,060
I believe are central,
I think it's south.

657
00:36:47,061 --> 00:36:48,360
South America.
Yeah.

658
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,633
The more war,
like men have a much higher rep 

659
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,830
production rate,
the ones who've killed more.

660
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,611
Now,
I don't know,

661
00:36:55,611 --> 00:36:58,940
obviously it isn't necessarily the case 
that that's directly translatable,

662
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:02,810
but there is some utility in being a 
successful warrior.

663
00:37:02,811 --> 00:37:03,644
It's,
that's actually one of the reasons that 

664
00:37:05,031 --> 00:37:08,000
I think that capitalism,
so to speak,

665
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:13,001
is underappreciated because in a very,
I'm speaking in a very specific sense is

666
00:37:13,371 --> 00:37:14,204
that there are disagreeable and wore 
like men and some of them are very 

667
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:19,963
powerful in many ways,
not only physically but intellectually 

668
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:26,930
in character logically and and with with
great ambition.

669
00:37:26,931 --> 00:37:27,764
And the thing about capitalism is that 
it enables them to wage war in a manner 

670
00:37:31,431 --> 00:37:32,264
that's,
that's not deadly and to become 

671
00:37:34,911 --> 00:37:38,150
successful that way and and to channel 
they're there,

672
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,170
they're in intense competitive energy 
into something that,

673
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,130
well I think often is often for a social
good.

674
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,023
Now it depends on how disagreeable the 
person is and how selfish they are of 

675
00:37:49,611 --> 00:37:50,444
course.
But people like that also tend to get 

676
00:37:51,531 --> 00:37:52,364
punished in their,
in their cooperative interactions with 

677
00:37:54,741 --> 00:37:55,574
other people.

678
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,970
Yeah.
I mean I partly agree,

679
00:37:57,971 --> 00:38:01,930
but I also feel that they offered toward
the social good is a bit hopeful.

680
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:02,764
I bead up to the degree that people are 
successful at a fairly unrestrained 

681
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:08,434
capitalist of competition.
It's usually at the expense of large 

682
00:38:12,161 --> 00:38:12,994
numbers of people at the bottom.
But it depends how unrestrained that 

683
00:38:16,901 --> 00:38:17,734
capitalist competition is.
I was thinking of social good as in 

684
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,960
better than war.
Yeah.

685
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,540
Well better than war for sure.
For sure.

686
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:26,374
And sometimes,
and sometimes the way you succeed is by 

687
00:38:28,451 --> 00:38:32,320
producing goods that actually make 
people's lives better.

688
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:36,130
Have no quarrel with that.
So now I also

689
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:39,400
wanted to ask you in the last couple of 
chapters of your book,

690
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:42,460
you turned to what I would regard as 
more political issues.

691
00:38:42,461 --> 00:38:45,790
And so I,
I w and I am,

692
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:46,743
I'm very interested in inequality 
because [inaudible] recapitulate for a 

693
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,003
minute.
So your work and the work of other 

694
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:55,180
people seems to indicate that as 
inequality increases and dominance,

695
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:56,014
hierarchies get steeper.
Not only do young men get more violent 

696
00:38:58,781 --> 00:38:59,614
and so society becomes less stable,
but there's also detrimental impacts on 

697
00:39:03,101 --> 00:39:05,520
things like population health and,
and,

698
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,610
and,
and,

699
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:07,563
and that was,
that was documented quite nicely in the 

700
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:11,080
spirit level.
And so I'm going to,

701
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,093
uh,
address a couple of criticisms of the 

702
00:39:13,691 --> 00:39:16,180
research and,
and then I want to ask you,

703
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:21,040
I want to have a discussion about your,
you're more prescriptive views,

704
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:22,450
if that's okay.
So,

705
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,433
so the first issue,
someone just emailed me this a while 

706
00:39:25,811 --> 00:39:28,300
back and when I was talking about 
inequality and they said,

707
00:39:28,301 --> 00:39:29,134
well,
what about places like China where the 

708
00:39:31,961 --> 00:39:32,794
rates of inequality are starting to 
skyrocket quite substantially and have 

709
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:36,334
been for,
you know,

710
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,980
several years,
maybe it'd be several decades,

711
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,053
yet the,
the homicide rate doesn't seem to be 

712
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:43,420
budging much.

713
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,880
And so I thought,
well that was interesting.

714
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:48,660
Maybe there's something different about 
East Asian communities,

715
00:39:48,661 --> 00:39:51,070
so they tend to have very low crime 
rates to begin with.

716
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,800
Uh,
like places like Japan for example,

717
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:54,634
have very low crime rates.
And so I'm wondering if what you think 

718
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:57,874
about that,
is that a reasonable criticism and how 

719
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:00,550
would you address it?

720
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,320
Fair enough.
Well,

721
00:40:03,321 --> 00:40:06,260
I don't,
I don't think we could characterize,

722
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:10,310
you know,
orientals as less violent than box.

723
00:40:10,311 --> 00:40:14,960
It had holes or anything like that.
I think history tells us otherwise that,

724
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:15,823
uh,
there's been a lot of severe and 

725
00:40:18,051 --> 00:40:20,780
dangerous violence in Japan,
in history,

726
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,673
and did China in history.
I don't know how good data we have on 

727
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:26,624
Chinese homicide rates,
but what I've seen is that they have 

728
00:40:28,371 --> 00:40:29,204
been going up a bit lately,
but still the point that inequality has 

729
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:33,764
been skyrocketing going to be partly 
there's an interesting question about 

730
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,830
time lags effect.
Some people,

731
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:40,640
you know,
how,

732
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,473
how sued is an increased inequality 
effect going to play out as nasty 

733
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,180
interpersonal behavior.
Um,

734
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:53,960
and you know,
people respond to inequality as a result

735
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,820
of their lifetime experiences.
You know,

736
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:56,654
you were talking about young kids,
I'll read very young children already 

737
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:03,050
being predictable and the extent to 
which they're willing to,

738
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,363
you know,
use violet tactics against other people 

739
00:41:06,321 --> 00:41:07,400
and that,
you know,

740
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,360
Asig three and four year olds could give
you some surprisingly good prediction of

741
00:41:11,361 --> 00:41:12,530
how they'll behave as adults.

742
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:13,843
It's not inconceivable that the effects 
of inequality even are influencing 

743
00:41:17,931 --> 00:41:22,040
people's development prenatally.
And so,

744
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:22,961
you know,
the uterus,

745
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:23,794
right?
Environments that they experience as a 

746
00:41:24,921 --> 00:41:25,754
function of,
of inequitable environments and the 

747
00:41:27,771 --> 00:41:31,040
stresses of fraught social comparisons 
and so on that happened.

748
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:34,130
And those environments could be 
influencing at all life stages.

749
00:41:34,131 --> 00:41:34,964
So I don't think we have any strong 
basis for expecting rapid changing 

750
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:43,250
inequality to be a company to the short 
term by rapid change of violence.

751
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:47,120
Of that said there,
you know,

752
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,013
it's certainly the case that there's 
other things that matter and government 

753
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:54,740
controls are wad.
I think,

754
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,633
I think strong governments that 
monopolize the legitimate use of 

755
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:03,560
violence can keep a lit of violence for 
a long time.

756
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,730
Um,
I,

757
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:05,953
you know,
I,

758
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:10,030
I would question whether they can keep 
it played on it indefinitely,

759
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,380
but they could keep a lid on it for a 
long time if you,

760
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:18,970
if you execute all
charged birders.

761
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:20,913
Um,
I presumed that that would keep the 

762
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:23,953
incidents and birder doubt and not only 
because those people could be 

763
00:42:26,571 --> 00:42:27,410
recidivists.

764
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:28,501
Great.
So,

765
00:42:28,501 --> 00:42:31,650
so there's an element of potentially of 
authoritarian control.

766
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,780
Yeah.
And then the other gentleman did,

767
00:42:33,781 --> 00:42:34,614
I think is,
is particularly interesting is the time 

768
00:42:36,961 --> 00:42:37,980
lag argument.
I mean,

769
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:43,450
you don't know over what period of time 
precisely inequality has it's pernicious

770
00:42:43,591 --> 00:42:47,490
effects and maybe it's not even the span
of one lifetime.

771
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,640
It,
I do.

772
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:53,370
Do you have any data on that that that 
would help help answer the question?

773
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:54,700
Well,
I did.

774
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,533
I did make reference in my book killing 
the competition to one sociological 

775
00:43:01,271 --> 00:43:03,490
study that was looking at effects of 
inequality.

776
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:04,403
Ud mortality generally at the notion 
that inequality affects mortality 

777
00:43:08,201 --> 00:43:10,870
generally is mediated by what you were 
talking about,

778
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:12,640
about health effects.
The idea that,

779
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:13,991
uh,
you know,

780
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:14,824
stresses of social comparisons produce 
greater vulnerability to stress related 

781
00:43:19,991 --> 00:43:22,000
diseases and Admin,
fap,

782
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,013
many diseases,
most diseases maybe even are stress 

783
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,850
related in their ultimate impacts on 
people.

784
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:28,923
Um,
so there's this one sociological study 

785
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:31,893
by a guy named Shag at Ohio state,
which sought effects of economic 

786
00:43:36,911 --> 00:43:37,744
inequality of mortality in general,
and came to the conclusion that there 

787
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,430
the,
the effects were lag,

788
00:43:43,431 --> 00:43:44,264
that the maximum impact on current 
mortality was any quality seven years 

789
00:43:48,101 --> 00:43:50,020
ago,
which sounds kind of funny,

790
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,990
but he had analyses,
which seemed to show,

791
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,460
and I'm a bit wary about the legitimacy 
of these analyses,

792
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,303
but they seem to me to show and they 
seem to show to him that it equality of 

793
00:44:01,751 --> 00:44:06,010
a few years ago affects the chats that 
you'll die now.

794
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,050
Um,
net of the effects of,

795
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,680
you know,
age and sex and

796
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:12,183
other predictors of mortality and that 
there's sort of the Qbo and have 

797
00:44:16,211 --> 00:44:18,450
consequences of betty years of Mrj,
of,

798
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,370
of past inequality.
So seven years ago was the worst,

799
00:44:21,371 --> 00:44:26,371
but six and eight also battered 
additively five years ago and died years

800
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:30,010
ago also mattered additively 10 years 
ago also mattered.

801
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,083
So that how bad inequality was in your 
past seems to affect your likelihood of 

802
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:38,820
dying.
Now the effects of violence have a,

803
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:39,923
have a look dead.
It's hard to figure out how you could 

804
00:44:41,701 --> 00:44:45,030
get a decent enough data set to do that,
right?

805
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:47,160
But I don't think it's impossible

806
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,253
health effects.
So I'm going to lay out an account of 

807
00:44:52,511 --> 00:44:53,344
the men.
You can tell me what you think about 

808
00:44:54,671 --> 00:44:55,391
this.
And all right,

809
00:44:55,391 --> 00:44:57,940
so you're,
you're,

810
00:44:57,941 --> 00:44:58,774
you're,
you're,

811
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:02,680
you're brain is always trying to 
calculate to some degree how good things

812
00:45:02,681 --> 00:45:03,514
are going for you.
And that's an extraordinarily difficult 

813
00:45:05,201 --> 00:45:06,034
calculation because life is uncertain 
and ultimately uncertain and it's 

814
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:14,800
difficult to predict the future except 
perhaps by using the past as a marker.

815
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:15,993
And so what seems to happen is that our 
nervous and our nervous systems are 

816
00:45:19,421 --> 00:45:20,254
always interested in how prepared we 
should be for emergency at any given 

817
00:45:23,231 --> 00:45:25,810
moment.
And as far as I can tell there,

818
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:28,240
there are a number of ways that we 
calibrate that.

819
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:32,140
One is baseline levels of trait 
neuroticism,

820
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:36,190
so that sensitivity to anxiety and 
uncertainty and emotional pain.

821
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:40,060
And so you seem to be born roughly 
speaking at a,

822
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,183
at,
at an at your average level of 

823
00:45:43,511 --> 00:45:44,344
neuroticism,
which can vary substantially between 

824
00:45:45,851 --> 00:45:46,180
people.

825
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:50,620
It can be also adjusted at puberty and 
then the environment can move you in one

826
00:45:50,621 --> 00:45:52,630
direction or another.
So for example,

827
00:45:52,631 --> 00:45:53,464
if you have a highly anxious child and 
you encourage them to go out and 

828
00:45:56,801 --> 00:45:57,634
explore,
then you can move them towards the 

829
00:45:59,201 --> 00:46:02,290
normal range of Jerry Kagan has 
demonstrated that quite nicely.

830
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:03,310
Okay.
So the first,

831
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,473
the first estimate of how worried you 
should be about the future is like 

832
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:12,100
genetic roll of the dice.
Some people will be born extraordinarily

833
00:46:12,101 --> 00:46:13,570
worried,
roughly speaking,

834
00:46:13,571 --> 00:46:16,150
and some people would be born hardly 
worried at all.

835
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,193
And then that can be modified by the,
by the particulars of the social 

836
00:46:19,961 --> 00:46:21,400
environment.
Right.

837
00:46:21,401 --> 00:46:22,234
So then the next thing it seems to me to
be part of the calculation is 

838
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:26,583
comparison.
How well are you doing compared to 

839
00:46:28,601 --> 00:46:29,434
others?
That seems to be adjusted by mechanisms 

840
00:46:32,141 --> 00:46:36,100
that associate perceived social status 
with Serotonin,

841
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:40,630
serotonergic activity such that as you 
move up a dominance hierarchy,

842
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:41,693
you're,
your serotonin levels rise so that your 

843
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:45,903
impulsivity,
which would be partly sensitive 

844
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:51,190
sensitivity to immediate reward 
declines.

845
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:54,580
And so does your sensitivity to negative
emotion.

846
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:58,570
Whereas if you plummet down to the 
bottom of a hierarchy,

847
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,470
you start to become more reward seeking 
and also more anxious.

848
00:47:02,471 --> 00:47:03,304
And the reason for that more anxious and
is because the bottom of the dominance 

849
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:07,624
hierarchy actually is a more dangerous 
place to be because you don't have 

850
00:47:10,121 --> 00:47:10,954
access to,
don't have reliable access as reliable 

851
00:47:14,051 --> 00:47:18,000
to shelter or food or mating resources 
or healthcare.

852
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:19,930
When you even see this in birds,
you know,

853
00:47:19,931 --> 00:47:21,070
so if,
uh,

854
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,190
a flu sweeps through an avian 
population,

855
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:28,450
it's the bedraggled birds at the bottom 
of the dominance hierarchy to die first.

856
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:33,970
And so then one more thing and then,
then I tell me what you think about this

857
00:47:33,971 --> 00:47:34,804
is that you have anything that seems to 
happen is that as you plummet down the 

858
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:38,734
dominance hierarchy and your mind 
settles into a more depressed and 

859
00:47:42,161 --> 00:47:42,994
anxious state,
the levels of cortisol that you produce 

860
00:47:45,641 --> 00:47:46,474
chronically rise and cortisol is a good 
hormone for activating you but in but 

861
00:47:51,131 --> 00:47:53,050
in,
but in high doses,

862
00:47:53,051 --> 00:47:55,960
high continual doses,
it starts to produce brain damage,

863
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:56,803
particularly in the hippocampus and it 
also suppresses immunological function 

864
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,360
which makes you more susceptible to 
infectious diseases.

865
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:05,463
So that seems to be approximately the 
process and so it's no wonder that 

866
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:10,210
people are trying to flee away from the 
bottom up,

867
00:48:10,211 --> 00:48:12,610
the dominance hierarchy.
Does that seem reasonable?

868
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:14,550
Yes.
Give me a,

869
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:15,960
give me a moment.
I've got a cough,

870
00:48:15,961 --> 00:48:17,190
a blow by note.
Okay.

871
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:30,710
Hay fever season in southern Ontario.
Okay.

872
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,113
Yeah.
I wish I were a better behavioral 

873
00:48:34,201 --> 00:48:35,034
endocrinologist and a do a bit more with
more expert in some of the processes 

874
00:48:40,411 --> 00:48:41,244
that you're talking about,
but a lot of that makes sense to be the 

875
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,590
fraught social comparisons.
I mean,

876
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:51,010
the evidence certainly is that it's more
stressful to be low.

877
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,500
Right?
Can you bet a high rank Kagan,

878
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,880
we've had a little myth that all hot,
big,

879
00:48:56,881 --> 00:48:59,620
a very high rank puts all this burden of
decision making.

880
00:48:59,621 --> 00:49:01,350
He got you and that's terribly 
stressful.

881
00:49:01,351 --> 00:49:03,630
It makes you vulnerable to heart attack 
and Blah Blah Blah.

882
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:06,690
And the day to say the opposite,
the data say that's not true.

883
00:49:06,691 --> 00:49:10,890
The more power and status if you like 
decision making authority,

884
00:49:10,891 --> 00:49:11,724
you have the less vulnerable,
you seem to be distressed related 

885
00:49:14,641 --> 00:49:16,630
diseases.
So you know,

886
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:19,530
a lot of what you're saying makes,
makes evident sense to me.

887
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:21,960
Then the developmental story that you're
telling.

888
00:49:21,961 --> 00:49:22,794
I mean I,
I,

889
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,520
I think it's right that people,
I don't,

890
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:31,650
I don't know how important the uh,
throw up the genetic diocese.

891
00:49:31,831 --> 00:49:35,010
I think it's an extremely interesting 
puzzle,

892
00:49:35,011 --> 00:49:35,844
evolutionarily.
Why there's is much heritable genetic 

893
00:49:38,761 --> 00:49:42,570
variability in CBE.
Equally important domains as there is,

894
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,790
and I'm not convinced anybody has,
you know,

895
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:46,980
real really understands what bond you 
weights,

896
00:49:46,981 --> 00:49:49,230
how much variability there is.
But any case,

897
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,380
um,
that things are adjustable,

898
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:57,500
it responds to what you encounter.
And and a response to social status,

899
00:49:58,111 --> 00:49:58,944
perceived social status of responses,
social comparisons makes evident sense 

900
00:50:03,451 --> 00:50:04,284
to me and again I,
I don't know enough about the putative 

901
00:50:10,381 --> 00:50:11,214
damaging affects of excessively 
prolonged exposure to say high cortisol 

902
00:50:16,981 --> 00:50:17,814
levels to be sure whether there isn't 
still sub adaptation sub actual 

903
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:29,660
functionality to the response to long 
term exposure lurking beneath the sea.

904
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:30,933
Big breakdown in the system because it 
just seems to me that sort of a 

905
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,290
Darwinian,
not evolutionary.

906
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,410
Um,
social scientists said psychiatrists and

907
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:44,411
psychologists have been too quick too
a soup pathology when they see states of

908
00:50:48,241 --> 00:50:51,300
affairs that do a deed have damaging 
consequences,

909
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:54,130
but they had subbed nevertheless have 
some utility.

910
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,940
I,
I wish I do a little more about,

911
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,253
I think both the low serotonin and the 
high cortisol levels are interesting in 

912
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:01,004
that regard because what does happen is 
the combination of those two things 

913
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:09,371
makes you a more impulsive and be more 
prepared for emergency action.

914
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:13,430
Both of those things are very useful in 
an uncertain environment.

915
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:14,963
Detrimental.
The detrimental consequences seem to 

916
00:51:17,211 --> 00:51:19,640
occur as a consequence of prolonged 
overload.

917
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:20,503
Is that because your body is utilizing,
imagine what your body is doing is 

918
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:25,454
utilizing more units of resource per 
moment of time because of the necessity 

919
00:51:30,111 --> 00:51:30,944
for preparation for unexpected events.
And that can become physiologically 

920
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:37,270
exhausting in the long run.
So I think it,

921
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:39,090
it does,
it,

922
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,353
it,
it seems to me that those biochemical 

923
00:51:42,261 --> 00:51:47,261
effects do underlie the sort of adaptive
responses that you described except that

924
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:51,410
you know,
too much is too much and if it's hard to

925
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:52,244
live at the bottom,
what that means is you age faster and 

926
00:51:53,991 --> 00:51:57,800
you don't live as long and you also have
higher susceptibility to disease.

927
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:58,723
And maybe in some sense that's the price
you pay for the adaptive impulsivity 

928
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:06,950
that's also necessary to give you a 
chance to shoot back up the hierarchy if

929
00:52:06,951 --> 00:52:08,600
that's the sort of thing that you're 
looking for.

930
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:09,651
Yeah,
no,

931
00:52:09,651 --> 00:52:10,484
and I,
I can't help thinking about sort of the 

932
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:15,920
evolutionary theories of,
uh,

933
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:21,460
of Senescence and bodily repair that,
uh,

934
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:22,943
or pioneer by Sir Peter Medawar back in 
the 50s and develop more by George 

935
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:28,350
Williams.
The idea that,

936
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,213
um,

937
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,793
betty,
betty things involve some sort of trade 

938
00:52:33,271 --> 00:52:38,271
off between expenditure for expenditure 
of energy,

939
00:52:39,121 --> 00:52:39,954
of accumulative resources,
of capacity in the pursuit of something 

940
00:52:43,081 --> 00:52:48,081
now at the expense of
reduced capacity to be successful later.

941
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:53,010
Um,
and so you know,

942
00:52:53,011 --> 00:52:56,760
what breeze of why these chronic states 
may have logged herb.

943
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:57,873
I'm a damaging effects is because 
selection against big of these chronic 

944
00:53:01,381 --> 00:53:02,214
states has not been strong because those
who are in them for a long time didn't 

945
00:53:06,541 --> 00:53:09,180
historically tend to live very long 
anyway.

946
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:10,200
And they're,
they're being,

947
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,513
if you like,
motivated or prepared to engage at a 

948
00:53:14,371 --> 00:53:18,300
high risk activities that at least have 
subjects of short term payoff,

949
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:20,340
which is more or less what you said 
actually.

950
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:21,871
Well,
and you know,

951
00:53:21,871 --> 00:53:25,230
you talked about miss,
let's call it a misbegotten,

952
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:28,490
that there's stress at the top of the 
dominance hierarchy,

953
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,333
just like there is stress at the bottom 
and the stress at the top is 

954
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:34,080
responsibility and decision making and 
all of that.

955
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:35,380
And you know,
I,

956
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:38,310
I do believe that there's truth in that,
but there's an important,

957
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,820
another important biological element 
that needs to be considered.

958
00:53:41,821 --> 00:53:42,930
And so there's,
uh,

959
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:43,883
there's plenty of work done in the 
domains of clinical psychology and some 

960
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:52,200
of this is psychophysiological and neuro
physiological for that matter,

961
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,573
showing that a stress of an equivalent 
magnitude as fewer negative effects if 

962
00:53:59,881 --> 00:54:03,720
it's taken on voluntarily.
So because what happens,

963
00:54:03,721 --> 00:54:07,830
what happens is that if you voluntarily 
engage in a stressful activity,

964
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,910
your approach systems are activated 
rather than your defense systems.

965
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:16,290
And the approach systems are associated 
with positive emotion and with,

966
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:17,170
and with much.

967
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:21,720
And where is the negative emotions are 
associated with this defensive posturing

968
00:54:21,721 --> 00:54:22,554
that includes preparation for emergency 
and that's much more physiologically 

969
00:54:25,621 --> 00:54:28,320
damaging.
And so whether something,

970
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:32,100
whether you pick up a load voluntarily 
or have it thrust upon you,

971
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:34,800
seems to make a big difference to how 
heavy it is.

972
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,060
And that's,
that's very,

973
00:54:36,061 --> 00:54:36,894
it's a very interesting piece of a set 
of research studies as far as I'm 

974
00:54:41,191 --> 00:54:42,024
concerned.
It's quite fascinating that that can be 

975
00:54:43,561 --> 00:54:45,000
the case.
Yeah.

976
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,850
Okay.
So let me ask you another question.

977
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,713
Let's get down to,
we might say brass tacks here so we can 

978
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:56,480
make a case that inequality destabilize 
the societies and,

979
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,413
and,
and cranks up the male on male homicide 

980
00:54:59,071 --> 00:54:59,904
rate and the destabilization of curves 
because young men become more and more 

981
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:04,674
unpredictable and violent.
And so you could make a conservative 

982
00:55:06,991 --> 00:55:07,824
case as well as the liberal case for not
having a society that takes inequality 

983
00:55:13,291 --> 00:55:16,770
to an extreme because conservatives,
at least in principle,

984
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:20,220
should be concerned with the maintenance
of social stability over the long run.

985
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,020
So,
but,

986
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:23,490
but,
okay.

987
00:55:23,491 --> 00:55:25,860
And so then you might make a case for 
income redistribution,

988
00:55:25,861 --> 00:55:26,694
but that gets very,
very troublesome because it's not that 

989
00:55:28,771 --> 00:55:29,604
easy to redistribute income.
And that's what I want to talk to you 

990
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:33,594
about.
So,

991
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,840
you know,
we're in a situation of course,

992
00:55:36,841 --> 00:55:39,890
where the top 1% of the population,
uh,

993
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:41,303
controls a substantial proportion of the
economic resources and the top 1% of 

994
00:55:45,391 --> 00:55:46,224
that top 1% controls the bulk of that.
Now I've looked into that quite deeply 

995
00:55:50,761 --> 00:55:55,761
and that that distribution is,
it's not a normal distribution of money.

996
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:57,023
It's a perigo distribution of money.
But the weird thing about pareto 

997
00:56:00,031 --> 00:56:02,730
distributions,
and so that's a distribution where many,

998
00:56:02,731 --> 00:56:04,950
many people end up with zero.
And you know,

999
00:56:04,951 --> 00:56:09,951
just a few people end up with a lot is 
that a prieto distribution characterizes

1000
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:13,440
zero sum games that are played out to 
their conclusion.

1001
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:16,140
So like monopoly,
everybody starts in the middle,

1002
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:17,003
but then random trading produces an 
eventual prieto shaped distribution 

1003
00:56:20,431 --> 00:56:23,590
where lots of people start to stack up 
on the loser side.

1004
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,633
One person accelerates towards victory 
until finally everyone's at zero except 

1005
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:28,984
one person.
So it's the logical outcome of random 

1006
00:56:31,151 --> 00:56:31,984
trading game.
So that's the first thing that's 

1007
00:56:33,461 --> 00:56:35,440
interesting about the prieto 
distribution.

1008
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,760
The second thing that's interesting is 
that pareto distributions,

1009
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:40,983
um,
they prieto distributions emerge in 

1010
00:56:43,481 --> 00:56:46,360
every domain of creative human 
production,

1011
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,420
not just the distribution of money.
So for example,

1012
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:50,953
we did an analysis of the,
of creative achievement across the 

1013
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:56,330
lifespan using uh,
using,

1014
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:57,203
uh,
an instrument called the creative 

1015
00:56:58,271 --> 00:56:59,104
achievement questionnaire.
So what it did was assess people's 

1016
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:06,190
levels of competence across 13 potential
domains of creative activity.

1017
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:09,940
And so we were looking at production 
rather than creative thinking per se,

1018
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,013
right?
Although those two things are related 

1019
00:57:12,071 --> 00:57:12,904
and quite tightly,
we wanted to know who actually 

1020
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:16,810
accomplished things in the world.

1021
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:20,080
And so for musical ability,
for example,

1022
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:24,380
the zero score would be,
I have no training or,

1023
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:28,660
or talent in this area.
And the maximum score would be,

1024
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:29,770
you know,
my,

1025
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:32,230
my comp,
my original compositions of being played

1026
00:57:32,231 --> 00:57:33,064
for international audiences.
And so we've now administered that to 

1027
00:57:35,921 --> 00:57:36,754
hunt to hundreds of people.
And the median score is zero across all 

1028
00:57:39,971 --> 00:57:42,070
13 domains.
It's a very,

1029
00:57:42,071 --> 00:57:43,100
very,
uh,

1030
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:44,373
precise burrito distribution with a few 
people who are the outliers producing 

1031
00:57:47,861 --> 00:57:51,160
the overwhelming majority of the goods.
And you also,

1032
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:54,570
and that there's a,
there's also a law that desota price,

1033
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:57,790
uh,
came up with back in the 1960s governing

1034
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:03,060
the output of scientific papers.
And he found that the square root of the

1035
00:58:03,161 --> 00:58:07,600
number of people operating within an 
academic domain produced half the papers

1036
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,760
that were published in that domain.
Right?

1037
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:10,740
So,
you know,

1038
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:11,643
so that's not so bad if there's 10 
researchers because then three of them 

1039
00:58:14,141 --> 00:58:15,970
are producing half the papers.

1040
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:19,300
But if there's a thousand researchers 
operating in a domain,

1041
00:58:19,301 --> 00:58:21,880
then 30 of them are producing half the 
papers.

1042
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,373
Okay,
so and then one more complication and 

1043
00:58:25,031 --> 00:58:29,410
then I'm going to let you let you have 
at this.

1044
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,633
So I'd be looking for,
now you can think that the prio 

1045
00:58:32,681 --> 00:58:33,514
distribution,
which by the way characterizes the 

1046
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,450
distribution of wealth in every known 
society,

1047
00:58:37,451 --> 00:58:41,350
although the degree to which the 
distribution is skewed differs.

1048
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:46,540
You can say that the Prieto distribution
is a consequence of the,

1049
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:49,420
of the final playing out of a random 
trading game.

1050
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,493
But then here's the complication.
This is something that's been bothering 

1051
00:58:53,801 --> 00:58:54,634
me for years.
There are predictors of longterm life 

1052
00:58:58,181 --> 00:58:59,014
success in relatively stable societies 
and the best predictors are in this 

1053
00:59:04,601 --> 00:59:06,760
order.
The first predictor is Iq,

1054
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,840
the second predictor is trait 
conscientiousness and it's about half as

1055
00:59:10,841 --> 00:59:11,674
powerful as Iq.
And the third predictor is low 

1056
00:59:13,661 --> 00:59:17,470
neuroticism and it's about half as 
powerful as conscientiousness.

1057
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:21,890
So if you get a good measure of Iq and a
good measure of conscientiousness,

1058
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:26,150
then you can predict about 25% of the 
variance in performance,

1059
00:59:26,151 --> 00:59:30,290
especially across managerial,
administrative and academic domains.

1060
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:33,410
And then with regards to entrepreneurial
performance,

1061
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:38,030
you can use Iq and trade openness,
which is the creativity measure.

1062
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,313
So there are powerful individual 
differences that are driving 

1063
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:46,400
differential performance and also 
driving this prieto distribution.

1064
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:51,410
And so it's not merely a random game,
although how these people manage to make

1065
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:55,520
it into not a random game is beyond me.
But there is evidence that,

1066
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,533
that our society does hierarchically 
arrange itself at least to some degree 

1067
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:01,124
by ability and competence.
And so then the question is how do you 

1068
01:00:04,311 --> 01:00:09,311
factor that into the equation when 
you're thinking about practical,

1069
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,753
let's call them income.
I don't think it's so much income 

1070
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:13,993
redistribution is that it's an attempt 
by society to stop too many people from 

1071
01:00:17,421 --> 01:00:18,254
stacking up at zero and therefore 
logically turning to violence and that 

1072
01:00:22,071 --> 01:00:23,360
sort of thing as an alternative.

1073
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:27,030
Well,
as well as an attempt to just

1074
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:33,180
improve the level of justice in society.
The idea,

1075
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:33,931
you know,
I mean,

1076
01:00:33,931 --> 01:00:34,764
especially if there's an element,
a strong element of randomness and who 

1077
01:00:37,171 --> 01:00:38,004
ends up where then there's something 
unjust about large numbers being stuck 

1078
01:00:41,491 --> 01:00:42,900
down at the Xero.
But,

1079
01:00:42,901 --> 01:00:44,340
uh,
you know,

1080
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,400
you say how is it possible to 
redistribute,

1081
01:00:47,401 --> 01:00:49,590
but countries vary and the extent which 
they do this,

1082
01:00:49,591 --> 01:00:53,070
they very into the extent to which they 
tax inheritance,

1083
01:00:53,071 --> 01:00:58,071
they value barrier and the extent to 
which they tax liar or cubs of they vary

1084
01:00:58,621 --> 01:00:59,454
and the extent to which they provide 
education and health care try provide 

1085
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:08,040
relatively a universally trying to make 
opportunity,

1086
01:01:08,041 --> 01:01:12,210
relatively universal.
They vary in these things and you know,

1087
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:14,753
some of the happiest countries in the 
world and I think the most productive 

1088
01:01:17,221 --> 01:01:18,780
countries in the world,
um,

1089
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:19,643
the Nordic countries,
Japan have the relatively equitable 

1090
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:27,930
because they rigged this gay board that 
some other countries if you like.

1091
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:29,550
Uh,
so you know,

1092
01:01:29,551 --> 01:01:30,660
you say that,
uh,

1093
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:34,620
what stacks up at the top tend to be the
most competent creative people.

1094
01:01:34,621 --> 01:01:35,454
And to imply that to some degree we have
a meritocracy and to some degree we do 

1095
01:01:39,001 --> 01:01:41,190
have a shock.
But you know,

1096
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:43,043
the four wall Bollard Bard ehrs have as 
much wealth as the hundred billion 

1097
01:01:47,641 --> 01:01:51,960
poorest Americans putting together.
And they did nothing to earn it.

1098
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:54,420
You could say,
well,

1099
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:58,920
they're high quality people because they
got half of their genes from Sam Walton.

1100
01:01:58,921 --> 01:02:00,450
Did he did something.
Darn it.

1101
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:01,463
Um,
that seems like a pretty weak argument 

1102
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:05,220
for why they should control that much.
Well,

1103
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:06,403
if,
if inheritance were more severely taxed 

1104
01:02:09,361 --> 01:02:11,730
in order to provide public goods for 
everybody,

1105
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,440
would this society to be worse off 
would,

1106
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:15,323
um,
flattening out that curve of 

1107
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:20,340
accomplished but actually reduced?
You know,

1108
01:02:20,341 --> 01:02:21,340
I think there's some,
there,

1109
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:22,383
there's some evidence.
I wish I could pull it to the forefront 

1110
01:02:24,251 --> 01:02:29,251
of my mind about the utility of 
distributing grab buddy,

1111
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:30,543
uh,
more or less equitably and certain 

1112
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:33,643
sciences,
the amount of science you get for your 

1113
01:02:35,431 --> 01:02:38,640
buck is better.
Where you give lots of lots of people,

1114
01:02:38,641 --> 01:02:41,520
relatively small grants that will,
you give us a small number of people,

1115
01:02:41,521 --> 01:02:42,790
relatively large grades.

1116
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:44,463
That's interesting because I've worked 
in the grant system in the u s and 

1117
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,260
Canada and the grant system in the u s 
is more of the,

1118
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,290
give a few people a huge amount of money
for variety.

1119
01:02:53,291 --> 01:02:56,750
And in Canada it's distributed more 
equitably.

1120
01:02:56,751 --> 01:03:01,210
And I must say that I vastly prefer the 
Canadian system now.

1121
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:01,560
Okay.

1122
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,393
I agree with you and I think the 
Canadian system has been moving 

1123
01:03:04,441 --> 01:03:06,360
regrettably of the direction of the 
American.

1124
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:07,373
I mean,
it partly depends on the field of 

1125
01:03:07,861 --> 01:03:08,611
science.
Of course,

1126
01:03:08,611 --> 01:03:09,630
if you need a buddy,
hey,

1127
01:03:09,631 --> 01:03:12,690
drug collider,
that you need billions,

1128
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:13,523
millions of dollars if you're a 
psychologist like you or be a thing to 

1129
01:03:17,371 --> 01:03:18,204
seem to work better in many ways.
When you fund the higher proportion of 

1130
01:03:22,171 --> 01:03:26,610
grads with a lower variance,
the amount awarded.

1131
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,420
What I first came to mcmaster,
there was exactly,

1132
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,153
oh no,
I shouldn't say what I first came by by 

1133
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:34,283
saying let's say the late eighties and 
early nineties essentially everybody in 

1134
01:03:39,001 --> 01:03:39,834
the department how to research grab from
either end circ that the natural 

1135
01:03:43,771 --> 01:03:46,470
sciences and Engineering Research 
Council of Canada or sure.

1136
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:49,220
The social sciences and Humanities 
Research Council of Canada,

1137
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,570
usually the former at our particular 
department,

1138
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:54,750
everybody in the department had an 
active research lab.

1139
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:58,860
Everybody created the opportunity for 
two or three students to do a bachelor's

1140
01:03:58,861 --> 01:04:02,390
thesis of their lab each year.
That would things get more variable.

1141
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,810
People Start People's people who are 
being productive,

1142
01:04:04,811 --> 01:04:08,100
who are getting out of scientific paper 
or to doing decent work,

1143
01:04:08,101 --> 01:04:11,290
making a contribution to knowledge when 
they start big to die.

1144
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:13,050
These grads,
you know,

1145
01:04:13,051 --> 01:04:17,040
like you refuse to or three times of the
competition say,

1146
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:18,390
well the hell with it.
You know,

1147
01:04:18,391 --> 01:04:22,040
I mean I've got tell you I've got a good
pinch of wind up.

1148
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:23,820
I think I'll become a real estate 
speculator.

1149
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:25,560
The opportunities for

1150
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,313
the dissemination of research 
opportunity to a larger number of 

1151
01:04:31,751 --> 01:04:33,970
students shrink.
Um,

1152
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:35,283
I think it's,
it's been a disaster in surgery or I 

1153
01:04:37,841 --> 01:04:38,610
guess,
you know,

1154
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:41,100
an area where I was raised animal 
behavior studies.

1155
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:47,610
If you just look at either the number of
papers in top ranked journals by country

1156
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:50,013
according to how they allocate their 
funds or how much buddy is allocated to 

1157
01:04:53,291 --> 01:04:54,124
it,
the buddy allocated to it as the less 

1158
01:04:55,631 --> 01:04:59,080
strong predictor of you'd expect of the 
equitability is a stronger predictor.

1159
01:04:59,290 --> 01:05:00,123
Sweet and Canada used to,
last time I looked both reg far above 

1160
01:05:04,391 --> 01:05:05,224
the United States in numbers of papers 
per capita getting into top quality 

1161
01:05:10,811 --> 01:05:14,700
research gertels inedible behavior.
It's one little addict.

1162
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:15,910
Don't know way,
but uh,

1163
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:18,160
but I would be very,
if there's some

1164
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,580
generality to this flowed well,
are there,

1165
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:22,110
I wonder though,
um,

1166
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:23,133
to play devil's advocate,
that's the thing about distributing 

1167
01:05:25,691 --> 01:05:26,524
research funds more equitably is that 
you are distributing them among a 

1168
01:05:29,531 --> 01:05:30,364
population that's already being 
extraordinarily highly selected for 

1169
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:33,523
capability.
And so it seems counterproductive 

1170
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:39,370
because it's for all the flaws of the 
university system,

1171
01:05:39,371 --> 01:05:42,670
which are manifold.
It is still extraordinarily difficult to

1172
01:05:42,671 --> 01:05:43,950
become a professor.
It's a,

1173
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,073
it's a multitiered selection system.
And so the people who do become 

1174
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:53,170
professors are on average,
very intelligent and on average,

1175
01:05:53,171 --> 01:05:54,004
very hardworking.
And we know that because we know what 

1176
01:05:55,781 --> 01:05:56,614
the predictors are of success in 
academia and its intelligence and 

1177
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:01,670
conscientiousness,
unsurprisingly,

1178
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:05,100
although creativity seems to play almost
zero rule had that.

1179
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,700
Well the thing,
yeah,

1180
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:09,760
but that's partly because you know,
sciences and algorithmic gay,

1181
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:10,623
right.
And just beating away at it busily is a 

1182
01:06:13,061 --> 01:06:14,620
very,
very powerful mechanism.

1183
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,290
So I'm not the least bit cynical about 
that.

1184
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,780
I mean the reason that science works is 
because it's,

1185
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:22,840
in some sense it has the aspect of 
factory production.

1186
01:06:22,841 --> 01:06:23,674
It can be distributed.
Anyone can learn to do it and you get 

1187
01:06:26,261 --> 01:06:28,990
along way is by nibbling at the edges.
You know,

1188
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:32,410
it's continual,
continual slow progress when millions of

1189
01:06:32,411 --> 01:06:34,960
people are doing it is progress.
That's plenty rapid.

1190
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:37,120
So,
okay,

1191
01:06:37,121 --> 01:06:37,954
so,
so there are definitely situations in 

1192
01:06:39,281 --> 01:06:43,000
which denying people resources seems to 
be completely counterproductive and that

1193
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:44,860
would be one of them.
So

1194
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,360
now the other question though is I would
say,

1195
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,233
and also that's the thing,
there's also an effective means of 

1196
01:06:53,081 --> 01:06:56,590
funneling resources to let's say a wide 
range of professors.

1197
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:57,513
It actually works the problem.
One of the problems with general income 

1198
01:07:00,761 --> 01:07:02,800
redistribution is,
as far as I can tell,

1199
01:07:02,801 --> 01:07:05,050
is that we don't really know how to do 
it very well.

1200
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:07,270
And one of the,
I mean look here,

1201
01:07:07,271 --> 01:07:08,104
here's an example.
You can tell me what you think about 

1202
01:07:09,341 --> 01:07:11,440
this.
So I used to work,

1203
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,060
I used to live in northern Alberta when 
the oil price,

1204
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:15,850
sporadic oil,
oops were going on.

1205
01:07:15,851 --> 01:07:16,684
And my observation was that if you 
wanted to make money in Alberta when an 

1206
01:07:21,161 --> 01:07:24,370
oil boom was going on,
you didn't go out and work on the rigs.

1207
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:25,413
Although if you did that,
you could make a tremendous amount of 

1208
01:07:27,281 --> 01:07:28,114
money.
Now it was all young men who did that 

1209
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:32,500
pretty much say between the ages of 16 
and 25,

1210
01:07:32,501 --> 01:07:33,334
something like that.
And they were making fantastic amounts 

1211
01:07:35,291 --> 01:07:36,124
of money,
but they verged almost all of them came 

1212
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:39,514
out of it with nothing to show for it 
because they would work for two weeks 

1213
01:07:42,821 --> 01:07:43,654
and then go into town and it doesn't 
have a blowout party for four days and 

1214
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:50,410
spent everything they got and expensive 
cars and wreck them and so forth.

1215
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:52,580
So it was reckless behavior.
Um,

1216
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,810
that I think was a kid in some sense to 
that,

1217
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:56,740
to that,
uh,

1218
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:58,600
to the,
to the steep dominance,

1219
01:07:58,601 --> 01:08:01,090
hierarchy,
violence and that sort of thing.

1220
01:08:01,091 --> 01:08:01,924
That for status seeking that you're 
describing the people who really made 

1221
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:08,290
money where the bartenders,
right,

1222
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:09,121
because they,
they,

1223
01:08:09,121 --> 01:08:11,980
they absorbed all the,
all the excess profits.

1224
01:08:11,981 --> 01:08:12,814
And actually generally,
generally speaking or comparatively 

1225
01:08:15,681 --> 01:08:16,514
speaking,
we're able to utilize the money 

1226
01:08:18,441 --> 01:08:19,550
properly.
Now,

1227
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:24,440
the point I'm making is that an oil boom
isn't very effective way of distributing

1228
01:08:24,441 --> 01:08:25,274
wealth down the economic louder.
But it didn't necessarily seem to me to 

1229
01:08:28,641 --> 01:08:29,474
be a very effective one because it 
didn't because the money flowed back up 

1230
01:08:33,201 --> 01:08:36,800
to the top 1% damn near as fast as you 
can shovel it downwards.

1231
01:08:36,801 --> 01:08:37,634
And that's,
that's the thing about that damn prieto 

1232
01:08:39,471 --> 01:08:43,010
distribution is that it's,
it seems there are people,

1233
01:08:43,011 --> 01:08:43,844
there's,
there's a,

1234
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,433
there's a group,
there's a scientific subfield called 

1235
01:08:47,691 --> 01:08:48,524
econo physicists and they actually,
they actually modeled the distribution 

1236
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:57,500
of money in an economy using the same 
equations that model the distribution of

1237
01:08:57,501 --> 01:08:58,940
a gas into a vacuum.

1238
01:08:59,690 --> 01:09:04,690
So there's something that's natural law 
like about this that the economists call

1239
01:09:05,061 --> 01:09:06,530
it the matthew principle,
right?

1240
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:07,423
To those who have everything more will 
be given and from those who have 

1241
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:11,450
nothing,
everything will be taken.

1242
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:12,284
And I don't think that we've done a good
job of grappling with the actual 

1243
01:09:15,321 --> 01:09:19,220
complexity of this and we tend to split 
up into politically opposed,

1244
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:20,413
uh,
what would you call camps and argue 

1245
01:09:22,101 --> 01:09:24,770
about the,
the solution to inequality.

1246
01:09:24,771 --> 01:09:27,710
And the left wing solution is something 
like,

1247
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:29,240
you know,
distribute the money,

1248
01:09:29,241 --> 01:09:32,480
take it from the rich,
especially they undeserving rich.

1249
01:09:32,481 --> 01:09:36,560
If you can identify them and give it to 
the poor and the conservatives say,

1250
01:09:36,561 --> 01:09:39,530
well no,
the poorest of the poor should bootstrap

1251
01:09:39,531 --> 01:09:43,190
themselves up and maybe be provided with
more opportunity and that might equalize

1252
01:09:43,191 --> 01:09:44,024
things.
But it isn't clear to me that we're 

1253
01:09:45,231 --> 01:09:47,960
actually grappling with the magnitude of
the problem.

1254
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:49,303
No,
it isn't clear

1255
01:09:49,330 --> 01:09:50,163
either.
But what you say about equalizing 

1256
01:09:51,931 --> 01:09:52,764
opportunity for example,
is it a set to distributing the 

1257
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:55,763
resources because one way you equalize 
opportunity is by having universal high 

1258
01:09:59,941 --> 01:10:04,440
quality health care that's paid for by 
sub sort of government.

1259
01:10:04,441 --> 01:10:07,350
Wherever you sub taxes picked up 
somewhere.

1260
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:09,850
Um,
free education,

1261
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,810
universal access to education is 
certainly another,

1262
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:16,650
that's,
you know,

1263
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:20,970
it's another way that an effect you 
create a more egalitarian society.

1264
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:21,900
So,
I mean there are,

1265
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:24,520
there are certain domains,
certainly education and healthcare,

1266
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,700
maybe some others that are not spraying 
to mine.

1267
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:27,893
Well I suppose the improvement of 
various sorts of infra infrastructure 

1268
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,330
that,
you know,

1269
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:33,630
make it easier to get from point a to 
point b.

1270
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:35,220
Um,
you know,

1271
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:38,090
public,
publicly subsidized treads,

1272
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:40,590
things like that can certainly be 
contributors as well.

1273
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,300
Now that's equalizing it.
It's all right.

1274
01:10:42,301 --> 01:10:45,330
You don't have to take anybody a give to
get specifically to anybody else.

1275
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:47,720
Then there's things like a guaranteed 
minimum,

1276
01:10:47,721 --> 01:10:50,670
a big cub at first.
It sounds like a crazy idea.

1277
01:10:50,671 --> 01:10:51,690
The idea that,
you know,

1278
01:10:51,691 --> 01:10:52,524
you should just,
we should take government accrued 

1279
01:10:56,341 --> 01:10:57,174
resources which comes from some sort of 
taxation and we should just make sure 

1280
01:10:59,911 --> 01:11:04,380
everybody has 15,000 bucks a year to 
start or something like that.

1281
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:05,463
Um,
it sounds kind of wacky because they 

1282
01:11:07,561 --> 01:11:10,530
standard argument against it from the 
right has been that,

1283
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:14,670
well underbite incentives and nobody 
will produce all if you know,

1284
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:19,170
if we could all be welfare rights,
well want to be welfare queens mostly.

1285
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:23,590
And where this stuff has been tried by 
understanding is that,

1286
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:28,290
that it's been surprisingly successful 
that there was an experiment better Toba

1287
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:32,190
where a minimum big cub was tried for 
awhile where,

1288
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:35,370
Gosh,
yeah,

1289
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:40,350
I remember that
[inaudible] about to try it.

1290
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,980
Manatoba Toba has tried it.
It was an NDP government I think,

1291
01:11:43,981 --> 01:11:46,680
which them what replaced by conservative
or,

1292
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,760
or nominally liberal governor,
but um,

1293
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:51,143
then sort of cad the results.
But the results came to light later and 

1294
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:55,644
showed that for example,
the number of people who chose not to 

1295
01:11:57,931 --> 01:12:00,560
work did not go up under this,
uh,

1296
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:04,110
at that have various beneficial effects.
And I think rebates,

1297
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:04,944
vc,
but I think even the idea of putting 

1298
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:07,824
buddy in the heads of everybody from the
great collective wealth that has 

1299
01:12:11,821 --> 01:12:15,450
accumulated,
could be socially beneficial,

1300
01:12:15,451 --> 01:12:18,480
could be economically beneficial.
It could be environmentally beneficial.

1301
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:24,450
Certainly the debates like education and
health care,

1302
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:27,420
that's in effect a kind of 
redistribution,

1303
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:31,440
right?
That seems easy to effectuate.

1304
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:32,453
I mean,
easy it not easy to effectuate in terms 

1305
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:40,050
of convincing people politically or,
or overcoming the propaganda against it.

1306
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,260
But
we don't have a whole bunch of a,

1307
01:12:43,261 --> 01:12:48,261
obviously a whole bunch of of our wealth
is embodied in the infrastructure.

1308
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:51,000
Yes.
Really noticed this for example,

1309
01:12:51,001 --> 01:12:51,834
when I lived in Montreal because 
Montreal is a great city and one of the 

1310
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:59,190
things that distinguishes Montreal for 
most cities that I've lived in,

1311
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:03,960
uh,
especially western cities is that people

1312
01:13:03,961 --> 01:13:06,540
live in the city.
They don't live in their houses.

1313
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:07,613
Yes.
And the fact that the city is 

1314
01:13:09,331 --> 01:13:12,000
extraordinarily livable so you can walk 
everywhere.

1315
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:14,520
There's always something to do that's 
exciting.

1316
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:15,533
There's a tremendously active street 
life means that there's access to 

1317
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:20,213
infrastructure and social capital 
related wealth just distributed 

1318
01:13:24,031 --> 01:13:24,864
everywhere.

1319
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:27,330
And that's a lovely thing.
Um,

1320
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:30,450
so I see cows,
I'm kind of looking for solutions to the

1321
01:13:30,451 --> 01:13:31,284
prieto distribution problem that 
conservatives and liberals alike could 

1322
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:35,183
agree upon.
And so some of those you outlined 

1323
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:38,633
improve the infrastructure of our 
society because those are public goods 

1324
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:44,760
that benefit everyone.
Then also improve productivity.

1325
01:13:44,761 --> 01:13:46,620
It seems to be no downside to that at 
all.

1326
01:13:46,621 --> 01:13:47,454
Also raises employment,
improve the quality of education right 

1327
01:13:51,181 --> 01:13:52,014
from right from day one,
which is something that I think we do a 

1328
01:13:54,121 --> 01:13:56,100
very bad job of.
Um,

1329
01:13:56,380 --> 01:13:59,000
uh,
and then the issue with healthcare,

1330
01:13:59,070 --> 01:13:59,903
it's my understanding that the Canadian 
healthcare system for it and it has 

1331
01:14:03,301 --> 01:14:04,720
flaws,
um,

1332
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:07,740
because it's of course dealing with an 
impossible problem,

1333
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:12,460
um,
still uses much less of its capital

1334
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:15,010
on maintaining itself.
And for example,

1335
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:16,003
um,
having to maintain an infrastructure 

1336
01:14:17,981 --> 01:14:18,814
that collects money.
I know that the hospitals in the u s 

1337
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:22,353
spend something,
some substantial proportion of the 

1338
01:14:24,371 --> 01:14:26,680
revenue,
I can't remember precisely,

1339
01:14:26,681 --> 01:14:29,770
but it's between 17 and 30%,
if I remember correctly.

1340
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:33,370
Just gathering the money for their 
services,

1341
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:35,910
which seems to be rather counter 
productive use of the [inaudible]

1342
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:39,520
resources.
I wonder how much is spent on billboards

1343
01:14:39,521 --> 01:14:43,550
advertising their hospitals to drive the
interstate highways of the,

1344
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:48,610
it's astonishing how much
information about,

1345
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:49,583
you know,
cub to such and such where we have the 

1346
01:14:51,191 --> 01:14:55,390
best cancer doctors that it isn't well 
and the,

1347
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:57,520
and Americans pay a lot for their 
healthcare.

1348
01:14:58,150 --> 01:14:59,640
They do it easily.
Did they do indeed.

1349
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:02,610
I spent three years there recently and 
uh,

1350
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:03,933
we paid a lot for healthcare coverage 
that turned out not in fact to be held 

1351
01:15:08,721 --> 01:15:10,930
up thorough a coverage.
Right.

1352
01:15:10,931 --> 01:15:12,310
Well,
when I lived in the states do,

1353
01:15:12,311 --> 01:15:13,144
and I have decent coverage,
I was teaching in Boston there I had a 

1354
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:17,950
pretty good program,
but it wasn't,

1355
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:18,950
I wouldn't say it was

1356
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:22,240
manifestly different from my Canadian 
experience,

1357
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,193
which has been mixed.
But of course it is very important to 

1358
01:15:25,751 --> 01:15:26,584
note that hell that making people 
healthy is impossible because everybody 

1359
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:33,580
gets sick and ages and dies.
And so it's an impossible task.

1360
01:15:33,581 --> 01:15:34,414
And it also indicates to me that that's 
perhaps one of the reasons why it 

1361
01:15:37,391 --> 01:15:38,224
doesn't fit so nicely into a free market
model because the free market assumes 

1362
01:15:43,151 --> 01:15:43,984
that there's not infinite demand for 
something and there is actually near 

1363
01:15:46,571 --> 01:15:48,100
infinite demand for healthcare,

1364
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:51,650
especially if they're dying.
There's that and there's also just,

1365
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:52,400
you know,
it's,

1366
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,490
it's an impossible problem because of 
the aging population.

1367
01:15:55,491 --> 01:15:58,850
It's an impossible problem because you 
know,

1368
01:15:58,851 --> 01:16:03,851
governments have one of the determinants
of the costs of the healthcare system is

1369
01:16:03,951 --> 01:16:04,784
held many empties.
You've got out there billing it and 

1370
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:07,303
governments have a tendency to one 
respond to this by restricting the 

1371
01:16:12,471 --> 01:16:14,690
number of new medics.
Um,

1372
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:18,020
so as to restrict that a birth people 
billing,

1373
01:16:18,021 --> 01:16:18,854
but this is not much of a solution but 
you have large numbers of people try to 

1374
01:16:21,831 --> 01:16:23,900
find a family doctor.
I just successfully,

1375
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:25,693
okay so there is,
there is some meritocratic structure 

1376
01:16:28,831 --> 01:16:28,900
sure.

1377
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:29,733
To our society in so far as Iq 
conscientiousness and openness predict 

1378
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:34,713
longterm life success.
And that's a good thing because that's 

1379
01:16:36,611 --> 01:16:39,220
an indicator of of health and the 
society.

1380
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:44,250
I would say it's,
it's if your society is set up to,

1381
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:45,723
to,
to allow people who are intelligent and 

1382
01:16:48,431 --> 01:16:51,880
conscientious nearer the pinnacles of 
power structures,

1383
01:16:51,881 --> 01:16:52,714
that's a good thing for everyone.
Now you could still have an argument 

1384
01:16:54,851 --> 01:16:57,370
about how steep that gradient it should 
be.

1385
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:02,080
But then with regards to the,
to the guaranteed annual income issue,

1386
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:03,873
I'm also concerned that the importance 
of individual differences there are not 

1387
01:17:07,871 --> 01:17:09,710
being considered.
So for example,

1388
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:14,000
I don't know what people who are 
extremely low in conscientiousness would

1389
01:17:14,001 --> 01:17:18,080
do with an annual income because they're
not inclined to work.

1390
01:17:18,081 --> 01:17:18,914
And it isn't obvious to me that 
providing them with an easy way out is 

1391
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,070
the answer.
Because providing unconscientious people

1392
01:17:25,071 --> 01:17:28,010
with an easy way out seems to be 
actually quite counterproductive.

1393
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:29,870
And conscientiousness is a,
you know,

1394
01:17:29,871 --> 01:17:32,150
it's a decent predictor of longterm 
success.

1395
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:35,990
And we also don't know to what degree 
necessity is a motivator,

1396
01:17:35,991 --> 01:17:37,850
which is of course the conservative 
argument.

1397
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:39,980
So,
so,

1398
01:17:39,981 --> 01:17:40,814
and we also don't know how homogenous 
it's and small as society has to be 

1399
01:17:44,361 --> 01:17:47,900
before income redistribution programs 
will actually be successful.

1400
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:52,130
It seems easier to implement them in 
relatively homogenous societies like the

1401
01:17:52,131 --> 01:17:54,560
Scandinavian countries or the G or 
Japan,

1402
01:17:54,590 --> 01:17:58,520
which is where they tend to have been 
implemented with more success.

1403
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:01,310
So that's a con complicated phenomena as
well.

1404
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:02,773
And then the other thing that's really 
going to come up on his heart in the 

1405
01:18:05,421 --> 01:18:07,400
next 10 years,
I would say,

1406
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:08,683
this is how it looks to me,
is that I think computational devices 

1407
01:18:12,171 --> 01:18:15,500
are a multiplier of intelligence and 
conscientiousness.

1408
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:21,170
Because if you're smart and you know how
to use a computer and your diligence,

1409
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,033
so as conscientious person would be,
then you're much more deadly than you 

1410
01:18:26,391 --> 01:18:29,360
would be without your computer because 
it multiplies your,

1411
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:30,223
and there's a huge difference between 
someone who really knows how to use a 

1412
01:18:32,481 --> 01:18:34,490
computer,
including knowing how to program it.

1413
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:36,620
The someone who's,
you know,

1414
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:40,070
literate enough to use their ipad to,
to do a google search.

1415
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:43,550
And so I think one of the things that's 
also driving inequality,

1416
01:18:43,610 --> 01:18:45,980
particularly in societies like the 
United States,

1417
01:18:45,981 --> 01:18:46,814
is that increasingly people who are 
smart and conscientious can do a 

1418
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,910
tremendous amount of work without having
to hire anyone.

1419
01:18:53,660 --> 01:18:54,493
So we have these tiny companies that 
employ almost no one that gathered 

1420
01:18:57,611 --> 01:19:01,490
massive resources to themselves,
and that's going to be a problem.

1421
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:03,080
Well,
here's a good example.

1422
01:19:03,081 --> 01:19:05,540
Here's one of the thing that's coming.
So,

1423
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:06,374
you know,
the Tesla guys are working pretty hard 

1424
01:19:07,641 --> 01:19:08,474
on autonomous vehicles and then make it 
a lot of progress and they're not the 

1425
01:19:11,241 --> 01:19:12,380
only one.
So obviously,

1426
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:13,543
but you know,
the biggest employer for males in North 

1427
01:19:15,021 --> 01:19:18,560
America is as driver.
I didn't.

1428
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:19,780
Yeah,
yeah,

1429
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:20,613
yeah.
It's the biggest single employment 

1430
01:19:21,561 --> 01:19:23,030
category.
So,

1431
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,300
you know,
we're,

1432
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:25,250
we're,
we're,

1433
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,353
we're increasingly eradicating the 
possibility for people who are on the 

1434
01:19:30,231 --> 01:19:31,064
lower end of the intelligence 
distribution and the lower end of the 

1435
01:19:33,531 --> 01:19:38,030
conscientiousness distribution to find a
place in society.

1436
01:19:38,031 --> 01:19:39,860
And it's possible that providing them 
with,

1437
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:43,850
with minimal resources to survive might 
be sufficient to solve that problem.

1438
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,190
But I doubt it because as they say,
you know,

1439
01:19:46,191 --> 01:19:50,720
man does not live on bread alone.
And it seems to me that people need that

1440
01:19:50,721 --> 01:19:51,554
quest.
The degree to which people need to find 

1441
01:19:53,481 --> 01:19:54,314
a productive and credible place in a 
functional society is something that we 

1442
01:19:57,921 --> 01:20:00,650
haven't yet.
We don't know the parameters of that.

1443
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:01,993
They'll go,
I,

1444
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:03,760
I don't disagree.
I mean,

1445
01:20:03,761 --> 01:20:04,461
the,
the,

1446
01:20:04,461 --> 01:20:08,370
uh,
of course the loss of decently

1447
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:09,203
paid work of and two dates,
they beige or computer revolution to 

1448
01:20:14,451 --> 01:20:15,840
some extent,
or at least the,

1449
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:18,030
uh,
you know,

1450
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:22,950
modern electronic device and your phone 
could do everything revolution.

1451
01:20:23,310 --> 01:20:25,350
And you know,
I live in Hamilton,

1452
01:20:25,351 --> 01:20:26,184
Ontario,
where were former whale watch bucket 

1453
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:30,450
taub with,
uh,

1454
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:35,190
with an enormous number of people 
working in decently paid,

1455
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:39,060
working class jobs.
And those jobs,

1456
01:20:39,061 --> 01:20:39,894
but evaporating and pay.
If drivers evaporators work is going to 

1457
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:49,800
change work opportunities are going to 
change.

1458
01:20:49,801 --> 01:20:50,634
And I take your point that people need 
something that they can think of as 

1459
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:58,980
useful work.
Useful work.

1460
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:00,400
You know,
it's interesting we're talking,

1461
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:01,253
we're two males talking about this and 
we're probably thinking from a sub what 

1462
01:21:03,601 --> 01:21:04,434
bail perspective.
There's a lot of useful work that is 

1463
01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:11,610
minimally or not at all comp compensated
than a predominantly female don't maids,

1464
01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:14,250
um,
daycare kinds of things,

1465
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:16,950
various so called charitable activities 
and so on.

1466
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:19,530
And you know,
the,

1467
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:20,423
the idea that people need something to 
occupy their time with that feels 

1468
01:21:24,451 --> 01:21:25,284
worthwhile.
That editors have been twist social 

1469
01:21:26,701 --> 01:21:28,740
arena where they engage with other 
people,

1470
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:29,813
that they come home satisfied,
that they've done something useful and 

1471
01:21:32,131 --> 01:21:32,964
they also,
you don't have a chicken in every pot 

1472
01:21:34,891 --> 01:21:37,950
besides I need a work opportunities 
shrink.

1473
01:21:38,370 --> 01:21:42,190
And if the next mark Zuckerberg kind of 
play a hundred people to pull,

1474
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,030
um,
tens of billions of dollars,

1475
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:48,070
then where's that gonna come from?
Is,

1476
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:49,043
it may come from various sorts of unpaid
work with a guaranteed cub that you 

1477
01:21:55,450 --> 01:21:56,283
know,
enables that work to be paid and still 

1478
01:21:57,961 --> 01:21:59,760
be fulfilling?
I don't know.

1479
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,360
I don't know.
Well that's a good thing to think about.

1480
01:22:02,361 --> 01:22:03,050
I mean,
maybe,

1481
01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:03,883
maybe people will learn how to go out 
into the community and spontaneously do 

1482
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:08,714
useful things.
Although I can tell you that my 

1483
01:22:10,911 --> 01:22:13,570
experience trying to find gainful,
uh,

1484
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:14,503
let's call it volunteer employments for 
people who are on the lower end of the 

1485
01:22:17,661 --> 01:22:20,480
ability distribution has been 
absolutely,

1486
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:22,390
uh,
it's,

1487
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,233
it's difficult beyond imagination 
because it turns out that finding a 

1488
01:22:26,211 --> 01:22:29,120
volunteer position is actually no less 
difficult.

1489
01:22:29,121 --> 01:22:30,740
And finding a job,
for example,

1490
01:22:30,741 --> 01:22:31,574
you have to go through a relatively 
complicated process of police screening 

1491
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:35,413
for most jobs and you have to produce a 
resume and you have to be able to work 

1492
01:22:37,881 --> 01:22:38,714
in an office environment and you know,
you need to have all the abilities that 

1493
01:22:41,541 --> 01:22:44,480
you would have if you were actually 
having a real job.

1494
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:47,930
And so that,
that makes things complicated as well.

1495
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:49,470
So,
yeah.

1496
01:22:49,471 --> 01:22:50,304
No,
I want to come back also to what you 

1497
01:22:51,301 --> 01:22:56,190
were saying about the predictive power 
of Iq and conscientiousness,

1498
01:22:56,191 --> 01:22:59,280
which I don't dispute.
And I'm also not one of these people who

1499
01:22:59,281 --> 01:23:03,150
suffers that the delusion that these 
things are totally open quotes,

1500
01:23:03,151 --> 01:23:04,980
socially determined,
close quotes.

1501
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:05,823
I mean I understand and believe that 
they have high heritability at 

1502
01:23:09,131 --> 01:23:13,570
identifiable genetic sources in that 
variability and so on.

1503
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:16,240
But you know,
the standard old joke used to be,

1504
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:19,070
you can tell me because you know more 
about personality psychology that I do,

1505
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,970
the standard old junk used to be that 
everything's 50% heritable.

1506
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:23,123
That uh,
that,

1507
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:24,173
that pretty much anything that you could
measure as a trait that has any 

1508
01:23:27,011 --> 01:23:27,844
stability within the lifetime also turns
out to have a heritability somewhere to 

1509
01:23:30,851 --> 01:23:35,851
your 0.5.
But there's the other 0.5 of,

1510
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,233
you know,
some people have low iqs because they 

1511
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:42,910
were exposed to two buck chuck 
[inaudible].

1512
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:44,710
Um,
you know,

1513
01:23:44,711 --> 01:23:48,140
um,
I believe that conscientiousness,

1514
01:23:48,150 --> 01:23:50,220
this can probably be,
um,

1515
01:23:50,930 --> 01:23:51,763
like I believe you suggested earlier 
that we know something about this 

1516
01:23:54,311 --> 01:23:56,840
already about developmental determinants
of swell,

1517
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,460
of shifts in conscientiousness.
And,

1518
01:24:00,461 --> 01:24:01,630
uh,
so,

1519
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:02,943
you know,
we have to caution ourselves against 

1520
01:24:04,451 --> 01:24:05,284
talking about these individual 
difference factors as if they are a 

1521
01:24:08,191 --> 01:24:09,024
beautiful attributes of individuals that
are going to undermine any sort of 

1522
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:18,170
progressive improvement of,
of that just for people who are,

1523
01:24:18,171 --> 01:24:18,601
are,
are,

1524
01:24:18,601 --> 01:24:19,340
are,
are,

1525
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:24,340
are going to create bad byproducts of 
attempts to produce social justice.

1526
01:24:25,091 --> 01:24:27,020
It's just going to,
you're going to leave here,

1527
01:24:27,290 --> 01:24:31,030
you're dumb and Kanchi it just people 
out there being parasites or something.

1528
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:32,020
Well,
you know,

1529
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:33,190
um,
there,

1530
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:38,260
there is of course decent evidence that 
their socio cultural effects on Iq,

1531
01:24:39,051 --> 01:24:39,884
I mean the flynn effect,
which is named after the man who 

1532
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:45,320
described the,
the,

1533
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:46,173
the,
the phenomenon indicates that the 

1534
01:24:48,201 --> 01:24:49,034
average Iq has been increasing quite 
substantially over the last hundred 

1535
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:54,140
years.
And the reason for that,

1536
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:58,400
no one knows for sure.
But one of the putative reasons for that

1537
01:24:58,401 --> 01:25:02,330
is that we've lifted the bottom out of 
catastrophe.

1538
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:05,780
So there aren't people whose iqs are 
stunted by,

1539
01:25:06,110 --> 01:25:06,943
by exposure to zero information during 
critical developmental periods and who 

1540
01:25:11,451 --> 01:25:12,650
didn't get enough to eat.

1541
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:14,013
Yeah.
Cause I was gonna say Superior Bell 

1542
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:16,510
Nutrition.
Everybody there a probation.

1543
01:25:16,511 --> 01:25:16,930
Yeah,

1544
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:17,591
yeah,
exactly.

1545
01:25:17,591 --> 01:25:18,520
Exactly.
So we've,

1546
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:19,533
we've wiped out in many ways,
we've wiped out the worst effects of 

1547
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:26,560
privation and that's increasingly true 
as well.

1548
01:25:26,561 --> 01:25:31,360
On,
on the worldwide scale worldwide stage.

1549
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,390
You know,
there's about 150,000 people a day right

1550
01:25:34,391 --> 01:25:38,020
now being lifted out of absolute poverty
by UN standards,

1551
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:38,913
the fastest improvement in the history 
of the world by a huge margin and also 

1552
01:25:41,861 --> 01:25:45,610
about 300,000 people a day being hooked 
up to the electrical grid.

1553
01:25:45,970 --> 01:25:50,800
So we are making some progress,
removing the absolute privation problem,

1554
01:25:50,801 --> 01:25:55,060
which is a nontrivial problem.
The problem with most of the attempts to

1555
01:25:55,061 --> 01:25:58,840
raise Iq is that they don't change the 
variance in Iq.

1556
01:25:58,841 --> 01:25:59,674
They tend to raise the average Iq across
the population and that leaves the 

1557
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:06,680
inequality I Iq inequality problem,
basically untouched.

1558
01:26:06,681 --> 01:26:11,681
So there have been studies trying to 
estimate how much socioeconomic,

1559
01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:13,100
um,
pressure,

1560
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:18,101
let's say you have to place on an 
individual to raise their iq lowering.

1561
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:19,660
It's easy,
right?

1562
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:23,150
Because making something worse is always
easier than making something better.

1563
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:26,660
But if I remember correctly,
if you take a,

1564
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:27,643
an identical twin who's adopted out at 
birth in order to produce a 15 point 

1565
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,610
increase in Iq compared to the other 
twin,

1566
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:36,313
which is a one standard deviation 
increase and about the same as the 

1567
01:26:38,661 --> 01:26:42,400
average difference between a university 
student in,

1568
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:45,410
in an average state college and an 
average high school student,

1569
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:50,710
you have to move the one twin from the 
fifth percentile of socioeconomic status

1570
01:26:51,231 --> 01:26:52,064
to the 95th percentile.
So you need about a three standard 

1571
01:26:55,101 --> 01:26:55,934
deviation improvement and socioeconomic 
conditions to produce a one standard 

1572
01:26:59,481 --> 01:27:03,320
deviation improvement in Iq.
So it looks like it can be done,

1573
01:27:03,321 --> 01:27:05,210
but it's,
but it's expensive,

1574
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:06,523
you know,
and

1575
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:07,870
I see,
I see what you're saying.

1576
01:27:07,871 --> 01:27:11,590
I'm kind of surprised
actually.

1577
01:27:11,591 --> 01:27:12,424
I mean,
given,

1578
01:27:12,430 --> 01:27:13,263
you know,
we just mentioned bell nutrition as one 

1579
01:27:14,471 --> 01:27:17,830
possible source of low Iq one possible 
developmental source.

1580
01:27:17,831 --> 01:27:19,390
I'm kind of surprised that,
uh,

1581
01:27:19,690 --> 01:27:22,720
to the degree that the flynn effect 
might be due to things like,

1582
01:27:22,721 --> 01:27:25,720
or reduction of the number of people 
exposed to severe malnutrition,

1583
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:30,520
that wouldn't have also simultaneously 
truncated the variance a little bit.

1584
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,460
Um,
that seems like they said,

1585
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,300
sorry,
let me restate that.

1586
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:38,270
It has truncated,
it has truncated the variance,

1587
01:27:38,271 --> 01:27:41,630
although the data on that isn't clear 
isn't as clear.

1588
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:42,943
So,
but,

1589
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:43,833
but I,
I do believe that it's a reasonable 

1590
01:27:45,051 --> 01:27:47,030
inference to make that the variance has 
been truncated.

1591
01:27:47,031 --> 01:27:47,864
It's also hidden to some degree because 
the Iq tests are always renew warm to 

1592
01:27:51,021 --> 01:27:53,430
keep the variance set of standard 15 
points.

1593
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,170
Yeah.
So,

1594
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:55,003
so it makes it difficult to look 
retrospectively and see what's happened 

1595
01:27:58,191 --> 01:27:59,930
to the variance.
So,

1596
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:01,153
but,
uh,

1597
01:28:01,490 --> 01:28:03,020
the other problem too is that,
you know,

1598
01:28:03,021 --> 01:28:03,854
you get these stories now and then about
these companies that come out with the 

1599
01:28:05,921 --> 01:28:06,754
claims that their brain exercises can 
improve Iq in the literature on that is 

1600
01:28:10,221 --> 01:28:11,054
damn dismal.
I can tell you it's that the holy grail 

1601
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:14,354
is to produce cognitive exercises that 
produce a legitimate impact on fluid 

1602
01:28:17,961 --> 01:28:19,670
intelligence.
And like,

1603
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:21,470
there has been a lot of work down on 
that.

1604
01:28:21,471 --> 01:28:24,410
And the answer is so far is that it 
doesn't work.

1605
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:27,330
So what about the game?
What about the video gaming?

1606
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:28,183
I mean,
I know there has been a suggestion that 

1607
01:28:29,411 --> 01:28:34,000
playing video games actually improves at
least sub aspects of intelligence.

1608
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:37,270
There's a couple of studies that 
indicated that video games might improve

1609
01:28:37,271 --> 01:28:38,580
spatial intelligence,
but

1610
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:41,320
problem,
and I think this is,

1611
01:28:41,350 --> 01:28:42,183
this is a critical problem or apps,
an insoluble one or at least no one's 

1612
01:28:45,841 --> 01:28:48,230
solved it,
is that what you get is that if you,

1613
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:51,670
if you exercise yourself substantially 
on a given game,

1614
01:28:51,671 --> 01:28:54,190
you can radically accelerate your 
performance in the game.

1615
01:28:54,370 --> 01:28:57,040
So you can get much better at those 
specific skill share.

1616
01:28:57,041 --> 01:29:00,370
But you don't get generalization across 
cognitive sets,

1617
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:02,610
which is what really hoping for because 
I thought,

1618
01:29:02,611 --> 01:29:04,230
I thought that was the claim from 
somebody.

1619
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:07,530
They have shown some increases in 
spatial Iq,

1620
01:29:07,531 --> 01:29:08,364
but there's not very many studies.
And I would say they're far over 

1621
01:29:11,211 --> 01:29:14,760
balanced by the other side of the 
research equation,

1622
01:29:14,761 --> 01:29:15,594
which continually says,
and I've looked at this because I'm 

1623
01:29:17,851 --> 01:29:20,730
really interested in the improvement of 
Iq.

1624
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:23,160
I mean that's,
that's the holy grail in some sense.

1625
01:29:23,161 --> 01:29:24,480
And that,
and,

1626
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:25,373
and,
uh,

1627
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:27,170
the,
the,

1628
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:28,213
the overwhelming preponderance of 
evidence suggests that you don't get 

1629
01:29:31,141 --> 01:29:33,660
generalization outside the narrow 
domain.

1630
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:35,940
Now why that is,
and even this,

1631
01:29:35,941 --> 01:29:36,830
it's even worse,
hey,

1632
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:37,830
because you might say,
well,

1633
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:39,113
imagine that you could take five 
different domains of intelligence still 

1634
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:43,193
associated type with the g and you had 
people practice routines in all five 

1635
01:29:48,241 --> 01:29:49,074
dimensions.
Maybe you'd get generalization under 

1636
01:29:50,941 --> 01:29:53,010
those circumstances.
And the,

1637
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:53,933
the,
the results of the research attempting 

1638
01:29:55,801 --> 01:29:56,634
that indicate that no,
as soon as you move away from those 

1639
01:29:58,411 --> 01:30:01,680
specific practice instances,
you don't get generalization.

1640
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:02,940
So,
I mean,

1641
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:05,300
I guess it's,
I guess the subways,

1642
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:06,613
some of this is to be expected from the 
consideration that everything is an 

1643
01:30:09,171 --> 01:30:13,100
allocation problem with it within the 
body at Brae in,

1644
01:30:13,101 --> 01:30:13,934
uh,
um,

1645
01:30:14,210 --> 01:30:15,200
that,
you know,

1646
01:30:15,201 --> 01:30:16,034
by a large,
an approvement blood domain tends to be 

1647
01:30:20,721 --> 01:30:24,790
bought at the expense of something else.
Yeah,

1648
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:26,803
just that.

1649
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:29,240
Right.
And then conscientiousness,

1650
01:30:29,270 --> 01:30:31,670
I can tell you some research we've done.
That's cool.

1651
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:32,773
Although we haven't been able to 
demonstrate that it's actually improved 

1652
01:30:34,911 --> 01:30:35,744
conscientiousness,
the first thing to note about 

1653
01:30:37,251 --> 01:30:39,860
conscientiousness is that no one 
understands it at all.

1654
01:30:40,370 --> 01:30:44,750
Especially the industriousness element.
There's no plausible biological,

1655
01:30:44,751 --> 01:30:49,370
psychological neurophysiological or 
animal models for conscientiousness.

1656
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:50,683
All we've got is self reports.
We can't even find tasks that 

1657
01:30:53,061 --> 01:30:56,300
conscientious people do better.
It's unbelievable.

1658
01:30:56,900 --> 01:31:00,330
But I'm self reports really.
Also freeport,

1659
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:03,200
well you can get reports from teachers 
and parents and so forth,

1660
01:31:03,201 --> 01:31:05,040
but it's all human report.
Okay.

1661
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:06,053
The only way we can measure it,
and we know like in my lab we probably 

1662
01:31:08,421 --> 01:31:12,050
tried 200 tasks trying to find something
that conscientiousness,

1663
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,570
conscientious people do better.
No luck.

1664
01:31:15,320 --> 01:31:16,153
We can derive it from linguistic 
analysis of verbal output now to some 

1665
01:31:18,771 --> 01:31:20,480
degree.
But that's still,

1666
01:31:20,481 --> 01:31:21,890
that's not a task,
you know.

1667
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:24,700
Yeah.
So now we,

1668
01:31:24,701 --> 01:31:25,534
we produced a series of programs called 
the self authoring suite and one of 

1669
01:31:28,821 --> 01:31:29,654
them,
the future authoring program to writing 

1670
01:31:31,341 --> 01:31:36,140
program that helps people lay out their 
plans for the future in,

1671
01:31:36,141 --> 01:31:38,330
in detail.
So they have to consider their,

1672
01:31:38,331 --> 01:31:41,930
um,
their intimate relationships,

1673
01:31:41,931 --> 01:31:44,000
their career goals,
their educational goals,

1674
01:31:44,001 --> 01:31:44,834
their use of time outside work,
their plans to maintain mental and 

1675
01:31:47,181 --> 01:31:49,670
physical health,
their use of drugs and alcohol.

1676
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:53,570
They have to write for 15 minutes about 
what kind of life they'd like to have if

1677
01:31:53,571 --> 01:31:56,870
they were taking care of themselves 
three to five years in the future.

1678
01:31:57,170 --> 01:31:59,060
And then to write for the same amount of
time,

1679
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:03,070
how terrible their life could be if all 
their bad habits took control.

1680
01:32:03,630 --> 01:32:07,060
And then they have to turn the positive 
vision into an implementable plan.

1681
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:11,860
And we've managed to improve their 
college grades by about 20% and drop out

1682
01:32:11,861 --> 01:32:12,370
there,
drop,

1683
01:32:12,370 --> 01:32:17,200
drop their dropout rate by about 25% 
over about 10,000 students now.

1684
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:18,363
But you know,
we tried to see if that was mediated by 

1685
01:32:20,261 --> 01:32:23,320
an improvement and conscientiousness and
there was no evidence for that.

1686
01:32:23,950 --> 01:32:28,950
What it was mediated by was number of 
words written during the exercise.

1687
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:32,740
So it turns out that thinking more about
your future helps,

1688
01:32:32,890 --> 01:32:34,600
the more you think about it,
the more it helps.

1689
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:36,120
And maybe that,
you know,

1690
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:36,963
maybe that would translate into an 
improvement in conscientiousness across 

1691
01:32:39,251 --> 01:32:40,084
time.
But,

1692
01:32:40,370 --> 01:32:41,203
um,
there haven't been any credible studies 

1693
01:32:43,511 --> 01:32:44,344
that I know of indicating that there are
exercises that can be done to improve 

1694
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:50,500
conscientiousness.
So that's also,

1695
01:32:50,950 --> 01:32:51,783
you know,
troublesome and worrisome because that 

1696
01:32:53,741 --> 01:32:55,300
would be a nice thing to be able to do.

1697
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:58,990
Yeah.
I mean I haven't thought much about it.

1698
01:32:58,991 --> 01:32:59,824
They don't know much about the 
literature on conscientiousness as a 

1699
01:33:01,771 --> 01:33:02,604
trait,
but the word seems to connote to me as 

1700
01:33:05,221 --> 01:33:09,060
an ordinary English speaker has a strong
social element to it as well.

1701
01:33:09,061 --> 01:33:09,894
It's kind of like a conscientious person
is somebody who doesn't forget his 

1702
01:33:12,901 --> 01:33:14,290
obligations.
Um,

1703
01:33:14,610 --> 01:33:18,210
your index of conscientiousness and a 
university professor is,

1704
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:19,393
you know,
somebody has asked you to write them a 

1705
01:33:21,241 --> 01:33:24,120
reference letter for getting into 
graduate school or whatever.

1706
01:33:24,290 --> 01:33:26,480
Do you actually prioritize getting the 
DAB thing done?

1707
01:33:26,481 --> 01:33:29,520
I'd Tibor is there some risks that 
you'll just forget about it and shove it

1708
01:33:29,521 --> 01:33:33,240
to them somewhere else?
I imagine cut,

1709
01:33:33,241 --> 01:33:34,074
she had just,
this is having a strong element of 

1710
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:36,833
attentiveness to social obligation and 
to the wellbeing of others as it is 

1711
01:33:41,281 --> 01:33:43,920
defined and the personality of the 
literature doesn't have any of that.

1712
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:44,580
Well,
I would,

1713
01:33:44,580 --> 01:33:45,413
I would say not so much attention to the
wellbeing of others because that's more 

1714
01:33:47,981 --> 01:33:50,800
trait agreeableness,
that's more than maternal dimension.

1715
01:33:50,801 --> 01:33:54,970
But there's definitely a massive effect 
of social obligation,

1716
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:56,103
which is part of the reason why 
conservatives tend to be hired 

1717
01:33:58,721 --> 01:34:02,260
conscientiousness than liberals,
but it's not well being of others.

1718
01:34:02,261 --> 01:34:05,370
It's duty.
And so the,

1719
01:34:05,371 --> 01:34:06,204
the,
the conscientious types may form and 

1720
01:34:08,321 --> 01:34:11,010
maintain social contracts.
Yes,

1721
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:12,123
they implement their plans and they seem
to feel shame and self contempt when 

1722
01:34:17,561 --> 01:34:18,394
they,
when they fail to live up to their 

1723
01:34:19,721 --> 01:34:20,554
social obligations.
And so that's another thing that's 

1724
01:34:22,211 --> 01:34:23,044
interesting about the income 
redistribution idea because it's 

1725
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:26,374
conceivable to me that conscientious 
people would hate that because 

1726
01:34:30,370 --> 01:34:32,710
conscientious people do very badly,
for example,

1727
01:34:32,711 --> 01:34:33,370
if they're,
um,

1728
01:34:33,370 --> 01:34:36,160
if they're laid off from work,
even if it's not their fault,

1729
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:39,010
they still take themselves apart for 
their failure.

1730
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:40,553
So,
and so conscientious people in 

1731
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,840
particular seem to find inactivity 
without productivity,

1732
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:50,830
highly aversive and adverse,
if enough to really cause them,

1733
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:52,510
you know,
major health problems.

1734
01:34:52,990 --> 01:34:54,500
So well,

1735
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:55,833
could,
that brings us back to what we were 

1736
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:58,970
discussing a little while ago.
The problem of

1737
01:35:02,410 --> 01:35:03,243
ensuring that large numbers people have 
access to bd goofball work in an age at 

1738
01:35:08,771 --> 01:35:11,050
which it is more and more the case that 
uh,

1739
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:16,170
that big components of the economy are 
blue bag away with very few employees.

1740
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:21,850
I that's going to continue.
That's probably going to escalate

1741
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:25,720
or back to that same topic to some 
extent.

1742
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:28,000
Yes.
But again,

1743
01:35:28,001 --> 01:35:28,834
I,
I mean I think,

1744
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:30,093
I think any inequality of opportunity is
sort of they bought of our bedrock of 

1745
01:35:36,721 --> 01:35:38,170
any quality.
Yeah.

1746
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:41,310
Having its impact upon us.
It's,

1747
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:43,500
it's,
it's certainly the bond but bedrock of,

1748
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:47,800
of why we should care about it.
Odd,

1749
01:35:47,801 --> 01:35:50,620
moral and social justice grouts it's 
like,

1750
01:35:50,621 --> 01:35:53,410
well why should people who,

1751
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:55,320
okay,

1752
01:35:55,320 --> 01:36:00,010
why should bloods birthright affect the 
opportunity is available to what and

1753
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:01,843
well,
it's also a social catastrophe because 

1754
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:04,603
hypothetically you want to set up a 
society so that whatever someone has to 

1755
01:36:08,691 --> 01:36:09,524
offer is maximally offerable to the 
community because otherwise the 

1756
01:36:13,341 --> 01:36:15,110
community loses.
Yes.

1757
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:15,951
Now,
it seems to be,

1758
01:36:15,951 --> 01:36:16,784
I mean,
I think one of the great examples of 

1759
01:36:18,081 --> 01:36:19,880
that,
although I don't think this accounts for

1760
01:36:19,881 --> 01:36:20,714
all of it,
is that the relationship between the 

1761
01:36:22,311 --> 01:36:23,144
provision of women's rights by countries
and their economic productivity is 

1762
01:36:26,031 --> 01:36:26,864
staggeringly high.
So I think that also has to do with o 

1763
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:34,550
openness in general to transformation 
and change with,

1764
01:36:34,610 --> 01:36:35,443
with,
with the provision of women's rights 

1765
01:36:36,621 --> 01:36:38,750
being an index of that.
But nonetheless,

1766
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,870
it's a great predictor of eventual 
economic success.

1767
01:36:42,170 --> 01:36:43,020
Well,
so our park,

1768
01:36:43,110 --> 01:36:43,943
we get a ducks and partly perhaps bar 
more direct effect that after all it 

1769
01:36:47,500 --> 01:36:50,140
slightly over half the population,
um,

1770
01:36:50,590 --> 01:36:54,220
maybe their talents are better utilized.

1771
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:56,533
Right.
Well that's certainly what we would 

1772
01:36:57,311 --> 01:36:58,480
hope.
And I think,

1773
01:36:58,690 --> 01:36:59,523
I think as you said,
I think the evidence at least suggests 

1774
01:37:01,481 --> 01:37:02,350
that.
Yeah.

1775
01:37:02,410 --> 01:37:02,861
So,
okay,

1776
01:37:02,861 --> 01:37:06,790
so let me recapitulate because we should
probably fold this up.

1777
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,350
It's so,
so as far as I'm concerned,

1778
01:37:11,351 --> 01:37:12,184
your work was revolutionary because it 
undermined the general proposition that 

1779
01:37:16,151 --> 01:37:20,410
the fundamental cause of crime and 
violent crime in particular was poverty.

1780
01:37:20,950 --> 01:37:22,840
Instead you,
you flipped it,

1781
01:37:23,070 --> 01:37:24,910
you flipped it on edge,
so to speak.

1782
01:37:24,911 --> 01:37:28,540
And made the,
made the claim well substantiated by the

1783
01:37:28,541 --> 01:37:29,374
research that it's relative poverty that
drives violent crime because of status 

1784
01:37:34,661 --> 01:37:38,600
seeking primarily among young men and 
older.

1785
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:42,760
There are effects of absolute privation 
and that would be the poverty.

1786
01:37:42,761 --> 01:37:43,594
It's the,
the effects of relative deprivation of 

1787
01:37:47,081 --> 01:37:49,720
status are much more,
let's say,

1788
01:37:50,050 --> 01:37:52,930
especially in our societies,
much more socially significant.

1789
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:54,153
Yes.
And up the status competition is driven 

1790
01:37:55,861 --> 01:38:00,210
at least in part by the desire of men to
attain status,

1791
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:04,320
to obtain access to,
to women roughly speaking.

1792
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:05,183
And it's partly because women outsourced
the problem of mate selection to the 

1793
01:38:09,031 --> 01:38:10,950
male competition domain.
Right.

1794
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:13,230
So the males compete,
the women peel off the top.

1795
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:15,450
It's like a market solution in some 
sense.

1796
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:17,373
And then,
and then having pointed out that 

1797
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:25,230
inequality not only drives male homicide
but also tends to destabilize societies.

1798
01:38:25,770 --> 01:38:30,770
There is an impetus for people to 
consider how we can stop the winner from

1799
01:38:31,141 --> 01:38:35,160
taking all without becoming unduly or 
authoritarian about it or,

1800
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:38,580
or,
or impeding individual productivity.

1801
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:42,170
Given the fact that there is individual 
variation in yes,

1802
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:45,090
in the elements that actually produce 
productivity.

1803
01:38:45,091 --> 01:38:49,380
That's our set of social problems,
exacerbated by the fact that we're going

1804
01:38:49,381 --> 01:38:51,870
to be wiping out employment for huge 
categories,

1805
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:55,740
particularly of men over the next 15 
years.

1806
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:57,080
Yeah.
Let me,

1807
01:38:57,081 --> 01:38:58,580
uh,
in this context,

1808
01:38:59,090 --> 01:38:59,923
just make a point that I spent most of a
chapter of my book on and that is that 

1809
01:39:04,430 --> 01:39:08,190
the notion that inequality is somehow,
um,

1810
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,193
the engine of productivity.
It's been pretty much rejected by 

1811
01:39:13,820 --> 01:39:14,653
economists themselves in recent years.
I've come to the conclusion that 

1812
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:18,493
relatively equitable places actually 
have more of economic productivity in 

1813
01:39:23,871 --> 01:39:26,690
the ensuing period of time than those 
that start out boring,

1814
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:29,000
inequitable.
And there's a lot of reasons for that.

1815
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:31,350
Um,
the one that I think is most striking to

1816
01:39:31,351 --> 01:39:36,351
you that I would commend people to look 
into is the concept of useless,

1817
01:39:36,891 --> 01:39:37,724
if you like,
are wasteful expenditure on guard wave 

1818
01:39:39,711 --> 01:39:40,544
or relatively on equal societies.
A guard waiver is a term coined by 

1819
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:44,843
economists samples and Arjun Jayadev.
And what they've shown is that the 

1820
01:39:49,041 --> 01:39:53,090
number of people who are employed just 
jobs like being security guards,

1821
01:39:53,380 --> 01:39:55,400
um,
goes up as it equality goes up.

1822
01:39:55,401 --> 01:39:57,290
It's no great surprise when you think 
about it,

1823
01:39:57,590 --> 01:40:00,920
but you could defy guard labor bar 
broadly or more narrowly.

1824
01:40:00,921 --> 01:40:05,540
And the general result is that a large 
proportion of people are engaged at work

1825
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:06,374
then is it a sense nod productive?
It's just trying to prevent people from 

1826
01:40:08,841 --> 01:40:09,674
usurping the property of other people 
and that this is a very wasteful 

1827
01:40:14,331 --> 01:40:15,164
consequences of extreme inequality and 
economic waste that's reduced to 

1828
01:40:19,341 --> 01:40:22,370
relatively equitable societies.
And there are others.

1829
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:24,573
As the

1830
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:25,553
society becomes more unequal,
it tilts towards authoritarianism at 

1831
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:29,970
multiple levels.

1832
01:40:30,220 --> 01:40:32,380
Organization,
it's one that just,

1833
01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:33,963
sorry,
I was just going to say add towards 

1834
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:38,350
exactly this and it's counterproductive 
even from the point of view of,

1835
01:40:38,351 --> 01:40:40,540
of simple,
you know,

1836
01:40:40,541 --> 01:40:42,580
economic criteria,
GDP,

1837
01:40:42,581 --> 01:40:44,170
it so odd that,
uh,

1838
01:40:44,530 --> 01:40:45,363
that inequality gets in the way that for
a bunch of reasons and other really 

1839
01:40:48,191 --> 01:40:50,770
interesting when the ball's has,
um,

1840
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:56,340
has articulated it in a book.
Paul's b o w l e s sat bowls to people I

1841
01:40:56,641 --> 01:40:57,950
don't look about.
Um,

1842
01:40:58,390 --> 01:40:59,223
I think that's book was called the new 
politics of any quality of 

1843
01:41:02,651 --> 01:41:04,420
redistribution to that.
I liked it a lot.

1844
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:07,600
Anyway.
One thing that he's shown that I thought

1845
01:41:07,601 --> 01:41:08,434
was very interesting and it never 
entered my head before I read was that 

1846
01:41:12,010 --> 01:41:17,010
the actual quality of goods it is 
society can be damaged by severity,

1847
01:41:17,051 --> 01:41:18,310
quality.
When

1848
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:20,883
rich individuals,
which firms have the capacity to keep 

1849
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:29,520
innovators and small companies from 
establishing themselves.

1850
01:41:29,531 --> 01:41:30,364
You mentioned before about the 
differences and entrepreneurial 

1851
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:33,873
undertakings and where large numbers of 
people with worthy small business plans 

1852
01:41:39,251 --> 01:41:42,130
can't capitalize them properly.
It can't get off the ground.

1853
01:41:42,131 --> 01:41:42,964
You've actually got a phenomenon of 
people with lots of wealth and shoddy 

1854
01:41:47,471 --> 01:41:48,304
products can drive people with better 
quality products who are trying to get 

1855
01:41:51,311 --> 01:41:52,144
started at the bottom out of the bar 
camp with negative results for just the 

1856
01:41:56,351 --> 01:41:57,184
consumer.

1857
01:41:57,510 --> 01:41:58,343
Well,
the society having people stack up at 

1858
01:41:59,941 --> 01:42:00,774
zero zero turns out to be a very,
very difficult place to get out of 

1859
01:42:04,130 --> 01:42:06,420
because you can't leverage yourself out 
of it.

1860
01:42:06,790 --> 01:42:07,623
And what's also in those really unequal 
societies to like say Central American 

1861
01:42:10,801 --> 01:42:11,634
societies,
it's also becomes increasingly 

1862
01:42:13,261 --> 01:42:14,094
unpleasant for the people who are 
wealthy because they're only wealthy in 

1863
01:42:16,201 --> 01:42:20,010
a very narrowly defined way because they
can't go outside.

1864
01:42:20,130 --> 01:42:20,963
They can't let their children go out on 
into public because they'll get 

1865
01:42:23,761 --> 01:42:24,690
kidnapped.
I mean,

1866
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:28,820
the societies get pretty ugly when the 
fences have to be really high and yes,

1867
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,210
and,
and so,

1868
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:33,000
so
yeah.

1869
01:42:33,150 --> 01:42:35,860
Wow.
So the rich countries,

1870
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:39,270
rich countries of the world,
those problems are not absent.

1871
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:40,133
I mean there are certainly worse than 
the u s than they are in Canada or most 

1872
01:42:42,571 --> 01:42:43,404
of western Europe.

1873
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:47,050
Yeah.
Well,

1874
01:42:47,051 --> 01:42:48,460
all right.
That was really good.

1875
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:52,510
I'm very happy that you agreed to do a 
podcast with Ben and I mean,

1876
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:54,340
I found your work well.
I'm,

1877
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:55,323
I definitely regard you as one of the 
people who's been highly influential on 

1878
01:42:59,081 --> 01:42:59,950
my thinking.
I mean,

1879
01:42:59,951 --> 01:43:02,140
I think that work on relative poverty is
just,

1880
01:43:02,660 --> 01:43:05,560
and the effect sizes,
the work you guys did in Chicago,

1881
01:43:06,130 --> 01:43:10,780
your work on indicating the adaptive 
utility of,

1882
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:14,070
of uncertainty related dominous 
challenges in,

1883
01:43:14,071 --> 01:43:14,904
in unequal societies.
All of that's brilliant I think can 

1884
01:43:17,170 --> 01:43:18,003
nicely biologically predicated in the 
science has done extremely soundly and 

1885
01:43:21,251 --> 01:43:24,310
it has remarkable policy implications 
and you know,

1886
01:43:24,311 --> 01:43:27,610
and it changes the view around crime 
and,

1887
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:28,773
and,
and wealth and in a very important way 

1888
01:43:30,671 --> 01:43:32,950
to tilt it over towards the inequality 
side.

1889
01:43:32,951 --> 01:43:33,784
I think it's,
and it fits so nicely in with the 

1890
01:43:35,591 --> 01:43:37,450
dominance hierarchy,
literature and all of that.

1891
01:43:37,451 --> 01:43:39,790
It's,
it's really profound stuff as far as I'm

1892
01:43:39,791 --> 01:43:40,624
concerned.
So I'm really glad you had a chance to 

1893
01:43:42,281 --> 01:43:43,330
share it with everyone.

1894
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:47,250
Thank you very much.
I appreciate those kind words.

1895
01:43:47,251 --> 01:43:49,950
You can,
flattery will get you everywhere.

1896
01:43:50,990 --> 01:43:52,040
Yeah.
Well the thing is,

1897
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:55,340
the best kind of flattery is truth.
So,

1898
01:43:55,490 --> 01:43:56,323
and uh,
I would certainly recommend that people 

1899
01:43:58,071 --> 01:43:58,904
take a look at your book if they're 
interested in what we've been 

1900
01:44:00,801 --> 01:44:01,790
discussing.
Again,

1901
01:44:01,791 --> 01:44:04,070
that's killing the competition,
which is,

1902
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:05,690
it's very readable,
I would say.

1903
01:44:05,691 --> 01:44:09,230
It provides a lovely argument with 
regards to inequality,

1904
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:13,050
addresses the major criticisms,
I think very effectively and,

1905
01:44:13,051 --> 01:44:13,884
and starts to lay out what is going to 
be an increasingly necessary public 

1906
01:44:17,181 --> 01:44:20,840
discussion about how civilized societies
can,

1907
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:24,500
can,
can ensure that they don't collapse into

1908
01:44:24,501 --> 01:44:27,450
two extreme distribution,
um,

1909
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:28,653
uh,
w into two extreme distributions of 

1910
01:44:31,011 --> 01:44:33,080
wealth or other resources.
It's a real danger.

1911
01:44:33,081 --> 01:44:34,370
It's a conscious,
unconscious,

1912
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:35,413
constant danger.
It needs to be thought through and 

1913
01:44:36,951 --> 01:44:40,450
addressed very intelligently.
So thanks again.

1914
01:44:40,490 --> 01:44:42,320
Hopefully,
maybe we'll get another chance to talk,

1915
01:44:42,321 --> 01:44:44,510
hopefully a couple of hundred thousand 
people to watch this.

1916
01:44:44,511 --> 01:44:46,080
That will be good.
That'll okay.

1917
01:44:46,081 --> 01:44:47,480
Great.
Thanks a lot.

1918
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:50,660
You Bet.
[inaudible] signing off.

1919
01:44:50,970 --> 01:44:51,803
Okay.
