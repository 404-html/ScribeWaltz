1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,733
I don't know.
You've probably come across this little 

2
00:00:02,701 --> 00:00:05,430
diagram in the book and it's quite a 
complicated diagram,

3
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:06,264
so I'm going to just walk you through it
a bit and then he'll tell you the 

4
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:12,930
Egyptian story.
So this is,

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,700
this is a sequence of interconnected 
causal loop.

6
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:18,780
So the question might be,
well,

7
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:20,730
how does morality emerged from the 
bottom?

8
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:21,630
And I would say,
well,

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,493
especially the morality that's 
associated with assuming that attention 

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,020
is something that's sacred,
roughly speaking.

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,670
Okay,
so managing,

12
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:31,710
you'll see someone reading engaged in 
something,

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:32,911
you might think,
oh,

14
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:35,850
I'd really like to be engaged like that,
which is what you would think,

15
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:37,410
right?
Because everyone wants that.

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,970
It's like,
I'd like to be engaged.

17
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:40,200
Okay,
so then you might think,

18
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,183
well,
this person looks like they're fully 

19
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:45,330
alive.
Something like that.

20
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:47,820
They're not being obsessed by 
catastrophes and all that.

21
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:48,810
They're into what they're doing.

22
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,300
What's that like?
Okay.

23
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,051
You'd say,
well,

24
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,300
that's associated with creative 
exploration.

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,040
And then you might say,
well,

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,293
why is creative exploration useful in 
the answer to that is because it can 

27
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:03,600
generate adaptive behavior of all sorts.
Okay,

28
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:04,434
so then what?
Well then you can imitate the adaptive 

29
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:09,720
behavior because we can use our bodies 
as representational devices.

30
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:12,600
So we act out the person who's 
interested in something.

31
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,560
So that's actually in large part why 
people like to buy art,

32
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,440
you know?
So lots of people I've seen by arc,

33
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,573
they liked to buy art because they also 
have some contact with the artists and 

34
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:24,024
they want to have some contact methey 
artists because it's kind of cool to 

35
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:29,160
have contact with an artist.
It brings something into their life.

36
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,760
And the artist is definitely someone 
who's outside standard hierarchies.

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,713
That's sort of what defines an artist.
So then once you imitate the adaptive 

38
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:38,634
behavior,
then you can play around with the 

39
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:44,271
invitations a bit and you can ritualize 
them and then you can dramatize them and

40
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,260
dramas and interesting thing.

41
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,190
Once it gets,
once it gets formalized,

42
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,830
you know,
because basically what you're doing,

43
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,450
imagine little kids,
they get together,

44
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:56,670
they lay out some rules for pretend 
play.

45
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,310
Then they run us pretend play 
simulation.

46
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,980
Then imagine like little shakespeare 
junior is off to the side and he's taken

47
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:04,814
some notes and maybe he watches six or 
seven different pretend play episodes 

48
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:08,790
and he thinks,
well,

49
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:09,624
this was the most interesting part of 
that and this was the most interesting 

50
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:12,534
part of that.
This was the most interesting part of 

51
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,570
that.
I think I'll put those all together,

52
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,660
make them coherent.
We'll have a really good story.

53
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,793
And what the story is is an articulated 
representation of a dramatic 

54
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:29,010
representation of a set of procedures.
It's two orders of abstraction,

55
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,873
right?
And you know this because when you read 

56
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,290
a book,
I mean this doesn't happen to me anymore

57
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,580
because I think I've read too many 
books,

58
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:39,270
but I can remember when I was a kid,
when I was reading a book of fiction,

59
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,420
it was as if the,
what was being described was playing out

60
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:47,550
in my imagination as embodied fingers.
So you know,

61
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:50,340
sometimes you go to a movie of a book,
you've read and you think,

62
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:51,174
oh,
that person doesn't look anything like 

63
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:53,700
the person in the book,
you know,

64
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:56,160
because you have a representation of 
what the person is like.

65
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,383
I found as I've gotten older that,
and I don't understand this is I don't 

66
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:01,294
have that anymore,
but I still understand the books so I 

67
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:06,700
must've become so automatized.
But that's all gone.

68
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,593
It's,
it's,

69
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,730
it's a loss I would say.
But anyways,

70
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,564
it doesn't matter.

71
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,913
You see that once you get the bloody 
dram or written down or even when you 

72
00:03:17,011 --> 00:03:19,050
can say it,
when you can tell a story,

73
00:03:19,051 --> 00:03:19,884
you're so close to having the,
the pattern revealed in an articulated 

74
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:26,040
manner.
You can't say what the pattern is,

75
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,730
but you can describe it well once you 
can describe it,

76
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:31,980
well,
you're right next to philosophy,

77
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:32,843
right?
As soon as we have a set of dramas that 

78
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:37,050
we can all agree on,
especially once they get written down,

79
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,540
then we can start thinking about the 
dramas.

80
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,060
And that's when philosophy enters the 
stage.

81
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:42,894
As far as I can tell,
it's like the groundwork for look for 

82
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:49,200
philosophy has already laid by centuries
and centuries of human interaction.

83
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,513
And we keep out abstracting that up to 
the point where we can represent it and 

84
00:03:53,491 --> 00:03:54,324
then we can pull out general principles 
and we discussed them and debate about 

85
00:03:57,091 --> 00:03:57,210
them.

86
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:01,140
But that's the birth of philosophy and 
all of those levels interplay.

87
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,033
Like it's not just the causal direction 
isn't just from creative exploration 

88
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:06,564
forward.
It's each time you add a new level that 

89
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:11,010
interacts with the previous level,
right?

90
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:15,240
So you can talk about how you're going 
to play or you can analyze literature,

91
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,310
you know,
or you can think about what you're going

92
00:04:17,311 --> 00:04:18,900
to write about.
So,

93
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,170
so each time you add another level of 
the capacity for abstraction,

94
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:24,720
you make the whole system much more 
dynamic and complex.

95
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,673
So the causal links,
that's why there's all those little 

96
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:28,344
arrows on outside.
All of those areas are interacting with 

97
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:33,110
each other.
So yes,

98
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:39,680
Rama.

99
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,180
Yeah.
Too many arrows.

100
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,690
Yeah.
Let me show you something here.

101
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,660
This is quite cool.
See that?

102
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,520
Did I show you that before?
Oh,

103
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:51,560
this is so cool.
It's mind boggling,

104
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:52,700
this thing.
Okay.

105
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:53,534
So the horizontal line,
you see all the little squiggles that 

106
00:04:57,111 --> 00:04:58,440
are underneath that.
Okay.

107
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,860
Every one of those lines is a biblical 
verse.

108
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,593
And the length of the line corresponds 
to how many references there is to that 

109
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:10,430
verse in other places in the book.
So you look at the bloody thing,

110
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:11,720
man,
that thing's hyperlinked,

111
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:14,420
like mad.
And that's partly why the book,

112
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,583
you know,
think about this book like a normal 

113
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,290
book.
Really what you do.

114
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,723
No,
you go see a movie and there's a 

115
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:21,794
timeline.
There's a beginning and a middle and an 

116
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:24,920
end,
but it's a losery,

117
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,783
right?
Because the person who was writing the 

118
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:29,120
movie saw the whole thing at once.

119
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,163
And so they could use their knowledge of
the ending to fiddle around with the 

120
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:35,600
beginning and they could use their 
knowledge of the middle to fiddle around

121
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,820
with the end.
That doesn't happen in real life.

122
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,073
So you can lay this out.
Now imagine you've got a story and it's 

123
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:45,020
like 5,000
years old and a 150,000

124
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:48,650
people have edited it and they all knew 
the end and the middle and the beginning

125
00:05:48,651 --> 00:05:49,940
and they just go like this.
Well,

126
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:50,774
this means this and that refers to this.
And that refers to this and that refers 

127
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:56,330
to this and this means that.
And well you end up with that.

128
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:02,250
It's like it's infinitely dance.
You can't get to the bottom of it.

129
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,970
There's no way.
And really it's hyperlinked.

130
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,500
So you,
I could,

131
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,363
you could say that in a sense.
The Bible is the world's first fully 

132
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:14,230
hyperlink document.
Weird.

133
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,050
So,

134
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,883
Yup.

135
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:21,931
Yes.
And,

136
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:24,670
and part of that's part of,
that's actually conscious.

137
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,530
Like one of the things that people do 
when they're criticizing Christianity is

138
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:30,364
say,
well if you look at the gospel stories 

139
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:32,434
for example,
there'll be a little story about Christ 

140
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:35,044
and then there'll be this line that says
thus fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy and 

141
00:06:39,281 --> 00:06:40,660
the biblical scholars say,
look,

142
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:41,494
that was put in later.
And the reason it was put in later was 

143
00:06:43,061 --> 00:06:44,740
because the,

144
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,693
the hypothesis of the savior is nested 
in the Old Testament and it keeps 

145
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:54,540
partially coming true with all these 
profits.

146
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,823
So a profit is like a partial savior.
And in the Old Testament prophets are 

147
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,294
just popping up like mad.
And usually what happens is Israel gets 

148
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:06,480
degenerate for one reason or another.
It's because the king isn't being a good

149
00:07:06,481 --> 00:07:07,314
martech basically.
And so then a prophet who's very 

150
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:12,900
insightful,
like Nietzsche or Dostoevsky pops up and

151
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:13,681
says,
hey,

152
00:07:13,681 --> 00:07:14,514
you're not paying attention to the 
orphans and widows and you better get 

153
00:07:17,101 --> 00:07:17,934
your act together because otherwise 
God's going to come along and like 

154
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:20,321
flood.
Yeah,

155
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:22,890
out or your enemies are going to stream 
in.

156
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,710
And of course,
often weirdly enough,

157
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,510
the king's listen because they think,
God,

158
00:07:27,511 --> 00:07:28,344
this person is either completely insane 
or God's talking to him because 

159
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:34,260
otherwise he wouldn't be marching into 
the court when I could have his head cut

160
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:35,094
off with one 10th of a second orders.
So often they kind of half pay 

161
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:40,530
attention.
But what happens,

162
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:43,230
and this is northrop fries 
interpretation fundamentally,

163
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:46,740
is that the whole testament is the 
construction of an empire.

164
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,070
Israel,
it's collapsed because of its failure to

165
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:53,730
follow the fundamental moral order.
Then it rises again,

166
00:07:53,731 --> 00:07:55,230
collapses,
rises again,

167
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,200
collapses.
The first story like that is the flood,

168
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,480
right?
And that's a really,

169
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,430
really old story.
You know,

170
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,210
the Bible doesn't get quasi historic 
until Abraham,

171
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,613
the stories before that.
So that would be like the creation of 

172
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,540
the world,
Adam and eve.

173
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,790
Um,
the Tower of Babel,

174
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,840
Cain and Abel.

175
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,281
No,
no.

176
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:20,760
That's later Noah.
And then,

177
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,633
then the Abrahamic story start.
And that's more like the history of 

178
00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:24,484
Israel.
Even though it's also mythologized the 

179
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:27,220
first set of stories,
man,

180
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,800
those things are old.
Who knows how old,

181
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,750
really old,
50,000

182
00:08:31,751 --> 00:08:33,670
years old.
Maybe they're old.

183
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,103
So anyways,
what happens across time is that people 

184
00:08:37,811 --> 00:08:41,650
have all these biblical books and it's 
like what the Mesopotamians had to do in

185
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:43,210
order to organize their society.
It's like,

186
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:44,560
oh,
we've got all these writings,

187
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,390
they're all sacred.
Hypothetically,

188
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,960
they contradict each other.
They don't seem to be in any order.

189
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,003
Like what are we going to do about that?
And so then there's this collaboration 

190
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:57,590
of minds across to think,
oh hell,

191
00:08:57,591 --> 00:09:00,360
he kind of looks like this might go 
there and then this might go there.

192
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:02,760
And this refers to that.
And this refers to that.

193
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:05,340
And so it is that it's tar,
it's trying to,

194
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:11,160
it's the collective imagination of 
humanity trying to make a coherent story

195
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,040
out of experience.
That's what it is.

196
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,870
And you know,
it's,

197
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,060
you might say,
well it's our best guess.

198
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,350
Is it true?
It depends on what you mean by true,

199
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,640
right.
That's a very,

200
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:25,980
very tricky question.
Partly this,

201
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,100
the question it's trying to answer is 
how should you act?

202
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,250
Let's not the story that's not a 
scientific story,

203
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,400
but it's a bloody important question.
Okay,

204
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,610
good.
So Egypt,

205
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,300
I felt like you didn't know the story 
of,

206
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,763
what was his name?

207
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:45,670
Yeah,

208
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,370
who discovered buoyancy?
He ran through the streets.

209
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,680
Eureka.
Who was that?

210
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,150
Archimedes.
Okay.

211
00:09:52,151 --> 00:09:56,050
So archimedes was trying to figure out 
how to measure the volume of something.

212
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,093
And He,
I think he wanted to figure out how you 

213
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,690
determined whether an alloy was pure 
gold or not.

214
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,870
And so you'd have to get the volume of 
the damn thing and then maybe at a clump

215
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,730
of metal,
there's no way you could measure.

216
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,023
And then he figured out that if you had 
a tub full of water and you drop the 

217
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:11,883
thing in it,
the amount of water that spilled over 

218
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:16,570
the edges would tell you exactly how big
the thing was.

219
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,150
And then you could weigh your thing,
your metal,

220
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,370
and you could tell what proportion of it
was gold.

221
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,750
And so he was so thrilled about that.
He theoretically,

222
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:25,410
he discovered that when he was in a 
bathtub,

223
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,920
he got it in,
the water spilled over.

224
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,160
He ran naked through the streets of 
whatever townie was in yelling.

225
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:31,330
Eureka.
Eureka.

226
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,460
I've got it.
So,

227
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,200
so that's an insight,
right?

228
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,034
So I felt like that when I,
when I read this Egyptian story and I 

229
00:10:38,591 --> 00:10:40,510
thought I figured it out.
So because I thought,

230
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,040
wow,
that's mind boggling.

231
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:42,874
So here's the story.
So we got to show you some of these 

232
00:10:45,341 --> 00:10:46,174
characters.

233
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,463
Hmm.

234
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,810
So the guy in the middle,
that's,

235
00:10:57,811 --> 00:11:00,160
so cyrus,
he's on this pillar.

236
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,620
So he started,
represents what pillars represent,

237
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,050
which is what whole things up.
Okay.

238
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,380
And then the guy on the left,
that's horace and horace is,

239
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,370
he's got the head of a forking.
Okay.

240
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,204
And the reason for that is that falcons 
fly around so they're not attached to 

241
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:17,410
the ground.
And they can really,

242
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:18,071
really,
really,

243
00:11:18,071 --> 00:11:20,320
really see,
like they're birds of prey in there,

244
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:22,390
about the only animal who can see better
than us.

245
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,060
So like rap doors,
birds of prey,

246
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,340
they can see like mad.
Think an eagle.

247
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,340
If an eagle was standing on the top of 
the empire state building,

248
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:34,480
it could see a dime on the sidewalk.
So it's like Gold Eagle.

249
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:39,040
And then the one on the right is isis 
and Isis is queen of the underworld.

250
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,533
Okay.
And then there's one other character 

251
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:42,124
here.

252
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,410
You see that's a Madonna and child.
Basically.

253
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,760
There are that character.
That's seth and seth is,

254
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,090
he's a bad guy now.
No one knows what the hell seth is.

255
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,013
You know,
nobody's been able figure out what kind 

256
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:58,450
of weird animal that is.
So who knows?

257
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,140
But those are the four main characters.
Okay.

258
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:04,030
So now you got to know how they interact
here.

259
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:09,090
So you'd go to Cyrus and the store.
There's variants of this story,

260
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,103
many,
but I'm telling you like one sort of 

261
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,960
canonical variant.
So story of Osiris and Isis and horace.

262
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

263
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,200
So,
um,

264
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,490
and this is the story upon which 
Egyptian civilization was based,

265
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:29,410
although it was a very old civilization,
right?

266
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:30,244
Lasted for thousands of years.
So Cleopatra was last time from 

267
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:39,640
Cleopatra to now than there is between 
Cleopatra and the Pyramids.

268
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,490
So that kind of tells you how old Egypt 
was.

269
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,780
It's like old major civilization lasted 
a long time,

270
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,110
had a powerful story,
a powerfully organizing story,

271
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,130
right.

272
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:51,963
Way older than like,
then the history of Judeo Christian 

273
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:57,950
civilization,
say 2000 years old,

274
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,730
older than Chinese history.
It's old.

275
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,700
China goes back a long ways though.
So,

276
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,800
you know,
maybe it's not older than China,

277
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,900
but it's something there.
Anyways,

278
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,870
well cyrus,
so,

279
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:15,610
oh cyrus was that God who established 
Egypt?

280
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,800
Okay,
so he's like George Washington.

281
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,680
If you had George Washington 2000 years 
from now,

282
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,430
then George Washington would be able to 
cyrus because he'd be mythologized,

283
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:25,510
right?
So basically,

284
00:13:25,511 --> 00:13:26,344
oh,
cyrus represents all the good things 

285
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:32,620
that the Egyptians did to establish 
order from chaos and set up the society.

286
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:34,570
So Cyrus,
he's a great,

287
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:37,690
he was a great hero when he was young 
and he did all sorts of heroic things.

288
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:41,290
And he established the state of Egypt 
and he rules over it,

289
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:46,390
but he's kind of old and he can't see as
well as he used to.

290
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:47,980
And he's little on the muddle headed 
side,

291
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:49,300
but worse than that.

292
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,200
So He's archaic and anachronistic.
And so what that indicates is that,

293
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,620
well,
just like the Americans are experiencing

294
00:13:56,621 --> 00:13:58,210
with their constitution,
it's like,

295
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,250
hmm,
things a little on the old side.

296
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,230
What should we do with it while we 
should update?

297
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,570
It's like,
well we don't want to update it in a way

298
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:06,760
that makes all chaos break forth,
you know?

299
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,623
So anyways,
things get our cat just because they 

300
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:11,110
exist,
right?

301
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:14,520
So if you set up a system of rules,
it's tea,

302
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,510
it's supposed to adapt to this 
environment,

303
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:18,280
but the environment keeps wiggling 
around,

304
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,413
right?
So you have to chase it with the rules 

305
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:23,320
and you have to update the rules as the 
landscape changes.

306
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,410
And that's the biologists call that the 
red queen problem,

307
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:27,244
roughly speaking,
which is a reference to Alice in 

308
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:30,004
wonderland.
So Alice goes down the rabbit hole and 

309
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:34,300
she finds the Red Queen.
That's the queen of chaos,

310
00:14:34,301 --> 00:14:35,134
Mother Nature.

311
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,360
And what,
and she's always chopping people's heads

312
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:38,980
off for arbitrary reasons,
like,

313
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:40,480
yeah.
Um,

314
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,720
and one of the things she tells Ellis' 
here in my kingdom,

315
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:46,660
you have to run as fast as you can just 
to stay in the same place.

316
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,380
And that's the chronic human problem.
It's the problem of entropy,

317
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,243
right?
Is that you build something static but 

318
00:14:53,421 --> 00:14:54,254
things aren't static.
So even if it's a useful thing you've 

319
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:57,680
built,
first of all,

320
00:14:57,681 --> 00:15:00,320
you got to maintain the hell out of it 
cause it's just going to fall apart.

321
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:03,050
But worse than that,
the environments running away from it.

322
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,410
And so your computers have oh,
cyrus problems all the time.

323
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,483
It's like they're just lovely for the 
first three years that you own them and 

324
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:10,454
then their bricks.
And it's because the underlying 

325
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:17,540
landscape is so dynamic that the 
structure you loses its validity.

326
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,700
You can almost watch it lose its 
validity,

327
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,240
right?

328
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,080
As a consequence of the exponential 
increase in computer intelligence.

329
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,410
So Cyrus great guy,
when he was young,

330
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,570
little old fashioned and worse,
he's willfully blind.

331
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,530
Now the Egyptians insisted on that and 
that's so cool.

332
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,053
It's actually you can be held 
responsible in an English common law 

333
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,660
court for willful blindness.
And what willful blindness is.

334
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:47,900
The failure is the failure to realize 
something you could have realized.

335
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,483
So for example,
if you're a CEO and you have a crooked 

336
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,940
chief financial officer and you think 
maybe he's crooked,

337
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,170
but you decide,
well,

338
00:15:57,171 --> 00:16:01,190
I'm not going to look at the books 
because then I know,

339
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,550
and then his malfeasance is brought to 
light and you say,

340
00:16:04,551 --> 00:16:07,040
well,
I didn't know the prosecutor will say,

341
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,570
yeah,
but you could have.

342
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,360
And you knew you could have and you 
didn't.

343
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,490
And so you're,
you're culpable for your own ignorance.

344
00:16:14,491 --> 00:16:16,610
It's like that's such a brilliant idea.

345
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,560
The Egyptians figured this out.
Oh,

346
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:23,150
cyrus is not only old and decrepit and a
little on the Alzheimer he side,

347
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:26,270
but he won't pay attention to things.
He's had it with that.

348
00:16:26,271 --> 00:16:27,104
He's willfully blind.
And that's a problem because he has a 

349
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:33,530
brother who's the evil brother of the 
rightful king,

350
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:35,300
which is a theme that you're all 
familiar with.

351
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:38,600
If you watched your Disney movies,
he's like scar in the lion king,

352
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:39,770
right?
Same Guy.

353
00:16:39,771 --> 00:16:42,830
Or in a Latin,
there's,

354
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:44,420
uh,
some bad character.

355
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,550
I don't remember his name.
Alert.

356
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,800
That's the guy.
Yeah.

357
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:48,680
Yeah.
And so,

358
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:49,430
you know,
he's the,

359
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,700
he's the evil or,
or Darth vader in star wars.

360
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:53,950
It's like,
it's,

361
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,823
he's an archetypal figure.
He's the evil brother of the rightful 

362
00:16:57,981 --> 00:16:59,240
king.
Now,

363
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:01,250
why does the rightful king has an evil 
brother?

364
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,533
That's easy.
It's because organizations tend towards 

365
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:07,940
decay and corruption across time.

366
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,253
That's what they do.
And the Socialists are really on this 

367
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,860
with regards to corporations,
right?

368
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,660
The evil corporations,
it's like,

369
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,640
and the,
and the right wingers,

370
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,331
thank,
oh no,

371
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:20,810
it's evil government.
So they're just projecting the archetype

372
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:24,260
of the negative farther onto the respect
of organizations,

373
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:25,094
when in fact,
it's actually a characteristic of 

374
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:26,894
organizations.
If you don't keep an eye on the damn 

375
00:17:28,431 --> 00:17:31,520
things,
they degenerate and they become corrupt.

376
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,880
So that's just what happens.
You better stay awake to deal with that.

377
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:36,380
So anyways,
oh,

378
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:39,620
cyrus has this evil brother named seth 
and seth,

379
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,910
the name Seth Becomes Satan through the 
Coptic Christians much,

380
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:44,601
much,
much,

381
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:47,000
much later.
So he's like the precursor to the,

382
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,190
to the devil,
roughly speaking.

383
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,990
Now.
Oh Cyrus think staff is all right,

384
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,933
like,
like scar does or like move Fossa does 

385
00:17:55,741 --> 00:18:00,150
with scarp underestimates his danger.
Something you should never do.

386
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,070
And so one day,
oh cyrus,

387
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:02,904
he's just not paying much attention and 
seth gets a big symitar something like 

388
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:10,440
that,
chops them into pieces.

389
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:14,370
And then,
because you can't really kill oh cyrus,

390
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,300
because he's a god as well as being the 
founder of the state and the ruler,

391
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,403
the only thing you can do is make it 
difficult for him to get his act back 

392
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,370
together.
So what seth does is he takes so Cyrus's

393
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,110
pieces and he scatters them all over 
Egypt.

394
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:33,180
And the idea there is that when 
corruption overtakes and organization,

395
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:37,260
then things fall apart.
But the things aren't actually dead.

396
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,153
You know,
it's like when a corporation falls 

397
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:40,770
apart,
all the people in it don't die.

398
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,250
They just fragment into maybe smaller 
groups.

399
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,113
Some companies get spun off or maybe 
they fragment all the way down to the 

400
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:50,220
individual level,
but there's still potency left in it.

401
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,503
And the structure is still there inside 
each of the individuals and the sub 

402
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:55,890
organizations.
So you can,

403
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,540
you can get the damn thing to fall 
apart,

404
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,270
but you can't get rid of it so far.
And he does that.

405
00:19:00,271 --> 00:19:01,104
He scatters these pieces everywhere.
So it makes it hard for old cyrus to 

406
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,770
recollect himself or to get his act back
together.

407
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:11,460
So things fall apart and it's hard for 
you to get your act back together.

408
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,770
That's the idea.
And so,

409
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,340
and then he rules the kingdom,
which doesn't work out very well.

410
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:19,200
Just like scar in the lion king,
right?

411
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:23,310
Because he's an evil tyrant and all 
things considered evil.

412
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:26,250
Tyranny doesn't work that well even for 
the evil tyrant.

413
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,960
Well though you should never assume that
an evil tyrant wants things to work out.

414
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,130
Well,
not even for him.

415
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,100
So anyways,
fine.

416
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,870
Oh,
Cyrus has a wife,

417
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,973
isis now isis,
she's a major league player in ancient 

418
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:46,230
mythology.
Isis as queen of the underworld.

419
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,320
And it's a real costs up.
If you look at archaic cultures,

420
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,860
whether the top God is the guy with the 
order guy like,

421
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:56,160
oh cyrus or the top God is Isis.
He's queen of the underworld.

422
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:59,970
It's like it's 50 50 for sure.
And well,

423
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:00,804
isis represents chaos and oh,
Cyrus represents order and they should 

424
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:05,280
be in balance.
Like,

425
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,383
you know,
if they're in a harmonious balance like 

426
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:08,274
Appsu and Tiamat and they produce all 
sorts of productive things and if one 

427
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:13,620
overwhelms the other,
well then it's not so good.

428
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:17,160
So they should be a harmonious couple.
Okay.

429
00:20:17,161 --> 00:20:19,170
But now I was,
cyrus is dead whack.

430
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:23,250
He's chopped up and spread everywhere.
So op isis comes out of the underworld.

431
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,570
Well that's what happened when the 
Americans invaded Iraq.

432
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,190
It's like,
wow,

433
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,110
well cyrus has gone.
Yeah,

434
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:32,360
but what about Isis?
Oh,

435
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:35,550
we forgot about isis up she comes chaos.
It's like,

436
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:37,920
there it is.
So is it better?

437
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,930
No,
I don't obviously.

438
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,460
So you never want to forget about isis.
So anyways,

439
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,250
Isis,
not that happy that,

440
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:49,084
oh sorry,
Russ has gone because that's her 

441
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:50,381
husband,
right?

442
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:51,760
And she thinks,
well that's not so,

443
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:52,943
so helpful.
So what she does is she runs around 

444
00:20:55,031 --> 00:21:00,031
Egypt trying to find his fellas.
And the reason for that is because it,

445
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,800
it's the seminal apparatus,
right?

446
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:03,634
It's the seed of the new thing.
So what she does is she finds his 

447
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:08,470
Phallus and she makes herself pregnant 
with it.

448
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,050
And so bang,
she goes back down to the underworld.

449
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:13,480
But now she's impregnated.
So what does that mean?

450
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,830
It means when remarkable things fall 
apart into chaos,

451
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,490
the seeds of something new or 
potentially planted.

452
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,450
Okay.
So fine.

453
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,930
She gives birth to horace,
like Arthur,

454
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:31,110
he's outside his rightful kingdom,
just like Simba standard routine,

455
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,490
just like Harry Potter,
right?

456
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:34,690
He's outside his kingdom.

457
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,700
And the reason for that is you're all 
outside your kingdom.

458
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:37,534
It's like the Kingdom is Sorta old and 
archaic and doesn't quite fit the 

459
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:41,164
circumstances now.
And it's not all that fair to you and 

460
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:43,474
it's sort of arbitrary.
And so you grow up to some degree and 

461
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,480
[inaudible] opposition to it.
So it's just an archetypal story.

462
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,780
So this,
this character,

463
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,950
she finally gives birth to this 
character and that.

464
00:21:54,951 --> 00:21:57,040
So Cyrus and no cyrus,
he's,

465
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:59,020
he's quite the character.
He's that.

466
00:21:59,021 --> 00:21:59,950
So sorry.
That's all.

467
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:00,784
Sorry.
His name is horace and that's horace 

468
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,124
there.
And she's the benevolent goddess of all 

469
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:08,920
new things as well as being the terrible
goddess of the underworld.

470
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:13,150
And she knows she's bringing up horace.
Horace,

471
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:16,963
where is he here?

472
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,550
There he is.
So Horace is,

473
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:25,720
this is fulcan cause he can fly around 
and see everything and he's also the eye

474
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:27,490
of the Egyptians.
And so it's like,

475
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:31,240
he's like Marduk these eyes he can see,
okay,

476
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:33,880
so then horace grows up and he's 
thinking,

477
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:36,550
Huh,
not fond the world stuff.

478
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:39,040
I'd like to have my kingdom back,
my rightful kingdom.

479
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,313
And now he's different than oh cyrus.
And the reason these different is 

480
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:45,070
because he can see and normally can he 
see,

481
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,010
he will see.
And that's a whole different thing.

482
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:48,844
So Horace is not willfully blind and 
that's a drag because he can see what's 

483
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:55,210
happened to the kingdom and he can see 
south and that's not so good.

484
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:59,650
It's like you're in in Romeo declares 
position then aren't you?

485
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:02,890
You have to shake hands with the devil.
And you know what happened to Romeo,

486
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:04,150
dell error when that happened.

487
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,130
It's like post term.
He's a general right.

488
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:06,964
I hope you know all know this,
you know he was there in Rwanda when 

489
00:23:09,281 --> 00:23:12,710
everybody got massacred in the u.
N didn't step in property.

490
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,553
Had to watch all that.
It was like post traumatic stress 

491
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:16,594
disorder instantly.
So it's like if your eyes open and you 

492
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:22,990
can see evil,
it's like you better look out because if

493
00:23:22,991 --> 00:23:23,824
you're face to face with real 
malevolence the probability that that 

494
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:29,350
will damage your brain is very high.
You know?

495
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:30,184
And one of the things that's very 
interesting if you think about post 

496
00:23:32,131 --> 00:23:35,590
traumatic stress disorder is that often 
in soldiers it's,

497
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,573
it's,
it's a consequence of something they 

498
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:39,940
did,
not something they saw.

499
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,740
So they'll go out in the battlefield and
they'll find out there far more barbaras

500
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,970
and cruel and destructive than they ever
possibly imagined.

501
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,520
And then they,
how are they going to fit that into like

502
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,120
corn fed farm boy from Iowa skied,
you know,

503
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:54,050
they can't do it.

504
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,090
Poof,
the whole structure is gone.

505
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,880
It's very stressful to find that sort of
thing out.

506
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,510
And the people I've had in my practice 
who have had ptsd,

507
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:03,763
it's almost always because they were 
subjected to some kind of malevolence 

508
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,713
like it was,
they came face to face with something 

509
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:12,350
evil.
And in one case,

510
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:15,500
for example,
I had a client whose boyfriend was going

511
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:16,334
to rape her.
She was naive beyond belief and what 

512
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,503
[inaudible] gave her a posttraumatic 
stress disorder wasn't what he did 

513
00:24:23,451 --> 00:24:25,910
because she could fight him off.
She happened to be bigger than he was.

514
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,320
It was the look of malevolence on his 
face when he attacked her.

515
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,500
That was enough and it she had severe 
psychosomatic syndrome symptoms for four

516
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:36,650
years.
After that,

517
00:24:36,651 --> 00:24:40,310
she couldn't even sleep.
Her whole body would vibrate and it took

518
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:45,080
a lot of untangling before we figured 
out that it was the look on his face and

519
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,123
I've seen that happen.
Other times it's like becoming face to 

520
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:53,030
face with this sort of thing is no joke.
So horace can see,

521
00:24:53,031 --> 00:24:55,640
but luckily he's a long ways from it.
Yeah.

522
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,630
Yes,
I can imagine.

523
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:21,930
He ended up becoming making,

524
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,830
right.
That's a nat tay.

525
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:29,664
That's to put the chaos back in an Ed.
One thing you might want to know about 

526
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:32,964
Hitler is that one day in World War One,
he got a medal for bravery in world war 

527
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:36,884
one by the way.
So Hitler was all sitting around with 

528
00:25:38,341 --> 00:25:40,950
his buddies in a trench and he went off 
to relieve himself.

529
00:25:40,951 --> 00:25:41,784
And when he came back they were all dead
because the shell had landed right in 

530
00:25:44,161 --> 00:25:44,994
the middle.
And so that gave him the idea that he 

531
00:25:46,651 --> 00:25:47,484
was saved for something special.
And I can tell you if that happened to 

532
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:50,970
you,
you would feel,

533
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:53,070
cause what are you using your options.
It's a horrible,

534
00:25:53,071 --> 00:25:53,904
chaotic,
nasty place where brutal things happen 

535
00:25:55,351 --> 00:25:57,330
at random.
That's one option.

536
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:01,530
Or You were saved because something 
special is waiting for you.

537
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,500
So like it's toss up which of those two 
you're going to pick,

538
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:05,580
but you're going to pick one of them.

539
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,370
So anyways,
okay,

540
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,850
so horace,
he can see sec too bad for him.

541
00:26:11,851 --> 00:26:12,684
So he goes back to the kingdom and he 
has like vicious fight with scent and 

542
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:17,484
sets like they're pretty evenly matched.
And so the idea there is that even if 

543
00:26:20,671 --> 00:26:23,190
your horse,
like son of the,

544
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,940
of order and son of chaos and your eyes 
are open,

545
00:26:26,941 --> 00:26:30,060
it's like it's a pretty evil,
it's a pretty even battle.

546
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:30,983
So they're fighting away and seth gets 
to apprehend and he tears out one of 

547
00:26:34,531 --> 00:26:37,260
horses eyes.
And then horace,

548
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,760
which is pretty damaging,
you know,

549
00:26:38,761 --> 00:26:39,594
that's a drag to lose an eye.
So his vision is damaged by his with 

550
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:46,260
evil.
But Horace keeps fighting and eventually

551
00:26:46,261 --> 00:26:47,094
he prevails and it gets the eye back and
he banishes seth to the Nether regions 

552
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:51,684
of the kingdom.
It's like in the lion king where you 

553
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:53,694
know everything,
the light touches is the kingdom and 

554
00:26:55,561 --> 00:26:58,350
then there's the nether regions is 
that's where your sandal seth.

555
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,900
So you can't get rid of him,
can't kill him.

556
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:06,410
He's permanent because societies will 
always tend towards corruption.

557
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,750
Best you can do is get the damn guy 
under control for a while.

558
00:27:09,751 --> 00:27:10,584
Okay,
so now horace has his eye and you think 

559
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,640
and of story,
pretty good story.

560
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:15,474
You could animate that.
He just slapped the old I back in his 

561
00:27:17,341 --> 00:27:18,480
hand,
you know,

562
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,720
pick up the sector and he'd rule happily
ever after.

563
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:26,600
Now it isn't what happens.
What happens instead is he take,

564
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,443
he keeps his eye and he goes back to the
underworld and he finds those Cyrus's 

565
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,480
ghosts down there and it's sort of 
sitting there like this,

566
00:27:33,481 --> 00:27:34,314
you know,
it's cause it's all chopped up and you 

567
00:27:35,641 --> 00:27:36,474
know,
it's a weird combination because in one 

568
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:40,703
plane it's,
it's a chopped up body that's 

569
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:43,860
distributed everywhere.
But down in the underworld,

570
00:27:43,861 --> 00:27:45,390
it's like a ghost,
the spirit,

571
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,370
but it's not very animated.

572
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:52,140
It's sort of in the land of the dead,
like Pinocchio's farther in the whale.

573
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,260
So what does this whole horse do?
Well,

574
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:58,380
he gives,
oh cyrus his eye.

575
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:04,340
So now blind tradition can see and then 
he takes his father,

576
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:08,630
oh cyrus backup to the surface sort of.
Now they're a unit arm in arm,

577
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,560
so to speak.
And it's the,

578
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,190
it's the combination of horizontal Cyrus
that rule Egypt.

579
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,560
And that's what the Egyptians figured 
out.

580
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,431
It's like,
God,

581
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:19,350
that's so smart.
It's like,

582
00:28:19,351 --> 00:28:22,500
well you need this,
you need the traditions of the state,

583
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,780
right,
because you need them.

584
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,310
They're there,
they're vital,

585
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,233
they hold back chaos.
You can't just let that go because then 

586
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,410
income seth and up comes the underworld.
It's like that's not good.

587
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:35,783
You need that as a bulwark.
But then it's old and kind of blind and 

588
00:28:39,361 --> 00:28:42,210
it's going to tend towards corruption 
and fall over of its own accord.

589
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,043
So how do you solve that?
And the answer is it pay attention and 

590
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:51,840
you provide dead tradition with living 
site.

591
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,823
And if you do that,
then you get to be the ruler of the 

592
00:28:55,111 --> 00:28:57,510
state,
the rightful ruler of the state.

593
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:01,740
Now the Egyptians basically hypothesize,
this took a long time,

594
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,890
that the Pharaoh also had an immortal 
soul.

595
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,933
He was the only person who did.
But the immortal soul was basically the 

596
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:09,714
combination of Horace and oh Cyrus.
So the Egyptians conceptualize that as 

597
00:29:14,701 --> 00:29:16,980
something that was eternal.
So,

598
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,470
and it was the,
it was the eternal,

599
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,980
it was the central eternal feature of 
sovereignty.

600
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,110
It's so smart.
And so as long as the Pharaoh was a good

601
00:29:28,111 --> 00:29:28,944
horace Ando Cyrus at the same time,
then he was the rightful sovereign and 

602
00:29:32,941 --> 00:29:36,060
he was reflecting something of the 
utmost value.

603
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,730
And it was a mortal.
It's so smart.

604
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,190
So what happens,
interestingly,

605
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,520
they call this the democratization of 
old cyrus.

606
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:49,480
So to begin with in the Egyptian state,
you could only use the horace.

607
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:50,314
Oh Cyrus symbolism.
If you were either of the Pharaoh to 

608
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:55,330
begin with,
or at least a high ranking aristocrat.

609
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,990
But what happened as Egypt progressed,
so to speak,

610
00:29:58,991 --> 00:29:59,824
as it developed across time,
is that the right to use the symbolism 

611
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:04,743
that that was the horror.
So Cyrus conjunction drifted down the 

612
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:12,580
dominance hierarchy.
So at some point all the aristocrats got

613
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:13,414
to use,
it never drifted down to like women are 

614
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:17,560
Carmen,
people are slaves or anything like that.

615
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:18,723
But you know,
hypothetically the Jews came out of 

616
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:22,684
Egypt and one of the things the Jews 
said that went beyond the Egyptians was 

617
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:31,891
that each person was,
was capable,

618
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:33,963
was ennobled in some sense by their 
potential relationship with the highest 

619
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,580
value that was gone.
And when the Christian showed up.

620
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:42,370
But that was universalized everyone had 
it,

621
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,380
even prostitutes and slaves.

622
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,510
So it's so cool because what happens is 
these societies get the idea of,

623
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:54,540
of sovereignty laid out in this 
phenomenal heavenly drama.

624
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,690
And they identify that with the thing 
that's at the top of the hierarchy,

625
00:30:58,691 --> 00:30:59,524
which is what they should do.
But then what happens across time is 

626
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:02,950
everybody wakes up and thinks,
oh,

627
00:31:02,951 --> 00:31:05,890
that's so interesting.
It's characteristic of the Pharaoh.

628
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,560
It's characteristic of what should be 
sovereign.

629
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,140
It's characteristic of what the highest 
value is,

630
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,920
but it's actually characteristic of 
everybody and it's,

631
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:15,754
it's almost impossible to overstate how 
important that is because our whole 

632
00:31:19,331 --> 00:31:20,164
conception of the idea of natural rights
is predicated on the idea that there's 

633
00:31:24,971 --> 00:31:25,804
something about you as an individual 
individual whose value is inviolable so 

634
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:34,920
much that it doesn't even matter what 
you do.

635
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:35,963
So if I see you brutally murdered 20 
people and there's 50 eye witnesses and 

636
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:41,154
we know for sure you did it,
you still have to be treated as if your 

637
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:50,301
central essence is of tremendous value 
and you have to be given due process.

638
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,750
The whole law bows down before that.
And so then you think,

639
00:31:54,751 --> 00:31:56,550
well,
do people believe this?

640
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,413
This sort of horace oh cyrus combination
and its relationship to what's 

641
00:32:01,261 --> 00:32:05,160
ultimately valuable and the fact that 
that's embodied in every person.

642
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:07,530
It's like they certainly act like they 
believe it.

643
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,513
And if,
if they ever encounter a violation of 

644
00:32:10,501 --> 00:32:13,260
that in practice,
especially social practice,

645
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,540
everybody's jumping up and down in 
complaining.

646
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:18,870
It's like you're trampling on my rights.
What do you mean?

647
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,940
Where'd those come from?
What exactly?

648
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:25,941
What are they and are they real or not?
And if they're not real well,

649
00:32:27,661 --> 00:32:31,140
then I can trample over them all I want 
because they're not real.

650
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,863
But if they,
and then we can just have an argument 

651
00:32:34,341 --> 00:32:35,174
about what human beings are like,
but if they are real and they're 

652
00:32:38,421 --> 00:32:39,254
reflective,
an underlying principle that's 

653
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:44,570
continually attempting to manifest 
itself in a sense from the bottom up,

654
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:45,883
you better not break the rules because 
you're really going against the cosmic 

655
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:51,680
order.
So that's the Egyptian story.

656
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,850
It's like,
oh,

657
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,003
it's mind boggling.
It's no wonder that story had enough 

658
00:32:55,731 --> 00:32:59,570
dynamism to,
to propel a whole culture across several

659
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:02,330
thousand years.
It's like it's a staggering achievement.

660
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:11,090
Ready today is sort of a primary,

661
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,600
yeah,
don't.

662
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,730
So that's a really good,
that's a really good observation.

663
00:33:23,731 --> 00:33:25,860
That's just one of the things that I 
really,

664
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:27,853
it's something new that I've figured out
about all of this in the last five 

665
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,070
years.
For a long time,

666
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,620
I still haven't got this right.
It's like,

667
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:35,454
okay,
what is your reaction when one of those 

668
00:33:37,951 --> 00:33:38,784
principles is violated?
So this is like the terror management 

669
00:33:40,921 --> 00:33:41,754
question,
right?

670
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,440
Well,
for the terror management people,

671
00:33:43,441 --> 00:33:44,274
it's fear,
but there's a real problem with that 

672
00:33:46,621 --> 00:33:51,210
because conservatives tend to be less 
neurotic than liberals and conservatives

673
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:56,260
who have more of a propensity for right 
wing authoritarianism are more likely to

674
00:33:56,461 --> 00:33:59,700
get upset when rules are violated.
But the rules seem to be,

675
00:33:59,701 --> 00:34:00,930
so,
I think it's more,

676
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,370
or I thought that it was more,
no,

677
00:34:02,371 --> 00:34:03,510
no,
it's not exactly.

678
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:06,480
If your rules get violated,
it's not exactly fear,

679
00:34:06,481 --> 00:34:07,314
although fears part of it,
it's the disintegration of your 

680
00:34:10,261 --> 00:34:13,500
motivational states into general 
preparation for,

681
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,573
for readiness.

682
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,503
So that's more like a generalized stress
response and so everything goes on so 

683
00:34:18,751 --> 00:34:21,120
that you're able to deal with what 
happens next.

684
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,523
It's like Gottman's married couples when
they're the ones that are going to get 

685
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:26,491
divorced,
right?

686
00:34:26,491 --> 00:34:30,150
They're very calm on the surface.
But underneath it's like the underworld,

687
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,013
all hell is broke loose,
but then there's been a twist in that 

688
00:34:33,421 --> 00:34:34,254
because there's a bunch of data coming 
together from all over the world that 

689
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:37,974
basically goes like this is that right 
wing authoritarianism seems to be based 

690
00:34:42,841 --> 00:34:43,674
on purity and purity is discussed 
control and there's a deep biological 

691
00:34:48,931 --> 00:34:49,764
route route for that.
Like people who are disgust sensitive 

692
00:34:52,831 --> 00:34:57,390
and concerned with purity have better 
standards of hygiene and they do tend to

693
00:34:57,391 --> 00:34:58,224
live longer,
but they're also very much against 

694
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:03,680
temperamentally against any form of 
sexual contact.

695
00:35:03,681 --> 00:35:08,220
It isn't bounded by the social contract 
and they don't like foreigners,

696
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:09,960
but that's all a clump.

697
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,200
It's all the same thing.
And then we've found recently,

698
00:35:13,201 --> 00:35:14,034
we haven't published this yet,
we've found recently that we know 

699
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,980
conservatives are more conscientious 
than liberals.

700
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,203
And then we found that conscientiousness
fragments into industriousness and 

701
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:26,820
orderliness,
which was great because people have been

702
00:35:26,821 --> 00:35:27,654
wondering for five decades how you plug 
the proclivity for right wing 

703
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:33,480
authoritarianism into the general 
personality structure.

704
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,860
And it's complicated because if you're a
radical liberal like a lefty,

705
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,200
those aren't liberals.
Sorry,

706
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,970
radical lefty,
a communist.

707
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:42,804
You can be just,
it seems like you can be just as 

708
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:46,260
authoritarian as you would be if you 
were a fascist.

709
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:49,440
So you know,
that hasn't been quite sorted out yet,

710
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,663
but it's the orderliness that seems to 
make people have this right wing 

711
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:55,794
proclivity and it does look like what 
they're trying to do is control 

712
00:35:57,721 --> 00:35:59,880
discussed.
So yes.

713
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:03,390
So what,
what the violation of that order,

714
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,433
a huge chunk of it seems to be in this 
entirely new negative emotion system 

715
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,103
that we've only been untangling for 20 
years and it's not associated with 

716
00:36:13,741 --> 00:36:14,574
neuroticism.

717
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,030
Liberals are actually more neurotic than
conservatives.

718
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,111
You know,
when you could say,

719
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:21,900
well that's because the conservatives 
are so well protected.

720
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:22,561
It's like,
no,

721
00:36:22,561 --> 00:36:22,921
no,
you,

722
00:36:22,921 --> 00:36:23,754
you can't post hoc use your theory to 
predict the opposite of what you would 

723
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:29,010
have predicted before the data comes in.
And it's like,

724
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:30,390
no,
conservatives are,

725
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,283
they should be more physiologically 
reactive and there's some evidence that 

726
00:36:34,051 --> 00:36:37,230
they are,
but it does really seem to be discussed.

727
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,810
And so to jump ahead a little bit,
when and after we'd sorted this out,

728
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,820
now a lot of the work that was done on 
disgust was done by Jonathan Haidt.

729
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,310
He's the guy that deserves the credit 
for the discussed purity linkage.

730
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:51,144
It's a big deal.
And he was pushing a study of discussed 

731
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:55,410
long before people were paying any 
attention to it.

732
00:36:55,411 --> 00:36:56,244
So good for him.
When I was working on the orderliness 

733
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:00,684
discussed relationship,
I was also reading this book by Hitler 

734
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,370
called Hitler's table talk.

735
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,350
And what it was was,
uh,

736
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:07,763
he would talk at his dinners and they 
collected it from 1939 to 1942 and he 

737
00:37:12,181 --> 00:37:15,270
would like just spout off on whatever it
was that was on his mind.

738
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:18,300
And he was a very open person.
So it's very lateral discussion.

739
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:20,040
He was very interested in art and 
culture,

740
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,203
but he was very,
very orderly and he was a worshiper of 

741
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:26,730
willpower and orderly.
People are like that like,

742
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,610
um,
anorexics are orderly to orderly.

743
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,713
They can't even stand their own bodies.
It's discussed that their bodies elicit 

744
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,630
and they prize the ability to control 
their bodies.

745
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,440
And that's hyper orderliness.
That's I think why it's associated.

746
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:44,190
It's generally considered an upper 
middle class disease.

747
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,623
And I think that's because a lot of 
people who are at that strata are hyper 

748
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,630
conscientious and that gets passed onto 
their kids and sometimes that's just too

749
00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:52,350
much.

750
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,183
Anyways,
one of the things that really struck me 

751
00:37:56,671 --> 00:37:58,650
about Hitler's writings,
and it really,

752
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,330
it really blew me away,
I'll tell you,

753
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:04,650
was that he has a metaphor.
All of this thinking's metaphorical,

754
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:09,060
and the metaphor is the area in race is 
a pure body,

755
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,140
pure blood,
pure uncontaminated,

756
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,000
and it's under assault by pathogens and 
parasites.

757
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,313
Now,
as soon as you know that bang he's got 

758
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:25,731
is you've got the underlying dynamic of,
of his appeal to the masses and Germans,

759
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,490
hey,
they're orderly.

760
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,673
So you know,
one of the things people say is that 

761
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,900
what happened in Germany constituted 
that decline of civilization,

762
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:39,520
right back to barbarism.
It's like,

763
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,950
ah,
maybe not.

764
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,310
Conscientiousness is associated with 
productivity,

765
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:49,270
quite highly correlations about 0.4,
roughly the same as the correlation with

766
00:38:49,271 --> 00:38:50,104
Iq.
So conscientiousness is a prerequisite 

767
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:54,310
for civilization.
And you can think,

768
00:38:54,311 --> 00:38:55,144
well,
why would you be disgust sensitive and 

769
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:57,250
an orderly?

770
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,540
And the answer might be,
well,

771
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:02,950
how much of your grain do you want rats 
and mice to eat because they eat lots of

772
00:39:02,951 --> 00:39:03,341
it,
right?

773
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,140
And keeping the insects out of food 
store,

774
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:06,370
that's really,
really hard.

775
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:09,250
So if you're going to store things up,
which is what you're going to do,

776
00:39:09,251 --> 00:39:10,084
if you're going to be civilized,
you better start to be concerned with 

777
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:13,600
hygiene,
you know?

778
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,910
So those things are gonna go together.
Well,

779
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:19,480
Hitler was hyper orderly and hyper 
disgust sensitive.

780
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,323
He'd washes,
he bathed four times a day and he was 

781
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:27,880
very,
very happy about the ability to stand in

782
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:30,730
the back of his car,
has prayed car and keep his arm out like

783
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:33,760
this for eight hours.
He thought of that is the triumph of the

784
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:34,594
will.
You know when the will seem to be 

785
00:39:35,951 --> 00:39:38,890
associated with this pro propensity 
towards orderliness.

786
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,660
So another thing that's really 
interesting and,

787
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,633
and I still don't exactly know what to 
make of this because it has complicated 

788
00:39:45,371 --> 00:39:46,204
my conceptualization because a lot of 
what I'm going to show you is based on 

789
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:54,760
fear and horror and horror is more like 
fear plus discussed.

790
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,713
It's some,
you know the difference between the 

791
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:59,830
Blair witch project and the Texas 
chainsaw massacre.

792
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,813
They're both horror movies,
but one is pure fear and the other is 

793
00:40:03,131 --> 00:40:08,131
almost pure discussed.
So disgust seems to be a huge element of

794
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:11,920
this and it is a primary response by 
orderly people to the violation of moral

795
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:14,530
norms.
Now here's something weird.

796
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,023
There was a paper published in Plos one 
about a year ago and what these people 

797
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:21,544
did was they,
they did I think I within and across 

798
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:31,540
country survey,
and this wasn't in developed countries.

799
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,003
So the question was how much infectious 
disease was there in each of these 

800
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:42,841
geographical locales?
And the next question was how right wing

801
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:48,130
were the people who occupied those areas
at the individual level?

802
00:40:48,131 --> 00:40:50,350
So they weren't interested in what the 
government was like.

803
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,693
And what they found was that the 
correlation between the prevalence of 

804
00:40:53,891 --> 00:40:58,891
infectious diseases and right wing 
authoritarianism at the individual level

805
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:01,980
was 0.6
it's like,

806
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,400
and if you know anything about 
statistics,

807
00:41:03,401 --> 00:41:04,234
when you see 0.6
you just fall over at hyperventilate 

808
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,760
because that never happens.
It's an effect size that's,

809
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:10,803
it's bigger than 99% of the effect sizes
that you never encounter in the social 

810
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:16,780
sciences.
It might be 99.9%

811
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,070
higher.
The infectious disease rate,

812
00:41:21,071 --> 00:41:23,380
the more right wing totalitarian the 
population.

813
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,020
Why?
Well,

814
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,863
why do you think they're regulating 
inter personal contact and sexual 

815
00:41:29,171 --> 00:41:30,190
behavior?
Why?

816
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,150
Well,
think about it.

817
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,003
You know,
they're trying to minimize disease 

818
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:38,810
transmission vectors fundamentally.
Now they're not trying to do that.

819
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,790
You know what I mean?
It's an ad that patient,

820
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,590
keep yourself out of contact,
keep yourself isolated

821
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,970
cause it takes place within a 
generation.

822
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,330
Well,
I don't know.

823
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,360
I don't know that you know,
because lots of those places,

824
00:41:55,361 --> 00:41:58,240
there've been infectious diseases for a 
very long period of time.

825
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,550
So,
but anyway,

826
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:04,580
so that's all very unsettling 
information because it sheds it.

827
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,000
So what did it implies?
And this is quite cool,

828
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:11,500
it implies that the best way to control 
right wing authoritarianism is to,

829
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,100
is to instigate effective public health 
policy.

830
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:20,260
So if you all,
if everyone has a sewer and a toilet and

831
00:42:20,261 --> 00:42:21,094
there's no infectious disease,
there aren't any right wing 

832
00:42:22,991 --> 00:42:25,210
authoritarians anymore cause they're not
necessary.

833
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,240
Now that might be an overstatement,
but,

834
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,280
but it also might not be,
you know,

835
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,114
it's definitely one of the prerequisites
for the kind of stability and 

836
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:35,554
productivity that's characterized the 
west is that all of our cities has have 

837
00:42:38,591 --> 00:42:40,990
functional sewer systems and everybody 
has a toilet.

838
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:42,243
It's like,
it turns out that makes a big 

839
00:42:44,561 --> 00:42:47,020
difference,
especially when you don't have one.

840
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:49,210
Is it fair to say?

841
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:59,490
Well it should,
it should bring it out.

842
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:00,410
You know,
and I'm,

843
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,280
I'm a reasonably orderly person.
You know,

844
00:43:02,281 --> 00:43:06,420
if I go into a place that's chaotic,
especially if it's chaotic and,

845
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,830
and,
and filthy,

846
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:08,963
I have a really,
really powerful impulse to tromp around 

847
00:43:11,701 --> 00:43:13,680
until it's fixed.
You know?

848
00:43:13,681 --> 00:43:14,514
Cause it just strikes me as things are 
deteriorating in a bad direction around 

849
00:43:18,931 --> 00:43:20,160
here.
You know,

850
00:43:20,161 --> 00:43:21,630
so,
and I'm not,

851
00:43:21,631 --> 00:43:22,464
I wouldn't say that.
What am I most outstanding 

852
00:43:23,731 --> 00:43:25,560
characteristics as orderliness,
but it's,

853
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,450
it's,
it's up there.

854
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:30,030
I'm a reasonably conscientious person.
So yeah,

855
00:43:30,031 --> 00:43:33,150
it's a visceral response and the 
visceral responses,

856
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:36,050
something needs to be done about this,
you know,

857
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,730
and you can see how that's associated 
with conscientiousness.

858
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,133
So what we've been trying to figure out,
what makes conscientious people 

859
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:46,530
motivated because conscientiousness 
predicts life success.

860
00:43:46,531 --> 00:43:47,071
It's like,
well,

861
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,690
are they interested in what they're 
doing?

862
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:51,270
No,
it's due to fullness.

863
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,820
Okay.
So why is that a motivator?

864
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:55,613
We're thinking that what the 
conscientious person wants is not to 

865
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:01,320
slide into the disgusting bottom of 
things.

866
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,290
So imagine the hierarchy.
Okay.

867
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:08,940
Top is pure bottom is contaminated.
Why?

868
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:10,740
Well,
I can tell you one reason.

869
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:15,360
If you take a given geographical locale,
this is even true for songbirds.

870
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:19,680
And you'll rank order the denisons of 
that locale by their dominance position.

871
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,870
And then you let a pathogen in the 
animals die from the bottom up,

872
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,350
right?
So the bottom of the dominance hierarchy

873
00:44:28,351 --> 00:44:29,184
is where all the pathogens hang out.
And if that's disgusting and it's 

874
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:36,000
morally impure and you're bad if you're 
down there,

875
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,060
which is really a conservative 
viewpoint,

876
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,880
many ways it's your fault you're there,
right,

877
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:44,550
and are not going to be there no matter 
what.

878
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:48,030
And so I think what the conscientious 
person is doing is fleeting the bottom.

879
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:52,020
They're not trying to get to the top 
except that that's the farthest away you

880
00:44:52,021 --> 00:44:54,870
can get from the bottom.
And that's a purity motivation.

881
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:56,183
Now we don't know that yet because we 
haven't been able to figure out how to 

882
00:44:58,651 --> 00:45:00,470
motivate industrious people in the 
lounge.

883
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,060
So which is weird,
right?

884
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:05,580
Because conscientiousness predicts life 
success.

885
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:06,414
You'd think that you could find a task 
in the lab that conscientious people 

886
00:45:09,391 --> 00:45:11,250
would do better than non conscientious 
people.

887
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:14,790
We've tried dozens of things and not 
being able to do it.

888
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:15,624
So now we're,
we're trying to make people embarrassed 

889
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:18,114
and ashamed and see if we could get them
to like donate more to a charity if we 

890
00:45:21,421 --> 00:45:24,180
do that.
Based on the idea that what's motivating

891
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:29,181
the conscientious person is a flight 
from contamination could easily be.

892
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,090
So it's quite mind boggling.
Like it was a twist.

893
00:45:33,091 --> 00:45:33,750
It was a twist.

894
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:34,800
I,
I'd never,

895
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:37,650
I'd never forecast in my 
conceptualization of these things.

896
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:40,080
But the underworld,
you know,

897
00:45:40,081 --> 00:45:42,840
it's a place of chaos and fear,
but the underworld that's hell,

898
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:44,910
it's full of sulfur is odors,
you know,

899
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:45,611
it's,
it's,

900
00:45:45,611 --> 00:45:50,611
it's not only terrifying,
it's also disgusting and it's associated

901
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:54,810
symbolically with disgusting elements of
the body as well.

902
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,690
So,
and purity,

903
00:45:57,691 --> 00:45:58,524
obviously sexual purity for example,
is certainly a hygiene purity add 

904
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:04,920
mixture and it's,
it's,

905
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:09,480
it's flight from contamination and no 
wonder,

906
00:46:09,481 --> 00:46:10,314
right.
I mean there are sexually transmitted 

907
00:46:11,251 --> 00:46:12,084
diseases.
It's like a major vector of disease 

908
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:16,350
transmission.
We saw that with the AIDS outbreak.

909
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:18,330
You know,
without,

910
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,193
without us airplanes,
there wouldn't have been any aids 

911
00:46:22,351 --> 00:46:24,000
outbreak,
you know,

912
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:27,660
jet planes plus promiscuity.
It was like,

913
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,920
Hey,
you know,

914
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:31,770
we almost generated a virus that took 
down the whole planet.

915
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,660
So it's no joke when these things escape
from their,

916
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:38,340
from their little box,
you know,

917
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:38,971
you might say,
well,

918
00:46:38,971 --> 00:46:42,000
why aren't people allowed to have the 
sexual life they want?

919
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,820
Well,
the disease there,

920
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,713
the relationship between disease 
transmission and promiscuity is 

921
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:52,560
exponential.
That's why.

922
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,540
So you know,
you might think,

923
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:56,010
well that's no reason.
It's like,

924
00:46:56,011 --> 00:46:57,840
okay,
maybe not,

925
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,003
but

926
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:03,500
I dunno how many hundreds of millions of
people have died from aids,

927
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,540
but it's lots

928
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,660
so you know.
Yup,

929
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,253
we'll do that later.
We're going to be doing a lot of 

930
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:16,560
distinguishing of that.
In fact,

931
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:21,740
that's a primary problem of men 
distinguishing Isis.

932
00:47:22,171 --> 00:47:24,780
So that's the feminine underworld from 
evil.

933
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,640
Right?
Right.

934
00:47:26,641 --> 00:47:28,920
Because the,
because because there there's a negative

935
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:32,950
element to both of them.
If you haven't differentiated properly,

936
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:35,470
then the woman can carry that whole 
load.

937
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:38,260
That happened to some degree with eve 
for example,

938
00:47:38,261 --> 00:47:39,160
in the,
in the,

939
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,293
in the genesis story,
it's so interesting because if you read 

940
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:44,050
genesis,
we're going to talk about that later.

941
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:48,580
The person who looks really bad in 
genesis isn't eve.

942
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,640
The person who looks really bad is Adam.
No.

943
00:47:51,641 --> 00:47:53,840
So either offers him the apple and like 
a dance.

944
00:47:53,841 --> 00:47:57,250
He takes it but then God comes along 
afterwards.

945
00:47:57,251 --> 00:47:59,230
He's all self conscious now and so is 
eve.

946
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,333
And so God comes along to have a little 
walk without him like he's used to 

947
00:48:03,011 --> 00:48:03,280
doing.

948
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,113
And Adam is hiding in the bushes because
he's naked and he doesn't want God to 

949
00:48:06,461 --> 00:48:08,980
see.
And so God calls them on,

950
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:10,810
it says like,
hey buddy,

951
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:12,640
I can see through bushes,
you know,

952
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,490
come out here where I can talk to you.
And Adam says,

953
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,393
oh,
a naked,

954
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,400
I can't come out.
And God says,

955
00:48:18,401 --> 00:48:21,580
how do you figure that out?
And Adam being there,

956
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:25,420
heroic creature that he was said,
you know that woman you made for me,

957
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,040
it's her fault.
It's like,

958
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:28,840
well,
who's the villain in that story?

959
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:32,380
He such a weasel that when he gets 
called on his disobedience,

960
00:48:32,381 --> 00:48:34,330
the first thing he does is blame the 
woman.

961
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:35,261
It's like,
yeah,

962
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:37,180
yeah,
well that's an archetypal story.

963
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:39,070
I'll tell you that.
You know,

964
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:41,560
soul,
the temptations of Eve,

965
00:48:41,561 --> 00:48:42,394
you know,
it's like the rapist to blame the 

966
00:48:43,361 --> 00:48:45,250
attractiveness of the woman for the 
rape.

967
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:48,880
It's like the devil made me do it,
you know?

968
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,193
So anyways,
it's very difficult to distinguish one 

969
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:54,004
form of negative from another.
And partly what we're going to do when 

970
00:48:56,111 --> 00:49:00,280
we go through the symbolic 
differentiation process is put things in

971
00:49:00,281 --> 00:49:04,000
their proper place.
So I would say that's this,

972
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,460
nope,
that's the wrong direction.

973
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:14,383
Sorry,
I want to show you this one diagram and 

974
00:49:16,101 --> 00:49:17,470
then we'll stop.
Okay.

975
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,950
There.
So for me,

976
00:49:32,951 --> 00:49:36,370
that's the map of the symbolic sphere.
Okay.

977
00:49:36,371 --> 00:49:39,370
So what you have in the very background 
is the dragon of chaos.

978
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,233
That's the absolute unknown as such.
So you can think about it is the chaos 

979
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:48,490
from which everything else emerges.
So that's the unknown unknowns.

980
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,170
Okay?
On top of that,

981
00:49:50,171 --> 00:49:52,870
there's a feminine layer and that's the 
great mother.

982
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:54,850
And the great mother has a positive 
aspect.

983
00:49:54,851 --> 00:49:58,170
She's mother of all things and she has a
negative aspect and she's,

984
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,593
she's angry.
Tie Amat the force of death that pulls 

985
00:50:01,901 --> 00:50:04,630
all biological creatures back into her 
grasp,

986
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:08,050
creation and destruction.
So on top of that,

987
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:11,890
there's culture and culture protects you
from the great mother.

988
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:12,773
Just like with OCI receipt.
Isis stays in the underworld where she 

989
00:50:15,101 --> 00:50:15,934
belongs.
But culture has a negative element in a 

990
00:50:17,711 --> 00:50:19,390
positive element.
So it's,

991
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:22,660
it's patriarchal represented by 
masculine sagers.

992
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:27,280
But it has an element that offers order 
and an element that offers tyranny.

993
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,390
And there's always a balance between 
those two.

994
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:32,540
And so if you're a conservative,
you think hooray order.

995
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:33,740
And if you're a lefty,
you think,

996
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:35,840
oh no tyranny.
And you're both right,

997
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:38,600
right?
Because every organization tends towards

998
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:40,640
tyranny and supports you at the same 
time.

999
00:50:40,641 --> 00:50:42,830
So it's,
it's right on top of that.

1000
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:43,993
There's the archetipal individual that's
also represented in masculine form for 

1001
00:50:48,201 --> 00:50:49,034
reasons that we'll get into later,
but it has a positive and a negative 

1002
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:52,034
two.
And the positive is the creative 

1003
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:58,040
explorer moving out into the darkness 
with Eyes Open.

1004
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,410
And then there's the counterpart of 
that,

1005
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,430
which is the thing you shake hands with 
when you're Romeo Dallaire and you shake

1006
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:06,980
hands with the devil.
And that's the individual too.

1007
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,830
And one of the things I would,
you can think about this,

1008
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:10,664
but one of the things that I really like
about this map is that I think it's the 

1009
00:51:15,321 --> 00:51:16,730
antidote for radiology.

1010
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:21,860
And the reason for that is that you can 
map it theologies onto this map,

1011
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,530
but the ideology is only give you half 
the story.

1012
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:28,280
So like the last wing story would be 
lovely,

1013
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:33,440
virginal mother nature being tyrannized 
by the evil corporations as civilization

1014
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:36,710
advances led by the adversarial 
individual.

1015
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:38,443
But the right wing story is the heroic 
individual bringing order into chaos to 

1016
00:51:44,121 --> 00:51:47,630
avoid the destructive element of,
of the natural world.

1017
00:51:47,631 --> 00:51:49,520
So That's like the frontier myth that,
that,

1018
00:51:49,521 --> 00:51:51,890
that uh,
that settled the United States,

1019
00:51:51,891 --> 00:51:55,280
right?
Heroic pioneers moving civilization into

1020
00:51:55,281 --> 00:51:58,100
the chaotic unknown and just slam those 
two together.

1021
00:51:58,670 --> 00:51:59,503
And then you've got the real problem,
which is that nature slash the unknown 

1022
00:52:03,771 --> 00:52:08,771
is a creative source of everything.
And it will pull you into pieces if,

1023
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,230
if it has the opportunity.
And then culture,

1024
00:52:12,231 --> 00:52:16,880
it's like you can talk and it's warm.
You better be happy with culture,

1025
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:17,983
but the probability that it's going to 
take you and crunch you and try to turn 

1026
00:52:20,841 --> 00:52:22,190
you into a car,
he's like,

1027
00:52:22,191 --> 00:52:23,360
yeah,
that's what it's going to do.

1028
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:25,760
That's what it does.
And then there's you,

1029
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,720
well,
yeah,

1030
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,460
you're wonderful,
interesting.

1031
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:29,870
You know,
great creature,

1032
00:52:29,871 --> 00:52:32,810
but look the hell out.
So,

1033
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:34,170
and that's right.
That,

1034
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:38,690
and I think the archetipal stories do a 
lovely job of continually bringing those

1035
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:42,170
elements together,
so well.

1036
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,580
Okay.
So that's good enough.
