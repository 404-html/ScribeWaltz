1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,333
So back in February,
I received the following letter from a 

2
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:10,740
student at Linfield college and 
according to its website

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,370
with campuses in Mcminnville,
Portland,

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,653
and a prestigious online program.
Linfield college is a premier choice in 

5
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:23,160
the Pacific northwest for a high quality
traditional liberal arts education.

6
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,583
Want to learn more,
contact us for details about her degree 

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,420
and certificate program offerings.
A student there who I won't name

8
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,170
sent me the followup letter.
Dear Dr Peterson.

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,130
I'm an undergraduate student and 
Linfield college in Mcminnville,

10
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:41,964
Oregon.
The international students for Liberty 

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,473
Conference recently granted me a small 
sum to organize pro liberty events on 

12
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:52,080
campus with an emphasis on the 
importance of free speech.

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,873
I'm writing to ask you if you're 
accepting speaking invitations at this 

14
00:00:56,641 --> 00:01:00,060
time and if you're scheduled sometime 
between now and may,

15
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,730
would allow it to help narrow down my 
options.

16
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,903
I would like to offer you $1,500 and an 
invitation to speak here this spring 

17
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:09,600
semester.

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,390
Your travel and accommodation costs will
also be covered.

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,090
I perceived Linfield as an institution 
at an ideological crossroads.

20
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,403
I feel it is my responsibility to pick 
the most effective voice possible for 

21
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:23,724
helping linfield chart a course that 
will ensure its future as a place of 

22
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:30,990
reason and academic integrity.
After listening to many of your lectures

23
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:31,824
and interviews,
I believe your message is ideal for our 

24
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:34,584
campus.
Honest and productive argumentation is 

25
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:38,184
one of your specialties.
Linfield would greatly benefit from 

26
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:42,960
being introduced to your ideas on the 
subject.

27
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,420
We're a small college of roughly 2000 
students situated in quiet wine country.

28
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,183
Your work continues to have a deep 
impact on my personal and intellectual 

29
00:01:52,861 --> 00:01:54,930
growth.
I'd be honored to hear from you.

30
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,020
Thank you for your time and 
consideration.

31
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,203
So after considering it for a while,
I agreed to come and speak at Linfield 

32
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,840
College.
On March 18th,

33
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:10,920
I received a note from an invitation 
student,

34
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,830
the inviting students who said,
good morning Dr Peterson.

35
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,270
I would be overjoyed to confirm a date.
So we went about doing that

36
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,790
on April seventh.
He replied to me again to update me.

37
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,880
He said the talk will be held in Ice 
Auditorium in Melrose Halt April 24th,

38
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,653
beginning at 7:00 PM.
I'm referring to the events simply as a 

39
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:35,064
talk with Jordan Peterson because his 
speaking style allows for a lot of 

40
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,410
fluidity in topic.
However,

41
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,800
the core theme to the event is the 
importance of freedom of speech,

42
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:49,070
especially in higher education.
Some of the administration slash student

43
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:53,490
government have began to fret about the 
potential for people to feel open,

44
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:54,420
quote,
offended,

45
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:57,300
and oppressed.
Close quote by Peterson's talk.

46
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,550
It's more pushback than I expected at 
Linfield.

47
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,650
What?
I don't think it's a cause for concern.

48
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,463
I'm fighting hard to keep their worries 
at bay and there's a very supportive 

49
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,470
group of students and community members 
who have my back free speech.

50
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,543
We'll win on April 17th.
The following article appeared in 

51
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,040
student newspaper

52
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,430
Kenny Neal,
editor in chief.

53
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,630
It's called hate symbol on ball riles 
campus.

54
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,170
The linfield young Americans for liberty
groups,

55
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,680
free speech ball outside of Walker Hall 
on April Twelfth,

56
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,783
received attention from students and 
faculty when a student drew pepe the 

57
00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:37,964
frog,
which has recently been appropriated by 

58
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:40,394
white supremacist groups.
Linfield college posted the picture of 

59
00:03:43,551 --> 00:03:44,384
the ball when it's instagram account,
but it was later removed because of the 

60
00:03:46,731 --> 00:03:47,564
frogs association with alt right groups.
As soon as it was pointed out that the 

61
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:54,290
photo included the image,
the instagram post was removed.

62
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,760
President Thomas Heli set the free 
speech ball event.

63
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,773
The first event in this freely at series
at Linfield encouraged students to 

64
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:04,304
express themselves by writing and 
drawing on the ball to promote free 

65
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:10,220
speech.
Pepe the frog is a popular Internet meme

66
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,353
that is often appeared in humorous ways.
The Anti Defamation League has listed 

67
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,110
pepe the frog on its hate symbols 
database.

68
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,903
I only heard about it secondhand and I 
understand that it is a place for free 

69
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:24,620
speech,
but in all reality,

70
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,510
it was certainly done in very poor 
taste.

71
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,250
Junior John Christianson set according 
to its website,

72
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,520
the a mission is to open quote,
identify,

73
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,540
educate,
train,

74
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:38,750
and mobilize youth activists committed 
to winning on principle.

75
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,950
Our goal is to cast the leaders of 
tomorrow and reclaim the policies,

76
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,320
candidates,
and direction of our government.

77
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,930
Post quote,
a member of Y,

78
00:04:47,931 --> 00:04:50,360
a l drew the pepe,
the frog on the ball,

79
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,960
but asked to remain on identified open 
quote,

80
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,650
I knew the person who drew happy.
He didn't draw it to be negative.

81
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,840
He drew it to be funny.
Close quote,

82
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,210
senior Parker Wells,
a member of y,

83
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:05,150
a l sad.
He continued.

84
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,450
We understand some groups appropriated 
the image,

85
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,550
but any image can be appropriated.
Wells set his goals with the free speech

86
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:14,474
ball,
where to get people thinking about the 

87
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:19,370
rights to free expression and to bring 
more attention to the y a l group.

88
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,643
He said,
I understand that it's necessary to set 

89
00:05:23,721 --> 00:05:24,554
limits,
but I don't think this cartoon fraud is 

90
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:27,014
a limit to set for free speech.
I find it unfortunate that people can 

91
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,390
enjoy this event because of the frog 
image

92
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:34,963
as a part of it's speak freely.
Series y a l is bringing Dr Jordan 

93
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,490
Peterson to campus on Monday,
April 24th.

94
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,930
The group is also showing the 
documentary the red pill on Tuesday,

95
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,063
May 2nd

96
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,880
professor of English resume Dot Fowler.
Stab,

97
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,670
stab,
open quote.

98
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,593
I find both the invitation of Jordan 
Peterson and the screening of the 

99
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:56,774
documentary,
the red by the young Americans for 

100
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,324
Liberty Club,
extremely problematic problematic 

101
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:02,684
because neither peterson northern film 
will be promoting dialogues about 

102
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:06,014
gendered inclusions,
but rather be promoting a dangerous and 

103
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,284
offensive logic of gendered exclusions.
Dr [inaudible] continued promotion of 

104
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:16,534
such exclusionary practices,
greatly threatened safe spaces for our 

105
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,374
students,
staff and faculty who belong to 

106
00:06:21,671 --> 00:06:26,260
marginalized groups and violates our 
ethos of upholding mutual respect on our

107
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:31,261
campus.
The president's diversity committee will

108
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:32,174
hold a discussion at 5:30 PM on Monday 
in the pioneer reading room titled Free 

109
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:37,610
Speech,
what it is and what it is,

110
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:41,330
not the discussion.
We'll examine free speech and members of

111
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:43,700
the Linfield community or encouraged to 
attend.

112
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,490
So that's the end of that newspaper 
article.

113
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,623
So I read that it was forwarded to me 
soon after I tweeted the following 

114
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,020
message.
Open quote,

115
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:00,820
I'm violating some more safe spaces.
Suit Linfield College.

116
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,990
April 24th.

117
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,453
Well,
on April 19th I received a letter from 

118
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:09,244
the student who'd organized my car.
He said things have gotten nuclear this 

119
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:14,794
email.
The one I'm going to read to you was 

120
00:07:16,781 --> 00:07:17,614
just sent to all of Lynnfield.
One of the stipulations they are 

121
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:24,880
referring to is the contract which they 
rejected because it was a day late.

122
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,433
Our Club is currently looking for space 
in downtown in Mcminnville to hold 

123
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,920
Peterson's stark and step.
The media is likely getting involved.

124
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,020
I'm sorry for this insanity.
We tried very hard to keep things simple

125
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:38,854
here.
So here is the letter sent out to the 

126
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,280
entire community

127
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,463
linfield community.
I am writing on behalf of the Linfield 

128
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:52,280
cabinet as officer in charge,
what President Kelly is out.

129
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,300
I want to let the Linfield community 
know that the Aas,

130
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:57,134
Llc Associated Students of Linfield 
College has determined it will not fun 

131
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,043
Dr Jordan Peterson's appearance next 
week because stipulations for the event 

132
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:08,000
were not met by the requester,
young Americans for liberty.

133
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,720
Since the authorization parameters,
we're not satisfied.

134
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,570
The college will not host the event on 
April 24.

135
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,413
Among the stipulations was that the 
event was to be a private linfield 

136
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:23,801
college only event by his own tweet 
yesterday to 107,000 followers.

137
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,350
Dr Peterson indicates he would be open 
quote,

138
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,790
violating more safe spaces soon.
Linfield College,

139
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,713
close quote,
likeminded supporters from outside or 

140
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:40,721
community have responded affirmatively.
Our policy on anti harassment protection

141
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,260
and academic freedom states that open 
quotes,

142
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,213
anti harassment policies are not 
intended to limit the free exchange of 

143
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:52,280
opinions or the vigorous debate over 
ideas.

144
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,530
However,
intimidation,

145
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:56,040
harassment,
exploitation,

146
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,053
and the use or threat of force are 
incompatible with the preservation of 

147
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:01,344
this freedom.
The letter continues based on the 

148
00:09:05,141 --> 00:09:05,974
speaker's own words.
This event no longer presents the 

149
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:11,380
possibility of academic inquiry within 
the Linfield community.

150
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,170
Our policy is clear.
Open quote,

151
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,303
harassment and intimidation preclude the
very possibility for maintaining an 

152
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,470
atmosphere of academic freedom.
We cannot welcome speakers,

153
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,423
witness stipulations for their 
appearances are not mapped and who 

154
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:27,664
attend,
who intend to violate the safety of our 

155
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:33,160
community.
Respectfully,

156
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,380
Susan at Kipp and hand.

157
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,400
So I wrote a letter to Susan Agora 
Chippenham.

158
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,630
Now you understand that by this time the
flights had been arranged,

159
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:48,390
the accommodation had been arranged,
everything was in place,

160
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,760
and of course they had known about this 
for a long time.

161
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,283
Dear Susan,

162
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,853
I received a copy of your letter to the 
Linfield community this morning as well 

163
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:01,460
as an indication that my long scheduled 
talk at Linfield has been canceled.

164
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:02,923
That is fine,
I suppose except that the plane tickets 

165
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:05,774
have been booked and the hotel 
reservations have been made as well as 

166
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:11,300
three days taken out of my schedule at 
my expense.

167
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,191
Alright,
thank you.

168
00:10:13,191 --> 00:10:14,024
Are Treating me and the student group 
who invited me in a manner that is 

169
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,560
absolutely reprehensible as well as 
cowardly and underhanded.

170
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,993
I have made arrangements to come to 
lynnfield which is extremely distant 

171
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:28,460
from me and that was the way in good 
faith.

172
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,343
Now you cancel it with a plethora of 
specious reasons including your anti 

173
00:10:34,521 --> 00:10:35,354
harassment policy.
Although I have harassed no one nor 

174
00:10:37,581 --> 00:10:38,930
intimidated,
exploited,

175
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,973
or threaten force had I not previously 
received notice of the controversy 

176
00:10:44,271 --> 00:10:46,640
around my arrival,
which is in my opinion,

177
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:47,474
unwarranted.

178
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:52,100
I would not have tweeted my intent to 
open quote violate safe spaces,

179
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,233
close quote,
which is a satirical comment in case it 

180
00:10:55,941 --> 00:10:56,774
needs to be said.
Obviously you were looking for any 

181
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:01,730
excuse no matter how trivial to cancel 
this event.

182
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,493
You also note that open quote,
this event no longer presents the 

183
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:11,780
possibility of academic inquiry within 
the Linfield community close quote,

184
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,250
I might point out that Lynnfield is a 
college not a community,

185
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,980
and that ideas need to be discussed in a
college.

186
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,410
You also state that open quote,
anti harassment policies are intended to

187
00:11:24,411 --> 00:11:28,130
limit the free exchange of opinions or 
the vigorous debate over ideas,

188
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,580
close quote and then proceed to do 
exactly that.

189
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,440
You also mentioned that you have 
received support from open quote,

190
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,493
likeminded supporters,
close quote from outside of your 

191
00:11:39,621 --> 00:11:40,454
community,
which is hardly surprising or 

192
00:11:42,231 --> 00:11:44,840
informative,
given that they were likeminded.

193
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,130
You also suggest that because the 
contract was delayed one day,

194
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,083
that constitutes sufficient grounds for 
cancellation even though you knew well 

195
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:54,544
that the event was booked and finalized 
and it's such delays are by no means 

196
00:11:57,431 --> 00:12:02,170
unheard of in such situations.
You might also note that a guest invited

197
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:03,004
to your college might expect to be 
treated with a modicum of consideration 

198
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:09,520
and respect.
Here's what I plan to do.

199
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,283
I'm going to make a video tomorrow 
morning at the latest reading this 

200
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:14,884
letter on Youtube.
Explaining that by invitation has been 

201
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:21,100
revoked what that means for me and the 
nature of the reasons given.

202
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,910
I will also read this letter of response
from me.

203
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,690
It shouldn't be watched by about 150,000
viewers,

204
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,360
many of whom I imagine will be linfield 
alumni,

205
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,253
supporters and students.
I'm perfectly willing to see what they 

206
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:38,980
all have to say.
Then we can let the dust settle where it

207
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:40,450
may sincerely.

208
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,540
Dr Jordan Peterson,
professor of psychology,

209
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,493
University of Toronto.
I received absolutely nothing in 

210
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:48,520
response.
God,

211
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,363
no,
he didn't even have the decency to send 

212
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:54,670
me a notification explaining their 
rationale.

213
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,700
Nothing.
So I was treated as far as I'm concerned

214
00:12:57,701 --> 00:12:58,920
with,
with uh,

215
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,260
well,
let's call it unprofessionally and leave

216
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:04,660
it at that.
So what's the story now?

217
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,160
The organizing students tried to book an
alternative venue.

218
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,270
They didn't have enough money to rent a 
suitable theater or lecture hall.

219
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,613
I told them that they could use my 
honorarium to pay for the space which 

220
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:19,024
they did.
The yamhill valley news registered 

221
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,353
Dotcom posted this update April 20th off
campus venue found for controversial 

222
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:29,134
Speaker Linfield college student 
government organization this week with 

223
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:36,070
drew permission for a newly organized 
club,

224
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,113
young Americans for liberty to bring up 
controversial speaker to campus for a 

225
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:41,530
free public talk.
Monday,

226
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,900
the group has responded by lining up an 
off campus location for the presentation

227
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:48,943
featuring Jordan Peterson,
Canadian professor whose campaign 

228
00:13:52,371 --> 00:13:53,204
against gender neutral pronouns is 
considered offensive by some do the 

229
00:13:57,381 --> 00:13:58,214
transgender population.
Peterson has been rebooked for seven to 

230
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:02,234
9:00 PM at the falls event center,
housed in the former chapel on the 

231
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:08,720
evergreen aviation and space museum 
campus.

232
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,773
So on with the show,
and you can figure out what I think of 

233
00:14:15,231 --> 00:14:18,530
the linfield administrators who pulled 
this stunt on your own.

234
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,020
Thanks for watching.

235
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,620
Members of the community
community for liberty,

236
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,323
other organizations that support this 
events in those who travel to get here 

237
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,610
along with the people on the live 
stream.

238
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,123
My name is Lucas Carter and I'm the 
president of the linkage chapter of 

239
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:49,971
young Americans for liberty.
My Vice President Keeper Smith Been.

240
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,020
You've been in the coordinator market 
grills

241
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,750
in Secretary Alton Ramsey who was 
handling tonight's a live stream.

242
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,480
Thank you.

243
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,423
So we're the team that organized this to
ensure that liberty wants a night 

244
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,750
judging by this parallel.
I think we accomplished that,

245
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,370
but first,
just a couple of technical things to get

246
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,370
it.
Either way,

247
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,383
we're all doing a live stream because we
received support from all over the 

248
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:38,534
nation and I mean all over.
So we're asking to stay off the white 

249
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:43,604
bike please.
So all our friends and families can 

250
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,800
enjoy this live stream without any 
hiccups.

251
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,530
Uh,
secondly,

252
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:56,590
we do have a donation bucket in the back
to help cover a Jordan Peterson's travel

253
00:15:56,661 --> 00:15:57,494
expenses.
Right now my goal is a $750 in any 

254
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:04,130
excess funds will go towards his 
research.

255
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,033
So moving on,
I can talk a little about the club when 

256
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,000
keiffer nice story of this club.
Back in February,

257
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,760
we didn't know what to expect.
We didn't have a vision.

258
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,360
However,
given recent political events,

259
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,970
not just the
splits,

260
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,363
many people are afraid to speak out over
years of aspects to how was the club as 

261
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:39,850
Dr Nate Libertarian values,
let's engage the public in the community

262
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,640
and like open free the bait for the sake
of intellectual advancements,

263
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,780
being able to debate,
being able to reach conclusions with St,

264
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,733
t in respect to one another's,
I'd like to think leadership that just 

265
00:16:57,021 --> 00:16:57,854
introduced all the hard work towards it 
towards accomplishing this goal that we 

266
00:17:02,561 --> 00:17:05,510
truly believe in.
Finally,

267
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,720
I was the best next semester as chapter 
President Keeper Smith era.

268
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,250
Take over next semester after I 
graduates.

269
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,391
Now,
more importantly,

270
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:20,240
there was something I need to address to
the lingo community

271
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:26,890
on behalf of the club
on behalf of the club in the leadership.

272
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,383
I like to take this time to publicly 
apologize for eating unintended harm 

273
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,210
that has occurred over these past two 
weeks.

274
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:43,850
It is not within the clubs with tensions
degenerate any arm or create environment

275
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:47,900
where people feel unsafe.
We just want to make that clear.

276
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,213
We want people be more movement.
That's our intention and I'm also going 

277
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:56,780
to ask the public to not raising it.
Pitchforks at my school.

278
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:58,803
I love my school early.
Do I didn't move all the way out here 

279
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,440
more to just to like trash anything.
I love my school.

280
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:10,380
And beyond that situation behind the 
scenes is a lot more complex than what's

281
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:15,381
been released to the public.
Cloud itself has made mistakes too and I

282
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,600
just got to say thank you for 
cooperation in these matters.

283
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,430
Now I'd like to introduce the main 
coordinator of this events.

284
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,820
He has done far more work than any of 
us.

285
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,690
You know,
he spoke with Pearson for an advance.

286
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,450
He spoke with the media who found this 
venue last minute.

287
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,343
Such a beautiful venue by the way.
He handled most of the paperwork and 

288
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:39,710
more.
I can't think of another note.

289
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,930
Please welcome event coordinator Parker 
Wells.

290
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,820
Thank you.

291
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,793
Hello everybody.
I'm a senior at college and I'm 

292
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:01,890
overjoyed to see a third response,
uh,

293
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,860
considering ms dot Dubay had some major 
complications just last week.

294
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,460
Uh,
it's overwhelming.

295
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,780
The response has been so,
so positive here.

296
00:19:10,781 --> 00:19:12,720
So thank you for that.
Um,

297
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,420
I have to express my gratitude to 
students for liberty young Americans,

298
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:19,300
for liberty,
for students who are unsure about how to

299
00:19:19,301 --> 00:19:20,134
get involved on your college campuses.
I highly recommend the network of 

300
00:19:23,801 --> 00:19:24,634
liberty minded organizations because 
they've been very supportive throughout 

301
00:19:26,891 --> 00:19:31,180
this whole whole thank you to them.
Lastly,

302
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:36,181
I like to frame tonight's talk as an 
opportunity for us to open our minds and

303
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:42,550
make an honest effort at understanding 
each each other and on that note all the

304
00:19:43,481 --> 00:19:47,950
way from the University of Toronto.
Please welcome Dr Jordan Peterson.

305
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:53,110
Thank you.
Thank you burt,

306
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:16,030
and also thank you for your persistence.
The first thing I'd like to say is that

307
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:28,430
Parker told me can 10 minutes before the
talk that he has very much enjoyed going

308
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:31,824
to linfield college,
which I just had had the opportunity to 

309
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:39,570
stroll through absolutely spectacularly 
beautiful lakes.

310
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,140
Looks like everyone's dream of a classic
Liberal Arts College,

311
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:48,141
and so he wanted me to let everyone know
that he's had a great time in Europe.

312
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,840
He didn't want to bring any disrepute on
colleges,

313
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,753
so I thought I'd end up.
It's important to know that it's easy 

314
00:20:57,491 --> 00:21:01,330
for things to be made black and white 
because that's simple,

315
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:04,140
but certainly things are the least bit 
simple.

316
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,673
It's useful to keep that in mind.
So I'm going to start this by reading 

317
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:15,250
you something that I wrote specifically 
for this talk.

318
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,953
I want to.
I always want to do something different 

319
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,583
in each talk because one of the previous
talk and part of the reason that you 

320
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:30,940
talk is to get things clear in your 
mind.

321
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,540
It's a good way of thinking.
It's the best way of thinking.

322
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,150
So I suppose in some sense it's opens a 
poll.

323
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,340
Maybe that's what it is.
It's.

324
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,303
It's what I hope to cover tonight.
So what I'm going to do is read you the 

325
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:46,114
outline first.
I guess it's an outline and then I'm 

326
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:48,994
going to go through it line by line and 
see if I can clarify to us and also to 

327
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:54,820
beat what I mean.

328
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,173
So I'm going to orient the talk tonight 
around the ethics of free speech we've 

329
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,650
talked about about or thought a lot 
about,

330
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,513
let's say the right to free speech and 
something you might want to also 

331
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,264
consider the obligation to free speech 
because I actually think it's deeper 

332
00:22:16,061 --> 00:22:20,830
than a right.
I think you're obligated to speak freely

333
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,023
because otherwise people don't have the 
benefit of your whatever wisdom you 

334
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:31,190
possess and at least you possess the 
wisdom of your own experience.

335
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:36,100
At the very least you have that and 
that's as valid as a form of truth,

336
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:36,934
as any other form of truth and it's 
often a truth that can be usefully 

337
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:44,630
communicated to other people.
And so it's to the communities benefit.

338
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,543
You say what your experience has taught 
because there isn't anyone who has 

339
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:50,914
experience like you and one of the 
things that I've learned from being a 

340
00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:55,204
clinical psychologist,
but I would say more specifically from 

341
00:22:57,071 --> 00:23:00,940
being a very careful listener,
is that if you listen to people and they

342
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:04,000
can talk to you,
they tell you the most amazing things.

343
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,290
You know,
my,

344
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,183
my typical week I work,
even today I was speaking to four 

345
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:12,604
different people.
They're supporters of mine online and I 

346
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,253
beat some of the and I had four 
conversations that were just absolutely 

347
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:27,700
profound and it's so interesting because
if people are allowed,

348
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,623
encouraged to express themselves and 
that's something that you could do by 

349
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:37,111
listening to someone,
they open up and they were there as it's

350
00:23:37,601 --> 00:23:38,434
as interesting as a Dostoevsky know 
people's actual lights are 

351
00:23:41,501 --> 00:23:42,334
extraordinarily interesting and and 
important that they can speak freely 

352
00:23:46,731 --> 00:23:47,564
about them because then they can tell 
you all the things they know that you 

353
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:52,670
don't know and then you get to know them
and that's such a good deal.

354
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:55,550
So.
So

355
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,033
I'm going to tell you some things that I
believe to be true and constitute the 

356
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,333
back of his talk.
So the first thing is that life is 

357
00:24:08,771 --> 00:24:09,604
suffering.
And then I would say that this is an 

358
00:24:13,731 --> 00:24:14,564
attempt to.
This is my attempt to reconcile the 

359
00:24:18,281 --> 00:24:22,390
existence of multiple transcendent 
virtues.

360
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,573
Transcended virtues are the lights that 
guide you through your life essentially 

361
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:28,983
that the principles by which it's 
necessary to live if you're going to 

362
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:38,741
have a life that's meaningful and 
profound and beneficial,

363
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,180
and there are multiple transcendent 
values.

364
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,400
It isn't clear how they relate to one 
another,

365
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,233
and
this is my attempt to understand how 

366
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:56,171
they relate to so I started with the 
truth that I believe to be supreme,

367
00:24:56,691 --> 00:24:57,524
which is that life is suffering and then
that love is the desire to see 

368
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,620
unnecessary suffering,
ameliorated

369
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,373
and the truth is the handmaiden of law
and the dialogue is the pathway to 

370
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:20,160
truth.
And then humility

371
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:27,260
is recognition of personal insufficiency
and the willingness to learn

372
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,533
and then to learn is to die voluntarily 
and be born again in great ways and 

373
00:25:35,861 --> 00:25:36,694
small.
So speech must be untrammeled so that 

374
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:48,730
dialogue can take place
so that we can all humbly learn.

375
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,970
So the truth,
concert law,

376
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,960
so that suffering can be ameliorated
so that we can all stumble forward,

377
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:05,120
so to speak,
to the Kingdom of God.

378
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,290
So I'll try to unpack that.

379
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,573
Well,
I think the idea that light is 

380
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:17,860
suffering.
This comes as no surprise to anyone

381
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,450
in my estimation.
There's two reasons for that.

382
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:28,120
One seems to have to do with the 
structure of being itself,

383
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:29,703
and by that I mean
there seems to be something about 

384
00:26:35,651 --> 00:26:36,484
limitation that's required for existence
and it's a difficult notion to make 

385
00:26:41,171 --> 00:26:42,004
clear,
but I can tell you a little story about 

386
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,330
what I call him.
My son was young when he was three years

387
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:49,750
old.
Um,

388
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:56,540
I thought he was a remarkable creature.
I thought Saint Nicholas,

389
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:00,090
my daughter,
there's something remarkable.

390
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,260
Have little kids.

391
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,160
No,
they're,

392
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,993
uh,

393
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,140
they're a little beacons of enthusiasm 
and wonder.

394
00:27:09,141 --> 00:27:09,974
I suppose it,
although it takes great effort to care 

395
00:27:13,191 --> 00:27:14,024
for them,
they repaid you partly by their 

396
00:27:17,241 --> 00:27:18,074
enthusiasm and partly by the fact that 
they looked at the world as if it's a 

397
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:28,150
new thing and that allows you to do the 
same thing when you're around them.

398
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,510
So they refresh the world for you.
And,

399
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,130
and that's,
that's a great thing.

400
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,120
Now,
of course,

401
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:36,643
if you're a parent,
one of the things that sprite Info your 

402
00:27:39,921 --> 00:27:43,040
children is that they're vulnerable.

403
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,943
That's part of the burden of 
responsibility that's associated with 

404
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,063
being a parent,
but then you might think about that 

405
00:27:53,411 --> 00:27:54,244
vulnerability as a well as a liability.
I suppose that's one way of thinking 

406
00:27:58,421 --> 00:28:00,550
about it,
but then I thought,

407
00:28:00,551 --> 00:28:03,880
well that's an interesting way of 
looking at it that it's only a liability

408
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,310
because maybe you would like your child 
not to be vulnerable.

409
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:11,380
But then I thought that through and
not the practical map price close.

410
00:28:13,511 --> 00:28:14,440
I thought,
well,

411
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,910
because I was worried,
you know,

412
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:16,744
he'd go up the street and the car would 
go into the playground and some bully 

413
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,300
would knock them over a dog bite up or 
something like that,

414
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:23,134
you know,
and of course little kids are always 

415
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:27,730
backing themselves and falling down the 
stairs and that kind of thing.

416
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,280
And
I thought,

417
00:28:30,281 --> 00:28:31,114
well,
what would you have to do to have a 

418
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:36,130
little being that didn't have those 
problems?

419
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,410
Well,
I thought you could.

420
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,080
Well,
it's like a superhuman intelligence.

421
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:43,914
That would be a start.
It could be 20 feet tall instead of 

422
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,273
three feet tall and he can be encased in
titanium and know he could be made him 

423
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,443
vulnerable or at near invulnerable.
But the problem with that is that you 

424
00:28:58,021 --> 00:29:02,710
have to replace what he was piece by 
piece until there was nothing left.

425
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,303
And so that's one.
That was partly when I realized because 

426
00:29:08,761 --> 00:29:11,400
realizations like this of course unfold 
over time,

427
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,520
that when you,
when you deeply care for someone,

428
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:17,190
you don't care for them.
Despite their vulnerability.

429
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:21,600
You care for them with the knowledge 
that their vulnerability as an intrinsic

430
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:22,434
part of them.
You care for the remarkable fact of 

431
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:26,394
their weakness and specificity just as 
much as you care for them for whatever 

432
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:35,100
abilities they bring to bear whatever 
capacities they have.

433
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,173
And so to love someone is to Simmel 
tediously accept their vulnerability as 

434
00:29:40,891 --> 00:29:41,724
a valid part of their feeding and that's
a necessary thing to do in life because 

435
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:50,730
life is suffering and but without,
without,

436
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,990
without the vulnerability that brings 
suffering,

437
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:57,610
then there doesn't seem to be any 
possibility of individual existence.

438
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,443
And so to me,
it seems that in order for us to exist 

439
00:30:01,271 --> 00:30:04,810
as individuals,
in some real sense,

440
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,003
we have to be limited in precisely the 
manner that we are limited in the Ba in 

441
00:30:09,671 --> 00:30:12,700
some sense requires that limitation and 
that vulnerability.

442
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:16,050
There is an old idea,
I don't remember where I read it.

443
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:20,020
It was many years ago.
I think it was from Jewish commentary on

444
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:23,500
the Torah.
It was like a Zen Koan almost.

445
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,523
The question was what does it being with
the classical attributes of God 

446
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:31,420
omniscient,
omnipotent and omnipresence?

447
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:35,650
What does it feel like now?
It's a very interesting question because

448
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:38,020
of course,
obviously the obvious answer is,

449
00:30:38,021 --> 00:30:38,890
well,
nothing,

450
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,383
but that's the wrong answer.
The right answer is to be like that 

451
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:44,014
blacks limitation and the commentator 
was putting that argument forward as a 

452
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:49,294
justification for the creation of man.
And I thought that was a spectacularly 

453
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:53,973
brilliant insight that there was 
something that something that lacks 

454
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,350
nothing,
blacks max lack itself.

455
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,490
And I read something about something 
written by Kierkegaard where he said the

456
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:07,324
same thing.
He said that he knew himself as someone 

457
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:11,584
who was never going to be able to make 
life easy for people in the way the 

458
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:14,834
great,
the great inventors of the late 19th 

459
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:20,290
century had been things increasingly 
easy for people and so that his task was

460
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:21,124
going to be to determine how was he 
could make life more difficult for 

461
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:28,780
people and he knew he would be thanked 
as one of the benefactors of the age for

462
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:32,280
doing precisely that regard.
Tempted to,

463
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,873
I suppose lay a heavy moral burden on 
his readers and he knew that that was 

464
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,520
perhaps not something that people would 
appreciate immediately,

465
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:45,574
but perhaps on reflection they would 
find that that was exactly what they 

466
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:48,874
wanted and one of the things that speak 
very remarkable to me as I've been 

467
00:31:54,071 --> 00:31:59,071
speaking to people recently is that 
because I think that I'm doing something

468
00:31:59,111 --> 00:32:02,050
similar.
I'm trying to lay a burden on people and

469
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:06,750
by all appearances I'm trying to lay a 
burden on me.

470
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,100
At least that's who's responding to it.
I mean,

471
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,570
look at this audience.
It's like it must be 95 percent.

472
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,850
It's very,
very interesting to me,

473
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,033
but,
but there's something about about 

474
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,023
responsibility.
It's associated with the transcendence 

475
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:29,761
of suffering and it's absolutely 
necessary for life to proceed properly,

476
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,153
so life is suffering because we're 
vulnerable and it's also suffering I 

477
00:32:37,681 --> 00:32:42,590
would say because we're evil and I've 
tried to define evil.

478
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,610
There's the tragic part of life is the 
fact that our,

479
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,223
our vulnerability is built in and we we 
have psychological problems or physical 

480
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:59,030
problems and we all die and that's part 
of the structure of existence.

481
00:32:59,031 --> 00:32:59,864
It's the same structure that brain is 
about tornadoes and hurricanes and 

482
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,930
earthquakes and natural catastrophes of 
all types.

483
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:06,764
It's,
it's the impartial brutality of reality 

484
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,970
and that contributes greatly to human 
suffering.

485
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,130
Probably would be,
as I said,

486
00:33:16,131 --> 00:33:18,170
it also be a precondition for being 
itself,

487
00:33:18,171 --> 00:33:19,004
but then there's the other kind of 
suffering that we bring the corner 

488
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:22,623
herself and I would categorize that 
under the heading of malevolence and 

489
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,840
malevolence is the desire to break,
to increase suffering in some sense,

490
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:34,400
for the sake of suffering itself.

491
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,233
It's like an art form.
I think that's the best way to 

492
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,410
conceptualize it.
Something is authentic.

493
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,400
It's the same aesthetic that drove the 
Nazis to put that up.

494
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,770
Terrible Jill,
about gates of Auschwitz,

495
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:46,604
which was that work with make you free,
and of course the freedom that is being 

496
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:55,160
offered it in the Nazi camps was death 
and that was great,

497
00:33:55,550 --> 00:34:00,350
terrible joke and it's.
It's a very malevolent spirit that would

498
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,193
dare to joke in that manner,
but that's the spirit that we all have 

499
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,343
attended because there's part of each of
us that because of the suffering that 

500
00:34:08,301 --> 00:34:09,134
life entails is bitter about existence,
would wish in some sense to see it 

501
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:18,670
eradicated and something I learned from 
reading those great play faust.

502
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,133
He as a character in there 
Mephistopheles who's sort of the 

503
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:26,240
intellectual version of Satan,
I suppose,

504
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,143
and hurt the has mephistopheles attempt 
to explain the reason for his existence 

505
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:34,430
or at least the reason for his modem.

506
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,180
Ba in memphis softly says memphis golf 
means basically says,

507
00:34:38,181 --> 00:34:39,980
if you're.
That hasn't say this twice,

508
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:40,814
that because the existence is 
characterized by such dreadful 

509
00:34:43,761 --> 00:34:44,594
suffering,
it would be better if it never existed 

510
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:48,200
at all.
And that's what he's bringing.

511
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,310
Working to bring about.
And that struck me in a very

512
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:58,930
deep manner because I had recognized by 
that time that life was difficult enough

513
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:01,963
so that it was challenging to walk 
through it without becoming embittered 

514
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:09,260
and resentful,
let's say,

515
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,320
and and then to become arrogant because 
of that,

516
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:14,970
and then to become a judge of existence.
Because of that,

517
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,093
if you ever wonder,
of course you do what is going through 

518
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:19,874
the minds of people who do such things 
as shoot up elementary school's full of 

519
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,333
schoolchildren knowing the things that I
just described is very useful in 

520
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:33,041
developing some understanding because 
the people who do that are resentful and

521
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:36,610
bitter and the brooded upon it for well 
not hours,

522
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,490
weeks,
months and years,

523
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,630
and they conclude that existence itself 
is evil and that it should be.

524
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:43,883
It should be taken revenge upon.
The way that you take revenge on 

525
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:52,670
existence most precisely is to find the 
most innocent people and punish them the

526
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,580
most.
Dreadful,

527
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:59,030
and that's the motive behind shooting 
elementary school kids in a playground.

528
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:03,420
Let's say that's a very dark place to 
go,

529
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,340
but that's a place that people are 
perfectly capable of going up.

530
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,543
The terrible thing is that we have the 
motivation to go there and you can make 

531
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,304
a rational case for going there,
but that doesn't make it the proper 

532
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:20,340
place to go and that brings me to the 
second point,

533
00:36:20,341 --> 00:36:24,480
which is that love is the desire to see 
unnecessary suffering.

534
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,343
Ameliorated lob is a very difficult word
to use because in some sense it's been 

535
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,810
most today.
I know such a commonplace.

536
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,063
If you're attempting to affect virtue,
then the first thing you do is speak 

537
00:36:39,271 --> 00:36:43,260
about love and it's very difficult to 
speak about love without feeling.

538
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:48,070
I would say self contempt really because
it is a word that's misused so bad.

539
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:53,640
I'd like to offer a technical definition
of it and then put it into relationship,

540
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:57,960
into proper relationship with what I 
already discussed.

541
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:00,563
If,
if hatred is the desire to CPA 

542
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,273
eliminated because of its catastrophe,
that blog is the desire to see being 

543
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,553
developed elevated maybe even because of
that suffering and to say that the 

544
00:37:15,331 --> 00:37:16,164
proper orientation in life is to work 
diligently for the alleviation of 

545
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:25,530
unnecessary suffering and to make that 
the core element of your being,

546
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,830
your actual aim.
Because you need a name,

547
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,870
everyone needs an aid.
We're we're,

548
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:31,920
we're,
we're,

549
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,510
we're creatures who are evolved to aim 
or hunters for that matter,

550
00:37:36,511 --> 00:37:40,600
and we need a target to a map.
We're not ever oriented properly without

551
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,240
name and then he might say,
well,

552
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,553
why not choose a name that is everything
that you could possibly wanted to be an 

553
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,890
and I would say that that is what you 
want to do because first of all,

554
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:58,460
being miserable and vulnerable and 
subject to catastrophe of decay.

555
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:03,870
It's easy to see st and to self contempt
and misery,

556
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:04,704
self-conscious misery,
and I think the only way out of that as 

557
00:38:07,681 --> 00:38:08,514
to
voluntarily shoulder a burden that the 

558
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,263
shouldering out brand students some 
respect for your own existence and so 

559
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:19,500
then you think,
well,

560
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,453
the way forward confidently is to find 
the biggest load that you can possibly 

561
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:29,590
lift and then lifted and then walk 
forward with it because they had.

562
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:34,930
You can see that there's something to 
you that transcends your vulnerability.

563
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,293
It knows the world and works against the
very terrible problems of suffering to 

564
00:38:44,361 --> 00:38:47,330
the level that might drive you to 
despair to begin with.

565
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:52,340
And so when I'm working with my clinical
clients,

566
00:38:52,341 --> 00:38:54,710
and I think when I'm speaking to people 
in general,

567
00:38:54,711 --> 00:38:56,120
when I'm properly oriented,

568
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:03,200
this is the development of thought that 
was originally laid down in part by Carl

569
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,033
Rogers,
so he was deeply influenced by by his 

570
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:10,640
Christian background.
He was a very famous psychologist and he

571
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,483
said that when you treat people in 
therapies with unconditional positive 

572
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:15,544
regard,
and I would say that that's unknowable 

573
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,913
formulation,
but it's erroneous because that isn't 

574
00:39:22,991 --> 00:39:23,824
exactly in my estimation what you should
do with people and I don't think it's 

575
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:28,234
what I do with people.
What do I do with people is to try to 

576
00:39:30,371 --> 00:39:31,204
find the part of the striving towards 
the light and that would like being 

577
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:35,914
itself to be elevated and unknowable and
suffering ameliorating especially the 

578
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:40,354
unnecessary suffering.
And then form an alliance with that and 

579
00:39:43,001 --> 00:39:45,340
communicate with that and encourage 
that.

580
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,203
Which is what I think you do to people 
that you love and you can't do that if 

581
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:50,584
there's bitterness in your heart because
that's actually the part that you want 

582
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:53,783
to destroy.

583
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:58,380
If you're bitter as the story of Cain 
and Abel tells us

584
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,773
in a carer in a terribly brief period of
time the terrible power you replaced 

585
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:11,410
contempt for being and resentment and 
hatred with,

586
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,813
with law,
and that's the desire to see the good 

587
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,193
flourish in you and others,
and I don't mean the good and that 

588
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:26,390
smarmy and contemptible manner that it's
often presented.

589
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:27,604
I'd been good as the combination of 
brilliant awareness and courage and 

590
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:33,814
strength that it really is
you would wish to bring forward at 

591
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:39,704
everyone to encourage and everyone if 
you were oriented properly in the world 

592
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,863
and to seek that kind of orientation is 
to ground yourself in love instead of 

593
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,200
Mephistophelean,
Patriot and

594
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,253
and

595
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,073
you have nothing better to do that now.
You might as well do the best that you 

596
00:40:59,351 --> 00:41:02,350
have to do because when you have to 
lose,

597
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,363
you're going to lose everything anyways.
So in the process of preparing to use 

598
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:08,944
everything,
you might as well risk everything you 

599
00:41:11,141 --> 00:41:16,141
have doing the best thing that you can 
possibly conceive of and there's no loss

600
00:41:16,621 --> 00:41:19,520
in that for you.
There's nothing but gain.

601
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,760
There's nothing but gain for everyone 
around you if you do that,

602
00:41:22,761 --> 00:41:27,410
and so why would you not do that?
Except for bitterness and resentment?

603
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:33,290
Perhaps luck,
a lack of confidence perhaps because you

604
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:36,240
haven't been encouraged properly and 
that's too bad.

605
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:44,130
That's a lot different than being 
empowered by the way to be encouraged.

606
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,733
It's a much better word.
So then I wrote the truth is the 

607
00:41:50,931 --> 00:41:55,340
handmaiden of love and what I meant by 
that because I've always wondered

608
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,733
knowing that
truth in love or perhaps the cardinal 

609
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:05,254
virtues,
what is the proper way of 

610
00:42:06,851 --> 00:42:07,684
conceptualizing the relationship?
And it seems to me that truth has to be 

611
00:42:10,811 --> 00:42:13,990
oriented towards something.
It needs a context.

612
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:18,100
There's no such thing as not in the way 
that I'm thinking of truth.

613
00:42:18,101 --> 00:42:22,840
There's no such thing as context free 
truth up in the moral domain,

614
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,693
not in the domain of action,
and that's the talking about truth in 

615
00:42:28,121 --> 00:42:28,954
action.

616
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:36,630
Truth is the handmaiden of law bicycles 
because having orienting yourself to the

617
00:42:36,641 --> 00:42:38,830
highest good that you could conceive,
whoa,

618
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:43,260
like Japan or wishing on the star and 
Oak Hill.

619
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:49,300
Then you speak truth with that 
orientation in mind.

620
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:55,740
Having the faith,
I suppose that because B is good,

621
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,083
articulating its nature as clearly as 
possible is the best way of continuing 

622
00:43:03,131 --> 00:43:06,220
to encourage that good to spring 
forward.

623
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,190
Otherwise you're presuming if you use 
deceit and falsehood,

624
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,053
that being is essentially corrupt 
because otherwise you wouldn't have to 

625
00:43:17,921 --> 00:43:20,980
falsify it in order to operate in the 
world.

626
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,680
So you could say,
well,

627
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,573
you could make the courageous assumption
that being is good despite I suppose 

628
00:43:30,281 --> 00:43:34,780
some evidence to the contrary and then 
take the great risk of speaking truth in

629
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:35,614
relationship to that under the 
assumption that whatever speaking truth 

630
00:43:40,421 --> 00:43:43,330
produces,
if it's oriented properly,

631
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,430
is good.

632
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,980
You have to make decisions like that in 
your life.

633
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,940
I mean,
I can give you a

634
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:56,423
simple example.
I suppose awhile back I was speaking at 

635
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,043
mcmaster university and there were a lot
of protesters there and that made me 

636
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:08,044
nervous because you never know when 
someone is going to do something 

637
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,753
unforgivably stupid.
And so far I've been fortunate that in 

638
00:44:16,381 --> 00:44:20,940
the controversies that I've been 
embroiled in that no one has done that.

639
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:26,210
They've pushed the edges of that but.
But they haven't done it and truly thank

640
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:31,110
God for that,
but having said that,

641
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:36,930
I wasn't upset by the presence of the 
protesters because I couldn't tell if in

642
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:39,180
fact they were.
There was a good thing or a bad thing.

643
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,030
It could be a good thing.
You couldn't be a bad thing.

644
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:46,680
It was a consequence of what I had been 
speaking up and that's what happened.

645
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:47,963
And so I thought there was no reason not
to let that play itself out because the 

646
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,710
end of the story has not yet been 
reached.

647
00:44:55,711 --> 00:45:00,540
And the meaning of the events could not 
yet be specified.

648
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:03,780
And you know,
sometimes in your family,

649
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:04,643
if you tell someone the truth,
and I don't mean I hope I've coined 

650
00:45:08,251 --> 00:45:10,140
this,
I don't mean black truths,

651
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:11,820
you know,
there's white lies.

652
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:17,360
It's in a way that I with to preserve a 
higher moral virtue,

653
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:20,540
you,
you continue to get lower moral virtue.

654
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:21,503
You know,
perhaps you don't tell a child dying of 

655
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:23,844
cancer that they're going to die.
I don't know because it depends very 

656
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:28,160
much on the particulars of the 
situation.

657
00:45:28,161 --> 00:45:31,710
But you can understand that you have 
mixed motives in a situation like that.

658
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:32,993
You can also speak black truths and 
black truth is when you say something 

659
00:45:36,031 --> 00:45:36,864
that's normally true,
but you're using it as a weapon for 

660
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:39,234
another purpose and that's the truth,
that's that's really more a more 

661
00:45:43,321 --> 00:45:44,154
profound an evil lie than any other one 
that you can possibly manage because 

662
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,020
you're using the truth in a way that 
corrupts.

663
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:53,850
It corrupts the truth itself and that's 
really reprehensible,

664
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:58,020
but barring the use of the block truth,
you know,

665
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:01,550
if within your family you say what you 
mean,

666
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:05,670
say what you think.
That can often cause tremendous upheaval

667
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,860
because,
well,

668
00:46:07,861 --> 00:46:12,861
because many relationships are cobbled 
together by various alliances of willful

669
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:18,520
blindness and things left unspoken and 
that's a very bad longterm strategy.

670
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,043
You know,
I've seen people who are embroiled in 

671
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:24,743
the death throes of a relationship that 
perhaps a crew 100,000 lies over its 

672
00:46:30,061 --> 00:46:33,010
course and became so unstable because of
that,

673
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:33,913
there is no hope for it.
Each of those lives was a forced stole 

674
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,173
opportunity to address something 
difficult with truth that was for gone 

675
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,003
and all that does is make those unsolved
problems accumulate and multiply and 

676
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:54,850
they eventually take over and attack and
generally when you're least expected.

677
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:56,183
And so if you speak the truth in your 
family cautiously and carefully and 

678
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:07,881
knowing that it could be wrong,
you will cause a that conflict,

679
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,433
but it's conceivable that that's the 
least amount about people in conflict 

680
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:17,603
that could exist to make things right.
And I believe that that is the case and 

681
00:47:24,221 --> 00:47:28,890
that one of the things that I tell 
people who are too agreeable,

682
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,093
let's say I don't like to cause conflict
and I actually don't like to cause 

683
00:47:33,911 --> 00:47:36,760
conflict because I'm more agreeable than
I should be.

684
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:39,603
Is that the ethical requirement to tell 
the truth trumps any desire to avoid 

685
00:47:44,591 --> 00:47:46,870
conflict.
And it's partly because

686
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:52,040
you only forestall the conflict and 
magnified.

687
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:57,390
There's no escaping it and it's better 
to engage in directly when it first with

688
00:47:57,971 --> 00:48:01,200
the necessity first arises then to 
forestall.

689
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:02,123
And so for people who are only too 
willing to make peace at the expense of 

690
00:48:07,361 --> 00:48:08,194
themselves,
let's say I try to encourage them to 

691
00:48:12,551 --> 00:48:13,384
generate conflict by telling the truth,
and I would say inevitably that has 

692
00:48:19,901 --> 00:48:24,901
nothing but beneficial medium to 
longterm consequences in their life,

693
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:29,800
even though it exposes them to more 
conflict in the short term.

694
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:35,430
It also alleviates their resentment 
because if someone has made me resentful

695
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:40,390
or if you become resentful because of 
someone's actions,

696
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,793
then there's only two real reasons why.
One is that you should pull up your 

697
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:48,004
socks and quit complaining.
Quit whining because you're being 

698
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:57,990
required to shoulder responsibility or 
you're being oppressed and tyrannized by

699
00:48:58,211 --> 00:49:03,211
someone who doesn't know where their 
proper limits are and in the former case

700
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,780
that you should get your act together 
and in the latter case,

701
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,900
you should stand up and stop that person
from encroaching upon you

702
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,880
so you speak truth in your family.

703
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,713
Let's say perhaps even to yourself at 
the risk of conflict and often severe 

704
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:26,730
conflict.
But the ultimate goal is to bring peace.

705
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:28,023
It's paradoxical because
we often don't think of a piece of 

706
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:34,360
something that's reached in conflict,
but that is precisely,

707
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:35,194
for example,
why we value free speech because the 

708
00:49:37,451 --> 00:49:38,284
wisdom of humanity and the wisest people
that we know that would include those 

709
00:49:41,831 --> 00:49:42,664
people who were intelligent enough to 
follow this country on the principles 

710
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:46,834
that is found on knew that whatever 
conflict free speech might produce pale 

711
00:49:52,601 --> 00:49:53,434
in comparison to the conflict that was 
generated by tyranny and repression of 

712
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,193
exchange of opinion,
and so it's never a matter of picking a 

713
00:50:02,171 --> 00:50:05,500
safe path because there's no such thing 
as a safe path.

714
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:06,603
It's only a matter of picking the path 
that produces the least catastrophe 

715
00:50:09,851 --> 00:50:14,740
possible and it's an.
It's an inviolable principle,

716
00:50:14,741 --> 00:50:15,574
I would say,
and also the fundamental principle of 

717
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:17,764
Western civilization that speech freely 
exchanged is the best pathway to peace 

718
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:24,634
and redemption that we have identified 
and so it should remain untrammeled 

719
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,830
under all circumstances possible.

720
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:34,723
Subject to very infrequent restraints of
the sort that are already encapsulated 

721
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,600
in law such that,
for example,

722
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:45,560
you cannot incite someone to criminal 
activity

723
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:54,320
humility.
Dialogue is the pathway.

724
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:56,960
You can truth.
Well,

725
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:57,853
I understand that you have to understand
why we fake and the reason we think is 

726
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,373
for the same reason that animals,
including us act and the reason that 

727
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:14,480
animals act is so that they can survive 
in the world.

728
00:51:14,481 --> 00:51:17,030
They do things so that they can survive 
in the world,

729
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:21,770
but the problem with doing things in the
world,

730
00:51:21,771 --> 00:51:26,771
the problem with acting in the world is 
that you can act in a manner that causes

731
00:51:28,071 --> 00:51:28,904
the substation of your Ba.
You can act in a manner that gets you 

732
00:51:31,101 --> 00:51:31,934
killed.
You can act in a manner that makes you 

733
00:51:33,261 --> 00:51:34,094
sick.
You can make a mistake and you pay for 

734
00:51:36,111 --> 00:51:37,990
that,
and that's the danger of acting.

735
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:43,060
So human beings have replaced near 
acting with thinking and what you do.

736
00:51:43,581 --> 00:51:48,581
What you think is you produced variance 
of yourself and you walk them through an

737
00:51:48,591 --> 00:51:49,424
imaginary time and a place and you know 
what happens to those imaginary 

738
00:51:53,331 --> 00:51:54,164
variants.
As they act out those particular 

739
00:51:57,111 --> 00:51:57,944
patterns of behavior and you know which 
ones get into trouble at which ones 

740
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:01,514
succeed and you let the ones that get 
into trouble die and you let ones that 

741
00:52:05,061 --> 00:52:05,894
succeed grip.
Hold of your behavior and act them out 

742
00:52:07,701 --> 00:52:08,534
in the world.
It was a brilliant innovation you might 

743
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:16,211
say on the part of our ancestors to grow
cognitive resources,

744
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:19,453
sophisticated enough to produce variance
of ourselves in a fictional space so 

745
00:52:24,771 --> 00:52:27,350
that our thoughts could die instead of 
us,

746
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:32,420
and so that's why we fail so that our 
thoughts can die instead of us,

747
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:38,290
and then the reason that we speak is to 
learn from other people's thoughts,

748
00:52:39,111 --> 00:52:39,944
but more than that,
it's that thinking individually is a 

749
00:52:45,981 --> 00:52:48,680
very limited process because you're 
ignorant,

750
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:53,420
which means you don't know everything 
and not only that bias in many,

751
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:56,930
many ways your bias by what you know and
what you don't know.

752
00:52:56,930 --> 00:53:01,250
You're biased by what assumed you're 
biased by how you deceive yourself.

753
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:05,360
You're biased by your temperament and 
your locale at your and your position in

754
00:53:05,361 --> 00:53:06,194
history.
All of these things make you a very 

755
00:53:07,461 --> 00:53:12,100
limited observer of the world,
and so I think as you like,

756
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,773
you can never think sufficiently.
And so what we do because of that is 

757
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:18,794
taught.
And so if I talk and I'm speaking 

758
00:53:21,651 --> 00:53:22,484
truthfully,
which means I'm telling you how things 

759
00:53:24,741 --> 00:53:25,574
appear to be to me,
that does not mean that I possess the 

760
00:53:28,501 --> 00:53:29,334
truth,
that means that I am saying as in an 

761
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:35,220
articulate manner as I possibly can,
how things appear to me,

762
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,113
that you can tell me how things appear 
to you and I could listen to you and 

763
00:53:39,211 --> 00:53:40,044
maybe you can tell me some things about 
how things appear that I don't already 

764
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:43,434
know.
And that's such a good deal because the 

765
00:53:45,361 --> 00:53:50,070
purpose of thinking is to let our 
thoughts die instead of us.

766
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,340
And if you can kill one of my thoughts 
because it's stupid,

767
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:57,450
then I don't have to act it out and die.
And so that's like a really good deal.

768
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:58,284
And so the reason that we engage in 
dialogue is so that we can take our 

769
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:04,213
thoughts that protect us from our own 
mortality and improve them and perhaps 

770
00:54:08,101 --> 00:54:11,370
improve the morale.
And there's just no loss in that.

771
00:54:11,371 --> 00:54:15,660
And so what that means in some senses 
that you can view everyone who disagrees

772
00:54:15,661 --> 00:54:18,000
with you as a source of potential 
wisdom.

773
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:20,190
Because if you talk to someone who 
agrees with you,

774
00:54:20,191 --> 00:54:22,990
all you're going to find out is what you
already know.

775
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:23,873
You already know that.
And if you talk to someone who doesn't 

776
00:54:26,191 --> 00:54:27,024
agree with you,
maybe one out of 10 things they say or 

777
00:54:30,151 --> 00:54:32,640
maybe one out of 100 things of God only 
knows,

778
00:54:32,641 --> 00:54:34,010
you know,
um,

779
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:36,710
maybe there is wise is you and they're 
perverse way.

780
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:37,883
You can discuss something with them and 
they'll tell you something you never 

781
00:54:40,561 --> 00:54:41,394
really thought of before and that'll 
just make some potentially miserable 

782
00:54:45,811 --> 00:54:46,644
event in your life that much less likely
and how good for you can that possibly 

783
00:54:50,101 --> 00:54:52,810
be in like.
I do believe that I've learned that.

784
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:53,783
I've talked to you a great variety of 
people and I don't care if people agree 

785
00:54:57,001 --> 00:54:58,020
with me.
In fact,

786
00:54:58,021 --> 00:54:58,854
generally speaking,
I find it more interesting if they 

787
00:55:00,451 --> 00:55:01,284
don't.
And I don't try to convince people 

788
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:07,970
because I don't believe that I have any 
right to determine their destiny.

789
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:11,490
And I don't want to be turned in their 
destiny because I don't know what's best

790
00:55:11,491 --> 00:55:12,324
for them.
And so I do listen to all sorts of 

791
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:20,540
strange and unlikely people and they 
tell me things that I don't know all the

792
00:55:20,581 --> 00:55:24,030
time and now it's just a spectacularly 
good deal.

793
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:24,953
And I decided a long time ago that one 
of the fundamental choices you make in 

794
00:55:28,441 --> 00:55:29,274
life is whether your
in love with what you know or in love 

795
00:55:34,861 --> 00:55:35,694
with what we don't know.
And I would say there's a lot more of 

796
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:40,800
what you don't know that there is what 
you know.

797
00:55:40,801 --> 00:55:41,634
And so it would be better to be in love 
with what you don't know because you 

798
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:49,500
don't know so much that if you could 
make friends with what you don't know,

799
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:51,780
then you're going to be continually 
enlightened.

800
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:57,120
And to be enlightened is to be engaged 
in the process of being enlightened.

801
00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:01,950
Not to be enlightened in any final sense
because that's just not possible.

802
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:06,080
So it's to act in a manner that 
continually in you.

803
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:07,003
And a huge part of that is humility.
And that's another word that's very 

804
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:14,330
difficult to use.
I would say like love because it's,

805
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:17,340
it's another word that's been both to 
death in some sense.

806
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:21,810
And it sounds like kind of cringing 
cowardice,

807
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:26,950
limitation,
but that's not what it means.

808
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:27,813
What it means is that you know that 
there isn't enough to you and you can 

809
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:35,350
tell if there isn't enough to you 
because your life isn't everything.

810
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:37,210
It could be.
That's the arrogance,

811
00:56:37,211 --> 00:56:38,044
right?
If your wife has everything you could 

812
00:56:39,191 --> 00:56:40,024
imagine it to be,
well then perhaps you don't need 

813
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:43,533
humility,
but since you're life is not everything 

814
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,233
you could imagine it to be,
you're deeply wrong about a lot of 

815
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,460
space,
and so since you're wrong,

816
00:56:51,461 --> 00:56:55,870
then you should be looking around for 
the opportunity to correct those errors.

817
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:56,733
Because why wouldn't you accept to 
protect your territory and that 

818
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:01,834
territory by definition,
give them the existence of your own 

819
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:05,283
suffering is insufficient,
so why are you playing to it so 

820
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,160
desperately?
It doesn't provide what you need or what

821
00:57:12,161 --> 00:57:12,994
you want and a transformation of it and 
the expansion and up and the refiguring 

822
00:57:17,831 --> 00:57:20,860
of it might be everything that you could
possibly want.

823
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:21,693
And so then you start to envision 
yourself instead of as the holder of a 

824
00:57:26,111 --> 00:57:26,944
piece of territory,
as the person who is attempting to 

825
00:57:31,121 --> 00:57:31,954
expand their capacity to act within all 
sorts of territories and exposure to 

826
00:57:37,331 --> 00:57:41,350
more people into more viewpoints,
especially with those people are telling

827
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,273
you the truth,
which they will do if you actually 

828
00:57:44,621 --> 00:57:45,454
listen to them,
then you can have your cake and eat it 

829
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:50,530
too.
That's a great deal.

830
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,393
And it's another way of reducing 
unnecessary suffering in the world by 

831
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:56,103
certainly reducing suffering and then 
perhaps learning to be how to be a 

832
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:01,953
greater use to people around you,
which again seems to be nothing but for 

833
00:58:05,771 --> 00:58:06,604
the good.

834
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:11,373
So humility is recognition of personal 
insufficiency and the willingness to 

835
00:58:15,221 --> 00:58:16,054
learn in order to overcome the 
insufficiency and then to learn is to 

836
00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:23,170
die voluntarily and be born again in 
great ways in small.

837
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:28,230
That's an archetypal idea at the basis 
of Western civilization is the idea that

838
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,213
the logos,
which is the capacity for truthful 

839
00:58:32,471 --> 00:58:33,304
stage,
is somehow associated with the act of 

840
00:58:36,581 --> 00:58:37,414
death and rebirth.
And there is multiple ways of 

841
00:58:41,201 --> 00:58:44,890
interpreting that idea.
And because I'm a psychologist,

842
00:58:44,891 --> 00:58:45,724
I tend to interpret it psychologically.
I don't claim that the psychological 

843
00:58:49,061 --> 00:58:53,110
interpretation exhausts the concept 
because I don't believe it does,

844
00:58:53,111 --> 00:58:58,111
but you see you are a certain way and 
some of that way is an error.

845
00:58:59,051 --> 00:59:03,130
And then when you learn them,
an error has taken place.

846
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:07,510
You have to let go of the conceptions 
that produced that error and that can be

847
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,520
very,
very painful.

848
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:12,880
For example,
you may have entered into a relationship

849
00:59:12,881 --> 00:59:15,740
that was pathological and you know it's 
about analytical.

850
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:16,583
What you're hooked into it in,
your emotions are hooked into it and 

851
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:21,650
you've configured your life around it.
And then in order to move forward,

852
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:22,693
you have to let go of that.
You have to admit to all the errors 

853
00:59:24,801 --> 00:59:25,634
you've made through the time was wasted 
and you have to allow a large part of 

854
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,233
himself to die.
Let's say you experienced in grief and 

855
00:59:33,411 --> 00:59:38,411
misery and sorrow and and and anxiety 
and sleepless nights and all of that.

856
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:42,850
But it's better than dying completely.
And what?

857
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:47,870
What that indicates is that every time 
you learned something large or small,

858
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:53,060
the part that was in the era prior to 
obtaining that bit of information has to

859
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,490
deteriorating,
disappeared.

860
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,413
There's pain associated with that,
but then there's the possibility for 

861
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,633
growth and transformation and one of the
most fundamental decisions that human 

862
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:06,644
beings made in their lives is whether or
not they're going to identify with what 

863
01:00:09,621 --> 01:00:10,454
they are or with what they could be and 
if they identify with what they could 

864
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:15,223
be,
then they have to continually let what 

865
01:00:16,431 --> 01:00:21,431
they are die so what they could come 
forward and so to learn is to dive.

866
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:23,443
Voluntarily,
have to be born again in great ways and 

867
01:00:25,341 --> 01:00:30,341
small.
So then I wrote,

868
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:33,523
yeah,
speech must be untrammeled so that 

869
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:41,650
dialogue can take place.
I think of the discussions that I've had

870
01:00:42,391 --> 01:00:43,224
with my wife and my kids,
but primarily with my wife who's a very 

871
01:00:49,501 --> 01:00:51,350
honest person.
In fact,

872
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:57,310
I've been married for 28 years.
I've known her for 45 years and I'm 55.

873
01:01:00,781 --> 01:01:01,614
It's a very long time.
We'd been friends with very long time 

874
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:08,890
and when she first came to be with me 30
years ago,

875
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,083
I was learning to some of the things 
that I've talked to you about tonight 

876
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,930
and I told her that if we were going to 
be together

877
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:22,350
that she would have to tell the truth 
because if you didn't tell the truth and

878
01:01:22,351 --> 01:01:23,184
I wouldn't know who she was and I 
wouldn't know where we were and I 

879
01:01:26,401 --> 01:01:27,234
wouldn't be able to solve any problems 
and neither would she because we'd be 

880
01:01:29,551 --> 01:01:32,220
living a fictional relationship with one
another.

881
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:37,140
That struck me as a very bad idea,
and so she took that to heart.

882
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:38,423
I would say.
I would also say it's like the more 

883
01:01:40,111 --> 01:01:45,111
honest person than me
and I'm not claiming claiming to be

884
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:52,880
morally virtuous at any particular.
I'm aware why multitude of faults,

885
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:58,660
but the fact she has ripped so tightly 
onto the truth means that if I ever have

886
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:03,400
a problem that I can talk to her and I 
know what she thinks.

887
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:06,610
She doesn't tell me that she's right.
We've learned that you know,

888
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,210
because to tell someone the truth does 
not mean to play that you're correct.

889
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:11,373
It only is to claim that you're trying 
to communicate the way things look to 

890
01:02:15,731 --> 01:02:20,160
you as clearly as possible and that 
you're open to the of correction,

891
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:21,373
right?
Because if someone can tell you how 

892
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:25,210
you're wrong precisely exactly how 
you're wrong,

893
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:26,093
that's such a gift.
If someone is willing to tell you the 

894
01:02:27,991 --> 01:02:28,824
truth,
then you have the possibility of 

895
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:31,014
learning from them and then you have two
grades instead of one and that's a good 

896
01:02:34,891 --> 01:02:37,650
deal and that's actually the spiritual 
purpose of marriage,

897
01:02:37,651 --> 01:02:38,484
let's say,
is to produce a union between two 

898
01:02:40,531 --> 01:02:41,364
people.
It's predicated upon the truth so that 

899
01:02:42,901 --> 01:02:43,734
the information flow between the kid 
maximize and so that they can both be 

900
01:02:47,071 --> 01:02:47,904
elevated above the,
the the restrictions of their own 

901
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:58,200
solitary bias existence and that 
facilitates.

902
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:03,690
That produces the proper environment for
children because then the child children

903
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:05,690
don't face the father or the mother.

904
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:06,543
They faced the union of the father and 
the mother and that's an inviolable 

905
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:14,970
forest and the children will attempt to 
play one person off against the other.

906
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,440
Because they're tricky because they're 
human and they're full of trouble.

907
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,880
They're very good at poking and prodding
and manipulating and invest in,

908
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:25,403
but they want to hit a wall.
They want to hit a wall that doesn't 

909
01:03:27,301 --> 01:03:28,134
move because that makes them secure and 
if you have a relationship that's based 

910
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:33,174
on truth,
then you can talk about how it is that 

911
01:03:35,341 --> 01:03:37,380
you should meet with your children,
for example,

912
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:38,243
and you can agree upon it,
and then when the children push the 

913
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:41,124
limits as they inevitably will,
they don't find something spongy and 

914
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:49,130
dictate and eat a find something that's 
strong and sturdy and it's a wall and of

915
01:03:49,891 --> 01:03:52,620
course they can't move through the wall 
and that's frustrating,

916
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:53,454
but then they're protected by the wall 
and that stops them from being anxious 

917
01:03:57,450 --> 01:03:59,490
beyond their capacity to bear.

918
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:00,803
And so that structure that's brought 
about by truthful communication builds 

919
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:04,974
the walls around children that allow 
them to play freely and expand 

920
01:04:08,251 --> 01:04:10,620
themselves and exist properly in the 
world.

921
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:16,010
And so speech must be untraveled so that
dialogue can take place.

922
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:18,090
It's the only.
If you talk to me,

923
01:04:18,091 --> 01:04:21,290
I want to know what you think.
I don't say I don't agree with it.

924
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:22,163
If you disagree with me,
I'm going to fight with every bit of 

925
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:30,450
power at my disposal to determine who is
correct.

926
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:31,463
Well simultaneously recognizing that 
it's possible that it's you and not me 

927
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,153
and I'm not going to risk undergoing the
small or large death that I have to 

928
01:04:41,701 --> 01:04:42,534
undergo.
If I find out that you're right without 

929
01:04:44,611 --> 01:04:45,444
being convinced that you're right,
so I'm learned to hit him with 

930
01:04:47,671 --> 01:04:52,320
everything I've got,
but part of that is also a quote that if

931
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:53,243
I'm wrong,
you will provide me with a better 

932
01:04:54,571 --> 01:04:58,650
argument than the one I already have and
that will make me better armed when I go

933
01:04:58,651 --> 01:05:03,030
out into the world.
And so there's utility in neat,

934
01:05:03,031 --> 01:05:08,031
defeated by a skillful opponent and my 
wife is precisely that sort of opponent.

935
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,233
Also has the addition,
remarkable talent of being able to 

936
01:05:11,821 --> 01:05:15,540
string together a list,
a vicious insults,

937
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:16,403
one after the other,
like one I have ever encountered in my 

938
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:19,624
life.

939
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:28,150
It's quite comical because sometimes 
when we're embroiled in conflict,

940
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,050
she'll start to do that and say 
something so outrageous,

941
01:05:32,051 --> 01:05:36,940
so absolutely beyond the Pale that he'll
make me laugh and crack up,

942
01:05:36,941 --> 01:05:37,774
and then of course that's great,
useful because if there is something 

943
01:05:40,901 --> 01:05:41,734
ridiculous about quieting and that 
always brings to mind and when she does 

944
01:05:46,091 --> 01:05:46,924
that,
then I'm reminded why I liked her so 

945
01:05:48,071 --> 01:05:48,904
much back then and still do because it's
something to see someone with that kind 

946
01:05:52,391 --> 01:05:55,450
of at spirit,
that solar array for that,

947
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:57,063
so speech must be untrammeled so that 
dialogue can take place so that we can 

948
01:06:01,211 --> 01:06:03,430
all humbly learn.
Well.

949
01:06:03,431 --> 01:06:04,264
That's the other element of humility is 
that humility is a precondition for 

950
01:06:06,971 --> 01:06:08,350
learning.
Right,

951
01:06:08,351 --> 01:06:11,980
and you have to be open to the 
possibility that you don't know what you

952
01:06:11,981 --> 01:06:13,180
need to know.
That's the thing.

953
01:06:13,181 --> 01:06:14,014
It's not that you don't know everything 
because obviously you don't know 

954
01:06:15,971 --> 01:06:18,400
everything,
but it's more specific than that is that

955
01:06:18,401 --> 01:06:21,040
you may not know what you need to know.

956
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,740
Sometime in your life was going to be a 
piece of information.

957
01:06:23,741 --> 01:06:24,574
That's pretty sure it'll be in a 
negotiation or maybe in a medical 

958
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:31,860
decision or or maybe relationship 
decision or an art or in a,

959
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:33,510
in a complex,
in a,

960
01:06:33,511 --> 01:06:34,344
in a,
in a complex tense situation with 

961
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:40,810
urgency and danger and you'll need a 
tool and then in there or things will go

962
01:06:40,811 --> 01:06:45,811
badly for you and you won't have it 
because there was an opportunity at some

963
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:46,834
point in your life where have you been 
slightly more humbled you would have 

964
01:06:49,481 --> 01:06:50,314
learned,
you would have learned how to formulate 

965
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:56,860
and and utilize that tool right then and
there and you didn't,

966
01:06:56,861 --> 01:06:58,010
and that left you.
I know,

967
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:04,140
and the thing is that your most powerful
arms are your words by any,

968
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:10,950
by any measure and the opportunity that 
you have to sharpen your capacity to use

969
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:16,861
your words through dialogue,
which is why space is cannot be safe for

970
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:18,970
any length of time.

971
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,273
It's because of the safer the space is 
made now that more dangerous the space 

972
01:07:23,161 --> 01:07:23,994
is made in the future and that's 
something that people are unwilling to 

973
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:29,163
understand it because they don't want to
face the fundamental truth that life is 

974
01:07:31,961 --> 01:07:34,060
suffering.
There's no real escape from it,

975
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,313
and so they make artificial spaces where
people could delude themselves 

976
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:41,650
temporarily into naive again that life 
can be made safe,

977
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:45,270
would in fact the best you could do is 
arm people to move forward in the past.

978
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,113
When you do that is to test them with 
combat at every opportunity that you 

979
01:07:49,421 --> 01:07:50,254
have to do that with the most carefully 
crafted arguments at your disposal and 

980
01:07:53,921 --> 01:07:56,980
to teach them to stand up and defend 
their thoughts so that when they entered

981
01:07:56,981 --> 01:07:57,814
the real world and they're challenged,
they know how to stand up forthrightly 

982
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,760
instead of crying and running home.

983
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:10,850
Thank

984
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:23,440
so that we can all humbling so that 
truth conserved love.

985
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:27,500
Well,
that's the goal is to

986
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:34,790
inform yourself and that's a good word 
to inform yourself.

987
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:35,624
It's.
It's of course the short form of 

988
01:08:37,221 --> 01:08:38,054
information and I really liked that word
because it breaks into in formation and 

989
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,620
something information is formed 
properly.

990
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:46,431
Ambien,
the order.

991
01:08:46,431 --> 01:08:48,800
It's information,
right?

992
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:53,810
It's everything is aligned and moving in
the same way like an army of information

993
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,760
and so if you expose yourself to 
information,

994
01:08:56,810 --> 01:09:01,810
you get informed and we put yourself 
information and then your crystalline in

995
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:06,950
your structure and and and and difficult
to contend with and that's what you want

996
01:09:06,951 --> 01:09:08,930
to be.
That's the thing to be.

997
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:09,973
And you do that by
learning humbling and that once you are 

998
01:09:15,411 --> 01:09:20,030
in Toronto than your capacity to speak 
properly and to formulate your arguments

999
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:20,864
and to negotiate and to formulate 
problems and to formulate solutions and 

1000
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:28,280
to seek consensus makes you powerful 
enough.

1001
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:32,240
Not so much that tragedy stays away from
you because it can't,

1002
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:33,083
but so that when tragedy does come along
and perhaps even when malevolence comes 

1003
01:09:37,191 --> 01:09:38,024
along that you'll be maximally prepared 
for it and we'll be able to deal with 

1004
01:09:41,151 --> 01:09:41,984
it.
Which is what you have to do as a human 

1005
01:09:43,191 --> 01:09:45,920
being.
Because there is in fact no avoiding it.

1006
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:50,000
And so what you do with someone that you
love as you make them strong,

1007
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:50,893
you do not tell them that the world's 
safe and that they're secure and that 

1008
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:59,480
there's nothing there to get the.
Because there is everything there to get

1009
01:09:59,481 --> 01:10:00,314
the

1010
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,393
and so the best you can do is strengthen
them and that's what a college is 

1011
01:10:05,891 --> 01:10:09,700
supposed to do and that's where the 
university is supposed to do and I would

1012
01:10:09,701 --> 01:10:13,540
say that the colleges and the 
universities are increasingly failing on

1013
01:10:13,541 --> 01:10:14,374
both of those fronts and it might be 
said that that's isolated only to the 

1014
01:10:18,161 --> 01:10:18,994
colleges and universities,
but we should remember that those are 

1015
01:10:21,341 --> 01:10:22,174
the storehouses of our cultural 
knowledge and the generators of the new 

1016
01:10:26,291 --> 01:10:27,124
leaders and if the university's falter 
and that's particularly true of the 

1017
01:10:30,191 --> 01:10:31,024
humanities,
then that falter and undermines the 

1018
01:10:33,011 --> 01:10:36,250
entire culture.
Perhaps the entire civilization,

1019
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:37,203
and I do believe that we are in the 
process of doing precisely that now and 

1020
01:10:42,011 --> 01:10:47,011
I don't think that what I did six months
ago and the creating of these two little

1021
01:10:47,561 --> 01:10:48,394
videos complaining about a rather 
obscure piece of legislation in the 

1022
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:52,714
rather tiny and insignificant country 
would have the track that the attention 

1023
01:10:57,430 --> 01:11:00,430
that it did attract.
If it was only about pronouns.

1024
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:04,180
It's certainly not only about pronouns.
In fact,

1025
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:09,040
it's not about pronouns at all.
So the truth can serve low.

1026
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:09,874
Oh,

1027
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:14,580
well you want to articulate

1028
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:17,280
yourself and you want to be information 
so that

1029
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:21,660
you can formulate your existence.
You

1030
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:24,083
generate your narrative.
You could take your position in the 

1031
01:11:26,221 --> 01:11:27,054
world forthrightly and and with the 
capacity to intimidate when necessary 

1032
01:11:32,041 --> 01:11:35,460
and with the capacity to be a monster 
when necessary,

1033
01:11:35,461 --> 01:11:36,294
have to be civilized and unnecessary and
there was nothing in that that making 

1034
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:41,213
yourself sharper or improve to make 
yourself sharper is to carry a sharper 

1035
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:49,410
sort.
Of course in these days with the highest

1036
01:11:49,411 --> 01:11:53,610
virtue is harmlessness message like that
seems positive reverse,

1037
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,473
but it's completely wrong.
This is why I think my talks attracts 

1038
01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:00,780
men,
is that a woman who hates,

1039
01:12:00,781 --> 01:12:04,020
he wants to castrate you and make you 
safe that way,

1040
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:04,883
but a woman who loves you and wants to 
make you incredibly powerful and wise 

1041
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:08,873
because then your housekeeper 
destruction is regulated in that manner 

1042
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:13,133
and you're still good for something and 
so that would be the optimal solution 

1043
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:20,010
rather than merely weakening and 
destroying.

1044
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:24,000
And I think we've had plenty of that.
You've had more than enough,

1045
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:29,390
and I know as well,
but women who have their souls intact,

1046
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:34,500
I would rather have monstrous man who 
were civilized and cringing milk sops,

1047
01:12:34,501 --> 01:12:36,360
who were harmless but good for nothing.

1048
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,920
Thank you.

1049
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:51,570
Most women already have enough children 
to take care of.

1050
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:01,380
So the truth conserved love so that 
suffering can be ameliorated.

1051
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:03,740
Well,
obviously that's the goal.

1052
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:04,613
No,
I,

1053
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:05,453
I hear people all the time who are 
possessed by a certain nihilism of 

1054
01:13:08,911 --> 01:13:13,911
spirit and that's not surprising.
The understructure of the foundations of

1055
01:13:13,951 --> 01:13:14,784
our cultural to be severely assaulted.
I would say there were under tremendous 

1056
01:13:20,581 --> 01:13:23,850
assault.
That's a process that has been unfolding

1057
01:13:23,851 --> 01:13:27,450
for very many years perhaps since the 
development of empirical science,

1058
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,880
which is,
which is one of the contributing factors

1059
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,950
because it's undermined our faith in 
our,

1060
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:36,160
in our traditional religious viewpoints.
There was structure our,

1061
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:39,600
our moral behaviors or decisions about 
value.

1062
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:40,913
There's many other reasons why the 
foundations upon which Western 

1063
01:13:44,491 --> 01:13:47,750
civilization rests are under assault.
Um,

1064
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:51,410
and because of that,
it's easy to be uncertain and to say,

1065
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:53,340
well,
what is the meaning of life?

1066
01:13:53,341 --> 01:13:56,310
There is nothing to life.
There's rolling,

1067
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,353
rolling significant,
and there's nothing but suffering and 

1068
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:03,050
why should I do anything in the face of 
all?

1069
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:04,980
I would say,
well,

1070
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:05,873
we can take that.
Part of that is a fundamental truth is 

1071
01:14:08,371 --> 01:14:11,890
that the fact that life is suffering is 
a meeting.

1072
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:16,160
It's a meeting that no amount of 
rational argumentation we'll,

1073
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,720
uh,
will,

1074
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:19,840
will rescue you from.
In fact,

1075
01:14:19,841 --> 01:14:24,220
the more nihilistic you come,
the more the fact that life is suffering

1076
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:27,850
becomes self evident.
It's almost as if he was trying to teach

1077
01:14:27,851 --> 01:14:30,610
you something and it is trying to teach 
you something.

1078
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,473
It's trying to teach you that you cannot
argue with your way of suffering and so 

1079
01:14:34,811 --> 01:14:36,790
then you might as well do something 
about it.

1080
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:38,170
And then I would say,
well,

1081
01:14:38,171 --> 01:14:41,080
that's where you can find the meaning.
It's very straightforward.

1082
01:14:41,081 --> 01:14:44,770
There's suffering in the world and much 
of it is aborad and,

1083
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:45,830
and,
and,

1084
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:49,990
and unacceptable to anyone who attends 
to it.

1085
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:55,050
Anyone looks at it and the right answer 
to a child who's,

1086
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:02,360
who's been beaten and abused is not
who's going to care in a million years.

1087
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,180
But what can I do to stop that right 
now?

1088
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,033
And the nihilistic response that 
everything is insignificant means that 

1089
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:14,500
the pain of children,
for example,

1090
01:15:14,501 --> 01:15:15,334
is insignificant.
And that seems to be to me close enough 

1091
01:15:19,391 --> 01:15:22,450
to self evidently wrong so that it's an 
argument.

1092
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:23,284
15 just be dispensed with.
And so I might say to people who are 

1093
01:15:26,681 --> 01:15:27,514
wondering where to look for the meaning 
in their life is to take the self 

1094
01:15:31,170 --> 01:15:34,270
evident phenomena of,
of phenomenon,

1095
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:35,493
of suffering seriously,
and to orient themselves as rapidly as 

1096
01:15:38,561 --> 01:15:39,394
possible towards its amelioration and to
work diligently towards that and for a 

1097
01:15:43,961 --> 01:15:44,794
number of years.
And then to reevaluate the wife at the 

1098
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:50,410
end of that and see if they think any 
differently about the world because they

1099
01:15:50,411 --> 01:15:51,244
certainly will.
And so the nihilistic argument to me 

1100
01:15:54,911 --> 01:15:59,911
seems remarkably weak both on its space 
and in depth because there are things to

1101
01:16:01,121 --> 01:16:05,440
be done and the things that need to be 
done are obvious to anyone who will open

1102
01:16:05,441 --> 01:16:06,940
their eyes and look at them.

1103
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:08,450
And so then I would say,
well,

1104
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,333
open your eyes and look what needs to be
done immediately around you and do it 

1105
01:16:12,751 --> 01:16:16,920
and keep doing that and keep doing it.
And then you'll find that the APP,

1106
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:17,793
the questions,
the answers to the questions that you 

1107
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:23,350
have been paralyzed you for so many 
years,

1108
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:28,120
will manifest themselves to you clearly 
enough so that you won't have to believe

1109
01:16:28,121 --> 01:16:28,954
that because they will be self evident 
so that suffering can be ameliorated so 

1110
01:16:34,391 --> 01:16:36,970
that we can all stumble forward.
Well,

1111
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:37,863
why I stumbled well,
that's because we stumbled when we move 

1112
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:42,573
forward because we don't know everything
and so we moved forward in error 

1113
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:49,990
constantly,
which is why we need to speak with other

1114
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:50,853
people,
can listen so that we don't stumble and 

1115
01:16:53,561 --> 01:16:54,394
fall and be unable to arise and so we 
stumbled forward because forward 

1116
01:17:00,431 --> 01:17:01,264
movement is necessary to human beings 
and forward movement implies that there 

1117
01:17:05,111 --> 01:17:10,111
is something better to go to and there 
is something better to go to the that is

1118
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:14,053
at least a world where there is the 
least amount of suffering that is 

1119
01:17:19,341 --> 01:17:22,310
commensurate with the existence of the 
world.

1120
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:27,490
And I would say that we have ameliorated
a substantial amount of suffering in the

1121
01:17:27,801 --> 01:17:28,634
20th century.
We're doing a very good job of doing 

1122
01:17:30,441 --> 01:17:33,140
such things as combating absolutely 
already.

1123
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,273
You may or may not know that every 
single day about 150,000 people 

1124
01:17:37,971 --> 01:17:38,804
worldwide are lifted out of absolute 
poverty and about 300,000 people are 

1125
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:47,630
attached to the electrical grid that we 
have.

1126
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:48,523
We have the enriching the bottom segment
of the world's population for the last 

1127
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:53,534
15 years at a rate.
It's absolutely unprecedented in human 

1128
01:17:56,931 --> 01:17:57,764
history and that makes me wonder just 
how well we could do if everyone really 

1129
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:06,830
put their shoulders to the wheel and 
pushed and so if we did that together,

1130
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:10,910
then perhaps we won't degenerate into 
absolute chaos,

1131
01:18:10,911 --> 01:18:15,830
which is certainly something that learns
now and is a real threat.

1132
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,560
We're at a crisis point as far as I can 
tell,

1133
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:23,000
and we need to determine whether we want
everything to go to hell,

1134
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:23,863
which it certainly could and I wouldn't 
recommend that or whether or not we can 

1135
01:18:27,351 --> 01:18:28,340
work together.

1136
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:29,683
And that brings me to the last line,
which is that so that we can all 

1137
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:38,740
stumbled forward to the Kingdom of God.
And why do I put it that way?

1138
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:41,210
And the reason I put it that way is 
because.

1139
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:42,111
Well,
first of all,

1140
01:18:42,111 --> 01:18:42,944
everybody does really know what that 
means even though they may not believe 

1141
01:18:45,771 --> 01:18:47,670
in it,
but that doesn't really matter.

1142
01:18:47,671 --> 01:18:48,504
I mean,
I think that to believe is to act and 

1143
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,273
not to spout a set of statements and it 
is certainly possible to act as if what 

1144
01:18:57,951 --> 01:18:58,784
you were attempting to do is bring about
the Kingdom of God and I would say that 

1145
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:02,833
doing so is something that will 
radically justify your miserable 

1146
01:19:05,631 --> 01:19:06,464
existence and that's really what you 
need is radical justification for your 

1147
01:19:10,731 --> 01:19:11,564
miserable existence.
And because human beings are so 

1148
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:17,030
powerful,
really powerful beyond the limits of our

1149
01:19:17,031 --> 01:19:17,864
imagination,
we have no idea what our ultimate 

1150
01:19:19,491 --> 01:19:20,840
destiny might be.

1151
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:23,990
That it's not unclear what our limits 
are.

1152
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:28,400
That if we decided to improve the place,
let's say,

1153
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:29,293
and I would say starting with ourselves 
because that is the safest and humblest 

1154
01:19:32,931 --> 01:19:34,310
way to begin.
That.

1155
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:35,144
There's no telling where we might end up
and since we're all fragile and 

1156
01:19:38,931 --> 01:19:42,140
vulnerable creatures and we're going to 
lose everything anyways.

1157
01:19:42,141 --> 01:19:46,820
We might as well risk everything to 
obtain the highest possible good,

1158
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:47,743
and then that will make the mystery that
constitutes our life bearable as a 

1159
01:19:51,141 --> 01:19:51,974
consequence of our intrinsic nobility 
and there's nothing in that accept the 

1160
01:19:56,781 --> 01:19:57,614
good and so then why not do it,
and so that's what I would enjoy and 

1161
01:20:03,891 --> 01:20:08,891
encourage,
encourage everyone to do because there's

1162
01:20:09,151 --> 01:20:13,980
nothing better to do than now and we 
might as well all do that,

1163
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:16,050
which there is nothing better than that.

1164
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:22,480
Thank you

1165
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:33,520
and so all repeat the outline

1166
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,233
and then

1167
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:40,543
no,
I was talking about the boundaries of 

1168
01:20:43,221 --> 01:20:44,054
free speech and I believe that speech 
should be untrammeled because it's too 

1169
01:20:48,231 --> 01:20:52,550
dangerous with counseling does not mean 
that.

1170
01:20:52,551 --> 01:20:57,170
I believe that speech free speech comes 
without responsibility.

1171
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:58,933
I believe quite the contrary.
The free speech carries with it the 

1172
01:21:01,731 --> 01:21:02,564
highest responsibility because you went 
right to speak and wish to shoulder the 

1173
01:21:08,901 --> 01:21:09,734
responsibility of speaking.
Then you have to contend with the fact 

1174
01:21:12,831 --> 01:21:13,664
that your words are the force that 
shapes the world and that with every 

1175
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:18,643
word you utter things tilt slightly 
heavenward or slightly pell word and 

1176
01:21:23,731 --> 01:21:24,564
that that responsibility rests firmly on
your shoulders and it's inescapable and 

1177
01:21:30,411 --> 01:21:31,244
that's a terrible thing to realize is a 
very meaningful thing to realize and 

1178
01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:38,270
people saying that they would like their
life to be meaningful,

1179
01:21:38,271 --> 01:21:43,271
but that's a questionable claim because 
to recognize your life is meaningful,

1180
01:21:44,061 --> 01:21:44,894
is to understand that everything you do 
matters and that what it means for 

1181
01:21:47,961 --> 01:21:52,961
things to matter is that you're deciding
in some sense between heaven on earth,

1182
01:21:53,210 --> 01:21:57,710
hell on earth with every decision that 
you make and the decisions that you make

1183
01:21:57,740 --> 01:21:58,573
echo far beyond you in ways that are 
almost incomprehensible and the destiny 

1184
01:22:02,601 --> 01:22:03,434
of the world is determined by the 
collective decisions of all the 

1185
01:22:07,491 --> 01:22:11,540
individuals that make up the world and 
that we're all locked together.

1186
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:16,030
Deciding in which metaphysical direction
our little planet will

1187
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:18,130
we'll go.

1188
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,500
So free speech carries with it heavy 
responsibility,

1189
01:22:22,501 --> 01:22:23,334
but the responsibility is something you 
want because it justifies suffering of 

1190
01:22:26,491 --> 01:22:29,100
existence.
Said life is suffering.

1191
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:34,590
Love is the desire to see necessary 
suffering.

1192
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:39,370
Meliorative truth is the handmaid of 
love.

1193
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:45,980
Dialogue is the pathway to truth,
humility,

1194
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:49,093
that's recognition of personal 
insufficiency and the willingness to 

1195
01:22:52,431 --> 01:22:53,264
learn
to learn is to dive voluntarily and to 

1196
01:22:58,631 --> 01:23:00,760
be born again in great ways in small

1197
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:01,633
Paul,

1198
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:06,160
so speech must be untrammeled so that 
dialogue

1199
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:06,993
can take place so that we can all humbly
learn so that truth can serve law so 

1200
01:23:12,161 --> 01:23:17,161
that suffering can be ameliorated so 
that we can all step forward towards the

1201
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:19,983
Kingdom of God.
Thank you for inviting me to 

1202
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:28,450
Mcminnville.
Thanks.

1203
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:57,603
Now we'd like to take the opportunity to
open things up for questions to answer 

1204
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:11,930
and what we might do here.
Obviously

1205
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:18,680
a the person in the
simple answer your questions.

1206
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:33,130
Thanks
for everything you said.

1207
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:38,703
Excuse me.
I've ever had the opportunity to see so 

1208
01:24:44,531 --> 01:24:49,480
many people in here
and he knew of test,

1209
01:24:49,481 --> 01:24:51,370
validated.
My whole exists.

1210
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:56,490
To thank is we're working importantly in
India

1211
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:11,040
and we're alone and we're.
We don't eat together.

1212
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:13,803
It's like a death trap.
Medicare bringing people together is a 

1213
01:25:16,481 --> 01:25:21,481
monster.
What is it that people are resonating to

1214
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:23,163
that we can use that will bring people 
together so that we can talk about 

1215
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:31,831
solutions?
No.

1216
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:49,740
I watched this Netflix special with 
Russell Peters and Russell Peters,

1217
01:25:50,981 --> 01:25:53,380
for those of you who don't know is a 
Canadian comic.

1218
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:54,473
He's of Indian descent.
He was raised in a suburb in Toronto 

1219
01:25:59,290 --> 01:26:04,290
which makes them acutely or culinary 
Canadian and he's very

1220
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:09,980
similar to the Canadian culture and 
Russell has made his living

1221
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:12,763
insulting every racial and ethnic group 
that he could possibly insulted and so 

1222
01:26:17,181 --> 01:26:22,181
interesting because he filled up an 
entire arena in London.

1223
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:27,410
I think it was the most people that have
ever gathered together to see a comedian

1224
01:26:27,411 --> 01:26:30,500
before and it was a United Nations in 
the.

1225
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:31,663
In the arena.
The Arabs were there and the and the 

1226
01:26:34,881 --> 01:26:38,750
Jews were there and the Russians were 
there in the south.

1227
01:26:38,751 --> 01:26:39,584
Americans were there and every group was
waiting with their tongues out so that 

1228
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:45,163
Russell could insult their particular 
ethnicity so that they could feel 

1229
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:53,980
finally that someone was saying 
something that was truthful and not hide

1230
01:26:53,981 --> 01:26:58,981
it and to say it openly in some sense 
and to make light of it and we would say

1231
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:03,043
you bring people together by
telling them what you think without 

1232
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:11,120
manipulation,
without care for the outcome,

1233
01:27:11,610 --> 01:27:12,443
and people can hear the very rough terms
if they trust who's stating the heaters 

1234
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:21,890
is trusted by everyone because he's,
I suppose

1235
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:28,620
non discriminant prejudice.
He hates everyone equally.

1236
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,850
There's nothing behind his assaults 
except

1237
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:37,193
the desire for everyone to come together
in recognition of their idiocy and 

1238
01:27:40,011 --> 01:27:45,011
vulnerability of people very much enjoy 
that and so I would say you unite people

1239
01:27:45,561 --> 01:27:46,394
to the degree that they can be united by
saying what you think without trying to 

1240
01:27:50,151 --> 01:27:50,984
manipulate the outcome,
and so that's a better way to live 

1241
01:27:54,231 --> 01:27:57,750
anyways because you don't have to keep 
track of anything that way.

1242
01:27:57,980 --> 01:28:01,370
Not so nice.
Say what you think carefully.

1243
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:02,473
You observed the response and adjust 
your behavior and and everyone likes 

1244
01:28:07,101 --> 01:28:11,690
that.
So I don't know a better way of doing,

1245
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:13,100
of doing it now,

1246
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:14,913
so
I'm an author and a biologist and I was 

1247
01:28:29,691 --> 01:28:34,691
researching
district keep disturbing.

1248
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:42,900
It was written by
and the Irish.

1249
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,660
It's a peculiar,
neither

1250
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:54,800
exceed
because it voted so much energy

1251
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:03,560
and the author took this and her 
proposition was

1252
01:29:07,770 --> 01:29:10,570
so
full

1253
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:17,270
of basically
and

1254
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:25,120
the brain
as much of a

1255
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:28,993
race.

1256
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:48,790
Well,
that's a cool question.

1257
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:55,090
I think that you retool the story of the
fall genesis,

1258
01:29:56,610 --> 01:30:01,090
you see,
I mean that because as far as I can tell

1259
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:02,093
that story means is that at some,
at some point in time people became 

1260
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:13,080
conceptually sophisticated enough to 
understand their own vulnerability,

1261
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:15,213
to realize their own native units.
Do you discovered the path to discover 

1262
01:30:18,671 --> 01:30:19,504
the necessity of work and to be blown 
out of that preconscious paradise into 

1263
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:25,413
the tragic believe history.
I believe that's what that story means 

1264
01:30:29,830 --> 01:30:34,090
and you can read that as a tragic 
catastrophe with no solution.

1265
01:30:35,170 --> 01:30:36,730
And I would say though,
however,

1266
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:40,000
that since that time and God only knows 
when that was,

1267
01:30:40,630 --> 01:30:41,463
the human race has been collectively 
attempting to address the problem and 

1268
01:30:45,671 --> 01:30:48,670
the solution that's emerged is something
like,

1269
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:54,210
although a little bit of excess 
consciousness demolish us,

1270
01:30:55,480 --> 01:31:00,480
a lot more consciousness could save us,
and I think that that's the case.

1271
01:31:02,050 --> 01:31:04,150
There's no going back,
right?

1272
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:07,000
Alcohol makes you unconscious,
for example,

1273
01:31:07,001 --> 01:31:07,834
when that's part of why people like it 
then it's not surprising sedatives to 

1274
01:31:11,401 --> 01:31:12,234
the APP,
the things that people do to themselves 

1275
01:31:14,711 --> 01:31:17,620
to destroy your consciousness by 
distraction,

1276
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:18,693
do that,
alleviate the terrible catastrophe of 

1277
01:31:21,881 --> 01:31:26,680
being morally that is easy to bear,
but it's the wrong solution.

1278
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:32,080
The right solution is to be even more 
awake and to pay even more attention and

1279
01:31:32,081 --> 01:31:37,081
there's a way out the problem that way.
And so the fall,

1280
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:39,303
the idea of the fall indicates something
about people that's irredeemably 

1281
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:44,590
damaged.
Well perhaps not redeemable,

1282
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:47,520
serious,
right?

1283
01:31:47,530 --> 01:31:48,950
There's this schism,
Mba,

1284
01:31:49,010 --> 01:31:54,010
let's say that's not easy to rectify.
What historic indicates,

1285
01:31:55,270 --> 01:31:56,103
and I think it's tightly tied with the 
kind of evolutionary process that were 

1286
01:31:59,741 --> 01:32:00,520
just commenting

1287
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,110
on,
the Irish elk was actually

1288
01:32:04,030 --> 01:32:04,863
developed its excess antlers.
The theory goes as a consequence of 

1289
01:32:07,481 --> 01:32:08,314
female sexual selection course,
female human beings are very choosy 

1290
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:14,050
maters.
Unlike chimpanzees,

1291
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:14,943
let's say,
and there is reasonable evidence that 

1292
01:32:17,201 --> 01:32:18,034
one of the factories that propelled our 
political evolution forward was female 

1293
01:32:20,951 --> 01:32:21,784
sexual choosing this and and that's what
perhaps that it's eve tempts Adam into 

1294
01:32:26,861 --> 01:32:27,694
self consciousness in genesis,
and maybe that's why there's been new 

1295
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:33,310
eternal enmity between men and women 
ever since,

1296
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:36,250
because women certainly do make men self
conscious.

1297
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:39,340
It might be the primary effect that 
women have.

1298
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:43,510
Men that's advantageous in a more 
conscious men are better,

1299
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:46,280
but it's disadvantages for the manner in
itself.

1300
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:49,030
Consciousness is generally a very 
unpleasant emotion,

1301
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:50,583
so I would say however,
that self consciousness is the gateway 

1302
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:53,703
to transcendence and development,
and so the best thing for human beings 

1303
01:32:57,491 --> 01:32:58,324
to do is to bear up underneath their 
self-conscious tragic end to transcend 

1304
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:05,710
passed that by becoming even more 
conscious.

1305
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:08,070
And I think that's the hope that we 
have.

1306
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:08,913
I think that that's what the great 
religions of the world constantly 

1307
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:15,880
dangled before us is that if you are 
suffering in your half a weak state,

1308
01:33:15,881 --> 01:33:19,780
then it's time to wake up completely and
then perhaps that will go away.

1309
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:21,380
Well,
we don't know,

1310
01:33:21,381 --> 01:33:26,381
but we don't have a better option.
No other option is annihilation and that

1311
01:33:28,181 --> 01:33:31,750
seems a bit premature,
shall we say.

1312
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:37,890
Yeah.
Given that we're not all we could be,

1313
01:33:37,891 --> 01:33:39,450
it seems a bit premature.

1314
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:44,753
Some of your youtube videos you have 
talked about the ancient mythology of 

1315
01:33:49,230 --> 01:33:54,230
Babylon in Egypt and you described it as
a way that they act out what they sensed

1316
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:57,963
to be true,
but even because they couldn't 

1317
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:00,093
articulate,
is there a modern day equivalent of 

1318
01:34:04,150 --> 01:34:09,150
acting out the truth and if so,
describe it for us?

1319
01:34:14,850 --> 01:34:18,840
Well,
I would say in large part Christianity's

1320
01:34:18,990 --> 01:34:19,570
exactly.

1321
01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:21,280
No,
it it.

1322
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:24,280
It's fundamentally

1323
01:34:25,850 --> 01:34:30,850
description of pattern,
but in an optimized being be and the way

1324
01:34:33,611 --> 01:34:34,444
that it was generated,
and again this is a psychological 

1325
01:34:36,530 --> 01:34:39,070
interpretation.
I don't claim that it's exhausting.

1326
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:44,210
Not The least is that you could imagine 
that as people move through time,

1327
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:46,993
this is akin to the idea that the figure
of Christ is implicit in the Old 

1328
01:34:49,641 --> 01:34:53,330
Testament,
which is also a psychological idea.

1329
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:56,000
Imagine that as people progress through 
time,

1330
01:34:56,001 --> 01:34:57,110
they observed that some

1331
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:00,290
were handling exist,
it's better than others,

1332
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:01,753
and those people attracted attention and
admiration and stories regenerated and 

1333
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:09,153
so you might say that out of 100 people,
the most capable of honorable and 

1334
01:35:14,391 --> 01:35:19,391
respectable and useful and benevolent 
person was identified and then celebrate

1335
01:35:19,721 --> 01:35:20,554
it at least with admiration and then 
perhaps with stories and so then you 

1336
01:35:24,291 --> 01:35:25,124
might imagine that there were 10 groups 
of 100 people in each of them had their 

1337
01:35:28,791 --> 01:35:29,624
story of the most admirable person and 
then those stories came together as 

1338
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:33,763
those tribes amalgamated and then the 
story of the 10 most admirable people 

1339
01:35:38,241 --> 01:35:43,241
was amalgamated into.
I figured that was the most admirable of

1340
01:35:44,031 --> 01:35:49,031
those 10 and the entire groups group of 
ten one hundred tribes.

1341
01:35:49,191 --> 01:35:50,024
People could come together under that 
banner and it really looks like in some 

1342
01:35:52,551 --> 01:35:55,910
sense that's how monotheism or 
polytheism is.

1343
01:35:55,911 --> 01:35:58,520
That the tribal groups had their local 
ideals,

1344
01:35:58,521 --> 01:35:59,354
let's say,
and then when they came together and it 

1345
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:01,413
was a local ideals were amalgamated into
what you might describe as a mat at 

1346
01:36:03,891 --> 01:36:07,310
ideal and people were able to unite 
under that Metta ideal.

1347
01:36:07,311 --> 01:36:08,144
So for example,
in in Mesopotamia there was a god known 

1348
01:36:13,161 --> 01:36:16,880
as martyr and Martin had a very large 
number of names,

1349
01:36:16,940 --> 01:36:21,940
some of which are quite fascinating and
the reason he had a very large number of

1350
01:36:23,271 --> 01:36:24,104
names was because he wasn't available.
Have a very large number of previous 

1351
01:36:26,601 --> 01:36:27,434
thoughts.

1352
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:34,980
So you know,
there's an idea,

1353
01:36:36,670 --> 01:36:38,060
a Christian idea,
for example,

1354
01:36:38,061 --> 01:36:40,330
that Christ we cave case,
let's say,

1355
01:36:40,331 --> 01:36:41,164
or a hero of heroes.
And from a psychological perspective I 

1356
01:36:44,511 --> 01:36:45,344
just read that was straightforward 
observation is that pass the stories of 

1357
01:36:51,650 --> 01:36:53,990
the great people of the past,
amalgamated.

1358
01:36:54,410 --> 01:36:56,780
Out of that emerged in the human 
imagination.

1359
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:58,633
A conceptualization of the ideal.
It's a very strange conceptualization 

1360
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:02,683
because if it falls something like the 
voluntary voluntary acceptance of 

1361
01:37:07,041 --> 01:37:07,874
suffering and it's simultaneous
transcendence at that's a candidate in 

1362
01:37:13,791 --> 01:37:14,624
some sense,
the old stories of the hero who fights 

1363
01:37:17,001 --> 01:37:22,001
the dragon because of course in some 
sense the ultimate dragon is about death

1364
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:23,503
and also at the level that might produce
an unjust death and to be able to face 

1365
01:37:27,801 --> 01:37:28,634
that without shrinking is perhaps the 
essential hallmark of the most well 

1366
01:37:36,381 --> 01:37:41,381
developed character out that ideal is a 
product of the collective imagination of

1367
01:37:42,891 --> 01:37:45,770
humanity.
From a psychological perspective,

1368
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:49,490
what it means to be on that,
if anything,

1369
01:37:49,540 --> 01:37:54,540
I no position to determine.
Okay,

1370
01:38:24,050 --> 01:38:24,940
great.
Okay,

1371
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:25,863
so the question is how do you speak 
truth in a highly hierarchical 

1372
01:38:28,701 --> 01:38:29,534
environment like a workplace where 
perhaps you have disagreeable than even 

1373
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:35,780
tyrannical managers and a resistance to 
the truth?

1374
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:37,430
Well,
that's an excellent question.

1375
01:38:38,150 --> 01:38:38,983
The first thing I would say is you 
prepare yourself and so if you want to 

1376
01:38:44,241 --> 01:38:45,800
negotiate,
for example,

1377
01:38:46,130 --> 01:38:50,060
you can negotiate from a position of 
weakness because you lose,

1378
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:53,330
you'll lose in every way.
You can't stand the conflict.

1379
01:38:53,331 --> 01:38:56,870
You've got nothing to fall out.
So if you're in a workplace that's,

1380
01:38:57,470 --> 01:39:02,470
that's not admittable to
informative messages,

1381
01:39:03,171 --> 01:39:08,171
let's say the first thing you do is look
for another job or I don't,

1382
01:39:09,650 --> 01:39:11,480
I don't.
Mainly you take another job.

1383
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:16,730
That is what I need.
I mean you need to provide yourself with

1384
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:20,740
credible options because otherwise 
you'll be weak when you,

1385
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:21,933
when you stand forth and especially 
somebody who's a bully will just pull 

1386
01:39:26,091 --> 01:39:26,924
you right over because we've got no 
power and so you have to prepare 

1387
01:39:31,911 --> 01:39:36,911
yourself and you do that by reducing the
risk to yourself in an intelligent map.

1388
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,900
And one of the things I counseled my 
clients,

1389
01:39:41,990 --> 01:39:46,990
many of whom are executives or people 
who are successful,

1390
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:48,593
is that you should always be prepared to
make allowable awkward movement move 

1391
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:56,790
because otherwise you have negotiating 
power.

1392
01:39:57,410 --> 01:39:59,710
And so of course that means that if you 
have the options,

1393
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:00,583
you're in a weak position,
but it is the case that if you have the 

1394
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:07,400
options that you're weak position.
So you keep your CV update,

1395
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:12,130
you develop the skills necessary to make
you movable in the marketplace.

1396
01:40:12,410 --> 01:40:15,740
You reduce your fear of interviews as an
alternative.

1397
01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:16,643
Know that the processes that you have to
go to through to seek alternative 

1398
01:40:19,101 --> 01:40:19,934
employment,
which is a very good thing to do 

1399
01:40:20,661 --> 01:40:21,494
anyways,
and then if you could put yourself in a 

1400
01:40:24,321 --> 01:40:25,154
position of relative strength,
then you can decide what it is that you 

1401
01:40:28,911 --> 01:40:29,744
have to say first.
You don't fight unnecessary bouts and 

1402
01:40:33,771 --> 01:40:34,604
you don't make unnecessary enemies and 
perhaps you put forth attendant of 

1403
01:40:39,260 --> 01:40:44,260
suggested with brain argumentation 
behind it after perhaps also finding out

1404
01:40:44,901 --> 01:40:45,734
if there are other people who feel the 
same way you do and I'm formulating 

1405
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:52,310
intentional solution and then generally 
speaking,

1406
01:40:52,311 --> 01:40:53,144
under those conditions,
the probability that you will be 

1407
01:40:56,411 --> 01:40:57,690
successful will be buried.

1408
01:40:58,690 --> 01:41:01,420
I would also say that if under those 
conditions

1409
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:03,813
you still can succeed,
that you should leave because you're 

1410
01:41:07,781 --> 01:41:11,670
purchasing security of a person out 
there,

1411
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:13,010
pricing,
security,

1412
01:41:13,110 --> 01:41:15,400
soul,
and that's a bad choice.

1413
01:41:15,410 --> 01:41:18,490
It beat you down across time and you 
don't want that.

1414
01:41:18,890 --> 01:41:20,600
So Yep.

1415
01:41:39,590 --> 01:41:40,423
Chicken,
chicken,

1416
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:44,310
you again,
really young Americans for liberty.

1417
01:41:44,490 --> 01:41:47,920
So I'm thinking you guys and thank you.
Obviously I'm,

1418
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:49,913
I'm also here for Portland.
I completely agree with your assessment 

1419
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:53,033
with some colleagues from the newsroom,
miserable newsgroup called torch cast 

1420
01:41:55,770 --> 01:41:59,120
your mind if you've got split testing.
Um,

1421
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:04,760
I do have a societal question for you.
What in your view is the macro agenda or

1422
01:42:05,761 --> 01:42:06,990
the goal,
the end goal,

1423
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:12,020
the end game for the current sjw left 
who fight free speech,

1424
01:42:12,270 --> 01:42:13,103
obfuscate the basic concepts of identity
and you pedal outright falsity in 

1425
01:42:18,121 --> 01:42:20,880
regards to the with things,
for instance,

1426
01:42:21,870 --> 01:42:26,870
in the media and on college campuses and
is a solution,

1427
01:42:27,390 --> 01:42:28,223
not the solution,
but a solution to that moving of the 

1428
01:42:32,251 --> 01:42:34,350
overton window,
so to speak,

1429
01:42:34,410 --> 01:42:36,270
through mischief,
trolling

1430
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:40,953
speakers.

1431
01:42:42,860 --> 01:42:46,650
Well,
the motivational issue is,

1432
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:50,940
is complex.
I think some of it is

1433
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:58,550
the naive good harkness of youth.
Fair bit is that

1434
01:43:00,510 --> 01:43:01,343
some of it I think is the consequences 
of the introduction of women aren't 

1435
01:43:06,061 --> 01:43:06,894
passive to the political environment and
the manifestation of the personality 

1436
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:14,130
trait,
the personality trait,

1437
01:43:14,131 --> 01:43:18,750
agreeableness as a political force for 
perhaps the first time in history.

1438
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:20,693
It's a radical transformation and have 
women occupy positions of power and we 

1439
01:43:24,001 --> 01:43:26,460
don't know what that will be for better 
or for worse.

1440
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:29,490
To think that it will only be for better
is naive.

1441
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:34,320
You want believe so and then there's 
willful blindness.

1442
01:43:34,321 --> 01:43:39,321
There's ideological possession and
there's.

1443
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:41,213
There's a kind of.

1444
01:43:43,290 --> 01:43:44,123
I'm grateful there's a deep gratitude as
well because in a sense of historical 

1445
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:56,630
lack of historical perspective,
it's quite compelling to me to my way of

1446
01:43:56,631 --> 01:43:57,464
thinking perhaps because I'm reasonably 
well versed in the nature of historical 

1447
01:44:01,191 --> 01:44:02,024
catastrophes.
The fact that we can all assemble 

1448
01:44:05,130 --> 01:44:05,963
peacefully in this unbelievably 
beautiful place in this crazily 

1449
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:12,410
beautiful town with with the tension 
that does exist.

1450
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:13,273
Just rather minimal white historical 
standards and engage in this sort of 

1451
01:44:16,370 --> 01:44:17,203
discussion peacefully and productively 
is almost incomprehensible given the 

1452
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:29,591
evidence that's come forth to us.
Throw a kiss and I don't believe that we

1453
01:44:31,101 --> 01:44:31,934
do enough to teach our young people just
exactly how improbable that is and so I 

1454
01:44:39,621 --> 01:44:40,454
don't think they know and so what they 
see instead of the improbable 

1455
01:44:46,970 --> 01:44:47,803
functionality of our culture is all the 
errors that it still makes and it's 

1456
01:44:51,711 --> 01:44:56,711
reasonable for them to see that,
but not without that broader context.

1457
01:44:58,250 --> 01:45:01,370
What to do about.
Well,

1458
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:07,010
I think the fundamental thing to do 
about it,

1459
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:08,780
as I said,
is for,

1460
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:09,853
and this is I believe the western way 
fundamentally is for people to Excel to 

1461
01:45:16,491 --> 01:45:19,970
magnify the degree to which they're 
taking personal responsibility for their

1462
01:45:19,971 --> 01:45:24,971
life because I think that as individuals
they'll find the proper way to fight the

1463
01:45:25,431 --> 01:45:30,431
micro battles that will be necessary in 
order to stamp the type of rising

1464
01:45:34,610 --> 01:45:39,610
radical
radicalism.

1465
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:41,383
Let's leave it at that.
What I think will have with the amount 

1466
01:45:44,490 --> 01:45:47,600
of what I would also encourage people to
do is to

1467
01:45:49,850 --> 01:45:54,050
stop enrolling in those classes.
I mean the humanities are bleeding.

1468
01:45:54,051 --> 01:45:57,500
People like map men are leaving in 
droves.

1469
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:00,230
There won't be a man in the humanities 
at 10 years.

1470
01:46:00,510 --> 01:46:02,720
And then most of the social sciences as 
well.

1471
01:46:02,721 --> 01:46:03,554
I mean I've watched the enrollment 
curves for really for decades and have 

1472
01:46:07,311 --> 01:46:08,144
seen this propagate itself across time,
but more delicately even is that the 

1473
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:13,333
overall proportion of enrollment amongst
students in the humanities has declined 

1474
01:46:17,810 --> 01:46:18,643
every decade since the 19 sixties.
And so as the humanities moves farther 

1475
01:46:22,821 --> 01:46:25,280
away from what it is that they truly 
have to offer,

1476
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:26,143
which is the transmission of the wisdom 
of the past to youth so that they could 

1477
01:46:31,311 --> 01:46:32,144
see their proper way forward and to 
become articulate well are responsible 

1478
01:46:37,041 --> 01:46:40,430
citizens.
As they abandoned that responsibility,

1479
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:45,150
then all they have to offer is dynamism 
and resentment.

1480
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:46,093
That doesn't sell well except to a tiny 
fraction of people who would like to 

1481
01:46:49,411 --> 01:46:51,570
have as much of that as they can 
possibly manage.

1482
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:56,010
We see it.
We see it happening.

1483
01:46:57,350 --> 01:47:00,770
That essay,
overall cultural shift tour.

1484
01:47:00,970 --> 01:47:05,970
I'm selling also to people in the 
liberty rally in Berkeley.

1485
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:12,020
You look at essentially every post 
college protest on the streets,

1486
01:47:14,210 --> 01:47:17,940
Portland to Chicago.
It seems that how,

1487
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:18,913
how do we address the.
This type of narrative is not just 

1488
01:47:22,761 --> 01:47:23,594
adding all this,
but it seems that the idea of what you 

1489
01:47:26,490 --> 01:47:30,290
were given your framework of getting 
into the Kingdom of God,

1490
01:47:30,590 --> 01:47:33,150
the kingdom is completely different for 
the

1491
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:36,260
cultural issues.

1492
01:47:37,210 --> 01:47:38,043
Yeah.
Well,

1493
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:39,460
well,
you know,

1494
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:44,880
in many times in my life I trucked face,
let's say the choice between a political

1495
01:47:46,751 --> 01:47:47,584
group and this say philosophical root or
a psychological root that I had chosen 

1496
01:47:51,521 --> 01:47:56,320
to go and what I gave you tonight is 
really the best answer that I have.

1497
01:47:56,650 --> 01:47:59,230
I'm not trying to make the case that 
would that.

1498
01:47:59,260 --> 01:48:00,093
That's a comprehensive answer,
but I think that if you want to move 

1499
01:48:04,961 --> 01:48:05,794
forward properly,
the best thing to do is to organize 

1500
01:48:08,291 --> 01:48:09,124
yourself.
I need personally to organize yourself 

1501
01:48:11,381 --> 01:48:12,214
as well as you possibly cap at the gift,
those things around you that aren't in 

1502
01:48:15,491 --> 01:48:16,324
order in order your family,
how you conduct yourself because then 

1503
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:20,733
you're going to be in the best position 
to make the proper decisions in the 

1504
01:48:23,721 --> 01:48:24,554
specific situations that uptake to you 
and I think that that's where people 

1505
01:48:28,691 --> 01:48:32,740
have their power and I think that power 
is not insignificant.

1506
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:36,550
Not at all.
So that's the best I can do for that.

1507
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:41,970
Yeah,
I mean I can.

1508
01:48:42,060 --> 01:48:42,893
That was a really interesting question 
and I'm not a social justice warrior 

1509
01:48:46,201 --> 01:48:49,200
myself,
but as I understand it,

1510
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:53,490
I think a lot of people I've talked to 
who we think about that,

1511
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:54,493
I think they're really trying to 
dismantle what they see to be unfair 

1512
01:48:57,121 --> 01:49:01,230
systems have advantages and the 
patriarchal structures they have it.

1513
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:03,150
So,
um,

1514
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:07,950
my question is because this,
this truth idea really,

1515
01:49:07,951 --> 01:49:09,060
really interests me.
Uh,

1516
01:49:09,070 --> 01:49:09,903
do you feel that because of the limits 
of your own human experience and your 

1517
01:49:12,541 --> 01:49:13,374
own identity,
that there are things that you will 

1518
01:49:14,581 --> 01:49:16,310
never be able to change your mind?

1519
01:49:22,030 --> 01:49:26,130
I think there are that,
there are things that I'll never.

1520
01:49:26,190 --> 01:49:30,250
There are things are,
let's say would stake my life on,

1521
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:32,340
which I think is a better way of putting
it.

1522
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:37,470
I'm one of those is that it's better to 
serve,

1523
01:49:38,150 --> 01:49:43,150
to denounce it at that it's better to,
to not lie,

1524
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:48,550
let's say instead of telling the truth,
because someone asked earlier,

1525
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:52,720
how can you go about telling the truth 
and in some sense you can,

1526
01:49:52,721 --> 01:49:55,690
but you can't stop seeing things you've 
known to be false.

1527
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:56,763
Which is a good start.
And that's within anyone's scrapped and 

1528
01:49:59,530 --> 01:50:00,363
I could say I'm not likely to change my 
mind about the utility of doing that 

1529
01:50:04,690 --> 01:50:05,523
either because I've decided that I'm 
going to accept the consequences of 

1530
01:50:09,971 --> 01:50:14,260
doing that gratefully regardless of what
the consequences are.

1531
01:50:14,590 --> 01:50:15,423
And so at some point in your life,
and perhaps not precisely when you're 

1532
01:50:19,511 --> 01:50:20,344
young,
you have to decide what it is that 

1533
01:50:22,361 --> 01:50:25,780
you're going to act out something Carl 
you specify,

1534
01:50:25,810 --> 01:50:26,643
he said,
know you're going to act out of 

1535
01:50:28,271 --> 01:50:30,640
mythological structure of one type or 
another.

1536
01:50:31,210 --> 01:50:33,610
You're either going to be aware of it or
not.

1537
01:50:33,820 --> 01:50:36,400
If you become aware of it,
that perhaps you could choose it.

1538
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:40,740
And that doesn't give you any guarantee 
precise,

1539
01:50:40,830 --> 01:50:42,700
you know,
because even if you act out,

1540
01:50:42,701 --> 01:50:43,534
let's say that her path,
you know when you and you face the 

1541
01:50:46,181 --> 01:50:48,730
dragon and combat,
there's no necessary.

1542
01:50:49,450 --> 01:50:53,000
It's not a necessity that you when the 
dragon to the EU.

1543
01:50:53,530 --> 01:50:57,670
But the idea is that that's your best.
Fap All things considered.

1544
01:50:57,671 --> 01:51:00,970
It's your best bet to face it 
forthrightly.

1545
01:51:00,971 --> 01:51:01,804
And I believe that.
I believe that because I'm a clinical 

1546
01:51:03,641 --> 01:51:04,474
psychologist and one of the,
one of the things that clinical 

1547
01:51:07,361 --> 01:51:08,194
psychologists know is that if you help 
people confront the things that they 

1548
01:51:12,191 --> 01:51:13,024
avoid voluntarily,
they get better and that that's a 

1549
01:51:17,950 --> 01:51:18,783
fundamental truth and I think it's the 
fundamental truth of human advancement 

1550
01:51:21,821 --> 01:51:22,654
and learning and it's possible that we 
are Irish elk and our fundamental 

1551
01:51:27,641 --> 01:51:28,474
approach to the world is deeply flawed 
and if we pursue it wholeheartedly will 

1552
01:51:31,481 --> 01:51:32,610
end up estate.

1553
01:51:32,890 --> 01:51:33,723
It is possible that that's the case,
but if that's the case that there's 

1554
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:37,610
nothing I can do about it,
time,

1555
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:38,973
part of the human race and I'm going to 
act out its destiny the best that I can 

1556
01:51:41,621 --> 01:51:46,621
manage and and I'm not willing to 
reconsider things at that level.

1557
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:48,513
I think that that's because I've thought
them through sufficiently for me and 

1558
01:51:52,241 --> 01:51:54,880
because I've also determined the course 
of my own life,

1559
01:51:54,881 --> 01:51:55,714
that and from watching the effects of 
what I be talking about or other people 

1560
01:51:59,951 --> 01:52:00,784
that what I'm doing is serving the good 
at least as well as I could do it and 

1561
01:52:06,940 --> 01:52:09,940
what I've learned is be very helpful to 
me personally.

1562
01:52:09,941 --> 01:52:13,870
It's been very helpful to my family.
I know it's been helpful for my students

1563
01:52:13,871 --> 01:52:14,704
because they always tell me that and 
people write me all the time and say 

1564
01:52:18,550 --> 01:52:19,383
that they'd found a great utility in 
what I was communicating and so that's 

1565
01:52:27,311 --> 01:52:32,311
enough evidence for me right now that
I'm on a path that's sufficient,

1566
01:52:34,430 --> 01:52:38,860
that sufficiently justifies me.
So

1567
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:41,973
I'd just like to say we have about 20 
minutes until probably going to take 

1568
01:52:45,830 --> 01:52:46,040
five

1569
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:46,873
or 10 minutes more questions then about 
10 minutes to fill about talks about 

1570
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:53,450
themselves and make their way out.
So typically

1571
01:52:56,470 --> 01:53:00,800
I just like to thank everybody who 
helped organize this event.

1572
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:01,873
Um,
I've been watching yourself on youtube 

1573
01:53:04,461 --> 01:53:09,461
for a while now and I really felt that 
you help me and I'm sure

1574
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:13,370
really,
I really appreciate.

1575
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:15,913
Hey,
it's a pleasure.

1576
01:53:17,330 --> 01:53:22,330
So I'm just wondering,
based on history and whatnot that you go

1577
01:53:24,291 --> 01:53:29,291
into a discussed like the archipelago 
and whatnot,

1578
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:35,590
what kind of role do you think 
government should play in society?

1579
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:49,640
I think that it depends on the 
circumstances

1580
01:53:51,230 --> 01:53:54,500
and so I don't think that that's the 
right question.

1581
01:53:55,700 --> 01:53:56,533
I think the right question is how should
the government constituted itself so 

1582
01:54:01,731 --> 01:54:05,300
that it can respond flexibly to the 
demands of the situation.

1583
01:54:06,650 --> 01:54:07,483
I believe that there's utility in a 
conservative viewpoint and I believe 

1584
01:54:11,421 --> 01:54:13,730
that there's utility in a liberal 
viewpoint,

1585
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:14,793
but that it determined it depends on the
specifics of the situation and that 

1586
01:54:18,711 --> 01:54:22,940
there is also error and even 
catastrophic error on both sides,

1587
01:54:23,870 --> 01:54:26,030
so the government needs to be 
constituted.

1588
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:31,040
I would say much like it is what else 
were sovereignty is,

1589
01:54:31,580 --> 01:54:32,413
is instantiated it people for better or 
worse so that the people can learn from 

1590
01:54:35,991 --> 01:54:36,824
their errors and that we progress by 
engaging in dialogue across people of 

1591
01:54:43,461 --> 01:54:44,294
different temperamental types because 
sometimes the borders are to open and 

1592
01:54:50,091 --> 01:54:50,924
they need to be tight and sometimes the 
borders are too closed and they need to 

1593
01:54:55,221 --> 01:54:56,960
be elusive if they be.

1594
01:54:57,020 --> 01:55:00,350
If the borders between everything become
completely closed and everything,

1595
01:55:00,351 --> 01:55:02,780
God's right,
it's deprived of air,

1596
01:55:02,790 --> 01:55:03,623
water and everything died.
So there's endless mythological 

1597
01:55:06,620 --> 01:55:09,050
representations of that would be part of
the reason that Egypt,

1598
01:55:09,051 --> 01:55:10,640
for example,
in the mosaic story,

1599
01:55:10,641 --> 01:55:11,474
is a kingdom of Sam.
That stone is because Sam Stone Water 

1600
01:55:15,590 --> 01:55:17,270
and Moses who's,
who's,

1601
01:55:17,430 --> 01:55:18,263
who's someone who leads his people out 
of tyranny is a master of water and the 

1602
01:55:21,621 --> 01:55:22,454
message and that story is that sometimes
the kingdom turns to stone and it's a 

1603
01:55:25,581 --> 01:55:30,290
tyranny and new revivification needs to 
be integrated.

1604
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:33,380
The doors have to open,
a new information has to flow in,

1605
01:55:33,950 --> 01:55:36,800
but then there are times when I.
The story,

1606
01:55:36,801 --> 01:55:40,490
for example,
there are times when,

1607
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:44,310
uh,
there's too much influx of inflammation.

1608
01:55:44,330 --> 01:55:45,163
That's a flood.
That's one way of reading the flood 

1609
01:55:46,950 --> 01:55:49,760
stories.
There's just too much pouring in.

1610
01:55:49,770 --> 01:55:53,610
Everyone drops.
And what we have to always ask ourselves

1611
01:55:53,670 --> 01:55:56,310
is,
are we tending the garden properly?

1612
01:55:56,730 --> 01:55:59,370
Right?
It's not drying out for lack of water.

1613
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:01,650
It's not drowning because there's too 
much,

1614
01:56:01,680 --> 01:56:02,513
there's too much moisture coming in,
and the only way we can determine that 

1615
01:56:05,610 --> 01:56:06,443
is by paying attention to communicate.
And that's why free speech is such a 

1616
01:56:08,971 --> 01:56:11,820
fundamental necessity.
So it's not,

1617
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:15,840
it's not precisely what the government 
can do because it has to do many things,

1618
01:56:15,870 --> 01:56:20,220
but because it's the society of people 
and people have to do many things,

1619
01:56:20,610 --> 01:56:21,443
but how the government goes about making
decisions and then at least with the 

1620
01:56:25,801 --> 01:56:29,130
government that has to do is protect 
those,

1621
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:30,593
what would you call the rare and 
precious processes that enable it to 

1622
01:56:33,931 --> 01:56:36,760
continue to be a responsive and alive 
entity.

1623
01:56:37,190 --> 01:56:39,820
And I think that we have done a 
remarkably good job of that.

1624
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:44,400
The West and I think that the US is a 
great example of that for all its flaws.

1625
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:46,140
Everything is flaw,

1626
01:56:47,010 --> 01:56:47,843
but,

1627
01:56:49,220 --> 01:56:52,280
but the proper analysis is flawed 
compared to white.

1628
01:56:52,340 --> 01:56:56,150
And the answer is to the hypothetical 
utopia of your imagination.

1629
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:57,193
The answer is to other similar systems 
that have actually existed in time and 

1630
01:57:00,321 --> 01:57:03,320
space.
And by that measure I would say the West

1631
01:57:03,321 --> 01:57:08,321
is doing spectacularly well and I don't 
think that we should sync it because of.

1632
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:11,690
Because we're ignorant to vote.
It's available.

1633
01:57:17,530 --> 01:57:22,530
Thank you.
Postmodern philosophers,

1634
01:57:25,301 --> 01:57:27,490
they mentioned this happened.
That's

1635
01:57:29,210 --> 01:57:33,580
destructive ideas caused people 
questioning.

1636
01:57:33,730 --> 01:57:38,730
We cited
a who has mentioned as an inspiration,

1637
01:57:41,170 --> 01:57:42,670
so,
uh,

1638
01:57:42,671 --> 01:57:47,450
I wonder how might somebody like or 
somebody like me

1639
01:57:49,910 --> 01:57:50,743
getting each other?

1640
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:53,990
Well,
a

1641
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:57,180
reasonable amount of food,
colon,

1642
01:57:58,240 --> 01:58:02,260
I would say that among the 
postmodernists he's rather remarkable in

1643
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:04,990
the fact that you can actually 
understand what you say,

1644
01:58:07,070 --> 01:58:07,903
what he wrote particularly surprising,
like the idea that mental illness is in 

1645
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:12,993
part a social construct is if you're a 
reasonably educated clinician that's 

1646
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:19,713
more than self evident in virtually 
every complex activity that human 

1647
01:58:24,410 --> 01:58:28,180
engagement is culturally determined to a
large degree,

1648
01:58:28,850 --> 01:58:31,390
a exterra doubt that I have a problem 
with.

1649
01:58:32,090 --> 01:58:32,923
Uh,
and I also know that he put his finger 

1650
01:58:35,561 --> 01:58:36,394
on a very complex problem,
which is like the central postmodernist 

1651
01:58:39,820 --> 01:58:44,410
place.
Every situation allows for a potentially

1652
01:58:44,411 --> 01:58:47,620
infinite number of interpretations which
is true,

1653
01:58:48,130 --> 01:58:52,300
and therefore it's difficult to 
determine which interpretation should be

1654
01:58:52,301 --> 01:58:56,230
held up as paramount.
Now that's true.

1655
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:57,273
In fact,
the artificial intelligence researchers 

1656
01:58:58,631 --> 01:58:59,464
ran into that.
They were trying to design systems that 

1657
01:59:01,001 --> 01:59:01,834
could perceive the world because the 
original idea was that perceiving the 

1658
01:59:04,691 --> 01:59:05,524
world was easy because it's just made a 
phase and learning how to manipulate 

1659
01:59:09,790 --> 01:59:10,330
those states.

1660
01:59:10,330 --> 01:59:13,000
That act would be the complicated 
problem,

1661
01:59:13,150 --> 01:59:13,983
but it actually turned out perception 
was the complicated problem because 

1662
01:59:16,481 --> 01:59:19,030
there's an indefinite number of ways to 
perceive things.

1663
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:20,733
Now,
the reason the postmodernist role were 

1664
01:59:23,741 --> 01:59:24,574
wrong is because there aren't an 
indefinite number of interpretations of 

1665
01:59:28,331 --> 01:59:32,570
the world that don't kill you or make 
others killed you.

1666
01:59:32,950 --> 01:59:33,783
There's a very constrained number of 
interpretations that allow you to 

1667
01:59:35,921 --> 01:59:39,130
continue to exist and equally 
importantly,

1668
01:59:39,131 --> 01:59:42,220
allow you to continue to exist in the 
presence of other people.

1669
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:43,353
So although there are many 
interpretations that you can ferret out 

1670
01:59:46,901 --> 01:59:47,734
of the Shakespeare text,
your job is to ferret out what that 

1671
01:59:50,201 --> 01:59:51,034
actually helps you live.
And that's hypothetically the goal of 

1672
01:59:54,491 --> 01:59:55,324
the guides to great literature.
And so I think the postmodernists 

1673
01:59:58,211 --> 02:00:02,200
radically overplayed their hand and 
that's particularly true with data.

1674
02:00:02,590 --> 02:00:03,423
And I think that the people who followed
Aryzta are in many cases doing so 

1675
02:00:07,121 --> 02:00:07,954
because it's a hell of a lot easier than
actually doing the difficult job of 

1676
02:00:10,660 --> 02:00:15,660
extracting out useful tools from the 
literature of the world,

1677
02:00:15,730 --> 02:00:16,563
which is what you do when you read,
you extract out useful tools with 

1678
02:00:19,541 --> 02:00:23,530
regards to nature being each has said 
something about everything.

1679
02:00:24,220 --> 02:00:27,220
And so every philosopher of the modern 
age,

1680
02:00:27,490 --> 02:00:28,323
one way or another is deeply influenced 
by nature and the problem with niches 

1681
02:00:32,110 --> 02:00:36,190
that he was a thinker prolific beyond 
comprehension.

1682
02:00:36,220 --> 02:00:39,520
Virtually I did recently.
I did a,

1683
02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:44,200
I think it was a 45 minute video on one 
paragraph.

1684
02:00:44,280 --> 02:00:46,210
You choose beyond good and evil and you 
know,

1685
02:00:46,211 --> 02:00:47,044
I barely started to scrape the surface 
of it and of course he has multiple 

1686
02:00:50,051 --> 02:00:54,160
books.
So Nisha is a very strange character.

1687
02:00:54,161 --> 02:00:58,210
And he said that he philosophize with a 
hammer and he meant it.

1688
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:02,680
And his critique of Christianity was 
devastating I would say.

1689
02:01:03,430 --> 02:01:04,263
But I would also say,
and this is a rather shocking 

1690
02:01:06,431 --> 02:01:09,280
comparison,
that nature play.

1691
02:01:09,670 --> 02:01:10,503
The role that you played with regard to 
Christianity was the same rule that a 

1692
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:15,873
complaining that wooed,
which is the can devour athlete but 

1693
02:01:18,371 --> 02:01:19,580
disease,
flesh and leave,

1694
02:01:19,581 --> 02:01:20,414
what's healthy behind,
and I think there is a reading if 

1695
02:01:21,971 --> 02:01:22,804
Nietzsche that allows each of that 
allows for precisely that when he said 

1696
02:01:26,561 --> 02:01:27,394
that God was dead,
he also said that that would be a 

1697
02:01:30,461 --> 02:01:31,210
catastrophe.

1698
02:01:31,210 --> 02:01:32,043
The likes of which we could not even 
imagine that society itself would 

1699
02:01:34,630 --> 02:01:38,350
oscillate back and forth murderously for
centuries as a consequence.

1700
02:01:38,590 --> 02:01:39,423
So it wasn't triumphant.
He strolled to find out what an 

1701
02:01:43,101 --> 02:01:43,934
alternative to that point.
Yet he formulated the idea of the 

1702
02:01:46,461 --> 02:01:48,200
overlap,
so essentially right.

1703
02:01:48,201 --> 02:01:51,030
The Superman was capable of creating his
own.

1704
02:01:52,070 --> 02:01:52,903
I think that each state there,
I think it was a mistake that was 

1705
02:01:55,911 --> 02:01:57,440
rectified,
Carl Young,

1706
02:01:57,710 --> 02:02:01,520
because you'll know that I think was 
really the first person.

1707
02:02:01,580 --> 02:02:02,413
Although Nicha has has intimations of 
this because nature does say that art 

1708
02:02:06,311 --> 02:02:08,090
drives philosophize,
right?

1709
02:02:08,091 --> 02:02:11,550
Which is very biologically oriented 
observation.

1710
02:02:11,910 --> 02:02:14,150
Like what you noted was that,
well,

1711
02:02:14,170 --> 02:02:18,290
we don't create our own values because 
the values are implicit within us,

1712
02:02:18,350 --> 02:02:19,183
but we can read the start and that's why
he was so interested in the analysis of 

1713
02:02:22,490 --> 02:02:23,323
mythology and the unconscious and so I 
think the postmodernists took the the 

1714
02:02:29,690 --> 02:02:30,523
part of nature that's only destructive 
to its final conclusion and that's 

1715
02:02:34,140 --> 02:02:35,690
what's being played out now.

1716
02:02:36,660 --> 02:02:37,493
Derrida's critique of modern 
civilization is failing a logocentric 

1717
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:42,320
right?
Male dominated,

1718
02:02:42,350 --> 02:02:43,183
centered around the idea of the logos.
He regarded that as nothing but a tool 

1719
02:02:46,071 --> 02:02:46,904
of oppression and marginalization.
There's some truth in that because 

1720
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:51,433
whenever you produce a value system,
you also exclude things from the value 

1721
02:02:55,431 --> 02:02:56,264
system as valuable obviously,
but the problem I think that the 

1722
02:03:00,441 --> 02:03:01,274
postmodernist smoke address you the 
alternative pretty all your systems and 

1723
02:03:07,251 --> 02:03:08,084
dealing with the with the exclusive that
comes along with that is to drop it 

1724
02:03:11,590 --> 02:03:16,590
nihilistic chaos and worse while you're 
drawing to get nihilistic chaos,

1725
02:03:16,890 --> 02:03:21,710
you're going to call out sources of 
totalitarian order and so it's no,

1726
02:03:23,030 --> 02:03:23,863
it's no sweat.
What I seek postmodernism doing do 

1727
02:03:26,050 --> 02:03:27,360
students,
generally speaking,

1728
02:03:27,361 --> 02:03:31,070
it's demoralizing completely until they 
come to university.

1729
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:32,053
Looking to categorize the identity,
often cleaning to the last rebated 

1730
02:03:35,871 --> 02:03:39,320
shreds of their culture.
That's just what's keeping them afloat.

1731
02:03:39,570 --> 02:03:42,590
All the postmodernist professors do is 
take those remaining.

1732
02:03:42,591 --> 02:03:45,380
Frank's took her along to stay above the
water,

1733
02:03:45,560 --> 02:03:48,590
tell their illusory and take them away.
It's like,

1734
02:03:48,591 --> 02:03:50,120
well,
now you're free.

1735
02:03:50,550 --> 02:03:52,340
Like I've dropped you in the middle of 
the ocean.

1736
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:55,040
You could swim in any direction you 
want.

1737
02:03:55,550 --> 02:03:56,383
You're free.
And I think that that's rooted in large 

1738
02:03:59,331 --> 02:04:01,250
part.
Even in hatred of youth.

1739
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:06,020
I really believed that because why would
you crippled people if you didn't pay?

1740
02:04:06,790 --> 02:04:09,310
And so there's hatred of humanity 
lurking at the bar,

1741
02:04:09,311 --> 02:04:11,930
but the worst excesses of video logs in 
general.

1742
02:04:11,990 --> 02:04:13,600
You know,
you hear this from environmentalist,

1743
02:04:13,601 --> 02:04:16,370
so I've heard this many times,
the planet,

1744
02:04:16,371 --> 02:04:18,430
it would be better off if there were no 
people on it.

1745
02:04:18,850 --> 02:04:19,220
It's like,
well,

1746
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:21,730
let's keep you away from the thermal 
nuclear weapons.

1747
02:04:27,540 --> 02:04:30,250
Thanks.

1748
02:04:31,020 --> 02:04:34,890
So it's not easy to come up with a 
canonical interpretation of nature.

1749
02:04:34,891 --> 02:04:37,140
There's no doubt about that.
Again,

1750
02:04:37,230 --> 02:04:38,063
would say,
I thought for a long time from a 

1751
02:04:41,281 --> 02:04:42,114
psychological perspective,
I tried to understand whether the 

1752
02:04:44,980 --> 02:04:47,310
speeches philosophy that drove him 
insane,

1753
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:50,250
but I think the evidence for that is 
nonexistent.

1754
02:04:50,280 --> 02:04:51,113
I think he did suffer from a 
degenerative brain disease severity and 

1755
02:04:54,150 --> 02:04:56,460
I actually think different fundamental 
laws,

1756
02:04:56,490 --> 02:04:59,760
which I haven't read everything he wrote
because there's books,

1757
02:04:59,761 --> 02:05:00,594
pumps,
but I read this great works in 

1758
02:05:01,561 --> 02:05:03,930
chronological order,
I think is fundamental.

1759
02:05:03,950 --> 02:05:04,783
Philosophy is is affirmative negative,
but he's a critic and he wanted to find 

1760
02:05:11,971 --> 02:05:14,390
something that he could stand on and 
that's what critics,

1761
02:05:14,720 --> 02:05:16,830
real critics here.
You're not looking to destroy you.

1762
02:05:16,831 --> 02:05:17,664
I'm looking for something that you could
stand up and nature was certainly very 

1763
02:05:19,831 --> 02:05:20,664
useful to me in.
I knew it was also extraordinary useful 

1764
02:05:22,831 --> 02:05:27,210
to crawl your was a real student of 
nature and I was really devoting himself

1765
02:05:27,211 --> 02:05:29,670
to solving the problem that each 
proposed,

1766
02:05:29,820 --> 02:05:30,653
which is well,
what do we do with the aftermath of the 

1767
02:05:31,861 --> 02:05:32,694
depth of God and humans?
Answer was we rescued from the deaths 

1768
02:05:36,340 --> 02:05:37,173
and that's the right dance.
That's what the university should be 

1769
02:05:39,211 --> 02:05:40,890
doing with young people.
It's like you're dead.

1770
02:05:40,930 --> 02:05:43,610
Father's in the library,
go out there and fought.

1771
02:05:43,690 --> 02:05:44,680
Fair to help.
Right.

1772
02:05:44,690 --> 02:05:45,523
And Unite.
Live and become the thing that keeps 

1773
02:05:48,061 --> 02:05:49,450
chaos at bay.
Right.

1774
02:05:52,210 --> 02:05:57,210
Thank you.

1775
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:05,440
Concludes our talk with Jordan Peterson.
Please join me in thanking.

1776
02:06:05,441 --> 02:06:06,274
You've been getting.

1777
02:06:06,460 --> 02:06:11,460
Thank you.
