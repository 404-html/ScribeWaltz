1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:06,420
So the grades will be posted on
blackboard as soon as they're ready and

2
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:08,880
all open up the blackboard.
So you can see.

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:15,390
All right,
so onto the next round of clinicians.

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,710
We're going to focus mostly today on
Carl Rogers.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,960
I'm going to start with some background.
Carl Rogers was a phenomenologist and so

6
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,800
it's useful to know what that means
because you hear people use words all

7
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:40,200
the time like,
well maybe not all the time,

8
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,670
probably not the grocery store usually
like phenomenology or existentialism,

9
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,480
postmodernism and structuralism and all
those things.

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,850
It's not.
It's frequently the case that

11
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,250
it isn't that easy to figure out what
they're talking about and sometimes

12
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:58,190
that's because they don't know,
you know,

13
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:02,700
because it's actually quite difficult to
make a reasonable conceptual distinction

14
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:05,100
between all those different modes of
thinking.

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,120
And phenomenology came out of philosophy
and its earliest advocate was a guy

16
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:18,150
named Edmund has several and it's most
famous proponent was probably heidegger

17
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,870
and a high degree.

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,880
Gotten lots of trouble because he ended
up supporting the Nazis at least to some

19
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:29,190
degree.
So that's pretty good reason to get in

20
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:30,480
trouble.
All things considered,

21
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,990
you know,
although,

22
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:36,050
you know,
most people did that for 30 some years

23
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,480
in Germany,
so not that that's any excuse.

24
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:44,481
Obviously
it's hard to exactly get your head

25
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,140
around what the phenomenologists are
talking about.

26
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:51,390
I was reading about David chalmers this
morning.

27
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:53,490
I don't know how many of you know about
David Chalmers,

28
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:58,491
but he's a philosopher who started the
Tucson conventions on consciousness and

29
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,110
chalmers.
I'm not sure what I think about

30
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:08,890
gentleman.
He's very charismatic and he's got away

31
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,170
with words and setting up those
convention center has done a great deal

32
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:16,670
for the study of consciousness.
But um,

33
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,660
sometimes I think that what he pointed
out to scientists was obvious.

34
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,110
It's funny,
you know,

35
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,620
when they're,
when psychology was primarily behaviors,

36
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,050
which was back in the fifties,
it came as a big shock to psychologists

37
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,890
when certain psychologist started to
talk about cognition.

38
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,780
They called that the cognitive
revolution.

39
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,420
And you know,
I think it was obvious to everybody but

40
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:41,610
psychologists at that point that people
thought.

41
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,910
And I think it was perhaps the same
situation with philosophers if it's

42
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,970
pretty obvious to everybody that
consciousness was a tough nut to crack,

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
but the philosophers kind of ignored it
and chalmers brought it back into the

44
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,350
academic.
Mainstream.

45
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,750
Phenomenologists are really all about
consciousness.

46
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,470
They just accepted as a fact
rather than trying to deny its existence

47
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:10,450
because it can't be easily reduced to
its material.

48
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:14,320
Substrate.
Chalmers big point was that he couldn't

49
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:19,150
understand why evolution couldn't have
produced creatures exactly like us who

50
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,360
have no conscious awareness that you
call them.

51
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:27,361
Zombies fundamentally said that the
existence of consciousness as an

52
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:29,320
enduring mystery.

53
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,410
Well,
I think that's true.

54
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:36,130
I don't not sure that we've got anywhere
in terms of figuring out exactly what

55
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:38,290
consciousness is,
despite a lot of time and effort put

56
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:42,370
into it and despite a lot of tremendous
amount of work done on the brain.

57
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,410
But anyways,
the phenomenologists are.

58
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:47,890
They just took it as a fact.
Now,

59
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,340
heidegger believe that western
philosophy had lost its way really since

60
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:59,551
the time of the Greeks and he thought
that phenomenal or that is primary field

61
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:05,401
of focus should be being itself,
not reality,

62
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,910
but being,
and it's not easy to understand what he

63
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:11,020
meant by it being,
but

64
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,110
the phenomenal field,
the idea of a phenomenal field somewhat

65
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:21,111
captures it so
for height of your reality was what you

66
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,310
experienced.
So he sort of you sort of tip the

67
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:28,090
tables.
Instead of presuming an objective world

68
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,710
and then deriving the subjective from
it.

69
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:34,711
He presumed that
the entirety of your experiences were

70
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:40,231
real
and that included your emotions and your

71
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:46,111
felt motivational states and your dreams
and your fantasies and even your

72
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:51,460
delusions.
Now,

73
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:56,461
that doesn't mean that people like
heidegger thought that all the elements

74
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:59,320
of lived reality belonged in the same
category.

75
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,950
So if you thought that
dreams and the reality that you've

76
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:07,720
shared with other people were
indistinguishable from one another,

77
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,280
you'd be just as pathological to a
phenomenologist as to anyone else.

78
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,370
But they were trying to get back to the
central mystery of life.

79
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:25,290
Which is that
there is something rather than nothing,

80
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:30,291
I suppose the that we experienced it
and that's the place where Roger Starts.

81
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,160
One of the presumptions of,
of the Rogerian is,

82
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:46,161
is that in order to help someone,
you have to put yourself in their shoes

83
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,490
fundamentally,
so you have to try to see the world from

84
00:05:49,491 --> 00:05:54,290
their perspective
and that means adopting

85
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,270
the viewpoint.
It means adopting the reality that

86
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:04,271
manifests itself to them
so that you can develop an empathic

87
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,690
understanding,
body focused understanding of the person

88
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:09,570
that you're talking to.

89
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,100
So let's talk about Rogers for a minute.
He was a devout fundamentalist

90
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:25,130
Protestant and I think that's important
to know because a lot of his thinking

91
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:31,550
has a very strong Protestant flavor.
I mean the reason I concentrate on such

92
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:35,790
things and the philosophical background
at these things because you have to

93
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:39,180
understand the axioms of the thinker
that you're dealing with or you actually

94
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:43,440
don't understand them at all.
And when you're assessing the axiomatic

95
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:47,070
presuppositions of the paper,
you're usually outside the thinkers

96
00:06:47,071 --> 00:06:48,510
thought in some sense,
right?

97
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:52,500
Because you're looking at axioms,
but you don't get it unless you.

98
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,850
Unless you know the axiom,
and so Carl Rogers thought was deeply

99
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:59,540
grounded in his protestantism,
but his,

100
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,390
his father in particular was a
scientific farmer and applied the

101
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:05,670
scientific method on the farm that he
grew up in,

102
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,060
and so rogers had a devout
fundamentalist background of the sort

103
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,110
that was more typical in the thirties
and the forties,

104
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:21,410
but he also had a powerful
understanding of the scientific method

105
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,460
and practical observations of its
utility.

106
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,520
So
He.

107
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,310
His first academic training was that the
Union theological seminary seminary in

108
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:39,480
the mission of of that seminary was to
evangelize the world in their

109
00:07:39,481 --> 00:07:42,920
generation.
If I remember correctly,

110
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:47,520
it was when he was on a boat to China to
serve as a missionary that he first

111
00:07:47,521 --> 00:07:50,550
started to question the absolute reality
of his,

112
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,490
of his Protestant beliefs.

113
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,900
It isn't that he abandoned them,
particularly.

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,950
Instead,
he incorporated them into a approach to

115
00:08:01,951 --> 00:08:06,951
psychotherapy that fulfilled all the
preconditions for this.

116
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,870
There's this,
there's this striving towards a kind of

117
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:16,140
interpersonal perfection that goes along
with protestantism.

118
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,940
There's an idea that the most important
realization of the most fundamental

119
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:29,091
reality is to be had in direct and
honest communication between two people

120
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,090
and
two or more people.

121
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:41,010
That's a place where you might say,
if you're thinking about it

122
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:45,840
symbolically,
that the living word emerges and Roger's

123
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:48,690
thinking is deeply,
deeply rooted in in that kind of

124
00:08:48,691 --> 00:08:53,010
conception,
and it's partly that he believed that if

125
00:08:53,011 --> 00:08:57,540
you could integrate yourself properly,
if you could put yourself together in

126
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:02,541
some sense at every level of analysis,
then you'd be able to exist and

127
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:06,660
communicate in a way that was.
There's a eddie and flavor to this that

128
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:10,260
was optimally beneficial to you,
but also optimally beneficial to other

129
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:14,880
people at the same time and a lot of
that would emerge in your interactions

130
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:19,881
with each other in communication.
So here's something to think about.

131
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,450
This is a way of approaching what Rogers
was up to.

132
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,650
Imagine how you use words.

133
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,380
Now,
you could use words instrumentally,

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,090
but start with that.
If you imagined that you want something

135
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:41,450
from someone and then you might think,
well,

136
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,900
how can I phrase my argument so that I'm
going to get back from this person and

137
00:09:47,271 --> 00:09:48,350
then you might think,
well,

138
00:09:48,351 --> 00:09:51,790
what sort of argument would appeal to
that person and what buttons can I push

139
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:56,791
and how can I get what I want,
and then you're using words in an

140
00:09:56,811 --> 00:09:59,930
instrumental way.
You're using them as tools to obtain

141
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,320
what you desire from other people.
Now,

142
00:10:03,321 --> 00:10:06,800
I think if you do that completely,
you're a psychopath.

143
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:12,910
I mean that because a psychopath has no
room for you at all.

144
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,780
It's about him or her and you're there
to be used as an instrumental target.

145
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,030
Now,
I'm not saying that every time someone

146
00:10:23,031 --> 00:10:26,600
uses language instrumentally,
they're acting like a psychopath,

147
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,880
but
that's the logical conclusion to that

148
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,110
form of language use.

149
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,920
Now,
then you might think,

150
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,863
well,

151
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,330
you can manage a little kids trying to
do that to their parents,

152
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,730
right?
Siblings will often collude.

153
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,590
We'll have a little conspiratorial
conversation about how to approach one

154
00:10:49,591 --> 00:10:52,530
parent or the other.
Usually by isolating the parents.

155
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:57,531
That's a good strategy and then they'll
phrase their requests so that they can

156
00:10:57,661 --> 00:11:00,770
extract out the desired benefit.
Um,

157
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,740
I follow these pickup artists online.
I'm very interested in their use of

158
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:10,980
psychology and they are instrumental
light would users,

159
00:11:10,981 --> 00:11:13,440
right?
So their trick is they're developing a

160
00:11:13,441 --> 00:11:18,441
whole little hope or of verbal tricks
that they use in attempts to seduce.

161
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,380
It's a very narrow focus and it's
instrumental language.

162
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,580
It says if the,
the personhood of the,

163
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,540
of the target is irrelevant
fundamentally.

164
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,260
So it's a fairly pathological.
It can become pathological,

165
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:39,270
very easy.
So then you might say,

166
00:11:39,271 --> 00:11:41,610
well,
how would you use language if you

167
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:42,840
weren't using instrumental?

168
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,790
Because you know,
you have to have a career and you have

169
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,460
to be goal oriented,
you have to be aimed towards things.

170
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:49,770
And so since you have to be goal
oriented,

171
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,730
how can it be other than that,
you would use language instrumentally.

172
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,810
One of the Rogerian position would be
would be that

173
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,400
you should try to become aware of the
totality of your subjective experience

174
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,370
so that not only do you feel it in an
embodied sense,

175
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,910
but that you represented at a that you
represented and the representation would

176
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:23,440
be mostly in terms of articulation.
It isn't clear that Roger is considered

177
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:25,270
other forms of representation,
but

178
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,180
for Rogers,
the movement towards health is an

179
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:34,900
integrative process and it gets very
body focused,

180
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,780
but the outcome of that integrative
process which Rogers would say is the

181
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:45,781
ability to live the good life is that
your language is no longer instrumental.

182
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,790
What you're doing instead is attempting
to state the truth as you see it because

183
00:12:54,011 --> 00:12:57,850
of course your truth as a partial truth.
Obviously the basket you can do is,

184
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,710
well,
I really think the best you can do is

185
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:03,190
not lie because you can't tell the truth
because you're too damn stupid,

186
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:04,810
right?
You don't know enough to tell the truth,

187
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:08,950
but you can certainly do your best to
represent what you know is clearly as

188
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:12,130
you possibly can in your communication
with other people.

189
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,640
And so rogers believed that it was the
moral responsibility of the therapist to

190
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:23,560
do that personally and then that to the
degree that that was being done in the

191
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:27,970
therapy and the therapy
relationship and the therapeutic

192
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:31,750
relationship,
that that in and of itself would be

193
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:36,190
healing.
And so basically Roger's theory is that

194
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,060
honest communication heels.
No,

195
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:43,060
you know,
that's quite an interesting theory.

196
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,890
No,
it's not.

197
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,830
It's not completely unaligned from
Freud's earlier claims,

198
00:13:49,831 --> 00:13:50,880
right?
Because Freud

199
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,510
basically presumed that it was.

200
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,660
I didn't put so much of a moral element
on it.

201
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:07,930
He reviewed the person more as as being
trapped between titanic opposing forces,

202
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,190
the IED underneath and the superego on
top important illegals are crunched up

203
00:14:13,191 --> 00:14:18,050
in the middle and as a consequence of
being pulled and product and crushed by

204
00:14:18,051 --> 00:14:23,051
those titanic forces,
pathology was likely to emerge and he

205
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:26,620
talked about repression.
But for attendant,

206
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:31,630
if you repression as an unconscious
process for for Rogers,

207
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,700
the moral element of the therapeutic
process is much clearer,

208
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:40,880
I believe.
And most of the time when you listened

209
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:43,970
to Rogers or you read what he had to
say,

210
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,380
the injunctions that he's laying out or
moral injunction now,

211
00:14:48,381 --> 00:14:52,700
it's quite interesting because you don't
necessarily of psychotherapy as a moral

212
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:57,330
endeavor and I really never thought
about it that way fully until I read.

213
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,740
I was reading were on trust at the same
time,

214
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,080
but you don't talk,
wait out.

215
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:05,570
The proposition in this book that most
of the problems,

216
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,960
many of the problems that people came to
see a therapist about,

217
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,110
we're actually moral problem since they
were moral problems of various sorts.

218
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:19,160
Now sometimes the person was in trouble
because they had done something

219
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:20,780
seriously,
seriously wrong.

220
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,140
You had one client,

221
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,830
if I remember correctly,

222
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,960
and he discovered,
if I remember correctly,

223
00:15:31,961 --> 00:15:36,910
that she had killed her children and she
did that when they were young.

224
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,390
She had them.
She let them become exposed to

225
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,250
tuberculosis.
I think it was.

226
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,780
She didn't take the proper precautions.
And the reason she did that was because

227
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:50,560
she wanted to marry someone and he
wasn't very interested in her children.

228
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:56,080
So you might consider that a moral
problem apparently.

229
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,740
Apparently it was weighing on her
conscience,

230
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,350
you know,
as might well now it's a strange thing

231
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,210
because in some sense what she did was
turn a blind eye to something she could

232
00:16:07,211 --> 00:16:11,080
have prevented it in legal terms that's
known as willful blindness,

233
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,190
but she knew whatever that means.
Well,

234
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,470
there's lots of different levels of
knowing,

235
00:16:17,471 --> 00:16:19,390
right?
You can know something in your body,

236
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,550
you can know something in your
imagination.

237
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,040
You can know something in articulated
form,

238
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,130
you know,
so the whole issue of knowing it's a

239
00:16:27,131 --> 00:16:32,131
very complicated,
but rogers

240
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,280
definitely believed as far as I can
tell,

241
00:16:38,281 --> 00:16:43,281
that
there was a moral dimension to life that

242
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:47,550
it was identifiable.
That in some sense it was linear,

243
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:51,690
that it had an observable process which
was the continual integration of

244
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,370
experienced within the phenomenal field,
the ironing out of contradictions within

245
00:16:56,371 --> 00:16:58,350
the phenomenal field.
So you might think,

246
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,550
well,
what happens when you,

247
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,430
when you feel one way and you say
something else,

248
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,803
I mean,
you're all in,

249
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,900
you're all perfectly
familiar with that experience.

250
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:12,870
In fact,
my experience with people has been that,

251
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,410
and this is another issue with
instrumental use of language.

252
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:16,951
You know,
you say,

253
00:17:16,951 --> 00:17:18,570
well,
what are you using your language for?

254
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,030
Well,
have to get what you want,

255
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,270
but that can be consciously manipulated,
but then maybe we'll say,

256
00:17:24,271 --> 00:17:27,210
well that's what the psychopath is like,
except the psychopath is not only

257
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:30,480
consciously manipulative.
He's also unconsciously manipulative

258
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,000
because he's been practicing it for like
three decades,

259
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,840
so all the little machines in his head
header deceptive to and they run on

260
00:17:36,841 --> 00:17:41,280
automatic so he'll just lie just to see
if he can pull one over on you because

261
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:43,950
that demonstrates that not only is he
smarter than you,

262
00:17:43,951 --> 00:17:46,470
but that you deserve to be victimized
because you're such an idiot.

263
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,070
So.
But people use instrument language like

264
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,900
that.
Not only consciously to get what they

265
00:17:52,901 --> 00:17:54,040
want,
but you know,

266
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,610
it's something that we definitely think
of is characteristic for example,

267
00:17:57,611 --> 00:17:59,440
of teenagers.
Right.

268
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:03,310
I mean there isn't a teen movie that's
been made in the last 50 years.

269
00:18:03,311 --> 00:18:07,270
I don't claim that it doesn't deal with
the negative consequences of using

270
00:18:07,271 --> 00:18:08,620
instrumental language.
Right.

271
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:13,670
Basically the team has put in some
position where they're being polled hold

272
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,900
by maybe various social forces,
different friendship groups or,

273
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,943
or there's a

274
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,090
um,
but there was a

275
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,600
contractor

276
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,440
interrelationship between what their
friends and their parents want or what

277
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:29,950
their friends wanting their school wants
or what they want and their friends want

278
00:18:29,951 --> 00:18:33,250
or what the school wants.
So all of these things are pulling and

279
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:36,730
pushing in different directions and the
directions are essentially in some,

280
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,360
in some sense the directions or moral
because they're all about what to do.

281
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,260
And the plot of the movie is how the
teenager,

282
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,800
it's usually a Rogerian plot.
It's usually about how the teenager

283
00:18:47,801 --> 00:18:51,580
comes to more to fuller self
realization,

284
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,650
right?
And that they're able to,

285
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,910
that they're able to stave off the,
the temptations that are posed sometimes

286
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:04,120
by the authorities so they don't become
too obedient and sometimes by their

287
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:08,530
peers so that they don't become only a
reflection of peer pressure

288
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:13,740
question.
Absolutely peer pressure is up here if

289
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,050
your pressure is absolutely fab.

290
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,790
And so if you're using language to fit
in,

291
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,140
well that's also instrumental use of
language and for and for Rogers,

292
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:30,360
that would be one of the sources of
pathology.

293
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,400
Now
it's very much worth taking this

294
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:36,234
seriously.

295
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,143
So

296
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,160
here's an example that I thought about a
lot.

297
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:45,270
What do you do if you're at work and
someone tells you to do something that

298
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:48,060
you don't want to do.
And I don't mean that.

299
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,520
Forget,
assume you're disciplined,

300
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,010
you know,
assuming that you're not just lazy and

301
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:54,690
worthless and that's why you don't want
to do it.

302
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:56,700
And you want to ask yourself that first,
right?

303
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,840
Because maybe you're just being lazy and
worthless and you should pull yourself

304
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:02,940
together and do the thing you know.
So,

305
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:05,730
but failing that,
let's say that you're being asked to do

306
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:10,560
something that you're finding,
you're having a very difficult time to

307
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:13,770
get motivated to do so that'd be one
clue.

308
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,270
And that it's also making you uneasy.
So you're waking up in the middle of the

309
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,360
night and you're being anxious and it's
running through your mind.

310
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:21,194
And

311
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,380
what should you do?
Well,

312
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,770
it's your job.

313
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:34,210
Someone who's in the hierarchy above you
is telling you to do it.

314
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,320
Maybe you should just do it.
Well.

315
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:39,220
Then you might ask yourself,
well,

316
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,430
why can't you just go ahead and do it?
You know,

317
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:42,091
you might say,
well,

318
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:44,400
maybe it's quasi criminal and you're
afraid of getting caught,

319
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:45,720
but let's forget about that for a
minute.

320
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:50,530
Let's assume that the profitability,
maybe it's a low level moral

321
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:53,530
transgression,
it's not precisely illegal and even so

322
00:20:53,531 --> 00:20:55,780
the probability that you're going to get
caught is very low.

323
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,180
Why would it bother you and should you
take that seriously?

324
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,320
Now Rogers would claim that the reason
it would bother you is because it would

325
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:13,740
make the structure of yourself system
inconsistent.

326
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,580
So
imagine you're trying to organize a

327
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:21,770
group of people to do some tasks.
You know,

328
00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:25,660
like maybe they're in a row and you have
to fill in a hole in the road and so you

329
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:29,320
have to put people in a row and if you
hadn't drugs down the line,

330
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,120
you know,
if you got one person in there who's

331
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:35,470
trying to put rocks,
the rocks go the other way or dropping

332
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:38,710
them or something like that,
well then obviously the entire structure

333
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:41,710
is not going to function properly and
it's because there's an internal

334
00:21:41,711 --> 00:21:43,690
inconsistency in 10,
you know,

335
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:46,530
it's a fundamental presupposition of,
of,

336
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,500
of logic.

337
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,330
It's maybe the most fundamental
principle of communication that a thing

338
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:55,540
can't be itself and something else at
the same time.

339
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,490
That's the principle of
noncontradiction.

340
00:21:57,491 --> 00:22:01,150
Right?
And so the hypothesis here would be that

341
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:05,380
you have to follow the principle of
noncontradiction with regards to the

342
00:22:05,381 --> 00:22:09,670
organization of your own self and the
self would be,

343
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,230
Roger's thinks about that as an art,
a differentiated field,

344
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,480
subfield of the phenomenal field.
Right?

345
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:21,481
So you're always experiencing things and
part of what you experience is the EU at

346
00:22:21,851 --> 00:22:24,760
the center of that.
And that's the self as far as Roger's is

347
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:28,990
concerned.
And the proposition would be you have to

348
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:34,050
organize the self in a non contradictory
manner or well,

349
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,630
or what well,
or you feel negative emotion.

350
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,510
Now he would think about that as anxiety
general.

351
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:45,540
Yes.
The narrative around the test make it

352
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,493
work.

353
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,970
Well that might work.
You know,

354
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:56,890
I mean that's a very good and
complicated question because what you're

355
00:22:56,891 --> 00:22:57,611
asking is,
well,

356
00:22:57,611 --> 00:23:00,750
why wouldn't,
why can't be rationalized effectively.

357
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,280
That's really.
Well

358
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:11,650
the.
That's a postmodern theory I would say

359
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:15,100
in some sense because the postmodern
like to claim that there's nothing

360
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:17,140
outside of the text,
right?

361
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:20,980
And then things in some sense are
infinitely malleable and that the

362
00:23:20,981 --> 00:23:24,670
malleability comes as a consequence of
the different narratives that you might

363
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,870
might weave.
But Rogers would point out that,

364
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,820
well,
the first thing that you pointed out is

365
00:23:30,821 --> 00:23:32,860
that stupid,
which it is.

366
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,540
I mean there's all sorts of things that
are characteristics of your

367
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,630
characteristic,
of your experience that have a non pecs,

368
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,770
like phenomenology,
you know,

369
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:45,770
like I think it's very,
very difficult to claim that pain is,

370
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,950
is textual.
No.

371
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,160
And we do know that you can,
you can manipulate the way an organism

372
00:23:54,051 --> 00:23:55,760
feels pain quite extensively.

373
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,570
So for example,
if you whack the dog on the nose with a

374
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,400
newspaper,
every time it goes to eat,

375
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,340
it will starve to death.
You can teach it not to eat very

376
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:06,770
rapidly.
And so what you're doing is you're

377
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:10,630
teaching the dog that hunger is
punishing and then it transforms Hungary

378
00:24:10,631 --> 00:24:14,420
into anxiety and then it won't heat.
So the reason I'm telling you that is

379
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:16,910
because even something as fundamental as
hunger,

380
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,430
which you might think about as I'm a
basic phenomena,

381
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,090
can be modulated by learning.
But there are limits to that.

382
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,680
They're evident limits to that.
Now,

383
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:29,681
I think the problem with reading a
narrative is that even if it's complex

384
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:32,960
and sophisticated and so you've
convinced yourself,

385
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:37,760
that doesn't necessarily mean that the
actions and perceptions undertaken as a

386
00:24:37,761 --> 00:24:41,540
consequence of that formulation are
going to be commensurate with the rest

387
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:42,590
of your personality.

388
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,240
It's a big risk,
you know,

389
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,600
so and I think it is the risk that
people run when they tell themselves or

390
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,930
act out a deep falsa now because for
Rogers,

391
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,120
you could also act out false hoods,
right?

392
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,620
In fact,
the philosophers call that a

393
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,500
performative contradiction.
That's when you say one thing and do

394
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:02,090
another.
It's a form of lie,

395
00:25:02,091 --> 00:25:04,280
but it's an embodied line.
Rogers was,

396
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:08,240
he was a very.
He was very cognizant of embodiment as

397
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:10,010
a,
as a central human feature,

398
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,240
so you know,
he was very concerned about the fact

399
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:18,500
that the representational structures had
to take into account the realities of

400
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:21,620
the underlying biology and those.
So those would be felt states in a

401
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:24,720
sense.
So I think the Rogerian answers,

402
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,700
you can't get away with it that easily.
What that'll do is it'll produce

403
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:33,730
contradictions as you move forward and
those contradictions will will unsettle

404
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:37,850
you either in a minor way or in a deep
way.

405
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,410
Now,
as far as I can tell by Rogers,

406
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:46,420
never really formalized a theory about
why something is deep and why something

407
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,320
was shallow in terms of it's
misrepresentation,

408
00:25:51,321 --> 00:25:56,321
but we've already talked about that.
If you think about the hierarchical

409
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:58,430
structure that I've showed you,
many times,

410
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,870
the idea there is that higher level of
the abstraction that you mess around

411
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:06,040
with the more of your personality you
pathologize said,

412
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:09,890
I've been thinking this week too,
that that hierarchy,

413
00:26:09,891 --> 00:26:11,600
you know the one I showed you many
times,

414
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:14,090
I believe I have anyways,
little aids in rows.

415
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:17,180
I think that's the structure of the
unconscious actually,

416
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:21,950
so and you'll miss about without at your
peril because you're programming your

417
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:26,540
own perceptions and your actions and so
the Rogerian presupposition,

418
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,750
and this is why I'm talking about the
presuppositions that underlied his

419
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:33,980
thinking because the Rogerian approach
is based on a deep presupposition,

420
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:38,240
which is that honest integration
matters.

421
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,370
Now you could say,
well,

422
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,100
perhaps not.
It's like,

423
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,980
well,
that's the question that people have

424
00:26:43,981 --> 00:26:45,900
been debating since the beginning of
time,

425
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,400
but my experience as a therapist,
just so you know,

426
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,650
I've never seen anyone get away with
anything.

427
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,690
I think every time you do something that
you know isn't right,

428
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,150
you're going to get all up for it.
Sooner or later.

429
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:05,130
Now you made me blinded yourself so
badly because of your ms apprehensions

430
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:09,360
and deceptions that you can't see the
causal connection between what you did

431
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,770
and the punishment.
In fact,

432
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:15,771
sometimes it takes years of
psychotherapeutic investigation to,

433
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,680
to lay out the causal narrative,
but why?

434
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:24,900
Why would anybody ever think they can
bend the structure of reality and get

435
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:25,860
away with it?
You know,

436
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,890
to me it's like,
you know those plastic rulers,

437
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,350
it's like you can hold one of those in
front of your nose and bended forward

438
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:34,080
and that's fine,
but as soon as you let go,

439
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:37,110
it's going to hit you in the face and so
you know,

440
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:40,170
then you're going to curse face faith
because you've got hit in the face,

441
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,850
but you bent the down ruler.

442
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,910
Yup.
Economic incentive as far as like you

443
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:50,990
need to survive in order to have a life
and your view raped,

444
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:55,990
like having your economic needs as being
higher than dealing with this unsettled

445
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,130
have been in the scenario because that's
like being at work and fulfilling the

446
00:28:00,131 --> 00:28:04,750
needs of the task has been assigned to
you by your superior than you still

447
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,220
have.
You still get to survive so you can take

448
00:28:06,221 --> 00:28:10,240
easily to have a roof over your head,
but you just have to sort of deal with

449
00:28:10,241 --> 00:28:12,210
the consequences of this slight subtle.

450
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,550
Well,
I mean,

451
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,560
no,
I would say sometimes people are put

452
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:20,400
into positions that unsettled them and
they don't know what to do.

453
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,230
You know,
they're kind of,

454
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,110
they're screwed if they do this and
they're screwed if they do that and

455
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:28,620
that's all they can see to do and people
get put in those situations all the

456
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:30,180
time.
But,

457
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:33,000
and I,
I'm not really going to talk about those

458
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:34,770
except that people really suffer for
that.

459
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,253
Um,

460
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,960
partly what Rogers is talking about is a
form of optimal organization,

461
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,320
right?
So it's to be considered as the final

462
00:28:48,321 --> 00:28:50,930
goal in some sense.
It's what you're working towards.

463
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,210
I think it's very difficult to live in a
way that you,

464
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,440
so that you never encountered
contradictions as you move forward.

465
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,860
In fact,
that's precisely what does happen as you

466
00:29:00,861 --> 00:29:05,861
move forward and it's up to you on the
fly to Oregon to organize your response

467
00:29:06,381 --> 00:29:10,100
to those contradictions in a manner that
doesn't destabilize the entire

468
00:29:10,101 --> 00:29:11,570
structure.
But you know,

469
00:29:11,571 --> 00:29:13,880
the entire structure is a strange thing
because again,

470
00:29:13,881 --> 00:29:16,820
Rogers Rogers has gotten a
psychoanalytic.

471
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,620
Well,
it's not exactly right.

472
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,120
It's complicated

473
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:27,420
the hierarchy that Roger's describes his
characteristic of the self.

474
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,770
This is something he doesn't discuss
that much.

475
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,120
The hierarchy that you make of yourself
as not independent of the way that you

476
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:40,240
fit into hierarchies in the world.
So really by hierarchically reorganizing

477
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,570
yourself the same time you're
hierarchically organizing the world.

478
00:29:43,571 --> 00:29:47,020
And so part of the problem is,
is that if you destabilize yourself or

479
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:50,020
if you come up with a sub optimal
solution,

480
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,570
there's a,
there's a twist there that's going to,

481
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:56,560
it's going to follow you up.
Now it may be the best that you've got.

482
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,420
Sometimes that happens,
you know,

483
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,530
I'm not saying that you can always solve
a problem in an optimal manner,

484
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,810
you know?
Do you remember the movie Sophie's

485
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:07,180
choice?
Did you ever see that movie?

486
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,743
Um,

487
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,960
Sophie,
it's a movie about that,

488
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:17,560
about Germany during the Nazi period,
she had to choose which of her two

489
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:20,350
children was going to be shocked.
Well,

490
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,390
you know,
it's pretty hard to come up with an

491
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:25,800
optimal
solution to that problem.

492
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,733
Right?
So

493
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:33,570
Roger's though didn't really think that
that actual problems in life constituted

494
00:30:33,571 --> 00:30:36,690
psychopathology.
That's sort of more the existentialist.

495
00:30:36,691 --> 00:30:40,680
Although he had an existential twist.
He was thinking more that what

496
00:30:40,681 --> 00:30:44,880
constituted psychopathology per se
instead of just plain ordinary suffering

497
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,400
was the contradictions that arose
because people fail to use their

498
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:56,660
potential for articulation in a manner
that continually fostered their

499
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:58,110
integration.
So he would say,

500
00:30:58,111 --> 00:30:59,670
well,
to the degree that you were going to use

501
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,310
instrumental language,
it's not a term he used,

502
00:31:02,311 --> 00:31:06,960
but it's a good summary of,
of his philosophy that you were bringing

503
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,930
to bear on yourself unless and others
around you.

504
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,250
Unnecessary pain and suffering,
and that was psychopathological.

505
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,640
It's psychopathological because it's
unnecessary because in principle it

506
00:31:17,641 --> 00:31:18,570
could be avoided.

507
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:20,763
So.

508
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,870
So that's the idea.
And so the idea as well as the

509
00:31:27,871 --> 00:31:32,280
organizing principle that brings you
into this optimally functioning

510
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:37,281
hierarchy is your commitment to truth,
to accurately represent what it is that

511
00:31:38,101 --> 00:31:40,320
you experience.
And that's again,

512
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:44,610
you know how Piaget talked about the
fundamental truth as a process rather

513
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:49,611
than as a state or a fact it's the case
for Rogerian phenomenon phenomenology as

514
00:31:50,101 --> 00:31:51,570
well,
and you could kind of understand that

515
00:31:51,571 --> 00:31:54,150
because of course therapists are dealing
with people,

516
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,540
living people and life is a process,
not a state.

517
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,900
And so rogers was concentrating very
much on the process which he regarded as

518
00:32:03,691 --> 00:32:06,660
absolutely crucial and believe that the
process,

519
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:10,830
the process properly implemented would
bring about the best possible

520
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:14,940
organization and then we'll update that
organization as necessary to.

521
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:19,140
So it's a radical idea.
But I would also say that it's

522
00:32:19,141 --> 00:32:24,030
fundamentally rooted in his Protestant
Christianity because one of the tenants

523
00:32:24,031 --> 00:32:28,140
of Christianity is that the word orders
chaos.

524
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:33,010
And so that idea was lurking at the
bottom of Roger's conceptual structure

525
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:36,200
and you know,
he was intelligent enough to articulate

526
00:32:36,201 --> 00:32:39,410
it fully in a modern way.
But that's still where it came from.

527
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,490
Now it's an older idea of Christianity.
So

528
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,080
now Roger is also believed some other
things in there.

529
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,720
And this is where I think he gets a
little bit optimistic,

530
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,310
but,
but he's no fool.

531
00:32:55,311 --> 00:32:59,450
So Rogers is one of those optimists you
really have to contend with.

532
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,100
Now he believed,
and I think this is a classical

533
00:33:04,101 --> 00:33:07,310
Protestant belief,
is as well that what evil was was

534
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:12,400
basically the absence of good and that
people had a strong in intrinsic impulse

535
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:18,650
towards the good that you could help
them realize and the way you help them

536
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:21,380
realize.
That was by setting the preconditions

537
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:26,381
for the emergence of that good,
and he believed that the preconditions

538
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:27,554
were

539
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,450
the provision of a space for
communication.

540
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,920
We're.
There was no judgment in the sense of

541
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:47,021
rejection.
And so here's the Rogerian theory with

542
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:53,681
regards to therapeutic endeavor.
Now the first thing is,

543
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:58,010
and this seems critical and I think
Rogers was right about this,

544
00:33:58,011 --> 00:34:03,011
that a client has to want to change,
and this is.

545
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,010
This is a funny thing about therapy
because my observation has been that

546
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:12,320
it's not something you can impose on
people unless they've decided that

547
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:15,170
things could be better and that
alterations in,

548
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,290
in,
in something they're doing might make it

549
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,540
better.
It's a nonstarter.

550
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,620
And so I've had clients who were court
ordered to attend therapy and that's

551
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:27,680
just complete waste of time,
especially if they're more on the

552
00:34:27,681 --> 00:34:30,470
psychopathic end of things because
you're just,

553
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,110
if they don't want to change,
they're not going to learn.

554
00:34:33,111 --> 00:34:38,000
And this is actually another Rogerian
principle because Roger's had an

555
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:42,350
educational philosophy as well and the
educational philosophy was students will

556
00:34:42,351 --> 00:34:44,420
not learn things that are not relevant
to them.

557
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:50,650
And so one of the teachers duties was to
make the material at hand relevant

558
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:55,610
because that would
help the students remember it.

559
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,430
Why remembered if it's not relevant to.
One of the things I tried to do in my

560
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:01,490
lectures,
I try to tell people when I'm lecturing,

561
00:35:01,491 --> 00:35:04,490
why they should know this.
And the fundamental answer always,

562
00:35:04,491 --> 00:35:07,670
if you push it down far enough,
is that if you know this,

563
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,240
your life will go better.
And so will the life of people around

564
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:13,120
you.
So you should listen because then

565
00:35:13,121 --> 00:35:16,940
there's some things that are sharp and
pointy that you will run into while

566
00:35:16,941 --> 00:35:19,880
you're wandering around in the fog.
So and,

567
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,480
and that's the fundamental issue.
It's,

568
00:35:21,481 --> 00:35:26,150
it's necessary to know these things and
so if you're dealing with someone who

569
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:29,060
hasn't decided that there's something
wrong and that they have something to do

570
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:30,950
about it,
then maybe they could change and that

571
00:35:30,951 --> 00:35:32,120
would make things better.

572
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,570
You're not going anywhere,
and Rogers would also say that's

573
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:41,250
actually a precondition for a
relationship period because he didn't

574
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:45,030
really make much of a distinction
between a therapeutic relationship and a

575
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:48,320
genuine relationship because he thought
the genuine relationships with

576
00:35:48,321 --> 00:35:53,321
therapeutic and so one of the principles
that you can extract from that is that

577
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:58,521
if you're in a relationship,
one useful proposition is that,

578
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,380
well,
you're pretty perfect,

579
00:36:01,381 --> 00:36:03,870
but you're probably not quite as perfect
as you could be.

580
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,850
And so it's possible that your partner,
no matter how deeply flawed they are,

581
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,550
might now and then have something to say
to you that would,

582
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,150
if you incorporated,
would bring you to an even higher state

583
00:36:15,151 --> 00:36:16,560
of perfection.
Right?

584
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,430
And so that's,
that means you have to listen and it's

585
00:36:20,431 --> 00:36:23,340
worse than that.
And this again is a Rogerian

586
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,150
observation.
You might have to help them criticize

587
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:29,430
you because maybe they're not very good
at it.

588
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,160
You know,
and so there's something they're trying

589
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:35,570
to tell you and they're stumbling way
and it's,

590
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,990
it's an actual thing,
but they can't articulate it and so it

591
00:36:38,991 --> 00:36:41,670
would be easy for you just to,
especially if you're trying to use

592
00:36:41,671 --> 00:36:44,910
language instrumentally and to get away
with it just to,

593
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:49,770
while you could even make fun of the way
they're poorly articulating the problem,

594
00:36:49,771 --> 00:36:52,590
that's a really good one because then
you can convince them not to do such

595
00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:55,500
things in the future.
But if you take the other stance,

596
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:57,210
which is,
well,

597
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:00,420
I've got some things to learn and you've
got some things to learn and you've got

598
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:03,360
some things to teach me and I've got
some things to teach you and God only

599
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:05,580
knows when that's gonna happen,
but it might happen.

600
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:09,660
So the object of the conversation is for
each person to help the other person

601
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:10,620
make their point.

602
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,720
You know?
And that's a lot different than winning

603
00:37:12,721 --> 00:37:14,730
the argument.
And I can tell you one thing,

604
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,800
you will not win an argument with any
intimate partner ever because you're not

605
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:23,430
playing the game of the argument.
You're playing the game of iterated

606
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:27,270
arguments across time and so if you win
an argument,

607
00:37:27,271 --> 00:37:32,100
you just set up another one winning and
solving the problem or the same thing,

608
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,030
so from a Rogerian perspective,
winning would be the maintenance of your

609
00:37:36,031 --> 00:37:41,031
current self structure at the cost of
failure to integrate some disintegrated

610
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:46,590
element of the phenomenological realm.
Maybe it'd be the unhappiness of your

611
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:48,330
partner.
That might be one of them.

612
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,640
Now you can.
If you win the argument,

613
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:54,570
that's the rationalization issue.
Fundamentally you don't have to change,

614
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:59,571
but the fact is you do have to change
because the way you are is giving rise

615
00:38:00,301 --> 00:38:03,240
to this situation and that's not going
to change unless you fix it.

616
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,610
So winning an argument,
fixing something,

617
00:38:05,611 --> 00:38:08,130
those are completely different things.
You fixed the thing,

618
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:13,220
it goes away and often you know,
couples have to have conflict because

619
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,710
there's no difference between conflict
and thinking.

620
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,820
Thinking is a form of war.
It's just that you,

621
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,110
you,
you make it an interior form of war,

622
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,140
right?
You can't have a without conflict

623
00:38:25,141 --> 00:38:28,650
because life is different.
Difficult and people differ from one

624
00:38:28,651 --> 00:38:30,990
another.
So they have different value structures

625
00:38:30,991 --> 00:38:34,980
and so you can't just ignore that you
have to set up a dialogue because it's

626
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,450
not necessarily obvious who's right.
Of course,

627
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,610
Rogers believed that in the therapeutic
realm too.

628
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:44,080
So he thought if therapy as something
that emerged as a consequence of the

629
00:38:44,081 --> 00:38:47,710
adoption of certain axiomatic
presuppositions and those were

630
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:53,710
things could be better than they are and
you could make them that way and that's

631
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:54,880
also true for me.

632
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,840
And then the next presumption is,
well maybe we can figure out how to do

633
00:38:58,841 --> 00:39:03,490
that in a collaborative with
collaborative communication.

634
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:08,770
So Rogers believed that the therapist
was just as transformed during the

635
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:11,260
therapeutic process as the person.
In fact,

636
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:16,120
if that wasn't happening then whatever
was happening wasn't the kind of healing

637
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:18,550
therapy that Rogers would like to have
happen.

638
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,270
And he also said that,
I'll read you something he said later,

639
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:26,350
but he also pointed out quite strongly
that that's why people don't really like

640
00:39:26,351 --> 00:39:27,370
to listen.
You know,

641
00:39:27,371 --> 00:39:31,420
like maybe there's some flaw in your
cell structure at some fundamental

642
00:39:31,421 --> 00:39:34,420
level,
fundamentally axiomatic level,

643
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,010
you know,
maybe you're narcissistic.

644
00:39:36,011 --> 00:39:37,990
That'd be a good one.
And you know,

645
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,500
if you listen to people,
they're going to tell you you're

646
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:43,720
narcissistic.
Well you don't want to find that out

647
00:39:43,721 --> 00:39:47,920
because it's going to blow a huge hole
and you're gonna blow blow a huge hole

648
00:39:47,921 --> 00:39:50,500
in yourself.
Structure that's not very fun.

649
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,160
But
hypothetically,

650
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:57,910
that beats running into the obstacles
that you will run into if you're

651
00:39:57,911 --> 00:40:01,600
narcissistic repeatedly as you move
forward through life.

652
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,200
So you can either live with your flaws
are correct.

653
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,290
That's the.
And then the,

654
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,303
the,
the,

655
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,100
the pathway to correction is dialogue,
communication.

656
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,773
So

657
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,030
now the next part of the Rogerian
therapeutic frappe yes,

658
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:18,450
yes.

659
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:23,450
What's the difference between a genuine
criticism genuinely giving her

660
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,510
perspective or just arguing point?

661
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,460
Well,
that's a good question.

662
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,530
Let's see if we can,
let's see if we can formulate that.

663
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:36,760
So the first difference might be,
well,

664
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:38,680
what's,
what's the outcome we're looking for?

665
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:42,040
Like let's think about that.
Let's think about that in the context of

666
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:43,750
a,
of an intimate relationship,

667
00:40:43,751 --> 00:40:45,820
a familial relationship.
So you have a wife,

668
00:40:45,821 --> 00:40:47,480
let's say,
and you've got some kids this one,

669
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,720
or what are your options?
What do you want?

670
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,330
Hopefully better.

671
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,870
Okay.
So that's one thing we're so that we're

672
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,160
trying to establish the domain of the
earth.

673
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,890
We're gonna we're going to try and make
things better.

674
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,390
What would better look like?

675
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:08,030
You think
of any negative emotion?

676
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,013
Feeling.

677
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:10,871
Okay.
So.

678
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:12,140
So there's something.
Okay.

679
00:41:12,141 --> 00:41:13,840
So that's a rough area.
Presupposition.

680
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:16,460
Is that part of what you're doing when
you're making things better is to

681
00:41:16,461 --> 00:41:20,770
decrease the probability that negative
emotion will arise short term or long

682
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:21,604
term?

683
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,140
Short term.
First.

684
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,950
That's what bothered me.

685
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,290
Oh,
okay.

686
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:32,490
So that's an interesting thing because
what if you have to experience a

687
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:35,750
tremendous amount of short term pain in
order to make long term progress.

688
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:39,950
If it's different from the pain that
initially got me thinking about it,

689
00:41:39,951 --> 00:41:42,710
that seems like an improvement
potentially.

690
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,320
Okay.
Okay.

691
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,060
Okay.
Well

692
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:52,220
I'm going to address your question
completely from the admin perspective,

693
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:54,410
but that's okay because it works for
Rogers as well.

694
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:59,411
It's just easier to explain
freedom from unnecessary suffering

695
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:07,390
in the short,
medium and longterm across as many

696
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,370
people as you can imagine.
Manage.

697
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,190
So we'll start with you and your family.
Okay.

698
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:15,640
How are you going to do that?
You don't know.

699
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,860
That's what you have to talk about,

700
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:23,710
but you cannot have that conversation
until you've got that framework right.

701
00:42:23,711 --> 00:42:27,760
So and it's very,
very tricky because in the midst of the

702
00:42:27,761 --> 00:42:30,700
argument,
there's going to be tremendous

703
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:35,730
temptation to oppress and deceive and
humiliate and,

704
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:40,660
and treat with contempt and hurt and
punish and threatened all of those

705
00:42:40,661 --> 00:42:41,494
things.
Right?

706
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:45,950
And that that's partly reactivity in the
short term and then it's not,

707
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:51,020
that's not properly integrated into the
overarching hierarchical structure.

708
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:53,050
So you've got to keep bringing yourself
back to that.

709
00:42:53,051 --> 00:42:55,810
It's like why should you control your
impulses?

710
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,770
Well,
because their manifestation in the

711
00:42:59,771 --> 00:43:01,720
present,
they're spontaneous and impulsive

712
00:43:01,721 --> 00:43:04,120
manifestation in the present.
Well,

713
00:43:04,121 --> 00:43:09,121
although that may be very,
it may carry with it a feeling of

714
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:15,460
freedom and power,
maybe destroying the very structure

715
00:43:15,461 --> 00:43:19,090
that's going to provide you with peace
and stability over the medium and long

716
00:43:19,091 --> 00:43:20,920
run.
So it's again,

717
00:43:20,921 --> 00:43:25,510
it's the idea of contradiction.
Now if we're having a discussion,

718
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:26,590
okay,
so let's say,

719
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,280
well we'll do this in a very local
fashion.

720
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,183
So like

721
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,770
let's say you're having a discussion
about with your partner about who's

722
00:43:40,771 --> 00:43:42,930
going to cook dinner.
Okay.

723
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,610
So you think that's a simple discussions
like it's not a simple discussion.

724
00:43:47,611 --> 00:43:51,780
It's a horrible discussion.
It's where the war between the genders

725
00:43:51,781 --> 00:43:55,530
manifests itself.
It's one of the places and dissolve it.

726
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:58,890
Weirdly not.
You actually have to solve the war

727
00:43:58,891 --> 00:44:01,350
between the genders or.
Good luck with that.

728
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:02,880
There it is.
Right in your house.

729
00:44:02,881 --> 00:44:04,740
Right?
It's like a snake in the garden.

730
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:06,600
There's no getting rid of it.
Okay.

731
00:44:06,601 --> 00:44:08,910
So then you might think,
well what's our aim for dinner?

732
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,910
Well,
do we want to have wretched,

733
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,840
miserable rotten food served by a
resentful person to a bunch of

734
00:44:15,841 --> 00:44:19,200
ungrateful rats who complained and
sniffle.

735
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,090
It's like,
no,

736
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:23,310
let's assume we don't want.
We don't want that.

737
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:23,911
Okay,
good.

738
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,610
Well we've got no one we're not aiming
at.

739
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:27,700
So like,
alright,

740
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,510
who's your cook dinner and when and what
are the rules by which we decide that.

741
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,020
Huh?
That's a tough one because you can

742
00:44:37,021 --> 00:44:38,250
return to roles,
right?

743
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:40,260
That's what you.
That's why people have roles.

744
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,450
So they don't have to have stupid
conversations like this,

745
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:44,280
but that time is gone.
Okay.

746
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:47,610
So what do you do when there's no role?
Well,

747
00:44:47,611 --> 00:44:52,440
I could make you do it,
maybe you could either do it physically

748
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:56,040
by force or I could just intimidate you
or I could make life miserable for you

749
00:44:56,041 --> 00:45:00,270
if you don't do it or you know,
there's lots of ways of using power.

750
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:05,060
Problem with that is you're not worthy.
You're not without your own book.

751
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:08,280
What happens?
And for every step I take towards making

752
00:45:08,281 --> 00:45:10,650
you miserable,
you'll get your chance.

753
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:15,480
So probably we don't want to use force
plus that's not so good for the kids,

754
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,580
you know,
as from a role model perspective and

755
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:20,220
hypothetically would want things to be
happening to them.

756
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:25,550
So tyranny looks like it's out and I
don't want you to subjugate yourself

757
00:45:26,131 --> 00:45:28,500
because maybe like maybe you're very
agreeable.

758
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:31,980
Let's say that because that's often a
problem in communication between men and

759
00:45:31,981 --> 00:45:34,830
women.
The guys more disagreeable then the

760
00:45:34,831 --> 00:45:38,350
woman is.
And so if he like Jack Sock,

761
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:41,820
the level of conflict show back off
because she doesn't like conflict for

762
00:45:41,821 --> 00:45:45,810
all sorts of different reasons.
So that's another way of winning.

763
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:50,070
Except then the person who loses his all
resentful and you end up with,

764
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,001
you know,
horrible,

765
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:56,001
miserable food fed to warning partners
who are complaining and struggling.

766
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,850
It's not a good solution.
Right?

767
00:45:59,851 --> 00:46:04,110
So then what you're left with,
well then you've gotten negotiation.

768
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,060
Okay.
So I might say,

769
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,610
well do we agree that we need to have
dinner?

770
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:09,960
Well,
you know,

771
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,800
we might think,
okay,

772
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:14,850
well we can agree on that.
How often should we have it at home?

773
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,850
Well that's going to require a fair bit
of thought.

774
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,010
You want to go out now and then how
often?

775
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:22,080
How much is that going to cost?
What are we going to spend?

776
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,030
Wherever you going to go.
Okay,

777
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,920
who pays?
Okay.

778
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,990
So that's going to be like a whole
conversation.

779
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,950
So let's say we figured that out.
It's like five days a week we're going

780
00:46:30,951 --> 00:46:31,800
to stay home.
Okay,

781
00:46:31,801 --> 00:46:33,840
who's going to occur?
Well,

782
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:36,900
do you like cooking?
Do I like cooking?

783
00:46:36,901 --> 00:46:38,640
Got something sorted out.
So that would be,

784
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:44,300
that's like a little discussion with
your own physiology in some sense.

785
00:46:45,331 --> 00:46:47,340
You know,
what's your felt state while you're

786
00:46:47,341 --> 00:46:49,590
preparing the food?
And maybe he'll say,

787
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,640
well,
I like it all cooked if,

788
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,530
if,
if there's someone in the kitchen with

789
00:46:55,531 --> 00:46:57,800
me and uh,
you know,

790
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:00,900
someone else cleans up afterwards,
um,

791
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:03,120
then it turns out that I don't mind
cooking.

792
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:05,010
Well then you might say,
well,

793
00:47:05,011 --> 00:47:07,930
it's not minding good enough,
or do you really want to enjoy it?

794
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,630
It's like,
what's the preconditions?

795
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:14,100
Preconditions would have to be met for
you to enjoy it while you want to think

796
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:16,440
about that,
because if you can get the person either

797
00:47:16,441 --> 00:47:20,430
of you who the hell cares to enjoy it,
then it's sort of self sustaining,

798
00:47:20,431 --> 00:47:22,110
right?
You put that into place and then the

799
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:25,230
thing runs smoothly across multiple
iterations.

800
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,970
And so then you might think,
well,

801
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:31,720
what are the preconditions for us to do
that in a way that would be joyful that

802
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:32,381
say,
okay,

803
00:47:32,381 --> 00:47:34,120
well that's a high,
that's a high bar.

804
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:35,260
It's like,
well,

805
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,270
one or the other,
but should learn to cook because

806
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:43,840
otherwise we're going to be eaten like a
can of Spaghetti or some other sort of

807
00:47:43,841 --> 00:47:46,630
horror.
And that's not very high quality.

808
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:49,630
So that probably have to be solved.
And then there's the problem of how you

809
00:47:49,631 --> 00:47:51,880
react to the person when they cook,
you know,

810
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,560
like,
do you just assume that that's their

811
00:47:53,561 --> 00:47:55,900
bloody responsibility and if they don't
live up to it,

812
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:59,230
there's something wrong with them,
or do you notice what they're doing and

813
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,900
express some appreciation and gratitude
and,

814
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:05,560
and in a way that would increase the
probability that would happen again,

815
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:08,650
that'd be a better solution.
So then you have to negotiate about how

816
00:48:08,651 --> 00:48:12,730
you're going to do that exactly.
Maybe even right down to the level of

817
00:48:12,731 --> 00:48:15,410
words,
but what you're saying,

818
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,760
I see what you're trying to serve a
higher order by doing that,

819
00:48:18,761 --> 00:48:19,330
right?

820
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:22,870
You're trying to.
You're trying to satisfy basic

821
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,350
organismal needs,
the provision of food.

822
00:48:26,351 --> 00:48:29,080
But food is complicated for human beings
because we just don't.

823
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:32,440
You just don't put dog food in the bowl
and child down.

824
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:34,960
Even dogs won't do that.
Our dog won't eat less.

825
00:48:34,961 --> 00:48:39,050
We're eating no.
So human beings are extremely social

826
00:48:39,051 --> 00:48:42,760
leaders,
so you have to get that right and so.

827
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,800
But the conversation will only take
place in the proper manner if your

828
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:52,300
orientation is proper in the,
during the conversation and the

829
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:56,710
orientation needs to be,
how can we make this better for both of

830
00:48:56,711 --> 00:49:00,490
us in the long run and for the people
around you and that you have to bow down

831
00:49:00,491 --> 00:49:03,100
before that in some sense as the
highest,

832
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,280
highest order principle that you're
serving.

833
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:09,940
And then you can stumble around trying
to work that out and then you might say,

834
00:49:09,941 --> 00:49:13,610
well,
you cook three times a week and I cooked

835
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,100
twice and I'll take care of once.

836
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:17,860
And uh,
then of course you have to get the whole

837
00:49:17,861 --> 00:49:21,040
grocery thing settled out and that's a
whole other bloody complicated

838
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,960
conversation,
but it needs to be done.

839
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,340
And then you might say,
well,

840
00:49:24,341 --> 00:49:28,000
let's run this for a couple of weeks and
we'll see how it goes,

841
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:30,820
and then we can meet again and we can
discuss what worked and what didn't.

842
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,240
And the goal is to make it better,
make it better,

843
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:38,380
make it better and make it better.
And then no one's trying to win.

844
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:41,140
Well,
it depends on what you mean by when I'm

845
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:44,260
not trying to defeat you.
Why will have to live with you?

846
00:49:44,261 --> 00:49:45,940
That'd be the first reason is like,
what the hell?

847
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:46,900
Good.
Is it defeating you?

848
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,940
Unless I want someone wandering around
like this.

849
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:51,910
You don't resentful and bitter.
Maybe I do want that.

850
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:55,600
But I don't think that's a very good
place to start.

851
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,330
So when you have a client come in to see
you,

852
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:03,460
the rule is I can tell you the rules
aren't used because they're Rogerian.

853
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,330
Um,
I will tell the person what I think

854
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:11,760
so I won't tell them that what I think
is right.

855
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:16,560
But if they're doing something and I,
I have a reaction to that of some sort

856
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,550
that'll usually express itself in a
fantasy or a thought and I'll just tell

857
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:22,620
them what happened.
And you know,

858
00:50:22,621 --> 00:50:27,621
I tried to do it as gently as I possibly
can because you can use the as a club,

859
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:32,450
but then that's not the truth.
And then it needs to get the honest

860
00:50:32,451 --> 00:50:34,880
response of one person to what their
life.

861
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:37,760
And I'll tell you,
I've seen lots of people who've never

862
00:50:37,761 --> 00:50:41,340
got the honest response of any one
person ever in their whole life to what

863
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:44,690
their life and so they have no idea what
they're like or what's annoying other

864
00:50:44,691 --> 00:50:47,570
people or how they should behave or any
of those things.

865
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,500
So even though I'm not going to be right
and you know,

866
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:55,930
in that my reactions won't be precisely
accurate representation of the average

867
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:59,690
response of other people,
which is basically what you're trying to

868
00:50:59,691 --> 00:51:00,524
model.

869
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:02,780
It's going to be a lot better than
they've had so far.

870
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:06,530
And then the other precondition is
you're going to try really hard to get

871
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:08,390
yourself together,
whatever that means.

872
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:11,630
We're going to talk about whatever that
means and I'm going to support you in

873
00:51:11,631 --> 00:51:13,820
that.
And that's our goal.

874
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,980
And that that's a variant of Rogerian
unconditional positive regard.

875
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,860
And his,
his unconditional positive regard in

876
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:25,010
some sense was,
was the setup for the therapy.

877
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:29,720
So the presupposition is your valuable,
although maybe you're a little on the

878
00:51:29,721 --> 00:51:31,670
bent and twisted side,
but you know,

879
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,060
maybe you could be straightened up into
something that's like deadly.

880
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,070
And uh,
we're going to start with that

881
00:51:37,071 --> 00:51:39,890
presupposition and we're going to learn
along the way,

882
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:41,540
but that's what,
that's what we're,

883
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:46,280
that's what we're aimed at.
So the unconditional positive regard,

884
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,870
it's like a human rights thing because
the basis of the idea of human rights is

885
00:51:50,871 --> 00:51:54,020
that people are valuable,
they have some intrinsic value,

886
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,720
you know,
and the thing,

887
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:00,620
I think maybe it's pr,
it's reasonable to presuppose that from

888
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:05,000
the Rogerian perspective is that what's
valuable about you as you're being

889
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:06,320
right,
you're a conscious,

890
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:11,400
you're a locus of experience,
and as such you're a unique locus of the

891
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:11,930
experience.

892
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:15,350
And as such you have something to
contribute that no one else can

893
00:52:15,351 --> 00:52:17,780
contribute.
And that that's valuable.

894
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,410
It's intrinsically valuable.
That's the basic presupposition of the

895
00:52:21,411 --> 00:52:22,700
idea of human rights,
by the way.

896
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,150
So if that's acted out in the
therapeutic session,

897
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:29,090
but it's acted out in any relationship,
that's therapeutic.

898
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:30,890
Here's a,
here's a counter example.

899
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:34,310
Let's say you're trying to smoke,
trying to quit smoking.

900
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:36,800
You're trying to quit smoking,
okay?

901
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:38,390
And your friends smoke.
Okay?

902
00:52:38,391 --> 00:52:41,990
So what are they doing?
Like do they offer you a cigarette at

903
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:44,240
every possible opportunity because
that's very common.

904
00:52:44,241 --> 00:52:46,460
People do that very commonly.
Why?

905
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:49,370
Well,
maybe they're mad that maybe they're mad

906
00:52:49,371 --> 00:52:52,160
that they can put smoking or maybe if
you quit that they didn't,

907
00:52:52,161 --> 00:52:55,610
that would cast a bit them in a bad
shadow or maybe they're just being

908
00:52:55,611 --> 00:52:58,190
malevolent or maybe it's a game or
whatever,

909
00:52:58,191 --> 00:53:02,660
but one of the things that isn't is in
the best interest of the person who's

910
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:06,950
trying to quit smoking or drinking or
eating or you know,

911
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:11,240
or behaving in any sort of dismal manner
that's self defeating across time.

912
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,300
And so one of the things that,
you know,

913
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:21,070
I had a client just a while back and he
was talking about I'm an older sibling

914
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:25,120
and he used to make these models very
complicated models.

915
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:29,010
He was quite young at this time.
His sibling was like a decade and a half

916
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:30,600
older,
so he was like 10 or something like

917
00:53:30,601 --> 00:53:33,000
that.
Make these really complex Martin's.

918
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:36,510
He'd spend a couple of weeks building
them and then when the older sibling

919
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,220
came in,
he just smashed them up.

920
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,730
Like we'll see what kind of stress this
thing can take.

921
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:42,750
It's like,
okay,

922
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:45,540
what's going on there?
Well,

923
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:49,890
I wouldn't say it's unconditional
positive regard with the aim of

924
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,470
encouraging the person and bringing them
to fruition.

925
00:53:52,471 --> 00:53:56,160
It's quite the opposite and it's an
instrumental use of action.

926
00:53:56,161 --> 00:54:00,450
It send the point is not to elevate me
or you or both of us.

927
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,470
The point is I'm going to be the monster
at the top of the hierarchy.

928
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,510
If you're all crunched up in lying at
the bottom,

929
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,600
that's just fine.
And that's a very common set of

930
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:11,160
motivations.
And you might ask,

931
00:54:11,161 --> 00:54:14,670
well why isn't that okay?
Well that's a good question.

932
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,780
I think the right answer to that is as a
long run game,

933
00:54:18,781 --> 00:54:22,140
it's counterproductive.
No one benefits.

934
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:26,970
So there's local benefits to you for the
short in the short term.

935
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:30,210
So.
Alright,

936
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:36,930
let me read you some things that Rogers
wrote.

937
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:41,520
Okay,
this is a good one.

938
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:46,730
This is because this is his statements.
Here's some of his axiomatic

939
00:54:49,641 --> 00:54:54,080
presuppositions.
So this is what you need to cleave to.

940
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,080
If you're going to engage in the process
of Virginia in therapy,

941
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:02,750
you have to want to be independent.
Now that's an interesting.

942
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:04,760
I don't know,
maybe we can actually have a discussion

943
00:55:04,761 --> 00:55:06,080
about this.
You know,

944
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:16,870
Freud thought the eatable complex was
universal and what he meant by that.

945
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:21,560
People just don't have this discussion,
but we can give it a shot.

946
00:55:21,561 --> 00:55:25,940
We'll see how it goes.
What he meant by that was that

947
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:29,663
the,

948
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:33,330
that's struggling out of the family.
The primary family is very,

949
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:37,260
very difficult.
So I can give you an example.

950
00:55:37,261 --> 00:55:39,450
So I had another client,
very bright guy,

951
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:44,140
second generation guy for Middle East
and uh,

952
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:48,390
he was heading for a pretty good career.
Is a smart guy.

953
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,920
Nice.
He'd done a lot of work to get this

954
00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:53,280
career going is in that position that
was difficult to obtain.

955
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:58,020
You had to move to a different city in
order to pursue this career.

956
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:02,790
And his parents were very upset that he
was moving off the street they lived

957
00:56:02,791 --> 00:56:04,440
yet.
Okay.

958
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:09,441
So
from the Western perspective,

959
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:13,860
roughly speaking,
this is where it gets tricky.

960
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,810
The proper thing to do on behalf of the
parents.

961
00:56:18,811 --> 00:56:22,470
Would have been to support him in his
attempts to be to establish himself

962
00:56:22,471 --> 00:56:24,580
independently.
The parent's perspective was,

963
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,730
you're betraying the family by moving
away.

964
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:34,650
Now the question is,
is it reasonable to presume that

965
00:56:34,651 --> 00:56:36,960
independence is an absolute value?
I mean,

966
00:56:36,961 --> 00:56:39,180
we're having words about this.
That's for sure.

967
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,070
The wars have been going on for a long
time.

968
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:45,080
For Rogers.
If you didn't value independence,

969
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,630
you couldn't get going in this form of
therapy.

970
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:53,810
Freud thought that all cultures where
heatable to one degree or another and

971
00:56:54,471 --> 00:56:56,450
you know,
thought that wasn't true for northern

972
00:56:56,451 --> 00:56:57,284
Europeans

973
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:02,460
and that was part of the reason why
Human Freud came to a crossroads.

974
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:08,020
So
think about that.

975
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:10,540
Okay.
In any case,

976
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:14,410
for Roger's only independence value
individually were suited for client

977
00:57:14,411 --> 00:57:18,140
center therapy.
Here's more ECC.

978
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:18,983
Yes.

979
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:23,430
Honest,
can you.

980
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:27,000
You're not another definition of
independence.

981
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:30,440
A
good point.

982
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:33,230
I don't know if you can be completely
consistent with yourself and your

983
00:57:33,231 --> 00:57:34,064
family.

984
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,640
Well that,
that that's a very useful way of the

985
00:57:37,641 --> 00:57:39,620
way.
That's a very useful way of phrasing,

986
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:44,650
phrasing your question.
That's a very useful way of phrasing the

987
00:57:45,561 --> 00:57:46,394
issue.

988
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:47,890
No.

989
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:50,290
Can you be.
If you're honest,

990
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,870
does that mean you're independent?
It's a good question.

991
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:57,710
Might mean that because it means that
you're at least say again from the road

992
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,860
next to take it from the Rogerian
perspective.

993
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:05,440
If you're speaking for yourself now,
that would be yourself in relationship

994
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:07,750
to other people.
The integrate itself,

995
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:10,240
right?
Not the kind of instrumentals useless

996
00:58:10,241 --> 00:58:12,100
self that's wandering around causing
trouble.

997
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:16,060
They're still your.
Your unique position that has to be

998
00:58:16,061 --> 00:58:17,860
contended with.
Right,

999
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:22,090
and the fact that you're your own kind
of bounded entity with its own destiny

1000
00:58:22,091 --> 00:58:26,290
and path and its own particular
biological structure

1001
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,293
and

1002
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:32,790
it's possible that the way that you
define independence is that that

1003
00:58:32,791 --> 00:58:35,670
particular knee is properly integrated
into the collective,

1004
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:39,690
so that's a good.
That's a good issue.

1005
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,240
Okay.
Assuming a minimal natural,

1006
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:47,360
a minimal mutual willingness to be in
contact and to receive communications,

1007
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,420
we may say that the greater the
communicated congruence of experience,

1008
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,150
awareness and behavior on the part of
one individual,

1009
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:58,560
the more the ensuing relationship will
involve a tendency towards reciprocal

1010
00:58:58,561 --> 00:59:02,490
communication with the same qualities,
mutually accurate understanding of the

1011
00:59:02,491 --> 00:59:05,850
communication's improved,
psychological adjustment and functioning

1012
00:59:05,851 --> 00:59:09,780
in both parties and mutual satisfaction.
The relationship pretty good.

1013
00:59:09,781 --> 00:59:13,110
I bought this so basically what he's
saying is that

1014
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,780
if we're communicating and I tell you
what's actually going on with me the

1015
00:59:19,781 --> 00:59:23,390
best I possibly can and try to get rid
of all of the motives that have nothing

1016
00:59:23,391 --> 00:59:28,220
to do with communication,
then that's going to work out quite

1017
00:59:28,221 --> 00:59:31,500
nicely in the long run.
It's gonna work out for both of us and

1018
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:34,340
for the relationship.
It's good.

1019
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,200
It's an interesting hypothesis.

1020
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:42,460
I can tell you that people don't do
this.

1021
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:44,950
You know,
I showed you that Gottman,

1022
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:48,580
I don't know how many of you looked at
that length godman studies on marital

1023
00:59:48,581 --> 00:59:49,480
satisfaction.
Right?

1024
00:59:49,481 --> 00:59:52,030
But I thought that was really
interesting because I've seen people

1025
00:59:52,031 --> 00:59:53,000
like that.
Lots of times,

1026
00:59:53,001 --> 00:59:54,640
you know,
they're on the surface,

1027
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:59,620
everything's fine,
but well sometimes the tension is so

1028
00:59:59,621 --> 01:00:02,270
high you can hardly even stand to be in
the room with the people you know,

1029
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:04,380
because you can just add,
add,

1030
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,340
add,
add an embodied level,

1031
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,960
you're mirroring the distress,
you know,

1032
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:12,010
we get a pit in your stomach,
it's hard to breathe and you just know.

1033
01:00:12,011 --> 01:00:14,470
It's probably smell I think is what it's
trans is,

1034
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:17,320
is what it's communicated by,
you know,

1035
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:21,430
smell affects us and all sorts of ways
we don't understand.

1036
01:00:21,431 --> 01:00:22,540
So here,
here's an example,

1037
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:25,660
women like the smell of tee shirts that
men wore,

1038
01:00:25,661 --> 01:00:28,900
if the men are symmetrical better than
the men aren't symmetrical.

1039
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:32,430
So that's a good example of how smell
affects you,

1040
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:34,480
affects you in lots of weight.
So anyways,

1041
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:40,110
um,
what gartland observed was that

1042
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,970
basically the couples weren't getting
along.

1043
01:00:42,971 --> 01:00:44,740
We're just lying to each other all the
time,

1044
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,050
right?
Because they were pretending that

1045
01:00:47,051 --> 01:00:49,950
everything was all right,
when in fact nothing was already at all.

1046
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,600
Their bodies were going haywire.
That's a technical term,

1047
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:56,770
hayward.
So it was way too stressful for them.

1048
01:00:56,771 --> 01:00:57,820
And you might say,
well,

1049
01:00:57,821 --> 01:01:00,580
why is that bad?
Why shouldn't you be like that?

1050
01:01:00,581 --> 01:01:02,500
Because that's a good question.
Well,

1051
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:05,680
one is if your stress responses are to
elevated,

1052
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,230
we know what happens.
That's the generalized stress response.

1053
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:12,100
Your cortisol levels go up and then,
well then you age the fat,

1054
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:15,310
so if you want to age fast,
that's a very good way of doing it.

1055
01:01:15,311 --> 01:01:19,630
But if that's not your goal,
your goal is peace and harmony.

1056
01:01:19,631 --> 01:01:24,370
Then pretending that everything's all
right without communicating isn't going

1057
01:01:24,371 --> 01:01:27,220
to work.
And so the couples aren't saying things

1058
01:01:27,221 --> 01:01:30,310
like
there's something about the way we're

1059
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:32,350
talking and it's making me extremely
nervous,

1060
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:35,260
you know?
And then actually trying to figure that

1061
01:01:35,261 --> 01:01:35,981
out.
It's like,

1062
01:01:35,981 --> 01:01:36,641
I wouldn't say,
well,

1063
01:01:36,641 --> 01:01:39,160
you're making me nervous because,
well maybe you are,

1064
01:01:39,161 --> 01:01:41,350
but maybe not.
Maybe I'm just a nervous type.

1065
01:01:41,351 --> 01:01:43,810
God only knows.
Let's see if we can sort this out or

1066
01:01:43,811 --> 01:01:45,910
maybe I'm nervous about something else
completely.

1067
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,670
No,
maybe I'm nervous about women.

1068
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,260
So there's lots of digging to do.
Okay.

1069
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,960
So you can think about that and you
think,

1070
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:57,730
well,
is that a reasonable proposition?

1071
01:01:58,900 --> 01:01:59,733
Now

1072
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:03,660
you can try this,
this is an excellent,

1073
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:06,150
this is,
I'm not going to tell you how many

1074
01:02:06,151 --> 01:02:10,200
specific psychological exercises,
but this is a really good one.

1075
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:15,860
It's hard to
reel communicational curves and the

1076
01:02:15,871 --> 01:02:19,290
evaluative tendency avoided when we
listened with understanding,

1077
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:24,560
so the evaluative rogers various is
difficult to understand with regards to

1078
01:02:25,531 --> 01:02:29,730
the relationship between evaluation and
unconditional positive regard because he

1079
01:02:29,731 --> 01:02:32,280
tends to speak as if the evaluation is
bad,

1080
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:35,790
but really what he means is hierarchical
elevate evaluation,

1081
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:38,940
which is your worst that meet or I'm
better than you,

1082
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,150
so like those things might even be true
in any given case,

1083
01:02:42,151 --> 01:02:43,830
but they're not relevant to what we're
doing.

1084
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:45,990
Right?
We're trying to do something other than

1085
01:02:45,991 --> 01:02:47,550
that.
So when that creeps in,

1086
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:51,240
I think about his dominance hierarchy.
Maneuvering not happens all the time.

1087
01:02:51,241 --> 01:02:52,460
When people are talking,
you know,

1088
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:54,990
they're just maneuvering around in a
dominance hierarchy.

1089
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:59,400
They're trying to communicate.
So that's the evaluative tendency.

1090
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:02,340
What does this mean?
It means to see the expressed idea and

1091
01:03:02,341 --> 01:03:06,450
attitude from the other person's point
of view to sense how it feels to him to

1092
01:03:06,451 --> 01:03:09,450
achieve his frame of reference.
In regard to the thing he is talking

1093
01:03:09,451 --> 01:03:14,100
about stated so briefly,
this may sound absurdly simple,

1094
01:03:14,101 --> 01:03:17,070
but it is not.
It's an approach which we have found

1095
01:03:17,071 --> 01:03:19,320
extremely potent in the field of
psychotherapy.

1096
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:22,890
It's the most effective agent we know
for altering the basic personality

1097
01:03:22,891 --> 01:03:26,670
structure of an individual and improving
his relationships and his communications

1098
01:03:26,671 --> 01:03:29,520
with others.
That's a quite the statement.

1099
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:33,180
No,
the most effective agent we know for

1100
01:03:33,181 --> 01:03:35,640
altering the basic personality structure
of an individual.

1101
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:40,200
If I can listen to what he tells me,
if I can understand how it seems to him,

1102
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,420
if I can see it's personal meaning for
him,

1103
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:46,140
if I could sense the emotional flavor
which it has for him,

1104
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:49,470
then I will be releasing potent forces
of change in him.

1105
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,400
If I can really understand how he hates
his father or the university or

1106
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:56,010
economists.
If I could catch the flavor of this

1107
01:03:56,011 --> 01:03:59,520
sphere of insanity or his fear of atom
bombs or of Russia,

1108
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,720
it will be of the greatest help to him
in altering those very hatreds and fears

1109
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:07,130
and in establishing realistic and
harmonious relationships with the very

1110
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:11,040
people and situations toward which he
has felt hatred and fear.

1111
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,430
We know from our research,
by the way,

1112
01:04:14,431 --> 01:04:19,431
Rogers was one of the first clinicians
who empirically evaluated the outcome of

1113
01:04:19,591 --> 01:04:24,591
psychotherapy and so he actually more or
less established the idea that therapy

1114
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:28,330
outcomes should be measured
scientifically and in doing that,

1115
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:32,490
he in some sense,
he set down one element of the standards

1116
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:36,390
by which modern clinical psychologists
are actually trained in practice because

1117
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:41,130
the modern clinical psychologist is a
scientist practitioner.

1118
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:45,390
So the idea is that you should be
trained as a researcher and as a

1119
01:04:45,391 --> 01:04:47,190
practitioner and that's quite unique.

1120
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,020
Doctors,
medical doctors for example,

1121
01:04:49,021 --> 01:04:51,720
are not trained that way.
Although you could make a very strong

1122
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:56,130
case that they should be.
We know from our research that such

1123
01:04:56,131 --> 01:04:58,980
empathic understanding,
understanding with a person,

1124
01:04:58,981 --> 01:05:01,140
not about him.
It's such an effective approach that it

1125
01:05:01,141 --> 01:05:03,210
can bring about major changes in
personality.

1126
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:07,020
Now,
some of you may be feeling that you

1127
01:05:07,021 --> 01:05:10,020
listen well to people and that you've
never seen such results.

1128
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:15,120
The chances are very great indeed that
your listening has not been of the type

1129
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:17,280
I have described.
Fortunately,

1130
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:21,400
I can suggest a little laboratory
experiment which you could try to test

1131
01:05:21,401 --> 01:05:25,270
the quality of your understand the next
time you get into an argument with your

1132
01:05:25,271 --> 01:05:28,720
wife or your friend or with a small
group of friends.

1133
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:33,550
Just stop the discussion for a moment
and for an experiment institute this

1134
01:05:33,551 --> 01:05:36,520
rule.
Each person can only speak up for

1135
01:05:36,521 --> 01:05:41,170
himself once he has first restated the
ideas and feelings of the previous

1136
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:46,171
speaker accurately and to that speaker
satisfaction.

1137
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:48,880
Now,
that's the annoying part,

1138
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,340
right?
Because if you're in an argument,

1139
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:55,530
you're going to use all sorts of
rhetorical devices in order to win.

1140
01:05:55,630 --> 01:06:00,040
One of the most obvious of those
rhetorical devices is that you make your

1141
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:03,790
case and I only half listened because
I'm formulating what I'm going to say to

1142
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:07,480
you next and then I.
I try.

1143
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:12,580
I impose a bias in my processing of your
argument and so that what I addressed

1144
01:06:13,301 --> 01:06:16,360
when I talked to you is the sort of
argument that you'd make if you were

1145
01:06:16,361 --> 01:06:19,840
weak and stupid and contemptible,
and then I go after that and that's

1146
01:06:19,841 --> 01:06:21,460
basically a straw man approach,
right?

1147
01:06:21,461 --> 01:06:23,710
I take your eye,
take your position,

1148
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:28,000
and I try to make it into this scrawny
little rowdiest thing I can possibly

1149
01:06:28,001 --> 01:06:32,320
manage illustrating that it needs to be
rubbed out and then I'd rub it out.

1150
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:36,400
It's like the rigid approaches are
actually exactly the officer by the way.

1151
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,880
It's the approach that Dostoyevsky he
took to his characters when he wrote his

1152
01:06:39,881 --> 01:06:44,200
great novels and it's also the approach
that all great novelists take to their

1153
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:46,450
character.
Because if you're a great novelist,

1154
01:06:46,451 --> 01:06:48,880
you've put yourself inside the hand of
the murderer.

1155
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,520
Right?
And Dostoevsky was created that.

1156
01:06:51,521 --> 01:06:53,590
So in crime and punishment,
for example,

1157
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:58,950
the main character going,
the cough is a lawsuit and he's all

1158
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:03,340
obsessed because he's lost his faith in
God and he's got all these weird ideas

1159
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,480
that emerged in Europe at the end of the
18 hundreds that if there's no god,

1160
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:10,150
everything is permitted.
And so he's thinking,

1161
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,460
well,
my moral just because I'm a coward,

1162
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:14,910
which was a Nietzschean proposition
actually meets.

1163
01:07:14,911 --> 01:07:19,030
You said most morality is cowardice.
He didn't say that morality was

1164
01:07:19,031 --> 01:07:20,140
cowardice.
He said,

1165
01:07:20,141 --> 01:07:22,090
most of the time when people are being
cowardly,

1166
01:07:22,091 --> 01:07:24,460
they pretend that's moral,
which is absolutely right.

1167
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:28,540
Anyways,
he's wrestling with this idea that

1168
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:32,980
morality is just cowardice and that once
fundamental beliefs have disappeared.

1169
01:07:32,981 --> 01:07:35,650
You can do anything you want and the
only thing that's there to stop you is

1170
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:38,440
your own fear.
So that's rattling around in the back of

1171
01:07:38,441 --> 01:07:38,951
his head.
Now,

1172
01:07:38,951 --> 01:07:41,890
at the same time,
he's more or less starving to death and

1173
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:46,330
his sister is going to essentially
prostitute herself to raise enough money

1174
01:07:46,331 --> 01:07:49,480
so that he can stay in law school.
Now it's not exactly that she's going to

1175
01:07:49,481 --> 01:07:52,840
go off and marry this guy that she
doesn't love who's quite rich and she's

1176
01:07:52,841 --> 01:07:54,550
going to do that to keep him in law
school.

1177
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:58,060
So that's sort of sucks,
you know,

1178
01:07:58,061 --> 01:08:01,450
he's not very happy about that.
And then he's living in this horrible

1179
01:08:01,451 --> 01:08:05,780
flop house and the woman who runs it is
Dostoevsky,

1180
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:09,910
sets this up quite nicely.
She's the sort of person that if she was

1181
01:08:09,911 --> 01:08:12,730
run over by a horse cart,
everyone would be pleased.

1182
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,040
She's grasping,
admitted and miserly and horrible and

1183
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:19,220
mean and malevolent and cruel and all
those things.

1184
01:08:19,221 --> 01:08:22,820
And then to make it even worse,
she has this nice who isn't very bright

1185
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:26,660
that she basically treats as a slave and
tortures in orders around all the time.

1186
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:29,420
And then she has all these people who
were living in her building,

1187
01:08:29,421 --> 01:08:32,420
which she doesn't take care of it and
she's just grasping money out of him all

1188
01:08:32,421 --> 01:08:33,860
the time and she doesn't do anything
with money.

1189
01:08:33,861 --> 01:08:38,420
She just puts it in a little chest and
she lives like a on bread crumbs and

1190
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:40,060
dust.
So.

1191
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:43,340
So Dostoyevsky's very careful to set
this situation.

1192
01:08:43,341 --> 01:08:43,911
Not,
it's like,

1193
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:47,240
okay,
is there such a thing as right or wrong?

1194
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:48,820
Well,
Russ Golden,

1195
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,330
the,
these pretty puzzled about that.

1196
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:53,040
Plus he's hungry and he's drinking too
much and you know,

1197
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:55,370
he doesn't eat broccoli.
Well that's why he's hungry.

1198
01:08:55,460 --> 01:09:00,460
So his head is a little on the adult
side and then he's got this terrible

1199
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:02,960
moral conundrum.
It's like there's this horrible woman

1200
01:09:02,961 --> 01:09:06,680
and she's torturing her niece and then
her sister is gonna go into a loveless

1201
01:09:06,681 --> 01:09:09,110
marriage and he can't stay at law
school.

1202
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:11,090
And so we rationalize it.
It says,

1203
01:09:11,091 --> 01:09:12,410
Oh,
here's a solution,

1204
01:09:12,411 --> 01:09:14,630
man.
I'll just get rid of that old woman.

1205
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:17,720
No one's gonna miss her.
Now I'll be doing the world a favor by

1206
01:09:17,721 --> 01:09:22,280
getting rid of her and then I'll take
your money and then my sister doesn't

1207
01:09:22,281 --> 01:09:24,880
have to become a prostitute,
roughly speaking,

1208
01:09:24,881 --> 01:09:27,200
and I get to go to school and I'm going
to be a good guy.

1209
01:09:27,201 --> 01:09:29,060
And so poof.
Perfect.

1210
01:09:29,061 --> 01:09:32,720
And if there's no ultimate right and
wrong and I'm sad,

1211
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:34,610
it's an instrumental argument.
Right?

1212
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,860
Well,
so he kills her.

1213
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:41,440
Well,
and you have to read a book if you want

1214
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:42,283
the rest of the story.

1215
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:47,840
Uh,
suffice it to say that things do not go

1216
01:09:47,841 --> 01:09:51,700
exactly as he predicted.
So the first thing he figures out is

1217
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:54,310
that the person you are before you hit
someone with it,

1218
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,640
someone with an ax and the person you
are immediately after you hit someone

1219
01:09:58,641 --> 01:10:02,720
with an apps are not the same persons.
So you know,

1220
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:07,780
he assumes constancy of identity across
every experience that turns out to be

1221
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:10,820
seriously wrong.
So Dostoevsky man,

1222
01:10:10,821 --> 01:10:13,220
and he does such a,
it's to terrifying book.

1223
01:10:13,221 --> 01:10:15,260
It's the most psychologically accurate
book I ever read,

1224
01:10:15,261 --> 01:10:17,930
I think.
But the reason I'm telling you about it

1225
01:10:17,931 --> 01:10:21,030
is this is what made Dostoevsky so
courageous.

1226
01:10:21,031 --> 01:10:24,440
It's like he,
he generated up a murderer who is

1227
01:10:24,441 --> 01:10:29,441
basically him as a young man and he gave
this kid every reason to murder ever.

1228
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:32,750
And He,
everyone he could think of.

1229
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:36,530
He tried to make the case for murder as
strong as he could possibly make it.

1230
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:38,780
So he wasn't generate,
not some,

1231
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:42,260
you know,
two dimensional bad guy.

1232
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,880
And then he has the,
he has the argument.

1233
01:10:45,881 --> 01:10:47,260
And so that's so brilliant,
right?

1234
01:10:47,261 --> 01:10:50,630
Because if I really want to have a
discussion with you and I want to get

1235
01:10:50,631 --> 01:10:55,631
somewhere wherever somewhere might be,
I want to help you make your argument as

1236
01:10:55,761 --> 01:10:59,960
strong as you can on the off chance that
you have something to say that I don't

1237
01:10:59,961 --> 01:11:04,961
know and maybe you'll do the same to me
and then then we can have the discussion

1238
01:11:06,051 --> 01:11:09,660
and we can get the things solved and
then maybe it won't be around to plague

1239
01:11:09,661 --> 01:11:11,690
us anymore.
Well,

1240
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:14,160
people don't do that in relationships,
you know,

1241
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:17,640
they,
what they do is maintain fragile piece.

1242
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:20,160
And I actually think that probably works
if you're,

1243
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:24,750
if you're bounded by roles,
and this was a union on observation,

1244
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:29,460
so young believer that you didn't have
to have an individual relationship if

1245
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:33,660
you were in a traditional culture
because women did women things and men

1246
01:11:33,661 --> 01:11:38,160
did men things and they walked along the
path in parallel and there were no

1247
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:39,540
conflicts because there were no.

1248
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,590
There were.
But you know,

1249
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:45,570
they're there.
Most of what you were supposed to do was

1250
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,580
laid out for you.
And you know,

1251
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:52,230
monitor people don't like that idea,
but just try negotiating over who should

1252
01:11:52,231 --> 01:11:54,270
do,
who should cook dinner,

1253
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:58,060
see if you set a lap for you,
make a decision about whether the roles

1254
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,670
are useful or not.
Because you know,

1255
01:11:59,671 --> 01:12:03,030
I'd been in lots of houses where that
fight had been going on for 35 years.

1256
01:12:03,370 --> 01:12:06,720
I've never solved.
So camps couldn't eat.

1257
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:10,290
Neo is the food was terrible.
The husband and wife are at each other's

1258
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:11,790
throats,
you know,

1259
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:15,810
fine.
So it's really hard once you're under

1260
01:12:15,811 --> 01:12:17,940
the rules to.
Once you're out of the rules,

1261
01:12:17,941 --> 01:12:20,730
you have to do it as an individual.
But that's a trek.

1262
01:12:20,731 --> 01:12:23,190
Tremendous demand.
It's an unbelievable demand.

1263
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:27,030
It's the same demand that essentially
that Dostoyevsky he put on himself.

1264
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:31,530
It's like
we're partners will say you are one

1265
01:12:31,531 --> 01:12:36,531
weird and unwieldy and malevolent and
peculiar creature and so alive.

1266
01:12:36,571 --> 01:12:39,690
So like how the hell are we going to
sort that out?

1267
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:44,010
Well,
you better be awake if you're going to

1268
01:12:44,011 --> 01:12:45,540
sort that out.
And then.

1269
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:47,790
But the alternative is the Gottman
situation,

1270
01:12:47,791 --> 01:12:49,350
right?
Everything's fine.

1271
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:53,370
And your heart's racing and your
cortisol is generating and you know

1272
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:58,640
you're having murderous dreams.
I've had clients who were very motivated

1273
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:03,780
to commit homicide and they had their
reasons and one client I'm thinking

1274
01:13:03,781 --> 01:13:06,840
about,
she thought it was her moral duty to do

1275
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:11,841
this because the person that she hated
had really hurt their family.

1276
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:16,740
Like not in some trivial way but like
hurt them as badly as she possibly

1277
01:13:16,741 --> 01:13:19,350
could,
but there was nothing she could do about

1278
01:13:19,351 --> 01:13:21,840
it.
There was no legal recourse and so she

1279
01:13:21,841 --> 01:13:23,550
was a very moral person.

1280
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:28,840
In fact,
somewhat I would say it doesn't matter.

1281
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,860
She's a very moral person and this was
just driving her crazy.

1282
01:13:31,861 --> 01:13:33,540
It's like I have to act,
I have to act.

1283
01:13:33,541 --> 01:13:36,750
I can't just let this person get away
with it because it was also ongoing.

1284
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:39,660
Well,
but what are you going to say?

1285
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,550
Well,
stop thinking about that.

1286
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,310
You know,
you could put your thoughts to a more

1287
01:13:44,311 --> 01:13:45,660
productive use.
It's like,

1288
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:47,280
it's not unhelpful,
but you can't.

1289
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:50,210
You can't help a person like that at all
until you put your.

1290
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:52,380
You put yourself in their situation.
You think,

1291
01:13:52,381 --> 01:13:54,960
okay,
if I was in that situation and that had

1292
01:13:54,961 --> 01:13:57,000
happened,
what would I do?

1293
01:13:57,001 --> 01:13:58,620
And then the first thing I thought was,
oh,

1294
01:13:58,621 --> 01:14:03,210
I'd be having the same kind of burgers
fantasies so that that doesn't seem like

1295
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,550
it's possible that that's not a great
solution.

1296
01:14:05,551 --> 01:14:07,200
So let's see if we can come up with
something else.

1297
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:11,710
But the danger there is that you have to
put yourself in that situation and

1298
01:14:11,711 --> 01:14:13,300
people don't like to do that because
they think,

1299
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:13,571
oh,
well,

1300
01:14:13,571 --> 01:14:18,460
I've never had murdered his fantasies.
So like if you would never have

1301
01:14:18,461 --> 01:14:20,740
murderous fantasies,
I would actually say there's something

1302
01:14:20,741 --> 01:14:24,160
wrong with you.
If you're not capable of that,

1303
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:26,860
then there's like there's a path of you
missing.

1304
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:29,350
It's in there man.
And when,

1305
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,480
when,
when someone's pushing on you at some

1306
01:14:31,481 --> 01:14:35,020
point in your life and they will,
you better have that reserve capacity or

1307
01:14:35,021 --> 01:14:36,580
they're just going to mow you right
over.

1308
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:42,390
So you could see what this would mean.
It would simply mean that before

1309
01:14:43,421 --> 01:14:46,300
presenting your own point of view,
it would be necessary for you to really

1310
01:14:46,301 --> 01:14:50,080
achieve the other speakers frame of
reference to understand his thoughts and

1311
01:14:50,081 --> 01:14:53,530
feeling so well that you could summarize
them for him.

1312
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:55,300
Sounds simple,
doesn't it?

1313
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:58,330
But if you try it,
you will discover it as one of the most

1314
01:14:58,331 --> 01:15:02,530
difficult things I've ever tried to do.
However,

1315
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,530
once you have been able to see the
other's point of view,

1316
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:08,320
your own comments will have to be
drastically revised.

1317
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:11,800
You will also find the emotion going out
of the discussion,

1318
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:16,010
the differences being reduced and those
differences which renamed being under

1319
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:17,800
rational and understandable sore.

1320
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,910
So Roger's thought that courage was a
prerequisite for empathic understanding.

1321
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:28,930
It's interesting too,
because you know here,

1322
01:15:28,931 --> 01:15:30,610
here's a.
here's a question for you.

1323
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:35,730
It's like check you trust people
or more specifically,

1324
01:15:35,951 --> 01:15:37,360
you know,
should I trust you?

1325
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:41,560
Well,
you might think if you've heard me talk,

1326
01:15:41,561 --> 01:15:42,191
you'd think,
well,

1327
01:15:42,191 --> 01:15:45,310
there's no way you should trust a person
because they're just so full of snakes

1328
01:15:45,311 --> 01:15:48,130
and malevolence that it's just
absolutely mind boggling.

1329
01:15:48,131 --> 01:15:50,950
So why in the world would you ever trust
something like that?

1330
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:53,140
Well then you can think about it this
way.

1331
01:15:53,141 --> 01:15:55,570
There's two kinds of trust.
There's the kind of trust you have when

1332
01:15:55,571 --> 01:15:58,210
you're too stupid to know better and
that's not trust,

1333
01:15:58,211 --> 01:16:02,320
that's naive and that is not a moral
virtue and there's the kind of trust you

1334
01:16:02,321 --> 01:16:05,710
have when you know that the person your
car can do and you are completely full

1335
01:16:05,711 --> 01:16:10,570
of snakes and you decide as an act of
courage that you're going to trust the

1336
01:16:10,571 --> 01:16:15,571
person anyways because that of all the
things you could do to help lead them

1337
01:16:15,881 --> 01:16:18,760
and the discussion towards the light,
that's the most important.

1338
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:23,930
It's like I'm going to assume that in
our interactions,

1339
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:28,090
your impulse towards the good is going
to be victorious.

1340
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:31,450
Now isn't if you're interested in this,
you could go online,

1341
01:16:31,451 --> 01:16:34,570
you can watch Paul Bernardo,
you remember Old Paul Bernardo.

1342
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:37,510
Okay.
There's videos of Paul Bernardo online

1343
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:41,560
when he's talking to a bunch of RCMP
officers and judges.

1344
01:16:41,561 --> 01:16:45,250
They're trying to extract some more
information from him about some murders

1345
01:16:45,251 --> 01:16:48,430
that remained unsolved.
You want to see a psychopath,

1346
01:16:48,431 --> 01:16:51,040
that operation,
you can just watch those videos.

1347
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,560
It's amazing.
He,

1348
01:16:52,590 --> 01:16:55,150
he runs the meeting like he's the CEO of
Apple.

1349
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:57,580
It's amazing.
So.

1350
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,970
And that's a problem I would say to some
degree for the Rogerian approach,

1351
01:17:00,971 --> 01:17:01,804
right?
Because.

1352
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:04,240
Well,
what about Paul Bernardo,

1353
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:09,160
you know,
is everyone fundamentally oriented

1354
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:10,910
towards the good?
Well,

1355
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:17,450
it's a reasonable presupposition.
Most of the time I think it works better

1356
01:17:17,451 --> 01:17:20,210
if society is organized themselves
according to that principal because

1357
01:17:20,211 --> 01:17:21,470
otherwise we know,
for example,

1358
01:17:21,471 --> 01:17:26,300
that one of the mite thing,
what's a natural resource oil,

1359
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:27,290
right?

1360
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:32,290
For a
box site or iron ore or forget about all

1361
01:17:32,370 --> 01:17:36,020
that.
The fundamental natural resource is

1362
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:39,650
trust.
So if you look around the world and you

1363
01:17:39,651 --> 01:17:41,660
look at economies like Japan,
for example,

1364
01:17:41,661 --> 01:17:43,550
Japan has no natural resources,
right?

1365
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:45,920
While they're filthy rich.
Why?

1366
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:50,240
Because the economy is basically
predicated on interpersonal trust.

1367
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:55,040
So when there's been some lovely work
done in economics regarding precisely

1368
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:57,770
that without trust,
your oil just sits in the ground or it

1369
01:17:57,771 --> 01:18:00,590
leaks out of the pipelines because
nobody weld with the property.

1370
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,660
You know,
there isn't.

1371
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:06,380
There's no reason to assume that you're
going to be able to do anything

1372
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:10,100
cooperative or collaborative,
so trust is a necessity if you're really

1373
01:18:10,101 --> 01:18:12,170
willing to understand the person in this
way.

1374
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:15,770
If you're willing to enter his private
world at see the way life appears to

1375
01:18:15,771 --> 01:18:17,900
him,
you run the risk of being changed

1376
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:18,734
yourself.

1377
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:22,340
You might see it his way.
You might find yourself influenced in

1378
01:18:22,341 --> 01:18:26,600
your attitudes or personality.
Risk of being changed is one of the most

1379
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:28,640
frightening prospects most of us can
face.

1380
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:32,240
If I enter as fully as I am able into
the private world.

1381
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:36,320
If the neurotic or psychotic individual
isn't there a risk that I might become

1382
01:18:36,321 --> 01:18:39,980
lost in that world,
most of us are afraid to take that risk.

1383
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:45,310
The great majority of us cannot listen.
We find ourselves compelled to evaluate

1384
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:49,820
because listening is too dangerous.
The first requirement is courage and we

1385
01:18:49,821 --> 01:18:54,821
do not always have it,
so it says 3:00 on this.

1386
01:18:58,570 --> 01:19:00,180
That right.
Well,

1387
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:01,550
that's a good place to start.
There.
