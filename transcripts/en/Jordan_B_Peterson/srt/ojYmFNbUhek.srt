1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,583
Hi everybody.
So first I'd like to thank all of my 

2
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:08,070
viewers and listeners for their 
attention and support.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,100
It's been absolutely overwhelming.
I still haven't reconciled myself to it,

4
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:14,124
but so far so good.
And I hope to continue to produce 

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,773
content that strikes a chord.
And I would also like to thank my 

6
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:26,460
patrons supporters who have been 
extraordinarily generous and helpful and

7
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:27,294
whose support has enabled many of the 
projects that I'm going to discuss 

8
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:31,704
today.
So here's what's been happening and 

9
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:35,250
what's going to happen over the next 
couple of months.

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,443
The first thing I'd like to announce is 
the release today of my new youtube 

11
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:44,520
channel called Jordan B.
Peterson clips.

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,620
It will feature clips that are five to 
15 minutes long,

13
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:50,454
some of which will be original and some 
of which will be derived from youtube 

14
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:58,191
videos that have already been posted.
It's not obvious what the optimal length

15
00:00:58,561 --> 00:00:59,880
is for a youtube video.

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,713
It's new technology.
And so my team and I are experimenting 

17
00:01:03,721 --> 00:01:07,500
with videos of different lengths to see 
what might be optimal.

18
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,830
So we plan to release two to three 
videos a week on that.

19
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:11,521
And so,
uh,

20
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:12,354
that's Jordan B.
Peterson clips and thank you to Gillian 

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,230
Vardy who's going to be my daughter in 
law.

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,190
She's engaged to my son Julian,
who's also helping on this project.

23
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:21,024
And also my daughter Mikayla,
who is about to have a baby in about a 

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,313
week.
So they're all doing the editing and 

25
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:27,564
setting up the channel.
And so thank you very much to them for 

26
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:32,940
the hard work.
And so that's the first announcement.

27
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,510
The second thing I would like to 
announce is the release,

28
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:37,344
sometimes later this month of a new 
website that will enable students to 

29
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,683
enter their course descriptions of their
university courses and perhaps their 

30
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,800
high school courses as well,
along with the professor's name,

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,290
the discipline and the university.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,393
And the website has an artificial 
intelligence corps that will do a 

33
00:01:57,811 --> 00:01:58,644
linguistic analysis of the content of 
the course description and rate it as 

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,640
postmodern,
neo,

35
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:04,474
Marxist or not.
And so if you're interested in taking 

36
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:08,034
postmodern neo Marxist courses in the 
university and undergoing that pathway 

37
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:16,440
of cult like indoctrination,
then you can use the website to do that.

38
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:21,441
And if you'd like to avoid that and get 
yourself a classical education and learn

39
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:22,554
to speak and write and communicate and 
thank and familiarize yourself with the 

40
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:29,040
great works of civilization,
then you can use it to do that.

41
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,460
So we're hoping that that will be an 
extraordinarily useful website.

42
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,413
And the overarching goal in part 
facilitated by that website is to cut 

43
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:37,434
the enrollment in postmodern Neil 
Marxist courses of indoctrination in 

44
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:45,540
university across the Western world by 
75% over the next five years.

45
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,850
So that's announcement number two.

46
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,643
Announcement number three is that we're 
going to release a psychometrically 

47
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:56,430
valid personality test called the big 
five aspects scale,

48
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,740
and it's online form within the next 
month.

49
00:02:58,741 --> 00:02:59,574
So you'll be able to go there and do a 
five factor analysis of your own 

50
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:06,340
personality that will give you your 
ratings for extroversion,

51
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,320
neuroticism,
agreeableness,

52
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,273
conscientiousness and openness,
as well as breaking each of those down 

53
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:16,300
into two aspects.
So for extroversion,

54
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:20,140
that's assertiveness and enthusiasm.
For neuroticism,

55
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:22,990
it's withdrawal and volatility.
For agreeableness,

56
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:26,260
it's compassion and politeness for 
openness,

57
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,123
its openness proper,
which is interest in aesthetics and 

58
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,480
interest in ideas.
That's intellect.

59
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:32,314
So openness will break down into 
openness and intellect and finally 

60
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:38,470
conscientiousness into industriousness 
and orderliness.

61
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,603
And that will enable you to receive a 
report on your personality that will 

62
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:43,324
detail how you compare to other people 
in terms of a percentile on each of 

63
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:50,950
those five major trait dimensions and 
the 10 subsidiary dimensions.

64
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,700
We will also soon after release a 
couples or dyad form of the same test so

65
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:58,294
that once you take the test,
you can have a friend take it or a 

66
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:06,100
sister or a brother or a child or a 
parent or an employee for that matter.

67
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,863
And it will give you each a report on 
your respective personalities but will 

68
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:12,154
also inform you as to your similarities 
and differences and where you were 

69
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:15,484
clashing,
where you won't and what the basis for 

70
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,720
your misunderstandings might be and how 
to work through them.

71
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,670
And so that's the third announcement.
And then for the fourth announcement,

72
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,533
you may know that we've already created 
a set of programs called the self 

73
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:32,500
authoring suite that helps adults right 
about their past experiences,

74
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,320
analyze their personalities in written 
form.

75
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,183
That's different than getting a 
personality report and make a plan for 

76
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:39,724
the future.
The future authoring program has helped 

77
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:43,384
university students increase the 
probability of staying in their courses 

78
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:50,200
by about 30% and increased their grade 
point averages by about 25%.

79
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,303
We're going to release a high school 
version of that at the beginning of 

80
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,233
September.
So we're really looking forward to that 

81
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:58,780
and that that will take elements of the 
past authoring,

82
00:04:58,781 --> 00:04:59,614
president authoring and future authoring
and make them all accessible to high 

83
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:02,974
school students who will be asked to 
look three to six months down the road 

84
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,410
in terms of character development and 
future plans.

85
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:09,963
And then finally,
I'm just putting the finishing touches 

86
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:14,410
on my book,
12 rules for life,

87
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,603
an antidote to chaos,
which will be published by Penguin 

88
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,480
Random House Canada and released January
9th,

89
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,313
2018.
And I'm hoping that that book will 

90
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,503
provide further background information 
regarding the sorts of things that I've 

91
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:32,620
been discussing in my youtube lectures,
including the biblical series and uh,

92
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:37,770
provide an introduction to my ideas that
substantially more straightforward and,

93
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,180
and public friendly,
let's say.

94
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:42,040
Then my previous book,
maps of meaning.

95
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,320
So that's the announcement stream.

96
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,670
So here,
here it all is.

97
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:48,460
In summary,
I've launched a new youtube channel,

98
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,590
Jordan B.
Peterson clips.

99
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,900
Uh,
there'll be three to five videos a week.

100
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:55,270
Going up on that.
From five to five minutes long,

101
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,223
we're going to launch a postmodern 
Marxists content analyzer and consumer 

102
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:04,730
information site for university students
who wish to avoid being indoctrinated by

103
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,520
the radical leftists who've taken over 
the humanities.

104
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:08,354
And we're hoping that that will help 
transform the universities back into 

105
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:12,590
something approximating what they should
be.

106
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,650
We're going to release the big five 
aspect scale,

107
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:19,280
which will enable people to get an 
accurate indication of their personality

108
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,930
along the big five dimensions and also 
break each of the big five down into two

109
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,913
canonical aspects.
We've developed a high school self 

110
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:29,900
authoring suite that should come out in 
September,

111
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:33,110
that'll help high school students write 
about themselves and understand who they

112
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:37,130
are and start planning for the future.
And I'm putting the finishing touches on

113
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,440
my book,
12 rules for life,

114
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,603
an antidote to chaos that's already 
available by the way for preorder at 

115
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:45,320
Amazon.
So,

116
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,154
uh,
thank you very much and I hope that you 

117
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:49,094
enjoyed the new channel and also that 
you find these programs that we're 

118
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:53,474
developing useful and practical and that
they help you put yourselves together 

119
00:06:57,471 --> 00:07:02,471
and lead productive and meaningful and 
high quality lives with the least amount

120
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:06,680
of tragedy and suffering possible.
That would be really good.

121
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,220
So thanks very much.
Bye.

122
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,054
Bye.
