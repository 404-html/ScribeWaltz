1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,620
Yeah.
And now I get dry in into a dive.

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,980
I worked for Svenska dog about,
which is a newspaper,

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:07,903
one of the,
the second largest with daily 

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,763
circulations.
And then I ask sometimes on twitter and 

5
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:13,784
facebook,
what kind of people you think I should 

6
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:19,010
interview?
And your name has come up a lot.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,590
I think you've heard this before.
So,

8
00:00:21,591 --> 00:00:23,030
uh,
and then,

9
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:25,640
uh,
recently I wrote a piece in

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,750
a freedom in,
in Sweden and,

11
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,710
and you shared it on twitter and 
facebook.

12
00:00:33,711 --> 00:00:34,544
So then I,
that's when I may leave because then I 

13
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:39,560
thought that perhaps now I have a 
perhaps now you will respond.

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,150
I can get me into you.

15
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,190
Yeah.
Well cool.

16
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:47,380
Apt is really turned out to be quite,
quite the platform man.

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,310
You know what I mean?
It's,

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,360
it's,
I'm really,

19
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,330
I did an interview with Claire Lehmann.
I interviewed her,

20
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,730
um,
which I haven't released yet.

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,593
Uh,
but I,

22
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,420
but we'll in the next probably two 
weeks,

23
00:00:59,421 --> 00:01:00,980
something like that.
But,

24
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:04,400
um,
she's hitting it out of the park is fall

25
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:05,234
as far as I'm concerned.
It kind of reminds me of what magazine 

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,740
Leica Harper's used to be,
or at the Atlantic before

27
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,390
for mainstream journalism collapsed 
virtually,

28
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:21,470
completely and became so politicized.
So yeah,

29
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,240
it's cool.
It's been really impressive.

30
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,800
It's fun.
That's something that,

31
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,980
uh,
like a mother of two or one

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,553
and just being fed up with the political
correctness of her psychology 

33
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:40,630
department,
I think it was.

34
00:01:40,631 --> 00:01:41,464
And then she starts quill it and now 
we're all like sharing in her project 

35
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:46,880
from all over the world.
Yeah.

36
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,380
Yeah.
It's amazing.

37
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,330
It's really amazing.
And she,

38
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,550
well,
she has really good editorial sense.

39
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,070
She must be really smart that,
that girl.

40
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,370
Yeah,

41
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,830
I would say so too.
Uh,

42
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,693
but,
uh,

43
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,090
I'll try,
I don't know if you remember,

44
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,210
I'll just begin by asking you about the 
Sweden Sweden case.

45
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,510
I don't know if you remember what the 
article was about,

46
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:12,000
but I wrote about,
uh,

47
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,893
Eric Green Murray is a professor at the 
political science department and he was 

48
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,840
forced to include,
uh,

49
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,960
Judith Butler.
Butler.

50
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,770
Oh yeah.
Right.

51
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:24,920
Judith Butler.
Yeah.

52
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,783
Yeah.

53
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,470
Great.
And,

54
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:28,304
uh,
the course is about modern society and 

55
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:32,570
its,
and its critics.

56
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:37,220
So it's basically about the reactionary 
forces and uh,

57
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,170
left wing extremist forces during the 
turn of the last century.

58
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,730
So in the early 20th century,
late 19th century.

59
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,330
And then you riff butler.
Um,

60
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,540
and actually one of the course,
not Eric,

61
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,630
but uh,
his,

62
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,270
um,
his teaching assistant interviewed

63
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,840
and she said that she disagreed with 
the,

64
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,563
so she agreed with the professors that 
Chili Cheese thought that the academic 

65
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:07,290
freedom was more yeah.
Important than,

66
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,124
uh,
being forced to teach about feminist 

67
00:03:11,221 --> 00:03:13,890
authors and gender science.
So she was actually

68
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,750
on the other side.
Gender Science.

69
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,801
Yeah,
exactly.

70
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:20,950
Or is by no means a scientist or even a 
credible academic?

71
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:24,010
As far as I'm concerned,
I think she's a straight out idealog and

72
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,433
um,
and the fact that anybody would be 

73
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:27,940
forced,
well,

74
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:28,774
first of all forced to include anything 
on their curriculum I think is 

75
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,313
absolutely reprehensible.
It's topped down interference with 

76
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:35,554
academic freedom and it's 
extraordinarily dangerous because once 

77
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:42,370
that
precedent is established,

78
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,030
then you open the door for political 
interference in the,

79
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,893
like,
I like organized political interference 

80
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:53,240
from outside the academy and it'll 
collapse very rapidly under.

81
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:54,074
Sir,
we saw that happening in Germany and 

82
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:56,044
also in the Soviet Union.
It like that can happen so quickly that 

83
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:01,350
people can't,
can't,

84
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:02,883
it's almost impossible to believe.
Now we're in this weird situation where 

85
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,453
the same thing seems to be happening to 
a large degree within the academy 

86
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:12,220
itself.
And so,

87
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,280
and what to do about that is by no means
obvious,

88
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:20,281
but,
but I don't think that allowing external

89
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:21,214
control of any sort over the contents of
the courses the professor teach 

90
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,100
professors teach is,
it's a very,

91
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,120
very bad idea.

92
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,180
We,
they have a rule,

93
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,350
rule of thumb they call it,
but it's basically,

94
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:34,184
it's much more a rule.
And the rule of thumb that at least 40% 

95
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:40,200
of all the literature has to be written 
by women.

96
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,100
So unbelievable.
If you're holding a course,

97
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,143
for example,
about modern society and its critic 

98
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,820
critics with a lot of primary literature
from turn of the century,

99
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,730
then you run into a problem because 
women weren't,

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,833
uh,
so,

101
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,793
uh,
we weren't a lot of women who were 

102
00:04:57,541 --> 00:04:58,410
authors back them.

103
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,120
So unbelievably,
I would say resentful.

104
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,120
I really think that's the fundamental 
issue here.

105
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,620
To push a doctor resentful and 
uninformed to push a doctrine like that.

106
00:05:12,621 --> 00:05:14,620
Look,
it's unbelievably widespread.

107
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,660
So I'll give you an example that's very,
that's very similar.

108
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:18,943
Our Prime Minister,
Justin Trudeau announced in 2015 that 

109
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:24,080
half the cabinet that he put together 
would be women,

110
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,050
right?
The fact that only approximately,

111
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:30,710
I think it was 20 to 25% of the elected 
officials were female.

112
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,230
And so what he basically admitted,
as far as I'm concerned,

113
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,060
it was two things.
Number one,

114
00:05:38,061 --> 00:05:38,894
he was incapable of judging people on 
their competence because when you put 

115
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:45,120
together something like the cabinet for 
a country,

116
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,730
what you do is you find the most 
competent people,

117
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,840
period.
Because

118
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,173
it's so bizarre that it even has to be 
said because it actually turns out that 

119
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:57,380
the cabinet is important.
And so to me,

120
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:58,214
all he did was default on his,
said his central moral obligation to 

121
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:07,160
screen every single one of his members 
of parliament with exceeding care and to

122
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:08,780
pick the most qualified people.

123
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,370
And his rationale was that it was 2015,
you know,

124
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,263
so,
and we to reduce competence to racial 

125
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:21,090
ethnic,
gender identity,

126
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:26,091
something like that is an absolutely 
appalling move philosophically as well,

127
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,233
as far as I'm concerned,
to assume that diversity is somehow 

128
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:32,520
represented by group membership.
There's no evidence for that.

129
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,550
There's absolutely no scientific 
evidence for that whatsoever.

130
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:36,384
In fact,
the scientific evidence suggest quite 

131
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:39,144
the contrary,
which is that there's more variability 

132
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,920
within groups than there is between 
groups,

133
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,520
which is actually an antidote to the 
central racist claim,

134
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:49,440
right.
Because the central racist claim is,

135
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:53,100
there's more difference between groups 
than there is difference within them.

136
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,450
And so,
you know,

137
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,880
you seen one black person,
you've seen them all.

138
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,850
Yeah.
And Wow,

139
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,293
well this is,
we actually have in Sweden it's called 

140
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,070
the,
I think the procedure is,

141
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,180
um,
gender mainstreaming in,

142
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,350
in English.
But,

143
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:14,730
um,
uh,

144
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,610
basically you have to include a gender 
scientific perspectives,

145
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,813
uh,
into all this is happening within all 

146
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:26,220
Swedish universities right now.
Uh,

147
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,180
so you have to include the perspective 
of gender,

148
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,100
gender,
scientific,

149
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:31,963
gender,
scientific perspective in all parts of 

150
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:34,994
the university.
So it's not just literature lists of 

151
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:37,754
courses,
it's also the who are you going to 

152
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,190
recruit?
And we have a goal in Sweden and,

153
00:07:44,191 --> 00:07:45,510
uh,
from the government.

154
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,710
This is all the government's doing.
MMM.

155
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:54,680
We have a goal that I think it's 40% of 
all the professors,

156
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,730
uh,
by 2020,

157
00:07:56,731 --> 00:07:57,564
they should be women.

158
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,543
Right.
Which means that if you're a young man 

159
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,430
who's entering academia,
the probability that you're going to get

160
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:05,460
a job as zero.
Yeah.

161
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,250
Right.
And that,

162
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,630
yeah,
the same thing's happening here.

163
00:08:07,631 --> 00:08:08,800
So for example,
this,

164
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,970
they're our minister of science who was 
one of the people,

165
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,943
let's say selected because of Trudeau's 
insistence upon gender equity in his 

166
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:19,910
cabinet.
Um,

167
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,210
you know,
he could have,

168
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,513
pick a number of women that was 
proportionate to the number of women 

169
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:27,414
elected.
Like even that I wouldn't have agreed 

170
00:08:29,431 --> 00:08:31,870
with because I think he should've gone 
on street competence and,

171
00:08:31,871 --> 00:08:32,704
and,
and taken on the heavy moral burden of 

172
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:35,940
trying to figure out what competence 
meant,

173
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,000
but just,
but no,

174
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:41,520
it had to be 50 50 because I guess that 
was,

175
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,380
you know,
this is a very snide thing to say,

176
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:44,214
but that seems to be at the level of 
arithmetic intelligence that he could 

177
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,424
manifest.

178
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,893
You know,
it's,

179
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,390
and,
and one of his ministers,

180
00:08:51,391 --> 00:08:54,390
our Minister of science has,
we have this program called camp.

181
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,283
The Canada chairs in the Canada research
chairs were set up so that Canadian 

182
00:08:59,041 --> 00:08:59,874
universities would have an additional 
amount of money to hire the most 

183
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:07,320
qualified people they possibly could for
senior named chair positions.

184
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,590
And the idea was to attract 
international talent,

185
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,470
like high level.
Now what has happened,

186
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,333
because it wasn't very well designed,
this program was the Canadian 

187
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:19,260
universities mostly ended up poaching 
from each other,

188
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,880
which was,
you know,

189
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,743
relatively counterproductive because it 
just elevated the salaries of the 

190
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:25,434
professors,
which maybe they deserve rather than 

191
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:28,920
bringing in a lot of international 
talent.

192
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,053
But man,
we're radically overrepresented in the 

193
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:32,994
Canada research chairs now.
The administer of science is very 

194
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:36,864
annoyed about this and thinks that 
that's a consequence of systemic 

195
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,330
misogyny or some some bloody thing.

196
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,430
Failing to note entirely.
See,

197
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,510
if you look at scientific productivity,
it's very interesting because,

198
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,300
and gender,
the median professor,

199
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,160
male and female publish approximately 
the same amount.

200
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,710
So the typical,
but the,

201
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,340
the exceptional professors are almost 
all men who even though the typical male

202
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:07,200
and female can't really be distinguished
in academia,

203
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:10,740
if you take that tiny subset of hyper 
productive professors,

204
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:11,574
they're almost all male.
Now why that is is my suspicions are 

205
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,893
that it's pretty straight forward.
I suspect that the reason it is is 

206
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:18,804
because to be a hyper productive in any 
given field means you have to be 

207
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,483
absolutely single minded and obsessed 
about it as well as being very 

208
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:28,170
intelligent,
conscientious.

209
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,280
So it's rare,
right?

210
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,900
You have to be intelligent,
say 99th percentile,

211
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,870
conscientious,
95th percentile.

212
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:38,670
So that's hard.
The anybody right there.

213
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,880
And then you have to have the time 
available to do nothing whatsoever,

214
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:45,630
but concentrate on your work.

215
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,760
No family,
no friends,

216
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:50,250
nothing like that.
If you're going to be at the very top of

217
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:51,084
your profession,
because obviously you'll get out 

218
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:54,894
competed otherwise.
Now that's a lot harder for women 

219
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,090
because,
well for obvious reasons.

220
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,433
I mean so,
so the mere fact that most of these 

221
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:05,184
people were,
see the other thing people don't 

222
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:10,770
understand is that people can on average
be very similar.

223
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,000
So their distributions,
but if you go way out on to the edges of

224
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:17,970
the distribution,
small differences in the middle can make

225
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:21,270
massive differences at the edge.
And so,

226
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:22,104
and that's the kind of phenomena you see
where you are selecting the highest 

227
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:25,850
qualified people.
It's a,

228
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,230
it's an edge of the distribution 
phenomena.

229
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:30,180
So here's an example.
This is really cool one.

230
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,350
So if you look at the overlap between 
male and female aggression,

231
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,573
it's pretty high.
So if you randomly select a man and a 

232
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:38,934
woman from the general population and 
you bet that the woman was the more 

233
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:45,480
aggressive of the two,
you'd be right 40% of the time,

234
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,550
which is actually pretty often.

235
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,780
So,
but if you go way the hell out to where,

236
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,780
let's say only imprisoned the one in 100
most aggressive people,

237
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,280
they're all men.
Yeah.

238
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,950
Even though on average,
you know,

239
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:02,940
it's 60,
40,

240
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,930
you'd go out to the 99th percentile.
It's all men.

241
00:12:06,931 --> 00:12:10,220
Which is why almost all the people in 
prison are men now.

242
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,190
So people,
well it's,

243
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,860
it's,
yeah,

244
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,910
what you're describing in Sweden,
that's the death of the universities.

245
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:19,950
It's another,
it's another sign of like,

246
00:12:19,951 --> 00:12:20,784
the universities are killing themselves.
They're hiring adjunct professors and 

247
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:24,414
not faculty members.
Like I think it's up to 70% in some 

248
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:29,630
American universities.
They have no salary,

249
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,280
no power,
no autonomy,

250
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,380
no job security,
nothing.

251
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,101
It's,
it's,

252
00:12:34,101 --> 00:12:35,360
it's,
you know,

253
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:39,170
some of these adjuncts teach four or 
five courses a year and make $25,000.

254
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,800
So it's,
I read about one who lived in her car.

255
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:45,451
Yeah.
Okay,

256
00:12:45,451 --> 00:12:49,710
so they've jacked up tuition.
Proletariat.

257
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,800
Yeah,
exactly.

258
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,150
Well there you go.
You know,

259
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,533
um,

260
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,720
if jacked up tuition,

261
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,463
oh,
they've jacked up tuition to the point 

262
00:12:59,581 --> 00:13:00,414
where it's unsustainable.
They've made it impossible for kids who 

263
00:13:03,611 --> 00:13:06,280
rack up tuition debt to declare 
bankruptcy.

264
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,610
Because they've taken that out of the 
bankruptcy laws.

265
00:13:08,611 --> 00:13:11,640
Now you can take away their driver's 
license if they don't pay their,

266
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,913
their,
uh,

267
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,450
their tuition,
their student loan bills.

268
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,420
So it's basically indentured servitude,
right?

269
00:13:18,421 --> 00:13:21,030
The administration has become completely
top heavy.

270
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,193
The academy is completely infested by 
these terrible equity ideas that you're 

271
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:28,560
laying out.
I mean,

272
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,863
and,
and the people who are in the radical 

273
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,760
leftists disciplines,
which increasingly are spreading there,

274
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,200
influence out through the entire 
universities,

275
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,590
are tenured and won't be moved for 25 
years.

276
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,020
So as far as I can tell,
it's,

277
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,433
it's done,

278
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,550
would like to ask you,
Oh,

279
00:13:49,551 --> 00:13:50,384
you take about on gender science and all
these sort of like ethnic studies and 

280
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,653
theology.
Because I was a sociology student back 

281
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:01,380
in 2004,
and I was 22 years old.

282
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:07,050
And so a lot of these perspectives,
we were taught postmodernism and queer,

283
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,320
queer feminism and all these things.
And it was,

284
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,780
I mean,
I was just starting out as a student,

285
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,210
so I,
but I,

286
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,550
I must have been wired for faulty 
because he didn't,

287
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:20,300
uh,
I was very critical about it.

288
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,370
But,
but all those perspectives was,

289
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,950
uh,
was back then was fringe in Sweden.

290
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,220
So like,
um,

291
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,323
like identity politics or everything 
that's now in the mainstream was at the 

292
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,190
institution back then.
And the professors,

293
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,520
they were,
they are the same.

294
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,950
I mean they are now,
it's their,

295
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:47,970
their phds and most of the students that
are taking over the public discourse,

296
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:50,563
uh,
so even they lost a lot of debate back 

297
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:56,230
then and they still do like public 
debates.

298
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,160
They're still teaching students year 
after year of the year.

299
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:07,310
The students should ask you about that 
and also about your,

300
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:11,510
your critique of gender,
gender studies in Swedish,

301
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:15,560
it's called gender science because we 
turn all this into science.

302
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,190
So it's not even studies,
it's science here.

303
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,400
That was a good move on the,
on the,

304
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,630
on the ideologues parts,
that's for sure.

305
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:25,883
Really smart.

306
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,630
So it's a two pronged question,
but

307
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,283
yeah,
well I think,

308
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,780
well,
I listed about seven things I think that

309
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,410
are killing me.
Universities.

310
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:40,490
I actually think that I've watched major
institutions collapse and being privy to

311
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:44,870
the manner in which that occurs.
Like what happens is that as the

312
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,980
enterprise pathologizes,
the good people leave,

313
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,280
the people who have other things that 
they could do,

314
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,720
they leave first knows are the most 
productive and talented people.

315
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,793
As soon as the most productive leave,
then the bloody thing just spirals 

316
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,430
downhill.
Because what,

317
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,440
what's going to happen?
You've,

318
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,770
you've,
you know,

319
00:16:02,771 --> 00:16:06,130
because the rule is,
is that within a certain discipline,

320
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:06,964
whatever it happens to be,
the square root of the number of people 

321
00:16:09,581 --> 00:16:11,800
in the discipline produce half the 
productive work.

322
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,170
So if the university has,
let's say a thousand professors,

323
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,603
um,
30 of them produce half the 

324
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,090
publications,
right?

325
00:16:22,091 --> 00:16:23,170
Which is staggering,
right?

326
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:24,004
It's staggering.
That's the pareto distribution or 

327
00:16:26,471 --> 00:16:27,304
price's law.

328
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,503
And so,
and those people are often have more 

329
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:33,830
opportunities than they know what to do 
with.

330
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,410
And so as soon as whatever they're doing
becomes unstable,

331
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:39,770
it's like they go off and do other 
things and then the,

332
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,920
then the institution loses its most 
productive people.

333
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,380
And that's it.
It's done.

334
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,900
It can't recover from that.
And so,

335
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:52,190
and the introduction of these so-called 
science,

336
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,103
uh,
disciplines that we call studies 

337
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:57,350
disciplines.
You know,

338
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,663
it was a market lowering of standards.
It involved in market lowering of 

339
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:03,164
academic standards,
a blurring of what actually constituted 

340
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:06,970
discipline,
um,

341
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,743
refusal whatsoever to consider anything 
methodologically rigorous because 

342
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:13,394
anything goes including author,
what do they call that auth no auto 

343
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,343
ethnography,
which is where you just write a diary 

344
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:22,690
essentially about your own experiences.
Next,

345
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,563
got this fancy name.
So auto ethnography as part of gender 

346
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:26,990
science,
you know,

347
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:32,230
it's positively or Wellington and
it's,

348
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:33,963
and the other thing that's interesting 
about that is that what's happened is 

349
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:38,074
that the people who have these radical 
viewpoints have been given a permanent 

350
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:42,460
sign.

351
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,293
It cure right there,
there their state and tuition sponsored 

352
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,633
activists who spend every single moment 
of their time on what I would consider 

353
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,124
their fifth column agenda.
So we're basically funding a cohort of 

354
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:03,260
people who stated purpose is to demolish
the patriarchy.

355
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,240
Um,
you know,

356
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,133
one of the things Carl Young said,
which I really liked and haven't talked 

357
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:09,554
about that much,
is that the unconscious representation 

358
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:13,304
of men in the female psyche,
he called the animus and the animus was 

359
00:18:18,381 --> 00:18:22,040
always in his estimation because of the 
dream analysis he did and so forth.

360
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,203
That although the unconscious 
representation of a woman in a man's 

361
00:18:26,181 --> 00:18:27,014
psyche was an individual woman,
the unconscious representation of the 

362
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:34,490
male psyche in the female unconscious 
was men as a group.

363
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,013
And there's a very large number of women
and and also some men whose conception 

364
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:42,294
of male yes is,
has been damaged very badly by their 

365
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:51,840
failure to establish any positive 
relationship with any male whatsoever in

366
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:52,674
their developmental history.
And then they project this paranoid 

367
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:56,514
representation of what constitutes 
hierarchical masculinity onto the world 

368
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,530
and then fight too,
bring it down.

369
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,763
And it's,
and the thing is they're being 

370
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,390
successful.
That's the problem is this is,

371
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,100
this is it,
this is another one when I was actually,

372
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,530
I know that you are very popular with 
the,

373
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,543
a lot of young men,
but I was actually introduced to you by 

374
00:19:20,691 --> 00:19:23,490
a,
a mother or two professor in,

375
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,620
uh,
in education.

376
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,600
So she's really,
she's not in her,

377
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,411
uh,
at the,

378
00:19:29,411 --> 00:19:30,700
at home,
so to speak,

379
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:33,740
ideologically or a,
but uh,

380
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,420
okay.

381
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,050
One thing that's worrying me is

382
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,260
the,
okay,

383
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,893
there are certain,
certain parts of a certain ideologies 

384
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:49,160
that take on a religious overtones 
though.

385
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,690
And I think that feminism has some of 
those characteristics.

386
00:19:53,691 --> 00:19:54,690
I mean,
in Christian,

387
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,370
they were all born sinful or we need to 
come to grips with our sinfulness.

388
00:19:58,371 --> 00:19:59,204
And in the end,
only God's grace and forgiveness can 

389
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:01,880
redeem us.
And,

390
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,211
uh,
in,

391
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:05,430
in Lutheranism at least a,
it's,

392
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:06,690
uh,
we don't can,

393
00:20:06,691 --> 00:20:08,970
we can be forgiven by priests.
It's only dog.

394
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,110
Yeah.
Doctrine.

395
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:11,983
There's no escape.

396
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:17,300
Rob and I totally sympathize with it,
even though I don't in a lot of ways,

397
00:20:18,511 --> 00:20:19,890
but um,
I realized,

398
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,513
uh,
but within feminist and the sin is 

399
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:25,110
situated within males instead,

400
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,160
well,
no,

401
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,640
not only with within nails,
but within males as a collective,

402
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,103
which has even see that's the thing 
about the Christian doctrine that you 

403
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:33,954
referred to,
is that it makes each individual 

404
00:20:35,731 --> 00:20:39,660
responsible for their own darkness.
Now the Catholics say,

405
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:40,494
look,
that's unbearable and people need to 

406
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:44,790
have the slate wiped clean.
Now in that and confessional do that,

407
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:48,750
and there's an intermediary and you 
considered that merciful.

408
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,490
And there's some real power in that 
argument.

409
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:53,110
You know,
that the cynical argument is,

410
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:55,870
well,
you can just wipe the slate clean at any

411
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:58,030
time and you don't have to bear any 
responsibility.

412
00:20:58,031 --> 00:21:01,360
But I think that's cynical.
The Protestants put themselves in a much

413
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:03,310
tougher position because there's no 
escape.

414
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,340
And,
but the upside of all of that is,

415
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:09,280
is that the darkness is to be regarded 
as within,

416
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,220
not without.
Yeah.

417
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,440
And as soon as you move away from that,
then well,

418
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:14,980
you're,
you're,

419
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,813
you're the good person.
And so is everyone that thinks like you 

420
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:21,430
and all the evil is wherever you want to
put it.

421
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,930
And then as soon as the thing that's 
really dangerous about that,

422
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:30,210
especially if the evil is conceptualized
as contemptible and,

423
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,310
and parasitic and,
and using disgust related language,

424
00:21:34,311 --> 00:21:35,144
for example,
instead of fear related language than 

425
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:42,131
the logical directive is to purify it.
Boy,

426
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,140
that's,
that's not good.

427
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,670
And this is something that I think is 
happening.

428
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,710
Uh,
if I read some,

429
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:57,380
a dissertation about how male feminists 
I think about themselves and how they go

430
00:21:57,381 --> 00:21:59,030
about having sex,
for example,

431
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,373
every one of the men said that he's,
he's way to a approach sex was that he 

432
00:22:04,131 --> 00:22:06,290
didn't take any initiative because he 
would,

433
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,350
he would foul,
uh,

434
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,650
the,
the file,

435
00:22:09,651 --> 00:22:12,200
the,
the whole situation and the woman.

436
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:12,851
Yeah.
Well,

437
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:16,240
it's like Andrea to work in a back in 
the 70s that horrible.

438
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,900
She's a horrible creature,
Andrea to work.

439
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,910
And uh,
you know,

440
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,920
she said that men engaged in sexual 
behavior with an erect penis,

441
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:27,910
that that was,
uh,

442
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,220
that,
that was equivalent to violence.

443
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,630
Right?
That was equivalent to rape.

444
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,070
So,
I mean,

445
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:35,983
I don't even know what to say about that
except that that's exactly what Andrea 

446
00:22:39,921 --> 00:22:40,754
to work and was like.
And she was a real heroine to the 

447
00:22:42,471 --> 00:22:44,090
radical feminists,
you know her.

448
00:22:44,091 --> 00:22:46,570
And there was someone else around that 
period of time.

449
00:22:46,571 --> 00:22:47,404
Andrew Catharine Mackinnon,
I think her name was equally equally 

450
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,290
well.

451
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,290
I think I read a book.

452
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,320
Oh yeah.
Well you,

453
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,740
you would've,
you would've,

454
00:22:58,741 --> 00:22:59,221
yeah.
Yeah.

455
00:22:59,221 --> 00:22:59,760
I mean,
from,

456
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,870
from my perspective as a clinician,
those people have clear every indication

457
00:23:03,871 --> 00:23:07,770
of serious personality disorders.
And I actually think to some degree that

458
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:13,160
we've made a haven for people who have 
serious personality pathology in these,

459
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,830
in these pseudo disciplines,
in the universities.

460
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:19,630
And you know,
you said something interesting,

461
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:20,464
you said that,
uh,

462
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,330
you know,
when you went to,

463
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,880
to,
when you took your sociology degree that

464
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:25,714
these were basically fringe views.
Now there's center views in the 

465
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:28,534
university,
but also implying that they're 

466
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,023
increasingly dominant views in society.
And that's the thing is that people 

467
00:23:35,111 --> 00:23:37,810
think that these are somehow ivory tower
arguments.

468
00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:38,644
But what happens in the university's 
happens in society five to 10 years 

469
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,030
later.
And so,

470
00:23:43,031 --> 00:23:44,890
and that's exactly what's happening 
right now.

471
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,303
So

472
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,590
one,
I think this,

473
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:54,790
this leads us into the me to a debate 
with them because all you have people in

474
00:23:56,211 --> 00:23:57,044
Sweden right now,
I think the me too phenomenon is much 

475
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:03,530
larger in Sweden than in any other 
country.

476
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,393
I mean it's,
it's dominated the media for one month 

477
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:08,071
now.
And,

478
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:11,580
uh,
every profession has,

479
00:24:11,581 --> 00:24:12,510
uh,
uh,

480
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,620
uh,
collect has an a me too,

481
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:20,190
uh,
sort of article with thousands of women,

482
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,080
uh,
signing on to it.

483
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,300
So the teachers and the lawyers and the 
doctors.

484
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:28,530
So,
but one,

485
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,890
one thing is interesting about this is 
how the men are,

486
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,930
are handling it because um,
there are a lot of men writing that I as

487
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:41,330
a man,
uh,

488
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,470
have a responsibility for this 
happening.

489
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,270
I as a man,
as a male,

490
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,460
I'm responsible and I'm guilty.
And actually it was one.

491
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,410
So there are a lot of articles like 
that.

492
00:24:52,411 --> 00:24:55,200
And then one of them,
one of the men that was accused of doing

493
00:24:55,201 --> 00:24:58,560
something inappropriate,
it was the former,

494
00:24:59,100 --> 00:24:59,933
the for the left Radical Party.
And if the thing he had done was not so 

495
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:06,114
reprehensible approached the woman and 
then she had said no and he had 

496
00:25:10,441 --> 00:25:13,560
apologized,
but then she didn't accept that the now,

497
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,423
now he's under investigation police 
investigation and we have this sort of 

498
00:25:18,511 --> 00:25:19,344
witch hunt

499
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:22,723
that almost all all manifestations of 
male sexuality are going to be brought 

500
00:25:27,621 --> 00:25:28,610
under legal control.

501
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,980
And he actually wrote an article that 
said,

502
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,933
yes,
I am responsible because I say I'm 

503
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,453
responsible.
I'm better than the majority of men's 

504
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:38,904
reactions to this.
So actually he turned the thing that he 

505
00:25:40,771 --> 00:25:41,604
was being under investigation into 
because he showed that because he 

506
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,920
admitted he showed that he was better.

507
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,060
Yeah.
So,

508
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,300
so
it's very our stay,

509
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:52,134
I mean the whole idea was that you were 
supposed to come to terms with your 

510
00:25:54,631 --> 00:25:55,464
class guilt and then confess and then,
and then indicate that you could be 

511
00:25:59,371 --> 00:26:01,710
brought back into the ideological fold 
properly.

512
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,780
The thing is,
it's a lot of muddy thinking.

513
00:26:03,781 --> 00:26:04,614
It's like,
well man should take responsibility for 

514
00:26:06,151 --> 00:26:09,810
their aggressive sexuality and they 
should incorporate it.

515
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,490
Right?
Because if you repress it,

516
00:26:11,491 --> 00:26:13,980
it just comes out in the most ugly way.
So,

517
00:26:13,981 --> 00:26:16,290
I mean,
part of the ideas that men,

518
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,720
boys should be socialized like little 
girls,

519
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,880
you know?
But that's complete rubbish.

520
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:21,803
In fact,
even little girls perhaps shouldn't be 

521
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,110
socialized like little curls,
but whatever.

522
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,973
I mean that's beside the point that that
aggressive capacity that's associated 

523
00:26:30,301 --> 00:26:33,510
with sexuality as well as Freud pointed 
out so long ago,

524
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,230
needs to be integrated within the 
personality so that it's under control,

525
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:37,620
right?

526
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,453
And then it's,
it's the hint of darkness and it's the 

527
00:26:40,321 --> 00:26:42,270
capacity for malevolence,
but it's,

528
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,333
but it's brought,
but it's brought under civilized 

529
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,703
regulation.
And so then you get to have your cake 

530
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:49,381
and eat it too.
Right?

531
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:50,214
You can be strong and potentially 
dangerous and mysterious and all of 

532
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:55,680
those things that are definitely 
attractive.

533
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:59,430
That's an attractive features of men,
not only to women,

534
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:01,420
but also to other men.
Um,

535
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,230
so you have to take responsibility for 
that.

536
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,093
But that doesn't mean that you should 
identify yourself as the member of a 

537
00:27:07,801 --> 00:27:10,920
guilty group because of a class based 
accusation.

538
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,300
Right.
That's just,

539
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,930
you're not guilty as the member of a 
class.

540
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,240
I mean,
that's part of the reason that I've been

541
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:19,074
pushing so hard against these postmodern
neo Marxist ideas because one of their 

542
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:27,450
essential predicates is that you can be 
guilty as the member of a class.

543
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:31,180
And that is,
I don't know if there's a more dangerous

544
00:27:31,181 --> 00:27:34,390
idea then then that there might be,
because you know,

545
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,330
there's a very large number of extremely
dangerous ideas,

546
00:27:38,331 --> 00:27:41,000
but that one's,
that one's up near the top.

547
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,510
It's happening to great degree in the 
United States to lesser so in Canada,

548
00:27:47,511 --> 00:27:50,720
but every day there's another,
you know,

549
00:27:50,721 --> 00:27:51,554
slew of,
of influential man who are being outed 

550
00:27:56,511 --> 00:27:59,840
for their past sexual misbehavior and 
you know,

551
00:27:59,841 --> 00:28:00,710
and that,
and,

552
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:03,200
and that's,
that's uh,

553
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,333
I don't have much to say about that 
except that to use that as evidence for 

554
00:28:07,251 --> 00:28:12,020
the
group based guilt of men as such.

555
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,283
Yeah.
Well,

556
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,220
whatever,
whatever,

557
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,190
it's going to get a hell of a lot worse 
before it gets better,

558
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:21,024
I'm afraid.

559
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,163
I think this is also,
I would like to ask you about this as 

560
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:27,950
well,
because as a,

561
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,020
as a man growing up in a,
in a country like Sweden,

562
00:28:31,021 --> 00:28:34,780
you have to,
I wouldn't say that.

563
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,123
I think a lot of boys at least,
or are confused what it means to be a 

564
00:28:39,911 --> 00:28:40,450
man.
And,

565
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,283
and then you have these public figures,
adult males admitting to collective 

566
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:51,210
guilt and trying to be sort of the new 
new mail,

567
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,470
which admits to guilt the feminist,
the good man,

568
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,673
um,

569
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,950
tom of a man resting on top of the warm 
TV.

570
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:03,080
Who's,
who's,

571
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,700
who's,
what would you say moral virtue consists

572
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:10,390
in his harmlessness exactly.
What,

573
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,583
what's,

574
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,630
I mean how,
what's the advice to give to,

575
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,493
because what I find,
I see a lot of men trying to find their 

576
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:22,450
way in,
find out what it means to be a man.

577
00:29:22,451 --> 00:29:27,420
And I think that's a lot of them turns 
to you and a,

578
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:31,240
or a person like Jocko willink and let,
let interviewed you.

579
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,840
And because you are,
you're,

580
00:29:32,841 --> 00:29:35,680
uh,
and why do you think that it's,

581
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,083
I mean,
is it the because it doesn't seem so 

582
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,360
you're sugarcoating

583
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,653
life,
you're not giving them the funny thing 

584
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:46,481
about,
well,

585
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:47,314
there's a couple of things that are 
doing that are different from what 

586
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:50,230
people usually do.
You know,

587
00:29:50,231 --> 00:29:51,064
so in the last 20 years,
the constant message to young people is 

588
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,220
self esteem,
self esteem,

589
00:29:57,221 --> 00:29:58,870
feel good about yourself.
It's like,

590
00:29:58,871 --> 00:30:01,780
I don't buy that.
I think that you look at yourself in the

591
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:03,340
mirror and you think,
Jesus Christ,

592
00:30:03,341 --> 00:30:05,110
I could be a hell of a lot better than I
am.

593
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,330
And so,
and the thing is,

594
00:30:07,331 --> 00:30:10,870
there's nothing more complimentary to 
tell a young person than that.

595
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,880
It's like,
look at you.

596
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:15,970
You're a wreck.
Grow the hell up.

597
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,220
There's so much more to you than your 
manifesting.

598
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:19,930
Then you can hardly imagine it.
It's like,

599
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,760
what you think?
That's a criticism.

600
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:22,810
It's like,
no,

601
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:24,550
it's not.
It's a great compliment.

602
00:30:24,551 --> 00:30:25,384
It's like,
look at how much more you could bring 

603
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:31,240
out into the world.
Get your aggression under control,

604
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,540
strengthen yourself.
Like take on some responsibility.

605
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,360
See if you have enough bloody courage to
tell the truth.

606
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,750
Put your life together,
stop whining.

607
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,633
The man,
eat that up because no one's ever told 

608
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:47,470
them that.
Which just makes breaks my heart.

609
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,700
It's so bad.
And you know,

610
00:30:51,701 --> 00:30:54,790
the boys are pulling out of everything.
They're pulling out a university,

611
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:58,120
they're pulling out of life,
they're pulling out of marriage,

612
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,850
and,
and because of that,

613
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:01,684
they're more awkward and unsophisticated
than they would otherwise be in much 

614
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:08,260
more prone to make sexual errors,
some of which are,

615
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,123
you know,
predatory malevolence in a small 

616
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:12,994
proportion of cases.
But it's another one of those 

617
00:31:14,411 --> 00:31:15,250
situations,
you know,

618
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:18,610
like imagine that one in a hundred men 
are sexual predators.

619
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,793
Probably.
Maybe it's one in 50 but let's go with 

620
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:23,950
one in a hundred.
Well,

621
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,260
they,
that small proportion commit all of this

622
00:31:29,261 --> 00:31:32,350
sexual predation.
Like if you look at criminals,

623
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,120
it's the parade.
Oh,

624
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:34,954
distribution again,
5% of the criminals produce something 

625
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:40,420
like,
well,

626
00:31:40,421 --> 00:31:43,120
the overwhelming majority of the crimes,
right?

627
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:43,954
It's a small coterie of specialized 
people who are responsible for all the 

628
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:48,244
criminality.

629
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:51,520
Lots of people are in prison because 
they did one highness thing.

630
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:52,354
You know,
like they got enraged or drunk and did 

631
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:55,684
something violent.
But there's the serial criminal types 

632
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,520
and they're the ones that are,
they do all,

633
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,393
they,
they like we had one guy in Toronto for 

634
00:32:03,341 --> 00:32:04,174
example,
who ran a bike theft ring and they 

635
00:32:05,921 --> 00:32:06,754
finally nailed him.
And like there weren't any bikes stolen 

636
00:32:10,151 --> 00:32:10,984
in Toronto after that.
It was just him and his little coterie 

637
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:14,680
of,
you know,

638
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,730
organized bike thieves and these guys 
that are being outed,

639
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,320
the serial predators,
they are responsible like one,

640
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:27,640
one spread predatory guy can prey on who
knows,

641
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:30,830
500 females,
thousand females into lifetime,

642
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,350
you know.
So

643
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,770
it's a little,
seems like everyone listens.

644
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,190
A lot of guys,
I

645
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,760
was one of these guys who sort of turned
away from society for,

646
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,540
for awhile,
like into computer games,

647
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:51,950
like this slacker identity where,
which is sort of,

648
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,580
I guess it's always been there.
Like you turn to a,

649
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:00,540
like a way from all responsibilities and
you got reimbursed.

650
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,810
But the opportunities to do this,
it's so much Florida now,

651
00:33:04,811 --> 00:33:05,020
right?

652
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,590
Yeah.
Well it's,

653
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,470
it's the lost boys like in Peter Pan 
Right there.

654
00:33:08,471 --> 00:33:10,630
It never land.
And they never grow up.

655
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,930
And Peter Pan is their leader.
That's,

656
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,823
that's the story.
And it's not surprising because it's 

657
00:33:17,411 --> 00:33:20,820
easier to do.
It's easier to occupy yourself trivially

658
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,673
than it is to do something difficult.
So like there's a big tendency in that 

659
00:33:25,241 --> 00:33:26,074
direction to begin with because it's 
easier to do nothing than to take 

660
00:33:28,691 --> 00:33:29,524
responsibility.
It's easier to play games than to plan 

661
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:32,884
for the future.
It's easier to be resentful and angry 

662
00:33:35,831 --> 00:33:38,130
than it is to be,
you know,

663
00:33:38,131 --> 00:33:40,140
to shoulder you're vulnerability 
properly.

664
00:33:40,141 --> 00:33:40,974
And then when you add on to that,
the idea that if you go out into the 

665
00:33:44,701 --> 00:33:49,020
world and try to strive forward,
that you're nothing but a predatory

666
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:53,830
patriarch,
then well,

667
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,040
it's just one more.
It's just the icing on the cake.

668
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,173
You know,
I had a friend who was like that he 

669
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,060
pulled back from the world.

670
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,593
Um,
and because he believed that active 

671
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,260
masculinity was a pathological force 
and,

672
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,543
um,
he poisoned himself terribly because of 

673
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:13,610
that.
And he committed suicide.

674
00:34:13,611 --> 00:34:14,444
When he was 40,
he hooked an exhaust Noah hose onto his 

675
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:21,050
exhaust pipe and gassed himself up in 
the mountains in Alberta.

676
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:25,970
And that was the logical consequence of 
his self hatred.

677
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,440
It's like,
well,

678
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:30,650
if you're so pathological,
why don't you just do it yourself in and

679
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,570
hiding like that is it?
You know,

680
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,404
it's not,
that's obviously not the full fledged 

681
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,500
manifestation of that,
but,

682
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:38,840
but it's,
it's,

683
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,770
believe me,
it's on the road.

684
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,300
So,
and so.

685
00:34:42,301 --> 00:34:43,134
Yeah.
I've been talking to all these young 

686
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:45,720
guys,
they come to my biblical lectures,

687
00:34:45,721 --> 00:34:47,910
for example,
and the message is always the same.

688
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:49,710
It's like,
stand the hell up.

689
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,290
Get the hell out there in the world.
Take local responsibility.

690
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:59,600
Put yourself together because there's 
nothing more dangerous than a weak man.

691
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,690
And the problem is,
is that we're encouraging men to be weak

692
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,553
because we have this pathological idea 
that there's that strength and tyranny 

693
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,274
or the same thing.
And that's that Animus I was talking 

694
00:35:12,591 --> 00:35:15,470
about earlier though,
women start only women,

695
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,870
but the feminist types,
let's say,

696
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,123
who insist upon the pathology of the 
Patriarchy cannot distinguish between 

697
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:24,134
competence and power.
They see everything because they have 

698
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:32,990
this vague and undifferentiated sense of
masculinity.

699
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,123
They say they see everything that is 
associated with authority as equivalent 

700
00:35:39,211 --> 00:35:40,044
to tyranny.
Failing to understand completely that 

701
00:35:42,091 --> 00:35:45,750
authority in a properly function society
is based on competence.

702
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,210
They don't believe in competence 
anyways.

703
00:35:48,211 --> 00:35:50,220
You know,
that's part of the whole postmodern.

704
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,660
Yeah.
That's just the cost or to keep power.

705
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:54,491
Yeah,
exactly.

706
00:35:54,491 --> 00:35:55,324
What everything's about.
Power for the bloody postmodernists and 

707
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,830
that also excuses their use of power.

708
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,430
And this is a,
I mean,

709
00:36:03,431 --> 00:36:05,210
in Sweden,
we have a,

710
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,140
girls have always outperform boys in 
school.

711
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:12,490
Ever since we started having schools in 
the 19th century,

712
00:36:12,491 --> 00:36:13,324
in the middle of 19th century,
girls have been outperforming boys and 

713
00:36:15,551 --> 00:36:18,340
being better at sitting quietly in a 
classroom.

714
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,833
But the last 2030 years,
the divide between rural girls and boys 

715
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:24,934
is widening.
In Sweden it's a widening in other 

716
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:28,210
countries too.
But in Sweden,

717
00:36:28,211 --> 00:36:29,070
it's really,

718
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,870
really you guys,
you guys are ahead of the curve.

719
00:36:31,871 --> 00:36:33,550
So congratulations on that.

720
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,510
Proud about this.
I'm not so proud about that.

721
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,680
But uh,
so,

722
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,423
eh,

723
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,470
actually why don't you talk to people in
Sweden,

724
00:36:43,471 --> 00:36:44,304
they're more worried about bringing up 
boys then bringing up girls nowadays 

725
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,073
because girls,
they can be girls or they can be like 

726
00:36:51,881 --> 00:36:52,290
boys.

727
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,123
Yeah,
exactly.

728
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,560
The boys.
Boys,

729
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,330
boys.
Yeah,

730
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:01,230
exactly.
Yup.

731
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:05,690
Boys should perhaps be like more like 
girls,

732
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:09,080
but they should most definitely,
it may not be like boys,

733
00:37:09,081 --> 00:37:11,570
they should not play war.
They should not compete so much.

734
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,420
Well the competition thing is really 
interesting because yeah,

735
00:37:14,421 --> 00:37:17,450
the people who are,
who are hyper cooperative,

736
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,670
no regard competition as a positive evil
without understanding,

737
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,060
without,
they have no understanding whatsoever of

738
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:25,920
developmental psychology.
You know,

739
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:29,100
one of the things I really liked Sean 
Piaget and you know,

740
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:29,963
one of the most intelligent things he 
ever said about children's games 

741
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:33,893
competitive games was that the 
competition is nested inside a higher 

742
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:40,380
order structure of cooperation.
So you think about a hockey game,

743
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:44,660
we can talk about that cause we're 
Swedes and Canadians don't you say,

744
00:37:44,661 --> 00:37:48,350
well are the hockey players competing,
are cooperating?

745
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,840
And the answer is what you have to do 
with micro analysis.

746
00:37:50,841 --> 00:37:51,674
So fundamentally they're cooperating 
because they all agreed to abide by the 

747
00:37:55,471 --> 00:37:56,304
same set of rules.
So they occupied the same perceptual 

748
00:37:59,111 --> 00:37:59,944
space.
They occupied the same value space 

749
00:38:02,231 --> 00:38:04,570
because the value is score goals and win
the game.

750
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:09,250
So that provides the overarching frame.
So fundamentally they're cooperating now

751
00:38:09,251 --> 00:38:10,084
within that,
they're competing because it's team 

752
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:14,710
against team.
And even within a team,

753
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:17,330
it's individuals vying for,
uh,

754
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,520
let's say athletic supremacy.
But it's also more complicated than that

755
00:38:22,661 --> 00:38:27,661
because a hockey isn't one game.
It's a sequence of iterated games.

756
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:32,780
And the proper strategy is if you're an 
individual athlete,

757
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,600
is to adopt a strategy that makes you a 
victor across iterated games.

758
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,470
And that means you have to cooperate 
with your teammates.

759
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,060
And even with the,
with the other team,

760
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:46,480
if you're going to sustain your career 
across time,

761
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,220
you know,
so you get honorable,

762
00:38:48,221 --> 00:38:50,800
very honorable hockey players,
say like Wayne Gretzky,

763
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:55,360
who were unbelievably stellar in their 
individual performance,

764
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:59,800
but also great team players and 
inspirations to those who played against

765
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:01,150
them.
Perfect.

766
00:39:01,151 --> 00:39:01,901
You know,
so,

767
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:02,734
so that's a really good example of well 
developed masculinity and that's all 

768
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,753
shunted off into pathological 
competition by fools who are motivated 

769
00:39:12,251 --> 00:39:13,084
by hatred and resentment and who are 
willfully blind to the complexities of 

770
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:20,640
the situation.
So it's the rise.

771
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:23,150
It really is the rise of the,
like of the,

772
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,610
of the,
the goddess of the underworld.

773
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:26,261
It's,
it's,

774
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:27,740
it's the right way to think about it.

775
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:29,910
Uh,
and,

776
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,170
um,
I mean,

777
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,093
this is also a,
I would like to move on to discussing 

778
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,180
and God a little bit,
but,

779
00:39:37,181 --> 00:39:38,710
uh,
this is so interesting.

780
00:39:38,711 --> 00:39:41,170
So I would just say one more as one more
thing because I,

781
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,140
if you,
uh,

782
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,820
if you talk to these people about how 
you can reconstruct homosexuals,

783
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,370
I mean,
can you say,

784
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,580
can you send them to a straight camp?
I mean,

785
00:39:50,581 --> 00:39:52,140
all of them would say that's horrible.

786
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:53,160
Okay.

787
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,993
But if you ask about how can you 
deconstruct and then reconstruct boys 

788
00:39:57,451 --> 00:40:00,440
and their masculinity,
all of them are a board.

789
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:05,590
So part of the,
yeah.

790
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,753
So,
so it's,

791
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,960
it's a very inconsistent,
well,

792
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,933
I mean,
one of the things I complained about 

793
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,670
last year with regards to this bill cc 
Stu [inaudible] legislation in Canada,

794
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:17,940
as I said,
look,

795
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:23,230
you're instantiating a social 
constructionist view of gender,

796
00:40:23,231 --> 00:40:25,960
gender expression,
sexual proclivity,

797
00:40:25,961 --> 00:40:27,760
all of these things into the law.
Okay.

798
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:30,200
So it's socially constructed.
Okay.

799
00:40:30,201 --> 00:40:34,170
So wake up.
The Conservatives who have been,

800
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:35,643
uh,
opposing homosexuality for the last 

801
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:42,100
hundred years have used nothing but 
social constructionist arguments.

802
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,930
They basically say,
well,

803
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:47,090
if it's socially constructed or an 
individual choice,

804
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:47,871
which is,
by the way,

805
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:48,704
now it's stantiating into Canadian law,
then why the hell can't you just be 

806
00:40:52,431 --> 00:40:57,100
reeducated out of it or just drop it if 
it's just an individual choice?

807
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:00,290
Well,
I tried to say you're,

808
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,610
you're playing with fire,
the fire that will consume you.

809
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,200
Yeah.
You know,

810
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,020
nobody,
nobody,

811
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,160
no,
I shouldn't say nobody.

812
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,650
These arguments are,
these arguments are subtle and,

813
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:19,140
and they're not easy to follow.
And so,

814
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:20,603
and the problem is,
is that the consequences of producing 

815
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:25,540
legislation like that unfold over 
decades.

816
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:28,290
Not minutes.
So I don't know.

817
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,830
Did you see what happened at Wilfrid 
laurier university in Canada last week,

818
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,420
two weeks ago?
Lindsay Shepherd?

819
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,283
Does that ring a male?
I listen to the conversation she 

820
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:41,350
recorded.
Yeah.

821
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,120
So in Canada now,
three things are happening.

822
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,163
The first is,
despite the fact that I predicted this 

823
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,530
and that the only reason my reputation 
was ever,

824
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,393
let's say tarnished,
was because I predicted that this was 

825
00:41:54,651 --> 00:41:57,920
going to happen.
I'm still being vilified by people who,

826
00:41:57,921 --> 00:41:59,560
even,
who,

827
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,433
who are admitting nonetheless that what 
happened at Wilfrid laurier was 

828
00:42:03,591 --> 00:42:05,060
reprehensible.
Okay.

829
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:09,970
So that's one thing.
The second thing is the people at Lauria

830
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:10,823
who used,
who accused Lindsay of breaking the 

831
00:42:13,221 --> 00:42:14,054
Canadian federal and provincial laws are
being accused of misinterpreting those 

832
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:18,824
laws,
which they aren't as far as I'm 

833
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,940
concerned,
but that enables people to save face.

834
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,793
And third and most dreadfully a fair 
number of faculty members and public 

835
00:42:30,951 --> 00:42:34,910
commentators are claiming that Ramboo 
Kana and Pimlott and Joel,

836
00:42:34,911 --> 00:42:38,000
who were the interlocutors in the 
inquisition,

837
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,350
are the true victims.
Really?

838
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,350
Oh,
absolutely.

839
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,870
Because now,
now that people have been,

840
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:45,591
well,
first of all,

841
00:42:45,591 --> 00:42:49,820
they were only standing up for trans 
rights and second while,

842
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:53,300
because they'd been the target of 
substantial criticism,

843
00:42:53,301 --> 00:42:55,430
let's say,
like overwhelming,

844
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,000
punishing,
brutal criticism,

845
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,653
unending for weeks while they're,
that they're now victims because that's 

846
00:43:05,091 --> 00:43:05,924
just not fair.
And so when the president could Wilfrid 

847
00:43:08,601 --> 00:43:12,710
laurier university apologized to Lindsay
shepherd,

848
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,990
she also said,
but you know,

849
00:43:14,991 --> 00:43:15,824
I also feel,
I also feel that what has happened to 

850
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:19,034
the faculty members in the aftermath of 
this faculty members and administrators 

851
00:43:22,161 --> 00:43:24,140
was also raw.
It's like,

852
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:25,910
it's that typical thing,
you know,

853
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:31,130
you see this when kids get bullied in 
schools now is that the idiot,

854
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:34,160
um,
intervenors and they're,

855
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,173
and they're blind humanitarian impulses 
bring the bully and the victim into the 

856
00:43:40,311 --> 00:43:43,700
principal's office to discuss it,
assuming equal,

857
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,360
equal causal,
what would you call it?

858
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,270
Responsibility on the part of the victim
and the perpetrator.

859
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,320
And they think that,
well,

860
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:54,080
if they just had a nice talk about it,
then,

861
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:56,380
um,
w we could,

862
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:57,223
could be settled,
not understanding at all that the bully 

863
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,493
who's,
let's say one of these one in a hundred 

864
00:44:02,301 --> 00:44:03,134
Predator types,
it's just going to stand on the outside 

865
00:44:05,031 --> 00:44:05,864
of the school ground and wait for the 
victim to come by and just pound the 

866
00:44:09,111 --> 00:44:11,720
hell out of them.
Because that's how bullies work.

867
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:12,231
It's like,
well,

868
00:44:12,231 --> 00:44:14,150
we could settle it like reasonable 
people.

869
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,350
And he's like,
yeah,

870
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,630
right.
You're so God damn naive that,

871
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:18,963
you know,
if evil ever popped out and made a face 

872
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:22,310
at you,
which it likely will,

873
00:44:22,311 --> 00:44:25,370
you'd be scared into post traumatic 
stress disorders so fast,

874
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:28,520
you wouldn't know what hit you.
And I've seen that plenty of times in my

875
00:44:28,521 --> 00:44:30,530
clinical practice.
So,

876
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:32,770
and,
um,

877
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,370
yeah,
these all,

878
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,080
all this Lindsay shepherd that you're,
you're,

879
00:44:38,081 --> 00:44:39,990
uh,
you're now trans folk.

880
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:40,923
I've written about these issues in 
Sweden as one of the few that's 

881
00:44:44,501 --> 00:44:47,760
sweetened about two snot an activist.
And,

882
00:44:47,761 --> 00:44:48,594
uh,
recently I wrote about how it coincides 

883
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:52,314
with the autism diagnosis.
And I think it's the same in the United 

884
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,113
States.
And it's,

885
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,370
I mean,
the number of,

886
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,090
of,
uh,

887
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:05,090
especially young women who's never had 
any doubts about their sexual,

888
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,203
about their gender identity,
but then they found find a likeminded 

889
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:13,470
people with problems connecting socially
on the Internet,

890
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,630
and all of the sudden they decide that 
I'm,

891
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,610
I'm not a woman.
I'm a man.

892
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:18,781
Yeah.
They,

893
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:22,770
most of them have a diagnosis within the
autism spectrum.

894
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:27,420
And to even say this and say that this 
is something we need to investigate

895
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,193
is

896
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:32,880
sort of transphobic because then you're 
uh,

897
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:37,610
you're questioning the motives within 
the person.

898
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:39,980
So you,
you,

899
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,833
you're basically saying that it's not,
maybe it's not an gender identity or 

900
00:45:43,851 --> 00:45:46,910
feeling full kate's company.
Well,

901
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,340
it's like maybe it's going to be worse.

902
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:52,663
Yeah,
well it's going to get worse because 

903
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,100
look like,
here's,

904
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:55,943
here's the logical fallacy.
Not all transsexuals have mental 

905
00:45:59,151 --> 00:45:59,984
illness,
but many people with mental illness are 

906
00:46:03,141 --> 00:46:05,240
going to be confused about their 
identity,

907
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:07,183
right?
So that the pool of people confused 

908
00:46:08,691 --> 00:46:10,850
about their identity is extraordinarily 
large.

909
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,350
Now,
if you produce a social fad,

910
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,530
which is exactly what we're doing with 
gender transformation,

911
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:19,783
then everyone who's unstable is going to
gravitate very rapidly towards that fad 

912
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,840
that's happened many times with 
different forms of pathology.

913
00:46:26,841 --> 00:46:27,674
So for example,
there's a book called the discovery of 

914
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:35,560
the unconscious by an existentialist 
psychotherapist named Henri [inaudible],

915
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,310
which is a great book,
Great Book,

916
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:38,623
and he tracks the cyclical recurrence of
multiple personality disorder over the 

917
00:46:44,461 --> 00:46:45,294
last 300 years.
So a case will be reported after 

918
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,030
everyone forgets about it.
For a generation or two,

919
00:46:51,031 --> 00:46:51,864
a case will be reported and then it 
spreads like wildfire and there's 

920
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,520
multiple personality everywhere.

921
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,833
And then people get skeptical about it 
and the reports dropoff to zero and it 

922
00:47:01,781 --> 00:47:04,660
goes underground again.
And then three generations again,

923
00:47:04,661 --> 00:47:07,930
somebody reports a case history and poof
up it comes again.

924
00:47:07,931 --> 00:47:10,550
And so the,
there,

925
00:47:10,551 --> 00:47:12,910
there are these in Carl Jung wrote about
this a lot.

926
00:47:12,911 --> 00:47:17,590
There are these psychic epidemics that 
occur from time to time.

927
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,290
And uh,
the same thing happened for example,

928
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:21,720
in the 1980s when,
um,

929
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:25,390
there was a huge outcry in the United 
States in particular about,

930
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,520
uh,
satanic ritual abuse daycares and that,

931
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,510
that produced an absolute uproar for 
like five years.

932
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:37,240
And you,
did you have that?

933
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:41,050
Yeah.
One of the professors here and hope solo

934
00:47:41,051 --> 00:47:43,630
at Umsl University,
she wrote a book about,

935
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:48,510
and most of them men of power were in on
it in a hospital.

936
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:50,050
Right,
right,

937
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:50,883
right.

938
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:52,860
Uh,
even though it was,

939
00:47:52,861 --> 00:47:54,620
I mean,
it's blatantly,

940
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:55,280
it's,
it's,

941
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,360
it's crazy.
Yeah.

942
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:01,390
But it was gender scientists call 
because he would criticize.

943
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:04,360
It was sort of a,

944
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:05,280
okay.

945
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:05,960
She,
she,

946
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,793
she,
she's actually one of the architects 

947
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,070
behind our,
uh,

948
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,970
how we view men's violence against 
women.

949
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:15,913
But you also wrote about this satanic 
rituals that men in power had against 

950
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,300
children.
Are they in daycare?

951
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:26,840
It was just like against children 
everywhere.

952
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:27,743
Ah,
AH,

953
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:28,640
yeah.
Yeah.

954
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,473
Well there's a great book written in the
United States called Satan silence by a 

955
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,700
social worker and the lawyer that 
investigated that,

956
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,133
uh,
see tannic ritual abuse epidemic and it 

957
00:48:39,321 --> 00:48:41,690
makes the Salem witch hunts looked like 
nothing.

958
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:42,763
I mean,
the longest prison sentences in history 

959
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:45,374
were handed out for the hypothetical 
perpetrators of these satanic ritual 

960
00:48:48,771 --> 00:48:49,604
abuse.
They dug under whole towns in places 

961
00:48:51,921 --> 00:48:52,754
looking for the tunnels where the,
where the sacrifices were being 

962
00:48:55,731 --> 00:48:56,564
performed.
I mean they invented a whole new 

963
00:48:58,161 --> 00:48:58,994
categories of clinical diagnosis,
late onset female sexual Predator of 

964
00:49:03,261 --> 00:49:04,760
whom there are zero.
Right.

965
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:08,650
That is a category that does not exist.
Unbelievable.

966
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:09,933
It sounds like a great book.
I mean like a great horror horror movie 

967
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:16,870
or something like these satanic circles,
but to actually believe in it,

968
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,460
this is,
it's really crazy.

969
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:20,500
Yeah.
I would like to move on to,

970
00:49:20,501 --> 00:49:21,334
if you have time,
I would like to move on to a question 

971
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:27,380
about the religion because I'm really 
interested in,

972
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,210
in the,
in musth and religion and,

973
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,073
and,

974
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:32,683
okay.

975
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,180
What one thing that's,
um,

976
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:38,790
I mean if,
if you call something a myth,

977
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,720
then it's probably not,
it's not a not alive anymore.

978
00:49:43,721 --> 00:49:44,501
Perhaps.
I mean,

979
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:46,120
if,
if you're actually calling it a myth,

980
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:49,390
if you really believe in it,
you're not believing that it is a myth.

981
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:52,030
And so where we are now,
we've,

982
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:54,330
we've been studying the,
uh,

983
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:59,250
the Bible like scientifically and,
and so we'd reconstruct the,

984
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,133
my first subject in university was 
religious studies and then you 

985
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,473
deconstruct the Bible and you'll learn 
about [inaudible] when everything was 

986
00:50:07,941 --> 00:50:08,940
great and everything.
But,

987
00:50:08,941 --> 00:50:10,770
uh,
what would you do right now?

988
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:13,370
This,
you sort of,

989
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:17,870
you making the Bible in your Bible 
lectures,

990
00:50:17,871 --> 00:50:20,640
you making it accessible for people that
of our,

991
00:50:20,641 --> 00:50:23,730
our age or our,
uh,

992
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:26,190
yeah.
And uh,

993
00:50:26,191 --> 00:50:27,024
and people who would,
I don't think would match or wouldn't 

994
00:50:30,381 --> 00:50:33,000
have naturally turned to the Bible for 
accounts.

995
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,360
You,
I think

996
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:36,673
it's completely,
it's just an indication of how surreal 

997
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:43,710
the current circumstances really are.
I've been selling out the theater that I

998
00:50:43,711 --> 00:50:47,430
booked in Toronto for these biblical 
lectures and it's all full of,

999
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:50,370
it's almost all young men.
Like they're not that young,

1000
00:50:50,371 --> 00:50:52,680
you know,
they're between say 18 and 30,

1001
00:50:52,681 --> 00:50:53,840
something like that.
Although they're,

1002
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,530
you know,
there's women in there and there's older

1003
00:50:55,531 --> 00:50:57,330
people too,
but that's the main audience.

1004
00:50:57,331 --> 00:50:59,220
And it's like,
well that's crazy,

1005
00:50:59,221 --> 00:51:01,140
right?
That's impossible that that's happening.

1006
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,130
But it's an attempt to revive a Phi the 
myth.

1007
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,513
Yeah.

1008
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,420
So what's your,
what's your take take on why?

1009
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:15,450
Why is
I asked,

1010
00:51:15,641 --> 00:51:17,200
uh,
which a Dork is this?

1011
00:51:17,201 --> 00:51:20,230
When I interviewed him,
like there are people there were worried

1012
00:51:20,231 --> 00:51:23,840
about the postmodern challenge to 
everything.

1013
00:51:23,841 --> 00:51:26,070
Like,
like deconstructing everything.

1014
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,620
And so you,
you look for something from in,

1015
00:51:28,621 --> 00:51:29,061
in,
uh,

1016
00:51:29,061 --> 00:51:32,640
in your,
in your life and what I see you doing,

1017
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,690
and I would like you to,
your thoughts on that.

1018
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:40,230
You will bring some,
like from you're trying to bring in sort

1019
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:41,490
of a firmer foothold.

1020
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:43,190
Yes,
exactly.

1021
00:51:43,191 --> 00:51:47,900
That it's like I'm journeying to the 
bottom of the ocean to rescue the father

1022
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:50,290
from the,
from the fire breathing whale.

1023
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,730
That's exactly it.
It's like the thing is,

1024
00:51:52,731 --> 00:51:57,680
is that when everything shakes,
then you look for the foundation.

1025
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:58,860
Right,
right.

1026
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,720
And to me,
the foundation,

1027
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:01,843
the,
the thing the West got right is the 

1028
00:52:03,301 --> 00:52:06,640
divinity of the individual.
That's right.

1029
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,480
It's true.
And it's the myth idea.

1030
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:14,440
This is partly where I had a discussion 
with Sam Harris.

1031
00:52:14,441 --> 00:52:16,150
You know,
that was quite a difficult discussion,

1032
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:18,580
um,
to discussions.

1033
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,370
I wasn't in the best of physical health 
when I had them,

1034
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:23,020
unfortunately,
but that's life.

1035
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:27,250
But you talk when you talk about myths,
you know,

1036
00:52:27,251 --> 00:52:28,084
it sounds like untruth,
but I think about it sort of as Metta 

1037
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:32,043
truth.
It's truer than true in some sense 

1038
00:52:34,181 --> 00:52:35,014
because it consists of abstractions that
have guided human behavior properly for 

1039
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:42,610
forever insofar as human beings have 
been successful.

1040
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:46,810
Um,
and even in so far as we define success,

1041
00:52:46,811 --> 00:52:49,120
it's embedded within these mythological 
ideas,

1042
00:52:49,121 --> 00:52:53,470
which are ideas that we act out,
essentially not ideas that we hold or,

1043
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:56,320
or believe or state their ideas that we 
act out.

1044
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:01,720
And the idea of the divine individual is
at the center of our law,

1045
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:02,860
which is why,
for example,

1046
00:53:02,861 --> 00:53:03,694
even if you're accused of murder,
even if there's overwhelming evidence 

1047
00:53:07,721 --> 00:53:08,554
against you,
you still have value that the state 

1048
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:15,010
cannot nearly trample on.
And that's,

1049
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:15,941
well,
first of all,

1050
00:53:15,941 --> 00:53:18,340
it's unbelievable.
That's the case because you know,

1051
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:22,360
the typical barbaric society,
let's say,

1052
00:53:22,361 --> 00:53:24,760
which is what we're trying to reproduce 
very rapidly,

1053
00:53:24,761 --> 00:53:27,870
is the one that assumes that if you're 
accused of something,

1054
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,900
we might as well just shoot you on the 
off chance that you're guilty.

1055
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:34,860
That's a way easier to,
to adopt that as a principle.

1056
00:53:34,861 --> 00:53:38,800
And it,
and it certainly satiates the Ma,

1057
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:41,950
the blood lust of the mob much more 
effectively.

1058
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:43,543
The idea that we could have constructed 
a worldview that put the pathetic week 

1059
00:53:48,201 --> 00:53:50,330
malevolent,
insufficient,

1060
00:53:50,331 --> 00:53:54,500
vulnerable individual at the center of 
the value structure is just,

1061
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:59,240
it's an accomplishment who's grandier 
cannot possibly be overstated.

1062
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:04,040
And we,
we are the beneficiaries of that system.

1063
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,653
We live within its protective conf 
confines and we're doing everything we 

1064
00:54:08,961 --> 00:54:12,440
possibly can to destroy it as rapidly as
possible.

1065
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:13,933
So,

1066
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:15,653
so if Campbell,
which it was a one of my idols growing 

1067
00:54:21,901 --> 00:54:25,080
up and uh,
I read the hero with a thousand faces,

1068
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,550
isn't too,
is a power of myth lectures.

1069
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:29,720
Uh,
because uh,

1070
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:31,160
I mean as,
as a lot of young men,

1071
00:54:31,161 --> 00:54:35,010
I loved Star Wars and the Lord of the 
rings and then you sort of,

1072
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,280
you read his work and you find out that,
okay,

1073
00:54:37,281 --> 00:54:41,810
so your look is he based his storyline 
or he changed his story,

1074
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:46,811
like fit more into the hero where the 
monument and the,

1075
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:52,370
the Hero's journey story and he said 
that you need,

1076
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:57,490
you need sort of a living myth or Ology 
to be,

1077
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:03,500
to have psychological health and 
spiritual health.

1078
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:07,120
You need to live with him sort of a 
living mythology.

1079
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,370
Yes,
absolutely.

1080
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:09,204
Yeah.
While the mythology tells you who you 

1081
00:55:10,621 --> 00:55:11,860
really are,
yeah.

1082
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,073
Like you know,
you,

1083
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:17,250
you really are a divine son of God.
I mean people,

1084
00:55:17,251 --> 00:55:19,770
people,
people and and you know,

1085
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:20,604
you actually know that because you feel 
guilty about not living up to your 

1086
00:55:22,771 --> 00:55:25,850
potential.
Why in the world would you possibly feel

1087
00:55:25,851 --> 00:55:28,780
that?
But everyone feels that if they have any

1088
00:55:28,781 --> 00:55:29,614
sense at all,
unless they're narcissistic or 

1089
00:55:30,761 --> 00:55:31,594
psychopathic,
everyone feels that burden of the 

1090
00:55:34,121 --> 00:55:34,954
perfection to which they have to 
perfection to which they have not yet 

1091
00:55:37,721 --> 00:55:40,480
aspired nor attained.
And so,

1092
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:41,463
and that's a testament to the,
to the overwhelming potential that 

1093
00:55:44,381 --> 00:55:45,214
characterizes each individual.
And that's really what I'm trying to 

1094
00:55:47,081 --> 00:55:47,914
point out in the biblical lectures.
There's these continual stories about 

1095
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:52,114
the nature of humanity and the nature of
proper being in the face of the tragedy 

1096
00:55:56,291 --> 00:55:57,520
and malevolence of life.

1097
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:02,950
And the Bible is Western.
The Western world's attempt to,

1098
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:06,670
to,
to formulate that as a,

1099
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:11,970
as a comprehensible set of stories and 
also a set of principles for behavior.

1100
00:56:13,001 --> 00:56:15,640
It's,
it's the collective struggle of our,

1101
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:20,820
of our imagination stretched across tens
of thousands of years,

1102
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:24,310
maybe hundreds of thousands of years,
maybe even more than that.

1103
00:56:24,311 --> 00:56:25,960
You know,
cause some of these stories,

1104
00:56:25,961 --> 00:56:28,830
the story,
the story of confronting the malevolence

1105
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,673
serpent,
like I believe that in one form or 

1106
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:34,960
another,
that story is if you also consider it as

1107
00:56:34,961 --> 00:56:35,794
something that could be acted out,
that story is at least 60 million years 

1108
00:56:38,951 --> 00:56:43,320
old.
So because Lynn is veiled,

1109
00:56:43,321 --> 00:56:44,154
is anthropologist at Ucla has 
demonstrated quite nicely that our tree 

1110
00:56:48,841 --> 00:56:53,841
dwelling relatives coevolved with snakes
and our continual battle with snakes and

1111
00:56:53,971 --> 00:56:57,270
predatory reptiles was part of what gave
us our acute vision.

1112
00:56:58,070 --> 00:56:59,390
Cool.
I hate grades.

1113
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,530
Yeah.
Well,

1114
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,053
you know,

1115
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:05,510
uh,
I know,

1116
00:57:05,511 --> 00:57:08,450
I know that I have to ask this because 
this is one of the,

1117
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:12,050
I'm seeing you answered this question,
is that do you believe in God?

1118
00:57:12,051 --> 00:57:12,884
And I saw a youtube video with you when 
you said that you didn't like that 

1119
00:57:16,761 --> 00:57:19,520
question because you were,
you were being boxed in.

1120
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:23,010
And I sort of,
I felt that because one of the things me

1121
00:57:23,011 --> 00:57:27,340
and my wife have been wrestled with is 
we've talked a lot about this.

1122
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:29,423
What do we mean when we say that we 
believe in God because in Sweden to be 

1123
00:57:33,031 --> 00:57:35,430
Swedish,
to be Christian,

1124
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:38,580
it was sort of what it means today to 
say that you are Swedish.

1125
00:57:38,581 --> 00:57:41,970
So if you said that you a Christian,
you were sort of a good family father,

1126
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:43,043
you had a lot of values within that 
being like a good Christian man is 

1127
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:48,423
today.
When you say you're a good Swedish 

1128
00:57:49,711 --> 00:57:50,544
brand,
perhaps,

1129
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:53,940
so it used to mean a lot more,
but then you had the,

1130
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,293
the Evangelical Christians criticizing 
exactly this and saying that you are 

1131
00:58:00,531 --> 00:58:04,310
lost contact with God and then they 
meant it in a much smaller sense

1132
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:10,220
and so they tend to confuse the biblical
stories with lit with empirical history.

1133
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:11,963
Yeah,
and it's not surprising they do that 

1134
00:58:13,321 --> 00:58:15,780
because they're trying to defend their 
faith against,

1135
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:16,853
let's call it the postmodern assault or 
even the modernist assault for that 

1136
00:58:19,561 --> 00:58:20,394
matter.
I have some sympathy with their 

1137
00:58:21,391 --> 00:58:22,224
motivations,
but the problem is is that they don't 

1138
00:58:24,721 --> 00:58:25,554
understand that not all truth is 
empirical truths in in fact the 

1139
00:58:29,671 --> 00:58:30,504
fundamental truths as far as I can tell,
paradoxically enough our Darwinian and 

1140
00:58:34,501 --> 00:58:36,690
they actually line up with religious 
truths,

1141
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:40,200
which is the point that I've been trying
to make when I discussed this.

1142
00:58:40,201 --> 00:58:44,040
Such issues with people like Sam Harris,
like Sam is a very,

1143
00:58:44,041 --> 00:58:46,980
very smart guy,
but he's,

1144
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:50,970
he worships the intellect.
That's the first thing I would say.

1145
00:58:50,971 --> 00:58:55,290
And the second thing is that I was never
able to push him to his solution.

1146
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,220
He'd never let me go there because you 
know,

1147
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:59,063
his idea is that we could rationally 
order society so that the wellbeing of 

1148
00:59:03,061 --> 00:59:04,560
people was maximized.

1149
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,690
And you know,
he even said to,

1150
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:11,390
I think it was,
I can't remember which interview it was,

1151
00:59:11,391 --> 00:59:14,840
but he said explicitly to the person 
that he was interviewing,

1152
00:59:14,841 --> 00:59:18,980
that he could sit down right now and 
come up with a religious system that was

1153
00:59:18,981 --> 00:59:19,814
much more rational,
inappropriate than any the ones that 

1154
00:59:21,561 --> 00:59:24,020
have that have existed to date.
And I think,

1155
00:59:24,021 --> 00:59:24,630
well,
you know,

1156
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:28,370
you're falling right into that 
rationalist Utopian pitfall there.

1157
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:31,130
You're just not that smart.
No one can do that.

1158
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:34,160
And as soon as you do it,
you end up where the socialists,

1159
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:39,200
like the radical Soviet socialists or 
the Nazi utopians ended up,

1160
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,670
we will be speaking as grown.
Combined.

1161
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,593
Yeah.
Wallet.

1162
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:44,860
Yes,
exactly.

1163
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:47,340
Exactly.
The rest of the language than,

1164
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:49,380
than Swedish.
Much more.

1165
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:51,730
Most languages are.
Yeah.

1166
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:52,970
Yeah.
Well that it's,

1167
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,710
it's like,
you know,

1168
00:59:54,711 --> 00:59:55,544
one of the things I really liked about 
Dostoyevsky is that this was a notes 

1169
00:59:58,851 --> 00:59:59,600
from underground.

1170
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,880
He,
he just states it very clearly.

1171
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:02,630
He said,
you know,

1172
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:03,463
the one thing that you cannot claim 
about the history of the world and he 

1173
01:00:05,721 --> 01:00:06,554
meets the history of being is that it's 
rational and it isn't that he's 

1174
01:00:09,861 --> 01:00:13,610
criticizing the idea that you could use 
scientists,

1175
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:14,444
scientific investigation and rationality
to lay out a clear representation of 

1176
01:00:18,621 --> 01:00:21,740
objective reality.
What he's saying is that if you take the

1177
01:00:21,741 --> 01:00:22,574
terrible suffering and malevolence into 
account as fundamental realities that 

1178
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,133
are rationalist perspective is 
absolutely insufficient to tell the 

1179
01:00:30,561 --> 01:00:32,150
story.
And that's,

1180
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,313
there's no doubt about that.
It's just rationality just breaks down 

1181
01:00:36,411 --> 01:00:37,244
in the face of those things.
It hits an obstacle that it cannot 

1182
01:00:40,431 --> 01:00:43,910
contend with.
So you need something else.

1183
01:00:43,911 --> 01:00:44,744
And you know,
there's this great image of Christ as 

1184
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:47,601
Patrick Crater,
very,

1185
01:00:47,601 --> 01:00:48,940
very old image.
Um,

1186
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:52,490
fortunately can't remember which 
cathedral it's represented in,

1187
01:00:52,491 --> 01:00:56,420
but it's a great image and I'm having 
one of them carved for me right now.

1188
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:57,693
It's so,
it's a medieval image of Christ and his 

1189
01:01:00,381 --> 01:01:04,010
face is divided into two halves.
So it's very asymmetrical.

1190
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:05,263
And one half the eyes are different than
the facial expression is different than 

1191
01:01:08,391 --> 01:01:09,350
the other.
And he's also,

1192
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:12,920
he's on portrayed on the top of the Dome
and holding a book.

1193
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,290
So the book is sacred,
right?

1194
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:17,540
So that's a great idea that the book is 
sacred.

1195
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:19,040
That's a great idea,
man.

1196
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:20,293
And the idea that the word is sacred,
but then the picture also represents 

1197
01:01:23,901 --> 01:01:26,840
human beings as creatures with one foot 
in the,

1198
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,273
in the,
in the profane and one foot in the 

1199
01:01:29,991 --> 01:01:32,960
sacred or one foot in the finite and one
foot in the infinite.

1200
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:36,770
And I actually think that that's,
that's empirically true.

1201
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:41,720
Like we are these weird creatures that 
are both finite and infinite at the same

1202
01:01:41,721 --> 01:01:43,880
time.
And we have experiences of that,

1203
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:48,470
even like deep religious experiences,
psychedelic experiences for that matter.

1204
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:49,783
Um,
invoke that feeling of that invoke the 

1205
01:01:53,271 --> 01:01:54,470
reality,
I would say,

1206
01:01:54,471 --> 01:01:58,940
of our connection with the infinite.
Now what that infinite is,

1207
01:01:58,941 --> 01:01:59,774
so let's call that God.
I mean the Christian ideas that that's 

1208
01:02:02,481 --> 01:02:04,730
actually outside of time and space 
itself,

1209
01:02:04,731 --> 01:02:07,880
which is quite a grant,
no ship and not the least bit

1210
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,333
unsophisticated bar the way it's a 
tremendously sophisticated idea that 

1211
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:17,720
something actually exists outside the 
fabric of time and space that transcends

1212
01:02:17,721 --> 01:02:18,554
it,
that they are at the beginning and at 

1213
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:21,444
the end.
That's an unbelievably sophisticated 

1214
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:26,730
idea and I think that people can 
experience that and do quite commonly,

1215
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:31,560
which was why the psychedelic revolution
in the 60s was so absolutely potent.

1216
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,113
So these sorts of things can't just be 
dismissed with some rationalist sleight 

1217
01:02:37,141 --> 01:02:38,490
of hand and,
and,

1218
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:42,210
and some discussion of the idea that 
Christianity Judeo Christianity,

1219
01:02:42,211 --> 01:02:43,044
let's say it's some like primitive set 
of wish fulfillment superstitions or 

1220
01:02:46,801 --> 01:02:47,634
some power game.
It's like you just have no depth of 

1221
01:02:50,401 --> 01:02:53,520
scholarship whatsoever,
if that's what your criticisms are.

1222
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:57,320
And also I would say when,
when uh,

1223
01:02:57,370 --> 01:02:59,710
when you your ass,
when you ask someone,

1224
01:02:59,711 --> 01:03:01,390
do you believe in God?
You.

1225
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:07,160
I ask myself if I say that I don't 
believe in God what within me,

1226
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:09,533
when I say what is different within me 
when I say that I don't believe in God 

1227
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:16,420
compared to a person that says that he 
does believe in God.

1228
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:20,470
I mean is if I feel sort of a 
irrational,

1229
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:21,543
I wake up or I take a glass of wine and 
then suddenly I'm overwhelmed with love 

1230
01:03:25,961 --> 01:03:26,794
for humankind,
for my fellow man or something like 

1231
01:03:28,751 --> 01:03:30,370
that.
So if I,

1232
01:03:30,371 --> 01:03:33,250
if I was a person who will say that I 
believed in God,

1233
01:03:33,251 --> 01:03:34,084
would that be something,
is it something qualitatively different 

1234
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:43,030
between the person,
between me compared to that person?

1235
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:44,433
You understand what I'm [inaudible]

1236
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,350
I haven't quite got that yet.

1237
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:48,053
Like what is the experience of believing
in God and how is that qualitatively 

1238
01:03:52,470 --> 01:03:56,390
qualitatively different from a person 
who says that he doesn't?

1239
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,840
Oh yes.
I see what you mean.

1240
01:03:57,841 --> 01:03:59,550
While that is,
that is part of the question.

1241
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:02,490
The question is here while the,
when someone says,

1242
01:04:02,491 --> 01:04:06,790
do you believe in God?
There's three parts to that question.

1243
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:11,160
The first question is who is the you to 
which they are referring?

1244
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:15,260
And that turns out to not be a simple 
question.

1245
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:18,980
I mean Neesha did a very good job of 
taking apart the idea of the eye,

1246
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:20,173
you know,
cause he was,

1247
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:23,450
he was critiquing descartes' I think 
therefore I am.

1248
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:26,690
And and so the,
the first question is,

1249
01:04:26,691 --> 01:04:28,880
well who is the you to which you are 
referring.

1250
01:04:28,881 --> 01:04:30,950
The second is what do you mean by 
belief?

1251
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:31,784
The third is what do you mean by God?
It's like you can't just leap to the 

1252
01:04:35,421 --> 01:04:36,254
assumption that the person asking the 
question and the person answering the 

1253
01:04:39,201 --> 01:04:43,050
question have the same views on those.
And I think that that's,

1254
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,460
that's part of the reason why I don't 
like the question.

1255
01:04:46,461 --> 01:04:47,360
You know,
like I said,

1256
01:04:47,361 --> 01:04:52,250
well I act as if I believe in God.
And so I would say that's the more,

1257
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:55,400
that's the most fundamental 
manifestation of faith.

1258
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,330
But I could also say I believe and don't
believe in God.

1259
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,920
And you think,
well you can't,

1260
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:04,450
you can't think both of those things at 
the same time.

1261
01:05:04,451 --> 01:05:06,250
It's like,
well yeah,

1262
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,400
that's what you think.
It's,

1263
01:05:08,401 --> 01:05:11,090
it's,
it's in,

1264
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:13,410
when you were asking something that 
complicated,

1265
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,043
then there's absolutely no reason to so 
that you can't have paradoxical 

1266
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:21,770
responses to it.
So you could,

1267
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:22,663
you could even say maybe that the 
injunction in the old testament is 

1268
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:25,754
something like you should believe and 
not believe in God cause it's very 

1269
01:05:29,071 --> 01:05:30,600
complicated.
It's not,

1270
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:34,810
it's not by any means.
A simple a question.

1271
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:37,990
I know,
I don't remember his name though,

1272
01:05:37,991 --> 01:05:41,770
but I think perhaps it was a burger or 
something like that.

1273
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:47,250
He said that myth is about reconciling 
contradictions within the union.

1274
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:49,183
Yeah,
exactly.

1275
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:50,340
That's it.
That's exactly,

1276
01:05:50,341 --> 01:05:51,174
well that's what a successful myth does.
And part of the reason that these 

1277
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,033
etiologies that we'd be discussing,
like feminism have so much power is 

1278
01:05:59,951 --> 01:06:00,784
because they actually draw their motive 
force from an underlying religious 

1279
01:06:04,091 --> 01:06:06,250
substrate.
But they only tell half the story.

1280
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:10,720
That's what an ideology is.
So when the feminists say culture is the

1281
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:12,300
tyrannical patriarch,
it's like,

1282
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,140
yeah,
that's true.

1283
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:18,450
But it's also the benevolent wise king.
So like,

1284
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:22,060
well then they say,
well I can't be one and the other at the

1285
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,410
same time.
And the answer is,

1286
01:06:23,411 --> 01:06:24,244
well,
it's a multidimensional phenomena that 

1287
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:28,330
you're encapsulating within a single 
category.

1288
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:31,150
It can contain contradictions.
In fact,

1289
01:06:31,151 --> 01:06:36,151
it does because society obviously 
constraints and and kills you.

1290
01:06:37,631 --> 01:06:38,464
Even like you dye into your neural 
configuration cause that when you're 

1291
01:06:41,461 --> 01:06:42,294
first born you have more neural 
connections than you will ever in your 

1292
01:06:45,781 --> 01:06:46,614
life.

1293
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:49,310
And most of them die.
And so,

1294
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:50,383
so you dye into your four year old self 
and then between the ages of 16 and 20 

1295
01:06:55,461 --> 01:06:56,294
you dye into your adult self.
And so the idea that that the society 

1296
01:07:00,191 --> 01:07:05,191
that you're in is a terrible tyrant.
The shapes you by death is exactly true.

1297
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,050
But Oh,
by the same token,

1298
01:07:07,051 --> 01:07:11,190
it's also almost everything that 
ennobles you and enables you to function

1299
01:07:11,191 --> 01:07:14,400
in the world.
And so the critic,

1300
01:07:14,401 --> 01:07:16,770
critics of the Patriarchy say tyranny,
tyranny,

1301
01:07:16,771 --> 01:07:17,670
tyranny.
And it's like,

1302
01:07:17,671 --> 01:07:18,151
yeah,
yeah,

1303
01:07:18,151 --> 01:07:21,060
tyranny,
but not only tyranny.

1304
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:24,410
And they say evil man,
evil man.

1305
01:07:24,411 --> 01:07:25,011
It's like,
yeah,

1306
01:07:25,011 --> 01:07:27,620
obviously,
but not only evil men.

1307
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:32,500
Not only that,
and that's why a genuine mythologies,

1308
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:33,493
and I would put Freudian psychoanalysis 
in that category because Freud had a 

1309
01:07:37,621 --> 01:07:39,780
very balanced view of the nature of 
being

1310
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:45,090
talks about both parts of the paradox at
the same time.

1311
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:47,400
You know,
it's the dragon and the gold.

1312
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:50,370
It's the terrible devouring mother and 
the,

1313
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:53,790
and the Virgin Mary.
It's the tyrant and the wise king.

1314
01:07:53,791 --> 01:07:54,624
It's Christ and Satan.
It's all of those paradoxes stacked on 

1315
01:07:58,811 --> 01:07:59,644
top of one another.
And then the story about how you go 

1316
01:08:01,691 --> 01:08:04,570
about dealing with them.
That's a true religious myth.

1317
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:06,613
Yeah.

1318
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:09,260
And an ideology just takes a part of 
that and says,

1319
01:08:09,261 --> 01:08:10,340
this is the whole,

1320
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:12,933
right.
I mean,

1321
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:13,833
in early Christianity,
there was a large battle between many 

1322
01:08:16,221 --> 01:08:17,510
keystrokes and,
uh,

1323
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:18,800
the,
um,

1324
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,680
gnostics and,
uh,

1325
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:22,763
uh,
what would turn out to be the Catholic 

1326
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,500
Church and the,
the mainstream church.

1327
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,690
And they said that the evil evil was 
like the,

1328
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:32,830
the world we live in is created by this 
other force,

1329
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:37,940
the demiurge so that the,
they had a very split vision of,

1330
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:41,330
of,
of good and evil.

1331
01:08:41,331 --> 01:08:42,164
But what you're saying,
what you were saying about these 

1332
01:08:44,931 --> 01:08:45,764
ideologies is that basically it's 
perhaps it's a new formal theological 

1333
01:08:51,051 --> 01:08:55,010
battle between glowsticks and uh,
and people that say that this is,

1334
01:08:55,011 --> 01:08:56,150
we have both sides,

1335
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:57,313
both sides.
That's a perfectly reasonable way of 

1336
01:08:58,971 --> 01:08:59,900
looking at it,
you know,

1337
01:08:59,901 --> 01:09:02,410
and like young tended towards manic.
He as a,

1338
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:05,750
to some degree because he was so struck 
by say the evils of,

1339
01:09:05,751 --> 01:09:06,584
of Nazi-ism and he had a hard time with 
the idea that evil was only the absence 

1340
01:09:12,411 --> 01:09:13,700
of good.
But,

1341
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:16,870
and I've thought about that a lot 
because I'm a great admirer of yoga.

1342
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:19,580
You criticize anything he said at your 
peril,

1343
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:21,380
you know,
because he was a great genius.

1344
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:25,220
But I think that,
I think the Manichaean view is wrong.

1345
01:09:25,221 --> 01:09:29,900
I think that what evil is,
is the absence of good and then it takes

1346
01:09:29,901 --> 01:09:31,700
on its own life.
I think it's,

1347
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:33,003
I mean it's called,
I've written about this in my new book 

1348
01:09:34,601 --> 01:09:35,434
quite extensively because I have a book 
coming out in January called 12 rules 

1349
01:09:38,231 --> 01:09:40,120
for life,
an antidote to chaos.

1350
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,433
And I'd be trying to take those ideas 
apart and to grapple with the well with 

1351
01:09:45,951 --> 01:09:46,784
the fact that human beings hate 
themselves because they're vulnerable 

1352
01:09:49,011 --> 01:09:50,120
and malevolent,
which,

1353
01:09:50,121 --> 01:09:52,030
which is original sin,
you know,

1354
01:09:52,031 --> 01:09:54,370
which is something I'm a great believer 
in.

1355
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:56,330
Um,
okay.

1356
01:09:57,670 --> 01:09:58,503
I think it's an unbelievably 
sophisticated way of looking at the 

1357
01:10:00,371 --> 01:10:00,851
world.
You know,

1358
01:10:00,851 --> 01:10:01,684
that there's something
that there was something damaged in the 

1359
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:08,070
fabric of being itself.
I believe that to be the case.

1360
01:10:08,071 --> 01:10:08,904
I think we experienced that as human 
beings and that our ethical obligation 

1361
01:10:12,961 --> 01:10:17,880
is to rectify that and to determine how 
to rectify that,

1362
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:18,714
to overcome the vulnerability and 
malevolence that like the terror of 

1363
01:10:21,991 --> 01:10:22,824
vulnerability and the subjection to 
malevolence that characterizes our day 

1364
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:26,940
to day existence.
That's our,

1365
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:31,170
that's our primary mode of proper being 
in the world.

1366
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:34,470
That seems to me to be correct.
So,

1367
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,393
and again,
that's the sort of thing that I've been 

1368
01:10:36,271 --> 01:10:37,104
trying to tell.

1369
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:39,830
Well those who will listen,
let's say,

1370
01:10:39,831 --> 01:10:43,220
but it's so far,
it's mostly been young men who are dying

1371
01:10:43,221 --> 01:10:44,510
for this message.
Like they're,

1372
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,040
they're dying for it.
You know,

1373
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:50,220
it's really copies.
I go to these talks now,

1374
01:10:50,221 --> 01:10:51,054
you know,
public talks and where I speak about 

1375
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:58,160
responsibility and truth.
And like after the talks there are like

1376
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:04,090
crowds of mostly young men who line up 
and say,

1377
01:11:04,091 --> 01:11:05,530
you know,
I was nihilistic.

1378
01:11:05,531 --> 01:11:07,390
I was desperate,
I was suicidal,

1379
01:11:07,391 --> 01:11:12,100
I was malevolent and resentful and like 
going bad places.

1380
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:12,934
And I've started to what you've been 
saying about myth and it's like brought 

1381
01:11:17,911 --> 01:11:21,870
me out of that horrible hold.
And that's just one person after another

1382
01:11:21,871 --> 01:11:23,220
says the same thing.
You know,

1383
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:24,054
it's so,
and I've had thousands of letters like 

1384
01:11:26,761 --> 01:11:31,590
that and maybe tens of thousands now,
I can't even begin to keep up with them.

1385
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:34,860
And well,
thank God for that.

1386
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:39,860
You know,
personally or turning to you for,

1387
01:11:40,551 --> 01:11:41,700
uh,
for this,

1388
01:11:41,701 --> 01:11:44,520
uh,
counselor for guidance.

1389
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,020
Well,
you know,

1390
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:46,853
I read this paper along time ago called 
relations between the ego and the 

1391
01:11:49,801 --> 01:11:51,720
unconscious,
which is one of umes.

1392
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,410
Maybe it's his most stellar work.
And,

1393
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:58,950
and it's not a paper you can understand 
unless you know what it's about.

1394
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:02,730
And cause he talked about the danger of 
ego inflation.

1395
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:04,403
That's so,
so imagine that you're dealing with 

1396
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:10,821
archetipal ideas and that you can fall 
prey to the temptation to assume,

1397
01:12:14,221 --> 01:12:15,054
because you started to understand the 
ideas and maybe communicate about them 

1398
01:12:17,881 --> 01:12:22,250
that they are somehow yours.
And then what happens is,

1399
01:12:22,251 --> 01:12:24,600
is that can produce a mess cyanic 
inflation.

1400
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,140
And so that would characterize someone 
like Hitler for example.

1401
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:30,960
Um,
and that's,

1402
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:36,210
it's tantamount to a form of mental 
illness because what happens is that you

1403
01:12:36,211 --> 01:12:37,044
take on the grandeur of the mythological
ideas and the archetypal ideas and the 

1404
01:12:44,371 --> 01:12:47,900
power of those ideas as if they were 
your own creations.

1405
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:51,090
Well,
that's a very bad idea.

1406
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,590
And so I read,
I read those,

1407
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:59,630
that paper after I had a dream where I 
was blown by a wind into the,

1408
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:02,013
the top of a cathedral.
I was in the chandelier in this huge 

1409
01:13:04,801 --> 01:13:05,634
cathedral,
like say 20 times bigger than Saint 

1410
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:11,340
Peter's.
You could hardly even see the walls.

1411
01:13:11,341 --> 01:13:15,870
And I was put up in this at the center 
of this cathedral,

1412
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:16,733
right way above the ground.
And then I got down somehow because I 

1413
01:13:21,031 --> 01:13:24,720
didn't want to be there.
And then the wind dissolve me.

1414
01:13:24,721 --> 01:13:27,090
And blew me back there and I woke up and
I thought,

1415
01:13:27,091 --> 01:13:28,050
oh my God,
that's a,

1416
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:30,300
that's a crazy dream.
Uh,

1417
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:34,860
the dream put me at the center of the 
cross at the center of being,

1418
01:13:34,861 --> 01:13:35,910
and I thought,
what the hell?

1419
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:36,744
That's,
what am I supposed to make of a dream 

1420
01:13:38,221 --> 01:13:39,210
like that?
It's like,

1421
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:42,210
it's,
it's delusional,

1422
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:45,600
let's say orders on delusional.
And it was a very powerful dream.

1423
01:13:45,601 --> 01:13:47,550
Like I can still,
I can still see it.

1424
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:48,413
And I read the relations between the ego
and the unconscious at that time and 

1425
01:13:51,391 --> 01:13:52,224
started to understand what was happening
is that I was starting to understand 

1426
01:13:55,171 --> 01:13:56,004
what these archetypal ideas meant.
That the place of the individual is 

1427
01:13:59,191 --> 01:14:03,180
actually at the crucifix,
at the Center of reality.

1428
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:06,330
The point of maximal suffering and the 
acceptance of that.

1429
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:09,840
That's all true,
but it's not true of me.

1430
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:16,140
Right.
Everybody is a center of the cosmos.

1431
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:17,733
Yeah.
And,

1432
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,633
and,
and so you have to detach yourself as 

1433
01:14:21,071 --> 01:14:21,904
carefully as you can from the archetypal
ideas themselves because otherwise you 

1434
01:14:24,881 --> 01:14:25,714
end up identifying with them personally 
or people identify you with them and 

1435
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:35,300
that that's,
that's the ultimate,

1436
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:39,540
what would you call it,
the ultimate temptation of pride.

1437
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:42,170
And so,
no,

1438
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,350
that's,
so I'm,

1439
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:46,610
I try to be very careful of that.
I'm very cognizant of that and,

1440
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:50,130
and to keep a good eye on my,

1441
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:53,660
yeah,
it's a,

1442
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:55,560
you,
it's like these,

1443
01:14:55,561 --> 01:14:56,430
uh,
you know,

1444
01:14:56,460 --> 01:15:00,660
when the emperors in the Roman Empire,
when they wrote in their trials,

1445
01:15:00,661 --> 01:15:04,290
they had a slave behind them telling 
them a mental moray.

1446
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:05,491
Right.
Exactly.

1447
01:15:05,491 --> 01:15:07,880
Exactly.
Exactly.

1448
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:10,291
I always,
I,

1449
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:14,780
I really liked that idea and I liked the
idea of reminding yourself about,

1450
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:18,080
okay,
death to keep humble,

1451
01:15:18,081 --> 01:15:19,040
keep yourself humble.

1452
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:21,750
It sounds a little

1453
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:23,453
well,
death and sin because the other thing 

1454
01:15:25,981 --> 01:15:28,380
that you have to,
and maybe this is the advantage that the

1455
01:15:28,381 --> 01:15:32,450
Catholics have over the Protestants,
is that the Catholics at least put their

1456
01:15:32,451 --> 01:15:37,220
sins in front of them constantly,
which is very analogous to what you just

1457
01:15:37,221 --> 01:15:38,210
described.
Because it,

1458
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:39,710
and I,
you know,

1459
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:40,543
I try to be very,
very careful about paying attention to 

1460
01:15:45,381 --> 01:15:47,990
all the things that I'm doing wrong.
And I have people,

1461
01:15:47,991 --> 01:15:50,870
my family and friends who are helping me
do that.

1462
01:15:50,871 --> 01:15:51,704
And,
and cause it's a strange to call it a 

1463
01:15:55,231 --> 01:15:59,070
strange situation to be in is just 
barely scraping the surface.

1464
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:00,653
Yeah.

1465
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:02,820
Oh,
I would like to ask you,

1466
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:04,110
uh,
one,

1467
01:16:04,111 --> 01:16:05,580
uh,
at least one more.

1468
01:16:05,581 --> 01:16:05,961
I mean,
I,

1469
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:06,600
I could,
uh,

1470
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:07,433
ask you,
uh,

1471
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:11,340
talk to you for four hours,
but I know you are a busy man.

1472
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,320
Yeah.
I should,

1473
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:14,870
let's do one more question.
We can always talk again.

1474
01:16:14,871 --> 01:16:15,860
You know,
so yeah.

1475
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:18,760
The Church of Sweden,
uh,

1476
01:16:18,761 --> 01:16:22,460
it's our old a state church.
It,

1477
01:16:22,590 --> 01:16:23,423
it's,
it's contemplating replacing the 

1478
01:16:25,441 --> 01:16:26,274
gendered pronouns,
other guide for Church services and 

1479
01:16:28,531 --> 01:16:31,670
they've already starting to replace the 
Lord.

1480
01:16:31,671 --> 01:16:36,290
And he and him with God in a lot of 
places are more inclusive.

1481
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:37,593
Yeah.

1482
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:38,770
And uh,

1483
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:42,123
the people who,
while the people who were running the 

1484
01:16:43,341 --> 01:16:46,790
church have absolutely no idea about 
what any of its doctrines meet.

1485
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:49,070
Yeah.
It's as simple as that.

1486
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:50,143
Like,
I mean there is insistence in 

1487
01:16:51,171 --> 01:16:52,004
Christianity on the Androgyny of Christ 
and there are elements of God that have 

1488
01:16:55,731 --> 01:16:59,000
been portrayed as feminine like Sophia,
which is wisdom,

1489
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:04,530
but you don't mess with those things.
You don't rewrite them like that.

1490
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:09,090
Not Not without having your soul tremble
and quake at your presumption

1491
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:14,940
and the idea that you can just casually 
rewrite these ancient texts.

1492
01:17:14,941 --> 01:17:15,774
It's like these people who rewrite 
fairytales so that they're more in 

1493
01:17:18,761 --> 01:17:19,594
keeping with modern sensibility.
It's like their soul unbelievably 

1494
01:17:24,131 --> 01:17:26,650
intellectually narcissistic,
that while it's,

1495
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:27,603
it's positively say titanic in its,
in its overreach and I mean that in the 

1496
01:17:31,481 --> 01:17:33,460
most technical sense,
it's the,

1497
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:38,690
it's they say titanic temptation of the 
untrammeled and unbound intellect.

1498
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:43,410
It's exactly what Milton warned against 
in paradise lost.

1499
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:45,303
So it's a complete catastrophe.
All it will do is speed the demolition 

1500
01:17:48,491 --> 01:17:50,420
of the church.
So,

1501
01:17:50,421 --> 01:17:54,040
and I think that's what it's aimed at 
actually because of course the church is

1502
01:17:54,041 --> 01:17:54,874
just a patriarchal construct anyways and
it's oppressive and so oppressed women 

1503
01:17:58,271 --> 01:17:59,104
forever,
despite its assistant insistence that 

1504
01:18:00,941 --> 01:18:03,280
men and women were both made in the 
image of God.

1505
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:13,230
Oh,
churches pretty much do when it comes to

1506
01:18:13,231 --> 01:18:14,400
these issues.
It's very,

1507
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:17,350
it's more political than a lot of 
politicians.

1508
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:18,480
Yes.
Well that's it.

1509
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:20,910
It's that when the church becomes 
political,

1510
01:18:20,911 --> 01:18:21,744
it's done.

1511
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:24,700
Yeah.
So I mean,

1512
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:26,530
as I said,
I have a,

1513
01:18:26,531 --> 01:18:28,960
I think I've got the most out of this 
interview.

1514
01:18:28,961 --> 01:18:29,794
It was really,
really informative and really nice 

1515
01:18:33,071 --> 01:18:34,960
talking to you,
talking to you too.

1516
01:18:34,961 --> 01:18:37,270
And you know,
maybe we can do this again in January if

1517
01:18:37,271 --> 01:18:39,610
you want to.
One of the things I could do is send you

1518
01:18:39,611 --> 01:18:41,680
a galley copy of my book if you want it 
to.

1519
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:44,230
Great.
Because I would really like to review it

1520
01:18:44,231 --> 01:18:45,064
and then we could perhaps making the,
I could ask you a couple of followup 

1521
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:50,300
questions to your book or something like
that.

1522
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:51,713
Yeah,
that'd be good because we could get 

1523
01:18:52,381 --> 01:18:54,480
deeper into some of the issues that we 
discussed.

1524
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:56,940
Yeah.
Okay.

1525
01:18:57,470 --> 01:19:01,420
So I'll publish this on Saturday,
this interview,

1526
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:03,970
and I'll send you the recording.
Okay?

1527
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,313
Yeah.
Thank you,

1528
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,060
kate.
That's great.

1529
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:08,610
Thank you.
All right.

1530
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:10,050
You bet on her.
Nice to meet you.

1531
01:19:10,650 --> 01:19:11,790
Nice to meet you.
Bye.

1532
01:19:11,791 --> 01:19:12,624
Bye.
