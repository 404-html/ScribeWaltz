1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,190
We're going to review a proposition now.
If I ever tell you something in enough

2
00:00:13,191 --> 00:00:15,350
detail that you've already heard that
you're like,

3
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,170
you've heard it enough,
please tell me because I can't.

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,650
I can't precisely remember what I told
you.

5
00:00:21,651 --> 00:00:26,330
I know the line of the narrative
throughout the entire course and we will

6
00:00:26,331 --> 00:00:30,020
return to some things fairly frequently,
but I don't want to tell you the same

7
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:31,310
story three times.
You know,

8
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:32,220
unless you're,
you know,

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,710
particularly compelled by that story,
so let me know.

10
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,850
I'm going to start with the proposition
and the proposition is that in order to

11
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:48,230
orient yourself properly in life,
there's two classes of information that

12
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:53,060
you have to have access to and one class
of information is information about the

13
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:58,061
nature of the object of world and the
object of world is described in a manner

14
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:01,580
or the world when it's treated
objectively.

15
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,450
Is it described in a manner that strips
all the subjectivity from it?

16
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:08,140
Right?
That's the technology that the

17
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:13,660
philosophical technology that's behind
the scientific revolution involve

18
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:19,251
stripping the subjectivity from,
from the sense mediated consequences of

19
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,550
certain kinds of actions.
Right?

20
00:01:22,551 --> 00:01:25,190
Because when you lay on an experiment,
you're not just talking about what

21
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:27,710
happened,
you're talking about what you did and

22
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:30,350
then what happened,
and you're supposed to be able to do it

23
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:33,110
in a way that ensures that if someone
else followed exactly the same

24
00:01:33,111 --> 00:01:35,480
procedure,
they would obviously observe the same

25
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:40,750
consequences and in some sense we're
trying to establish a realm of knowledge

26
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:46,340
that is universally applicable to people
despite their individual differences.

27
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,240
That's one way of thinking about it and
obviously that works.

28
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,970
Now,
whether or not it works in a Darwinian

29
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:56,000
sense,
we still have to determine because it

30
00:01:56,001 --> 00:02:00,680
could easily be that our development of
the scientific method is what will make

31
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:05,270
us go extinct and which and under which
circumstances you might consider it to

32
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:09,080
have been an error,
but it doesn't really matter at the

33
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:12,140
moment because so far so good.
Roughly speaking.

34
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,620
So
now you know,

35
00:02:15,621 --> 00:02:18,890
people think that the world is an
objective place because we can describe

36
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:20,690
it objectively and not so much more

37
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,500
debatable presupposition.
It's partly debatable because it's

38
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:32,300
actually based on a decision in some
sense rather than evidence.

39
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,810
Partly because your knowledge is finite
in every direction in some sense.

40
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:42,500
So what that means in a way is that no
matter what you know about anything,

41
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:44,330
you don't know everything about that
thing.

42
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,210
And so you kind of ground out in
ignorance at some point.

43
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,870
So what that means is that you have to
buttress your thinking with a set of

44
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,870
assumptions that you don't question or
you just ended up in an infinite

45
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:57,620
regress.
And one of those sets of assumptions is

46
00:02:57,621 --> 00:03:02,621
usually reality sets of assumptions or
truth definitions,

47
00:03:03,831 --> 00:03:06,670
sets of assumptions.
But the thing is generally,

48
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:10,480
no matter what your theory of reality is
or what your theory of truth is,

49
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,110
there are alternative theories of
reality and alternative theories of

50
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:18,760
truth that are equally rigorous and that
have different domains of application.

51
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,910
And it's a very tricky business.
So,

52
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,223
um,

53
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,000
so for example,
if you're a reductionist,

54
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,390
materialist,
you're going to make the presupposition

55
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,420
that a brain physiology is more real
than emotional experience.

56
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:44,630
And I suppose that's in some sense
because you can't get access to anyone

57
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:46,940
else's emotional experience,
at least not directly.

58
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:51,110
Whereas you can get universal access to
the fundamental details of someone's

59
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:53,690
brain physiology.
It's something like that anyways.

60
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:59,030
Now that still an arbitrary assumption
because obviously the person and you as

61
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:02,930
well are going to be acting all the time
as if your emotions and your motivation,

62
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,890
motivational states are real and so then
you run into a problem and the problem

63
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:07,580
is,
well,

64
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,980
how do you know what someone actually
believes?

65
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:14,750
Do you listen to what they say or or do
you take into account their explicit and

66
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:17,960
well articulated theories or do you
watch how they act?

67
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,370
And the answer to that is

68
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,590
you take your,
you make your choice,

69
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,750
and generally there are reasons for
that.

70
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,000
Now,
one of the,

71
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,150
one of the conceptual tools that I have
found helpful in my attempts to avoid

72
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:38,740
confusion when dealing with the fact
that there are very many ways of looking

73
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:43,741
at the world is to start thinking about
theories of reality as tools rather than

74
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:48,070
as descriptions.
And I find that extraordinarily useful

75
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:52,150
as a metaphor because you know you can.
If you have a toolbox full of tools,

76
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:56,440
you don't necessarily try to reduce the
utility of one tool to another and you

77
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:59,170
don't actually complain because all the
tools aren't the same.

78
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,910
You know,
a ranch isn't a very good hammer,

79
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:04,780
but that doesn't mean you can criticize
it on that grounds.

80
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,120
It's,
you might not want to use it as a

81
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:09,340
hammer,
although you could I suppose,

82
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:13,180
but it's not justifiable criticism and
it looks to me,

83
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,990
and this is something a psychologist
named George Kelly pointed out as well,

84
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:19,630
although I think it's also an element of
pragmatic philosophy,

85
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:20,890
is that I'm

86
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,450
one set of tools for one thing and
another set of tools for another thing

87
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,290
and that's helpful.
That's helpful.

88
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,490
And so,
and then you know,

89
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,440
you are also thinking about the sorts of
problems that you like solve with

90
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:40,490
different forms of tools and one problem
is what are things made of in an

91
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:41,870
objective sense,
let's say.

92
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,550
And then another problem might be,
well what is the landscape of

93
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:48,950
experience?
And that's more of a phenomenological

94
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,840
problem.
That's the problem the phenomenologists

95
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:53,810
set out.
And then the other problem might be how

96
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:59,140
do you and should you conduct yourself,
and it could easily be that you can't

97
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,620
use the same tool to solve all those
problems.

98
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:07,880
And I would say that's particularly true
technically when you're dealing with

99
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:10,460
science because science by its very
nature,

100
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:14,930
refuses to answer questions about what
it is that you should do apart from some

101
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:17,250
implicit assumption that you should do
science,

102
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,400
which is actually not,
well,

103
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,310
that's actually not a scientific
assumption by the way,

104
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,200
because it's a moral assumption.

105
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,150
And the moral assumption is that if you
conduct yourself in a scientific manner,

106
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,730
things would be better,
right?

107
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:34,820
Because why would you run around doing
science to make things worse?

108
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:37,820
Although you absolutely you can,
you absolutely can.

109
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,010
And,
and we perhaps we are,

110
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,030
you know,
and,

111
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,200
and,
and even if we aren't,

112
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,440
we still might.
So,

113
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,910
so what's one of the things that I find
quite interesting about the scientific

114
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:48,950
endeavor,
and this is something you observed,

115
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:52,250
was that it has to be nested in
something outside of itself to give it

116
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:55,220
its motive force.
It has to be nested in a system of moral

117
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:59,900
assumptions and the fundamental moral
assumption is the world will be a better

118
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:03,350
place if we conduct ourselves along
scientific lines because otherwise why

119
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,050
do it?
And that's a statement that cannot be

120
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:10,100
analyzed from within the confines of the
scientific worldview because it doesn't

121
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,930
analyze those sorts of questions.

122
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,190
Now you could say they're not real,
but that's a stupid answer because I

123
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:17,024
think it's,
it's a,

124
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,300
it's a cop out.
Maybe it's not a stupid answer,

125
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,970
probably yes,
but at least it's a cop out because you,

126
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,490
if you don't take that question
seriously,

127
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:29,660
you can't really justify engaging in the
activity and so you can refuse to answer

128
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:31,280
it,
but you're basically answering it by

129
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,130
engaging in the activity anyway.
So even if you're not saying it,

130
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:36,230
you're still justifying it.
Alright.

131
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:40,490
So you know,
so I'm assuming that you can draw

132
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:43,730
conclusions from people's actions like
you can from their statements and it's

133
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:46,850
hard really to dispute that.
I would say if you're wise.

134
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:49,070
In fact,
I think you derive conclusions from

135
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:50,630
their actions then from their
statements.

136
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,760
So.
Okay,

137
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:56,030
so that's,
that's the under belly of the first

138
00:07:56,031 --> 00:08:00,500
proposition and the first,
the development of that is something

139
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:05,501
like the means by which information is
transmitted that is relevant to the

140
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:11,720
domain of behavior is not the same means
by which it's transmitted by which

141
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:15,230
scientific information is transmitted
and we kind of know that too,

142
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:18,320
you know,
without any real debate I believe

143
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:22,520
because how old do you think science is
as a technical endeavor?

144
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,290
What would you estimate?

145
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,530
Okay.

146
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,290
Hundreds of years,
maybe thousands of years if you're

147
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,820
willing to give it the Greeks some
credit,

148
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,200
but really probably not.
Probably hundreds because I ever

149
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,130
stopped.
Aristotle wasn't a scientist,

150
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,880
like he wasn't a bad observer,
but he certainly wasn't empirical

151
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:45,860
observer and no one got science
straightened out.

152
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:50,090
Dylan's probably what Newton Descartes
Bacon and you know,

153
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:51,830
there's a handful of other characters
who were,

154
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,470
who were thinking around those that
period of time and they sort of,

155
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,320
you know,
establish the proper methods really.

156
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:01,110
And also the philosophy that underlies
not very old,

157
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:02,340
600 years,
you know,

158
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,420
500 years,
man,

159
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:05,340
that's really nothing.
It's the blink of an eye.

160
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,910
It's yesterday.
If that,

161
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:11,300
it might even be like an hour ago,
it's,

162
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:15,930
it's nothing,
but obviously people were transmitting

163
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:20,931
information about how to act to each
other for untold millennia before that

164
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:26,220
and it's probably more like,
it depends on what you're willing to

165
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:31,490
consider transmission of information,
but even Octopi can imitate,

166
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,200
you know,
and so they're the smartest

167
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:35,550
invertebrates.
They're quite bright.

168
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:37,380
Those things,
they're not exactly sure how smart.

169
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:40,020
They only live a couple of years so they
can't really get things going,

170
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:42,540
you know,
but they can problem solve.

171
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,390
They can pull carts out of bottles to
get like a crab in a bottle.

172
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:48,780
And then if they watch an octopus,
an octopus watches another octopus,

173
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:51,900
pull the cork out of a bottle to get a
tasty crab,

174
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,210
then that octopus now knows how to do
it.

175
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,060
So which is pretty impressive.
And you can kind of see why occupied

176
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,080
might be able to do that because not
only do they have a brain,

177
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,080
but they have little technically
appendages which allow them to

178
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:05,040
manipulate things.

179
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,310
Right.
And so one of the pre cursors to being

180
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:12,270
able to be intelligent in any active way
is that you have to have tentatively

181
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,180
appendages so that you can manipulate
the world,

182
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,760
right?
And at least for it to be anything

183
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:19,920
resembling what we would consider
intelligence.

184
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:22,770
And that's part of the reason that
dolphins really art as intelligent as

185
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:24,810
people like to think because what are
they going to do?

186
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,750
You can't build cities with their
flippers,

187
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,820
you know,
they are kind of trapped in their test,

188
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:31,940
two bodies and the same thing applies to
whale.

189
00:10:31,941 --> 00:10:35,790
So obviously they have very large brains
and they're very social and they can

190
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:39,390
learn and,
but whatever their intelligence is,

191
00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:42,590
it's not like our intelligence because
we run around tearing things apart and

192
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:45,210
putting them back together.
We've got the body for that.

193
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,470
So.
Alright.

194
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,130
So anyways,
long before we were practicing science,

195
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,570
we were doing perfectly well in a sense
without any real knowledge of the

196
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,480
objective world at all,
or at least not in scientific knowledge

197
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:59,850
of the objective world.
And so another thing that you might

198
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:04,200
observe about that is that you can
survive perfectly well without knowing

199
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,890
any science at all or in an articulated
and developed manner.

200
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,220
Of course animals are in that category.
So that also I think in some sense

201
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,330
undermines the claim of science to
anything approaching a universal truth

202
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:21,930
because obviously life can get along
perfectly well without it now.

203
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,020
It depends to some degree on whether
you're a Darwinian or a Newtonian

204
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:36,460
comments on what people should do.
This more feature of modern science than

205
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:42,000
it is a science in general because I'm
thinking like someone like,

206
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,460
I don't know if he knows,
I don't know.

207
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,610
Okay,
well if it's his maxim,

208
00:11:49,611 --> 00:11:54,611
is that basically it's wrong always for
anyone everywhere to believe anything on

209
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:58,870
his evidence.
And he sort of says that he's a

210
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:00,840
mathematician who tries to prove it on
a,

211
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:04,630
on a moral basis.
Of course it's still not scientific

212
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,970
because that kind of claim can't really
be signed.

213
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,121
Yeah.
Well,

214
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:13,121
I mean obviously the people who began
the scientific revolution thought of it

215
00:12:13,821 --> 00:12:15,590
as part of a moral movement,
right?

216
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:17,090
I mean,
it was part of the enlightenment that

217
00:12:17,091 --> 00:12:21,590
was part of bringing clarity to our
conceptualizations of the world and that

218
00:12:21,591 --> 00:12:24,720
was supposed to be a positive thing,
but you know,

219
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,250
the only,
the only issue is,

220
00:12:26,251 --> 00:12:30,050
is that claim seems to be outside of the
claim of science in some sense.

221
00:12:30,051 --> 00:12:33,170
So anyways,
you get the picture with regards to the

222
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:33,831
argument.
Okay,

223
00:12:33,831 --> 00:12:35,990
so now the next step might be,
well,

224
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:41,290
if you need or can utilize or there
exists information that is not strictly

225
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,590
scientific,
one might be,

226
00:12:48,591 --> 00:12:50,510
well where did that information come
from?

227
00:12:50,511 --> 00:12:53,300
That that's a good one.
How is it transmitted?

228
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,020
That's another one and the worst of it
is of course is how might it be

229
00:12:57,021 --> 00:12:58,570
verified,
you know,

230
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,580
because one of the issues,
one of the things that scientists have

231
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:06,581
really got down and it's a major deal,
is that they can lay forth at theory of

232
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:09,410
truth and then they can operate within
that theory of truth and pretty much

233
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:11,990
everybody can agree on what it is now.

234
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,510
And the more well established the
science,

235
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,750
the more that's the case.
So like people don't really doubt

236
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:20,180
Einstein's.
People already don't doubt quantum

237
00:13:20,181 --> 00:13:23,480
theory anymore and you guys don't doubt
it because there you are using your

238
00:13:23,481 --> 00:13:26,750
computers and you wouldn't be able to
use your computers if quantum theory

239
00:13:26,751 --> 00:13:28,670
wasn't right,
so you know it's right.

240
00:13:28,671 --> 00:13:32,000
Certainly right enough,
but even more impressively than not,

241
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,400
what?
Whenever someone has tried to prove it

242
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:38,870
wrong in any possible way,
even if it's more most bizarre

243
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:42,650
predictions over the last hundred and
some years,

244
00:13:42,651 --> 00:13:44,840
it's passed every test with flying
colors.

245
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,890
So you know you can make pretty damn
solid truth claims from within the

246
00:13:48,891 --> 00:13:52,340
scientific perspective.
Now the problem is it's a lot harder to

247
00:13:52,341 --> 00:13:56,990
do that from within a moral perspective
and there's all sorts of reasons for

248
00:13:56,991 --> 00:14:01,610
that.
And one reason might be that there is a

249
00:14:01,611 --> 00:14:06,611
certain amount of situational complexity
related to every moral question that you

250
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:07,820
can't reduce.

251
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,430
So for example,
imagine that you're a clinical

252
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,910
psychologist and you're listening.
I've been in this situation and you're

253
00:14:13,911 --> 00:14:16,730
listening to two people who know each
other very well.

254
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,560
Maybe a husband and wife,
um,

255
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:22,940
discuss their last argument.
And you might say,

256
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,920
well,
you might think,

257
00:14:24,921 --> 00:14:28,490
well let's get to the bottom of this.
Let's find out what this argument is

258
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:30,840
about.
And you might think if you were

259
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,670
scientifically inclined that it is in
fact about something,

260
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,830
which means that if you investigated
long enough you can actually figure out

261
00:14:39,831 --> 00:14:42,830
what the facts are.
But I actually don't believe that's

262
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:45,890
true.
And the reason I don't believe it's true

263
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:47,420
is this.
So imagine,

264
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,030
imagine you have.
There's this old joke about these two

265
00:14:50,031 --> 00:14:50,960
friends,
like they're,

266
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,710
they're like 85 years old and they're
sitting on a park bench feeding the

267
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:59,711
pigeons and one friend says to the other
64 and the other guy cracks up and

268
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,850
laughs like mad about that.

269
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,720
And then the other guy says 83 and the
other guy cracks up and laughed like mad

270
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:08,090
about that.
And somebody watching them and wondering

271
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:11,660
what in the world is going on?
And so the person comes over and says to

272
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:12,590
these old guys,
well,

273
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:13,760
what's the scope here?
You,

274
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,940
all you're doing there is sitting there
saying memories to each other.

275
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:19,070
And then you're laughing uproariously.
I mean,

276
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:20,630
I,
I just don't get it.

277
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,291
And they say,
well,

278
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:26,090
we've known each other for so long that
we've heard each other's jokes at least

279
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,060
100 times and so we have them completely
memorized.

280
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:32,590
So a couple of years ago we decided we
just numbered the damn things and it

281
00:15:32,591 --> 00:15:34,440
would take a lot less time to tell them
and you know,

282
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,880
we,
we could laugh more of that.

283
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,880
And so,
okay.

284
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:40,220
So,
so it's an interesting little joke,

285
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,860
you know,
because it shed some light on the nature

286
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:45,860
of deep relationships and if you have a
deep relationship with them,

287
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,560
with someone while here's how you can
think about it.

288
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,830
Imagine you're trying to analyze an
essay.

289
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:57,940
Now I've actually built an essay writing
module which is on my site to 30

290
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,570
website.
It's,

291
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,170
I don't remember which template it is,
but I'll tell you in a while,

292
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:07,190
it's based on this theory of meaning,
roughly speaking,

293
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:09,350
and you should use it to write your
essay because if you do,

294
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:11,740
it'll be a way better essay.
So here's the,

295
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,700
here's the issue,
when you're reading an essay,

296
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:19,210
where is the meaning?
Well that's a hard one because first of

297
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:22,210
all it might be in many places.
That's.

298
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,130
So the question might be badly
formulated in some sense because it

299
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:26,480
might be at many places.
So let,

300
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,380
let's,
let's,

301
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,110
let's think it through logically.
Well you need the letters if it's an

302
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:32,810
alphabetic,
if it's written in alphabetic script and

303
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:36,230
so obviously some of the meeting is in
the letters and then the letters are

304
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,860
combined in certain particular ways and
that gives you some words and then the

305
00:16:39,861 --> 00:16:43,100
words are combined in some particular
ways and that gives you phrases and the

306
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:46,280
phrases are joined together in sentences
and then the sentences are strung

307
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:49,280
together in some reasonably coherent
manner.

308
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,090
So they kind of go from start to end in
a paragraph and then the paragraphs are

309
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:57,470
strung together in a coherent manner to
make up the totality of the essay.

310
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,980
And then one of the things I've noticed
when I've been trying to figure out how

311
00:17:00,981 --> 00:17:05,540
to grade essays and how to assess them
is that you can do a good or a bad job

312
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:09,170
at any one of those levels.
So like a really bad essay.

313
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,600
It's full of spelling mistakes,
right?

314
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:16,220
The words are inappropriate because the
person doesn't actually understand them,

315
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:19,040
so they're awkwardly used.
The phrases are put together in a

316
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:22,130
cliched manner.
The sentence structure isn't good.

317
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,680
The sentences aren't even in the write
paragraphs,

318
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:29,630
much less organized properly.
The paragraphs don't flow from one to

319
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:33,800
another in what might be called the.
That's kind of where the skeleton of the

320
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,960
story is.
It's sort of the most important level in

321
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:36,710
some sense.

322
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:41,030
And then even if that wasn't all wrong,
there's actually no idea there anyways.

323
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:46,930
And then you can also read essays that
have one or more of those flaws or or

324
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,110
you know,
some combination of all of them.

325
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,130
So very frequently I read a student's
essay and this often happens with smart

326
00:17:56,131 --> 00:18:01,131
creative students who are very badly
educated and that would be probably

327
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,510
50 percent of the people in this class.
I would bet,

328
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:10,380
and I say that for genuine reasons
because I run a fourth year seminar

329
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,610
where I have people write extensively
and so what they do is they write a four

330
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:19,380
page essay and then I complained about
it and and all those levels of analysis

331
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:22,890
and then they write the same,
see again in six pages and then I do the

332
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:26,730
same thing and then they write the same
essay and eight pages and the first half

333
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:30,860
of the first essays are terrible and you
know that's partly because students do

334
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:32,310
you try out as triaged,
right?

335
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,881
They think,
well,

336
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:36,090
do I really have to work in this course?
I'll work a bit and see what happens and

337
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:39,540
if I get slapped and I'll work a little
harder and if I don't then I can devote

338
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,120
my time to other courses.
Which is a perfectly reasonable thing to

339
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,450
do.
But some of it's just pure inability.

340
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,460
But what's really fascinating is that by
the end of the course,

341
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:52,350
all of the students are writing well and
it's pathetic as far as I'm concerned

342
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:54,930
because it meant that everybody could
have been taught to write 10 years ago,

343
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:57,570
but they just weren't.
So anyways,

344
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:01,290
if you look at this template that I laid
out,

345
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,490
then it will help you with this because
it walks you through the process of

346
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:08,850
writing property and that's an
extraordinarily useful thing to be able

347
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:10,200
to do.
So anyways,

348
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,140
so,
so now and then I'll read an essay and

349
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:16,050
everything is wrong about it,
but there's a really smart idea in it.

350
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,290
And then knowing this multilevel idea
with regards to meaning,

351
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,011
I could say,
look,

352
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:21,810
you know,
you're smarter than you can,

353
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:24,150
right?
And so there's really something here,

354
00:19:24,151 --> 00:19:26,310
but you know,
here's all the things that are wrong

355
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:26,970
with it.
But,

356
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,330
and then you get a worse situation in
some sense where everything about the

357
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:32,160
essay is good,
but the idea isn't.

358
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,150
And so the words are good and the
phrases to sentences are right that it

359
00:19:36,151 --> 00:19:38,070
goes together,
but it adds up to nothing.

360
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:41,730
And those are tough to grade because you
give them a c maybe or b,

361
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,700
because I probably give them a b and the
person comes up and says,

362
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,980
where did I make a mistake?
It's like,

363
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,200
well,
you didn't really make a mistake,

364
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:50,730
you just didn't do anything.
Right.

365
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,140
You know?
And,

366
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,940
and that's,
that's a whole different problem

367
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:55,590
anyways.
Okay.

368
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:58,050
So you think that's pretty complex with
regards to an essay?

369
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,300
Where's the meaning?
But that isn't where the meaning is.

370
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:03,290
So here,
let me,

371
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,460
let me give you an example.
I was thinking about this the other day.

372
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:09,300
So the ethnicity and the cultural
backgrounds of my students have changed

373
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:10,830
quite radically over the years.
Right.

374
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:12,480
And so when I started teaching this
course,

375
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:15,150
for example,
and my personality course as well,

376
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:18,690
which would have been 30 years ago,
I can take it for granted that everybody

377
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:22,530
in the room with no the basic biblical
stories and they would know the Judeo

378
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,780
Christian version of the.
Not say the Islam version of them.

379
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,570
Well that's gone.
And so that's really,

380
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:31,680
that's really made it difficult for me
in some ways because there's a bunch of

381
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:34,470
things.
There's a bunch of collective knowledge

382
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,430
that might constitute a shared set of
cultural assumptions that I can no

383
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:42,180
longer presume and it means there's all
sorts of things that I either can't talk

384
00:20:42,181 --> 00:20:47,181
about or if I'm going to talk about I
have to step way back and start from

385
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:51,820
start from first principles let's say,
and so that's also made me think so

386
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,320
because if I.

387
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,350
let's say you write me an essay and
let's say it's a psychology essay,

388
00:20:56,351 --> 00:20:58,270
okay,
now you're going to presume that there's

389
00:20:58,271 --> 00:21:02,110
a whole bunch of things I know about
psychology that you also know and the

390
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:03,880
reason you're going to presume that is
because we're.

391
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,220
We come from,
we're for the purpose of this

392
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:08,830
conversation.
We're going to come from the same

393
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:11,490
cultural background and what that means
is we,

394
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:16,560
we share a set of assumptions and we
don't have to say what those assumptions

395
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:19,270
are.
We can assume them and then we can talk

396
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:22,180
about the things that we disagree about.
And of course that's what you're doing

397
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,850
when you're writing an essay.
We're having a conversation right here.

398
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,000
You're saying,
well obviously you and have to talk

399
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:29,800
about what we know because we already
know it.

400
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,700
We want to push that a little bit so we
start to talk a little bit about the

401
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:38,701
things that we don't know,
but no more so than we both understand.

402
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,890
So then you think,
well damn it,

403
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:44,080
the meaning of the essay isn't in the
essay at all.

404
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:47,950
It's in the interaction between the
shared cultural assumptions of the

405
00:21:47,951 --> 00:21:51,040
writer and the reader and the asset.
Well,

406
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:51,881
and then you think,
well,

407
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:55,200
it's worse than that even because the
shared cultural assumptions are into

408
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,110
their own sort of network and then
that's nested inside of it.

409
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:02,740
Very broad historical network and then
that's nested inside an extraordinarily

410
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:07,741
broad biological network and it's like
actually you can continue expanding the

411
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:13,711
outer reaches of the essay without limit
and so part of that means it's actually

412
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:18,850
impossible to specify the meaning of the
essay.

413
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:24,100
It's something that you both work at in
combination as writer and as a reader,

414
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,880
but it's very fluid and flexible and
that's that problem is actually partly

415
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:30,940
why the postmodernist Scott going
because they sort of noticed this,

416
00:22:30,941 --> 00:22:32,650
I mean corrupt as they are.

417
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,620
They did notice at one point that it was
very,

418
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:40,621
very difficult to say what any given
phrase paragraph or even essay meant

419
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,980
because it wasn't in that it wasn't
there.

420
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,800
Like it's not in the book.
It's sort of in the book.

421
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:51,160
But you know this too.
If you listen,

422
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,440
you know,
you listen to a piece of music,

423
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,320
you know.
So let's say you had a favorite song

424
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:57,500
when you were 14,
you know,

425
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,580
and when you first heard that,
so I'm maybe you didn't like it that

426
00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:02,140
much,
but then you heard it four times and you

427
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:02,681
think,
man,

428
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,320
that's one excellent song.
And then at some point you've heard it

429
00:23:05,321 --> 00:23:07,480
so many times if you never want to hear
it again.

430
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,060
And it's.
And that's interesting too because it

431
00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:13,750
means the song has transformed in
relationship to your historical,

432
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,840
in interactions with it.
You might say,

433
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:18,610
well no,
the song is the same.

434
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,450
It's like,
well,

435
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:25,230
it depends on what you mean by the song,
the notes or the same experiences.

436
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:27,880
Certainly transport.
So.

437
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:28,990
Okay,
so anyways,

438
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,570
back to the couple that are sitting
there talking.

439
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:33,640
They're having this argument,
they're trying to sort out what this is

440
00:23:33,641 --> 00:23:35,320
about and the problem is,
well,

441
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:38,320
it's about everything that the argument
is about plus everything that's ever

442
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:41,260
happened to them in their relationship
because you know,

443
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,860
if someone has told you the same thing
50 times,

444
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,910
it is not the same thing as the thing
they told you the first time,

445
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,370
right?
God only knows how many transformations

446
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:55,730
it's gone through as it's been
continually repeated and how many

447
00:23:55,731 --> 00:23:59,900
different arguments it's been embedded
in and and how many things you have to

448
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:02,960
know to understand the shades of
intonation and all of that,

449
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:06,620
but basically each other instead a
couple of producers is,

450
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,930
is it's meaning as determined by the
entire history of interactions that

451
00:24:11,931 --> 00:24:15,220
those two people have had and so how do
you,

452
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,610
how are you going to specify that?

453
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,460
It's very,
very difficult to specify it.

454
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,520
Now you really can,
and it's also difficult to know when

455
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:25,520
you've specified it enough,
you know,

456
00:24:25,521 --> 00:24:29,480
so one of the things that's interesting
about training as a psychoanalyst is

457
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:32,320
that
it's it.

458
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:37,530
It starts to become an absolutely mind
boggling how much archeology you can do,

459
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,810
you can undertake underneath a single
statement,

460
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,740
especially if it's delivered with a bit
of an edge and some contempt.

461
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,900
It's like there are just levels and
levels and levels and levels and levels

462
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:53,660
of meaning underneath that.
And you can tell that when you're

463
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:58,220
engaged in an argument like that because
someone will trigger you,

464
00:24:58,221 --> 00:25:01,140
let's say for lack of a better word and
you know,

465
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,130
they'll have broken a rule that you've
established with them and you're both in

466
00:25:04,131 --> 00:25:07,340
a pit and you know,
the fight is about that path.

467
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:11,060
Even though maybe it's about some
surface thing and you're just running

468
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:11,330
around.

469
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:14,390
They're like racks that are lit on fire
and there's nothing you can do about it.

470
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:15,224
You know,
and it's,

471
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,570
it's,
it's a consequence of all the issues

472
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:21,400
that are lurking beneath the surface of
that speech act.

473
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:24,320
That seemed to be something you can
capture it on video.

474
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:24,890
You'd say,
well,

475
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,570
here's what you said,
there's a video tape recording them.

476
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,423
It's like,
no,

477
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,240
that's not what you said,
because the videotape does not capture

478
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:35,480
the context and it can't,
so you can't even get an objective

479
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:39,740
record of the meaning of a conversation
because the meaning isn't right in the

480
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:41,540
conversation.
So okay,

481
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:44,810
so that's one of the problems.
One of the problems with trying to

482
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:49,670
validate moral claims is that you've got
this insane contextual complexity that's

483
00:25:49,671 --> 00:25:53,570
almost impossible to dispose up and so
you could say,

484
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,710
you could even say that if person a did
action a in situation a,

485
00:25:57,711 --> 00:26:01,700
that would be right and a person beaded
action a and situation a that would be

486
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:06,230
wrong and it depends on the person and
so it's very easy to slip from that into

487
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:10,790
a kind of moral relativism because how
in the world do you deal with the

488
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:12,710
complexity and how do you make a truth
claim?

489
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:17,690
And so I would really say in some sense
that's this intellectual situation in

490
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:19,040
modern universities.
Now,

491
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,770
the other thing that's kind of
interesting is this was actually

492
00:26:21,771 --> 00:26:25,460
discovered in a number of different
fields simultaneously,

493
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,720
so just as the literary theorists
started to discover,

494
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,820
say,
after World War II that it was really,

495
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,420
it wasn't enough to say that a book has
meaning in it,

496
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,840
that there's something wrong with that
and that there isn't a single meeting.

497
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:42,350
There's a multiplicity of meanings and
it's not even a stable multiplicity of

498
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,600
meanings.
People were finding that out in in other

499
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,370
domains as well.
For example,

500
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,100
in artificial intelligence where it
became very,

501
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:55,101
very obvious very rapidly that
perceiving a simple object was not

502
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:59,520
simple because objects aren't sample and
the border between one object and

503
00:26:59,521 --> 00:27:02,040
another is in some sense arbitrary,
right?

504
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:03,660
I mean,
when I look at each of you,

505
00:27:03,661 --> 00:27:05,820
I sort of see you as entities,
right?

506
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:09,240
But that's because I see you at this
level of resolution.

507
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,420
You know,
your cellular masses at a different

508
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,690
level of resolution,
your molecular composites at a different

509
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:20,040
level of resolution.
There are 10 times you're made up of 10

510
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:24,120
times as many bacteria as cells at
another level of resolution.

511
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:28,050
So really you're more like an ocean,
then you are like an entity and then

512
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,040
well is it you or your family,
that's the real or is it you,

513
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:35,220
your family and your culture?
What about your species or you know,

514
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,290
or are you a mammal?
It's like

515
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:44,480
all of those things and all of those
things and any of those things at the

516
00:27:44,481 --> 00:27:45,940
same time.
And so when I look at you,

517
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:49,050
what am I supposed to see?
You know,

518
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,100
do I see individual with name or do I
see ethnicity or dyc?

519
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,920
Well,
you get the picture.

520
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,360
So object perception turns out to be
extraordinarily difficult because things

521
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:05,090
aren't just simple objects,
even if they're relatively simple.

522
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,530
Alright?
So

523
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,270
you throw up your hands,
you think,

524
00:28:11,271 --> 00:28:13,190
well,
how can there ever be any harmony?

525
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,490
How can you draw any sense out of that?
Okay,

526
00:28:16,491 --> 00:28:18,830
so that's the argument against drawing
any sense out of it.

527
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,920
But then let's,
let's try the other tack.

528
00:28:21,921 --> 00:28:26,170
Let's see if we can make a case for
there being some sense to the claims of,

529
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,240
of that,
that moral claims can be validated.

530
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:30,710
Okay?
So here's a question for you.

531
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,390
If you took a bunch of chimpanzees that
didn't know each other and you threw

532
00:28:35,391 --> 00:28:40,391
them in this classroom,
what you would have is a war right now,

533
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:44,150
you're roughly in that situation.
Not exactly because,

534
00:28:44,151 --> 00:28:45,620
hey,
you're not chimpanzees,

535
00:28:45,621 --> 00:28:48,470
but you know,
your genetic material is quite

536
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,090
reasonably related.
Um,

537
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,330
I mean,
you only split off your common ancestor

538
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:57,030
7 million years ago and that seems like
a long time in a day,

539
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,030
but it's not 300 million years ago.

540
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,640
You know,
it's still relatively recently from the

541
00:29:01,641 --> 00:29:04,040
evolutionary perspective here.
You all are.

542
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:08,570
You don't really know each other.
You obviously share important elements

543
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:10,280
of identity.
So you're all students,

544
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:13,760
but you can come in here and all of a
sudden you all know what to do and no

545
00:29:13,761 --> 00:29:16,430
one,
no one fights or if they do fight,

546
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,280
it's,
there are very constrained rules around

547
00:29:19,281 --> 00:29:23,000
the fighting and everyone accepts them.
And it seems hard to say that that's not

548
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:26,150
better than the alternative.
So you know,

549
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,360
unless you want to come in here and have
an APP still chaotic

550
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,193
war.

551
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:37,740
So somehow we've managed to figure out
how we can at least brings relative

552
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:41,620
strangers together in a relatively high
pressure situation because we were

553
00:29:41,621 --> 00:29:45,850
learning about complicated and
challenging things and everybody gets

554
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,910
along and everybody's kind of happy
about that.

555
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:52,360
So it looks like we can figure out
patterns of behavior that.

556
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,390
Well then the question is,
are they correct,

557
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,660
are they morally correct or they write
or do they work?

558
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,420
And then you might also ask yourself,
well,

559
00:30:01,421 --> 00:30:03,250
what's the difference between all of
those claims?

560
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:05,560
Is there a similarity or difference
between those claims?

561
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,950
So,
and then you might ask yourself,

562
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,760
okay,
so here,

563
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,180
here's something else you might think
about.

564
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,603
So

565
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,490
let's say you're playing monopoly.
How many of you have played monopoly in

566
00:30:19,491 --> 00:30:20,880
your life?
Okay,

567
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,550
is there anyone here who hasn't played
monopoly?

568
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,880
Excellent.
A cultural universal.

569
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:31,550
So I'm obviously in some ways it doesn't
matter if you get all those little

570
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,800
hotels right?
Okay.

571
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:41,150
But on the other hand,
if you act like it doesn't matter while

572
00:30:41,151 --> 00:30:43,520
you're playing monopoly,
then people hit you with things and they

573
00:30:43,521 --> 00:30:45,790
should.
Because part of the rule is you're gonna

574
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,870
act like this matters because if you
don't,

575
00:30:47,871 --> 00:30:50,960
then it's not any fun.
So you have to act like in Madison.

576
00:30:50,961 --> 00:30:54,320
Then it turns out that when you start
playing it backs right,

577
00:30:54,321 --> 00:30:56,180
and people will actually,
they'll get angry,

578
00:30:56,181 --> 00:30:58,080
especially if you achieved,
you know,

579
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,940
but people will play monopoly so they'll
act as if the end point matters.

580
00:31:01,941 --> 00:31:02,541
And you might say,
well,

581
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:07,541
what is the end point?
And one answer is to get all the hotels

582
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:11,060
and all the money,
so to enter the one percent,

583
00:31:11,061 --> 00:31:14,300
so you have all the wealth and no one
has any and you win and you feel happy

584
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:17,300
about that even if you're a radical left
winger.

585
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,490
So that's kind of interesting.
And so,

586
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:22,400
and uh,
and then you say,

587
00:31:22,401 --> 00:31:23,630
well,
that's not really the point.

588
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:26,300
The point is to enjoy the game and you
think,

589
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:26,841
yeah,
okay.

590
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:28,590
That's probably the point too.
Um,

591
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,250
and then you might say,
well that's not really the point either.

592
00:31:31,251 --> 00:31:34,610
It's like you want to,
you want to know holding your

593
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:37,700
negotiating skills.
Do you want to spend some time with your

594
00:31:37,701 --> 00:31:39,560
friends?
Like there's lots of things going on at

595
00:31:39,561 --> 00:31:42,320
once and so,
but it doesn't really matter because

596
00:31:42,321 --> 00:31:44,360
monopoly is a game that you'll play.
Okay?

597
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,950
Now imagine instead that monopoly.
Here's the new rule for monopoly.

598
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:57,670
All the people you're playing with can
randomly steal your hotels and houses

599
00:31:57,801 --> 00:32:01,610
and your money whenever they want and
you can steal it back.

600
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,380
Okay,
so then you think,

601
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,310
well
no one's gonna play that game,

602
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:11,180
and then you think,
well why not?

603
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,150
Well,
the first surface answers,

604
00:32:14,151 --> 00:32:16,370
that's a stupid game.
Okay,

605
00:32:16,371 --> 00:32:19,190
but and you know that somehow you think
that's a stupid game,

606
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,700
but then you starting to think about,
well why is that a stupid game?

607
00:32:22,701 --> 00:32:24,470
Or you might say it's not unplayable
gate,

608
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,710
which would be a little bit more
sophisticated.

609
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,790
It's like why?
Why would that not work?

610
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,060
And you might say,
well what's the point in getting the

611
00:32:32,061 --> 00:32:35,990
hotels if someone can just take them,
but you might say what's the point?

612
00:32:35,991 --> 00:32:37,460
And getting the whole deal is anyway.
It's like,

613
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,300
who cares about the damn hotel?
It's,

614
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,320
it's a bit tricky.
There's something about the randomness

615
00:32:42,321 --> 00:32:44,600
of the,
of what's now allowed and the

616
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:49,130
unpredictability of it and the arbitrary
nature of it and its lack of a

617
00:32:49,131 --> 00:32:52,490
relationship with your own actions that
takes all the motivational impotence out

618
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:53,324
of the gate.

619
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:58,570
So one thing we might think about to
begin with is there's a difference

620
00:32:58,941 --> 00:33:03,740
between a good game and a bad game and
there's also a difference between a game

621
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:07,820
and no gate and we don't know what the
difference is exactly,

622
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,600
but there is a difference and then we
might even say,

623
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:13,940
well,
not only are there good games and bad

624
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:15,620
games,
but some good games are better than

625
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:18,620
other games.
How many of you have played settlers of

626
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,870
Catan?
Okay.

627
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:25,040
Is that better than monopoly or worse?
It's better.

628
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,480
It's anybody think it's not better?
Okay.

629
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,510
Why is it better?

630
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,250
What's better about it?
It's more complex and heard what you

631
00:33:35,251 --> 00:33:39,030
said.
We're not necessarily stealing,

632
00:33:39,031 --> 00:33:42,110
but there's a piece of the gay whether
it was

633
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,463
or something like that.

634
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,190
Yeah,
there's a robber.

635
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,690
Place him on one of the titles.

636
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,340
Again,
you can mess with people essentially.

637
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,960
So that's fun.
It is just like,

638
00:33:55,961 --> 00:33:57,550
I'm going to get you with this,
Robert.

639
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,840
It's more akin to like real life,
I think.

640
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,560
Like in monopoly.
No,

641
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,020
that's reasonable.
That's reasonable.

642
00:34:05,021 --> 00:34:07,540
That's reasonable.
It's also got a strategic element.

643
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:10,450
How many of you played risk?
Okay.

644
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:15,400
Settlers of a Katana risk
settlers.

645
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,500
Who says risk to risk to risk diehards.
What about the rest of you?

646
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,980
How many for risk?
How many first?

647
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:25,810
Settlers of Catan.
Okay.

648
00:34:25,811 --> 00:34:27,010
Okay.
So well,

649
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,700
settlers of Katana is quite a bit like
risk because it has a strategic element.

650
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,160
Right?
And there's a territorial expansion that

651
00:34:33,161 --> 00:34:35,410
goes along with it and there's also
trading,

652
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,260
which is one of the things that's nice
about monopoly and about risk.

653
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,630
Okay.
But so you can see that you have

654
00:34:40,631 --> 00:34:44,800
intuitions about what constitutes a
better game and part of the way that you

655
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,820
develop those intuitions is not exactly
philosophically because I doubt if you

656
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:52,720
really thought through white settlers of
Cape Town is a better game say than risk

657
00:34:52,721 --> 00:34:53,350
or monopoly.

658
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:58,210
For those of you that think it is,
but you aren't your own reaction and

659
00:34:58,211 --> 00:34:59,800
your own reaction is something like,
well,

660
00:34:59,801 --> 00:35:03,910
I'd rather play settlers of kc tap and
you might ask yourself why,

661
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:08,580
but you don't have to.
You can just rather play it and then so

662
00:35:08,581 --> 00:35:09,490
what?
And then you think,

663
00:35:09,491 --> 00:35:10,900
well,
what does it mean that you'd rather play

664
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:11,501
it and you'd say,
wow,

665
00:35:11,501 --> 00:35:14,770
it's more fun.
It's more enjoyable if asked

666
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,780
voluntarily,
that's the one I would pick,

667
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,690
but you don't really know why apart from
those reasons,

668
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:24,990
but obviously those are complex.
That's a complex social engagement.

669
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:30,490
Those games that are complex and and in
fact they're so complex that you can

670
00:35:30,491 --> 00:35:35,170
have preferences and not even know why.
Now that's interesting and I think the

671
00:35:35,171 --> 00:35:40,171
idea that there are games,
good games and bad games and games,

672
00:35:40,531 --> 00:35:45,090
a non games is a nice way of starting to
conceptualize what the difference might

673
00:35:45,091 --> 00:35:49,110
be doing between moral systems because
the game is actually a moral system,

674
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:49,770
right?

675
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:50,450
It,
it,

676
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,140
it has a point.
It has an end.

677
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:58,070
You have to cooperate and compete to,
to run through the gate.

678
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,720
So awhile back,
a psychologist actually started this and

679
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:05,820
and,
and it's reprehensible,

680
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,080
but psychologists have done lots of
reprehensible things and this is one of

681
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:12,510
them,
he this psychologist whose name I don't

682
00:36:12,511 --> 00:36:15,450
remember that moment was reviewing the
literature on the difference in

683
00:36:15,451 --> 00:36:18,150
aggression between boys and girls and
men and women and

684
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:24,900
boys and men are much more aggressive
depending on how you define aggressive

685
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:29,790
than girls and women.
Now that tends to be mostly true with

686
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:32,400
physical aggression.
So you might say kicking,

687
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:33,360
hitting,
biting,

688
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:34,680
punching,
stealing,

689
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,160
two year old boys for example,
the ones who do two year olds,

690
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,860
the ones who do most of that,
or boys now,

691
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:43,950
the two year old girls are a kind of
each other up behind their backs,

692
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,270
but no one measures that.
Right?

693
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:46,650
And so you find,
for example,

694
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:50,640
with female aggression,
it tends to be relationship savaging and

695
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,740
you see that on the,
in the playground,

696
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:54,930
you see it in junior high,
you see it in high school and you see it

697
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:56,850
on the net.
It's always the same thing.

698
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,220
So whether men are more aggressive than
women is,

699
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,970
depends on how you define aggression.
But men are more physically aggressive

700
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:03,990
anyways.
Um,

701
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:11,480
a while back there was this idea that
maybe we could dampen down to male

702
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:15,140
aggression by socializing little boys,
more like little girls.

703
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:16,280
So,
and,

704
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,940
and one of the offshoots of that was the
idea that we should only allow children

705
00:37:19,941 --> 00:37:22,820
to play cooperative games.
Now,

706
00:37:22,821 --> 00:37:26,000
the first thing you might notice is that
anything you've ever done that was a

707
00:37:26,001 --> 00:37:29,000
game was not cooperative,
right?

708
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,730
Like it's not a game if it's just
cooperative.

709
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:36,170
But then the other thing you might
notice is that the distinction between a

710
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:40,700
cooperative in a competitive game is far
more sophisticated than people who come

711
00:37:40,701 --> 00:37:43,160
up with those dimwitted theories about
how to improve the world,

712
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,640
whatever.
Appreciate.

713
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,740
So here's an example.

714
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,670
Hockey game.
Yes.

715
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,690
Is it an aggressive gate?
Is it a competitive game?

716
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:56,050
Is it a cooperative game?
Ha.

717
00:37:56,410 --> 00:38:00,430
Why?
Why is it a cooperative game together?

718
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,530
Right?
So there's the team,

719
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:04,990
right?
So you're obviously cooperating with

720
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,600
your team members,
but you're also maybe trying to be the

721
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:10,180
best player,
but you're also trying to be the best

722
00:38:10,181 --> 00:38:13,570
player in a way that doesn't irritate
the hell out of your team players.

723
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,190
Right?
Because that's actually,

724
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,350
there's something about that that's
counterproductive.

725
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:21,670
Like even if you're a good player,
if you're a prima donna and you hug the

726
00:38:21,671 --> 00:38:22,510
park,
say,

727
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,070
and you know,
you know,

728
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,770
maybe you're not interested in the
development of your other team members.

729
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,370
Like you're not a good player even if
you're the most talented.

730
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,170
So there's definitely a cooperative
element.

731
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,360
Is there a cooperative element beyond
that?

732
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:35,600
Well,
yeah,

733
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,060
you have to all agree to sort of
cooperating in so much as um,

734
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,320
you know,
agreeing to the rules of the game and

735
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:42,154
playing with it.

736
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,220
You don't bring a chess board or
basketball right now,

737
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,360
no matter if you're on different teams,
right?

738
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:54,250
Because you're all there to play hockey.
So just to play hockey as a cooperative

739
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:55,840
endeavor,
because think of all the other things

740
00:38:55,841 --> 00:38:58,120
you could be doing instead of playing
hockey at that time,

741
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,920
you could be doing an infinite number of
other things.

742
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,920
So really if you look at the
relationship between cooperation and

743
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,550
competition in any collaborative human
affair,

744
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,640
things are usually competitive at one
level,

745
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:12,010
cooperative and another competitive at
another.

746
00:39:12,011 --> 00:39:16,090
Like there's this continual interplay
between competition and cooperation and

747
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,740
you can't disentangle them.
Now,

748
00:39:17,741 --> 00:39:20,660
one of the things that Piaget said,
which Piaget's is,

749
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:22,920
for those of you who don't own you
probably all do now,

750
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:26,200
is perhaps the foremost developmental
psychologist of the 20th century,

751
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,270
even though he didn't think he was a
psychologist,

752
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:31,450
um,
piaget actually made the claim the

753
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:34,690
radical claim that two year olds for
example,

754
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:38,020
and this isn't Psj is clean,
but if it's associated,

755
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:41,650
if you put groups of people together and
their age matched.

756
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:45,250
So you got a group of nine months olds,
say one year olds,

757
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:46,270
two year olds,
three year olds,

758
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:47,950
four year olds,
all the way up to 18,

759
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:51,310
and you just throw them in a room maybe
with some things for them to do,

760
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:55,660
and then you count the number of violent
acts which is kicking,

761
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:56,950
hitting,
biting or stealing.

762
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,960
Okay.
Two year olds,

763
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:04,000
they're the most violent human beings
and most of them are actually aren't

764
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,370
violent.
There's a subset of them that are

765
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,380
violence,
about five to 10 percent of them.

766
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:12,310
Now almost all of those are boys.
And then if you track those boys across

767
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:14,290
time,
over the next two years,

768
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:19,291
most of them become civilized and the
ones that don't never become civilized.

769
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,270
And then so they're kind of antisocial
throughout their childhood.

770
00:40:22,271 --> 00:40:26,880
And then when testosterone kicks in at
about 14 and all the boys get antisocial

771
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,250
again,
they catch up to the always antisocial

772
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:33,310
boys.
And then the normal boys taper off quite

773
00:40:33,311 --> 00:40:36,610
dramatically at around 19 and flattened
right out by about 27.

774
00:40:36,611 --> 00:40:38,980
But the antisocial boys,
they just keep being antisocial.

775
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:44,700
So now piaget noted that there was a
dramatic transformation in,

776
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:49,570
in,
in,

777
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:54,140
in behavior or individual behavior in
relationship to the social world between

778
00:40:54,141 --> 00:40:58,430
the ages of two and four.
And if you watch two year olds play

779
00:40:58,431 --> 00:41:00,540
together,
he said that what they did fundamentally

780
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:04,490
it was like a parallel play.
So maybe there's one,

781
00:41:04,491 --> 00:41:07,400
two year old there and another two year
old there and that two year old is

782
00:41:07,401 --> 00:41:11,330
playing truck and this two year old is
playing ambulance or something or maybe

783
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,110
playing doll and they're sitting with
each other and maybe they interact a

784
00:41:15,111 --> 00:41:17,660
little bit,
but they're not playing the same game.

785
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,243
Okay.
So,

786
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,530
so what they're doing in some senses,
they're engaged in a goal directed

787
00:41:24,531 --> 00:41:27,980
activity.
It and it has a point and they're

788
00:41:27,981 --> 00:41:29,900
trying.
They're sort of integrating all their

789
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:34,901
interior subpersonalities in sense in a
way that allows them to play a single

790
00:41:35,481 --> 00:41:37,610
game with themselves.
You know?

791
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,100
And that's pretty complex from a
cognitive perspective,

792
00:41:40,101 --> 00:41:40,310
right?

793
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:44,570
Because it means there's not,
they're not fractionated and they're not

794
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:49,571
being pulled out by hunger or anger or
sadness or fear or any of those things.

795
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:54,290
And they're doing something that's
highly complex cognitively and they can

796
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:57,380
make an organized themselves well enough
to do it for a substantial period of

797
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,120
time.
So it's like it's a major developmental

798
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:01,100
advance,
but they can't do it with another

799
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,960
person.
Now,

800
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:07,520
one of Piaget's hypotheses was that they
couldn't do it do.

801
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:12,770
They couldn't play the same game with
another person without actually setting

802
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:17,060
up a competitive structure so that
actually compete.

803
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,590
Competition was a prerequisite to
cooperation.

804
00:42:19,591 --> 00:42:21,200
And so the idea was,
okay,

805
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:24,800
so if you watch how kids do this,
you can get a sense of it.

806
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,190
I mean on the one hand,
maybe they,

807
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:29,390
they all get together and they decided
to play tag.

808
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:32,000
Okay?
And everyone knows the rules for tag and

809
00:42:32,001 --> 00:42:35,060
you can win at 10,
but without the point,

810
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,510
the point in some senses,
the construction of a dominance

811
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:39,950
hierarchy of competence,
right?

812
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,720
Someone wins.
And then there's the people who are sort

813
00:42:41,721 --> 00:42:44,960
of second best and third best and
everybody's really into doing that.

814
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,300
You all have to get together.
If your kids and you say,

815
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:49,430
well what should we do?
And then he decided we're going to play

816
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:51,230
tag.
And then you set up the rules because

817
00:42:51,231 --> 00:42:55,400
there's infinite variations of tag and
then everyone goes off in place and so

818
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:59,750
it's a competitive game because only one
person can win or maybe one at a time

819
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:03,140
can win.
But once you've all agreed on that,

820
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:05,090
well then you're cooperating.
So,

821
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,870
so that's quite interesting in Psj
regarded that as necessary stage in the

822
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:11,210
development of the ability to act like a
social creature.

823
00:43:11,211 --> 00:43:13,250
And then.
And so here's,

824
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,010
here's something that happens if you're
not a very popular kid.

825
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:21,500
So let's say for kids that are playing
jacks good enough,

826
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,080
I don't think kids play jacks anymore,
but whatever,

827
00:43:24,081 --> 00:43:27,170
if they were playing jocks,
they're are sitting there playing jacks

828
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:29,720
and when you play jokes,
you bounce a ball and you pick up a jock

829
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:32,360
and manage that and the ball because you
manage that.

830
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,300
Then you drop the ball and you pick up
to Jackson,

831
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:37,610
you grew up the ball and you keep going
up to like eight jacks or whatever.

832
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,140
So now another kid wants to play Jacks
and we'll say this is a relatively

833
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:45,320
popular kid.
And so the kids sidles up to the group

834
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:49,010
that's playing and sits down because
they're all sitting down and then

835
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:53,120
watches and then maybe starts making
jack playing motions are a couple of

836
00:43:53,121 --> 00:43:58,040
comments about how the Jac game is going
and then maybe the other kids don't have

837
00:43:58,041 --> 00:44:01,700
to disrupt what they're doing very much
and they can kind of open the circle and

838
00:44:01,701 --> 00:44:03,530
let that kid scoot in and then he gets
to her,

839
00:44:03,531 --> 00:44:06,450
she gets to play Jacks to whereas a kid
that doesn't.

840
00:44:06,451 --> 00:44:09,350
And that often doesn't happen.
Even if it's a popular kid,

841
00:44:09,351 --> 00:44:11,930
sometimes the little group that's
already formed won't open.

842
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:14,150
And let the man you've been at cocktail
parties.

843
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,530
It's exactly the same thing,
right?

844
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:19,520
It's exactly the same thing.
She was supposed to hang around the edge

845
00:44:19,521 --> 00:44:22,610
of the conversation and maybe if you've
got something that isn't too stupid to

846
00:44:22,611 --> 00:44:25,430
say you can offer it,
then maybe they'd let you in.

847
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:26,660
Right?
So,

848
00:44:26,661 --> 00:44:28,670
okay,
so now if you're not very social,

849
00:44:28,671 --> 00:44:32,460
what you do is you stand out there and
you don't notice what the hell's going

850
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,610
on and you don't start to match your
body to what's happening.

851
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,860
And maybe you say,
I know want to play Jacks,

852
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,440
that's a stupid game.
Let's go do something else.

853
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:44,970
In which case the kids are not happy
with you and your unpopular and that's

854
00:44:44,971 --> 00:44:48,240
that you're stuck with it.
Because if you got that by the time of

855
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:51,330
year for about the other kids are going
to leave you so far in the dust,

856
00:44:51,331 --> 00:44:52,380
you're never going to catch up.

857
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,103
Okay?
So,

858
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,250
so what have,
what have we concluded from that?

859
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,090
We might conclude that
people play games.

860
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:02,210
There's lots of different games.
Um,

861
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:04,530
there's lots of different playable
games.

862
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,350
There might even be an infinite number
of playable games.

863
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,010
There's a lot of non playable games.
Those are the ones that aren't any fun.

864
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:13,470
And there's a lot of interactions that
aren't games.

865
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,030
Okay?
So we can all accept that.

866
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,990
And then we've added to that the
observation or the presupposition that

867
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:24,260
the ability to play games is a
prerequisite for being socialized.

868
00:45:24,991 --> 00:45:28,800
So being able to operate together with
people and that that operation has

869
00:45:28,801 --> 00:45:32,910
elements of competition and elements of
cooperation reasonable.

870
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,860
And then you might say,
well,

871
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,640
everything people do communally has a
game like aspect,

872
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,010
and you might say,
well that's actually why kids like to

873
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:46,011
play games because kids play games
because games are a simplified analog of

874
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:47,130
life.

875
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:50,520
And if you get good at playing games,
well what happens is the games you play

876
00:45:50,521 --> 00:45:53,820
become increasingly complex and more and
more real world,

877
00:45:53,821 --> 00:45:56,970
like until they're actually
indistinguishable from acting in the

878
00:45:56,971 --> 00:45:59,100
world,
but they're even then they're still

879
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:03,510
games in a sense because they could.
The rules could be different.

880
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:06,660
But then what?
The rules could be different.

881
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:07,830
But then you might think,
well,

882
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:09,690
are there things that couldn't be
different?

883
00:46:09,691 --> 00:46:10,980
And yeah,
there are some things.

884
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,500
It's going to be cooperative,
it's going to be competitive,

885
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:17,010
there's going to be ruled.
Everybody needs to agree on the rules.

886
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:20,550
People have to want to play.
This is something else piaget observed.

887
00:46:20,551 --> 00:46:22,530
It's bloody brilliant.
He thought,

888
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:26,820
well,
how could you decide if one game is

889
00:46:26,821 --> 00:46:30,030
better than another?
And that's a moral,

890
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,680
let's say that it's a moral claim in a
sense.

891
00:46:31,681 --> 00:46:33,630
Okay.
But he wanted to narrow it down so that

892
00:46:33,631 --> 00:46:35,490
it was possible that it could be
answered,

893
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,720
and what he said was,
okay,

894
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:41,370
well imagine you have group a that are
attempting to attain a goal and Group B

895
00:46:41,371 --> 00:46:43,050
that are attempting to attain a goal.

896
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:46,230
Both groups have agreed that attaining
the goal is valuable.

897
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,010
We don't have to argue about the value
of the goal.

898
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,510
We've settled that,
okay,

899
00:46:51,511 --> 00:46:53,760
now we're going to make a further
assumption,

900
00:46:53,761 --> 00:46:58,110
which is all things considered getting
towards the goal with less effort,

901
00:46:58,111 --> 00:47:00,630
more enjoyment,
and less trouble would be better.

902
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,390
Okay.
You have to take that as a given because

903
00:47:03,391 --> 00:47:05,670
it might not be.
Sometimes something difficult is better,

904
00:47:05,671 --> 00:47:07,650
but well then you might say,
okay,

905
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:14,750
would people working voluntarily or
involuntarily be more likely to reach

906
00:47:14,941 --> 00:47:19,170
that goal with less misery faster and
more effectively?

907
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:22,830
And Piaget's answer was,
if you can get people to play the game

908
00:47:22,831 --> 00:47:25,800
voluntarily,
you don't have to waste any effort on

909
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,200
enforcement.
No one kicks back.

910
00:47:28,201 --> 00:47:30,580
So the system is to be more efficient
across time.

911
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:35,000
Now that's,
that's smart because he's gone,

912
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,850
he's gone on way of conceptualizing what
might constitute a better system.

913
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:43,030
Now it's grounded in subjective
experience to some degree,

914
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:45,400
less misery,
more enjoyment.

915
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,550
Um,
but there's also a way of measuring it,

916
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,650
which is also more efficient,
you know,

917
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:54,850
or it does what it's supposed to do with
less noise and grief,

918
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,200
less costs,
let's say.

919
00:47:56,201 --> 00:47:57,250
Something like that.
So that's,

920
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:59,560
that's pretty smart.
Okay.

921
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,350
So then let's,
let's make another.

922
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,600
Well,
hmm.

923
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,450
How old do you think kids games are
like,

924
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:10,790
and I don't know what's happened to kids
in recent years because their,

925
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,310
their culture in some ways has been
seriously disrupted by television and

926
00:48:15,311 --> 00:48:18,430
computers,
but you guys are a lot younger than me.

927
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,860
Did you play hide and go seek?
Okay.

928
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:23,680
Do you know ring around the Rosie?
You know that?

929
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,650
Do you know what that is?
You don't know when you're on the road.

930
00:48:25,651 --> 00:48:29,140
So how many people don't know that that
ring around the rosy pocket full of

931
00:48:29,141 --> 00:48:30,080
posies hotshot?

932
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,990
How shall we all fall down?
Okay.

933
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,790
How many know that?
Okay,

934
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,130
it's an English nursery rhyme.
It's about the play.

935
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,430
It's about the black plate by the way,
and so that piece of dog role,

936
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,910
that piece of Ryan has been around
transmitted by the oral cultural

937
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,660
children since the time of the black
plague.

938
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:51,880
And so a lot of co children's tradition
is an oral tradition and a lot of the

939
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:53,770
games that children play are passed
along.

940
00:48:53,771 --> 00:48:54,520
My children,
you know,

941
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,550
adults might also teach them,
but kids learn how to play hide and go

942
00:48:57,551 --> 00:48:59,920
seek.
And how many of you played tag?

943
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:02,111
Right?
Ever.

944
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:04,660
Anyone never played tag,
right?

945
00:49:04,661 --> 00:49:06,340
So everyone plays tag.
What,

946
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:09,580
how would you conceptualize tag if you
were a biologist?

947
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:11,350
What do you think children are doing?

948
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,030
They're hunting,
right?

949
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:18,990
They're chasing things down.
Obviously they're chasing things down

950
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,460
now.
Hide and go seek.

951
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:23,250
Well that's a tougher one,
but it certainly exploration.

952
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,740
They're exploring the landscape,
right?

953
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,820
And they're matching wits against one
another,

954
00:49:26,821 --> 00:49:28,890
but then they're also trying to see if,
you know,

955
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,110
do people like you enough to actually
find you,

956
00:49:31,111 --> 00:49:35,040
which is a helpful thing to know if
you're four years old.

957
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:39,600
So anyways,
children past these games down across,

958
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:43,650
let's say across the centuries,
and maybe tag is one of those games that

959
00:49:43,651 --> 00:49:46,650
you wouldn't even have to pass down.
Children might just invented

960
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:50,370
spontaneously with every generation like
because you can more or less play tag

961
00:49:50,371 --> 00:49:52,040
with a dog,
you know,

962
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:56,230
I mean the dog doesn't quite get it but,
but,

963
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:58,790
but it's close.
Okay.

964
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:01,310
So.
So there are some games that are,

965
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:03,370
that are enjoyable and now so that
they're,

966
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,260
they're either transmitted and everyone
learns some very rapidly or they're,

967
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:10,230
they're so close to our nature that we
can reinvent them.

968
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:12,720
And Tag I think is the classic example
of that.

969
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:15,330
So.
So that's interesting too because what

970
00:50:15,331 --> 00:50:19,620
it means is that there are certain types
of competitive and cooperative behavior.

971
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,530
Those are elementary moral systems that
are.

972
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,170
They look like they're integral to our
nature.

973
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,090
Now.
You could even say they're built right

974
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:31,640
or you could say there are so close to
built in that it doesn't take much of a

975
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,670
introduction to the rules of the game
before.

976
00:50:34,671 --> 00:50:36,520
Everybody's pretty happy with it.
And you know,

977
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:40,160
you see this with a lot of things.
You play peekaboo with a baby.

978
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,350
Okay?
So what are the rules?

979
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:44,420
What are the rules of peekaboo?

980
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:47,923
What's that?

981
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:50,180
You Go,
you cover your eyes.

982
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:50,601
He.
Okay,

983
00:50:50,601 --> 00:50:52,460
so that's right.
So you go like this.

984
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,590
Okay.
Then what's the next rule?

985
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:58,340
That's right.
You reveal your eyes.

986
00:50:58,341 --> 00:51:02,360
You don't just sit there like this.
Now you know you can play a trick on her

987
00:51:02,361 --> 00:51:05,600
baby if you want.
And babies will laugh about this sort of

988
00:51:05,601 --> 00:51:06,440
thing,
which is really,

989
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:10,280
I think really quite amazing.
The baby's laugh is something remarkable

990
00:51:10,281 --> 00:51:13,070
to me.
So you can go like this and then like

991
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:15,230
this and then like this and then like
this.

992
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,160
And then you can do this new baby will
laugh because that's,

993
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:22,580
that's a little variation.
A or you can go like this,

994
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:26,680
right?
And then the baby,

995
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:31,600
while even that'll even make you guys
can see how deeply rooted this is.

996
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:34,980
So you know,
but eventually one of the baby do it.

997
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:36,360
They'll grab your hands,
right?

998
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,660
Pull them down because you're breaking
the dam rules.

999
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:42,040
Maybe knows the rules.
Even though you've never established any

1000
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:45,070
rules and you can get the rules going
with about five reps,

1001
00:51:45,071 --> 00:51:45,611
right?
You say,

1002
00:51:45,611 --> 00:51:48,430
okay,
this maybe no one's ever play peekaboo

1003
00:51:48,431 --> 00:51:50,830
with the baby and the baby figures it
out right away,

1004
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,030
this,
this,

1005
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,520
and then you're very that.
Maybe do that.

1006
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:58,660
That baby thinks that's a hell of a good
joke instead of down.

1007
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,290
And so it's variations within this rule
bound theme.

1008
00:52:02,291 --> 00:52:04,150
It's kind of like musical in the sense,
right?

1009
00:52:04,151 --> 00:52:07,420
It's variations within the theme.
Now what you don't do is go

1010
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:12,180
because the baby,
that was your shortage right now,

1011
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:15,140
so you don't do that unless you're,
you know,

1012
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,770
last year haven't evil streak.

1013
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,130
So there's certainly ways of violating
the baby's expectations and what the

1014
00:52:24,131 --> 00:52:26,200
baby will do.
If you do that as startle and they

1015
00:52:26,201 --> 00:52:30,520
started with their whole bodies and then
look at you and then probably they'll

1016
00:52:30,521 --> 00:52:33,250
burst into tears,
but some babies will just laugh,

1017
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:36,550
like mad if something like that happens.
And you can find those babies all over

1018
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:39,150
youtube.
You get the baby,

1019
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,090
the mother's sneezes and the baby has a
fit laughing for like 10 minutes,

1020
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:45,000
you know?
So it's quite interesting,

1021
00:52:45,001 --> 00:52:48,070
like one of the things about babies I've
never been able to understand is the

1022
00:52:48,071 --> 00:52:50,530
staggering sophistication of their
senses of humor,

1023
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:55,120
like and it's like it's deeper because
even a nine month old baby can play

1024
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:57,790
tricks on you.
So you know,

1025
00:52:57,791 --> 00:53:00,770
their baby tricks but still their tricks
and they laugh and you know,

1026
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:02,690
they're quite comical and they liked
variation.

1027
00:53:02,691 --> 00:53:04,360
So anyways,
the point is point.

1028
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:07,360
One of the points of all this is these,
these,

1029
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:10,870
this understanding of game like
structures is really,

1030
00:53:10,871 --> 00:53:11,740
really,
really,

1031
00:53:11,741 --> 00:53:12,580
really,
really,

1032
00:53:12,581 --> 00:53:17,080
really deep inside of us.
And it's way before articulation.

1033
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:18,363
You know,
Arctic,

1034
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:23,110
it's way before we can say the rules.
Babies can pick up the damn rules right

1035
00:53:23,111 --> 00:53:25,980
away and it's kind of a dance.
Some sense.

1036
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,550
And the dance is also a rule bound
structure.

1037
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:33,240
Like if you're dancing with someone,
well there's rules like don't step on

1038
00:53:33,241 --> 00:53:35,430
their feet,
but you also set up a set of

1039
00:53:35,431 --> 00:53:39,000
expectations in the dance and then you
violate them in tandem.

1040
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:41,190
And if you can do it gracefully then
it's fun.

1041
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:41,940
You know,
and,

1042
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,470
and maybe the person you're dancing
with,

1043
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:45,610
configuring out if you were an absolute
Klutz and you know,

1044
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:48,660
civil autistic that you can't even get
outside of yourself and might make a

1045
00:53:48,661 --> 00:53:52,230
half reasonable partner or if it's just
hopeless so,

1046
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:54,270
but the dance is the same thing.

1047
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:59,130
It's not negotiated verbally.
It's negotiated bodily and unless we

1048
00:53:59,131 --> 00:54:02,730
were able to imitate and imitate
insanely well because human beings can

1049
00:54:02,731 --> 00:54:05,250
imitate like mad,
we wouldn't be able to do that.

1050
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:08,520
And so babies are the same way.
You basically start,

1051
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:13,080
you don't actually.
Peekaboo doesn't have rules because a

1052
00:54:13,081 --> 00:54:16,500
rule is a stated description of a set of
expectations.

1053
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:20,490
What,
what peekaboo has his expectations and

1054
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:23,610
repetition and you can violate the
expectations,

1055
00:54:23,611 --> 00:54:26,640
but that doesn't mean you're breaking
the rule because the expectation is not

1056
00:54:26,641 --> 00:54:29,700
a rule.
It's not a rule until you observe the

1057
00:54:29,701 --> 00:54:32,910
expectation.
You describe what it is and maybe you

1058
00:54:32,911 --> 00:54:36,150
even write it down and you can play
games long before,

1059
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:40,620
long before you can follow rules.
And one of the things piaget observed is

1060
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:43,470
if you take kids,
if you watch a bunch of kids playing a

1061
00:54:43,471 --> 00:54:47,040
complicated game like marbles in,
they're like six and you take them out

1062
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:48,600
of the game and you ask them what the
rules are,

1063
00:54:48,601 --> 00:54:51,690
they can't tell you or they may be get
some of them right in a bunch of them

1064
00:54:51,691 --> 00:54:52,410
wrong.

1065
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:56,280
Maybe if you interviewed every child
that was playing and you looked at the

1066
00:54:56,281 --> 00:54:59,460
commonality of description,
you could extract out the underlying

1067
00:54:59,461 --> 00:55:02,880
rule structure of the game.
But the kids don't know the rules,

1068
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:06,750
what they know is how to play with other
kids when they're playing marbles.

1069
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,410
And a lot of that's,
you know,

1070
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:13,500
nonverbal Hanson eyebrow raises and no,
you can't do that and so forth.

1071
00:55:13,501 --> 00:55:16,050
And it isn't till much later that they
can tell you the rules if ever.

1072
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,540
So like,
you know,

1073
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:22,110
you guys can't tell me the rules for
dancing successful with someone.

1074
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:25,230
You can tell me some stupid things you
shouldn't do,

1075
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,930
but you imagine how complex it is.
It's very,

1076
00:55:27,931 --> 00:55:30,360
very difficult to articulate the whole
structure.

1077
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:32,460
But you can sure tell when it's
happening.

1078
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:36,240
And you can sure tell when you're not
doing it or maybe your partner isn't.

1079
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:39,630
So partly what that also means is you
know how to do things that you don't

1080
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:44,340
know how you know how to do and you know
how to do all sorts of things that you

1081
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,770
don't know how,
you know how to do in fact most of what

1082
00:55:46,771 --> 00:55:47,610
you notice like that.

1083
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:52,350
And so that also means that we can be
playing games that are extraordinarily

1084
00:55:52,351 --> 00:55:56,250
sophisticated and that maybe are rooted
way back in history that we don't

1085
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:59,190
understand.
But that doesn't mean that we can't

1086
00:55:59,191 --> 00:56:01,680
describe.
At least we don't have an articulated

1087
00:56:01,681 --> 00:56:04,290
knowledge of the structure,
but we could still play them.

1088
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:07,140
Now,
I don't know if you know this or not,

1089
00:56:07,141 --> 00:56:12,141
but you might know it
a while back 20 years ago

1090
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:18,740
about that,
those massive online multiplayer games

1091
00:56:18,741 --> 00:56:21,240
started to become popular.
And uh,

1092
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:24,910
you know,
some of them I think although I don't

1093
00:56:24,911 --> 00:56:26,950
know this for sure,
some of them lasted a long time and

1094
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:29,320
maybe some of them are still being
played like the early ones,

1095
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:32,050
you know.
So they developed entire worlds in

1096
00:56:32,051 --> 00:56:32,884
there.
And you know,

1097
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,070
um,
there was an economist who became quite

1098
00:56:36,071 --> 00:56:39,280
famous because of those games.
Castro Neva,

1099
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:42,760
I think his name was Edward Castronova,
I think that's right.

1100
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,070
But it's close.
Anyways,

1101
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:46,660
he tried,
he thought,

1102
00:56:46,661 --> 00:56:48,430
hey look man,
those are games,

1103
00:56:48,431 --> 00:56:51,590
those are countries.
And so one of the things he tried to do

1104
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:56,200
was to calculate their gross national
product and you know,

1105
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,210
you can trade items in those little
worlds,

1106
00:56:58,211 --> 00:56:59,044
right.
And you could,

1107
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,380
you could sell them on Ebay for example.
And for awhile in this one game and

1108
00:57:02,381 --> 00:57:05,710
maybe there's still happens,
there were young people in the

1109
00:57:05,711 --> 00:57:08,320
Philippines who are working inside these
games,

1110
00:57:08,321 --> 00:57:12,130
making artifacts that they were selling
on Ebay to other game players because

1111
00:57:12,131 --> 00:57:15,370
they could make more money doing that
than they could actually working in the

1112
00:57:15,371 --> 00:57:17,870
actual world.
Well,

1113
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,650
so Castronova I think what's his name
said?

1114
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,410
Well you don't get it.
That is the real world.

1115
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:26,440
Like that's not a game or if it's a
game,

1116
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:28,750
it's so much like the world that it's
part of the world.

1117
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:32,500
And so he calculated the gross national
product of some of these massive games

1118
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:35,440
and they were like,
the 30th richest country in the world

1119
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,500
was insane,
you know,

1120
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:42,510
and so that's interesting because that
also shows you that the line between a

1121
00:57:42,701 --> 00:57:47,701
game and reality is not clear.
So here's another example of that.

1122
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:50,550
It's something we're thinking about.
Um,

1123
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:55,810
some of you have no doubt played very
complex multiplayer online games and I

1124
00:57:55,811 --> 00:57:59,260
suppose those more often those are
adventure games or quest games and you

1125
00:57:59,261 --> 00:58:02,680
have to communicate with other people
and you have to solve problems and you

1126
00:58:02,681 --> 00:58:03,520
have to,
you know,

1127
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:07,180
maybe you have to defend yourselves.
It's like you're an exploratory party in

1128
00:58:07,181 --> 00:58:08,650
a new world,
something like that.

1129
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:11,860
And so it's pretty sophisticated now.
Okay.

1130
00:58:11,861 --> 00:58:15,400
And some of you have worked at
Mcdonald's or another fast food

1131
00:58:15,401 --> 00:58:16,930
restaurant.
How many of you have worked at a

1132
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:17,764
restaurant?

1133
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,110
Okay.
How many at a fast food restaurant?

1134
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,920
Okay.
Would you say that an online game is

1135
00:58:23,921 --> 00:58:28,150
more like the world or less like the
world then your job at a fast food

1136
00:58:28,151 --> 00:58:31,360
restaurant or more?
It's more.

1137
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:34,690
Can anybody disagree?
Okay.

1138
00:58:34,691 --> 00:58:39,691
Why is it more like the real world
complex stuff,

1139
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,080
but what are you doing?
You're exploring,

1140
00:58:44,081 --> 00:58:46,420
you're thinking,
you're getting out of situations.

1141
00:58:46,421 --> 00:58:48,790
You always,
every new situations coming up and

1142
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:51,410
you're dealing with them and you're
learning a fast food,

1143
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,290
right?
You're a real car.

1144
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:55,840
Get fast food and the sheet,
right?

1145
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,760
Yeah,
but it's in the real world.

1146
00:58:57,761 --> 00:59:00,030
Is it a gate and more like a machine.
Right,

1147
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:00,790
right,
right,

1148
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:01,623
right.
So,

1149
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:06,460
so does that mean that McDonald's is
less real than a multiplayer online

1150
00:59:06,461 --> 00:59:07,294
game?

1151
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,470
Well,
it's a tough one a because when you're

1152
00:59:11,471 --> 00:59:14,020
trying to think about what real means
is,

1153
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:16,300
you might think maybe I phrased that
wrongly,

1154
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:21,340
I maybe I could say,
is Mcdonald's a worst model of the real

1155
00:59:21,831 --> 00:59:26,831
world than a multiplayer online game?
And it's too hard because it's hard to

1156
00:59:26,991 --> 00:59:31,430
say that dogs is part of the real world.
So like a priority to claim is kind of

1157
00:59:31,431 --> 00:59:32,450
absurd.
It's like,

1158
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:34,610
well,
you're in a building.

1159
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,770
People actually come there,
they give you money,

1160
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:40,370
it's real.
But then when all you think about these

1161
00:59:40,371 --> 00:59:42,080
complex games and you think,
well,

1162
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:45,710
you're practicing and extraordinarily
sophisticated forms of social and

1163
00:59:45,711 --> 00:59:48,860
intellectual behavior and we actually
don't know what that does to people.

1164
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:51,740
Maybe it makes them extraordinarily
sophisticated than social.

1165
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,440
I do think that it helps with introverts
quite a lot,

1166
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:56,360
you know,
cause the introverts,

1167
00:59:56,630 --> 01:00:00,080
it's harder for introverts to become
extremely socially fluid because people

1168
01:00:00,081 --> 01:00:00,914
were the mount.

1169
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:05,300
But a lot of introverts do a lot of
heavy duty socializing on the net.

1170
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:07,190
And my experience has been that it's,
you know,

1171
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:10,610
all things considered,
it's probably a plus rather than a

1172
01:00:10,611 --> 01:00:12,220
minus.
Um,

1173
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,850
with regards to your,
your use of computational devices

1174
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:18,170
because you grew up,
grew up with them.

1175
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:22,100
One of the things I used to see my kids
doing is they would sit together in the

1176
01:00:22,101 --> 01:00:24,950
group,
they were teenagers and there'd be a

1177
01:00:24,951 --> 01:00:28,700
bunch of their friends that were there
and while they were interacting with all

1178
01:00:28,701 --> 01:00:30,980
their friends who were there,
they are also interacting with all their

1179
01:00:30,981 --> 01:00:34,520
friends who weren't there.
Is that a common thing for teenagers to

1180
01:00:34,521 --> 01:00:35,660
do?
Tech state.

1181
01:00:35,661 --> 01:00:37,730
You're texting your friends that aren't
there and so forth.

1182
01:00:37,731 --> 01:00:41,270
Is that reasonably standard behavior?
How many of you have done that?

1183
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:42,890
Okay.
How many?

1184
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:45,200
How many have you done that regularity?
Okay.

1185
01:00:45,201 --> 01:00:47,600
How many of you haven't done that?
Okay.

1186
01:00:47,601 --> 01:00:49,040
Okay.
So most people have done it,

1187
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:49,874
but no one.
Everyone.

1188
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:54,170
For those of you who have done it,
is that more advanced or less advanced

1189
01:00:54,171 --> 01:00:56,750
social behavior.
Okay.

1190
01:00:56,751 --> 01:00:57,890
You think more?
Why?

1191
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:03,050
Because I'm like you're keeping your
friends while they're not there.

1192
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,150
Okay.
Have a conceptual idea of like what

1193
01:01:06,151 --> 01:01:11,151
you're doing and like
understand where the dynamics are moving

1194
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:16,230
without them actually having to be
there.

1195
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:19,100
Okay.
Do you think that you paid a price for

1196
01:01:19,101 --> 01:01:23,210
it in the decrease of the intensity of
the social interactions you were having

1197
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:26,390
with the people who were actually there?
You don't think so.

1198
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,890
You think,
okay,

1199
01:01:27,891 --> 01:01:30,140
how many people think they do pay a
price for it?

1200
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,240
Okay.
How many people think they didn't?

1201
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:34,011
Okay.
Okay.

1202
01:01:34,011 --> 01:01:35,000
So.
Okay,

1203
01:01:35,001 --> 01:01:36,770
so,
well let's start with you guys then

1204
01:01:36,771 --> 01:01:38,840
because you're in a minority.
So why,

1205
01:01:38,841 --> 01:01:41,040
why do you think you didn't pay a price
for it?

1206
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:46,940
Oh,
okay.

1207
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:52,380
Well,
I think that can pay a price,

1208
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:56,560
but if you're doing it correctly then
you're monitoring the conversation that

1209
01:01:56,561 --> 01:01:59,080
you're currently taking part of,
you know,

1210
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:03,820
when it would be appropriate to your
phone and text someone else,

1211
01:02:03,821 --> 01:02:07,810
which actually meaningful probably
paying more attention to the people

1212
01:02:07,811 --> 01:02:10,590
you're talking about because you know,
you're also having to monitor.

1213
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:13,150
Okay.
So that's your kind of taken a

1214
01:02:13,151 --> 01:02:16,660
multitasking
rationale for it.

1215
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,940
Some sense.
Although assuming also that you have to

1216
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,510
your attention to manage that is there
as people who,

1217
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:24,370
who didn't think that it was,
that you did pay a price for who?

1218
01:02:24,371 --> 01:02:26,100
Who thought that?
Okay.

1219
01:02:26,101 --> 01:02:26,940
What sort of price?

1220
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:32,430
I think that especially with text
gets lost,

1221
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,860
convey your feelings.
Like there's so much more to.

1222
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:39,910
Okay.
So they certainly lose something.

1223
01:02:39,911 --> 01:02:43,030
What about you while you're interacting
with like your,

1224
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:45,280
your,
your actual president,

1225
01:02:45,281 --> 01:02:45,980
France.

1226
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:50,150
I would say you have to commit to some
certain amount of effort to,

1227
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:51,370
you know,
writing the textbook,

1228
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:54,050
ignore like aspects of.
So for example,

1229
01:02:54,051 --> 01:02:58,370
if they're talking about something
and then you texted them when you come

1230
01:02:58,371 --> 01:03:00,650
back and miss like some.

1231
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:01,663
Yeah.
So,

1232
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:03,580
so it stopped.
Started stopped,

1233
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:06,850
started.
I don't think you can commit yourself.

1234
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,820
One of the things you've suggested was
that some of that can be mitigated by

1235
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:13,430
doing it properly,
which which implies that there's an

1236
01:03:13,431 --> 01:03:18,431
emergent norm norm for doing this sort
of thing and that if you're good at

1237
01:03:18,921 --> 01:03:22,040
complying with the norm,
then you're not going to be irritating

1238
01:03:22,041 --> 01:03:23,940
people and maybe you can handle things
at once.

1239
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:24,793
Something like that

1240
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:31,130
to the people that are in there that's
waiting for you to answer.

1241
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:34,180
Well,
I guess one answer to that would be

1242
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:37,310
that's up to them to determine like if
they don't want a big part of it,

1243
01:03:37,311 --> 01:03:40,790
then they could go do something else and
the reason I'm saying that specifically

1244
01:03:40,791 --> 01:03:43,580
is because you can imagine that that's
how the norm develops.

1245
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:49,180
It's like obviously if a successful norm
is going to develop that allows for text

1246
01:03:49,401 --> 01:03:52,130
conversation and real world
conversation,

1247
01:03:52,131 --> 01:03:56,660
do current the same time everybody has
to want it to happen and so that means

1248
01:03:56,661 --> 01:03:59,810
that you can't do it in the manner that
everyone wants.

1249
01:03:59,811 --> 01:04:01,460
It's going to die out.
Now,

1250
01:04:01,461 --> 01:04:03,280
see,
that's another example of,

1251
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:06,410
of the sea.
That's another example of how you can

1252
01:04:06,411 --> 01:04:09,950
start thinking about how moral
structures might I think evolve is the

1253
01:04:09,951 --> 01:04:13,760
right way of thinking about them because
I think moral structure has evolved and

1254
01:04:13,761 --> 01:04:17,180
I think they're just as real as anything
else that evolves.

1255
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,390
Now evolved things can be staggeringly
complex,

1256
01:04:20,391 --> 01:04:21,980
right?
I mean just think about how many life

1257
01:04:21,981 --> 01:04:25,940
forms there are and how many different
niches there are for those life forms

1258
01:04:26,180 --> 01:04:28,700
and so you have in some sense an
infinite variety,

1259
01:04:28,701 --> 01:04:31,850
but it's not infinite and it follows
patterns.

1260
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:35,840
Not just any old thing can be alive and
not just any old thing can be social.

1261
01:04:35,841 --> 01:04:40,841
So here's an example.
I found this out a while back.

1262
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:48,160
I did a lot of neuro biological
research.

1263
01:04:48,771 --> 01:04:51,410
Some of it hands on,
lot of conceptual,

1264
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:56,990
especially in the early days of my
graduate work and I got really

1265
01:04:56,991 --> 01:04:59,300
interested in the function of Serotonin
and you know,

1266
01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:02,900
you all know undoubtedly that one of the
things that antidepressants do is

1267
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:06,230
decrease the rate at which Serotonin is
pulled back up into the neurons that

1268
01:05:06,231 --> 01:05:08,570
deliver it.
And that seems to help stabilize

1269
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,770
people's negative emotion.

1270
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:12,050
Makes them less full of tile,
less anxious,

1271
01:05:12,051 --> 01:05:13,330
less likely to withdraw,
and so,

1272
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,070
or you could say it makes them more
confident.

1273
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,340
Now we also know that if you look,
say at a chimp hierarchy,

1274
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,100
um,
if you take bottom chimp and you give

1275
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:27,340
him antidepressants,
then he starts acting more like talk

1276
01:05:27,341 --> 01:05:29,710
chimp.
So because the bottom champ,

1277
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:32,230
the bottom chimps world is a very
dangerous place.

1278
01:05:32,231 --> 01:05:34,750
It's very uncertain.
He doesn't have a very good place to

1279
01:05:34,751 --> 01:05:36,700
sleep.
He doesn't have high quality mates,

1280
01:05:36,701 --> 01:05:39,010
he doesn't have good things to eat.
He stressed man,

1281
01:05:39,011 --> 01:05:41,560
it's bad down there.
And so maybe that's part of the reason

1282
01:05:41,561 --> 01:05:45,490
his nervous system is tuned so that he's
more anxious and upset by everything

1283
01:05:45,491 --> 01:05:47,380
because everything actually is more
dangerous.

1284
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,290
Part of that's modulated by Serotonin.
Okay?

1285
01:05:50,291 --> 01:05:54,790
So here's a rough rule.
If there's a hierarchy in an animal

1286
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:58,820
kingdom at,
as you move up the hierarchy,

1287
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:02,380
your serotonin levels increase and as
you move down the hierarchy or serotonin

1288
01:06:02,381 --> 01:06:07,000
levels decrease and that's somewhat
independent of your absolute wealth.

1289
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,990
So here's the famous experiments called
the Whitehall experiment,

1290
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:14,890
and it was done on English bureaucrats.
And the thing that's so cool about the

1291
01:06:14,891 --> 01:06:17,470
white doll experiments as they were done
50 years apart,

1292
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:22,000
and so what they showed basically was so
imagine you take a English bureaucracy

1293
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:27,100
and you stratify it by position,
you know Englishman or hierarchical and

1294
01:06:27,101 --> 01:06:30,730
so you stratified by position,
you have the top people in the bottom

1295
01:06:30,731 --> 01:06:33,760
people,
and then you look at the death rates and

1296
01:06:33,761 --> 01:06:37,930
what you find is the bottom people die
faster and more often now you might say,

1297
01:06:37,931 --> 01:06:40,150
well that's partly because if you're not
that healthy,

1298
01:06:40,151 --> 01:06:44,230
you end up at the bottom fair enough.
But there seems to be an effect over and

1299
01:06:44,231 --> 01:06:48,370
above the effect of just general health.
It's worse to be at the bottom that at

1300
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:49,870
the top.
Okay.

1301
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:55,020
That was true 70 years ago and then the
study was done again 50 years after

1302
01:06:55,061 --> 01:06:55,780
that.

1303
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:58,480
Now the thing that's so cool,
it's been by that time,

1304
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:02,500
from a material perspective,
the people who are at the bottom of the

1305
01:07:02,501 --> 01:07:05,860
modern hierarchy,
we're at least as wealthy roughly

1306
01:07:05,861 --> 01:07:09,670
speaking as the people who are like two
thirds of the way up 50 years before.

1307
01:07:09,671 --> 01:07:12,100
Right?
Because you know everybody had running

1308
01:07:12,101 --> 01:07:13,960
water.
That's a good thing.

1309
01:07:13,961 --> 01:07:15,790
Everyone,
everyone,

1310
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:18,250
everyone had enough heat for the winter,
you know,

1311
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,580
everyone had shelter and so on,
so you know when you figure with regards

1312
01:07:21,581 --> 01:07:22,414
to,
well,

1313
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:27,280
once you've got running water,
reliable shelter,

1314
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:32,230
heat and maybe air conditioning.
If you live in the desert and you're not

1315
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:34,750
hungry,
it's like you've got 90 percent of what

1316
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:36,970
wealth can deliver.
Oh really?

1317
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:41,170
All things considered.
The rest of it is status and luxury

1318
01:07:41,171 --> 01:07:42,980
items,
but this,

1319
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:47,920
the relationship between positional
status and death rates remain constant,

1320
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:52,930
so that's.
That's very interesting and we know that

1321
01:07:52,931 --> 01:07:55,300
that's true from a lot of other studies
as well.

1322
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:59,920
It's like control for absolute wealth.
There's still a problem with hierarchy

1323
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:02,860
and that seems mediated,
at least in part by Serotonin and

1324
01:08:02,861 --> 01:08:06,490
serotonin regulates negative emotion and
the more negative emotion that you

1325
01:08:06,491 --> 01:08:08,200
experienced,
the more cortisol you produce.

1326
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:12,160
Cortisol and high levels is toxic and it
suppresses your immune system so your

1327
01:08:12,161 --> 01:08:16,220
brain gets damaged and you.
You gain weight and you get diabetes and

1328
01:08:16,221 --> 01:08:19,100
maybe develop Alzheimer's disease and
you're more prone to cancer and heart

1329
01:08:19,101 --> 01:08:20,180
disease.
And all of those things,

1330
01:08:20,181 --> 01:08:25,181
and so that's just not so good now that
that serotonergic mechanism is really

1331
01:08:26,301 --> 01:08:31,301
old and so
you can give Serotonin,

1332
01:08:31,631 --> 01:08:36,631
new Jack injections to unhappy lobsters
and cheers them right up at least

1333
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:38,770
behaviorally speaking.
If they're defeated in a fight and you

1334
01:08:38,771 --> 01:08:42,040
give them a serotonin dejection,
they'll stand up tall,

1335
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:43,690
confident,
and they'll fight again.

1336
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:47,020
Now the reason I'm telling you that for
a very specific reason,

1337
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:51,280
because one of the things we've been
asking about as well,

1338
01:08:51,490 --> 01:08:54,430
how might you conceptualize moral
systems and then how might you

1339
01:08:54,431 --> 01:08:59,431
conceptualize their evolution.
And one of the propositions was there

1340
01:09:00,071 --> 01:09:03,460
are playable games and non playable
gates.

1341
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,710
Well,
here's a playable game dominance

1342
01:09:05,711 --> 01:09:06,544
hierarchy.

1343
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:10,340
We've been playing it for $400,
million years.

1344
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:13,210
It's stable now.
It's,

1345
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:15,980
it's,
it's so unstable that even lobsters have

1346
01:09:15,981 --> 01:09:17,450
them,
but even worse,

1347
01:09:17,451 --> 01:09:22,451
it's so stable that the biochemical
systems that the lobsters used to act

1348
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:26,210
within the dominance hierarchy and react
to.

1349
01:09:26,211 --> 01:09:31,211
It's the same as it is in us.
And so not only is that stable,

1350
01:09:31,371 --> 01:09:32,204
it's,
it's,

1351
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:36,260
well,
it's ridiculously stable.

1352
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:37,970
So one of the things we could say is,
well,

1353
01:09:37,971 --> 01:09:42,971
one of the games that seems emergent and
real is a dominance heart.

1354
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:47,990
Well then we might ask,
well what exactly constitutes a

1355
01:09:47,991 --> 01:09:49,880
dominance hierarchy?
And then we might also ask,

1356
01:09:49,881 --> 01:09:51,650
well,
what constitutes a highly functional

1357
01:09:51,651 --> 01:09:55,250
dominance hierarchy versus a
dysfunctional dominance hierarchy and

1358
01:09:55,251 --> 01:09:59,510
even what does highly functional versus
dysfunctional meet while we have to

1359
01:09:59,511 --> 01:10:02,420
define all those terms,
but we will as we move forward.

1360
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:05,470
But you see the point I'm making is that
there,

1361
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:08,630
and this is a bit of a contradiction
with the initial statement,

1362
01:10:08,631 --> 01:10:13,631
I need that there is a tight distinction
between the scientific world in the

1363
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:18,910
objective world because I'm also talking
about the evolution of games and you

1364
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:20,300
know,
evolution,

1365
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:25,400
the study of evolution is obviously a
scientific study and the dominance

1366
01:10:25,401 --> 01:10:29,030
hierarchies a biological phenomena,
but in some sense it's also a game and

1367
01:10:29,031 --> 01:10:30,260
it's also a moral structure.

1368
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:33,590
So there are levels of analysis where
these things start to get tangled

1369
01:10:33,591 --> 01:10:35,900
together and that's partly what we're
going to try to sort out.

1370
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:37,880
So,
um,

1371
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,430
we'll do that in the future because it's
very,

1372
01:10:41,431 --> 01:10:42,300
very complicated.

1373
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:45,543
Alright,

1374
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,320
now we're going to step back a little
bit.

1375
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:53,280
Fact,
we're going to take a break.
