1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,260
Hi Guys,
girls and interested others.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,110
I thought I'd give you an update on the 
week's events.

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,200
I've still been involved in discussions 
with the dean of the Faculty of Arts and

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,710
Sciences,
David Cameron on the upcoming debate.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,410
And so I thought I'd fill you in on all 
of the events,

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,280
but first of all,
I want to make a slight detour.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,760
So one of the things that's happened to 
me since I put my lectures on youtube is

8
00:00:29,941 --> 00:00:34,941
that I frequently come across people 
claiming that high sound a fair bit like

9
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:38,490
kermit the frog.
Kermit the frog here.

10
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,030
Hi.
Oh,

11
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:48,030
kermit the frog here.
Hi.

12
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:51,480
All kermit the frog here.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,033
And uh,
I wasn't really sure what to make of 

14
00:00:55,361 --> 00:00:56,194
that.
It might not have been my first choice 

15
00:00:58,301 --> 00:00:59,134
for animal Avatar,
although I suppose it could be a lot 

16
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:01,841
worse.
I need.

17
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:02,674
Kermit is a pretty good guy and he's a 
decent spokes frog and a and a good 

18
00:01:07,421 --> 00:01:09,130
organizer and,
and all of that.

19
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:11,080
So.
But anyways,

20
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:12,923
I was thinking about that this morning 
and I realized something and I think 

21
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:19,240
it's an example of what the psychologist
Carl Jung called synchronicity.

22
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,223
Synchronicity.
The simultaneous occurrence of events 

23
00:01:23,261 --> 00:01:25,990
that appear significantly or 
meaningfully related,

24
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,570
but have no discernible causal 
connection.

25
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,440
And since I've been engaging in this 
free speech campaign,

26
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,140
I have experienced a number of 
synchronous event.

27
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:35,974
So one of them was that when the 
Canadian Union of Public Employee Queer 

28
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,163
Caucus was sent,
the University of letter denouncing me 

29
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,960
essentially at exactly the same moment 
that letter was released.

30
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:47,794
I had another Canadian Union of Public 
Employees President in my office who 

31
00:01:51,731 --> 00:01:52,564
was,
who is a representative of one of the 

32
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:54,604
major groups on campus who was talking 
to me about his concerns about the new 

33
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,010
university sexual harassment policy,
which has been formulated in response to

34
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:03,844
the demands of Kathleen winds,
Ontario government that threatens to 

35
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:07,924
make normal,
let's call the misunderstanding social 

36
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:12,790
misunderstandings perhaps of a sexual 
nature,

37
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,210
all equivalent to rape,
um,

38
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,230
and,
and to sexual violence.

39
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,063
And this qp organization president was 
telling me about his concerns that 

40
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:25,120
that's going to put tremendous stress on
the interactions between the people that

41
00:02:25,121 --> 00:02:26,560
he had.
He has to represent.

42
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:28,480
So that was an interesting 
juxtaposition.

43
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,433
He couldn't find anybody in the 
University of Admin administration to 

44
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:34,720
properly address his concerns.
But then the frog issue.

45
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,070
Well,
here's something cool,

46
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,070
so you'll notice these sculptures behind
me,

47
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:43,330
they're made by an artist,
a native artist named Charles Joseph,

48
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:46,330
and Charles Joseph is a friend and now a
brother of mine,

49
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,613
um,
as I've been inducted into their tribal 

50
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,000
group,
which happened by say,

51
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,163
by the way,
the same week that I was being accused 

52
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:57,430
of being racist by many people on the 
University of Toronto campus.

53
00:02:57,431 --> 00:03:00,490
So that was another major active as far 
as I was concerned.

54
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:01,324
But one thing that's kind of cool is 
that I had this mask made by Charles 

55
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,720
Awhile back.
And this is a frog.

56
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,490
So there they are.
Now.

57
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,370
I've got my,
my Kwakwaka'wakw,

58
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,580
the Kwakwaka'wakw people are tribal 
people who live in,

59
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:17,843
in,
uh,

60
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,853
on the west coast of Vancouver Island.
And they have a remarkable artistic 

61
00:03:21,981 --> 00:03:23,650
tradition,
which I've been very interested in.

62
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:26,060
And I've had a lot of work done by 
Charles who,

63
00:03:26,061 --> 00:03:26,894
as I said,
as a residential school survivor and he 

64
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:31,670
made this beautiful frog hap for me.
And so,

65
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,563
and here's something cool too.
So I asked Charles about the 

66
00:03:35,121 --> 00:03:37,790
significance of the frog and 
Kwakwaka'wakw mythology,

67
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:41,000
and he said the frog is a harbinger of 
dangerous,

68
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,350
a dangerous times because if anything 
pollutes the waters,

69
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,130
then the frogs disappear.
And of course that did happen almost all

70
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:51,800
around the world a few years ago because
the frogs,

71
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,660
frogs have very sensitive skin and so 
they pick up anything that,

72
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:55,923
that,
that has gone wrong and it interferes 

73
00:03:57,051 --> 00:03:59,720
with their ability to reproduce and to 
live.

74
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,063
And so I would say that as spokes frog,
I'm announcing that there's something 

75
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:05,564
polluted,
devote the water in which we're all 

76
00:04:06,471 --> 00:04:09,500
swimming in,
that we better clean it up and,

77
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,450
or there's going to be trouble.
So,

78
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,150
um,
there's a bit of synchronicity for you.

79
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,133
So what I've been doing this week,
because working out the details of the 

80
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:19,570
debate with,
uh,

81
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,970
with the dean of the Faculty of Arts and
Science,

82
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,260
David Cameron.

83
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,290
And uh,
I met him Monday,

84
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:33,370
November first in the meeting.
He threw a curve ball at me,

85
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,690
I would say.
Um,

86
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,140
he said that if the debate was going to 
go forward,

87
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,850
the university couldn't allow it to go 
forward.

88
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:40,684
If I was going to repeat my assertion 
that I would not use gender neutral 

89
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:47,050
pronouns to refer to people if they 
asked me to do so.

90
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,943
And you may know that the university has
already sent me two warning letters 

91
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,280
telling me that,
um,

92
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,380
my refusal to use these pronouns is in 
violation of university policy.

93
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,123
We'll get to that in a while.
And also contravenes the Ontario Human 

94
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,563
Rights Code.
And,

95
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,853
and also that as my employer,
the university is as responsible for my 

96
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,823
speech acts as I am.
And of course I did know that because 

97
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,160
that's exactly why I made the videos to 
begin with.

98
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:20,680
And that's exactly what I said in the 
videos.

99
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,960
And so the university is distancing 
itself from me because they know that if

100
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:30,100
I get called for my hate speech because 
of my refusal to use these pronouns,

101
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:32,530
than the university is just as guilty as
I am.

102
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:33,364
So what they're doing is setting up a 
series of legal documents that are 

103
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:39,160
designed to show that they acted in good
faith,

104
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,510
trying to discipline a wayward employee 
who is contravening these policies.

105
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:44,883
And David implied quite strongly.
I would say that with each of those 

106
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:48,904
assertions,
the probability that I will be able to 

107
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:51,754
teach at the University of Toronto come 
2017 when I started my undergraduate 

108
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,820
teaching is diminishing.
And so I knew that,

109
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,703
but it was still a sharp to hear it.
And then of course that put me in a 

110
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,013
conundrum because I wasn't sure if it 
was reasonable for me to proceed with 

111
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:09,140
the debate if a risk because it's a 
debate about free speech.

112
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:14,140
Say if a arbitrary restriction was 
placed on what I was able to say.

113
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,363
And so initially I thought,
well that I could proceed with the 

114
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:19,214
debate because I really want to talk 
about bill [inaudible] and issues that 

115
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:26,630
our larger scale than my mirror refusal 
to use these pronouns.

116
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,943
But then I went home and I really 
thought about it and I talked with my 

117
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:30,674
family because we thought it was 
perverse in some sense that in this 

118
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:35,654
debate the debate would begin with a 
significant restriction on what I was 

119
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,420
allowed to say.
So I wrote a letter,

120
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,950
which I'm,
which I'm going to read to you.

121
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,420
I wrote this on on Tuesday,
November second,

122
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:50,750
and I sent it to American Gertler,
who's the president of the University of

123
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,130
Toronto show band,
Nelson,

124
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,230
Dean,
Faculty of Arts and science,

125
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:55,064
the vice provost who was a signatory of 
the second letter I received from the 

126
00:06:58,401 --> 00:06:59,234
university,
the one asking me not to repeat my 

127
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:01,814
assertions anymore,
asking me to silence myself to Cheryl 

128
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,123
[inaudible],
who's the vice president and provost to 

129
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:08,900
Kelly Hannah Moffat,
vice president,

130
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:10,280
human resources and equity.

131
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,323
A Hannah Moffitt is still working with 
the black liberation collective by the 

132
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:15,794
way,
despite the fact that on their website 

133
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,410
they basically,
they refuse to disavow violence in their

134
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,300
pursuit of social change.
And also,

135
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,183
um,
were started and continued to be 

136
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,140
strongly influenced by two people have,
let's say,

137
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:30,974
dubious reputation.
You can read about them online if you 

138
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:35,090
want,
and also Suzanne Ferber,

139
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,010
who's the chair of the Department of 
Psychology,

140
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:39,650
who gave me the first of the two warning
letters.

141
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:40,484
So what the university is doing is 
setting themselves up so that if I'm 

142
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:45,890
taken to court and they're taking the 
court along with me,

143
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,300
then they can claim that they've done 
everything they possibly can to reign in

144
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:51,111
this,
you know,

145
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:51,944
this abusive professor who refuses to 
let other people determine the words 

146
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:57,620
that he says.
And uh,

147
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,670
so this is the letter I wrote,
Dear Dean Cameron yesterday.

148
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,953
You indicated that if the debate where 
to proceed and if I repeated my 

149
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:10,070
insistence that I would not use gender 
neutral pronouns during that debate,

150
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,760
the university would find itself in an 
untenable legal position.

151
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,343
This is because number one use of those 
pronouns is mandated by university 

152
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:20,594
policy and the Ontario Human Rights Act 
and its surrounding policies as laid 

153
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:25,131
out,
for example,

154
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:28,370
on the Ontario Human Rights Commission 
website and two,

155
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,443
under those laws and policies,
employers are responsible for the 

156
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:35,930
statements of their employees as if they
were making the statements themselves.

157
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,740
Thus,
if the university hosts this debate,

158
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:40,783
providing me with a platform for my 
views and I restated my intention to 

159
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:45,344
refuse use of the mandated pronouns and 
legal action and sued the university 

160
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:50,684
would not have properly upheld its legal
obligation to ensure that its employees 

161
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:59,231
follow the requisite laws.
You also indicated that if I continue to

162
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:02,730
insist publicly that I will not use the 
mandated pronouns.

163
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,230
The university may also be required to 
suspend my courses beginning in January.

164
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,353
You suggested therefore that I agree 
during the debate not to repeat my 

165
00:09:13,321 --> 00:09:14,154
refusal to use gender neutral pronouns,
so as not to further compromise the 

166
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,860
university and to allow the debate to go
forward.

167
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,700
I sat at our meeting that I would 
consider this and I have.

168
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,523
I cannot abide by this request.
Part of the discussion that needs to be 

169
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:35,321
had during it outside of the debate is 
precisely what the university should do.

170
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,950
Because of my refusal.

171
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,810
Here are the options.
Number one,

172
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:46,120
the university can consist,
continue to insist upon my silence based

173
00:09:46,121 --> 00:09:48,910
on its understanding that my actions are
currently legal.

174
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,563
Sorry.
Based on its understanding that my 

175
00:09:51,881 --> 00:09:55,930
actions are currently illegal
on its concern,

176
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,793
a bit refusing to use gender neutral 
pronouns is illegal and more precisely 

177
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,120
be that my statement that I would refuse
to use them if asked is also illegal.

178
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,770
It can then take continue to take 
whatever actions that deems necessary to

179
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:16,720
distance itself from me and my opinions.
Option two,

180
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,533
the university can reaffirm its 
commitment to its statement on freedom 

181
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:26,570
of speech written in May 19,
92,

182
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,823
which explicitly states that quote,
the essential purpose of the university 

183
00:10:31,191 --> 00:10:34,550
is to engage in the pursuit of truth,
the advancement of learning,

184
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,050
and the dissemination of knowledge.
To achieve this purpose,

185
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,183
all members of the university must have 
as a prerequisite freedom of speech and 

186
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:44,114
expression,
which means the right to examine 

187
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,200
question,
investigate,

188
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,243
speculate,
and comment on any issue without 

189
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:56,890
reference to prescribe doctrine as well 
as the right to criticize the university

190
00:10:56,891 --> 00:10:57,724
and society at large.
The existence of an institution were 

191
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:06,410
unorthodox ideas.
Alternative modes of thinking and living

192
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,530
and radical prescriptions for social 
ills can be debated,

193
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,140
contributes immensely to social and 
political change,

194
00:11:12,141 --> 00:11:15,830
and the advancement of human rights both
inside and outside the university.

195
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,893
Often this debate may generate 
controversy and disputes among members 

196
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,610
of the university and the wider 
community.

197
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,253
In such cases,
the universities primary obligation is 

198
00:11:27,681 --> 00:11:29,900
to protect the free speech of all 
involved.

199
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,500
The university must allow the fullest 
range of debate.

200
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,090
It should not limit that debate by 
preordained and conclusions or punishing

201
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,510
or inhibiting the reasonable exercise of
free speech.

202
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,700
And I said the university must decide it
can express option one,

203
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,713
which in my opinion means sacrificing 
it's commitment to free speech as 

204
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:54,544
expressly laid out in the aforementioned
statement or it can accept option to 

205
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,483
defending my right to quote,
criticize the university and society at 

206
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:07,480
large and quote by all legal means 
necessary.

207
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:08,763
This would mean throwing it support 
behind me and fighting the restrictive 

208
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:17,410
legislation on embodied in the Ontario 
Human Rights Act and associated policies

209
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,870
and soon to be instantiated in federal 
bill.

210
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:24,760
See 16 all the way to the Supreme Court 
of Canada if necessary.

211
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,120
I understand that the statement also 
says that quote,

212
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:31,983
the purpose of the university also 
depends on an environment of tolerance 

213
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:37,900
and mutual respect.
Every member should be able to work,

214
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:38,560
live,
teach,

215
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,393
and learn in university,
free from discrimination and harassment 

216
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,943
and quote,
my actions have been deemed by some to 

217
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,124
constitute discrimination.
So the two major principles outlined in 

218
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:52,474
the statement or now in conflict and the
university and our society at large has 

219
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:02,830
to decide which one takes priority.
As Professor Jonathan Haidt,

220
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,693
professor of ethical leadership at Nyu 
Stern School of business recently 

221
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,744
indicated in the US universities must 
choose one t loss that's guiding 

222
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,160
principle,
social justice

223
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,683
or truth.
I have similarly juxtapose social 

224
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:26,410
justice and freedom of expression and 
chose the latter.

225
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,180
Make your decision.
I've made mine.

226
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,410
May God himself help us live with the 
consequences.

227
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,440
Now,
Jonathan Haidt.

228
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,510
I'm going to read you a little bit about
what he wrote.

229
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,960
He wrote this last week and all.
All set.

230
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,050
Yup.
All set up the link and the video in the

231
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:51,820
comments on this video so you can look 
at it.

232
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,133
Jonathan Haidt,
who's very good political psychologist 

233
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:55,654
by the way,
says no university can have truth and 

234
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:03,040
social justice as dual t locis final 
goals.

235
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,680
John Stuart Mill is the patron saint of 
what all call Truth University,

236
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,753
which sees truth as a process in which 
flawed individuals challenge each 

237
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:17,881
other's biased and incomplete reasoning 
in the process all become smarter

238
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,583
truth you dies when it becomes 
intellectual uniform or politically 

239
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,064
orthodox.
Karl Marx is the patron saint of social 

240
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:28,894
justice,
you which is oriented around changing 

241
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:34,990
the world in part by overthrowing power 
structures and privilege.

242
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,560
It sees political diversity as an 
obstacle to action.

243
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,660
Each university must pick one.
Alright,

244
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,540
so now David Cameron,
the Dean,

245
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,360
wrote me back.
That's the same day,

246
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,403
which is what I requested and he said,
I have reviewed your letter dated 

247
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:56,120
November second,
2016.

248
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,540
I do not agree with the way that you 
have framed our conversation,

249
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,583
which was a good faith attempt to find a
way to identify a terms of reference 

250
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:04,184
that would allow for you as an academic 
to engage in a discussion about your 

251
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:08,354
views regarding the provisions of the 
Ontario Human Rights Code that it 

252
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:14,660
protected against discrimination based 
on gender identity and gender expression

253
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:15,494
since 2012.
That's the similar legislation in 

254
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:22,010
Ontario as well as similar amendments 
that are being considered federally.

255
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:22,844
In Bill [inaudible].
David repeats his commitment to the to 

256
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:32,700
the forum or the university is quite 
prepared to host a forum where arguments

257
00:15:32,701 --> 00:15:33,534
are presented concerning the gender 
identity and gender expression 

258
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,470
protections of the Ontario Human Rights 
Code,

259
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,900
or those being considered under bill 
[inaudible].

260
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,163
Arguments are presented concerning 
freedom of expression and how it should 

261
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:48,380
properly relate to nondiscrimination 
protections that exist in Canadian law.

262
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,173
Arguments are presented as to any 
alternatives that might be preferable 

263
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,193
and slash or discussing,
listen to and respond to arguments of 

264
00:15:56,811 --> 00:15:59,360
colleagues who may have different views 
on these subjects.

265
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:02,963
The university cannot host a forum that 
will offer a platform for an expressed 

266
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:08,364
intention to engage in conduct with your
students and colleagues that you 

267
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:13,530
appeared to have Nolan acknowledged 
would have been in,

268
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,140
would be in violation of the Ontario 
Human Rights Code.

269
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,553
If you wish to engage in a further 
discussion about this way of proceeding 

270
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:23,960
with the scholarly forum,
we would be glad to receive your written

271
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:25,430
comments.
Yours sincerely.

272
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:27,270
David Cameron,
Dean,

273
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,420
Faculty Arts and Science.
So

274
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,850
I slept on that and,
and,

275
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,710
and,
and I'll tell you what I decided to do.

276
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,773
So I talked about it,
talked it over again with my family and 

277
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,200
some friends who have been following 
this and who are wise people.

278
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,513
And,
and then I also thought about this in 

279
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:54,200
mythological terms,
so I'll give you the context of that.

280
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:55,034
So

281
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,013
one of the oldest stories we have got to
the story in genesis indicates that the 

282
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,230
environments that people find themselves
in at an architectural level.

283
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:09,530
So this is all human environments could 
be likened to a garden,

284
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:13,790
a walled garden,
a is a means walled garden.

285
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,430
An Eden means well watered place by the 
way.

286
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,743
And so genesis presents the proper 
environment for human beings as a a 

287
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,190
garden with walls.
I'm a well watered garden with walls and

288
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:26,024
so that's a combination of of of culture
and nature that the walls are culture 

289
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,930
and the garden itself is nature and so 
human beings lived in a,

290
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,183
in a,
in an environment that's always partly 

291
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:37,004
nature and partly culture and those two 
things need to be kept in proper 

292
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:41,594
balance.
But the thing about the garden is that 

293
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,220
there's always a snake in the garden and
it's.

294
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:47,810
It's like the idea that there's a snake 
in the garden.

295
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:51,000
There is the idea that nothing can exist
without,

296
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,953
without a flaw.
Nothing can actually exist that doesn't 

297
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:59,451
have a serious flaw and the same ideas 
expressed in certain Asian ideas.

298
00:17:59,731 --> 00:18:00,564
For example,
the Buddhist beautiful Buddhist Gardens 

299
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:07,641
in Japan very carefully manicured,
always have a flaw as often do a certain

300
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,553
forms of Japanese pottery and it 
expresses the same idea that that 

301
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:18,000
reality to exist must be allowed to have
its flaws.

302
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,010
And the Yin and Yang symbol is like that
too.

303
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:22,530
Because in the,
in the chaos serpent,

304
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,393
there's a white dot that indicates that 
in every chaotic circumstance order can 

305
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:30,270
emerge and in the and in the white 
serpent,

306
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,104
there's a block dot which indicates that
in every orderly place that a chaotic 

307
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:35,724
element can emerge,
but you can't get away from the tension 

308
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:39,690
of opposites.
And so I thought,

309
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:40,524
well,
it's necessary for this debate to 

310
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:45,980
proceed because it's important and,
and I want the,

311
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,093
the topics here to be aired properly and
thoroughly and it would be better for 

312
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:52,610
the university to host it.

313
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,453
I,
I very seriously considered renting a 

314
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:58,080
theater and just making my views known 
there.

315
00:18:58,081 --> 00:18:58,914
But I thought that's not as good as 
having the other side have it's 

316
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:06,420
opportunity to have their concerns 
noted.

317
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,010
And I agreed that I would provide my 
arguments,

318
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,450
at least an outline of my arguments to 
my opposition,

319
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:16,284
let's say,
or to the people on the other side of 

320
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:17,934
the discussion beforehand.
So that they had a chance to marshal 

321
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:20,454
their arguments.
And so I decided that despite this 

322
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,863
restriction,
which is still the precise nature of 

323
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:31,320
which is still to be determined,
that it would be better,

324
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:34,860
all things considered to go ahead with 
the debate.

325
00:19:34,861 --> 00:19:35,694
And so it,
it looks like it's likely to occur 

326
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,460
sometime in the next two weeks.
And um,

327
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,030
and that's that.
But I would like to close by noting that

328
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,640
the university appears to have made its 
choice.

329
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,680
And when I met David on Friday,
we had a somewhat more heated exchange,

330
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,190
still friendly,
I would say,

331
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,833
where I suggested that the university is
making a big mistake here and that they 

332
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:05,970
have to make a decision as Jonathan 
Haidt said about which side they're on.

333
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:06,804
And that if the university,
the university has substantial legal 

334
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:11,910
resources and if they were as concerned 
about free speech as I think they should

335
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,430
be.
And as their own policy,

336
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,530
which I'm supposed to abide by by the 
way.

337
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,853
Because because I'm supposed to abide by
university policies that the university 

338
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,373
policy on free speech,
which I think is its highest order 

339
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:28,230
policy,
suggests that I have the right.

340
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:29,064
Or perhaps maybe even the obligation to 
criticize the university and society at 

341
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:32,964
large without,
without reference to any preordained 

342
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:38,270
conclusions.
And so I,

343
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,640
I strongly suggested to David that,
um,

344
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,210
the university is on the wrong side of 
this,

345
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:46,044
that they picked the side of the social 
warriors over this side of freedom of 

346
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:50,404
expression,
or perhaps even as Jonathan Haidt has 

347
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:52,804
pointed out,
perhaps even over truth and that that's 

348
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:56,044
a huge mistake,
that they're violating the most 

349
00:20:57,641 --> 00:21:00,850
fundamental principle upon which the 
university is predicated.

350
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,220
And I sincerely believe that to be the 
case,

351
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,653
but I've decided to go forward with the 
debate because I believe that a flawed 

352
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:09,664
debate is better than none.
And perhaps all you can hope for in the 

353
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:18,001
world of actuality is a flawed process 
that can grow and struggle.

354
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:19,534
However,
wretchedly and awkwardly towards 

355
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,420
something that might be regarded as the 
truth.

356
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,510
So make no mistake about it.
This is what's happened.

357
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,703
The university has drawn the lines and 
they have decided that if they have to 

358
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:38,200
support political correctness slash 
social justice,

359
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,740
um,
neo Marxism or freedom of speech,

360
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,950
then they're going to pick the former.
And not the latter,

361
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,023
and so that's the state of the art at 
Canada's perhaps Canada's greatest 

362
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:54,130
educational institution.
And I would say that's also the,

363
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,300
uh,
a diagnostic indicator of the,

364
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:59,643
shall we call it the state of the 
polluted water works that make up our 

365
00:22:04,511 --> 00:22:09,160
current culture and as spokes frog for 
the nation.

366
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,540
Let's say I'm,
I'm stating quite bluntly,

367
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:17,350
that we better clean up our act or 
there's going to be hell to pay.

368
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,873
It's not easy being green
having to spend each day the color of 

369
00:22:31,581 --> 00:22:36,581
the leaves
when I think it might be nicer being red

370
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:43,750
or yellow or gold or copper,
much more colorful light.

371
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,613
Then.
