1
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,170
Thank you.
Thank

2
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,170
you.
So I've been thinking about things that 

3
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,331
I'm happy about and what I'm most happy 
about so far is that I haven't spilled 

4
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:49,771
my,
my bubbly water into my computer so far 

5
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:50,350
while I've been doing these lectures,
so that's always.

6
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:53,620
I'll probably do it tonight now that I'm
bragging about having avoided it.

7
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:54,790
So,
uh,

8
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,810
thank you all for coming.
This is the last lecture in this 12 part

9
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:03,811
series.
I did mention that I have made 

10
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:06,841
arrangements with the theater at least 
to do this once a month for the next 

11
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:10,021
four months and we'll see.
We'll play it by year past then I want 

12
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:11,230
to continue and I'll find another venue 
and perhaps to do it every two weeks,

13
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:15,160
but certainly once a month and maybe I 
can even get deeper into the material if

14
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:20,161
it's only once a month.
So that would be then when then will 

15
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:20,161
really slow down to a snail's crawl.

16
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,870
So this is a tough one tonight.
You know,

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,920
it's something,
a story that everyone with any sense 

18
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,170
should approach with a substantial 
degree of trepidation.

19
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:34,030
I've been working on my book this week 
on Chapter Seven,

20
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,810
which is called do what is meaningful,
not what's expedient,

21
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,740
and it's really,
it's been a very difficult chapter 

22
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,081
because I'm coming to it,
I'm trying to extend my understanding of

23
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:52,531
sacrifice,
which is of course what we're going to 

24
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:52,531
talk about tonight in great detail.
Um,

25
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,360
and,
and I've been wrestling with exactly how

26
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:57,370
to do that.
And I'm going to read you some of that.

27
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,340
I think today I don't generally read 
when I do my lectures,

28
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:05,341
but this is so complicated that I'm not 
confident of my ability to just spin it 

29
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:05,740
off,
you know,

30
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:06,660
sort of,
um,

31
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,310
what would you call it?
A spontaneously,

32
00:02:09,311 --> 00:02:14,311
that's the word.
And so andy last give me a chance to 

33
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:18,871
test out whether what I've written,
which I've been struggling with has the 

34
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:19,630
kind of poetic flow that I'd like to 
have.

35
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,670
If you're writing,
it's really good to read things aloud,

36
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:26,671
you know,
because you can tell if you've got the 

37
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:26,671
rhythmic cadence right then.
So,

38
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:28,900
so anyways,
thank you all for coming.

39
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:30,490
Many of you have,
I believe,

40
00:02:30,491 --> 00:02:33,700
attended all 12 lectures and that's 
really remarkable.

41
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:35,340
It's amazing that,
you know,

42
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,340
this place has been full every single 
lecture rights completely unbelievable.

43
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:41,050
That would be the case.
And you know,

44
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:46,051
about more than 2 million views of this 
has been watched more than 2 million 

45
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:50,791
views.
It's not 2 million people because it 

46
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:50,791
would be the same people I would suspect
many times,

47
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:55,111
but that's also crazy,
but it's a crazy world and it seems to 

48
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:59,280
be getting crazier.
So hopefully this is some addition to 

49
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
stabilizing it and making slightly more 
sane.

50
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,040
That's the hope.
Anyways,

51
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,120
so we've got a couple of stories to deal
with tonight.

52
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,980
Um,
complex,

53
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,150
complex stories.
I'm not really easy to comprehend in any

54
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:17,020
sense of the sense of the word.
I mean with the story of Isaiah.

55
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,360
God calls on his,
his,

56
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,640
his chosen individual,
Abraham,

57
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:25,180
the person who's made this contract with
to sacrifice his son.

58
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:30,181
And it's in.
How in the world are you supposed to 

59
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:30,280
make sensible,
any sort of sensible fence out of that.

60
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,310
It's exactly that sort of story that 
makes modern people who are convinced 

61
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,930
that the faster we put the biblical 
stories behind this,

62
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:39,820
the better.
It's grist for the mill.

63
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:44,821
You know,
because it seems like such a 

64
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:46,660
incomprehensible and even barbaric act 
on the part of God and so you know,

65
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,900
I,
I hesitate to even approach it because,

66
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,670
well,
because there's so many ways that the 

67
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:56,670
interpretation of that sort can go 
wrong,

68
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:56,830
but we'll see how it goes.

69
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,380
And so let's walk through it and see 
what happens.

70
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,200
So we're gonna Start with a story of 
Sarah and Isaac,

71
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,430
and the Lord visited Sarah as he had 
said.

72
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,580
You remember when Abraham was in the 
midst of his appropriate sacrificial 

73
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:16,741
routines,
which we've characterized as his return 

74
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:17,710
to the contract he made with the idea of
the good,

75
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,910
the contract with God.
He was informed by God that he would get

76
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:24,100
what he most wanted,
which was an error.

77
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:25,990
And he,
despite his advanced old age,

78
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:30,991
and of course Sarah was very skeptical 
about that as she had every reason to 

79
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:34,681
be.
But this story opens with the 

80
00:04:34,681 --> 00:04:37,750
fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham.
And the Lord visited Sarah as he had 

81
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,361
said,
and the Lord Did unto Sarah as he had 

82
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:44,650
spoken for Sarah conceived and bore 
Abraham a son in his old age.

83
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,890
At the set time of which God had spoken 
to him,

84
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,190
and Abraham called the name of his son 
that was born unto him whom Sarah 

85
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,930
Barrett to him,
Isaac and Abraham circumcised his son,

86
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:58,750
Isaac being eight days old as God 
commanded him,

87
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,780
had commanded him,
and Abraham was 100 years old when his 

88
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,860
son Isaac was born unto him and Sarah 
said,

89
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,420
garth had made God.

90
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:12,420
Had God have made me laugh so that all 
that here will laugh with me.

91
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,120
And she said,
who would've said unto Abraham that 

92
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,120
Sarah should have given children's suck 
for?

93
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,651
I have born him a son in his old age and
the child grew and was weaned and 

94
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:24,850
Abraham made a great feast the same day 
that Isaac was weaned.

95
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,660
I suppose one of the,
one of the purposes,

96
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:33,661
let's say perhaps the literary purposes 
of this story is to exaggerate for 

97
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,100
dramatic purposes the importance of a 
child.

98
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,980
You know,
when people are young,

99
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,680
and I think this is particularly true in
the modern world,

100
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,640
they seem to often regard the,
the possibility of having a child as an 

101
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:54,160
impediment to their lifestyle.
You know,

102
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,740
and of course in some ways I suppose 
that's true,

103
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,160
although you have to have quite a 
lifestyle before a child actually 

104
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,941
constitutes an impediment because having
a child in your life is actually 

105
00:06:06,941 --> 00:06:08,630
something that's remarkable almost 
beyond belief.

106
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,000
You know,
you can have a relationship with a child

107
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:16,001
that is better than any relationship 
you've ever had with anyone in your 

108
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,821
life.
If you're careful and if you're 

109
00:06:18,821 --> 00:06:18,821
fortunate,
fortunate.

110
00:06:18,821 --> 00:06:20,800
Being fortunate helps,
you know,

111
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,490
I've seen many people delay having 
children and for understandable reasons.

112
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:30,491
It's no simple decision to have a child 
and of course now we can make the 

113
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:33,611
decision to have a child,
which of course people couldn't in in 

114
00:06:33,611 --> 00:06:36,701
past ages really.
But sometimes you see people delay and 

115
00:06:36,701 --> 00:06:39,911
they delay too long and then they don't 
get to have a child and then they're 

116
00:06:39,911 --> 00:06:42,581
desperate and you know,
they spent a decade doing fertility 

117
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:45,701
treatments or that sort of thing and 
immersing themselves in one 

118
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:46,730
disappointment after another.
And it's just at that point what you see

119
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:48,620
exactly how catastrophic it is.

120
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,650
It can be how catastrophic it can be for
people not to have one of the.

121
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,380
Not to be able to undergo one of the 
great adventures of life,

122
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:03,370
let's say,
and one of the things this story does by

123
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,880
by delaying the arrival of Isaac and 
delaying the arrival of Isaac 

124
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,021
continually is to exaggerate the the 
important significance of the child 

125
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:15,640
because it isn't until you're deprived 
of something,

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
it's truly not until you're deprived of 
something that you have any sense of 

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,490
what its value is,
and Isaac was waiting,

128
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,130
or Abraham was waiting a very long time,
100 years,

129
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,410
a very long time,
and the same with Sarah,

130
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:31,470
and so they're unbelievably excited and 
of course this also heightens the drama 

131
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,670
that's inherent in the entire 
sacrificial story because it's not only 

132
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,350
that eventually that Abraham is called 
upon to sacrifice Isaac,

133
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,210
which would be bad enough under any 
other,

134
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,870
any circumstances whatsoever,
self-evidently,

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
but the fact that he's been waiting a 
century for the arrival of this child 

136
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:53,130
desperately and made all the proper 
sacrifices and lived in the appropriate 

137
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,860
manner to allow this to occur.
Der dramatically heightens the,

138
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,740
the,
the,

139
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,990
the literary tension.

140
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Now you remember Hagar,
this is the next part of the story Hagar

141
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:09,770
was,
is,

142
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:14,830
was Sarah's handmade,
and when Sarah was unable to bear 

143
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,940
Abraham a child,
she sent him,

144
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:21,941
Hagar and Hagar immediately got pregnant
and gave birth to Ishmael.

145
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,470
And,
uh,

146
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,690
the story picks up from that point here.
And this is quite interesting.

147
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,380
I mentioned the other week when I was 
talking to you guys a couple of weeks in

148
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:36,381
a row.
Just how interesting it has been to 

149
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,451
scour the Internet for the,
for the paintings that are associated 

150
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:38,451
with these stories.
There's just,

151
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:42,981
uh,
there's an amazing wealth of great 

152
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:43,440
paintings that illustrate every single 
bit of the,

153
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,650
of every single biblical story.
And it's,

154
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:47,540
it's,
it's,

155
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:52,541
uh,
it's really been enlightening to me to 

156
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:52,541
find out just exactly how poorly 
educated I am.

157
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:53,010
You know,
like I,

158
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,360
I'm an,
I'm a what would say I'm a,

159
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,790
I'm a great admirer of,
of artistic talent and of artistic 

160
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,361
endeavor,
but there's so much I don't know about 

161
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:05,730
the history of art,
that it's just absolutely beyond belief.

162
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:10,731
And to see this treasure trove of images
that I really had no idea that existed.

163
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Of course,
they're spread all over the world and 

164
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,650
it's only been in recent years that you 
could have access to them in this way.

165
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,120
It's just a.
it's a,

166
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:24,310
it's a,
it's a constant revelation of the depth 

167
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,830
to which these stories have absolutely 
permeated our culture and the loss that 

168
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,070
it would be if we didn't know them 
properly and,

169
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,880
and take them with the degree of 
seriousness that they deserve.

170
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:38,510
So anyways,
this is one of those great images and 

171
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,630
Sarah saw the son of Hagar,
the Egyptian,

172
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:42,180
which she had born unto Abraham,
mocking.

173
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:48,830
Wherefore she said unto Abraham,
cast out this bonds woman and her son 

174
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,580
for the son of this bonds woman shall 
not be heir with my son,

175
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,640
even with Isaac.
And the thing was very grievous in 

176
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,521
Abraham's sight because of his son was 
being quite a bit of tension between 

177
00:09:58,521 --> 00:09:59,940
Abraham or between Sarah and Hagar.

178
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,500
As you could imagine,
there might be.

179
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:02,970
Why wouldn't there be?
I mean,

180
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:07,971
first of all,
Hagar had the first child and that 

181
00:10:07,971 --> 00:10:09,040
elevated her status and she was,
Sarah's made handmade,

182
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,130
and so that's obviously going to be 
quite awkward.

183
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:13,270
And then she,
um,

184
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,940
she lorded it over Sarah because of the 
fact that she got pregnant so easily.

185
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:22,941
And now we see this situation where 
Ishmael is doing the same thing with 

186
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:27,681
regards to Isaac and not causes a 
substantial amount of trouble.

187
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,350
The family is a familial division 
occurring here.

188
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,990
And God said unto Abraham,
let it not be grievous in eyesight 

189
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,180
because of the loud.
And because of the Bond Woman in all 

190
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,640
that Sarah Hath said unto the Hearken 
unto her voice,

191
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,940
for in Isaac shall thy seed be called 
and,

192
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,970
but also of the son of the bond woman,
will I make a nation?

193
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:49,230
Because he is vi seed.

194
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,130
That's.
So,

195
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:52,050
that's,
that's an interesting outcome to,

196
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,710
you know,
we,

197
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,270
we pointed out before we discussed 
before the fact that because Abraham has

198
00:10:57,271 --> 00:11:00,360
made,
has lived his life properly in his,

199
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:03,510
kept the contract with God.
There's every evidence in the story that

200
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:07,020
no matter what the vicissitudes of 
Abraham's life,

201
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:12,330
you know how the great serpent that he 
sits on in some sense weaves back and 

202
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,641
forth.
There's always the promise that things 

203
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:18,750
will work out positively and you know,
you could read that as naive optimism,

204
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:23,751
but I think it has a lot more to do with
the actual power of keeping the 

205
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:29,331
contractual agreement.
Because I really do believe and I've 

206
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:31,050
spent a tremendous amount of time 
thinking about this over the last couple

207
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,490
of weeks in addition to the decades 
before.

208
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:33,920
That is that.
And,

209
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:39,010
and,
and all that's happened since I've been 

210
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,211
doing these biblical lectures is that my
conviction and this has been 

211
00:11:41,211 --> 00:11:41,211
strengthened,
which is quite interesting,

212
00:11:41,211 --> 00:11:45,381
is that if you,
if you do what it is that you're called 

213
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:49,911
upon to do,
which is to lift your eyes up above the 

214
00:11:49,911 --> 00:11:50,550
mundane,
daily selfish,

215
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,760
impulsive issues that might be set you 
and attempt to enter into a contractual 

216
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,290
relationship with that which you might 
hold in the highest regard.

217
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,350
Whatever that might be.
To aim high and to,

218
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:04,900
and to,
and to make that important.

219
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:09,901
Above all else in your life that,
that fortifies you against the 

220
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:10,930
vicissitudes of existence like nothing 
else can.

221
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:15,931
And I truly believe that that's the most
practical advice that you can possibly,

222
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,620
that you could possibly receive.
You know,

223
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,840
I received,
I was answering questions last night.

224
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:25,480
I did this q and a,
which I do about once a month for,

225
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:30,790
um,
for the people who are supporting me on 

226
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,930
Patrion which also released on Youtube.
And somebody asked,

227
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:37,230
you know,
they were struggling with their 

228
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:37,230
religious faith and they asked what they
could do about that.

229
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:41,401
And I'd also been thinking about the 
difference between Nietzsche and 

230
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:42,880
Dostoevsky,
which we'll discuss in a minute.

231
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,360
And I was trying to answer this question
with regards to religious faith because 

232
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,480
he,
he,

233
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,000
this person was shaky and his faith in 
life,

234
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:52,420
let's say.

235
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,900
Which is a better way of thinking about 
it.

236
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:56,680
And,
and it seems to me that the way that you

237
00:12:56,681 --> 00:13:01,681
fortify your faith in being and in life 
and your own existence isn't to try to 

238
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:06,061
convince yourself of the existence of a 
transcendent power that you could 

239
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:09,400
believe in the same way that you believe
in a set of empirical facts.

240
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:11,140
I don't,
I don't think that's the right approach.

241
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,060
I think it's a weak approach.
Actually.

242
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,890
I don't think that the cognitive 
technology that I don't think that's the

243
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:20,530
right cognitive technology for that set 
of problems.

244
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:23,890
You know,
that's more a technology that you use if

245
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:25,510
you were trying to solve a scientific 
problem.

246
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,930
It's more like it's more something that 
needs to be embedded in action rather 

247
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:36,271
than in sustainable belief and the way 
that you fortify your faith in life is 

248
00:13:36,271 --> 00:13:38,020
to assume the best,
something like that.

249
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,720
And then to act courageously in 
relationship to that.

250
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,160
And,
and that's,

251
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:46,120
that's tantamount to expressing your 
faith in the highest possible good.

252
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:48,220
It's tantamount to expressing your faith
in God.

253
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,350
And it's not a matter of stating,
well,

254
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:52,990
I believe in the existence of a 
transcendent that daddy,

255
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:54,820
because in some sense,
who cares,

256
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,060
who cares what you believe,
I mean,

257
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,480
you might and all that,
but,

258
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,180
but that's not the issue.
That's not the issue.

259
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,460
The issue,
it seems to me is how you act.

260
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:08,461
And I was thinking about this intensely 
when I was thinking about Nietzsche and 

261
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:12,481
Dostoevsky because of course,
you know that Nietzsche was the 

262
00:14:12,481 --> 00:14:12,520
philosopher who announced the death of 
God,

263
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:13,600
right?
And who is a great,

264
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:18,601
great critic of Christianity at vicious 
critic of Institutional Christianity in 

265
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:19,240
the best sense,
you know,

266
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,820
and uh,
you announced the death of God.

267
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:25,090
And he said that we'd never find enough 
water to wash away the blood.

268
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:30,090
It wasn't a triumphant proclamation even
though it's often read that way and 

269
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:33,100
don't need niches.
Conclusion from that,

270
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:35,380
from the death of God,
the fact that our ethical systems,

271
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:40,381
we're going to collapse.
When the foundation was pulled out from 

272
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:40,381
underneath them,
he believed that human beings would have

273
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:43,150
to find their own values to create their
own values.

274
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:48,420
And there's a problem with that because 
it doesn't seem that this is something 

275
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,270
Carl young was very thorough and 
investigating.

276
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:54,271
It doesn't really look like people are 
capable of creating their own values 

277
00:14:54,271 --> 00:14:56,930
because you're not really capable of 
molding yourself just any old way.

278
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:59,870
You want to be like you have a nature 
that you have to contend with,

279
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,320
and so it isn't a matter of creating our
own values because we don't have that 

280
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,761
capacity.
It might be a matter of rediscovering 

281
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:12,251
those values,
which is what Jung was attempting to do 

282
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:12,251
now.

283
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:12,251
And,
and,

284
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:17,140
and so.
I think nature was actually profoundly 

285
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:17,140
wrong in that,
in that recommendation.

286
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,280
I think he was psychologically wrong.
Now you know,

287
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,820
there was the Esky wrote in many ways in
parallel to.

288
00:15:23,821 --> 00:15:25,730
Nisha was a great influence on Ninja 
there.

289
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:30,731
Their lives parallel each other to a 
degree that's somewhat miraculous in 

290
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:31,040
some senses.
It's quite uncanny.

291
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,650
Dostoevsky was obviously a literary 
figure,

292
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:36,440
whether whereas nature was a 
philosopher,

293
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,470
a literary philosopher,
but still a philosopher and Dostoevsky 

294
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,760
wrestled with exactly the same problems 
that,

295
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,840
that nature wrestled with.
And,

296
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:49,930
but he did it in a different way.
He didn't literary manner and he has 

297
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,771
this great book and the Brothers 
Karamazov and in that book there's a 

298
00:15:53,771 --> 00:15:56,540
hero of the book is really Lee Osha 
Who's a monastic novitiate,

299
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,590
a very good guy,
kind of a,

300
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,440
not an intellect,
not an intellect,

301
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:03,020
but uh,
a person of great character,

302
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,040
you know,
but he has a brother Ivan who his older 

303
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,121
brother who a great intellect and,
and a very handsome soldier and a brave 

304
00:16:10,121 --> 00:16:10,121
man.

305
00:16:10,121 --> 00:16:12,830
And like Dostoyevsky's villains.
See Ivan isn't exactly a villain,

306
00:16:12,831 --> 00:16:17,831
but that's close enough.
Ivan or Dostoevsky makes his villains 

307
00:16:17,831 --> 00:16:19,340
extraordinarily powerful.
So if Dostoevsky's trying to work out an

308
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:20,030
argument,
he,

309
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,480
he clothes the argument in the,
in the flash of one of his characters 

310
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,280
and if it's an argument he doesn't agree
with and he makes that character as 

311
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,401
strong as he possibly can,
as strong and as attractive and 

312
00:16:33,401 --> 00:16:34,990
intelligent as he possibly can.
And then he let some just have outer.

313
00:16:34,991 --> 00:16:39,991
And so Ivan is constantly attacking Lee 
Osha and from every direction trying to 

314
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:43,140
knock him off his perch of faith,
let's say.

315
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,320
And the Osha Lee.
Osha can't address a single one of 

316
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,590
Ivan's criticisms.
And,

317
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,360
and he doesn't have the intellect for 
it.

318
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:50,930
And,
and,

319
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,910
and Ivan has a devastating intellect.
It's devastating to him himself as well.

320
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,500
What happens in the brothers Karamazov 
essentially is the lel.

321
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,170
Osha continues to act out his commitment
to the good,

322
00:17:03,171 --> 00:17:05,780
let's say.
And in that manner he's triumphant.

323
00:17:05,781 --> 00:17:10,781
It doesn't matter that he loses the 
arguments because the arguments aren't 

324
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:11,030
exactly the point,
the arguments in some sense,

325
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,340
our aside issue,
because the issue is,

326
00:17:13,341 --> 00:17:18,341
and this is the existential issue,
the issue is not what you believe as if 

327
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:22,661
it's a set of facts,
but how you conduct yourself in the 

328
00:17:22,661 --> 00:17:22,661
world.
And so Dostoevsky,

329
00:17:22,661 --> 00:17:24,290
he grasped that and it's one of the 
things that makes him such a,

330
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:29,650
an amazing,
amazing literary figure and amazing 

331
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,641
genius because he was smart enough to,
to formulate the arguments in a manner 

332
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,610
that no one else really could with the 
possible exception of nature.

333
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,640
And that's quite an exception.
And yet he could still using his 

334
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,551
dramatic embodiment,
he could still lay out solutions to the 

335
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:49,241
problems that he was describing that are
extremely compelling and both crime and 

336
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:51,750
punishment,
which is an amazing,

337
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,450
thrilling,
engrossing book.

338
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,690
And the brothers Karamazov all of 
Dostoyevsky's great books really 

339
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,230
circulated around around those profound 
moral issues.

340
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:03,420
And so I've learned a tremendous amount 
from,

341
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:07,740
from reading him so and God said unto 
Abraham,

342
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,410
let it not be grievous and eyesight 
because of the loud.

343
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:13,080
And because of that bond woman in all 
it's Sarah has said unto Thee,

344
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:16,320
hearkened unto her voice for a nice,
for in Isaiah,

345
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:20,670
Excel shall thy seed be called.
And also of the son of the bond woman,

346
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:22,860
will I make it nation?
Because he is a seed.

347
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
All right,
so I commented that Abraham is being 

348
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,830
blessed in multiple directions even when
things are going wrong.

349
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:32,700
And this is pretty bad because his 
family in some sense is breaking up the.

350
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,760
There's this emphasis in the text that 
because he's kept this contractual 

351
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,080
relationship with God,
that,

352
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,290
that he's in an arc.
We could say it,

353
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,520
that we could put it that way.

354
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,100
And that the,
the,

355
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,400
that he'll,
he'll try.

356
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:47,280
I'm through the vicissitudes of life,
which is the best you can hope for.

357
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:48,930
And it's quite interesting.
Again,

358
00:18:48,931 --> 00:18:51,750
one of the things that's so powerful 
about the abrahamic stories is that it's

359
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:54,210
not like Abraham,
even though he is chosen by God,

360
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,580
it's not like he has an easy time of it.
He has a rough life.

361
00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:58,200
I mean it's a successful life and all 
that,

362
00:18:58,201 --> 00:18:59,700
but it's not,
it's not,

363
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,640
it's not a,
it's not without its troubles,

364
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,710
that's for sure.
It's got every sort of trouble you could

365
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,240
possibly imagine pretty much.
And,

366
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,400
and that's one of the things that makes 
the story so realistic as far as I'm 

367
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,310
concerned.
And Abraham rose up early in the morning

368
00:19:13,311 --> 00:19:16,790
and took bread and a bottle of water and
gave it unto Hagar,

369
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,240
putting it on her shoulder and the child
and sent her away.

370
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,240
And she departed and wandered in the 
wilderness of

371
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,690
yeshiva.
I found the.

372
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:33,190
It's funny,
I guess this had more of an emotional 

373
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:33,190
impact on me this week than it might 
have because my daughter just had a baby

374
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,680
a week ago and so I've been thinking 
about this sort of thing,

375
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:41,830
you know,
we're so happy that that's happened and 

376
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,860
I was trying to put yourself in the,
what would you say,

377
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:47,861
the conceptual space of the people about
who this stories or people who these 

378
00:19:47,991 --> 00:19:50,420
stories are about and trying to,
you know,

379
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:54,680
notice the catastrophe that this sort of
breakup would actually constitute.

380
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:57,440
And No,
and the visual images really helped with

381
00:19:57,441 --> 00:20:00,200
that because they're,
they're so carefully crafted and,

382
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,460
and they hit the story from so many 
different directions that,

383
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:09,790
you know,
they add that an additional layer of 

384
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:09,790
emotional meaning to it,
which I found very,

385
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:14,261
very significant.
And the water was spent in the bottle 

386
00:20:14,261 --> 00:20:17,981
and she cast the child under one of the 
shrubs and she sent to wandering the 

387
00:20:17,981 --> 00:20:17,990
desert,
you know?

388
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:21,260
So it's not just that she has to leave 
Abraham's household,

389
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:25,250
it's that where she goes,
it's not really amenable to life.

390
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:28,770
And so it's,
it's extraordinarily dramatic and and,

391
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:33,970
and terrible tale,
and she went and sat her down over 

392
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,690
against him,
a good way off as it were,

393
00:20:35,691 --> 00:20:37,910
a bowshot for.
She said,

394
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:42,500
let me not see the death of the child.
And she sat over against him and lift up

395
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:43,700
her voice and wept,

396
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:50,810
and God heard the voice of the loud and 
the angel of God called to Hagar out of 

397
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,890
heaven and said unto her what Aileth 
Hagar,

398
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,640
fear not for God hath heard the voice of
the lad where he is rise.

399
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,930
Lift up the lad and hold them in nine 
hand for I will make him a great nation.

400
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:12,020
And God opened her eyes and she saw a 
well of water and she went and filled 

401
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,180
the bottle with water and gave the lead 
drink.

402
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:23,260
And God was with the loud and he grew 
and dwelt in the wilderness and became 

403
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,501
an archer.
That's actually irrelevant detail to 

404
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:26,660
that.
The fact that he became an archer,

405
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:31,661
because I think I mentioned to you at 
one point that the word sin is derived 

406
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:35,651
from a Greek word Amartya.
Even though it sounds nothing like that 

407
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:38,291
word,
Hamartia is actually a an archery term 

408
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:38,630
and it means to,

409
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,920
it means to miss the Bullseye and that's
a.

410
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:47,110
that's a lovely metaphor for sand.
I think because it's associated so 

411
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:50,240
tightly with the idea of,
of goal direction and an aim,

412
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,940
you know,
because there's an,

413
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,800
there's a metaphorical idea that's 
embedded in that,

414
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,230
in that image and that is that,
you know,

415
00:21:57,231 --> 00:22:00,590
a human being is something that 
specifies a target,

416
00:22:00,591 --> 00:22:02,420
which we do all the time with her eyes.
By the way,

417
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,300
I mean our eyes,
our target specifying mechanisms.

418
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:10,330
You know,
we have very precise central focal 

419
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,990
vision and we use our focal vision to 
target the aim of our behavior.

420
00:22:11,991 --> 00:22:14,480
And so we are aiming creatures.
There's are,

421
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,730
it's built right into our plot,
our body,

422
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,890
or we're.
We're built on a hunting platform.

423
00:22:18,891 --> 00:22:22,550
We're aiming creatures and we do that 
cognitively as well as behaviorally.

424
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:27,551
And so as hunters,
we take aim at things that we take aim 

425
00:22:27,551 --> 00:22:30,821
at moving targets and we're very good at
bringing them down and we'd been doing 

426
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:31,820
that for who knows how long,
millions of years really.

427
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,190
Even chimpanzees are carnivorous by the 
way,

428
00:22:34,191 --> 00:22:36,290
and we split from them about 6 million 
years ago,

429
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,290
so we've been hunting and aiming for a 
very,

430
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,560
very long period of time and we still 
have aims in our life.

431
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,790
Right.
And that's how we describe them.

432
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,410
What are you aiming at or what are your 
aims,

433
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:47,780
what are your goals,
what's your target?

434
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:53,050
It's all based on that hunting metaphor 
and the fact that Ishmael becomes an 

435
00:22:53,361 --> 00:22:58,361
archer means that he is someone who can 
take aim at the center of the Bullseye 

436
00:22:58,361 --> 00:23:02,261
and hit it precisely.
And so that's an indication that he's a 

437
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:02,261
good man.
Right?

438
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,070
So,
and,

439
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:11,220
and I suppose also part of the part of 
it carries part of the narrative weight 

440
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,830
of the story because of course he's 
Abraham's son and you'd expect Abraham's

441
00:23:13,831 --> 00:23:18,831
son to be someone who's very good at 
taking aim and he dwelt in the 

442
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:19,800
wilderness of Paran and he could live 
there and survive,

443
00:23:19,801 --> 00:23:24,801
which is no trivial thing.
And his mother took him a wife out of 

444
00:23:24,801 --> 00:23:26,370
the land of Egypt.
Okay.

445
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:29,160
So that's the story of Hagar and it's a 
fairly straightforward story.

446
00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:32,450
It's complex emotionally,
but it doesn't and it and it.

447
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:37,510
It brings up the terrible theme of a 
familial catastrophe and the 

448
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,271
complications of of romantic and 
familial relationships and all of that,

449
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:45,030
but it really serves as a prodrome on to
the next story,

450
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,800
which is the one that's so complex and 
so difficult to understand

451
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,650
and it came to pass after these things 
that God did tempt Abraham,

452
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,160
which is a funny thing for God to do,
I suppose,

453
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,850
and said unto him Abraham,
and he said,

454
00:24:03,851 --> 00:24:05,440
behold,
here I am,

455
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,050
and God said,
take now thy son the only son,

456
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:17,051
Isaac,
who who they'll love us and get thee 

457
00:24:17,051 --> 00:24:19,361
into the land of Moriah and offer him 
there for a burnt offering upon one of 

458
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:24,521
the mountains which I will tell the of,
and Abraham rose up early in the morning

459
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:34,580
and saddled his ass and took two of his 
young men with him and Isaac his son and

460
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:40,150
clave the wood for the burnt offering 
and rose up and went under the place of 

461
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,850
which God had told him.
Then on the third day of journeying,

462
00:24:42,851 --> 00:24:47,680
Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the 
place afar off and Abraham said unto his

463
00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:48,970
young men,
abide he,

464
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:53,971
he here with the ass and I and the lad 
will go yonder and worship and come 

465
00:24:54,581 --> 00:24:55,270
again to you.

466
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,710
It's really one of the first times that 
we've come across the word worship,

467
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:07,711
if I remember correctly,
and it's a very difficult word to 

468
00:25:07,711 --> 00:25:10,261
contend with to know because if you're 
like me or if you're like me when I was 

469
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:12,460
a kid,
because I haven't thought about this for

470
00:25:12,461 --> 00:25:17,461
a long time,
it was never really obvious to me why 

471
00:25:17,461 --> 00:25:17,461
God would want to be worshiped.
You know,

472
00:25:17,461 --> 00:25:21,641
if you go to church and you offer up 
your praise and thanks to God and you 

473
00:25:21,641 --> 00:25:22,150
think,
well relate.

474
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,920
Does that make a lot of sense?
It's like,

475
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:26,080
why in the world is that what he wants?
It's like,

476
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,880
it's almost like you're,
you're,

477
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,390
you're

478
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,780
kneeling down in front of an,
of an ancient,

479
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:33,400
Middle Eastern,
you know,

480
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:35,480
tyrannical emperor and,
and,

481
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:40,420
and vowing your submission.
And that never sat well with me.

482
00:25:40,421 --> 00:25:45,421
And I,
I suppose it doesn't sit well with many 

483
00:25:45,421 --> 00:25:47,251
people and I think that's because it's 
not the proper way of conceptualizing 

484
00:25:47,251 --> 00:25:50,941
it.
What happens when you see what Abraham 

485
00:25:50,941 --> 00:25:52,510
does continually,
and this seems to be implicit in the use

486
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:55,630
of the word worship in this particular 
situation,

487
00:25:55,631 --> 00:25:58,090
is that he,
as we discussed,

488
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:03,091
he,
he has an adventure in his life that 

489
00:26:03,091 --> 00:26:03,091
comes to an end.
So there's an episode in his life,

490
00:26:03,091 --> 00:26:07,141
it comes to an end and then there's a 
period of we might consider it re where 

491
00:26:07,141 --> 00:26:09,360
you reconstitute himself to some degree 
and it's.

492
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,400
That's when he makes his sacrifices.
And it seems to me that it's that 

493
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,800
reconstitution that constitutes the 
worship.

494
00:26:14,801 --> 00:26:16,690
The worship is something like,
you know,

495
00:26:16,691 --> 00:26:19,330
this is alluding back to my original 
proposition,

496
00:26:19,331 --> 00:26:20,230
that it's how you act.

497
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:24,460
That's the issue.
And the worship is the decision to enact

498
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:29,490
the good in whatever form it is that you
can conceptualize it as well as trying 

499
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:32,320
to continually reconceptualize the good 
in a manner that makes the good,

500
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:34,480
that you're conceptualizing even that 
much better.

501
00:26:34,481 --> 00:26:36,550
Right?
Because when you start aiming,

502
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:41,790
the probability that you're going to be 
aiming in the right direction is very 

503
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,821
low,
but hypothetically as you aim and as 

504
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:47,610
practice and as you learn,
the target is going to shift in front of

505
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:51,060
your eyes and you're going to be able to
follow whatever more clearly and so that

506
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:56,061
seems to me,
and especially given the context that 

507
00:26:56,061 --> 00:26:59,411
this word is used in this particular 
story is much more appropriate 

508
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:00,480
interpretation of what constitutes 
proper worship.

509
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:05,481
And I suppose it's akin to the later 
Christian idea that it's the imitation 

510
00:27:05,481 --> 00:27:09,951
of Christ.
That's the sacred duty of every 

511
00:27:09,951 --> 00:27:11,340
Christian,
every Christian and every human being.

512
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,130
I suppose in so far as that's an 
archetypal idea.

513
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,500
An idea is something like,
well,

514
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:21,501
it's the embodiment of the good.
That's the issue and it's not your 

515
00:27:21,501 --> 00:27:26,301
stated belief in the good and you know 
when nature was criticized and 

516
00:27:26,301 --> 00:27:30,081
Christianity.
This is actually one of the things that 

517
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,211
he brought up as a as a major issue.
He said that he believed Christianity 

518
00:27:32,211 --> 00:27:35,361
had lost its way because it had 
introduced a confusion between stated 

519
00:27:35,361 --> 00:27:37,230
belief,
which is say your belief in the divinity

520
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:38,700
of Christ.
Whatever it means.

521
00:27:38,701 --> 00:27:41,160
If you state that it isn't obvious what 
it means,

522
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:46,161
that when you state that because it 
isn't obvious what it would mean that 

523
00:27:46,161 --> 00:27:46,920
you believe it or even what it is that 
you're believing in.

524
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,290
As far as Nietzsche was concerned.
In some sense,

525
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:54,291
not only was that beside the point,
it was dangerously beside the point 

526
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:57,501
because it actually allowed the 
Christian believer not to adopt the 

527
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:03,030
moral burden that was actually 
appropriate to the faith which was to.

528
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,050
And this is.
I'm using a kind of a union concept here

529
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:10,680
to manifest the archetype within the 
confines of your own life.

530
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,280
And that's to make the divine that your 
relationship with the divine,

531
00:28:14,281 --> 00:28:19,281
your relationship with the transcendent 
and infinite into something that's 

532
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,910
actually realized bubble in the context 
of your own life.

533
00:28:20,911 --> 00:28:21,870
Which is to say,
well,

534
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,280
you know,
you're supposed to.

535
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,780
You're supposed to,
again,

536
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:27,150
to act out the highest good of which 
you're capable.

537
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:28,500
Now.
That'll transform your life.

538
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:30,540
To some degree,
into an archetypal adventure,

539
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,640
there is no way around that because as 
you attempt to climb a higher mountain,

540
00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:40,671
let's say,
or to aim at a higher target or 

541
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:42,591
something like that,
then the things around you will become 

542
00:28:42,591 --> 00:28:45,410
increasingly dramatic and of import.
That happens by necessity obviously 

543
00:28:45,511 --> 00:28:49,650
because if you're aiming at something 
difficult and profound and you're really

544
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:54,651
working on it,
then your life is going to become 

545
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:54,651
perhaps increasingly difficult and 
profound,

546
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:55,710
but that might be okay.
You might.

547
00:28:55,711 --> 00:29:00,711
That might be exactly what you need as 
an antidote to the implicit limitations 

548
00:29:00,961 --> 00:29:05,961
that say,
see you as a human being so and I and 

549
00:29:13,991 --> 00:29:16,360
the lad will go yonder and worship and 
come again to you.

550
00:29:16,361 --> 00:29:21,361
Now,
there's an implication here too that 

551
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:24,030
it's a foreshadowing that Abraham 
offering up his son is actually a form 

552
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:28,471
of worship and that's that it's 
continuous with what he's already done 

553
00:29:28,471 --> 00:29:31,210
and well now I'm going to read you some 
of the things that I've written and then

554
00:29:31,211 --> 00:29:33,430
I'll return to this and we'll see how 
that goes.

555
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,330
So

556
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,680
life is suffering.
That's clear.

557
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,070
There is no more basic,
irrefutable truth.

558
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:50,610
It's basically as we've seen what God 
tells Adam and Eve immediately before he

559
00:29:51,371 --> 00:29:55,030
kicks them out of Paradise,
quote unto the woman,

560
00:29:55,031 --> 00:30:00,031
he said,
I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and 

561
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,191
thy conception in sorrow,
thou shall bring forth children and that

562
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:07,471
desire shall be to the husband and he 
shall rule over thee and unto Adam he 

563
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:11,941
said,
because you have hearkened unto the 

564
00:30:11,941 --> 00:30:12,670
voice of thy wife and hast eaten of the 
tree which I commanded thee,

565
00:30:12,671 --> 00:30:14,560
saying,
thou shalt not eat of it.

566
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:19,890
Cursed is the ground for the sake in 
sorrow shall thou eat of it all the days

567
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:25,501
of thy life,
thorns also and thistles shall it bring 

568
00:30:25,501 --> 00:30:26,950
forth to thee and thou shalt eat the 
herb of the field.

569
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:32,310
By the sweat of your brow,
you will eat your food until you return 

570
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:32,310
to the ground.

571
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,490
Since from it you were taken for dust,
you are and to dust,

572
00:30:33,491 --> 00:30:37,650
you will return rough.
You know,

573
00:30:37,651 --> 00:30:42,651
and we've associated that with,
with Adam and Eve's eyes opening and 

574
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:47,730
them becoming self conscious and 
discovering the future and becoming 

575
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:51,331
fully aware and falling into history.
And it seems to me to be a very 

576
00:30:51,331 --> 00:30:54,280
realistic existential portrayal of the 
predicament of humankind.

577
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,340
What in the world should be done about 
that?

578
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,200
The simplest,
most obvious and most direct answer,

579
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,520
pursue pleasure.
Follow your impulses.

580
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,280
Live for the moment.
Do what's expedient.

581
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,960
Lie,
cheat,

582
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:12,070
steal,
deceive,

583
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:17,220
manipulate,
but don't get caught in an ultimately 

584
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,610
meaningless universe.
What possible difference could it make?

585
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,480
And this is by no means a new idea.
The fact of life tragedy and the 

586
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,370
suffering that is part of it has been 
used to justify the pursuit of immediate

587
00:31:27,371 --> 00:31:30,190
selfish gratification for a very long 
time,

588
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,980
no,
even reading young,

589
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,880
he often writes as if before the rise of
the conflict between religion and 

590
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:44,131
science and which culminated say in 
niches pronouncement about the death of 

591
00:31:44,131 --> 00:31:46,510
God,
that people lived ensconced quite safely

592
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:51,511
within a religious conceptualization 
that abused their life with meaning and 

593
00:31:51,511 --> 00:31:52,360
that that was,
and that was just the state of reality,

594
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:57,361
you know,
but there's ancient writings that makes 

595
00:31:57,361 --> 00:31:57,361
it quite clear that the crisis of faith 
that characterize,

596
00:31:57,361 --> 00:32:00,340
say modern people were certainly far 
from unknown in the past.

597
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:05,340
And here's one of those writings.
This is from wisdom to the revised 

598
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:11,310
standard version,
short and sorrowful is our life and 

599
00:32:11,861 --> 00:32:16,861
there is no remedy when a man comes to 
his end and no one has been known to 

600
00:32:16,861 --> 00:32:21,511
return from Haiti's because we were born
by mere chance and hereafter.

601
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:27,270
We shall be as though we had never been 
because the breath in our nostrils is 

602
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:31,591
smoke and reason is just a spark kindled
by the beating of our hearts.

603
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:36,930
When it is extinguished,
our body will turn to ashes and their 

604
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,990
spirit will dissolve like empty air.
Our Name

605
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:43,500
will be forgotten in time and no one 
will remember our works.

606
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:48,501
Our life will pass away like the traces 
of a cloud and be scattered like mist 

607
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:52,911
that is chased by the rays of the sun 
and overcome by its heat for our 

608
00:32:52,911 --> 00:32:57,560
allotted time is about the passing of 
the shadow and there is no return from 

609
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,710
our death because it is sealed up and no
one turns back.

610
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,850
Come.
Therefore,

611
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:08,300
let us enjoy the good things that exist 
and make use of the creation to the 

612
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,330
full.
As in youth.

613
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:14,990
Let us take our fill of costly wines and
perfumes and let know flower of spring 

614
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,740
passes by.
Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds 

615
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,381
before they wither.
Let none of us fail to share in our 

616
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:28,011
revelry everywhere.
Let us leave signs of enjoyment because 

617
00:33:28,011 --> 00:33:30,130
this is our portion and this is our lot.
Let us oppress.

618
00:33:30,131 --> 00:33:31,950
Press the righteous,
poor man.

619
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:36,750
Let us not spare the widow nor regard 
the gray hairs of the aged,

620
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,820
but let her might be are right for what 
is weak proves itself to be useless.

621
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,490
It's an amazing

622
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,660
piece of writing.
You know it.

623
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:53,830
It starts with an announcement of the 
rationale for nihilism and ends with a 

624
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,580
justification for fastest tyranny.
You know,

625
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:57,680
and it's,
it's thousands of years old.

626
00:33:57,681 --> 00:34:00,830
It's,
it's a remarkable thing to see and to be

627
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:05,920
laid out so concisely.
The pleasure of expediency may be 

628
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,060
fleeting,
but it's pleasure nonetheless,

629
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:12,200
and that's something to stack up against
the terror and pain of existence.

630
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:17,350
Every man for himself and the devil.
Take the hindmost as the old proverb has

631
00:34:18,231 --> 00:34:23,231
it.
Why not simply take everything you can 

632
00:34:23,231 --> 00:34:26,261
get whenever the opportunity arises,
why not determined to live in that 

633
00:34:26,261 --> 00:34:30,401
manner?
What's the alternative and why should we

634
00:34:30,691 --> 00:34:35,691
bother with it?
Our ancestors worked out very 

635
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:39,231
sophisticated answers to such questions,
but we still don't understand them very 

636
00:34:39,231 --> 00:34:40,860
well.
This is because they are in large part,

637
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:44,250
still implicit manifest primarily in 
ritual and myth,

638
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:49,730
and as of yet incompletely articulated,
we act them out and represent them in 

639
00:34:50,771 --> 00:34:55,771
stories,
but we're not wise enough yet to 

640
00:34:55,771 --> 00:34:58,321
formulate them explicitly.
We're still chimps in a troop or wolves 

641
00:34:58,321 --> 00:35:00,130
in the pack.
We know how to behave.

642
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:03,580
We know who's who and why.
We've learned that through experience.

643
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:08,350
Our knowledge has been shaped by our 
interaction with others.

644
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,410
We've established predictable routines 
and patterns of behavior,

645
00:35:11,411 --> 00:35:15,160
but we don't really understand them or 
know where they originated.

646
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,330
Maybe evolved over great expanses of 
time.

647
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:24,810
No one was formulating them explicitly,
at least not in the dimmest reaches of 

648
00:35:25,181 --> 00:35:30,181
the past,
even though we've been telling each 

649
00:35:30,181 --> 00:35:31,610
other how to act forever.
One day,

650
00:35:31,611 --> 00:35:32,840
however,
not so long ago,

651
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:35,930
we woke up,
we were already doing,

652
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,040
but we noticing what we

653
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,040
were doing.
We started using our bodies as devices 

654
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,750
to represent their own actions.
We started imitating and dramatizing.

655
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:51,230
We invented ritual.
We started acting out our own 

656
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,830
experiences.
Then we started to tell stories.

657
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:58,490
We coded our observations of our own 
drama in those stories,

658
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,520
in this manner.
The information that was first only 

659
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,100
embedded in our behavior became 
represented in our stories,

660
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,790
but we didn't and we still don't 
understand what it all meant.

661
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:14,190
The Biblical narrative of Paradise in 
the fall is one such story fabricated by

662
00:36:14,191 --> 00:36:17,220
our collective imagination working over 
the centuries.

663
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:24,320
It provides a profound account of the 
nature of being and points the way to a 

664
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,211
motive conceptualization and action well
matched to that nature in the garden of 

665
00:36:29,211 --> 00:36:31,590
Eden prior to the dawn of self 
consciousness,

666
00:36:31,591 --> 00:36:34,710
so goes the story.
Human beings were sinless.

667
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,370
Our primordial parents,
Adam and Eve walked with God.

668
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:49,940
They hadn't attempted by the snake.
The first couple ate from the tree of 

669
00:36:50,281 --> 00:36:55,281
the knowledge of good and evil,
discovered death and vulnerability and 

670
00:36:55,281 --> 00:36:58,731
turned away from God.
Mankind was exiled from paradise and 

671
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:01,830
began it's effortful,
mortal existence,

672
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,890
the idea of sacrifice enter soon 
afterwards,

673
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:09,891
beginning with the account of Cain and 
Abel and developing as we've seen 

674
00:37:09,891 --> 00:37:09,891
through the abrahamic stories,

675
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:16,530
after much contemplation,
struggling humanity learns that God's 

676
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:19,450
favor could be gained and his wrath 
averted through proper sacrifice,

677
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:24,720
and also that bloody murder might be 
motivated among those unwilling or 

678
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,201
unable to succeed in this manner.
When engaging in sacrifice,

679
00:37:29,501 --> 00:37:34,501
our forefathers began to act out what 
would be considered a proposition if it 

680
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:38,431
were stated in words that something 
better might be attained in the future 

681
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:40,570
by giving up something of value in the 
present.

682
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:42,820
Recall,
if you will,

683
00:37:42,821 --> 00:37:47,821
that the necessity for work is one of 
the curses placed by God upon out of 

684
00:37:47,821 --> 00:37:52,001
Man,
his descendants in consequence of 

685
00:37:52,001 --> 00:37:54,631
original sin.
Adam's waking to the fundamental 

686
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:57,980
constraints of his being,
his vulnerability,

687
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,960
his eventual death that's equivalent to 
the discovery of the future.

688
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:07,440
The future.
That's where you go to die.

689
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:13,490
Hopefully not too soon.
Your demise might be staved off through 

690
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:17,871
work,
through the sacrifice of the now to 

691
00:38:17,871 --> 00:38:20,400
benefit later.
It is for this reason,

692
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:25,401
among others,
no doubt that the concept of sacrifice 

693
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:27,961
is introduced in the biblical chapter 
immediately following the drama of the 

694
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:31,281
fall.
There's little difference between 

695
00:38:31,281 --> 00:38:32,580
sacrifice and work.
They're also both uniquely human.

696
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,040
Sometimes animals act as if

697
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,040
they're working,
but they're really only following the 

698
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,920
dictates of their natures.
Beavers build dams.

699
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,160
They do so because they're beavers and 
beavers build dams.

700
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,320
They don't think,
yeah,

701
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:52,560
but I'd rather be on a beach in Mexico 
with my girlfriend while they're doing 

702
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:52,560
it.

703
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:01,670
Prosaically such sacrifice work is delay
of gratification,

704
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:07,460
but that's a very mundane phrase to 
describe something of soul shattering 

705
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:11,721
significance.
The discovery that gratification could 

706
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:14,871
be delayed was simultaneously the 
discovery of time and with it causality 

707
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,780
long ago in the dim mists of time,
we began to realize that reality was 

708
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,620
structured as if it could be bargained 
with.

709
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,310
We learned that behaving properly now in
the present,

710
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,400
regulating our impulses,
considering the plight of others could 

711
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,660
bring rewards in the future in a time 
and place that did not yet exist.

712
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:38,990
We began to inhibit control and organize
our immediate impulses so that we could 

713
00:39:39,301 --> 00:39:44,301
stop interfering with other people and 
our future selves doing so was 

714
00:39:44,471 --> 00:39:47,680
indistinguishable from organizing 
society.

715
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:54,420
The discovery of the causal relationship
between our efforts today and the 

716
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,530
quality of tomorrow motivated the social
contract,

717
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:00,250
the organization that enables today's 
work to be stored reliably,

718
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,920
mostly in the form of promises from 
others.

719
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:09,630
Understanding is something that's often 
acted out before it can be articulated

720
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:16,110
just as a child,
acts out what it means to be mother or 

721
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,040
father before being able to give a 
spoken account of what those roles mean.

722
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,400
The idea,
the act of making a ritual sacrifice to 

723
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,671
God was an early and sophisticated 
enactment of the idea of the usefulness 

724
00:40:27,311 --> 00:40:32,311
of delay.
There is a long conceptual journey 

725
00:40:32,311 --> 00:40:35,791
between merely feasting,
hungrily and learning to set aside some 

726
00:40:35,791 --> 00:40:39,361
extra meat smoke by the fire for the end
of the day or for someone who isn't 

727
00:40:39,361 --> 00:40:43,111
present.
It takes a long time to learn to keep 

728
00:40:43,111 --> 00:40:45,520
anything later for yourself or to share 
it with someone else,

729
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,880
and those are very much the same thing 
as in the former case.

730
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:50,590
You're sharing with your future self.

731
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:57,060
It's much easier and far more likely to 
selfishly and immediately wolf down 

732
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:00,661
everything in sight.
There are similar long journeys between 

733
00:41:00,661 --> 00:41:03,631
every leap and sophistication with 
regards to delay and its 

734
00:41:03,631 --> 00:41:05,950
conceptualization,
short term sharing,

735
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:11,310
storing away from the further future 
representation of that storage in the 

736
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:15,721
form of records and later in the form of
currency and ultimately the saving of 

737
00:41:15,721 --> 00:41:19,651
money in a bank or other institution.
Some conceptualizations had serve as 

738
00:41:19,651 --> 00:41:24,391
intermediaries or the full range of our 
practices and ideas surrounding 

739
00:41:24,391 --> 00:41:26,800
sacrifice and work and their 
representation could have never emerged.

740
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:30,340
Our ancestors acted out a drama,

741
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,850
a literary fiction.
They persona fired the forest,

742
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:38,360
that governance fate as a spirit that 
can be bargained with,

743
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,420
traded with as if it were another human 
being,

744
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:46,510
and the amazing thing is that it worked.
This was in part because the future is 

745
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:51,701
largely composed of other human beings,
often precisely those who have watched 

746
00:41:51,701 --> 00:41:55,190
an evaluated and appraise the tiniest 
details of your past behavior.

747
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:01,060
It's not very far from that to God 
sitting above on high tracking your 

748
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,800
every move and writing it down for 
further reference.

749
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:07,610
In a big book here is a productive,
symbolic idea.

750
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:13,570
The future is a judgmental father.
That's a good start,

751
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,760
but two additional archetype or 
foundational questions that arose 

752
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,661
because of the discovery of sacrifice of
work both have to do with the ultimate 

753
00:42:25,661 --> 00:42:30,071
extension of the logic of work,
which is sacrifice now to gain later.

754
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:38,120
First question,
what must be sacrificed?

755
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,200
Small sacrifices might be sufficient to 
small to solve small singular problems,

756
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:51,620
but it's possible that larger,
more comprehensive sacrifices might 

757
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,450
solve an array of large and complex 
problems all at the same time.

758
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:00,260
That's harder,
but it might be better adapting to the 

759
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,220
necessary discipline of medical school,
for example,

760
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:07,700
will fatally interfere with the 
licentious lifestyle of a hardcore 

761
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,380
undergraduate party animal giving that 
up as a sacrifice,

762
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:13,470
but a physician can.
To quote George,

763
00:43:13,471 --> 00:43:18,471
w really put food on his family that's a
lot of trouble dispensed with over a 

764
00:43:23,251 --> 00:43:28,251
very long period of time,
so sacrifices are necessary to improve 

765
00:43:28,861 --> 00:43:33,180
the future and larger sacrifices can be 
better.

766
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:35,940
Second question,
introduction.

767
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:41,180
We've already established the basic 
principle sacrifice will improve the 

768
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:45,171
future,
but what's implied by that in the most 

769
00:43:45,171 --> 00:43:49,341
extreme and final of cases,
where does that basic principle find its

770
00:43:49,351 --> 00:43:54,351
limits?
We must ask to begin with what would be 

771
00:43:54,351 --> 00:43:55,170
the largest,
most effective,

772
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:59,040
most pleasing of all possible 
sacrifices,

773
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:04,650
and then how good might the best 
possible future be if the most effective

774
00:44:04,651 --> 00:44:09,651
possible sacrifice could be made.
The Biblical story of Cain and Abel,

775
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,520
Adam and Eve sons immediately follows 
the story of the expulsion from 

776
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,730
paradise.
As mentioned previously,

777
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:26,370
Cain and Abel are really the first 
humans since their parents were made 

778
00:44:26,951 --> 00:44:29,320
directly by God and not born in the 
standard manner.

779
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,280
Cain and Abel live in history,
not in Eden.

780
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,760
They must work.
They must make sacrifices to please God 

781
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,010
and they do so with alter and proper 
ritual,

782
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:41,670
but things get complicated.
Ables offerings please God,

783
00:44:41,671 --> 00:44:45,420
but do not able is rewarded many times 
over,

784
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,930
but Kane is not.
It's not precisely clear why,

785
00:44:48,931 --> 00:44:51,750
although the tech strongly hints that 
Keynes Heart is just not in it.

786
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,600
Maybe the quality of what came put 
forward was low.

787
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:59,990
Maybe his spirit was begrudging or maybe
God was just feeding crabby and all of 

788
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:03,060
this is realistic,
including the texts,

789
00:45:03,061 --> 00:45:07,050
vagueness of explanation.
Not all sacrifices are of equal quality.

790
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:12,830
Furthermore,
it often appears that sacrifices of 

791
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:15,471
apparently high quality are sometimes 
not rewarded with a better future and 

792
00:45:15,471 --> 00:45:17,040
it's not clear why.
Why isn't God happy?

793
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,520
What would have to change to make him 
so?

794
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,990
These are difficult questions and 
everyone asks them all the time,

795
00:45:24,991 --> 00:45:26,550
even if they don't notice.

796
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:30,030
Asking such questions is 
indistinguishable from thinking.

797
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:36,950
The realization that pleasure could be 
usefully for stole dormed with a 

798
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:40,161
difficulty that's almost impossible to 
overstate such a realization runs 

799
00:45:41,461 --> 00:45:46,461
absolutely contrary to our ancient 
fundamental animal instincts which 

800
00:45:46,461 --> 00:45:50,871
demand immediate satisfaction,
particularly under conditions of 

801
00:45:50,871 --> 00:45:54,531
deprivation,
which are both inevitable and 

802
00:45:54,531 --> 00:45:54,531
commonplace,
and to complicate the matter,

803
00:45:54,531 --> 00:45:59,450
such delay only becomes useful when 
civilization has stabilized itself 

804
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,890
enough to guarantee the existence of the
delayed reward.

805
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,730
If everything you save will be destroyed
or worse,

806
00:46:04,731 --> 00:46:06,530
stolen,
there's no point saving.

807
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:12,650
It's for this reason that a wolf will 
down 20 pounds of raw meat in a single 

808
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:13,050
meal.
He isn't thinking,

809
00:46:13,051 --> 00:46:14,970
man,
I hate it when I binge.

810
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:17,670
I should save some of this for next 
week.

811
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,630
Here's a developmental progression from 
animal to human.

812
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,940
It's wrong,
no doubt in the details,

813
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:27,930
but it's sufficiently correct for our 
purposes in theme first,

814
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:31,080
there's excess food,
large carcasses,

815
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:34,350
mammoths or other massive herbivores 
might provide that way.

816
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:38,730
A lot of mamas,
maybe all of them with a large animal,

817
00:46:38,731 --> 00:46:43,731
there's some left for later after a kill
that's accidental at first,

818
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:49,550
but eventually the utility of for later 
starts to be appreciated.

819
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,760
Some provisional notion of sacrifice 
develops at the same time.

820
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:57,540
If I leave some now,
even if I want it now,

821
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:02,700
I won't have to be hungry later.
That provision will notion then develops

822
00:47:02,701 --> 00:47:05,340
to the next level.
If I leave some for later,

823
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:10,700
I won't have to go hungry and neither 
will those I care for and then to the 

824
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:13,500
next level.
I can't possibly eat all this mammoth,

825
00:47:13,501 --> 00:47:16,110
but I can't store the rest for too long 
either.

826
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:18,630
Maybe I should feed some to other 
people.

827
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:23,190
Maybe they'll remember and feed me some 
of their mammoth when they have some and

828
00:47:23,191 --> 00:47:28,191
I have none.
Then I'll get some mammoth now and some 

829
00:47:28,191 --> 00:47:29,710
mammoth later.
That's a good deal

830
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,940
and maybe those I'm sharing with will 
come to trust me more generally.

831
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,860
Maybe then we could trade forever in 
such a manner.

832
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:42,520
Mammoth becomes future,
mammoth and future.

833
00:47:42,521 --> 00:47:47,521
Mammoth becomes personal reputation.
That's the emergence of the social 

834
00:47:47,521 --> 00:47:52,471
contract to share does not mean to give 
away something you value and get nothing

835
00:47:53,041 --> 00:47:54,420
back.
That's the only.

836
00:47:54,421 --> 00:47:59,421
Instead what every child who refuses to 
share his afraid that it means to share 

837
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:02,220
means properly to initiate the process 
of trade.

838
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:06,950
A child who can't share,
you can't trade,

839
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:11,210
can't have any friends because having 
friends is a form of trade.

840
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:16,570
Benjamin Franklin once suggested that a 
newcomer to a neighborhood ask a new 

841
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:20,660
neighbor to do him or her a favor citing
an old maxim.

842
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:26,050
He that has one stun you.
A kindness will be more ready to do 

843
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:29,500
another.
Then he whom you yourself have obliged 

844
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,740
in Franklin,
so opinion asking something for someone,

845
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:36,100
asking someone for something not too 
extreme obviously was the most useful 

846
00:48:36,441 --> 00:48:38,750
and immediate invitation to social 
interaction.

847
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:42,800
Such asking allowed the neighbor to show
him or herself as a good person at first

848
00:48:42,801 --> 00:48:47,801
encounter.
It also meant that the neighbor could 

849
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:50,501
now ask the newcomer for a favor in 
return because of the debt incurred in 

850
00:48:50,501 --> 00:48:55,271
that manner,
both parties could overcome their 

851
00:48:55,271 --> 00:48:55,370
natural hesitancy and mutual fear of the
stranger.

852
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:00,090
It's better to have something rather 
than nothing.

853
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:06,600
It's better yet to generously share the 
something you have.

854
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:08,490
It's even better than that.
However,

855
00:49:08,491 --> 00:49:11,310
to become widely known for generous 
sharing,

856
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:15,420
that's something that lasts.
That's something that's reliable,

857
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:20,900
and at this point in abstraction,
we can observe how the groundwork for 

858
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,280
the conceptions of reliable,
honest and generous have been laid.

859
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,880
The basis for an articulated morality 
has been put in place.

860
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:32,120
The productive truthful sharer is the 
prototype for the good citizen and the 

861
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:36,921
good man we can see in this manner how 
from the simple notion that leftovers 

862
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:43,250
are a good idea,
the highest moral principles might 

863
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,491
emerge.
It's as if something like this happened 

864
00:49:46,491 --> 00:49:51,211
as humanity developed first.
We're the endless tens or hundreds of 

865
00:49:53,621 --> 00:49:57,040
thousands of years prior to the 
emergence of written history and drama.

866
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,720
During this time,
the twin practices of delay and exchange

867
00:50:01,721 --> 00:50:06,721
began to emerge slowly and painfully.
Then they became represented in 

868
00:50:07,181 --> 00:50:12,181
metaphorical abstraction as rituals and 
tales of sacrifice totaled in a manner 

869
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:17,791
such as this.
It's as if there is a powerful figure in

870
00:50:18,221 --> 00:50:23,221
the sky who sees all and is judging you,
giving up something you value seems to 

871
00:50:25,331 --> 00:50:30,331
make them happy and you to make them 
happy because all hell breaks loose if 

872
00:50:30,331 --> 00:50:35,201
you don't,
so practice sacrificing and sharing 

873
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:39,260
until you become expert at it and things
will go well for you.

874
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,380
No one said any of this,
at least not so plainly and directly,

875
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:47,160
but it was implicit in the practice and 
then in the stories.

876
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:52,430
Action came first as it had to,
as the animals we once were,

877
00:50:53,101 --> 00:50:58,101
could act but could not think.
Implicit unrecognized value came first 

878
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,830
as the actions that proceeded thought

879
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:07,230
embodied value,
but did not make that value explicit.

880
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:13,070
People watched the successful succeed 
and the unsuccessful fail for thousands 

881
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:18,471
and thousands of years.
We thought it over and we drew a 

882
00:51:18,471 --> 00:51:22,491
conclusion.
The successful among us delay 

883
00:51:22,491 --> 00:51:25,200
gratification,
the successful among us bargain with the

884
00:51:25,201 --> 00:51:28,420
future.
A great idea began to emerge taking ever

885
00:51:28,421 --> 00:51:33,210
more clearly articulated forum in 
evermore clearly articulated stories.

886
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:37,500
What's the difference between the 
successful and the unsuccessful,

887
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:43,670
the successful sacrifice things get 
better as the successful practice,

888
00:51:44,191 --> 00:51:49,191
their sacrifices,
the questions become increasingly 

889
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:52,881
precise and simultaneously broader.
What's the greatest possible sacrifice 

890
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:57,920
for the greatest possible good and the 
answer become increasingly deeper and 

891
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,781
profound.
The God of western tradition like so 

892
00:52:02,781 --> 00:52:05,100
many gods requires sacrifice.
We've already examined why,

893
00:52:05,101 --> 00:52:09,720
but sometimes he goes even further.
He demands not only sacrifice,

894
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:13,140
but the sacrifice of precisely what is 
love best.

895
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:18,320
This is most starkly portrayed and most 
confusingly evident in the story of 

896
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:23,040
Abraham and Isaac.
Abraham beloved of God long wanted a son

897
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:28,220
and God promised them exactly that after
many delays and under the apparently 

898
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:30,960
impossible conditions of old age and the
long barren wife,

899
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:37,070
but not so long afterward,
when the miraculously born,

900
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:42,071
Isaac is still a child.
God turns around and in apparently 

901
00:52:42,071 --> 00:52:44,030
barbaric fashion demands that is 
faithful servant,

902
00:52:44,031 --> 00:52:47,990
offer his son as a sacrifice.
The story ends happily.

903
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:53,830
God sends an angel to stay Abraham's 
obedient hand and accepts a ram and 

904
00:52:53,881 --> 00:52:56,210
Isaac stead.
Now it's a good thing,

905
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:59,180
but it doesn't really address the issue 
at hand.

906
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:03,350
Why was God's going further necessary?
Why does he?

907
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:07,400
Why does life impose such demands?

908
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:16,730
Let's start our analysis with a truism 
stark self evident and understated.

909
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:25,950
Sometimes things do not go well that to 
have much to do with the terrible nature

910
00:53:27,391 --> 00:53:32,391
of the world with its plagues and it's 
famines and it's tyrannies and it's 

911
00:53:32,391 --> 00:53:32,910
betrayals,
but here's the rub.

912
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,400
Sometimes when things are not going 
well,

913
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:40,401
it's not the world that it's the cause.
The cause is instead that which is most 

914
00:53:40,401 --> 00:53:41,790
valued.
Why?

915
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,800
Because the world is revealed to an 
intermittent degree through the template

916
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:51,801
of your values.
If the world you are seeing is not the 

917
00:53:51,801 --> 00:53:56,331
world you want,
therefore it's time to examine your 

918
00:53:56,331 --> 00:53:59,961
values.
It's time to rid yourself of your 

919
00:53:59,961 --> 00:54:01,890
current presuppositions.
It's time to let go.

920
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:07,760
It might even be time to sacrifice what 
you love best so that you can become who

921
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:12,720
you might become instead of staying who 
you are,

922
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:19,910
something valuable given up.
Insurers fused future prosperity,

923
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:21,940
something valuable,
sacrificed,

924
00:54:21,941 --> 00:54:26,941
pleases the Lord.
What is most valuable and best 

925
00:54:26,941 --> 00:54:29,480
sacrificed or what does at least 
emblematic of that,

926
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:33,110
a choice cut of meat,
the best animal in a flock,

927
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:38,330
a most valued possession.
What's above even that something 

928
00:54:39,461 --> 00:54:44,461
intensely personal and painful to give 
up that symbolized perhaps in God's 

929
00:54:44,461 --> 00:54:47,950
insistence on circumcision as part of 
Abraham sacrificial routine.

930
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:53,160
What's beyond that?
What pertains more closely to the whole 

931
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,301
person rather than the part?
What constitutes the ultimate sacrifice 

932
00:54:57,301 --> 00:54:58,720
for the gain of the ultimate prize?

933
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,430
It's a close race between child and 
self.

934
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:10,580
The sacrifice of the mother offering her
child to the world is exemplified.

935
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:12,590
For example,
by Michelangelo,

936
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,190
great sculpture,
the Pieta,

937
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:18,030
Michelangelo Crafted Mary Contemplating 
Her Son,

938
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,430
crucified in ruins,
so she's sitting.

939
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:25,020
Most of you know this sculpture.
She's sitting and the body of her son is

940
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:26,280
in her arms,
her adult son,

941
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:31,281
and it's broken and he's been destroyed 
and it's a very beautiful but very 

942
00:55:31,321 --> 00:55:32,070
tragic

943
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:37,150
work of genius work of genius level 
representation.

944
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:41,620
Michelangelo crafted Mary Contemplating 
Her Son,

945
00:55:41,621 --> 00:55:44,470
crucified and rude.
It's her fault.

946
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,970
It was through her that he entered the 
world and it's great drama of Ba.

947
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:53,170
Is it right to bring a baby into this 
terrible world?

948
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,890
Every woman asks herself that question.
Some say no,

949
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,560
and they have their reasons.
Mary answers,

950
00:55:59,561 --> 00:56:04,561
yes,
voluntarily knowing full well what's to 

951
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:06,841
come as do all mothers if they allow 
themselves to see it's an act of supreme

952
00:56:06,851 --> 00:56:09,520
courage when it's undertaken 
voluntarily.

953
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:15,330
In turn,
Mary Sung Christ offers himself to God 

954
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,271
and the world to be trailed,
torture and death to the very point of 

955
00:56:18,271 --> 00:56:21,010
despair on the cross where he cries out 
those terrible words,

956
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:25,690
my God,
my why hast thou forsaken me?

957
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:32,100
That is the archetipal story of the man 
who gives his all for the sake of the 

958
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:36,001
better,
who offers up his life for the 

959
00:56:36,001 --> 00:56:38,131
advancement of being who allows God's 
will to become manifest fully within the

960
00:56:38,231 --> 00:56:40,420
confines of a single mortal life.

961
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:44,710
That is the model for the honorable man 
in Christ case.

962
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:47,320
However,
as he sacrifices himself,

963
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,860
God,
his father is simultaneously sacrificing

964
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:55,980
his son.
It's for this reason that the Christian 

965
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:58,540
sacrificial drama of Sun and self is 
archetipal.

966
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:02,170
It's a story at the limit where nothing 
more extreme,

967
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:07,410
nothing greater can be imagined.
That's the very definition of 

968
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:10,681
archetypical.
That's the core of what constitutes 

969
00:57:10,681 --> 00:57:13,381
religious pain and suffering.
Define the world of that.

970
00:57:14,171 --> 00:57:19,171
There can be no doubt.
Sacrifice can hold pain and suffering in

971
00:57:20,201 --> 00:57:25,201
a balance to a greater or lesser degree,
and greater sacrifices can do that more 

972
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:30,520
effectively than lesser of that too.
There can be no doubt.

973
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:33,130
Everyone holds this knowledge in their 
soul,

974
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:38,380
thus the person who wishes to alleviate 
suffering,

975
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,930
who wishes to rectify the flaws and 
being who wishes to bring about the best

976
00:57:43,931 --> 00:57:48,310
of all possible futures,
who wants to create heaven on earth will

977
00:57:48,311 --> 00:57:53,311
make the greatest of sacrifices of self 
and child of everything that is loved to

978
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:59,020
live a life aimed at the good he will 
forego expediency.

979
00:57:59,830 --> 00:58:04,830
He will pursue the path of ultimate 
meaning and he will in that manner bring

980
00:58:06,291 --> 00:58:09,280
salvation to the ever desperate world.

981
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:23,710
Thanks.

982
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,960
On the third day,
Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the 

983
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:33,960
place far off.

984
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:38,770
It's not an accident also did in the 
mountain,

985
00:58:38,771 --> 00:58:41,080
right?
Because a mountain is something you have

986
00:58:41,081 --> 00:58:46,081
to climb and you have to climb to the 
pinnacle of a mountain and the mountain 

987
00:58:46,081 --> 00:58:46,081
is operate in.
The mountain,

988
00:58:46,081 --> 00:58:50,971
stretches up to heaven,
and it's a long journey to specify the 

989
00:58:50,971 --> 00:58:54,451
right place on the highest pinnacle,
and that's symbolic because of course 

990
00:58:54,761 --> 00:58:57,250
it's a pinnacle that you're always 
trying to reach.

991
00:58:57,251 --> 00:59:00,280
Just like you're always trying to aim.
You're always trying to climb upward.

992
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:03,730
At least that's the theory,
depends to some degree of course on your

993
00:59:03,731 --> 00:59:08,110
definition of upward.
And Abraham said to his young men,

994
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:13,140
abide he here with us and I and the lad 
will go yonder and worship and come to 

995
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:17,491
you again.
And Abraham took the wood of the burnt 

996
00:59:17,491 --> 00:59:19,540
offering and laid it upon Isaac,
his son,

997
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:25,050
and he took the fire in hand and a knife
and they went both of them together and 

998
00:59:29,551 --> 00:59:32,070
Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and 
said,

999
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,070
my father.
And he said,

1000
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:39,310
here are my my son.
And he said,

1001
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:44,970
behold the fire in the wood,
but where is the lamb for a burnt 

1002
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:49,550
offering?
And Abraham said,

1003
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:54,640
my son,
God will provide himself a lamb for a 

1004
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,970
burnt offering.
So they went both of them together

1005
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:59,770
and they came to the place which God had
told him of,

1006
00:59:59,771 --> 01:00:04,771
and Abraham built an altar there and 
laid the wood in order and bound Isaac 

1007
01:00:04,771 --> 01:00:07,690
his son,
and laid him on the alter upon the wood.

1008
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:14,850
And Abraham stretched forth his hand and
took the knife to slay his son.

1009
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:24,640
And the angel of the Lord called unto 
him out of Heaven and said Abraham.

1010
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,310
And he said,
here am I.

1011
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:31,090
and the Angel said,
lay not dine.

1012
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,680
Hand upon the lad.
Neither do thou anything unto him.

1013
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:35,960
For now I know that Thou [inaudible] 
God.

1014
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:40,160
Seeing thou has not withheld thy son an 
only son from me.

1015
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,800
When I was answering the questions last 
night at this q and a,

1016
01:00:52,801 --> 01:00:57,801
this guy asked me this question.
He said that he had parents who were 

1017
01:00:57,801 --> 01:01:01,730
desperate,
anti social alcoholic addicted 

1018
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:06,140
friendless,
and that they didn't want him to leave 

1019
01:01:06,821 --> 01:01:11,821
their home.
He was the only relationship they had 

1020
01:01:11,821 --> 01:01:15,240
that that was up.
He was the only relationship they had 

1021
01:01:16,751 --> 01:01:21,751
and he asked what he should do and I 
told him that he should leave,

1022
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:29,320
and the reason for that is that you have
a moral obligation as a parent too.

1023
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,390
Encourage your child to go out into the 
world,

1024
01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:41,630
right,
and to be whoever they can be to be the 

1025
01:01:41,821 --> 01:01:46,570
best they can possibly be.
And in doing that you're offering,

1026
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:50,830
you're encouraging them to pursue the 
good.

1027
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:56,040
You're sacrificing them to the good.
You're not keeping them for yourself 

1028
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:59,740
selfishly.
You're telling them that they can go out

1029
01:01:59,741 --> 01:02:01,780
and live their life and live it 
properly.

1030
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:06,960
And,
and that's the parallel to the idea of 

1031
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:13,890
the sacrifice of Isaac as far as I can 
tell you don't want for your son what it

1032
01:02:18,041 --> 01:02:19,440
is that you want him,

1033
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:25,610
you want for your son.
What would be best for him and for the 

1034
01:02:25,651 --> 01:02:30,651
world,
and you let go in precise proportion to 

1035
01:02:31,291 --> 01:02:34,920
your desire to have that happen.
You know the psychoanalysts,

1036
01:02:34,921 --> 01:02:37,040
the great psychoanalyst,
psychoanalyst,

1037
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,900
I think this is actually Freud's dictum,
but I'm not certain of that.

1038
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:45,230
He said the good mother fails,
which is a bit of brilliant observation 

1039
01:02:45,331 --> 01:02:50,331
because when you have an infant do you 
do everything for the infant because the

1040
01:02:51,151 --> 01:02:53,430
infant can do nothing for him or 
herself,

1041
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:58,490
but as the infant matures and this 
increasingly capable of doing things for

1042
01:02:59,461 --> 01:03:01,110
him or herself,
then you pull back,

1043
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:06,111
right?
You pull back and every time the child 

1044
01:03:06,111 --> 01:03:09,290
develops the ability to do something,
you allow them or encourage them to do 

1045
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:10,290
it and you don't interfere.
You know?

1046
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,240
So if your child is struggling,
getting dressed,

1047
01:03:12,241 --> 01:03:14,580
well obviously there's some times that 
you helped them,

1048
01:03:14,581 --> 01:03:19,581
but mostly you let them learn so that 
they can know how to do it in the 

1049
01:03:19,581 --> 01:03:19,680
future.
That's better for you.

1050
01:03:19,681 --> 01:03:24,681
And it's certainly better for them.
There's a rule if you're working with 

1051
01:03:24,681 --> 01:03:25,470
the elderly and an old age home and the 
rule is something like,

1052
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:27,810
oh,
don't do anything for any of the.

1053
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:34,300
For any of the guests,
let's say that they can do for 

1054
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:35,930
themselves because you compromise their 
independence.

1055
01:03:35,931 --> 01:03:40,931
And so as a mother,
you pull back and you pull back and you 

1056
01:03:40,931 --> 01:03:43,811
let your child hit him or herself 
against the world and you fail to 

1057
01:03:43,811 --> 01:03:46,130
protect them,
but by failing to protect them,

1058
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:51,160
you encourage and enable them to the 
point where you're no longer necessary.

1059
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:57,850
Now,
they may still want to see you and it 

1060
01:03:57,850 --> 01:03:57,920
would be wonderful if that was the case,
but the point is is that you're supposed

1061
01:03:57,921 --> 01:04:02,921
to remove yourself from the equation by 
encouraging your child to be the best 

1062
01:04:03,471 --> 01:04:08,471
possible person that person can be,
and you sacrifice your desires,

1063
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,370
all of your desires to that,
your personal desires,

1064
01:04:13,371 --> 01:04:18,371
even your desires for your child in 
relationship to you because you want 

1065
01:04:18,371 --> 01:04:19,940
them to move forward into the world as a
light,

1066
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:21,650
right?
As a light on a hill.

1067
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:23,930
That's what you want.
If you have any sense,

1068
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:28,310
and so you don't get to keep your 
children at home because you need them.

1069
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:33,610
Now I'm talking generally obviously,
and there are circumstances under which 

1070
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:35,510
families make their own idiosyncratic 
decisions.

1071
01:04:35,511 --> 01:04:40,340
And I'm not trying to damn everyone with
a with a casual gesture,

1072
01:04:40,341 --> 01:04:42,790
you know,
but the point is still strong that

1073
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:50,630
the good father is precisely someone who
is willing to sacrifice this child to 

1074
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:54,050
the ultimate good that's dramatized in 
this store,

1075
01:04:54,051 --> 01:04:55,910
you know,
and it's brutal,

1076
01:04:56,630 --> 01:05:01,630
but the world is a brutal place and much
wisdom comes out of catastrophe and this

1077
01:05:04,891 --> 01:05:09,870
is an indication of how much catastrophe
our ancestors had to plow through,

1078
01:05:09,871 --> 01:05:14,871
had to work through in order to generate
the substructure for the conceptions of 

1079
01:05:14,871 --> 01:05:16,770
freedom even that we have today for 
freedom and the.

1080
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:20,320
And that's how the story appears to me.
Now.

1081
01:05:20,321 --> 01:05:23,290
I think there's more to it.
I think if there has to be more to it,

1082
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:28,210
it lays the groundwork,
at least in the Christian context,

1083
01:05:28,211 --> 01:05:32,710
for the eventual emergence of Christ.
As I alluded to in my reading.

1084
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:38,730
That story obviously has to be unpacked 
and unpacked and unpacked just like it 

1085
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:41,260
has been for the last 2000 years.
It's also an indication here of,

1086
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:50,820
well I would say the transmutation of 
sacrifice into an increasingly 

1087
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:54,091
psychological forum,
which is a development that we've 

1088
01:05:54,091 --> 01:05:54,091
tracked all the way through the Old 
Testament,

1089
01:05:54,091 --> 01:05:57,500
up to this particular point.
First act it out,

1090
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:01,370
then represented in ritual.
Those would be the rituals of sacrifice.

1091
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:06,790
Then laid out in story then turned into 
a psychological phenomena so that now 

1092
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:10,850
we're capable of making sacrifices in 
abstraction,

1093
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:15,880
right,
to conceptualize a future that we want 

1094
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,170
to let go of the things that are 
stopping us from moving forward and to 

1095
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:24,101
free ourselves from the chains of our 
original preconceptions and that's laid 

1096
01:06:24,101 --> 01:06:28,280
out in these old stories as the optimal 
pathway of being

1097
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:32,150
and there's a philosopher of science 
named Karl Popper,

1098
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:37,660
very sensible and down to earth person 
who was talking about thinking and it's 

1099
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:41,891
nature,
and he was thought about thinking in a 

1100
01:06:41,891 --> 01:06:41,891
Darwinian fashion.
He said,

1101
01:06:41,891 --> 01:06:45,701
the purpose of thinking is too late.
Your thoughts die instead of you so 

1102
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:48,380
brilliant notion,
and so the idea is something like that.

1103
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:53,180
You can conjure up a representation of 
yourself.

1104
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:58,210
You can conjure up a variety of 
potential representations of yourself 

1105
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:01,721
into the in the future.
You can lay out how those future 

1106
01:07:01,721 --> 01:07:04,310
representations of yourself are likely 
to prevail or fail.

1107
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:09,430
You can call the potential use in the 
future that will fail and then you can 

1108
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:14,171
embody the ones that will succeed.
You do that well simultaneously 

1109
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:20,470
conjuring up a representation of your 
current state and determining for 

1110
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:24,371
yourself because of your undo suffering,
which elements of your pathetic being 

1111
01:07:24,861 --> 01:07:29,861
needed to be given up so that you can 
move forward into that future and the 

1112
01:07:29,861 --> 01:07:34,091
goal.
What is it that you're aiming at with 

1113
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:34,700
that work and that sacrifice?
That's the ultimate question.

1114
01:07:34,701 --> 01:07:36,800
It's the question I was trying to 
address in that writing.

1115
01:07:36,801 --> 01:07:41,801
What is it that you're trying to do?
What you're trying to improve the 

1116
01:07:41,801 --> 01:07:41,801
future?

1117
01:07:41,801 --> 01:07:42,800
We believe that the future can be 
improved.

1118
01:07:42,801 --> 01:07:46,640
We believed that it can be improved as a
consequence of our sacrificial work,

1119
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:49,220
and so once again,
what are the limitations?

1120
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:51,710
What are the limits to that?
What are the necessary limits to that?

1121
01:07:51,711 --> 01:07:54,680
I would say we don't know.
I would say as well that that's actually

1122
01:07:54,681 --> 01:07:59,681
something that the entire Corpus of 
biblical stories is trying desperately 

1123
01:07:59,681 --> 01:08:01,430
to articulate,
to figure out and articulate,

1124
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:02,450
right?
We,

1125
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:03,200
we,
we,

1126
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:06,980
we conjured up this remarkable idea.
The future exists.

1127
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,350
We can see it even though it's only 
potential.

1128
01:08:09,470 --> 01:08:14,470
We can adjust our behavior in the 
present in order to maximize our 

1129
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:17,060
probability of success in the future.
How best to do that?

1130
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:19,550
Well,
the idea is something like,

1131
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:25,950
don't hesitate to offer the ultimate 
sacrifice if you want the future to turn

1132
01:08:28,731 --> 01:08:33,731
out ultimately.
Well now obviously that idea is clothed 

1133
01:08:34,701 --> 01:08:38,030
in metaphysical speculation and 
religious imagery,

1134
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:41,150
but it still remains an intensely 
practical issue,

1135
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:46,570
right?
What is it that you could contract for?

1136
01:08:50,070 --> 01:08:55,070
Let's say if you were willing to give up
everything about you that's weak and 

1137
01:08:55,321 --> 01:09:00,321
unworthy.
The,

1138
01:09:06,790 --> 01:09:11,460
there's a,
there's a continual hints of that in the

1139
01:09:11,461 --> 01:09:12,420
Old Testament,
right?

1140
01:09:12,421 --> 01:09:14,760
Because what happens with no of course 
is that

1141
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:20,110
he establishes the proper covenant with 
God,

1142
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:23,170
the proper contract with being,
let's say,

1143
01:09:23,171 --> 01:09:26,710
and thrives as a consequence,
and then Abraham does the same thing.

1144
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:31,030
There's a strong intimation that that's 
how the world is set right now.

1145
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:36,120
That idea develops and magnifies as the 
stories progress into something like 

1146
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:41,890
into something like the concept of 
heaven on earth.

1147
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:48,990
The notion being that the proper 
sacrificial additude produces a 

1148
01:09:51,281 --> 01:09:55,390
psychological state and then the social 
state.

1149
01:09:55,420 --> 01:10:00,420
That's a manifestation of that attitude 
that decreases the probability that the 

1150
01:10:01,481 --> 01:10:06,481
world will careen into hell and 
increases the probability that people 

1151
01:10:06,641 --> 01:10:11,641
will live high quality,
meaningful private lives in a society 

1152
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:17,341
that's balanced and capable of 
supporting that and none of that seems 

1153
01:10:17,341 --> 01:10:17,590
to me to be

1154
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:21,810
questionable.
Really.

1155
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:26,070
I also don't think it's anything that 
people don't actually know.

1156
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:30,540
You know,
people have told me many times that when

1157
01:10:30,541 --> 01:10:34,140
they listened to me talk,
they're hearing things that they already

1158
01:10:34,141 --> 01:10:36,240
know knew,
but didn't know how to say.

1159
01:10:36,241 --> 01:10:41,241
It's something like that,
and this is one of those things that I 

1160
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:41,241
think is exactly like that.
I mean,

1161
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:45,890
I think it's at the very core of our 
moral knowledge and which is our 

1162
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:45,900
behavioral knowledge and our perceptual 
knowledge.

1163
01:10:45,901 --> 01:10:47,040
I mean,
let's get this straight.

1164
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:52,250
Moral knowledge is no trivial matter.
It's knowledge about how it is that you 

1165
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:55,371
orient yourself in the world.
There's no more profoundly necessary 

1166
01:10:55,371 --> 01:10:55,371
form of knowledge.
Well,

1167
01:10:55,371 --> 01:10:57,900
it's predicated on on something that's 
exactly like this.

1168
01:10:58,110 --> 01:11:03,110
We know that we have to make sacrifices.
We know that we have to aim at what's 

1169
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:06,351
good,
so then why isn't that we don't aim at 

1170
01:11:06,351 --> 01:11:08,841
what's best and make the sacrifices that
are necessary in order to bring that 

1171
01:11:08,841 --> 01:11:12,321
into play.
I think it seems to me that in some 

1172
01:11:12,321 --> 01:11:14,040
sense that's self.
The question

1173
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:19,040
is why we don't do it,
but there's answers to that to already 

1174
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,310
in the material that we've covered.
Life is hard and it hurts people.

1175
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:25,870
It's rife with limitation and some of 
it's arbitrary and it's no wonder and 

1176
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,350
some of it's unjust and some of its 
worst.

1177
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:33,351
Some of it's malevolent,
which is even worse than something I 

1178
01:11:33,351 --> 01:11:33,351
haven't talked about at all in this 
lecture.

1179
01:11:33,351 --> 01:11:38,030
It's not surprising that that 
combination of vicissitude can turn 

1180
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:41,271
people against being,
but I think even when that happens and 

1181
01:11:41,271 --> 01:11:44,481
even when people have the kind of 
history that if they revealed to you,

1182
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:47,070
you would say,
well,

1183
01:11:47,071 --> 01:11:52,071
it's no wonder you turned out that way.
The people who turn out that way still 

1184
01:11:52,171 --> 01:11:57,171
know that it's wrong.
They still know that however deep their 

1185
01:11:57,171 --> 01:11:57,930
own suffering,
however arbitrary their own suffering,

1186
01:11:58,170 --> 01:12:01,200
however much that's caused by the 
malevolence of others,

1187
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:06,320
as well as the tragedy of existence,
that that does not in any way justify 

1188
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:11,241
they're turning away from the good and I
believe everyone knows that I believe 

1189
01:12:12,811 --> 01:12:17,811
that they know it implicitly,
even if they don't allow themselves to 

1190
01:12:17,811 --> 01:12:20,790
know what explicitly and I believe that 
if they violate that idea,

1191
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:24,480
then they violate themselves and that 
they end up in cains position,

1192
01:12:24,481 --> 01:12:29,481
which is the position of the man who's 
been given a punishment that is too 

1193
01:12:29,481 --> 01:12:29,481
great to bear,

1194
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,680
and the angel said,

1195
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:39,400
thank you

1196
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:41,750
les,
not dying.

1197
01:12:41,751 --> 01:12:44,810
Hand upon the loud.
Neither do without anything unto him.

1198
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:50,650
For now I know that Thou [inaudible] God
seeing thou has not withheld thy son.

1199
01:12:53,341 --> 01:12:58,341
They only son from me and Abraham lifted
up his eyes and looked and behold behind

1200
01:13:01,111 --> 01:13:06,111
him,
a ram caught in the thicket body has 

1201
01:13:06,111 --> 01:13:08,661
thorns by his horns and Abraham went and
took the ram and offered him up for a 

1202
01:13:09,601 --> 01:13:14,601
burnt offering instead of his son and 
Abraham called the name of that place.

1203
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:22,830
Jehovah Zero.
As it is said to this day in the mount 

1204
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:27,751
of the Lord,
it shall be seat and the angel of the 

1205
01:13:28,401 --> 01:13:33,401
Lord called Unto Abraham Out of heaven 
the second time and said by myself,

1206
01:13:34,551 --> 01:13:38,510
have I sworn Sayeth the Lord for because
Thou hast done this thing and it has not

1207
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:43,810
withheld thy son die.
And only son that in blessing I will 

1208
01:13:43,941 --> 01:13:48,941
bless thee.
And in multiplying I will multiply thy 

1209
01:13:48,941 --> 01:13:53,081
seed as the stars of the heaven and as 
the sand which is upon the seashore and 

1210
01:13:53,081 --> 01:13:55,730
thy seed shall possess the gates of his 
gate of his enemies.

1211
01:13:56,750 --> 01:14:01,750
And in thy seed shall all the nations of
the Earth be blessed because thou hast 

1212
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:03,140
obeyed my voice.

1213
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:12,110
So Abraham

1214
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:15,560
returned unto his young men and they 
rose up and went together to Beersheba.

1215
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:20,830
And Abraham dwelled had Beersheba and it
came to pass after these things that it 

1216
01:14:22,051 --> 01:14:25,530
was told Abraham saying,
behold,

1217
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,920
milka she has also born children unto 
thy brother [inaudible] whore.

1218
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:35,750
And Sarah was 107 and 20 years old.
Those were the years of the life of 

1219
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:37,410
Sarah and Sarah died,
encourage,

1220
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:42,460
uh,
the same as Hebrew in the land of 

1221
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:45,381
Canaan.
And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and 

1222
01:14:45,381 --> 01:14:49,591
to weep for her.
Well,

1223
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:25,970
I don't exactly know what to do now 
because of that.

1224
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:45,710
I'll review what we've,
what we've covered,

1225
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:52,090
and then I'll bring this to a close.
We can have some more questions than 

1226
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:55,601
would be usual tonight.
So what have we established by this 

1227
01:15:58,701 --> 01:16:03,701
point?
The stories that have been revealed so 

1228
01:16:04,771 --> 01:16:09,771
far or something like that contain the 
idea that there's something divine 

1229
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:21,470
that's a now I guess to the human 
capacity for communication and 

1230
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:23,600
attention.
That's APP the,

1231
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:26,810
that operates at the genesis of being 
itself.

1232
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:31,730
That's the initial account in the Old 
Testament.

1233
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:38,890
It's an account that places the role of 
spirit centrally in the,

1234
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:45,550
in the nature of being.
I'm not exactly sure what to make of 

1235
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:50,171
that because in some ways I miss 
materialistically oriented as modern 

1236
01:16:50,691 --> 01:16:55,691
people typically are,
but the stories make sense to me in many

1237
01:16:55,851 --> 01:17:00,851
ways.
The idea that there's something world 

1238
01:17:01,401 --> 01:17:06,401
creating about human consciousness and 
that that's a canned in some sense to 

1239
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:10,040
the divine force that called order out 
of

1240
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:15,040
chaos at the beginning of time seems to 
me to be a very powerful metaphysical 

1241
01:17:15,111 --> 01:17:20,111
idea and it also seems to me to be an 
idea that is immovable.

1242
01:17:20,171 --> 01:17:25,171
He out the foundation of Western culture
because our entire legal system,

1243
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:28,820
our society,
our expect,

1244
01:17:28,821 --> 01:17:33,530
mutual expectations,
all of that are conditioned to the final

1245
01:17:33,531 --> 01:17:38,531
degree by our presupposition that each 
of us has an intrinsic value that 

1246
01:17:40,881 --> 01:17:45,881
transcends the local conditions of our 
being and it's with that presupposition 

1247
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:52,871
that we've been able to establish the 
society that functions as a society that

1248
01:17:53,271 --> 01:17:58,271
functions and functions well and it has 
its current characterization and that's 

1249
01:17:58,581 --> 01:18:03,581
a non.
It's an unlikely occurrence and it's a 

1250
01:18:03,581 --> 01:18:06,470
nontrivial reality and I don't see any 
way out of that.

1251
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:13,560
We out of that conclusion,
I don't see anything that that can 

1252
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,831
easily be replaced with and so god calls
being into order,

1253
01:18:19,411 --> 01:18:24,411
into being out of chaos at the beginning
of time and attributes to human beings 

1254
01:18:24,411 --> 01:18:28,571
the same essential capacity,
and we turn to Adam and eve in the 

1255
01:18:28,571 --> 01:18:29,510
garden and they're unconscious by all 
appearances,

1256
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:34,640
allied tightly with God but unconscious.
They don't seem aware of the future.

1257
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:39,700
They don't seem aware of themselves.
They don't seem aware of their own 

1258
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:39,700
vulnerability.

1259
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,920
They make the fatal error of having 
their eyes open.

1260
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:49,250
They discover their own vulnerability.
They also discovered their capacity for 

1261
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:51,000
evil.
We reviewed that to some degree.

1262
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:57,080
What's the association?
Because it's the tree of the knowledge 

1263
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,040
of good and evil,
the fruit of which they eat.

1264
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:04,760
What's the association between the 
discovery of vulnerability and the 

1265
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:08,181
emergence of moral knowledge?
It's something like as far as I can 

1266
01:19:08,181 --> 01:19:11,991
tell,
that you actually don't know how to be 

1267
01:19:11,991 --> 01:19:14,721
evil or to be good until you're actually
aware of consciously have your own 

1268
01:19:14,721 --> 01:19:18,741
vulnerability because the essence of 
evil is the exploitation of 

1269
01:19:18,741 --> 01:19:22,671
vulnerability.
Perhaps for the sake of that 

1270
01:19:22,671 --> 01:19:25,671
exploitation and I can't understand how 
to hurt someone until I know exactly how

1271
01:19:27,181 --> 01:19:32,181
I can be hurt myself and I can't 
understand how I can be hurt myself 

1272
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:35,220
until I become cognizant of my mortal 
limitations too,

1273
01:19:35,221 --> 01:19:40,221
until I understand what brings me pain,
until I understand the suffering that 

1274
01:19:40,221 --> 01:19:41,910
goes along with my mortal limitations,
my,

1275
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:46,710
my inevitable death and the suffering 
that goes along with that and with the,

1276
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:52,140
with the accrual of the knowledge of 
mortality and good and evil.

1277
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:57,260
Adam and Eve were cast out of paradise 
and history begins and that seems right 

1278
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:59,460
to me because I don't think that history
didn't begin before.

1279
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:03,090
Human beings became self conscious,
so there's something about that.

1280
01:20:03,091 --> 01:20:08,091
That's right,
because history doesn't really begin 

1281
01:20:08,091 --> 01:20:10,191
until people become aware of the future.
Pe history doesn't really begin until 

1282
01:20:10,191 --> 01:20:11,130
people work and start to build,
right?

1283
01:20:11,131 --> 01:20:16,131
We still live.
We would still be ensconced in 

1284
01:20:16,131 --> 01:20:19,101
essentially an animal existence until 
we're aware of the future and start to 

1285
01:20:19,101 --> 01:20:21,300
buttress herself against it.
Start to wear clothing,

1286
01:20:21,301 --> 01:20:26,301
start to build buildings,
start to make cities all in all in 

1287
01:20:26,301 --> 01:20:29,460
consequence of having become aware of 
the fact that we're fragile and that the

1288
01:20:29,461 --> 01:20:34,461
future is a dangerous place,
so that seems to me to be existentially 

1289
01:20:34,461 --> 01:20:38,001
correct and then we have the story of 
Cain and Abel Brilliantly placed 

1290
01:20:38,001 --> 01:20:41,901
immediately afterwards,
and so those are the two first two 

1291
01:20:41,901 --> 01:20:43,920
people in history essentially,
and they make sacrifices,

1292
01:20:43,921 --> 01:20:46,410
so that goes along with the idea of the 
discovery work,

1293
01:20:46,411 --> 01:20:48,600
the necessity of work and the discovery 
of the future,

1294
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:51,870
and then exactly what you'd expect would
happen.

1295
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:53,740
One

1296
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:59,480
segment of mankind,
let's say makes the sacrifices properly 

1297
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:03,321
and prevails in the other segment,
makes the sacrifice is improperly and 

1298
01:21:03,321 --> 01:21:07,491
fails,
and that's perfectly reasonable given 

1299
01:21:07,491 --> 01:21:08,550
what you see around you because that's 
what seems to happen all the time.

1300
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:13,910
And then more interestingly,
I would say the sacrificial failure 

1301
01:21:14,461 --> 01:21:19,461
produces embitterment right?
And that embitterment produces a hatred 

1302
01:21:21,941 --> 01:21:26,941
for being and the desire for revenge and
that seems perfectly appropriate.

1303
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:30,580
When I look at people who are bitter and
who want revenge,

1304
01:21:31,150 --> 01:21:34,030
it's generally because they're 
sacrificial efforts have failed.

1305
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:37,780
Now I'm loath to say that that's a 
matter of their own doing,

1306
01:21:37,781 --> 01:21:42,781
although sometimes it clearly is the 
embittered and vengeful complained to 

1307
01:21:47,311 --> 01:21:52,311
God.
Blame him for the structure of 

1308
01:21:52,311 --> 01:21:54,320
existence.
You know,

1309
01:21:54,321 --> 01:21:57,470
I read about the columbine massacre and 
the kids who

1310
01:21:58,550 --> 01:21:59,360
undertook it.

1311
01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:05,910
That'll make your hair stand on end.
If you want to read something that will 

1312
01:22:05,910 --> 01:22:07,990
really disturb you,
a reading Eric Harris,

1313
01:22:07,991 --> 01:22:12,991
his writings will really disturb you.
No matter how much you know about human 

1314
01:22:12,991 --> 01:22:15,060
beings reading Eric Harris's writings 
will disturb you,

1315
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:19,980
and Harris has cane you know,
he says it straightforwardly.

1316
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:23,580
Hates human beings,
hates being itself.

1317
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:26,640
He would destroy everything if it was 
within his power to do that,

1318
01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:32,390
and of course him and his colleague were
motivated to produce far more carnage 

1319
01:22:32,911 --> 01:22:37,911
than they manage that day.
What was successful was only a fraction 

1320
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:41,760
of what they had planned and and Harris 
said very straightforwardly that he was,

1321
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:46,910
that he had set himself up as the judge 
of being in that it lacked all utility 

1322
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:49,530
in his eyes.
Human beings certainly should all be,

1323
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:54,950
should all be removed from the face of 
existence because of their pathology.

1324
01:22:55,290 --> 01:22:59,070
And the fundamental horrors of being 
itself.

1325
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:02,610
So there's nothing in the Cain and Abel 
story that isn't real.

1326
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:07,670
It's real.
And cain complaints to God as people 

1327
01:23:07,670 --> 01:23:10,351
will when they're dreams are dashed.
And that goes for people who don't 

1328
01:23:10,351 --> 01:23:11,470
believe in God too.
It doesn't really matter.

1329
01:23:11,471 --> 01:23:13,450
You know?
It's harder,

1330
01:23:13,451 --> 01:23:15,940
I suppose if you're atheistic,
to figure out who to blame,

1331
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,860
but that doesn't mean that the 
sentiment,

1332
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:22,660
it doesn't mean that the sentiment is 
any different,

1333
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,540
right?
The same drama is being enacted.

1334
01:23:25,810 --> 01:23:29,590
You shake your fist at the structure of 
being rather than that God himself,

1335
01:23:29,591 --> 01:23:32,830
but it doesn't make any difference 
except in the details.

1336
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:41,880
So God responds to Kate and tells him 
that he's got no right to judge being 

1337
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,380
before he gets his sacrificial house in 
order.

1338
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:49,980
And even worse,
he says that Kane is the architect of 

1339
01:23:51,241 --> 01:23:56,241
his own downfall and the invited 
catastrophe in his own into his own 

1340
01:23:56,701 --> 01:24:01,701
house willingly and entered into a 
creative union with it and therefore 

1341
01:24:01,861 --> 01:24:06,861
brought about his own demise.
And it's that additional self knowledge 

1342
01:24:06,861 --> 01:24:07,080
and you can imagine to,
you know,

1343
01:24:07,081 --> 01:24:09,840
imagine that you're in,
you're facing your life,

1344
01:24:09,841 --> 01:24:14,841
you're facing the failures of your life,
and let's say that you've had a failed 

1345
01:24:14,841 --> 01:24:18,231
life and you're bitter about that,
and then you meditate upon it and you 

1346
01:24:18,231 --> 01:24:20,130
think,
why has this come about?

1347
01:24:20,131 --> 01:24:20,940
And then you think,

1348
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:24,260
well,
perhaps I did something wrong.

1349
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:29,890
You know,
when Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn wrote the 

1350
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:31,811
Gulag archipelago,
which is the book that detailed the 

1351
01:24:31,811 --> 01:24:34,160
catastrophes of the Soviet Union and 
help bring it down here,

1352
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:37,190
this one part of that book that just 
struck me so,

1353
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:39,530
so viciously when I read it,
he,

1354
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:43,070
he was in the car,
in the Gulag and he was there for a very

1355
01:24:43,071 --> 01:24:48,071
long time and he said that he observed a
variety of people in the camps who he 

1356
01:24:48,951 --> 01:24:50,720
really admired.
They were rare.

1357
01:24:50,810 --> 01:24:52,850
They were usually religious believers in
his,

1358
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:58,240
in his experience who were not 
participating in the pathology of the 

1359
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:00,290
camps at all.
Period.

1360
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:05,470
No matter what he said,
he learned a lot from watching those 

1361
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:08,501
people.
He had a hard time believing that they 

1362
01:25:08,501 --> 01:25:08,501
even existed,
that they could even exist.

1363
01:25:08,501 --> 01:25:12,340
But he said that one of the things that 
he was brought to as a consequence of 

1364
01:25:12,351 --> 01:25:17,210
watching those people live their 
contract with goodness out,

1365
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:19,400
even under the most horrifying of 
conditions,

1366
01:25:19,401 --> 01:25:24,401
was that it was possible that he himself
was responsible for his position in the 

1367
01:25:26,811 --> 01:25:31,811
camp.
Now it's a very dangerous line of 

1368
01:25:31,811 --> 01:25:34,631
argumentation because who wants to be 
the one who blames the victim for the 

1369
01:25:34,641 --> 01:25:35,780
catastrophe.
You know,

1370
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:38,600
you have to be very careful when you 
walk down that road.

1371
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:42,170
But Solzhenitsyn was speaking about 
himself and he said,

1372
01:25:42,171 --> 01:25:43,430
well,
he was a communist,

1373
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:48,520
you know,
and he arrogantly and forthrightly move 

1374
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:54,910
the movement out into the world and had 
not fully gone over his life with a fine

1375
01:25:56,421 --> 01:26:01,310
tooth comb to find out what mistakes he 
had made that brought him so low.

1376
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:04,160
But his contention eventually that part

1377
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:09,160
of the reason that he ended up where he 
ended up was because he and many others 

1378
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:14,500
had completely forfeited their 
relationship with the truth and it 

1379
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:17,201
allowed their society do degenerate into
deceit and tyrannical catastrophe 

1380
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:22,780
without mounting sufficient opposition.
And so he decided when he was in the 

1381
01:26:24,201 --> 01:26:28,460
camps to straightened himself out bit by
bit,

1382
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:33,730
and that culminated in the production of
the Gulag archipelago and that book 

1383
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:38,170
really demolished once and for all any 
moral credibility that the communist 

1384
01:26:38,661 --> 01:26:43,661
totalitarian systems had left.
And so one man in the depths of 

1385
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:47,030
catastrophe who determined through good 
example,

1386
01:26:47,031 --> 01:26:52,031
at least in part to stop lying,
produced a book eventually the 

1387
01:26:52,031 --> 01:26:56,120
demolished the foundation of the very 
system that had imprisoned him.

1388
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:58,550
And that is really worth thinking about 
now.

1389
01:26:58,570 --> 01:27:03,570
That's one example of the absolute 
grandeur of the human soul and the 

1390
01:27:04,311 --> 01:27:09,290
capacity for transformation that it has 
when let loose properly on the world.

1391
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:13,730
So let's say you're conceptualizing your
own failure,

1392
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:18,760
you know,
and you meditated on it and you come to 

1393
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:18,980
the conclusion that God forced came to,
Hey,

1394
01:27:18,981 --> 01:27:21,950
not only have things not been going very
well for you,

1395
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:25,340
but it's actually your fault.
And not only that,

1396
01:27:25,341 --> 01:27:27,860
you brought it on yourself and not only 
that,

1397
01:27:27,861 --> 01:27:31,580
you knew it all the time.
Well then you might think you'll wake up

1398
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:32,450
and fly,
right?

1399
01:27:32,451 --> 01:27:34,040
Right.
You'll get your wings in order and fly,

1400
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:39,041
right,
but there's no reason to assume that at 

1401
01:27:39,041 --> 01:27:40,040
all and that's not what happens to Cain.
That just makes him more bitter.

1402
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:42,140
Right.
And you can understand that if you think

1403
01:27:42,141 --> 01:27:47,141
about it just for a second,
it's like bad enough when something 

1404
01:27:47,141 --> 01:27:49,631
horrible happens to you,
but then to have to swallow the 

1405
01:27:49,631 --> 01:27:52,181
additional pill,
right path to take in the information 

1406
01:27:52,181 --> 01:27:52,700
that you could have done something 
different.

1407
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:57,170
It was avoidable and you knew it at the 
time and you decided to do it anyways.

1408
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,490
And I think people are in that situation
a lot more often than every.

1409
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:02,510
Anyone is willing to admit,
you know,

1410
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:07,400
you have that little voice in the back 
of your head that says don't do it.

1411
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:13,870
And you override it and you know,
it's arrogance that makes you override 

1412
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:14,000
it.
It's always arrogance.

1413
01:28:14,001 --> 01:28:15,290
You know,
it always warns you.

1414
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:16,520
It's always arrogance.
Yeah.

1415
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,170
I can get away with it.
It's like,

1416
01:28:18,350 --> 01:28:19,370
no,
you can't.

1417
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:21,800
I don't think you ever get away with 
anything.

1418
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:24,590
So in maybe your experience has taught 
you different,

1419
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:26,240
but my suspicions are,
it hasn't.

1420
01:28:26,241 --> 01:28:28,010
And if you think it has,
well,

1421
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:33,250
the other shoe hasn't yet dropped.
So cane doesn't take the opportunity to 

1422
01:28:34,731 --> 01:28:39,731
let God's wisdom reorient his character 
and that that could have been outcome.

1423
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:44,270
He could have gone down on his knees so 
to speak,

1424
01:28:44,271 --> 01:28:44,900
and said,
oh my,

1425
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:47,780
Oh my God,
I've been wrong all along.

1426
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:50,660
I'd been living in properly.
I'd been making the wrong sacrifices,

1427
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:55,010
able deserves everything he has.
I got exactly what was coming to me,

1428
01:28:55,270 --> 01:29:00,270
you know,
could I possibly now straighten myself 

1429
01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:00,270
out and,
and,

1430
01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:00,270
and,
and,

1431
01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:04,540
and,
and live repentance and improve my 

1432
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:04,540
position.
But that's not what he did at all.

1433
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:05,280
He said,
all right,

1434
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:08,010
fair enough.
I get it.

1435
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:13,810
It's like I'm going to go after the 
thing I most admire and I'm going to 

1436
01:29:13,810 --> 01:29:18,681
destroy it and I'm going to do that 
despite its cost to me and I'm going to 

1437
01:29:18,681 --> 01:29:21,000
do that just to spite the creator of 
being.

1438
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:25,770
That's exactly what Harris did at 
Columbine.

1439
01:29:25,771 --> 01:29:27,690
It's exactly what he says.
In fact,

1440
01:29:27,870 --> 01:29:32,870
in his uncanny writings,
it's why the mass murders always shoot 

1441
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:34,950
themselves afterwards.
Not before,

1442
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:40,250
because you might wonder if you're so 
upset with the structure of being why 

1443
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:41,010
you don't just commit suicide in your 
basement.

1444
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:46,010
Why do you have to go out and mass 
murder before you top it off with a gun 

1445
01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:47,220
to your forehead?
Well,

1446
01:29:47,221 --> 01:29:52,221
you don't make the point is effectively 
if you just commit suicide in your 

1447
01:29:52,221 --> 01:29:55,161
basement.
It's like live my life means nothing to 

1448
01:29:55,161 --> 01:29:59,031
me but neither does anyone else's and 
neither does the structure of being 

1449
01:29:59,031 --> 01:30:01,530
itself and I'll take all my revenge as 
much as I possibly can.

1450
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:04,200
And then just to show you how little I 
care,

1451
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:08,940
I'll cap myself off at the end and I 
would say also people say all the time,

1452
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:14,550
I don't understand how that could happen
is like I don't believe that.

1453
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:20,450
I think an hour of thought of real 
thought,

1454
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:25,850
real thought about your darkest feelings
about existence itself illuminates the 

1455
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:28,920
pathway to that sort of behavior quite 
clearly.

1456
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:32,220
And I think if you.
I mean I might be wrong.

1457
01:30:32,221 --> 01:30:37,221
I might be a darker person than most and
it's certainly okay.

1458
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:39,410
Okay.

1459
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:50,720
Well,
at least I think there are plenty of 

1460
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:50,790
people out there who are sufficiently 
dark to knew exactly what I mean,

1461
01:30:50,791 --> 01:30:51,900
what I'm saying,
these things,

1462
01:30:51,901 --> 01:30:54,720
and I would also say that if it doesn't 
leap,

1463
01:30:54,721 --> 01:30:57,840
do your understanding how that pathway 
might be illuminated.

1464
01:30:57,841 --> 01:31:02,841
Then you need to know a lot more about 
yourself than you actually know now 

1465
01:31:02,841 --> 01:31:05,250
because it's whatever you might say 
about someone like Eric Harris.

1466
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:10,251
He was a human being too.
You know there's this idea in the New 

1467
01:31:10,251 --> 01:31:12,810
Testament that Christ was he who took 
the sins of the world onto himself.

1468
01:31:12,811 --> 01:31:14,850
It's a very complicated idea,
but part of it,

1469
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:21,110
part of it,
part of it is associated with the idea 

1470
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:21,450
that he met the devil in the desert as 
well.

1471
01:31:22,350 --> 01:31:27,350
To take the sins of mankind onto 
yourself is to understand that within 

1472
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:30,981
you dwells exactly the same spirit that 
commit the atrocities at columbine or 

1473
01:31:30,981 --> 01:31:35,100
that ran the camps at Auschwitz and to 
actually understand that that's part and

1474
01:31:35,101 --> 01:31:38,250
parcel of your makeup and then to take 
responsibility for it.

1475
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:42,120
And I think that in the aftermath of the
terrible 20th century,

1476
01:31:42,121 --> 01:31:47,121
that's what we're left with.
We're left with the necessity to take 

1477
01:31:47,121 --> 01:31:50,241
responsibility for the most terrible 
aspects of ourselves and that way 

1478
01:31:50,241 --> 01:31:52,650
perhaps we can stop those terrible 
things from happening again.

1479
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:53,580
That's all.

1480
01:31:54,390 --> 01:31:58,960
Thank

1481
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:06,580
it.
Also means you know that you don't look 

1482
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:06,580
for the.
You don't look for the,

1483
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:11,270
what would you call it,
the purveyor of malevolence outside 

1484
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:11,270
yourself,
right?

1485
01:32:11,370 --> 01:32:14,430
It isn't someone else,
even though sometimes it's someone else,

1486
01:32:14,431 --> 01:32:15,480
you know,
you know what I mean?

1487
01:32:15,481 --> 01:32:17,940
It's like there are identifiable 
perpetrators,

1488
01:32:17,941 --> 01:32:21,780
but that's not precisely the point.
The point is something more like that.

1489
01:32:21,781 --> 01:32:24,900
The proper place for the encapsulation 
of that malevolence,

1490
01:32:24,901 --> 01:32:29,901
at least the proper place to start is 
within the confines of your own 

1491
01:32:29,901 --> 01:32:34,101
existence and then perhaps within the 
confines of your family and that way 

1492
01:32:34,101 --> 01:32:38,991
you're not a danger to those that you 
misapprehend as malevolent and evil 

1493
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:41,460
because you won't get your aim right to 
begin with.

1494
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:46,940
You'll identify them improperly and 
you'll take your revenge in a manner 

1495
01:32:47,221 --> 01:32:51,390
that allows you to admit your own 
responsibility,

1496
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:57,080
to act out your unconscious desire for 
revenge and to move the world just that 

1497
01:32:57,331 --> 01:32:58,520
much closer to hail.

1498
01:33:03,970 --> 01:33:08,970
Well,
so cain killed Abel and then cain gives 

1499
01:33:08,970 --> 01:33:12,391
rise to his descendants,
one of whom is the person who's the 

1500
01:33:12,391 --> 01:33:13,600
first artificer in weapons of war and 
then comes the flood.

1501
01:33:13,870 --> 01:33:18,870
Right?
Which seems perfectly miraculously 

1502
01:33:18,870 --> 01:33:20,140
reasonable to me because what those 
stories do,

1503
01:33:20,141 --> 01:33:25,141
it's so amazing that the story of Cain 
and Abel segues into the story of the 

1504
01:33:25,141 --> 01:33:29,671
flood because it is the case that the 
catastrophes that be set society can 

1505
01:33:30,761 --> 01:33:35,761
best be conceptualized as the spread of 
individual pathology into the social 

1506
01:33:35,761 --> 01:33:38,580
world and the and the.
What would you call the,

1507
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:44,080
the magnification of that pathology to 
the point where everything comes apart 

1508
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:48,720
and I truly believe that if you 
familiarize yourself with the last 

1509
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:52,380
hundred years of history,
that that's the conclusion that you 

1510
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:54,091
would derive and the people who are most
wise that I've read who commented on 

1511
01:33:54,091 --> 01:33:57,730
that say the same thing over and over,
which is the.

1512
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:03,960
The key to the prevention of the horrors
of Auschwitz and the Gulag in the future

1513
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:12,750
is the reconstruction of the individual 
soul at the level of each individual.

1514
01:34:14,830 --> 01:34:19,090
And that's a terrible message because it
puts the burden on you.

1515
01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:24,930
But it's an amazing message because it 
also means that you could be the source 

1516
01:34:24,930 --> 01:34:29,670
of the process that stops that 
catastrophe and malevolence from ever 

1517
01:34:30,350 --> 01:34:32,800
emerging again.
And you know,

1518
01:34:32,801 --> 01:34:37,801
it's hard for me to imagine that you 
have anything that could possibly be 

1519
01:34:37,801 --> 01:34:40,450
better to do with the time that you have
left.

1520
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:47,130
Well then we see noah who walks with God
and whose generations are in order,

1521
01:34:47,190 --> 01:34:52,190
right?
Which means that he's entered this 

1522
01:34:52,190 --> 01:34:52,260
contract with the good,
let's say,

1523
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:56,070
that has the protective function of the 
arc.

1524
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:59,930
He's put his together and he can ride 
out the worst catastrophe.

1525
01:34:59,931 --> 01:35:01,610
And he's actually our ancestor.
Right?

1526
01:35:01,611 --> 01:35:04,940
So interesting.
It's that these people who get their act

1527
01:35:04,941 --> 01:35:09,941
together properly and make a contract 
with the good are constantly presented 

1528
01:35:10,011 --> 01:35:15,011
as the genuine ancestors of mankind.
And that's a really positive element of 

1529
01:35:15,011 --> 01:35:16,910
the story as well.
And it's one I believe because,

1530
01:35:17,390 --> 01:35:19,460
well,
it hasn't been easy for us to get here.

1531
01:35:19,461 --> 01:35:24,461
You know,
we are the descendants of the great 

1532
01:35:24,461 --> 01:35:24,500
heroes of the past.
And if you took all those heroes and you

1533
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:29,800
and you and you,
and you told their stories and you 

1534
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:30,800
distilled their stories into a single 
story,

1535
01:35:30,801 --> 01:35:32,790
maybe you'd have a story like the story 
of knower,

1536
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:33,980
the story of Abraham.

1537
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:38,600
You know the story of the successful,
the story of our forefathers.

1538
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:43,920
You know not the cancer on the planet 
that certain people tend to think that 

1539
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:47,711
we are.
And so the goal is to be one of the 

1540
01:35:47,711 --> 01:35:51,461
people like that and there isn't 
anything better than can possibly be 

1541
01:35:51,461 --> 01:35:54,791
done.
In the alternative is something like 

1542
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:55,550
hell and so nola rides out the storm and
that's what everyone wants.

1543
01:35:55,551 --> 01:36:00,551
Because you want to ride out the storm.
You don't want to be happy because 

1544
01:36:00,551 --> 01:36:01,520
that'll just happen if it does or if it 
doesn't,

1545
01:36:01,730 --> 01:36:06,730
but you definitely want to constitute 
yourself so that you can ride out the 

1546
01:36:06,730 --> 01:36:07,190
storm because the storm is always 
coming.

1547
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:09,710
And so then you're fortified against the
worst.

1548
01:36:09,711 --> 01:36:14,711
And that's what you want.
Because we'll have the best you can 

1549
01:36:14,711 --> 01:36:18,221
handle,
the worst you have to prepare yourself 

1550
01:36:18,221 --> 01:36:21,731
for.
And then we see the same thing repeated 

1551
01:36:21,731 --> 01:36:21,731
in the story of Abraham essentially,
right?

1552
01:36:21,731 --> 01:36:25,130
Abraham makes this contract with the 
good and constantly renews it.

1553
01:36:25,131 --> 01:36:30,131
That's his sacrifice and his worship.
He constantly renews it and he has the 

1554
01:36:30,131 --> 01:36:34,170
adventures that are sufficiently typical
of the adventures of a human being who's

1555
01:36:34,190 --> 01:36:36,830
alive and engaging in the world,
right?

1556
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:37,370
He,
he,

1557
01:36:37,670 --> 01:36:40,910
he bumps himself up against all the 
horrors of existence,

1558
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:46,270
and yet the story is told in such a 
manner that reveals that his primary 

1559
01:36:47,421 --> 01:36:52,421
ethical commitment to the overarching 
good is sufficient to protect him 

1560
01:36:53,301 --> 01:36:56,840
against the vicissitudes of existence.
Well,

1561
01:36:56,870 --> 01:37:00,410
that's an optimistic story.
And as a pessimistic person,

1562
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:05,920
I appreciate an optimistic story that's 
believable and there's great demands 

1563
01:37:06,741 --> 01:37:09,950
placed on Abraham.
It's not as if this just comes to him as

1564
01:37:09,951 --> 01:37:14,951
a gift.
He has to be willing to sacrifice 

1565
01:37:14,951 --> 01:37:15,080
whatever is necessary in order to 
maintain that contract.

1566
01:37:15,081 --> 01:37:20,081
And so that seems to me to be realistic.
There's no reason to assume that life 

1567
01:37:20,081 --> 01:37:22,400
isn't so difficult that it actually 
demands the best from you,

1568
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,980
that it's actually structured in that 
manner,

1569
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:30,400
and that if you were willing to reveal 
the best in you in response to the 

1570
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:35,261
vicissitudes of life,
that you might actually prevail and you 

1571
01:37:35,261 --> 01:37:37,310
might actually set things straight 
around you and

1572
01:37:39,670 --> 01:37:41,080
well,
what if that was true?

1573
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:48,140
That would be a remarkable thing and I,
I can't see how it cannot be true,

1574
01:37:48,830 --> 01:37:51,470
and I,
I can't see that it's not stamped on the

1575
01:37:51,471 --> 01:37:55,710
soul of everyone who's conscious.
I think we all know this perfectly well,

1576
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:59,130
although the stories remind us,
you know,

1577
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:01,560
Plato,
socrates believed.

1578
01:38:01,561 --> 01:38:06,561
Then all knowledge was remembering.
You know,

1579
01:38:07,331 --> 01:38:12,331
he believed that the soul before birth 
had all knowledge and lost it at birth 

1580
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:17,410
and then experience reminded the soul of
what it already knew.

1581
01:38:17,950 --> 01:38:22,950
And there's something about that that's 
really true because you're not just 

1582
01:38:23,810 --> 01:38:28,130
creature that emerged 30 years ago or 40
years ago.

1583
01:38:28,131 --> 01:38:31,040
You're,
you're the inheritor of three and a half

1584
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:34,250
billion years worth of biological 
engineering,

1585
01:38:34,251 --> 01:38:37,850
right?
You have your nature stamp deeply inside

1586
01:38:37,851 --> 01:38:42,851
of you,
far more deeply than we had any of us 

1587
01:38:42,851 --> 01:38:45,341
realize,
and when you come across these great 

1588
01:38:45,341 --> 01:38:45,341
stories,
these reminders,

1589
01:38:45,341 --> 01:38:49,151
there are a reminder of how to be 
properly and they echo in your soul 

1590
01:38:49,151 --> 01:38:53,441
because the structure's already there.
The external stories are manifestations 

1591
01:38:56,101 --> 01:39:01,101
of the internal reality and then there 
are call to that until her internal 

1592
01:39:01,101 --> 01:39:04,521
reality to reveal itself.
Well.

1593
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:09,470
Then we come to the end of the abrahamic
stories,

1594
01:39:09,471 --> 01:39:14,330
least this section of them with Sarah's 
death and Abraham is called upon to make

1595
01:39:14,331 --> 01:39:17,420
the supreme sacrifice and interestingly 
enough,

1596
01:39:17,421 --> 01:39:19,760
because he's willing to make the supreme
sacrifice,

1597
01:39:20,030 --> 01:39:25,030
he actually doesn't have to.
And that's an interesting thing as well 

1598
01:39:25,030 --> 01:39:29,590
because I believe that it's reasonable 
from a psychological perspective to 

1599
01:39:29,590 --> 01:39:33,140
point out that the more willing you are,
for example,

1600
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:39,920
to face eth,
perhaps the less likely it is that 

1601
01:39:40,321 --> 01:39:44,160
you're going to have to face it at least
in an ignoble manner.

1602
01:39:47,310 --> 01:39:52,310
And so with that,
then we'll bring this 12 part series to 

1603
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:52,310
a close.

1604
01:39:59,530 --> 01:39:59,650
You

1605
01:39:59,650 --> 01:40:01,810
know,
I think that applause is for everyone,

1606
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:04,840
and I hate to say that because it sounds
so new age,

1607
01:40:07,690 --> 01:40:08,360
but you know,
it,

1608
01:40:08,380 --> 01:40:12,310
it really does.
It really does seem to me that this is a

1609
01:40:12,311 --> 01:40:14,080
participatory exercise,
you know,

1610
01:40:14,081 --> 01:40:19,081
and that and that it would not be 
possible for me to go through these 

1611
01:40:19,081 --> 01:40:19,750
stories without having you here to 
listen.

1612
01:40:19,810 --> 01:40:23,490
And so and I always think when talking 
to a crowd that it's a dialogue.

1613
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:28,810
It's a dialogue.
You sit and you listen and you've all 

1614
01:40:28,810 --> 01:40:28,810
listened and,
and,

1615
01:40:28,810 --> 01:40:30,100
and,
and thank God for that,

1616
01:40:30,101 --> 01:40:35,101
you know?
And that gives me a chance to think and 

1617
01:40:35,101 --> 01:40:37,351
it gives me a chance to watch and it 
gives me a chance to interact because 

1618
01:40:37,351 --> 01:40:37,351
you know,
you're emblematic of,

1619
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:42,360
of humanity at large.
I suppose that's one way of thinking 

1620
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:44,800
about it and for me to be able to craft 
what I'm saying so that it has an impact

1621
01:40:44,801 --> 01:40:49,060
on all of you here also means that I can
simultaneously crafted so that it hasn't

1622
01:40:49,061 --> 01:40:52,150
impacted in principle can reach far 
beyond this place.

1623
01:40:52,150 --> 01:40:53,560
And so,
you know,

1624
01:40:53,650 --> 01:40:58,650
I'm hoping that I'm really hoping that 
one of the things that can start to 

1625
01:40:58,650 --> 01:41:01,060
happen with this at least is that we can
put our culture back on.

1626
01:41:01,061 --> 01:41:06,061
It's from foundation because it's 
something that's desperately needed and 

1627
01:41:06,061 --> 01:41:09,750
in order to do that we have to 
understand both the evil and the 

1628
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:11,320
nobility of the human soul.
And that's like,

1629
01:41:11,321 --> 01:41:13,210
that's,
that's a fundamental truth,

1630
01:41:13,211 --> 01:41:18,211
you know,
and I don't think you can get to the 

1631
01:41:18,211 --> 01:41:18,211
nobility without a soldier and through 
the eval.

1632
01:41:18,211 --> 01:41:21,070
I really don't believe that at all.
It's no place for the naive to go,

1633
01:41:21,071 --> 01:41:23,800
that's for sure.
But anyways,

1634
01:41:23,801 --> 01:41:28,801
I would like to thank you as you thank 
me for your close and careful attention 

1635
01:41:28,871 --> 01:41:33,871
and your support during all of this.
It's been a really a remarkable 

1636
01:41:33,871 --> 01:41:37,411
experience.
It's certainly sort of developed beyond 

1637
01:41:37,411 --> 01:41:40,060
my,
my dreams.

1638
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:40,540
So

1639
01:41:40,910 --> 01:41:45,910
thank you.
Thank you.

1640
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:56,640
Onto the questions.

1641
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:08,220
Hi Dr Peterson.
It appears to me from this series a and 

1642
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:12,290
from the biblical stories themselves,
that the emphasis of the stories is the 

1643
01:42:12,290 --> 01:42:15,571
utmost importance of the fool for the 
maintenance and adaptation of being or 

1644
01:42:15,571 --> 01:42:17,170
society.
The figure who will lunge headfirst into

1645
01:42:17,171 --> 01:42:22,171
uncharted territory,
explicitly aware of the danger and risk 

1646
01:42:22,171 --> 01:42:22,480
of loss and confronting what cannot be 
understood,

1647
01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:27,660
but unafraid and with zeal and that the 
dangers of ideological possession just 

1648
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:32,131
as much or just as much of a concern as 
the individuals are unwilling and 

1649
01:42:32,171 --> 01:42:37,171
perhaps unable to form an opinion and 
take a stance one way or another when 

1650
01:42:37,171 --> 01:42:38,890
confronted with a fork in the road or a 
decision that must be made.

1651
01:42:39,490 --> 01:42:44,490
You've seen this apathy,
apathy throughout the universities as I 

1652
01:42:44,490 --> 01:42:45,970
have to in the public schooling system.
My question is,

1653
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:51,240
how can one model being the fool to 
plunge into the unknown and publicly 

1654
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:55,441
fall on your face in pursuit of learning
in a way that clearly demonstrates the 

1655
01:42:55,441 --> 01:42:55,630
urgency and utility of the fool?

1656
01:43:00,530 --> 01:43:05,530
Well,
there isn't any difference between the 

1657
01:43:05,530 --> 01:43:05,530
fool when someone who's courageous,
right?

1658
01:43:05,530 --> 01:43:08,981
From an architectural perspective,
and I mean Abraham is a fool obviously 

1659
01:43:08,981 --> 01:43:08,981
when he starts his,
his,

1660
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:14,020
his adventures.
I mean the story lays it out in that 

1661
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:14,690
matter.
He's far too old to be leaving home,

1662
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:16,930
for example.
He's a late bloomer,

1663
01:43:17,390 --> 01:43:18,020
you know,
and,

1664
01:43:18,100 --> 01:43:23,100
and then he has,
he has a lot of catastrophic adventures 

1665
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:26,111
along the way and certainly you could 
imagine that had you encountered him 

1666
01:43:26,111 --> 01:43:28,460
when he first encountered the famine in 
the land of strangers when he first went

1667
01:43:28,461 --> 01:43:30,830
out.
That's the idea that he had a,

1668
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:35,630
he had followed his misguided intuitions
would have been self evident,

1669
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:42,260
but in the abrahamic stories,
there is this call to get out and do 

1670
01:43:42,570 --> 01:43:43,650
and,
and that's it.

1671
01:43:43,651 --> 01:43:44,610
And the thing is,
is that,

1672
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:49,760
you know,
one of the things I've learned to put 

1673
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:49,760
it,
to make it concretely is that like,

1674
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:53,391
I've done a lot of different things in 
my life and every time I did a new 

1675
01:43:53,391 --> 01:43:53,391
thing,
I was a fool.

1676
01:43:53,391 --> 01:43:54,350
I did it badly.
I was an imposter.

1677
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:55,190
Right?
And,

1678
01:43:55,330 --> 01:44:00,330
and,
and because when you first start to do 

1679
01:44:00,330 --> 01:44:00,330
something,
you don't know what you're doing,

1680
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:05,860
but that's okay.
That's an acceptance of your 

1681
01:44:05,860 --> 01:44:05,860
vulnerability,
right?

1682
01:44:05,860 --> 01:44:06,800
And your ignorance.
That's humility in some sense.

1683
01:44:06,801 --> 01:44:08,540
The willingness to be a fool in the 
nude,

1684
01:44:08,541 --> 01:44:10,550
in the land of strangers.
That's it.

1685
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:15,760
The willingness to be a fool in the land
of strangers and that's an act of 

1686
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:19,631
courage because he will also reveal your
vulnerability to the world by stumbling 

1687
01:44:19,631 --> 01:44:20,990
around,
but as long as you're stumbling forward,

1688
01:44:20,991 --> 01:44:22,370
then you're going to move forward.

1689
01:44:23,270 --> 01:44:24,110
Now,
how do you do that?

1690
01:44:24,111 --> 01:44:25,230
More concretely?
Yeah,

1691
01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:26,900
aim at an ideal,
right,

1692
01:44:26,901 --> 01:44:29,330
and you aim in an ideal that's beyond 
you.

1693
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:34,900
Now maybe you don't aim to begin with,
had an idea that ideal that so beyond 

1694
01:44:34,900 --> 01:44:37,250
you,
that you're crushed by it magnificence.

1695
01:44:37,251 --> 01:44:38,900
You know?
Maybe that's,

1696
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:42,350
that's,
that's too demotivating to move you,

1697
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:46,130
but you could at least conceptualize 
yourself as the you.

1698
01:44:46,131 --> 01:44:51,131
That you are with fewer of the faults 
that you know of and that's a good 

1699
01:44:51,131 --> 01:44:56,081
start.
And I also think that's associated with 

1700
01:44:56,081 --> 01:44:56,081
the idea of humility.
Take stock,

1701
01:44:56,450 --> 01:45:00,080
figure out how it is that you're not who
you could be,

1702
01:45:00,890 --> 01:45:05,420
and then move in that direction and 
accept the consequences.

1703
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:08,990
You know you're,
you're going to get slapped a lot,

1704
01:45:09,290 --> 01:45:11,990
but maybe with each slap you'll 
straighten up a little bit.

1705
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:17,380
Especially if you listen even to the 
people who are slapping you because 

1706
01:45:17,380 --> 01:45:21,131
sometimes they're the ones who can 
reveal for you very quickly where it is 

1707
01:45:21,131 --> 01:45:25,961
that you're weak and insufficient so 
that you won't have to be that way in 

1708
01:45:25,961 --> 01:45:27,520
the future.
So yeah.

1709
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:37,190
Hello?
Hello.

1710
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:41,030
I'm Dr Peterson.
I have no questions for you.

1711
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:46,240
All I ever wanted to do is just stand in
front of you and be able to thank you 

1712
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:47,610
for everything you have done.

1713
01:45:49,950 --> 01:45:50,640
My pleasure.

1714
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:55,870
Thank you.

1715
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:04,590
Oh,
good morning citizen pietism.

1716
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:07,510
You got a short one?
Yeah,

1717
01:46:07,511 --> 01:46:08,780
I do.
I mean a question.

1718
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:12,370
The best question for last for us for 
this one's good,

1719
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:17,440
but first I'll break the ice.
People have said so stayed.

1720
01:46:17,441 --> 01:46:18,570
No,
no icebreaker.

1721
01:46:18,770 --> 01:46:20,440
Do you want me to get right into the 
real question?

1722
01:46:20,441 --> 01:46:22,100
I want you to get right into the 
questions.

1723
01:46:23,260 --> 01:46:27,060
So this question is about a hyper 
critical thinking.

1724
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:32,120
Yup.
Now everyone knows that critical 

1725
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:33,060
thinking is a great thing to develop.
You have to be able to cut,

1726
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:35,370
I guess,
think about your ideas.

1727
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:40,700
If information is presented to you have 
to decide if it's legitimate or if 

1728
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:44,571
there's some sort of deceit behind it,
but when it's taken to its extreme,

1729
01:46:45,330 --> 01:46:47,910
no matter how great or noble somebody 
is,

1730
01:46:47,911 --> 01:46:52,911
you can always find a in the armor and 
try to figure out how they're covering 

1731
01:46:52,911 --> 01:46:54,930
up something that's not great about 
them,

1732
01:46:54,931 --> 01:46:59,931
you know,
and you might then discredit everything 

1733
01:46:59,931 --> 01:46:59,931
they do is just a facade.

1734
01:46:59,931 --> 01:47:00,340
Okay.
So let.

1735
01:47:00,350 --> 01:47:05,350
So let me stop you there for a sec 
because I want to address two of the 

1736
01:47:05,350 --> 01:47:06,110
issues that you already brought up.
So there's,

1737
01:47:06,140 --> 01:47:10,310
there's the issue of hyper crit,
critical thinking partly in relationship

1738
01:47:10,311 --> 01:47:12,560
to yourself and partly in relationship 
to others.

1739
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:16,820
So I'd like to address the issue with 
regards to yourself to begin with.

1740
01:47:17,420 --> 01:47:19,700
So there's this idea that Carl Jung 
developed,

1741
01:47:20,270 --> 01:47:23,270
he extracted it.
I don't know from where,

1742
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:25,430
from some ancient writings that he was 
familiar with.

1743
01:47:25,431 --> 01:47:29,690
I believe they were Jewish writings.
He said that classically speaking,

1744
01:47:29,691 --> 01:47:34,691
traditionally speaking,
God was viewed to rule being with two 

1745
01:47:34,691 --> 01:47:36,050
hands,
right hand and left hand.

1746
01:47:36,051 --> 01:47:39,380
And the right hand was justice and that 
was,

1747
01:47:39,381 --> 01:47:41,120
you're going to get what's coming to 
you,

1748
01:47:41,690 --> 01:47:46,690
but the left hand was mercy and the idea
essentially was that the cosmos could 

1749
01:47:46,690 --> 01:47:49,490
not exist without the proper combination
of justice and mercy.

1750
01:47:49,820 --> 01:47:54,820
You should get what's coming to you,
but people are fallible and they make 

1751
01:47:54,820 --> 01:47:58,451
mistakes.
And so it's reasonable to apply that to 

1752
01:47:58,451 --> 01:47:58,451
yourself.
You know,

1753
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:03,760
there's an idea that's been developed by
psychologists over the last few decades 

1754
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:07,931
that people are basically narcissistic 
and that they generally feel that 

1755
01:48:07,931 --> 01:48:10,910
they're better at most things than other
people don't buy that.

1756
01:48:10,970 --> 01:48:13,610
I don't think the experimental evidence 
for that is very strong.

1757
01:48:13,611 --> 01:48:15,650
And I certainly haven't seen that.
For example,

1758
01:48:15,651 --> 01:48:20,651
in my clinical practice where I've seen 
that people are generally far harder on 

1759
01:48:20,651 --> 01:48:21,110
themselves than they are on other 
people.

1760
01:48:22,030 --> 01:48:23,870
Um,
one example of that,

1761
01:48:23,871 --> 01:48:25,580
I've written about this in my new book 
too,

1762
01:48:25,581 --> 01:48:26,120
is that,
you know,

1763
01:48:26,121 --> 01:48:31,121
if you have a pet that's sick and you 
take it to the vet and you get 

1764
01:48:31,121 --> 01:48:34,421
medication,
you're very likely to give the pet the 

1765
01:48:34,421 --> 01:48:36,050
entire course of medication to go to the
pharmacy to get the prescription filled,

1766
01:48:36,380 --> 01:48:39,140
to give the pet the medication to follow
it through.

1767
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:41,990
But if you are the person who has the 
problem,

1768
01:48:42,230 --> 01:48:47,230
yeah,
you all laugh because you know the 

1769
01:48:47,230 --> 01:48:47,230
story.
It's like a 30,

1770
01:48:47,230 --> 01:48:49,460
you won't even go fill the prescription 
and of the remaining two thirds of you,

1771
01:48:49,461 --> 01:48:52,010
half of won't,
won't take it to completion.

1772
01:48:52,011 --> 01:48:54,050
And you think,
well why are people like that?

1773
01:48:54,051 --> 01:48:57,170
And I think it's because they know 
themselves.

1774
01:48:57,350 --> 01:49:02,350
They have contempt for themselves 
because of their flaws and then they 

1775
01:49:02,350 --> 01:49:06,220
come to despise themselves.
And I think that's a big mistake that's 

1776
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:09,821
locked,
that's too much justice and not enough 

1777
01:49:09,821 --> 01:49:09,821
mercy.
And you know,

1778
01:49:09,821 --> 01:49:13,481
young wrote about the biblical 
injunction that you should treat your 

1779
01:49:13,481 --> 01:49:15,620
neighbor as if he were yourself 
essentially.

1780
01:49:16,460 --> 01:49:19,310
But he talked about that isn't equation,
which was quite interesting.

1781
01:49:19,311 --> 01:49:23,390
So because it's often read as something 
like you should be nice to people,

1782
01:49:23,391 --> 01:49:28,391
which is not what it means at all 
because first nice is a very low end 

1783
01:49:28,391 --> 01:49:29,960
virtue,
but it isn't what it means.

1784
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:34,960
What it means is that you should,
you should treat your neighbor as if he 

1785
01:49:35,031 --> 01:49:38,450
or she is someone that you wish to 
encourage and develop,

1786
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:42,380
but then you should also have exactly 
the same attitude towards yourself,

1787
01:49:42,381 --> 01:49:47,381
which is sort of in some sense,
regardless of what your opinion is of 

1788
01:49:47,381 --> 01:49:47,470
yourself.
Critical,

1789
01:49:47,471 --> 01:49:52,471
let's say hypercritical even,
which is often the case with people who 

1790
01:49:52,471 --> 01:49:54,130
are anxious or perhaps we were hyper 
conscientious.

1791
01:49:54,610 --> 01:49:59,610
You have to put forward to yourself the 
same sympathy we could say that you 

1792
01:50:00,971 --> 01:50:03,430
would extend to someone else that you 
cared for.

1793
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:08,760
That's the thing is that you have to 
come to treat yourself as if you're 

1794
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:11,090
someone that you care for.
And I mean that technically you know,

1795
01:50:11,170 --> 01:50:13,630
you detach yourself from yourself and 
you think,

1796
01:50:13,631 --> 01:50:18,631
okay,
well if I was going to construct a 

1797
01:50:18,631 --> 01:50:21,760
motive being that was optimal for this 
person that I happened to be,

1798
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:27,000
what would that look like?
And that sort of independent of whether 

1799
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,360
or not you think you deserve it,
it's like maybe you deserve it.

1800
01:50:28,370 --> 01:50:30,670
Maybe you don't innocent until proven 
guilty.

1801
01:50:30,671 --> 01:50:35,671
That's a pretty good policy.
But you should come to lay out a mode of

1802
01:50:35,741 --> 01:50:38,800
being for yourself that gives you some 
credit,

1803
01:50:39,220 --> 01:50:44,220
you know,
when that will also help you in your 

1804
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:44,350
dealings with other people.
But it's often very difficult for people

1805
01:50:44,351 --> 01:50:46,540
to do that to themselves.
Okay?

1806
01:50:46,541 --> 01:50:49,180
So that's the,
that's the first part of that.

1807
01:50:50,030 --> 01:50:55,030
Perfect.
So it starts out with this hyper 

1808
01:50:55,030 --> 01:50:57,010
critical thinking and you talk a lot 
about niches,

1809
01:50:57,020 --> 01:51:02,020
assertion about the death of God.
But I see it sort of more like a willful

1810
01:51:02,511 --> 01:51:04,340
destruction of the,
uh,

1811
01:51:04,341 --> 01:51:09,341
the heroic ideal.
And I guess several months ago I had 

1812
01:51:09,341 --> 01:51:13,541
occasion to look up a definition or 
explanation for the Zeitgeists of modern

1813
01:51:15,561 --> 01:51:20,120
victimhood or outrage culture.
And I sought in this particular case and

1814
01:51:20,121 --> 01:51:22,340
I found.
And this paragraph,

1815
01:51:22,341 --> 01:51:27,341
okay,
this has what you call the rhythmic 

1816
01:51:27,341 --> 01:51:28,640
cadence that just made my hair stand up 
on a sense.

1817
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:31,640
And if you could look at it and read 
this,

1818
01:51:31,641 --> 01:51:32,360
this is better than

1819
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:37,390
the last one.
The image of man that dominates in 

1820
01:51:39,631 --> 01:51:44,631
modern literature and visual art,
cinema and theater is primarily a group 

1821
01:51:44,631 --> 01:51:46,380
gloomy image.
The great and the noble are suspect from

1822
01:51:46,381 --> 01:51:49,290
the outset.
They must be torn from their pedestal so

1823
01:51:49,291 --> 01:51:54,291
that one can see through them.
Morality counts as hypocrisy and joy is 

1824
01:51:54,291 --> 01:51:58,461
self deception.
Anyone who simply puts trust in the 

1825
01:51:58,461 --> 01:52:00,360
beautiful and the good is either 
inexcusably and ingenuous or acting with

1826
01:52:00,361 --> 01:52:05,361
evil intent.
The truly moral attitude is suspicion 

1827
01:52:05,361 --> 01:52:09,051
and it's greatest.
Success is in exposing criticism of 

1828
01:52:09,051 --> 01:52:11,220
society is obligatory.
It is impossible to find words,

1829
01:52:11,221 --> 01:52:14,790
lord and brutal enough to describe the 
dangers that threaten us.

1830
01:52:15,180 --> 01:52:20,180
This delight in the negative is not.
However unlimited there exists at the 

1831
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:25,071
same time,
an obligation to be optimistic and the 

1832
01:52:25,071 --> 01:52:26,100
failure to observe this obligation does 
not go unpunished.

1833
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:31,640
For example,
anyone who expresses the view that not 

1834
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:33,891
everything in the intellectual 
development of the modern period has 

1835
01:52:33,891 --> 01:52:33,891
been correct.

1836
01:52:33,891 --> 01:52:37,730
That is necessary in some essential 
areas to reflect on this shared wisdom 

1837
01:52:37,730 --> 01:52:40,020
of the great cultures has chosen to make
the wrong kind of criticism.

1838
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:45,350
He finds himself suddenly construct 
confronted with a resolute apologia for 

1839
01:52:45,350 --> 01:52:49,641
the fundamental of the modern age.
No matter how much delight one may take 

1840
01:52:49,641 --> 01:52:53,891
indignation,
he is not permitted to call into 

1841
01:52:53,891 --> 01:52:56,201
question the view that the fundamental 
trajectory of historical development is 

1842
01:52:56,201 --> 01:52:57,830
progress and that the good lies in the 
future and nowhere else.

1843
01:52:59,630 --> 01:53:01,940
You know,
I thought a lot about nihilism,

1844
01:53:01,970 --> 01:53:06,970
let's say and and its justification.
And I think that a very powerful 

1845
01:53:08,751 --> 01:53:13,751
justification for nihilism can be found 
in the mere observation that life is 

1846
01:53:13,751 --> 01:53:18,050
rife with tragedy and malevolence of 
which there is no doubt,

1847
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:24,340
but then I,
I got suspicious of that rationale for 

1848
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:28,430
nihilism over the years because a 
counter position to it emerged.

1849
01:53:28,431 --> 01:53:29,870
And this is something Nietzsche of 
course,

1850
01:53:29,871 --> 01:53:32,810
concentrated on as well that had more to
do with resentment.

1851
01:53:33,070 --> 01:53:38,070
It's like you can imagine negation of 
the heroic ideal from despair,

1852
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:40,250
from the despair,
say,

1853
01:53:40,251 --> 01:53:43,040
produced by tragedy and by exposure to 
malevolence,

1854
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:48,340
but it's also,
it's completely an delightfully 

1855
01:53:48,340 --> 01:53:51,590
irresponsible to negate the heroic ideal
because it means that you don't have any

1856
01:53:51,591 --> 01:53:56,591
responsibility and it seems to me that 
if you're nihilistic and prone to 

1857
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:02,690
criticize the heroic foundation of let's
say Western culture,

1858
01:54:03,140 --> 01:54:08,140
that one of the first questions that you
could ask yourself is what makes you so 

1859
01:54:08,140 --> 01:54:10,430
sure that you're appropriately cynical,
suspicious,

1860
01:54:10,431 --> 01:54:15,431
and critical and not just running away 
as fast as you possibly can from every 

1861
01:54:15,431 --> 01:54:17,360
bit of responsibility that you could 
possibly adopt.

1862
01:54:18,140 --> 01:54:23,140
And I think that that's a perfectly 
reasonable perspective and I think that 

1863
01:54:23,140 --> 01:54:26,561
that is reflected to some degree in what
the person who wrote this paragraph was 

1864
01:54:26,561 --> 01:54:27,420
attempting to new guests who it was.
Wrote that.

1865
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:30,230
No,
I can't really know.

1866
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:36,100
I left you a hint on who has it.
Cardinal Ratzinger.

1867
01:54:36,130 --> 01:54:38,560
Come on.
All right.

1868
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:41,680
I'm going to take another question.
Well done.

1869
01:54:42,140 --> 01:54:43,740
Hm.

1870
01:54:47,230 --> 01:54:49,030
Hello.
Hello.

1871
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:50,890
How are you doing?
Doing good.

1872
01:54:50,891 --> 01:54:51,920
Dr Hughes.
And uh,

1873
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:54,010
it's been a pleasure.
Twelve weeks,

1874
01:54:54,250 --> 01:54:56,530
12,
12 moments.

1875
01:54:56,531 --> 01:54:57,880
Let's say,
okay,

1876
01:54:58,210 --> 01:55:03,210
so two weeks ago we talked about your 
mischievous suggestion,

1877
01:55:03,250 --> 01:55:08,250
I might say,
a to cut the university's funding by 25 

1878
01:55:08,250 --> 01:55:11,770
percent and how that might've influenced
that sort of language and,

1879
01:55:11,810 --> 01:55:14,560
uh,
Andrew Scheer's platform,

1880
01:55:14,561 --> 01:55:15,790
right?
And so,

1881
01:55:15,791 --> 01:55:20,140
and then you discussed how you're not 
exactly sure what your role is in all of

1882
01:55:20,141 --> 01:55:22,510
this and,
and that,

1883
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:28,090
uh,
you don't want to be in a war and you 

1884
01:55:28,090 --> 01:55:28,270
don't want to be using more like 
language and,

1885
01:55:29,410 --> 01:55:31,840
um,
and I think,

1886
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:33,260
I think what you,
what,

1887
01:55:33,270 --> 01:55:34,990
what,
what you want to be doing is,

1888
01:55:35,140 --> 01:55:37,680
is you're trying to restore order but

1889
01:55:37,790 --> 01:55:41,230
not,
not but not but not have conflict.

1890
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:43,070
And um,

1891
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,690
and so I,
so I,

1892
01:55:45,750 --> 01:55:48,750
so after the,
after the lecture two weeks ago,

1893
01:55:48,751 --> 01:55:51,090
I asked you like a,
maybe I,

1894
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:53,940
maybe I should do some sales work for 
your,

1895
01:55:53,970 --> 01:55:57,810
a postmodern lexicon website and,
uh,

1896
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:01,260
but I think I've found a better niche 
for,

1897
01:56:01,330 --> 01:56:06,330
uh,
someone of my temperament to help this 

1898
01:56:06,330 --> 01:56:06,330
cause.
So,

1899
01:56:06,330 --> 01:56:07,010
um,
I think I,

1900
01:56:07,050 --> 01:56:12,050
so I go to dalhousie university and 
because so many students are dropping 

1901
01:56:13,321 --> 01:56:15,330
out,
especially men and especially,

1902
01:56:15,670 --> 01:56:16,740
um,
at,

1903
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:18,300
uh,
ethnic minorities.

1904
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:23,720
Um,
they've created this team called the 

1905
01:56:23,720 --> 01:56:27,170
student success team or something or 
student success advisors and you've been

1906
01:56:27,590 --> 01:56:31,200
extremely,
a incredibly successful crowdfunding,

1907
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:34,460
um,
for your research and a,

1908
01:56:34,820 --> 01:56:36,360
uh,
on your patriot.

1909
01:56:36,361 --> 01:56:41,361
And I think like how much does it cost 
for a single person to do the self 

1910
01:56:41,370 --> 01:56:44,170
authoring program?
Well,

1911
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:46,890
it's a two for one,
so it's about $15.

1912
01:56:47,190 --> 01:56:48,090
Okay.
So,

1913
01:56:48,270 --> 01:56:50,340
okay.
So nothing then basically,

1914
01:56:51,330 --> 01:56:56,330
but I was thinking that we could somehow
we could incorporate the self authoring 

1915
01:56:56,461 --> 01:57:01,461
program into this,
into this new advisor committee at Dal's

1916
01:57:03,070 --> 01:57:05,370
that students can freak yourself out.

1917
01:57:05,370 --> 01:57:07,510
Man do it.
That's what,

1918
01:57:07,750 --> 01:57:12,750
that's like.
The data for the future authoring 

1919
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:15,411
program is quite clear if students even 
do it for an hour before they go to 

1920
01:57:15,411 --> 01:57:17,700
university,
they have a 30 or 30 percent less chance

1921
01:57:17,701 --> 01:57:20,950
of dropping out in the first semester.
So you know,

1922
01:57:20,951 --> 01:57:25,951
and,
and it would really be nice to see some 

1923
01:57:25,951 --> 01:57:27,831
student organizations that were 
seriously devoted to facilitating 

1924
01:57:27,831 --> 01:57:32,001
student success.
You might think that's what student 

1925
01:57:32,001 --> 01:57:32,001
organizations should do.
In fact,

1926
01:57:32,001 --> 01:57:36,920
well,
it seems rather self evident when you 

1927
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:36,920
think about it,
but you know,

1928
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:38,040
so I would say like if you're oriented 
in that direction,

1929
01:57:38,590 --> 01:57:43,590
get out or so it's a fine plan and it's,
I like the emphasis of it because you're

1930
01:57:44,371 --> 01:57:49,371
directing yourself towards the 
facilitation of individual 

1931
01:57:49,371 --> 01:57:52,941
accomplishment and you're at least going
to do very little harm that way and 

1932
01:57:52,941 --> 01:57:54,060
that's a really good start,
man.

1933
01:57:54,061 --> 01:57:59,061
You know that's because that's what you 
should think about when you're setting 

1934
01:57:59,061 --> 01:57:59,850
out to make things better.

1935
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,660
The first thing you should think is,
I'm not so sure I know what I'm doing,

1936
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:08,960
so why don't I first attempt to do the 
least amount of harm possible and by 

1937
01:58:09,301 --> 01:58:12,320
concentrating on helping someone develop
their own plan and,

1938
01:58:12,650 --> 01:58:17,650
and implement that into the future and 
encouraging them with regards to 

1939
01:58:17,650 --> 01:58:19,890
whatever success they would like to find
their way,

1940
01:58:20,190 --> 01:58:25,190
there's a pretty low probability that 
you're going to act the tearer tyrant 

1941
01:58:25,190 --> 01:58:25,190
and,
and,

1942
01:58:25,190 --> 01:58:28,560
and play a detrimental role.
So good luck.

1943
01:58:28,820 --> 01:58:30,410
Cool.
Maybe we can communicate about it.

1944
01:58:30,470 --> 01:58:31,280
Thank you.
Yes.

1945
01:58:31,281 --> 01:58:32,960
I'm going to send you an email.
Thank you very much.

1946
01:58:35,990 --> 01:58:37,220
Hi Dr Peterson

1947
01:58:38,550 --> 01:58:41,310
first of these lectures that I've been 
here to to,

1948
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:42,040
but I've listened to all of

1949
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:45,250
them on youtube so far.
I'm going to get you close enough.

1950
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:46,390
All right.
That's good.

1951
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:48,090
Yeah.
Um,

1952
01:58:48,700 --> 01:58:53,700
and I've been trying to think up a this 
question since basically the first 

1953
01:58:53,700 --> 01:58:58,351
lecture because I'm a seminary student 
at an evangelical seminary and uh,

1954
01:58:59,250 --> 01:59:02,190
a lot of what you've been saying has 
really been resonating in it and it's.

1955
01:59:02,200 --> 01:59:05,830
And it's really been fascinating to 
listen to a.

1956
01:59:06,250 --> 01:59:11,250
and you know,
there's been many people who have been 

1957
01:59:11,250 --> 01:59:12,841
asking you questions like,
what do you believe about the 

1958
01:59:12,841 --> 01:59:12,841
resurrection?
Do you believe in God?

1959
01:59:12,841 --> 01:59:13,690
Are you a Christian?
And all these sorts of things.

1960
01:59:13,691 --> 01:59:18,691
And you know,
I've been listening very closely to all 

1961
01:59:18,691 --> 01:59:20,581
your answers and have groups of friends 
on facebook who are volume following 

1962
01:59:20,581 --> 01:59:20,581
very closely saying,
oh,

1963
01:59:20,581 --> 01:59:23,020
here what Peterson said this time,
maybe he's one of us finally,

1964
01:59:23,021 --> 01:59:23,920
or something like that.

1965
01:59:25,960 --> 01:59:30,960
But at the same time,
other ways that you explained some of 

1966
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:33,730
the stories sound very close to a,
what we call theological liberalism.

1967
01:59:33,870 --> 01:59:35,110
You know,
in the 19th century,

1968
01:59:35,111 --> 01:59:40,111
the idea that using historical critical 
methods of a reading and interpreting 

1969
01:59:40,111 --> 01:59:44,101
the Bible and understanding Jesus more 
as a moral figure than as a literal 

1970
01:59:44,101 --> 01:59:46,840
historical figure who was a tournament 
provide satisfaction for man.

1971
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:52,200
So I tried to figure out what the 
question was because I could interpret 

1972
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:56,671
what some of your answers were.
So I'm gonna put it into more of a 

1973
01:59:56,671 --> 01:59:59,161
general way.
Where exactly do you see yourself 

1974
01:59:59,161 --> 02:00:02,950
differing from traditional Orthodox 
Evangelical Christianity and,

1975
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:05,530
and why would you defer their,
a,

1976
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:07,170
given how much you,
you,

1977
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:12,180
you seem to understand the importance of
the biblical stories in the Western 

1978
02:00:12,180 --> 02:00:12,180
history and western history.

1979
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:13,030
Okay.
Okay.

1980
02:00:13,060 --> 02:00:14,800
Well that's a good.
That's a good question.

1981
02:00:15,190 --> 02:00:20,190
Well,
I off obviously I have to answer in a 

1982
02:00:20,190 --> 02:00:20,730
general way.
I mean,

1983
02:00:20,770 --> 02:00:25,770
I think that one of the things that 
makes me different is that I take the 

1984
02:00:25,770 --> 02:00:26,980
idea that things are a 14 billion years 
old,

1985
02:00:26,981 --> 02:00:28,600
seriously,
you know,

1986
02:00:28,601 --> 02:00:31,450
and,
and the idea of evolution seriously.

1987
02:00:31,590 --> 02:00:32,110
I mean,
as,

1988
02:00:32,140 --> 02:00:35,350
as does the Catholic church by the way.
And so,

1989
02:00:35,410 --> 02:00:40,120
but I don't see that as an impediment to
the pursuit that I'm undertaking now.

1990
02:00:40,270 --> 02:00:42,690
I don't know how to bridge that gap 
precisely,

1991
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:45,250
but I'm not that worried about it.
I mean,

1992
02:00:45,490 --> 02:00:47,830
you can't bridge every gap.
It's just not possible.

1993
02:00:47,831 --> 02:00:50,320
It would require infinite knowledge.
Okay.

1994
02:00:50,321 --> 02:00:55,321
And how.
So that's one major because I'm coming 

1995
02:00:55,321 --> 02:00:57,991
at this from a scientific.
I really am coming at this from a 

1996
02:00:57,991 --> 02:00:57,991
scientific perspective,
you know,

1997
02:00:57,991 --> 02:01:02,221
like I try to make sure that everything 
that I talk about is commensurate with 

1998
02:01:02,221 --> 02:01:02,770
current scientific knowledge.

1999
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:08,220
Now current scientific knowledge,
no doubt is airing and all sorts of 

2000
02:01:08,220 --> 02:01:10,921
ways.
Like I think our notion about exactly 

2001
02:01:10,921 --> 02:01:10,930
how evolution progresses is flawed in 
many,

2002
02:01:10,931 --> 02:01:15,931
many ways.
And the recent discoveries in the field 

2003
02:01:15,931 --> 02:01:18,721
of epigenetics,
which show that you can actually 

2004
02:01:18,721 --> 02:01:18,721
transmit acquired characteristics,
you know,

2005
02:01:18,721 --> 02:01:23,251
has really put a whole real serious a 
stick in the spokes of the evolutionary 

2006
02:01:24,011 --> 02:01:25,150
bicycle,
let's say.

2007
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:29,410
But,
but then I also think the question is,

2008
02:01:29,411 --> 02:01:34,411
miss asked in some sense because I gave 
this lecture series a specific title for

2009
02:01:34,721 --> 02:01:39,721
a specific reason.
And the lecture series is the 

2010
02:01:39,721 --> 02:01:40,550
psychological significance of the 
biblical stories.

2011
02:01:40,850 --> 02:01:45,850
Now I'm not claiming that my 
psychological analysis exhausts the 

2012
02:01:45,850 --> 02:01:48,390
significance of the biblical stories.
You know,

2013
02:01:48,391 --> 02:01:50,750
they,
they have multitudes,

2014
02:01:50,780 --> 02:01:55,160
let's say layers of meaning and some of 
those layers of metaphysical and some of

2015
02:01:55,161 --> 02:02:00,161
them are more specifically religious.
And I'm trying the best I can not to 

2016
02:02:00,161 --> 02:02:02,900
wander into those domains like I do 
because it's impossible to keep yourself

2017
02:02:02,930 --> 02:02:03,410
grounded.

2018
02:02:03,770 --> 02:02:06,080
You know,
when you're a discursive speaker,

2019
02:02:06,081 --> 02:02:07,850
let's say,
or I'm trying to.

2020
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:13,180
What I'm trying to do is the sort of 
thing that young did essentially is to 

2021
02:02:13,180 --> 02:02:13,180
take a look at these old stories and 
say,

2022
02:02:13,180 --> 02:02:17,951
okay,
well let's look at this from the 

2023
02:02:17,951 --> 02:02:19,451
perspective of the human psyche and 
let's see what the significance can be.

2024
02:02:20,390 --> 02:02:23,750
And not to say that's all of the 
significance there is.

2025
02:02:23,810 --> 02:02:28,810
Who knows what significance there is.
One thing I have learned about the 

2026
02:02:28,810 --> 02:02:30,530
biblical stories is that no matter how 
deep you go into them,

2027
02:02:30,531 --> 02:02:33,680
you are not at the bottom.
And so that's been very,

2028
02:02:33,681 --> 02:02:38,681
very interesting to me,
and God only knows about the 

2029
02:02:38,681 --> 02:02:41,390
metaphysical substructure of reality 
because human beings certainly don't.

2030
02:02:41,810 --> 02:02:46,810
So I don't,
I don't want to claim that what I'm 

2031
02:02:46,810 --> 02:02:47,690
doing is a religious interpretation,
although you know,

2032
02:02:47,691 --> 02:02:52,691
it drifts into that direction.
I want to stay within the purview of my 

2033
02:02:52,691 --> 02:02:54,560
expertise such as it is,
and to say,

2034
02:02:54,561 --> 02:02:57,110
well,
if you look at this psychologically,

2035
02:02:57,200 --> 02:03:02,200
here's what you can extract as as 
pragmatically existentially and 

2036
02:03:02,391 --> 02:03:03,620
clinically meaningful.

2037
02:03:04,070 --> 02:03:09,070
And the rest of it,
well the rest of it has to be left in a 

2038
02:03:09,070 --> 02:03:12,281
bance.
And because I don't have the pasty to 

2039
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:18,400
investigate claims that go beyond that,
that does not mean that I'm saying that 

2040
02:03:18,590 --> 02:03:23,120
what I'm doing is reducing these stories
to their psychological significance.

2041
02:03:23,180 --> 02:03:26,510
Even though the psyche is a grand thing.
I'm not trying to do that.

2042
02:03:26,690 --> 02:03:31,690
It's not reductionistic.
It's a take on it so people can make up 

2043
02:03:31,941 --> 02:03:36,941
their own minds metaphysically and they 
also have to make up their own minds 

2044
02:03:36,941 --> 02:03:38,450
about how they're going to act.
Which is really the crucial issue as far

2045
02:03:38,451 --> 02:03:40,340
as I'm concerned.
So

2046
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:42,550
you bet.

2047
02:03:49,600 --> 02:03:51,940
Hi,
I had a question with respect to,

2048
02:03:51,941 --> 02:03:54,010
um,
data being presented I believe two weeks

2049
02:03:54,011 --> 02:03:54,940
ago.
Sorry,

2050
02:03:54,941 --> 02:03:57,100
a question with respect to data that you
presented,

2051
02:03:57,101 --> 02:04:02,101
I believe two lectures ago regarding the
use of Psilocybin in treatment of mental

2052
02:04:02,921 --> 02:04:03,940
illness.
Yes.

2053
02:04:03,941 --> 02:04:08,941
Yes.
So subsequently I looked up some of the 

2054
02:04:08,941 --> 02:04:11,640
recently published literature and one of
the studies that have found extremely 

2055
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:14,530
striking was one that was published less
than a year ago in the Lancet,

2056
02:04:14,531 --> 02:04:17,680
which is a very high impact,
well respected journal.

2057
02:04:18,340 --> 02:04:23,340
And what they looked at was a efficacy 
in patients with severe treatment 

2058
02:04:24,401 --> 02:04:28,390
resistant depression.
And what they found is that in 11 out of

2059
02:04:28,391 --> 02:04:30,100
12 of the patients,
um,

2060
02:04:30,460 --> 02:04:35,460
they showed significant remittance 
following just a single dose of the 

2061
02:04:35,561 --> 02:04:40,561
substance ops three months following the
single dose without additional 

2062
02:04:40,561 --> 02:04:41,630
devastating.
Um,

2063
02:04:41,670 --> 02:04:45,630
so this not only substantiates,
I suppose my own experiences,

2064
02:04:45,660 --> 02:04:50,660
but when you read some of the commentary
or review articles surrounding these 

2065
02:04:51,841 --> 02:04:54,900
types of topics now with respect to 
depression,

2066
02:04:54,901 --> 02:04:58,230
but things like posttraumatic stress 
disorder,

2067
02:04:58,310 --> 02:04:59,640
um,
addiction,

2068
02:05:00,150 --> 02:05:05,150
they'll unequivocally state that these 
types of results are completely 

2069
02:05:05,150 --> 02:05:08,610
unprecedented in the realm of 
psychiatric medicine.

2070
02:05:09,150 --> 02:05:11,460
So I was wondering if you could comment 
as to whether or not,

2071
02:05:11,480 --> 02:05:12,450
uh,
that type of,

2072
02:05:12,830 --> 02:05:15,960
I guess rhetoric is overblown and if 
not,

2073
02:05:16,040 --> 02:05:21,040
um,
do you see these being more mainstream 

2074
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:23,331
than your future or suspect that they'll
fall victim to something on wines of 

2075
02:05:23,331 --> 02:05:24,120
regulatory capture?

2076
02:05:24,230 --> 02:05:24,860
No,
I don't.

2077
02:05:25,160 --> 02:05:27,990
Well,
I don't think they're overstatements and

2078
02:05:27,991 --> 02:05:30,790
I think I know some of the people who 
are engaged in this research and they're

2079
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:33,770
actually very conservative people.
Like they're brave people,

2080
02:05:34,220 --> 02:05:36,080
but I mean conservative in the best 
sense,

2081
02:05:36,081 --> 02:05:36,740
you know,
they're not,

2082
02:05:36,770 --> 02:05:40,130
they're not timothy leary and I'm not 
trying to put down Timothy leary.

2083
02:05:40,131 --> 02:05:42,290
I'm really not.
But you know,

2084
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:45,150
some caution would have been a good 
thing.

2085
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:47,240
Although,
you know,

2086
02:05:48,020 --> 02:05:51,650
when something like when the 
psychedelics burst onto the scene,

2087
02:05:51,651 --> 02:05:53,330
no one had any idea what to do with 
them.

2088
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:53,960
Right.
So,

2089
02:05:53,990 --> 02:05:55,400
and,
and we still really don't,

2090
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:57,560
but the new research is being conducted 
very,

2091
02:05:57,561 --> 02:06:02,561
very carefully,
but it is really remarkable that those 

2092
02:06:02,561 --> 02:06:02,561
epithets are used.
Are those,

2093
02:06:02,561 --> 02:06:06,170
those terms are used to describe the 
results because those are the Lancet for

2094
02:06:06,171 --> 02:06:08,030
example,
is one of the top end medical journals.

2095
02:06:08,440 --> 02:06:11,870
If you don't see grand claims in the 
Lancet,

2096
02:06:11,871 --> 02:06:12,170
right?

2097
02:06:12,260 --> 02:06:13,960
Scientists don't write that way.
They're,

2098
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:18,110
they're trained from the very beginning 
to downplay their results,

2099
02:06:18,440 --> 02:06:23,440
but they're quite struck by the fact 
that these effects occur with single 

2100
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:23,660
doses.
Now I,

2101
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:27,350
I think that what we don't know about 
psychedelics could fill many,

2102
02:06:27,351 --> 02:06:30,120
many,
many thick volumes and they're in.

2103
02:06:30,260 --> 02:06:33,130
They're absolutely mysterious in their 
function,

2104
02:06:33,380 --> 02:06:35,150
purpose,
effect,

2105
02:06:35,330 --> 02:06:36,950
consequence,
all of that.

2106
02:06:37,220 --> 02:06:42,220
And I've always thought that it was 
really appalling that we stopped 

2107
02:06:42,220 --> 02:06:42,620
investigating them back in the 19 
sixties.

2108
02:06:42,621 --> 02:06:44,090
Although it's not been that long,
you know,

2109
02:06:44,660 --> 02:06:48,410
20 years historically speaking,
it's really nothing but,

2110
02:06:48,411 --> 02:06:50,420
um,
and no,

2111
02:06:50,421 --> 02:06:55,421
I don't think that there'll be that the 
research will be stopped by regulatory 

2112
02:06:55,421 --> 02:06:58,640
capture because the people who are doing
it now I think learned their lesson from

2113
02:06:58,641 --> 02:07:02,240
what happened in the sixties and are 
doing it pretty damn carefully.

2114
02:07:02,660 --> 02:07:07,660
So we can hope that more results like 
this are produced and that their rec 

2115
02:07:07,660 --> 02:07:12,130
replicable and that perhaps build,
prove helpful with any luck.

2116
02:07:13,310 --> 02:07:18,310
Yep.
Hi Dr Peterson.

2117
02:07:21,601 --> 02:07:26,601
I've found this lecture series really,
really enthralling and no one explained 

2118
02:07:29,830 --> 02:07:32,160
that one time for the question.
That's okay,

2119
02:07:32,170 --> 02:07:32,840
I'll,
I'll get late.

2120
02:07:32,850 --> 02:07:35,670
You get to the question,
but I'm curious like what,

2121
02:07:36,480 --> 02:07:41,480
why do you think that is?
Because it's a strange thing to have 

2122
02:07:41,480 --> 02:07:44,521
happened,
like where it's a lecturer on the Bible 

2123
02:07:44,521 --> 02:07:44,521
for God Sake,
you know,

2124
02:07:44,521 --> 02:07:47,050
it's like,
it's not something you'd go to a venture

2125
02:07:47,051 --> 02:07:50,230
capitalist with a business plan for.
So like what,

2126
02:07:50,231 --> 02:07:55,231
what,
what is it about it you think that's 

2127
02:07:55,231 --> 02:07:57,090
been that it's had that effect on you?
Pop asked you a question.

2128
02:07:57,571 --> 02:07:57,660
Yes.

2129
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:01,610
Look,

2130
02:08:02,580 --> 02:08:04,290
I don't want to.
I don't want to put you on the spot.

2131
02:08:04,291 --> 02:08:05,760
If you want to just move to your 
question,

2132
02:08:05,761 --> 02:08:07,500
that's fine,
but if you have an answer to that,

2133
02:08:07,501 --> 02:08:09,570
I would be very interested in knowing 
what it is.

2134
02:08:11,740 --> 02:08:14,540
Well hmm.
It's re,

2135
02:08:14,590 --> 02:08:19,590
it's a thrill to encounter a kind of 
means to a metaphysical system that's so

2136
02:08:24,220 --> 02:08:29,220
persuasive and potent and I hadn't 
really experienced that a whole lot in 

2137
02:08:29,231 --> 02:08:29,710
my life.

2138
02:08:30,050 --> 02:08:32,380
Huh?
That's what universities are supposed to

2139
02:08:32,381 --> 02:08:35,680
do for people.
That's what universities are supposed to

2140
02:08:35,681 --> 02:08:40,681
do for people.
They're not supposed to take people who 

2141
02:08:40,681 --> 02:08:41,500
are barely hanging together and break 
them and make them weak.

2142
02:08:41,950 --> 02:08:44,920
They're supposed to equate them with the
heroic,

2143
02:08:46,010 --> 02:08:50,830
heroic substructure of the human psyche 
so that they can move out into the world

2144
02:08:50,831 --> 02:08:54,180
and thrive and it's an absolute crime 
that,

2145
02:08:54,181 --> 02:08:56,920
that isn't what's happening.
So Hooray for that.

2146
02:08:57,490 --> 02:09:02,490
Thank you.

2147
02:09:04,850 --> 02:09:09,170
It occurred to me that they kind of 
tradition and genre that you are working

2148
02:09:09,620 --> 02:09:13,730
in here.
Is that of the sermon now?

2149
02:09:13,731 --> 02:09:15,920
Are you comfortable with that 
categorization and

2150
02:09:17,510 --> 02:09:18,860
we'll see where you go with it.

2151
02:09:20,230 --> 02:09:20,610
Well,
that's,

2152
02:09:20,730 --> 02:09:22,230
that's the essence of my question.
I mean,

2153
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:25,560
are these sermons and might know.

2154
02:09:26,870 --> 02:09:28,480
I don't know.
Sorry.

2155
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:30,890
I love it.
The last night one call you a preacher.

2156
02:09:31,410 --> 02:09:32,690
Well,
you can certainly call me.

2157
02:09:32,691 --> 02:09:33,860
Why didn't,
you know?

2158
02:09:34,100 --> 02:09:37,540
Um,
I think that there,

2159
02:09:37,590 --> 02:09:42,590
there,
there's a certain overlap and the 

2160
02:09:42,590 --> 02:09:44,531
overlap,
but this has been characteristic of my 

2161
02:09:44,531 --> 02:09:44,531
approach to education.
So right from the beginning,

2162
02:09:44,531 --> 02:09:46,010
because I have some rules about what I 
lecture,

2163
02:09:46,850 --> 02:09:50,420
what about the topics that I lecture 
about and the way that I deal with it.

2164
02:09:50,421 --> 02:09:54,140
So the first rule is I don't want to 
tell you anything that isn't useful.

2165
02:09:54,990 --> 02:09:56,450
I'm a pragmatist,
you know,

2166
02:09:56,451 --> 02:10:01,451
like I'm an American pragmatists.
That's part of my philosophical 

2167
02:10:01,451 --> 02:10:04,361
grounding and I believe that knowledge 
is tool like and that the proper thing 

2168
02:10:04,641 --> 02:10:09,641
to do is to to equip people with the 
tools to move effectively in the world 

2169
02:10:09,980 --> 02:10:14,980
and so I want to make sure that if I 
offer a story or a fact for that matter,

2170
02:10:15,771 --> 02:10:16,580
I also say,
well,

2171
02:10:16,581 --> 02:10:18,830
here,
here's why you need to know this fact.

2172
02:10:18,980 --> 02:10:23,180
It will actually improve your life or 
it'll stop you from wandering into a pit

2173
02:10:23,181 --> 02:10:28,181
which is approximately the same thing 
and then it will also knowing this will 

2174
02:10:28,181 --> 02:10:32,531
also make you more effective actor in 
the social world and that will improve 

2175
02:10:32,531 --> 02:10:32,540
the social world.
Right,

2176
02:10:32,541 --> 02:10:34,910
and hopefully will improve the 
environmental world,

2177
02:10:34,911 --> 02:10:35,810
et Cetera,
et cetera.

2178
02:10:36,170 --> 02:10:41,170
And so I would say to the degree that 
those who produce sermons are concerned 

2179
02:10:41,170 --> 02:10:45,020
with producing alterations in behavior,
which is our moral alterations.

2180
02:10:45,050 --> 02:10:48,080
Say then I share the same territory with
them,

2181
02:10:48,081 --> 02:10:53,081
but I wouldn't say that that's something
that should be only relegated to the 

2182
02:10:53,081 --> 02:10:55,580
domain of the sermon because I believe 
that it is the job of the universities.

2183
02:10:55,581 --> 02:10:58,910
For example,
especially in the damned humanities,

2184
02:10:59,390 --> 02:11:04,390
to ennoble people.
And to enable them to adopt the mantle 

2185
02:11:04,390 --> 02:11:08,771
of proper citizenship and that we've 
forgotten that we've forgotten that or 

2186
02:11:08,870 --> 02:11:12,230
we're avoiding it or refusing it or 
something like that,

2187
02:11:12,630 --> 02:11:15,230
you know,
and I think we're using the death of God

2188
02:11:15,231 --> 02:11:16,340
as an excuse.

2189
02:11:16,820 --> 02:11:20,090
So I think that to the degree that I'm a
preacher,

2190
02:11:20,091 --> 02:11:21,800
I'm making an error,
you know,

2191
02:11:21,801 --> 02:11:24,620
and also to the degree that I'm 
politicized,

2192
02:11:24,621 --> 02:11:25,640
I'm making an error.
I,

2193
02:11:25,850 --> 02:11:29,570
I'm wondering out of my proper territory
when that's the domain that I meant,

2194
02:11:29,990 --> 02:11:34,990
but when I'm attempting to assemble 
multiple layers of facts towards a 

2195
02:11:35,151 --> 02:11:40,151
practical end,
which is what I'm trying to do in the 

2196
02:11:40,151 --> 02:11:40,550
end,
is the enablement of the individual.

2197
02:11:40,551 --> 02:11:41,810
Right?
That's my goal.

2198
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:45,710
Then then I'm in my proper domain.
I'm going to make mistakes,

2199
02:11:45,711 --> 02:11:50,711
you know,
I'm going to wander out of my territory 

2200
02:11:50,711 --> 02:11:50,711
and I try not to do that.
But you know,

2201
02:11:50,711 --> 02:11:51,290
it's,
well,

2202
02:11:51,291 --> 02:11:53,690
it's part of being a fool.
You're going to make mistakes.

2203
02:11:53,780 --> 02:11:55,850
So yeah.
Thanks very much.

2204
02:11:56,200 --> 02:11:56,650
No problem.

2205
02:12:03,720 --> 02:12:07,010
Thanks for continuing to do all the cool
stuff that makes everyone love you.

2206
02:12:07,300 --> 02:12:09,420
That's great.
Not everyone will.

2207
02:12:09,421 --> 02:12:09,990
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2208
02:12:09,991 --> 02:12:11,490
yeah.
That's a generalization.

2209
02:12:11,790 --> 02:12:16,710
There's lots of people that seem not to 
love me and I can't blame really.

2210
02:12:17,820 --> 02:12:18,420
Anyway.
Yeah.

2211
02:12:18,421 --> 02:12:23,421
I'm going to lead into a question here.
So in your book maps book maps of 

2212
02:12:23,911 --> 02:12:25,580
meaning a,
uh,

2213
02:12:25,820 --> 02:12:30,180
you got that quote from,
does he ask you about how humankind,

2214
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:35,240
mankind,
if you give them all the cakes and the 

2215
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:35,240
world.
Oh my God.

2216
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:36,250
So yeah,
if you get all my

2217
02:12:36,300 --> 02:12:37,200
God is right,
man.

2218
02:12:37,201 --> 02:12:40,400
That's one killer quote.
That's from notes from the underground.

2219
02:12:40,401 --> 02:12:45,401
A.
Everyone should read that because 

2220
02:12:45,401 --> 02:12:47,241
everyone's underground and it's a great.
It's a great little journey through 

2221
02:12:47,241 --> 02:12:47,241
that.

2222
02:12:47,241 --> 02:12:48,600
Yeah.
So it's basically,

2223
02:12:48,610 --> 02:12:49,430
yeah,
if you give.

2224
02:12:49,640 --> 02:12:53,000
If you have the perfect utopia,
I often use this.

2225
02:12:53,060 --> 02:12:58,060
If you have the most perfect utopia,
humans will find a way to screw it up.

2226
02:12:59,540 --> 02:13:00,980
They'll go out of the.
Yeah,

2227
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:03,390
because we thought we liked,
we liked chaos and the unknown.

2228
02:13:03,391 --> 02:13:05,200
You've talked about this.
That's the

2229
02:13:05,200 --> 02:13:07,410
thing is,
is that were heroic adventurers,

2230
02:13:07,420 --> 02:13:08,440
right?
We're not,

2231
02:13:08,770 --> 02:13:12,460
we're not sybarites laying on a beach.
Although when you get the opportunity to

2232
02:13:12,461 --> 02:13:14,080
do that,
like make sure you take it,

2233
02:13:14,110 --> 02:13:15,910
but that's not what.
That's not,

2234
02:13:16,090 --> 02:13:18,460
that's not the proper calling of the 
human soul,

2235
02:13:18,461 --> 02:13:18,970
right?
We're,

2236
02:13:19,070 --> 02:13:23,380
we're out there to conquer chaos and the
unknown and it's in that we find meaning

2237
02:13:23,381 --> 02:13:26,170
and that's better than the utopia.
That's what Dostoevsky,

2238
02:13:26,650 --> 02:13:31,650
God bless his soul.
Dostoevsky had that he was such a 

2239
02:13:31,650 --> 02:13:35,221
genius.
He had everything that was wrong with 

2240
02:13:35,221 --> 02:13:35,610
communism,
figured out even before it started.

2241
02:13:35,910 --> 02:13:37,350
Amazing.
Really,

2242
02:13:37,351 --> 02:13:40,170
like if you read the possessed or the 
devil's,

2243
02:13:40,171 --> 02:13:42,840
which I would highly recommend,
although it's a hard book to get into,

2244
02:13:42,841 --> 02:13:44,610
it takes about 100 pages to read,
get,

2245
02:13:44,730 --> 02:13:45,570
get,
get,

2246
02:13:46,200 --> 02:13:47,040
get,
moving.

2247
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:52,460
But Dostoyevsky he talks.
His main character in that novel is a 

2248
02:13:52,460 --> 02:13:53,220
person who's,
again,

2249
02:13:53,221 --> 02:13:58,221
a very powerful person who's completely 
possessed by what's essentially the 

2250
02:13:58,221 --> 02:14:01,701
communist ideology and he's very 
effective at moving it forward and 

2251
02:14:01,701 --> 02:14:05,391
Dostoevsky lays out brilliantly exactly 
the catastrophic consequences of that 

2252
02:14:05,391 --> 02:14:08,670
both personally and socially.
And he did this like 30 years before the

2253
02:14:08,670 --> 02:14:09,210
Russian revolution.
It's just,

2254
02:14:09,390 --> 02:14:12,570
it's uncanny.
I don't know where the hell that guy was

2255
02:14:12,571 --> 02:14:14,610
from.
Must've been his epilepsy,

2256
02:14:14,611 --> 02:14:15,000
you know,

2257
02:14:15,500 --> 02:14:17,600
so yeah.
I'm glad I got you all excited.

2258
02:14:17,601 --> 02:14:20,480
I'm just gonna keep going here.
Basically,

2259
02:14:20,481 --> 02:14:22,200
I used to use that,
um,

2260
02:14:22,220 --> 02:14:23,450
you know,
it's kind of fleet to,

2261
02:14:23,451 --> 02:14:28,451
a lot of that comes from the left wing,
this utopia we're going towards with 

2262
02:14:28,451 --> 02:14:29,190
the,
with the universal income and it's gonna

2263
02:14:29,210 --> 02:14:34,210
be ai and suddenly the whole population 
is going to becoming insanely creative 

2264
02:14:34,210 --> 02:14:34,760
and with no incentive,
but it's not.

2265
02:14:35,210 --> 02:14:40,210
Utopia is not there.
It's not like this thing that hasn't 

2266
02:14:40,210 --> 02:14:40,210
happened yet.
We're in it,

2267
02:14:40,210 --> 02:14:41,330
we're in it.
This is the best thing ever.

2268
02:14:41,331 --> 02:14:44,510
And like all of humanity,
the Western civilization like,

2269
02:14:44,511 --> 02:14:49,511
oh my printing the material sense.
I mean it just toilet paper,

2270
02:14:49,700 --> 02:14:51,800
toilet paper just happened.
Anyway,

2271
02:14:52,010 --> 02:14:55,960
uh,
that's so serious.

2272
02:15:01,110 --> 02:15:03,240
So we have this beautiful thing and 
people are,

2273
02:15:03,250 --> 02:15:08,250
are,
are trying to take it down at all costs 

2274
02:15:08,250 --> 02:15:08,390
and now we go into the dark phase of my 
life,

2275
02:15:08,640 --> 02:15:13,640
into my question here,
which is actually goes into 

2276
02:15:13,640 --> 02:15:15,420
Charlottesville.
Had you know,

2277
02:15:15,730 --> 02:15:16,470
with,
with that,

2278
02:15:16,520 --> 02:15:21,520
with the,
with the initial purpose of protecting 

2279
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:21,520
the statue.

2280
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:23,180
Was it good thing?
I don't,

2281
02:15:23,181 --> 02:15:23,930
I'm not,
I'm not,

2282
02:15:23,960 --> 02:15:26,780
I don't know about confederacy except 
for the big thing,

2283
02:15:27,110 --> 02:15:30,260
but honestly it's a,
it's a slippery,

2284
02:15:30,261 --> 02:15:34,160
slippery slope.
And the confused souls who and the bad,

2285
02:15:34,250 --> 02:15:38,150
they just darkened soles for sure.
Not Good.

2286
02:15:38,450 --> 02:15:43,450
They screwed up big time because the 
purpose behind it is so important 

2287
02:15:43,450 --> 02:15:45,890
because it's going to be fought founding
fathers next.

2288
02:15:45,891 --> 02:15:50,891
Anyone who ever contributed anything to 
Western civilization as we know it is 

2289
02:15:50,891 --> 02:15:50,990
already being.
It's already being done.

2290
02:15:50,991 --> 02:15:55,991
James Madison High School in the states.
It's getting renamed because some girls 

2291
02:15:56,031 --> 02:15:58,250
from random,
one student felt unsafe.

2292
02:15:58,460 --> 02:16:00,830
And so yeah,
this is a serious issue.

2293
02:16:00,831 --> 02:16:05,831
And I wanted like,
I feel like we're really up against the 

2294
02:16:05,831 --> 02:16:06,710
wall now because now they found they're 
Nazis,

2295
02:16:06,711 --> 02:16:08,960
man.
The Nazis are flooding the streets now.

2296
02:16:08,961 --> 02:16:11,690
So how do we,
how do we possibly,

2297
02:16:11,750 --> 02:16:13,910
you know,
kind of save our cakes.

2298
02:16:24,300 --> 02:16:25,590
You had to bring it up,
didn't ya?

2299
02:16:33,890 --> 02:16:38,890
Well,
having the right degenerate into 

2300
02:16:38,890 --> 02:16:38,890
identity politics does not seem to be a 
part,

2301
02:16:38,890 --> 02:16:43,860
a positive solution.
So one of the things I would say is 

2302
02:16:43,860 --> 02:16:46,331
that,
like I understand why the identity 

2303
02:16:46,331 --> 02:16:49,060
politics that is being practiced so 
assiduously and so devastating,

2304
02:16:49,070 --> 02:16:52,730
Lee by the left has been cooptive by the
right.

2305
02:16:52,940 --> 02:16:57,940
I understand that.
But then here's what I would say to the 

2306
02:16:57,940 --> 02:16:58,490
people on the right who are playing that
game.

2307
02:16:59,840 --> 02:17:03,230
If you play the game of your enemies and
you win,

2308
02:17:03,740 --> 02:17:06,710
you win their game,
you don't win.

2309
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:12,040
That's not victory.
You just become the most successful 

2310
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:14,450
exponent of their pathology was.
How was that a good thing?

2311
02:17:14,720 --> 02:17:19,610
It's a bad thing.
So what does that leave people as old as

2312
02:17:19,611 --> 02:17:21,740
an alternative?
Well,

2313
02:17:22,970 --> 02:17:26,210
I don't think that the Caucasians,
let's say,

2314
02:17:26,270 --> 02:17:30,860
should revert to being white.
I think that's a bad idea.

2315
02:17:31,160 --> 02:17:36,160
It's a dangerous idea and it's coming 
fast and I don't like to see that.

2316
02:17:37,370 --> 02:17:42,370
I think the whole group identity thing 
is seriously pathological.

2317
02:17:42,920 --> 02:17:45,140
I think we've made big mistakes in 
Canada.

2318
02:17:45,590 --> 02:17:50,590
I understand why at least to some degree
in that respect and that large mistakes 

2319
02:17:50,590 --> 02:17:55,391
are being made all over the western 
world where we're making your group 

2320
02:17:55,391 --> 02:17:57,470
identity the most important thing about 
you.

2321
02:17:58,010 --> 02:18:02,690
I think that's reprehensible.
I think it's devastating.

2322
02:18:02,840 --> 02:18:05,690
I think it's genocidal in its ultimate 
expression.

2323
02:18:05,930 --> 02:18:09,320
I think it will bring down our 
civilization if we pursue it.

2324
02:18:10,900 --> 02:18:14,830
We shouldn't be playing that game.
So what's the alternative?

2325
02:18:14,950 --> 02:18:19,950
You know,
I've thought for a long time about a 

2326
02:18:19,950 --> 02:18:20,770
political career really forever since I 
was like 12,

2327
02:18:20,830 --> 02:18:25,830
really for a long time and I've always 
decided against it because it seemed to 

2328
02:18:25,830 --> 02:18:30,721
me that the proper level of analysis 
with regards to the solution of the 

2329
02:18:30,791 --> 02:18:32,980
problem that we're facing isn't 
political.

2330
02:18:33,130 --> 02:18:38,130
And that's why I think it's a mistake 
when what I'm doing gets politicized 

2331
02:18:38,130 --> 02:18:41,881
either by me or others.
I think that the way that you deal with 

2332
02:18:41,881 --> 02:18:45,931
this is to put yourself together.
I really believe that is that because I 

2333
02:18:45,931 --> 02:18:47,890
think that individual people are far 
more powerful.

2334
02:18:47,891 --> 02:18:50,590
There's certainly far more evil than 
they're willing to consider,

2335
02:18:50,770 --> 02:18:53,500
but that's also a sign of their 
unbelievable power.

2336
02:18:54,400 --> 02:18:59,400
So I think that what you do is you aim 
high and put yourself together and stay 

2337
02:19:01,211 --> 02:19:05,050
the hell away from the idiot logs 
because they're hiding.

2338
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:10,260
They're hiding behind a wall.
They're not able to come out and fight 

2339
02:19:10,260 --> 02:19:13,381
on their own behalf.
And so the way forward through the of 

2340
02:19:13,381 --> 02:19:17,490
the logical mass,
and that's the lesson of Western 

2341
02:19:17,490 --> 02:19:19,831
culture,
is to place the individual at the place 

2342
02:19:19,831 --> 02:19:23,281
of paramount importance and to make the 
group identity emerge only when 

2343
02:19:23,351 --> 02:19:26,530
necessary and secondarily,
if ever.

2344
02:19:27,410 --> 02:19:29,630
And so you can do that.
You can do that now.

2345
02:19:29,631 --> 02:19:32,090
You can do that tomorrow.
Like you can put your life together.

2346
02:19:32,091 --> 02:19:32,730
And again,
as,

2347
02:19:32,810 --> 02:19:35,750
as I mentioned to the other young man 
who asked the question is,

2348
02:19:36,140 --> 02:19:38,660
you won't hurt anyone doing that,
right?

2349
02:19:38,870 --> 02:19:42,380
You pick up your goddamn responsibility,
certain yourself out,

2350
02:19:42,440 --> 02:19:44,300
fix up your family,
right?

2351
02:19:44,480 --> 02:19:46,670
And then you can be a force for good in 
the culture.

2352
02:19:46,790 --> 02:19:51,790
And if enough people do that,
the ideological mass will just 

2353
02:19:51,790 --> 02:19:51,790
evaporate.
It'll just disappear.

2354
02:19:51,890 --> 02:19:56,890
I think that's the way you show people 
the right path forward to is that you 

2355
02:19:56,890 --> 02:19:56,890
say,
well,

2356
02:19:56,890 --> 02:19:56,890
look,
um,

2357
02:19:57,230 --> 02:19:59,150
we would like,
we would like it so much.

2358
02:19:59,151 --> 02:20:03,740
If you could thrive as an individual,
drop your cult like affiliation,

2359
02:20:03,830 --> 02:20:05,780
right?
Step out of the shadows,

2360
02:20:05,781 --> 02:20:10,781
the demonic shadows your ideological 
possession and step forward as a fully 

2361
02:20:11,331 --> 02:20:15,200
developed person into the light.
Do it by example.

2362
02:20:15,410 --> 02:20:17,990
That's your,
that's your best Batman.

2363
02:20:18,590 --> 02:20:20,390
So that's what it looks like to me.

2364
02:20:23,820 --> 02:20:28,820
Thank you.

2365
02:20:31,780 --> 02:20:34,140
I'm going to take one more question and 
then I'm going to.

2366
02:20:34,210 --> 02:20:38,400
There is a young man from Kentucky here.
Brian,

2367
02:20:39,050 --> 02:20:41,500
it's Brian here.
Okay.

2368
02:20:41,501 --> 02:20:46,501
So I'm going to answer one more question
and then I'm going to let you take the 

2369
02:20:46,501 --> 02:20:46,501
mic.
Okay.

2370
02:20:46,501 --> 02:20:46,600
All right.

2371
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:49,310
Good evening,
Dr Peterson.

2372
02:20:49,311 --> 02:20:54,311
Good evening everybody.
I also want to thank you first for your 

2373
02:20:54,311 --> 02:20:57,350
lectures that I've been following on 
youtube mainly and to say that they have

2374
02:20:57,351 --> 02:21:01,130
been life changing wouldn't be an 
overstatement.

2375
02:21:02,120 --> 02:21:07,120
Great man.
And I'm one of the crazy people 

2376
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:09,761
increasing your views on youtube because
I flew in from Belgium last night to be 

2377
02:21:09,761 --> 02:21:09,770
here

2378
02:21:15,630 --> 02:21:18,140
for me.
Right?

2379
02:21:18,240 --> 02:21:18,410
Right

2380
02:21:18,410 --> 02:21:20,580
now.
And English is not my first language.

2381
02:21:20,581 --> 02:21:24,100
So bear with me.
Um,

2382
02:21:24,700 --> 02:21:29,700
I,
I would have many burning questions to 

2383
02:21:29,700 --> 02:21:32,871
ask you,
but I thought it was fair and necessary 

2384
02:21:32,871 --> 02:21:35,601
to pick one and it would be this one.
There are concepts that recur in your 

2385
02:21:35,851 --> 02:21:40,851
lectures,
but this one you only mentioned once in 

2386
02:21:40,851 --> 02:21:43,971
your early videos on bill 16.
I'm about self esteem.

2387
02:21:44,100 --> 02:21:47,310
You said you don't believe in the 
existence of self esteem,

2388
02:21:47,340 --> 02:21:49,470
the wind to teach children.
They're all special.

2389
02:21:49,471 --> 02:21:54,471
You think you boost their confidence,
but the only result is that some get 

2390
02:21:54,471 --> 02:21:57,930
narcissistic.
The reason why I'm interested in that is

2391
02:21:57,931 --> 02:22:02,931
about standing up for yourself and it 
is,

2392
02:22:03,720 --> 02:22:06,810
and when I tried to,
you know,

2393
02:22:07,410 --> 02:22:08,860
do it.
Yep.

2394
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:14,000
I see that I'm rational arguments.
Faith in rationality doesn't get the 

2395
02:22:16,171 --> 02:22:21,171
best results in negotiations.
That's why you learn how to be 

2396
02:22:21,171 --> 02:22:24,030
socialized by playing rough and tumble.

2397
02:22:24,510 --> 02:22:28,500
It's not an intellectual conversation 
that gets you socialized.

2398
02:22:29,010 --> 02:22:34,010
So I'm also reading that book is 
suggested about a by Steven Hicks 

2399
02:22:34,010 --> 02:22:38,450
explaining postmodernism because I 
wasn't really familiar and I've been 

2400
02:22:38,450 --> 02:22:39,330
listening to a lot for talking to him 
later this week.

2401
02:22:39,331 --> 02:22:44,331
So that might be fun and I'm trying to 
read with fresh eyes because I've been 

2402
02:22:44,550 --> 02:22:49,550
indoctrinated by you of course are very 
critical and there's one more point that

2403
02:22:50,161 --> 02:22:55,161
I have to agree with the postmodernist 
and that is the world seems to me as I 

2404
02:22:56,671 --> 02:23:00,450
observe it,
a place where powers are play.

2405
02:23:01,140 --> 02:23:03,210
It's not rationality.
Delete that.

2406
02:23:03,570 --> 02:23:08,280
So when I'm in a weak position and I 
want to fight back not to get resentful,

2407
02:23:08,820 --> 02:23:13,110
I find that it's not a rational argument
that will get me there.

2408
02:23:13,140 --> 02:23:16,200
There's something else that I don't do 
and that I should be doing it.

2409
02:23:16,201 --> 02:23:17,540
I don't know what it is.
Right?

2410
02:23:18,150 --> 02:23:22,080
So you see the relationship with self 
esteem seems to me that people who think

2411
02:23:22,081 --> 02:23:25,850
of themselves start in a better position
in,

2412
02:23:26,090 --> 02:23:26,970
in this game.

2413
02:23:27,010 --> 02:23:27,720
Okay.
So.

2414
02:23:27,721 --> 02:23:28,620
Okay.
Okay,

2415
02:23:28,680 --> 02:23:29,390
great.
Yup.

2416
02:23:29,580 --> 02:23:31,350
Alright.
So there's a lot in that question.

2417
02:23:31,351 --> 02:23:36,351
So the first thing is,
is there's a problem with the 

2418
02:23:36,351 --> 02:23:39,651
measurement of self esteem and that 
actually matters because self esteem is 

2419
02:23:39,651 --> 02:23:42,030
a psychological concept,
a scientific concept if you like,

2420
02:23:42,300 --> 02:23:47,300
and you have to get the measurement 
right and you can predict self esteem 

2421
02:23:47,300 --> 02:23:50,631
almost perfectly by measuring someone's 
extroversion and subtracting from that.

2422
02:23:51,031 --> 02:23:53,160
They're negative emotionality or 
neuroticism.

2423
02:23:53,161 --> 02:23:55,650
So it's actually just a combination of 
big five traits.

2424
02:23:55,651 --> 02:24:00,651
And so people who are extroverted,
who feel a lot of positive emotion and 

2425
02:24:00,651 --> 02:24:04,770
who are and who don't feel a lot of 
negative emotion score high on scales of

2426
02:24:04,771 --> 02:24:06,630
self esteem.
Okay.

2427
02:24:06,660 --> 02:24:11,660
So conceptually it's a nonstarter 
because you're not going to move 

2428
02:24:13,441 --> 02:24:15,900
people's levels of neuroticism,
let's say,

2429
02:24:16,050 --> 02:24:18,600
by trying to get them to feel good about
themselves.

2430
02:24:19,050 --> 02:24:21,180
Okay?
Now having said that,

2431
02:24:21,210 --> 02:24:24,660
that doesn't mean that you shouldn't 
encourage people.

2432
02:24:25,050 --> 02:24:30,050
Right now,
there's this psychologist named Jerome 

2433
02:24:30,050 --> 02:24:32,220
Kagan who's quite a great psychologist,
developmental psychologist.

2434
02:24:32,650 --> 02:24:34,740
I think he's an emeritus at Harvard,
at the,

2435
02:24:34,980 --> 02:24:38,510
at the,
at the moment he studied temperamentally

2436
02:24:38,520 --> 02:24:40,230
inhibited children.
Uh,

2437
02:24:40,390 --> 02:24:45,390
you can.
So they are basically kids who are high 

2438
02:24:45,390 --> 02:24:45,390
in neuroticism,
probably low in extroversion.

2439
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:50,600
And he found that if those children,
you can identify them as early as six 

2440
02:24:50,600 --> 02:24:50,600
months,
right?

2441
02:24:50,600 --> 02:24:52,170
It's very,
very inculcated in their temperament.

2442
02:24:52,620 --> 02:24:57,620
Um,
he found that if you encouraged them in 

2443
02:24:57,620 --> 02:25:01,101
the world,
you could shift them into a more stable 

2444
02:25:01,101 --> 02:25:02,760
personality configuration.
And what you basically did was when they

2445
02:25:02,761 --> 02:25:07,761
were manifesting signs of distress,
instead of encouraging them to withdraw 

2446
02:25:07,761 --> 02:25:12,621
and retreat,
which is what they might be attempting 

2447
02:25:12,621 --> 02:25:15,441
to do,
you encourage them to go out and 

2448
02:25:15,441 --> 02:25:15,441
explore.
So for example,

2449
02:25:15,441 --> 02:25:19,431
if you have a temperamentally inhibited 
Charles and you go to a playground and 

2450
02:25:19,431 --> 02:25:19,830
there's kids out there,
like if you have an extroverted,

2451
02:25:19,831 --> 02:25:22,740
emotionally stable kid,
three years old,

2452
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:26,440
as you put them on the ground,
their feet are already moving,

2453
02:25:26,470 --> 02:25:26,770
right?

2454
02:25:26,770 --> 02:25:30,160
Like a puppy over water and you let them
go and they just run to the,

2455
02:25:30,450 --> 02:25:33,250
to the kits and they're there and then 
you have to drag them away.

2456
02:25:33,460 --> 02:25:35,290
But if you ever temperamentally 
inhibited child,

2457
02:25:35,291 --> 02:25:40,291
the child will sort of stand around your
legs and sort of peek out and then what 

2458
02:25:40,291 --> 02:25:43,540
you do is wait it out,
let them watch,

2459
02:25:43,810 --> 02:25:47,170
encourage them to move a little bit 
forward and encourage them to take their

2460
02:25:47,171 --> 02:25:49,810
steps out into the unknown and the 
strange land.

2461
02:25:50,170 --> 02:25:53,140
And don't let them withdraw like you can
do it.

2462
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:54,700
You have.
They're slower to warm up,

2463
02:25:54,701 --> 02:25:56,200
they'll warm up,
they'll habituate,

2464
02:25:56,470 --> 02:26:01,470
and if you continually expose you're 
inhibited child to the things that make 

2465
02:26:01,751 --> 02:26:06,751
them anxious in measured doses,
then you can transform their 

2466
02:26:06,751 --> 02:26:09,991
psychophysiological temperament.
Now you're probably not going to shift 

2467
02:26:09,991 --> 02:26:10,510
them way the hell out onto the 
extroverted,

2468
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:14,110
emotionally stable land,
but you can make a big difference that's

2469
02:26:14,111 --> 02:26:17,020
very different than making them feel 
good about themselves,

2470
02:26:17,230 --> 02:26:20,320
which is such a need to curse.

2471
02:26:20,470 --> 02:26:23,230
You need to curse when you discuss that 
concept.

2472
02:26:23,710 --> 02:26:28,710
Right?
So it isn't the improved their self 

2473
02:26:28,710 --> 02:26:29,650
esteem,
it isn't how you feel about yourself,

2474
02:26:29,651 --> 02:26:34,651
right?
It's how you act effectively in the 

2475
02:26:34,651 --> 02:26:34,780
world and how you're trained to do that.
So.

2476
02:26:34,840 --> 02:26:39,840
Okay.
Now then you were talking about 

2477
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:39,840
negotiation,
right?

2478
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:39,840
And you said,
well don't.

2479
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:44,310
You said something like,
don't people who feel good about 

2480
02:26:44,310 --> 02:26:44,890
themselves aren't they able to negotiate
better and it's.

2481
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:47,170
I know that's a poor paraphrase,
excuse me,

2482
02:26:47,171 --> 02:26:52,030
but I'm in negotiations actually a 
practical issue to some degree,

2483
02:26:52,090 --> 02:26:57,090
like the first thing is that you have to
figure out what you want because you 

2484
02:26:57,090 --> 02:26:57,090
were saying,
well,

2485
02:26:57,090 --> 02:26:57,610
it's not merely rational.
It's like,

2486
02:26:57,611 --> 02:26:58,030
yeah,
yeah,

2487
02:26:58,031 --> 02:27:03,031
that's for sure.
You have to bargain from a position of 

2488
02:27:03,031 --> 02:27:03,031
authority.
Let's say not power.

2489
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:08,120
Authority is a better word,
but you don't have authority unless you 

2490
02:27:08,120 --> 02:27:09,400
know what you're talking about and 
unless you can bring some.

2491
02:27:10,060 --> 02:27:12,660
Unless you can bring some,
let's say force.

2492
02:27:12,670 --> 02:27:14,140
It's not,
that's not the right word.

2493
02:27:16,270 --> 02:27:21,270
You can negotiate without anyone unless 
you can say no and you can't say no 

2494
02:27:21,371 --> 02:27:23,410
unless you've set yourself up with 
alternatives.

2495
02:27:23,950 --> 02:27:26,860
So when you go to your boss and you 
negotiate for a raise,

2496
02:27:27,160 --> 02:27:32,160
you need to have the sort of CV that 
enables you to go find another job and 

2497
02:27:32,160 --> 02:27:35,701
you have to have your cv prepared and 
you have to have looked for another job 

2498
02:27:35,701 --> 02:27:39,270
and you have to be able to get one 
because then you can go in there and 

2499
02:27:39,270 --> 02:27:39,270
say,
I'm.

2500
02:27:39,270 --> 02:27:43,300
I'm not as productive as I could be at 
my current level of remuneration.

2501
02:27:43,420 --> 02:27:46,440
It's not reflective of what I'm able to 
do and a,

2502
02:27:46,510 --> 02:27:49,090
I want this and this is what will happen
if you give me this.

2503
02:27:49,091 --> 02:27:52,090
This will be the good things that will 
happen and what do you think of that?

2504
02:27:52,120 --> 02:27:57,120
And the person is going to know.
Even by the way that you hold yourself 

2505
02:27:57,120 --> 02:28:01,891
while you're having the discussion,
whether or not you're someone with 

2506
02:28:01,891 --> 02:28:03,190
options and you can't fake that while 
you can,

2507
02:28:03,220 --> 02:28:06,610
but it's not helpful like it just 
doesn't work for very many iterations.

2508
02:28:06,880 --> 02:28:08,410
You have to.
It's it's.

2509
02:28:08,470 --> 02:28:11,380
It's not rational.
You're preparing yourself for battle.

2510
02:28:11,590 --> 02:28:14,630
That's what you're doing and you can't 
be weak when you prefer it.

2511
02:28:14,640 --> 02:28:17,320
Prepare yourself for battle because if 
the person says,

2512
02:28:17,321 --> 02:28:19,990
no,
I'm not giving you a raise,

2513
02:28:19,991 --> 02:28:22,000
which is exactly what they should say 
because what are they going

2514
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,810
to do?
Just like sprinkled the money around.

2515
02:28:24,230 --> 02:28:26,030
You need to be able to say,
okay,

2516
02:28:26,031 --> 02:28:31,031
then there will be consequences that you
don't like and that's what it means to 

2517
02:28:31,521 --> 02:28:35,330
say no to someone.
No means if you continue to push this,

2518
02:28:35,510 --> 02:28:38,150
things will happen that you don't like.
Now in that case,

2519
02:28:38,151 --> 02:28:43,151
it will be all depart and take my 
talents with me and if they don't care 

2520
02:28:43,151 --> 02:28:46,961
well then you're in the wrong business 
or you don't have any talents to begin 

2521
02:28:46,961 --> 02:28:46,961
with.
Right?

2522
02:28:46,961 --> 02:28:49,310
Which is so in order to negotiate 
properly,

2523
02:28:49,340 --> 02:28:51,710
and this is more difficult for people 
who are agreeable,

2524
02:28:51,711 --> 02:28:56,711
for example,
because there tend to be more conflict 

2525
02:28:56,711 --> 02:28:58,841
averse.
You have to put yourself in a position 

2526
02:28:58,841 --> 02:29:02,230
where you can,
you can push back as hard as you're 

2527
02:29:02,230 --> 02:29:03,910
going to be pushed on,
and that means you have to open your.

2528
02:29:03,970 --> 02:29:08,970
You have to open up your space of 
available options because otherwise the 

2529
02:29:08,970 --> 02:29:10,610
person says no,
and that's it.

2530
02:29:10,790 --> 02:29:12,740
You're done.
While you'll lose them.

2531
02:29:13,450 --> 02:29:15,110
It's,
it's as straightforward as that.

2532
02:29:15,620 --> 02:29:20,620
Now with regards to the self esteem part
is practice on small things because you 

2533
02:29:21,471 --> 02:29:23,390
build the skills.
Forget about the self esteem.

2534
02:29:23,391 --> 02:29:26,210
It isn't about being confident or 
feeling confident or any of that.

2535
02:29:26,450 --> 02:29:28,460
It's about knowing bloody well how to 
negotiate.

2536
02:29:28,730 --> 02:29:33,730
Start with small things you know,
so you'll notice that there are things 

2537
02:29:33,730 --> 02:29:37,721
in your relationships in particular that
aren't the way you want them to be and 

2538
02:29:37,721 --> 02:29:38,300
that you could see how could be 
improved.

2539
02:29:38,360 --> 02:29:40,460
It's like figuring out how they can be 
improved.

2540
02:29:40,670 --> 02:29:43,670
Negotiate with your partner,
make the incremental improvement.

2541
02:29:43,700 --> 02:29:48,700
Keep doing that.
You'll get better and better at it and 

2542
02:29:48,700 --> 02:29:49,220
then you'll be able to go out and have a
harder negotiation in the world.

2543
02:29:49,760 --> 02:29:53,420
So it's a set of skills.
There's an attitude behind it,

2544
02:29:53,421 --> 02:29:58,421
you know,
and it's easier for some people than 

2545
02:29:58,421 --> 02:29:58,421
others.
But fundamentally it's a set of skills.

2546
02:30:00,120 --> 02:30:00,750
No problem.

2547
02:30:06,310 --> 02:30:09,370
All right,
so now we have something interesting and

2548
02:30:09,371 --> 02:30:14,080
unexpected to close this off with.
The floor is yours.

2549
02:30:14,500 --> 02:30:15,570
Uh,
Dr Peterson,

2550
02:30:15,571 --> 02:30:20,571
I'd like to say thank you for making 
your videos available online.

2551
02:30:22,170 --> 02:30:24,840
They've had a great effect on me over 
the last year.

2552
02:30:25,090 --> 02:30:30,090
Actually found them a few years ago,
but sometime around July or August of 

2553
02:30:30,090 --> 02:30:31,350
last year,
I got hooked.

2554
02:30:34,140 --> 02:30:39,140
I would wake up at like 5:00
AM in the morning to watch your maps of 

2555
02:30:39,140 --> 02:30:40,290
meaning releases the new ones,
the old ones,

2556
02:30:40,350 --> 02:30:41,130
et,
etc.

2557
02:30:41,740 --> 02:30:46,740
Um,
I found myself inspired by both the 

2558
02:30:46,740 --> 02:30:51,171
academic and technicals a material as 
well as what I might term the more 

2559
02:30:51,300 --> 02:30:56,300
fatherly directives or wisdom.
I shared this with my family and my 

2560
02:30:56,311 --> 02:30:59,250
friends as well as my girlfriend.
She's here tonight as well.

2561
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:01,170
She's been following the biblical 
series.

2562
02:31:03,180 --> 02:31:08,180
BUt what I'd like to say is,
thank you for inspiring me to stand up 

2563
02:31:08,180 --> 02:31:12,720
and face something that I've been afraid
of all my adult life.

2564
02:31:13,740 --> 02:31:17,160
And thank you for granting me the 
permission to ask this question here.

2565
02:31:17,670 --> 02:31:21,690
It's actually for my girlfriend.
Will you please stand up?

2566
02:31:28,440 --> 02:31:33,440
So some might say,
gIven that we are a couple of primates 

2567
02:31:33,440 --> 02:31:37,651
full of snakes,
it's pretty miraculous that we haven't 

2568
02:31:37,651 --> 02:31:39,661
killed each other,
but I think you're pretty great and 

2569
02:31:43,030 --> 02:31:46,540
we've been talking about commitment and 
I think I'm ready.

2570
02:31:47,460 --> 02:31:51,490
I know I'm ready to commit to a life 
with you.

2571
02:31:52,390 --> 02:31:56,980
Have sorting ourselves out.
I'd like to clean some rooms with you.

2572
02:31:59,550 --> 02:32:04,550
Thank you.

2573
02:32:07,910 --> 02:32:12,910
And even as scary as the shackles of 
marriage have been made to seem to us,

2574
02:32:15,530 --> 02:32:19,880
um,
I'm thinking about forever and simply in

2575
02:32:19,881 --> 02:32:20,900
my,
in my words,

2576
02:32:22,490 --> 02:32:25,100
I love you dearly.
You feel like home.

2577
02:32:25,640 --> 02:32:27,920
I never want to lose that.
Will you marry me?

2578
02:32:28,070 --> 02:32:29,270
And if you want to come here,

2579
02:32:37,520 --> 02:32:42,520
thank you.
Thank you.

2580
02:32:50,590 --> 02:32:53,010
So you're seeing,
you're going to shackle yourself to me.

2581
02:32:53,011 --> 02:32:58,011
I'd never run away then I shall suffer 
the rest of my life with you.

2582
02:33:01,150 --> 02:33:06,150
Thank you.
Thank you.
