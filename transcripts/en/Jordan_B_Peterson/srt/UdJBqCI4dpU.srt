1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,520
There are coffees that have the drawings
as well.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,230
Okay,
so you should have 343 pages and how,

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,940
how many drones are there?
Susan,

4
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:11,040
you have the many of drawings at the 
back of your book

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,400
for four drawings
living in the middle.

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,680
Oh,
oh yeah,

7
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:26,520
those,
that's different,

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,330
right.
We'll do the origin the way

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,593
you might want to put those into the 
backs of your book because that's what 

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,250
you're supposed to be.
Well that's good.

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,460
That looks like everybody.
So at 14 people,

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,980
so that's a good stuff.
Okay,

13
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:54,981
so I'm going to lecture for awhile and 
then what you should have read today was

14
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,013
the preface of the thing that you picked
up from noman coffee and the first 

15
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:05,760
chapter which is called maps of 
experience.

16
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,083
In terms of this book,
you should be reading it now and also 

17
00:01:16,991 --> 00:01:21,590
for the next class.
We'll go over this in some detail too,

18
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,980
so,
so I'll start,

19
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,560
if you have any questions,
feel free to ask them.

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,633
I'll try to leave at least half an hour 
up to hand open for general discussion 

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,490
and really like,
you know,

22
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,473
feel free to stop me at any point if 
what I'm saying doesn't make any sense 

23
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:46,560
or if you have some relevant associated 
issue.

24
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,533
Okay.
Now the first thing we have to figure 

25
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:55,920
out basically is what it is that we're 
talking about in this course.

26
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,233
And uh,
that's so we have to establish the 

27
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:01,254
domain of inquiry.
That's basically the purpose of today's 

28
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:05,310
lecture.
Um,

29
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,770
the reason I got interested in this sort
of thing as I mentioned to you last week

30
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:11,604
was because I am interested in figuring 
out why people are motivated to commit 

31
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:16,044
acts of aggression.
Really atrocious acts of aggression 

32
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:21,210
because that's the kind of I'm really 
interested in in defense of their,

33
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,040
of their belief systems.

34
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,610
Probably mast if you can pull in 
somewhere over there because they needed

35
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:32,444
a closer with you.
So if you guys could just cram together 

36
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:37,530
a bit,
if you would,

37
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:41,170
maybe we
get a few more people in here.

38
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,873
Okay.
Now,

39
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,200
once again,
does everybody here have,

40
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:53,220
is some of us
okay?

41
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,870
And does everybody have this book?
Okay.

42
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:01,130
Is there anybody that wants this book?
Okay.

43
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,800
All right.
Hi

44
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,300
Noman
coffee.

45
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,150
If you talked to the people that have a 
clue,

46
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:43,984
they're binding it.
People have been getting bound copies 

47
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:50,260
and if you don't get a phone call,
tell them it's supposed to be filed.

48
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,273
Okay.
Cause you don't want to pack that thing 

49
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:56,210
around them about,
yeah,

50
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,800
I know they're doing the Mona order only
basis now.

51
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,170
Yeah.
Although I ordered eight for the

52
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,790
copies.
Yeah.

53
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,993
Yeah.
Well I didn't expect to get rid of 45 

54
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,003
coffee.
So did you get one that didn't have any 

55
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,520
high order?
That's what they're doing now.

56
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,330
No,
I also teach it at the extension school.

57
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,760
Oh,
okay.

58
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,553
Okay.
So we're done with procedural issues 

59
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,840
theoretically.
Okay.

60
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,150
Okay.
Well reverse myself here again.

61
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,610
Okay.
So what we're going to talk about today,

62
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,953
let's start the story again.
I got interested in what I'm going to 

63
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:41,554
teach you about cause I was interested 
in looking at motivation for social 

64
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,374
conflict.
Maybe I can get you to shut the door so 

65
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,850
disturb the whole smaller
Illinois

66
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,510
with regards to the videotape.
If you can ignore it,

67
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,430
that would be best.
There's no real purpose to it.

68
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:15,460
I want the videotape.
So it's not like you're going to be,

69
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,290
your comments are going to be one of the
children.

70
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,630
Anyone tried to just know to worry about
it.

71
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,570
Right
when I started giving some consideration

72
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:31,800
to the problem of motivation for social 
conflict.

73
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,543
So I was interested in why people become
rigid in their ideological 

74
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:39,940
identifications and their cultural 
identities.

75
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,500
And I was interested in really why 
individuals do that.

76
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,363
So I started to get interested in what 
role social identity plays in 

77
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,860
information processing,
which is hence the title of this course,

78
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:51,694
which is kind of wording and useless.
But the thing is everyone knows that we 

79
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:58,590
have social identities and ideological 
identities.

80
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,900
They're religious,
their cultural,

81
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,010
their intellectual,
whatever.

82
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:06,170
But nobody's really paid much attention 
to study how the representations of that

83
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:07,820
cultural identity,
uh,

84
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,290
alter the manner in which we,
we feel emotion,

85
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,124
which perceive and by which we act.
I'm interested in how our internal 

86
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:20,840
representations of our culture modulator
or emotional expression,

87
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,820
that's the best way to point and say you
know,

88
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:25,640
your brain basically is programmed as 
you're socialized.

89
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,523
That's what socialization is for and 
obviously it's socialization that 

90
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:30,884
instills cultural identity and equally 
obviously the process of socialization 

91
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:35,384
that leads to cultural identity must 
have some impact on the way you think 

92
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:38,984
and obviously leave that on the way that
your mind functions and the way that 

93
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:43,304
your brain functions and see North 
American neuropsychologists have been 

94
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:48,494
loath to give any consideration to this 
sort of notion to think that cultural 

95
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,244
transformations might have some direct 
impact on physiological function by the 

96
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,570
time the Russians.
By contrast,

97
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:00,404
this has been a central tenant of their 
nurses neuropsychological theories 

98
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,254
basically since since day one.
This is particularly true with regards 

99
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:09,680
to Alexander Luria and uh,
uh,

100
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,130
what's his name,
the gods scheme.

101
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,700
Now you can think about this,
it's quite obvious if you think about it

102
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,290
for a second with regards to something 
like the,

103
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,880
the capacity to read silently.
Now here's the case that,

104
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,280
well this is a relatively new talent.

105
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,200
I mean literacy is a new talent,
right?

106
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,330
Most people weren't able to read 500 
years ago.

107
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:32,810
It's only been 500 years and only for a 
little bit of that,

108
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,853
that the capacity to read has been 
widespread and the capacity to read 

109
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:41,390
silently is a relatively new development
in human history.

110
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:42,224
Now.
It's a cute your thing if you think 

111
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:45,080
about it,
that nonetheless,

112
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,160
the capacity to read silently localizes 
to a specific part of the brain,

113
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:49,994
which is to say it's as if you have a 
part of the brain that's evolved for 

114
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:54,464
that purpose.
It's the same place and everybody more 

115
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:57,284
or less their individual variations.
There are differences when people are 

116
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:02,300
lateralized differently,
but all that aside,

117
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,283
if you learn to read,
there's a part of your brain that 

118
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:05,474
specializes for that and it's pretty 
much the same place in every way and it 

119
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:13,151
wasn't there or wasn't doing that sort 
of activity 2000 years ago.

120
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,870
In fact,
I read at one point,

121
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:15,704
I don't know where the reference to this
is like so many things that I make 

122
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:20,054
reference to,
but I've had at one point that people 

123
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:24,050
thought Julius Caesar was a magician in 
part.

124
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:25,640
I mean he was obviously a remarkable 
person,

125
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,710
but in part because he can read 
silently,

126
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,130
he didn't have to read a loud,
so it wasn't just reading.

127
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:31,964
That was remarkable.
It was being able to read without 

128
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:34,580
talking.
Anyways,

129
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:39,230
the point of all of this is that
your brain,

130
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:40,064
this is [inaudible] view of the brain 
fundamentally is your brain is an organ 

131
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:45,690
that produces sub organs,
culturally specific subordinates,

132
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,573
not it's that's it's remarkable capacity
is that it can generate new molecules 

133
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,743
that are specialized for certain tasks 
as a consequence of environmental 

134
00:08:56,941 --> 00:09:00,360
programming.
This is an interesting sort of notion,

135
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,270
which is to say that at some level of 
physiological there analysis,

136
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,720
at least your culture determines how 
your brain works.

137
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,340
Now it's very classic.
You know,

138
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:09,960
your brain is very plastic.
When you were a child.

139
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,823
You can sustain immense amount of 
cortical damage in childhood and still 

140
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:16,020
grow up normally.
For example,

141
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,080
if you're a very,
very epileptic as a child,

142
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,980
sometimes what surgeons will do is take 
out a whole hemisphere,

143
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,083
the whole right hemisphere gone.
And children who have hemisphere 

144
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,230
activities,
if they're done young enough,

145
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:31,710
still grow up to be relatively normal,
quite normal.

146
00:09:31,711 --> 00:09:32,544
In fact.
And there are other cases too where 

147
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,433
people are hydrocephalic,
which basically means that they're 

148
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:39,990
ventricles don't vamped properly.
Um,

149
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,940
and cerebral spinal fluid builds up in 
the sculpt.

150
00:09:42,941 --> 00:09:45,840
So these people often have stalls that 
are slightly larger than normal,

151
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,140
not necessarily obvious,
but what steel case.

152
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,093
And they end up with a skull.
It's essentially full of liquid with a 

153
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:54,114
very,
very thin layer of brain tissue around 

154
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,320
this,
this all of liquid.

155
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,280
And,
uh,

156
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,113
there are a number of case reports of 
people who have like 5% of the aquatic 

157
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:06,930
and tissue intact who have high 
functioning intelligence,

158
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:08,910
his normal personality.
So the point is,

159
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:11,220
you're,
especially the higher cortical levels of

160
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:14,610
your writing are very,
very functionally flexible.

161
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:16,890
We can childhood now by the time you're 
an adult,

162
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:18,610
you know,
the pattern changes a little bit done,

163
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,070
kind of looks like your brain dies into 
it's adult configuration.

164
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,953
That's an interesting we look at,
which is to say you have way more 

165
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:27,840
neurons that you need,
especially right before you're born.

166
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,910
And a environment prunes your brain down
to its adult configuration.

167
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,200
So although of course you develop 
connections as well,

168
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:38,760
but you lose a lot of neurons.
So,

169
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,550
uh,
and by the time you're an adult,

170
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,110
you're brain is nowhere near as flexible
as it was when you were a child.

171
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,953
And if you sustain damage to certain 
parts of your brain that are already 

172
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:50,070
specialized,
well and you know,

173
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:52,350
then you have the damage and you can 
work around all that,

174
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,760
but it can still be really prominent
question.

175
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,440
So that's sort of the market and it's,
yeah,

176
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,333
that's right.
That's the department because it is the 

177
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,330
rent adapts,
whereas the body,

178
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,770
yeah,
that's a great comment.

179
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:06,210
You know,
and if you start thinking about that,

180
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:08,490
it has really revolutionary implication.
So you can say,

181
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,473
for example,
if I have an idea that's really radical 

182
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,210
and saying in a sense that changes the 
configuration of my Cortex,

183
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,440
I can transmit that maybe not to you.
Maybe your brain is already fixed,

184
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:20,274
so to speak,
put down the generations and alter the 

185
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:23,340
structure of brains,
hand spores.

186
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:24,174
So you could say,
well,

187
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,150
ideas can spread through a population 
that way.

188
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,800
That's a lamarche and sprint.

189
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,430
But even more interestingly,
I think this is speculative of course,

190
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:33,264
but let's say that Tom,
there are certain types of revolutions 

191
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:40,590
in thought that are actually the 
consequences of biological mutations.

192
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,910
So you could see that,
well,

193
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:42,803
you're a particularly odd sort of person
from the genetic perspective and as a 

194
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,300
consequence you think in a very,
very unique manner.

195
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,463
But the thing that's so interesting is 
that if you can still communicate those 

196
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:55,510
thoughts,
then the effect of that genetic mutation

197
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:56,344
can be transmitted throughout the 
population without any biological 

198
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:01,130
alteration at the genetic level at all.
So that's,

199
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,013
that's really something,
something that's interesting because it 

200
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:04,894
means that the consequences of genetic 
mutations on combination can spread 

201
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,410
through a population as fast as 
communication can move.

202
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,390
So that's,
yeah,

203
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:14,224
the Lamarckian does it,
everybody know what Lamar can 

204
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,140
transmission is?
Well,

205
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,340
Lamarck was the character who thought 
that the reason that that you could,

206
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,370
you could transmit acquired 
characteristics.

207
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,203
So the reason drafts that long the x is 
because it kept trying to stretch their 

208
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:29,640
net is basically,
uh,

209
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,633
so,
and they transmitted the capacity to do 

210
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:33,484
the stretching to their offspring.
So you can transmit acquired 

211
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,250
characteristics down the genetic line 
and there's no,

212
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,720
you can't do that,
that's wrong.

213
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:41,554
But that's what Lamar thought.
But he wasn't completely wrong because 

214
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,374
there is,
that is how this sort of transmission 

215
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:49,360
works.
It's non genetically mediated cumulation

216
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:52,930
of biological resources.
So that's very interesting.

217
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,590
So,
you know,

218
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,180
that's a good comment.
Okay.

219
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,610
Anyways,
so,

220
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,560
uh,
that's kind of,

221
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,300
that's,
that's some of the background of why I'm

222
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:04,810
interested in,
in the neuropsychology of culture.

223
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,460
And if you're interested in that sort of
thing,

224
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,500
you want to read the golf ski and you 
want to read Luria.

225
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,543
Um,
because the Russians are really 

226
00:13:10,571 --> 00:13:11,404
interested in the effect of culture on 
cognition and the regulation of emotion 

227
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,893
on as far as I'm concerned,
like for a long time they were five 

228
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:19,294
decades of hand of North American Europe
in terms of exploring this sort of 

229
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:22,654
thing.

230
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,830
I'm not exactly sure why that is,
but that is the case.

231
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,860
So,
okay.

232
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,940
Well the first thing that I started to 
started to realize I guess,

233
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,330
and this,
this is sort of an emergent realization.

234
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,583
It wasn't something that happened early 
on when I was trying to develop these 

235
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:43,920
ideas.
It became a way of making them clearer.

236
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,273
I started giving some consideration,
I guess to the old philosophical 

237
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:53,401
distinction between facts and values,
no

238
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,630
values,
and you could say value.

239
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:03,670
That's kind of it in the domain of what 
should be and uh,

240
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,063
or ethics and a fat.
Well that's kind of in the domain of 

241
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:14,920
what actually is or what,
or what was more,

242
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,030
what could be,
you know,

243
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:20,770
taking the past,
present and future consideration as long

244
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:24,310
be known in philosophical circles that 
you can make any,

245
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,130
you can't draw any conclusions about 
what should be,

246
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,880
what ought to be from an analysis of 
what is,

247
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,130
which is to say you can't derive an 
ought from an nice,

248
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,840
and there's some sort of divide there 
and you can sort of think of have this.

249
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,033
Um,
just knowing the particulars of the 

250
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:43,150
situation doesn't mean that you know how
to act there.

251
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,970
And I think that's really where the 
division takes place,

252
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:46,804
which is to say that come out with a 
description of the characteristics of a 

253
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:50,194
place.
Like let's say you were from a lower 

254
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:55,790
working class family and you buy some 
Miss Fortune.

255
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:56,624
You have to go to La,
a Tuxedo ball where there'll be nothing 

256
00:15:01,971 --> 00:15:04,490
but rich people.
You don't really know how to act.

257
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,090
You know,
you can describe the circumstances,

258
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:11,270
you basically know what it is that 
you're going to encounter.

259
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:12,104
But that doesn't tell you anything at 
all about how it is that you should 

260
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,793
conduct yourself.
And the other thing that's kind of 

261
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:19,700
interesting about that is that how you 
should conduct yourself.

262
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,340
And this ties in directly to what we're 
going to talk about today's game.

263
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,120
You want to or what goal you want to 
pursue.

264
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,030
You know,
so you have to decide that a priority.

265
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:30,440
If you're going to go to this party,
you can say,

266
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:32,480
well I don't like people like that 
anyways.

267
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:36,670
They're all capitalists exploiters and 
they deserve my contempt.

268
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:39,530
And so I'll go there and act miserably 
and make everyone just like,

269
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,660
and that would be perfectly fine.
And that's an,

270
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,420
that's an odd as far as you're 
concerned,

271
00:15:43,421 --> 00:15:46,800
that's some moral injunction and if you 
accept that line of reasoning,

272
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,663
you're going to act one way.
And if your other line of reasoning as 

273
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:50,174
well,
maybe I have something to learn in this 

274
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:52,490
situation,
I'll just shut up and watch.

275
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:53,563
Then what towards the tubes,
the Ot under those circumstances to 

276
00:15:55,681 --> 00:15:58,550
something completely different.
So you know you can switch around.

277
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:03,100
What the should be is by determining 
where it is that you want to go.

278
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,300
That's obviously not something you could
do with Fox,

279
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:08,520
like whether you want to be liked or 
whether you want to be hostile.

280
00:16:08,521 --> 00:16:13,521
It's nothing to do with like be the 
objective aspects of the situation.

281
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,650
So yeah,
there's a real,

282
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,300
so that's a,
that's a problem.

283
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,110
So
that's sort of the background.

284
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:22,250
So let's go into this.

285
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,573
No,

286
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,930
we all know that people have belief 
systems,

287
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,370
but we don't really know as far as I can
tell what that means.

288
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,400
It's like
Kevin belief system.

289
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,160
This analysis sort of suggest that there
isn't such thing is there,

290
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,320
there's no such thing as they belief 
system is at the very minimum,

291
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:50,150
my belief system is composed of two 
elements,

292
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,993
which is your description of how the 
world is from the factual perspective 

293
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:56,870
and also your description of how the 
world should be.

294
00:16:56,871 --> 00:17:00,740
Or You could say your interpretation of 
the reality of phenomena.

295
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,693
It also your interpretation of how you 
should act with regards to those 

296
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:05,990
phenomena.
So at the very least when you're talking

297
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:06,824
about beliefs,
you're talking about something that has 

298
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:12,581
to constituent elements
always be known for a long time.

299
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,873
Now it strikes me that there's a real,
there's an analogous division in human 

300
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:21,960
cognition between fact and value that 
you wait,

301
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,220
describe that as the division between 
science.

302
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,783
Math.

303
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,113
Okay.

304
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,813
We don't really fight with people over 
what things are from the scientific 

305
00:17:39,911 --> 00:17:43,810
perspective.
I think in part because

306
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,613
unless you're,
I emotionally identified with your 

307
00:17:48,361 --> 00:17:51,150
particular,
which basically means unless you're,

308
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:56,190
you imbued your theory with dreams of 
career for example,

309
00:17:56,191 --> 00:18:00,150
or dreams of prestige or whatever,
why don't you scientific theories pretty

310
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:03,270
much as good as the next,
which is to say that from the scientific

311
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:04,920
perspective,
all facts are equivalent.

312
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,890
They don't have any intrinsic emotional 
significance.

313
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:08,724
You're supposed to be objective with 
regards to your description of the 

314
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:13,110
world.
We don't really have to fight about what

315
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:14,970
the world is.
From a scientific perspective.

316
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,110
It's partly because there's not so much 
emotion involved in it.

317
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,810
All that happens sometimes that's more 
of a contamination.

318
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,970
Then something central to the scientific
enterprise.

319
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:25,170
People are always trying to get rid of 
that.

320
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,183
You don't mess around with your data to 
make it turn out the way you want it to 

321
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:29,484
because the way you want things to turn 
out has nothing to do with the 

322
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:34,200
scientific enterprise,
at least in part.

323
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,413
The other thing is from the scientific 
perspective is we have a method of 

324
00:18:39,391 --> 00:18:41,370
solving arguments in the scientific 
world.

325
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,620
Sorry,
you can put whatever you're competing.

326
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:44,454
Hypotheses are about the nature of 
things to a task and in a sense if you 

327
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:49,074
can't do that,
what you're talking about is probably 

328
00:18:49,951 --> 00:18:54,390
not scientific at all or that's what 
funding at the very least.

329
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,330
So first of all,
there's not a lot of emotion and tangled

330
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,650
into scientific viewpoint.
You,

331
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,120
second of all,
if there is a problem,

332
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:01,560
a dispute,
we have a very,

333
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:02,394
very formalized mechanism for working it
out and people are usually willing to 

334
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:08,160
abide by that because well,
it works.

335
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:08,994
It's,
it's demonstrated its utility from the 

336
00:19:10,831 --> 00:19:13,350
pragmatic perspective.
Plus it's comprehensible.

337
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:14,610
You can outline all the rules.
I mean,

338
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,390
we really have a strategy for that.
You don't even have to be very bright to

339
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,233
scientists.
All you have to do is be very thorough 

340
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,910
and follow the rules.
This is a making explicit,

341
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:27,700
the scientific procedure that happened 
about 500 years ago there boats,

342
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,123
we know how to,
we know how to come up with a 

343
00:19:31,441 --> 00:19:32,274
description of the world from the 
sensory perspective that everyone can 

344
00:19:35,491 --> 00:19:36,220
agree with them.

345
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,310
We're less okay.

346
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,160
That isn't what we fight with people.

347
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,493
Yeah.

348
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:49,380
What's important to us is not what 
things are so much as what they mean and

349
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:53,320
so then the question is,
well in a sense what does meaning me?

350
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,423
And that's much the same as asking what 
is an emotion or what is a motivational 

351
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:01,900
state or what does it drive state.
These things of what we have proved very

352
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:02,734
difficult to nail down in the past.
What's the meaning of meaning but well 

353
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:08,890
aren't going to give you a provisional 
definition.

354
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:12,340
And that is the meeting of something has
its implication for behavior.

355
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,283
And I mean that literally and behavior 
is the act of propelling your body 

356
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:18,454
through space.
That's at least one dimension of 

357
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,184
meeting.

358
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,790
There are more profound levels of 
meaning.

359
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,060
You could also say that something is 
meaningful.

360
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:35,450
If it has implications for the Schema 
that you use to generate behaviors,

361
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,580
that's a more profound piece of 
information.

362
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:39,414
Something that's more profoundly 
meaningful cause then a phenomenon and 

363
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,450
event that occurs can change your 
reaction to hold classes of the fans.

364
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,463
That's a really been phenomenal,
but we are not going to discuss that so 

365
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:49,894
much today.
We'll just stick with the simple 

366
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,430
definition meeting,
which is implication for behavior and,

367
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,320
well,
I'll give an example in the chapter that

368
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:03,550
you were to read today about a girl
little girl,

369
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:07,330
three years old or whatever she is 
exploring her environment.

370
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,320
We tend to think that when someone's 
exploring their environment,

371
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:12,154
what they're trying to do is map the 
sensory properties of that which 

372
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:18,340
surrounds them and that's how we think.
So the girl in the example I use,

373
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,413
well what she's wandering around 
touching things and poking about using 

374
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,720
all the exploratory tools that she 
hasn't heard disposal,

375
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:29,030
some of which she thinks up and some of 
what she coffees and she approaches a an

376
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:34,070
antique table and on top of the table 
and there was a very fragile green glass

377
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:35,704
antique vase and she reaches up to touch
it in the course of her exploratory 

378
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:41,740
activity and your mother immediately 
shrieked no,

379
00:21:41,741 --> 00:21:42,580
don't touch that.

380
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,413
Comes over and grabs her hand,
pulls it back six zero nine and it says 

381
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,860
that's not something for you to touch.
Why don't you see

382
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,673
the girl has just discovered something 
about what that thing is from the 

383
00:21:56,951 --> 00:21:59,170
motivational perspective,
which is to say,

384
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:03,220
well you can view that object is 
something that has sensory properties,

385
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:06,040
but you can also view it as something 
that has motivational significance.

386
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:06,874
Then the motivational significance in 
this case for that child is ambivalent 

387
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,250
because the thing is interesting,
it's green and it's shining.

388
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:13,084
The draws,
the explorer Tory candidates candidacy 

389
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:16,330
out of the,
that she wants to approach it,

390
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,820
but it's also something that's linked 
with punishment.

391
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,283
So that's an ambivalent phenomenon.
Much of what we do when we map our 

392
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:25,990
environments is map them for 
motivational significance.

393
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:26,824
No,
because we're so good at being 

394
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:28,414
scientists or we have become so good at 
being scientist for the last 500 years 

395
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:32,020
or so.

396
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,820
We tend to think that when we mapped the
environment,

397
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:36,190
what we're mapping it,
four is it sensory properties,

398
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,900
but as far as I can,
first of all,

399
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:41,020
you think about it,
animals are not scientists,

400
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,420
so whatever they're doing is not a can 
decide.

401
00:22:43,421 --> 00:22:44,254
It's accepted,
it's more primitive and it's more 

402
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:46,504
permanent form.
Whenever animals are doing is more like 

403
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:50,780
whenever it was that we were doing 
before we became sides.

404
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,640
So you could say,
well,

405
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,493
what was that we were doing whenever 
that was 150,000 years ago or 250,000 

406
00:22:56,351 --> 00:22:59,560
years ago,
we still managed to Mac the environments

407
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,960
because we can live in,
I mean obviously we're all still here,

408
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:02,794
so our relatives were pretty good at our
ancestors were pretty good at doing 

409
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:05,704
that.
We weren't doing it from the scientific 

410
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,440
perspective.
We are doing something else.

411
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,443
What we were doing is mapping the 
environment for implications for 

412
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:12,994
behavior.

413
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:17,620
You see it when you really want to think
about this good and heart because if you

414
00:23:17,621 --> 00:23:18,490
think about it,
it's,

415
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,353
it'll start changing the way you view 
the world because it answers some 

416
00:23:22,811 --> 00:23:25,060
strange questions that are otherwise 
difficult answers.

417
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:29,370
Like
why do you stop asking questions about,

418
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,533
you know,
from the scientific perspective that 

419
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,170
you're surrounded by a certified of 
mysteries.

420
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,180
There's nothing you comprehend.
Absolutely.

421
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:40,720
In your field of experience,
there's more questions about the factual

422
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:41,554
nature of things wherever you look,
but sometimes you ask questions and 

423
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:48,961
sometimes you don't know what is it that
stops us in any given circumstance.

424
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:50,923
You can't answer that.
If you start thinking about how it is 

425
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:53,174
that people think scientifically,
you can only answer it if you start 

426
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:56,354
thinking about how does that people 
think from the motivational perspective 

427
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:02,480
because I can tell you that you'll stop 
asking questions.

428
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,030
Say about like I don't know any of you 
very well,

429
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,403
at least at the moment.
The fact that I don't know what you're 

430
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:12,830
very well isn't compelling me to do a 
tremendous amount of exploration because

431
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,783
I know you well enough so that I can 
predict your behavior in this 

432
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:16,664
circumstance,
which is to say that I have a very 

433
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:19,094
detailed vision in my mind of where this
next two hours is going to go in terms 

434
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:28,520
of the whole two hour period in every 
sort of sub temporal aspect of that down

435
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:29,354
to the immediate present.
And as long as none of you violate my 

436
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:32,834
preset positions,
I don't have to ask any questions about 

437
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:37,790
you cause I've taught you math and 
likewise for me,

438
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,040
as long as things go according to your 
predictions,

439
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,630
you know the world and the thing you're 
trying to predict is the,

440
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,250
the effect that your behavior has on 
phenomena.

441
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,400
In terms of motivation.
So anyways,

442
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,040
so you can just sort of keep that in 
mind.

443
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,190
So look,
as far as I'm concerned,

444
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:56,024
we think two different ways.
One way is being formalized and that's 

445
00:24:58,341 --> 00:25:01,270
the scientific way,
but the scientific enterprise is,

446
00:25:01,271 --> 00:25:02,104
is the attempt to come up with an 
accurate description of the sensory 

447
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:09,230
properties of phenomena in so far as 
those are collectively apprehensible.

448
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,303
But just to say that we want to know 
what things are from the sensory 

449
00:25:12,771 --> 00:25:13,604
perspective and we engage in a 
communicate an exercise to determine 

450
00:25:17,091 --> 00:25:17,924
that.
Because if I want to figure out what 

451
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:22,370
this is from the scientific perspective 
is much more effective.

452
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,283
If I could have a thousand people 
working on it all at once and we're all 

453
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:29,270
communicating our knowledge and we can 
build out a very detailed picture of the

454
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:30,104
thing.
But the only reason we want to do that 

455
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,263
so that we can track the motivational 
significance of things more accurate to 

456
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,403
say once again,
why does an animal care if something is 

457
00:25:39,011 --> 00:25:40,130
green rather than red?

458
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,743
Well,
it may be because being able to 

459
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:44,024
discriminate colors.
Finally we're finally means more 

460
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:49,790
accurate mapping of the motivational,
motivational relevance.

461
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,880
Just to say that if you can only see in 
black and white for example,

462
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,030
if something that's the same hue red is 
poisoning as something edible green,

463
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,160
well you've had it cause you can't 
distinguish them.

464
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:03,800
If you can want to see black and white 
know if you can see color,

465
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:06,320
which means you can make a finer level 
of sensory discrimination.

466
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,470
You can keep better track of where the 
good things are,

467
00:26:09,471 --> 00:26:11,930
where the bad things are and as far as 
I'm concerned,

468
00:26:11,931 --> 00:26:14,900
that's really why we do science.
In the final analysis when you get like,

469
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,823
cause you've got to ask what's the 
motivation for doing all these kinds of 

470
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:19,120
things and looking at the fruit flies,
et Cetera,

471
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:19,963
et cetera.
We want to keep track of where the 

472
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:22,424
motivational significance is up.
Things are and we can do that better by 

473
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:26,144
making finer and finer discriminations 
between things because then we could 

474
00:26:28,611 --> 00:26:29,444
say,
well this thing is that and this thing 

475
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:34,580
is that and it's useful to be able to do
that.

476
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,090
What I don't understand the difference 
between interest and value.

477
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,740
When a cat made me value the food days 
batty,

478
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,640
that is not necessarily interested it.
Um,

479
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:44,723
but still he places value on it.
So I don't understand the word how that 

480
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:47,634
works out.

481
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,430
Well things we are interested in,
things that have value.

482
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,730
So I don't think that I value having 
interests.

483
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,453
So is normally don't think about food is
that it's interesting if you're a food 

484
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:09,690
deprived and it's not if you're not.
So it depends on your,

485
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,330
it depends on your current state of 
interpretation.

486
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:16,630
So you can never identify anything is 
having interest as an,

487
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,513
an intrinsic aspect of that thing.
That's something we'll cover in more 

488
00:27:20,311 --> 00:27:23,070
detail too.
But if something is valuable to you,

489
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:23,904
your interest in the weather,
the valence is positive or negative so 

490
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,980
that interests can fluctuate.
I mean you,

491
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,720
and when you ask a question like that 
too,

492
00:27:30,721 --> 00:27:34,140
you want to make sure that you 
discriminated in your own mind.

493
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,780
The difference between the two terms 
that you're using.

494
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,020
So there's obviously some overlap 
between interest and value.

495
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,650
It strikes me that probably what you're 
referring to is that um,

496
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,173
the things that have no specify 
biological significance but that are 

497
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:50,130
unpredictable are interesting.

498
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,203
Something like food is valuable.
So you might be able to say that the 

499
00:27:53,991 --> 00:27:57,960
interest is the more general phenomena 
of value before it's being discriminated

500
00:27:57,961 --> 00:28:00,250
into its sub components.
Okay.

501
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,820
Cause if something unexpected happens,
it attracts your interest,

502
00:28:02,821 --> 00:28:03,654
which means that you value it but you 
have no determination of the value of 

503
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:07,004
yet.
You can only say here is something that 

504
00:28:08,341 --> 00:28:09,174
I didn't predict and then the purpose of
exploration is to is to put it into the 

505
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:15,030
appropriate boxes or something that you 
want to,

506
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,013
you want to give some consideration to 
cause that's like in a sense that's one 

507
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:18,894
of the most fundamental things that I 
want you to to to learn is that when we 

508
00:28:23,011 --> 00:28:23,844
classify things using exploration,
we're not attributing meaning to 

509
00:28:26,881 --> 00:28:27,714
something that has a neutral background.
We're taking something that has a very 

510
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:35,070
broad range of nonspecific meaning and 
restricting it to something specific.

511
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,650
So,
for example,

512
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,573
we'll make it more cooperative and take 
a wrap by the tail and you drop them 

513
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:43,800
into a new cage.
Interest is everywhere.

514
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,830
It's not one specific.
The racks going to sit there like this.

515
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:47,664
First of all it's going to be paralyzed 
because it doesn't move like it's motor 

516
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:51,480
systems are inhibited by its anxiety 
system.

517
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,030
It is not moving.
And the reason it's not moving,

518
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,660
well the rab doesn't know this but this 
is what we would presume the reason it's

519
00:28:57,661 --> 00:28:58,494
not moving is because
in novel territory there may be a 

520
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:04,920
Predator and if you don't move and 
predators can't see it,

521
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,933
so the route of sits there like this and
maybe it'll sniff a little bit cause 

522
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:08,970
that doesn't draw any attention to 
itself.

523
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,120
And if nothing happens that kills it 
slowly it starts to unwind a little bit.

524
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,190
And then it's the systems,
the bda curiosity,

525
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:18,024
which are the incentive reward systems 
technically start driving the route 

526
00:29:20,611 --> 00:29:21,444
around and the rattle explorer and what 
it's trying to do is reduce the 

527
00:29:24,091 --> 00:29:29,091
nonspecific value of the novel 
environment to something specified,

528
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:30,720
which,
which you could say in a sense.

529
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,970
Is there anything here that will hurt 
me?

530
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,420
So it's looking for punishment.
It's actually looking to avoid them.

531
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,830
But once they know where the hell they 
are,

532
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,230
is there anything here that will make me
anxious,

533
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,183
which is to say is there anything here 
that signifies that the punishment is 

534
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:46,990
likely?
Is there anything here that I can eat or

535
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:50,980
they will otherwise satisfy?
What am I consuming Tory requirements or

536
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:51,814
is there anything here that will signify
the presence of something that will 

537
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,760
satisfy by conservatory reprivatise 
those are four categories.

538
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,340
Punishment,
satisfaction,

539
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,310
right.
And hope basically.

540
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,433
And what the route is trying to do is to
restrict the indeterminate significance 

541
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:10,930
of the normal circumstance to a 
discriminant category.

542
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,033
Which is to say it wants to know exactly
where all the things that have 

543
00:30:15,401 --> 00:30:16,234
determined value are located.
Mostly it's going to map nothing cause 

544
00:30:19,991 --> 00:30:20,750
that's the alternative.

545
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:24,730
Calculates no relevance.
And most of the things around you,

546
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:26,700
our map into that box.
Like you'd think,

547
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,543
well your reactions in this room,
most of the phenomena in this room or 

548
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:32,330
not attracting your attention.
And I mean you can,

549
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,700
you can divert your attention to them.
But you like those things,

550
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,550
those are irrelevant.
You know how had I not pointed them out?

551
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,570
Perhaps you'd remember they were there 
and perhaps what they signify.

552
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,463
Nothing from the motivational 
perspective so you've mapped them is 

553
00:30:46,991 --> 00:30:49,840
irrelevant in most of the things you map
are mapped as irrelevant.

554
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,900
That is now they start with no started 
out as novel.

555
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,860
That's the fundamental,
that's the old position and

556
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,850
does the historical progression guess

557
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:43,060
say for the sake of argument,
the scientific method was establish more

558
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,820
last 500 years ago.
Say,

559
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:45,654
well it was at that point where are our 
mythological models of reality and our 

560
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,750
scientific split.
Now

561
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,953
I'm going to ask you to swallow a 
presupposition for the time being and 

562
00:31:58,021 --> 00:31:58,854
that presupposition is that town.
It'll take me a while to explain the 

563
00:32:01,891 --> 00:32:06,050
logic behind it.
Look,

564
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,450
you know how you get scientific 
information.

565
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,403
It's basically talk to you explicitly 
and you can read experiments and you 

566
00:32:13,711 --> 00:32:17,370
read theories and so on are the explicit
education,

567
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,670
but how you pick up knowledge of how to 
act well,

568
00:32:20,671 --> 00:32:23,100
that's not quite as explicit.
It's not as easy to figure out.

569
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,300
I mean,
obviously you model,

570
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,570
we know that children pick up a lot of 
inflammation by modeling behavior,

571
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,640
which is basic English is a big coffee 
adults,

572
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:32,250
and that basically means they watch 
adults act,

573
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,293
move their bodies who space and they 
duplicate those patterns of action any 

574
00:32:35,761 --> 00:32:36,594
generalized from,
so that's one way behavioral wisdom 

575
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,620
transmitting.

576
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,453
Some of it's explicit as well,
at least in terms of the receipt of 

577
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:43,604
rewards and punishments,
because parents will modulate their 

578
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:47,114
children's behavior by engaging in 
motivationally significant interactions 

579
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:51,044
with them.
At least that's what you should do if 

580
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:52,544
you're a parent.
That's your primary responsibility in a 

581
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:55,994
sense.
So that's what we mean when we say that 

582
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:58,963
you're paying attention to someone.
It basically means that you're 

583
00:33:00,381 --> 00:33:02,660
modulating their behavior with your 
behavior,

584
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:07,250
with your emotions.
So fuck a child will monitor,

585
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:11,870
our parent will monitor his child and 
react positively when something that the

586
00:33:11,871 --> 00:33:14,510
parent wants to happen happens and 
native glee.

587
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,630
When something happens that the parent 
doesn't want to happen.

588
00:33:16,631 --> 00:33:17,464
So the child's behaviors,
well that's just the classical 

589
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:20,414
reinforcement theory.
Basically you exchange rewards and 

590
00:33:22,431 --> 00:33:25,190
punishments and threats and promises and
more human behavior.

591
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:27,320
We do that all the time.
And your interpersonal interactions,

592
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:29,983
that's part of the reason why people 
with personality disorders can sort of 

593
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:36,220
have an uncanny effect on which is to 
say if your personality disorder,

594
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,800
do you have a really potent expectation 
about how someone else will behave?

595
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,410
Usually like a son of a bitch?
Fundamentally.

596
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,753
And if someone with a personality 
disorder encounter someone who doesn't 

597
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,083
back like that and they're a challenge 
to their belief system and even with 

598
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:51,860
personality disorders are extremely good
at turning.

599
00:33:51,861 --> 00:33:55,880
Everyone may meet into the same person 
that they already met and they do that I

600
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:59,360
think by exchanging very,
very subtle and covert reinforcements,

601
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:01,990
which is to say,
you're engaged with me.

602
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,893
I have a personality disorder.
Every time you act properly I'll ignore 

603
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:08,310
you or say something contemptuous or 
look away or do something quite saddled.

604
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,430
And every time you act like a miserable 
bastard,

605
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:13,700
which is what I expect all,
at least pay some attention and possibly

606
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:16,940
even reinforce you covertly.
And you'll find if you get close to me,

607
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,013
that you,
it's almost like you've been distorted 

608
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:19,934
by a gravitational field.
As your behavior starts getting pulled 

609
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:22,940
in strange directions.

610
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:27,450
We do that to each other all the time,
and one of the things you might consider

611
00:34:27,451 --> 00:34:31,580
it as well,
our societies are very large.

612
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,423
We're all engaged in these patterns of 
mutually modifying interactions and 

613
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,530
something emerges from that.
The stable,

614
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:42,950
and I guess I would say that the things 
I'm going to teach you about mythologies

615
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:47,030
are the things that I do as stable,
emergent properties from risk,

616
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:50,030
from centuries of reciprocal 
interaction.

617
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,223
So if we're engaged in some pursuit,
you're going to modify me and I'm going 

618
00:34:54,201 --> 00:34:55,034
to modify you,
and neither of us really know precisely 

619
00:34:57,381 --> 00:34:58,214
what that means because we're not 
conscious of all the reasons that we do 

620
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:02,660
everything and have to spend.
I mean,

621
00:35:02,661 --> 00:35:04,100
it's bad enough if there's only two of 
us,

622
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:04,934
but if there's like 50 of us,
well then you can imagine that 

623
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,023
calculating all the permutations of the 
interactions becomes virtually 

624
00:35:10,581 --> 00:35:11,414
impossible.

625
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,343
The point is we will settle into some 
sort of stable configuration or 

626
00:35:15,561 --> 00:35:16,394
important or will disappear.
Those are the options and a human 

627
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:21,434
societies do so settle into stable 
configurations and we don't really 

628
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:26,270
understand how that happens,
but we,

629
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,423
we have developed the ability to 
describe those configurations without 

630
00:35:31,461 --> 00:35:32,294
understanding and,
and I think that makes up a big part of 

631
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:34,544
mythology.
So miss are the stories we tell 

632
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:37,304
ourselves how we behave when we don't 
know how it is that we behave or even 

633
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:44,340
why.
So when a file that when you know things

634
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:46,110
to consider in the future,

635
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,900
let's go back.
Good.

636
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,300
Was there some connection between what 
you,

637
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,583
the distinction you were just making him
the declarative declarative memory that 

638
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,810
just talks about yeah,
absolutely.

639
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:12,770
Yeah.
We'll discuss.

640
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,140
We'll discuss that in some detail.
I think the is,

641
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,750
so you have these three separate memory 
systems.

642
00:36:17,751 --> 00:36:21,130
One of them's knowing non declarative,
which basically it's nonrepresentational

643
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,280
ducks,
the procedural system,

644
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,290
procedural memory governance,
your motor output.

645
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,390
If it's habitual under an employee.
That's right.

646
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,403
You use your procedural memory to walk 
with because walking is way too 

647
00:36:29,451 --> 00:36:32,150
complicated to do as a consequence of 
representation.

648
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:36,380
It's like it's such a complex.
While you can't think about how to walk.

649
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:37,580
It's a habit.
It's a skill.

650
00:36:37,581 --> 00:36:39,830
It's like if you play the piano,
if you know a piece off by heart,

651
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,173
as soon as you think about it while your
fingers stumble over themselves because 

652
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,310
it's too complicated to think about.

653
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,680
You can't handle all that information in
your interactive conscious.

654
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,693
Anyways.
We've coded a lot of behavioral 

655
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,420
information in our procedural systems.
It's not,

656
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,760
it's not declarative.
It's not representation.

657
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,560
It's there.
Well,

658
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,423
I think part of what a story is is it is
the representation of the patterns of 

659
00:37:02,451 --> 00:37:04,610
behavior that are coded in a procedural 
systems.

660
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,870
So you see when we're engaged in any 
sort of interaction,

661
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,713
you and I are both modifying the 
contents of our procedural memory 

662
00:37:11,391 --> 00:37:16,391
systems by exchanging to put it very 
harshly by exchanging reinforcements.

663
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,610
We do not understand the nature of the 
pattern.

664
00:37:19,611 --> 00:37:20,444
That's the outcome of that exchange.
But we can watch it and that's what the 

665
00:37:23,961 --> 00:37:25,480
story is.
It's our,

666
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,840
I think,
I think that's our,

667
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,703
our episodic memory system that kicks up
images basically cause we'll get it 

668
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,653
back.
Your right hemisphere is good at 

669
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:35,100
recognizing patterns,
you know,

670
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,290
and your behaviors.

671
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,430
Behaviors have patterns obviously.
That's why you can predict behaviors.

672
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,013
One of the ways that we make those 
patens explicit is by making images of 

673
00:37:45,201 --> 00:37:48,570
them and then describing,
and that's basically my story and we,

674
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,413
you get a story.
Basically what you're doing is you're 

675
00:37:50,781 --> 00:37:54,350
using words,
activate images of behaviors.

676
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,023
You're trying to,
you're trying to instill behavioral 

677
00:37:57,501 --> 00:38:00,890
patterns by doing that anyways.
You don't understand the story.

678
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,980
That's all BS.
There's lots of stories we tell our kids

679
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:08,680
that we have a little foggy snowstorms.
Fairy Tales would like that.

680
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,913
Very peculiar stories,
but the kids are interested in them and 

681
00:38:11,961 --> 00:38:13,830
they'll listen to them over and over and
over.

682
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,753
And that's because there's a lot of 
information in those stories like that 

683
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,250
or than you can possibly imagine all 
embedded in those stories.

684
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,300
And the person who's listening to it 
doesn't understand it and the person was

685
00:38:26,301 --> 00:38:27,134
telling it doesn't understand it,
but the inflammation is still 

686
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:30,494
transmitted.

687
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,270
So,
which is very peculiar.

688
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,090
It's very strange.
So I started thinking about that because

689
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,973
was very,
well when I started understanding that 

690
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:40,900
religious systems of thought actually 
had some meaning,

691
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:41,734
that they,
that the stories they were telling were 

692
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:44,530
accurate.
Then I couldn't figure out,

693
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,520
well,
if they are accurate,

694
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:48,430
how the hell did they develop?
If no one understands what they mean,

695
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:49,840
if which is impossible,
right?

696
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:50,674
It's like how do you develop a system of
thought in the absence of any 

697
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:55,840
understanding of what the system means?
Well,

698
00:38:55,841 --> 00:38:58,120
that seems like a complete with insulin 
and with our problem,

699
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,770
it's like,
well,

700
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:00,604
you,
it's,

701
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,573
you don't point about something similar 
with dream to set up a dream will 

702
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:08,530
sometimes give you a premonition of a 
future state and he didn't mean that you

703
00:39:08,531 --> 00:39:10,600
could interpret the future by reading 
your dreams.

704
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:14,210
He meant that the thing that you will 
become is in,

705
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,213
in a sense,
operative now it's in its nascent form 

706
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:23,350
and on that nascent form has more to do 
with dream structure and imagination.

707
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,940
And it does with anything explicit.
If you can interpret your dream,

708
00:39:25,941 --> 00:39:27,940
sometimes you can see where it is that 
you're headed.

709
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,590
And again,
it was the same mystery.

710
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:30,603
How is it that your brain can know where
you're going to be when you can't even 

711
00:39:32,591 --> 00:39:33,424
understand what that means?
But that's why there's multiple memory 

712
00:39:35,471 --> 00:39:36,304
systems.
Theory is really useful because you can 

713
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,374
say,
well,

714
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,330
look at social animals,
for example.

715
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:44,080
Like a wolf obviously does not have a 
declarative representation of the nature

716
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,610
of its social structure.
You know,

717
00:39:45,611 --> 00:39:48,910
it knows who's white on the dominance 
hierarchy and knows how to behave,

718
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,790
but it can't describe it's patterns of 
behavior.

719
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:55,660
They're not conscious,
meaning they're not representational,

720
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:56,494
they're not declared,
but they're still there and they're 

721
00:39:58,091 --> 00:40:01,060
there because they've been selected for,
from the Darwinian perspective.

722
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,163
It's like these patterns of interaction.
There's certain patterns of social 

723
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:04,840
interaction.

724
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,470
They're stable over time.
They emerge as a consequence of a social

725
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:09,304
interactions.
And they emerge way before the groups 

726
00:40:12,101 --> 00:40:12,934
that have the patterns,
understand what the patterns are and 

727
00:40:15,461 --> 00:40:16,294
are.
Our attempts to spin stories are 

728
00:40:18,191 --> 00:40:19,024
descriptions of those patterns of action
before we understand what they are 

729
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,460
giving.
Another example of that same,

730
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,063
uh,
people have said that everything in 

731
00:40:26,921 --> 00:40:30,630
Freud is in Shakespeare.
But the thing about about Shakespeare is

732
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,520
that nothing in Shakespeare's explicit,
it's still all story,

733
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,620
right?
He was great spinner of drama,

734
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:38,200
all Shakespeare's plays,
plays,

735
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:41,710
which was a reference to behavior.
All Shakespeare's plays are

736
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,343
images of patterns of action.
You can say what Freud did in so far as 

737
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:50,950
you grant,
he's theorizing Craig's is make an image

738
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:51,784
of a pattern of behavior,
explicit representation from the 

739
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,250
perspective of some manner from 
perspective of words.

740
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,300
Well,
same with maths.

741
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,020
I mean we miss her full of wisdom about 
behavior,

742
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,300
but it hasn't yet been made explicit.

743
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,413
And now the problem with us of course,
is that we think we know our hands are 

744
00:41:09,071 --> 00:41:09,904
full of a lot of bizarre nonsense and 
that makes it very difficult for us to 

745
00:41:12,341 --> 00:41:14,740
figure out what it me.
And that brings me back to this.

746
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:16,130
This is where I'm telling you this whole
story.

747
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:16,973
It's 500 years ago,
the scientific methodology was four 

748
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:23,770
formalized when we found out very 
rapidly.

749
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,143
Let me read you something from you.
He's talking about the typical attitude 

750
00:41:28,331 --> 00:41:29,164
that commit evil individuals.
So this is the Orthodox Christian media 

751
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:31,924
evil individual.
And you have to realize that hundred 

752
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,380
years ago,
the in Europe site,

753
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,373
although there might've been sectarian 
differences within the Christian 

754
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:41,280
community,
in most cases you are Christian.

755
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:44,840
Not because that's what you believe,
but because the world that you lived in,

756
00:41:44,841 --> 00:41:45,674
was it Christian world?
It wasn't like you had 15 different 

757
00:41:47,991 --> 00:41:48,824
belief systems,
all of which were equally coherent to 

758
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:51,650
sort of choose between.

759
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:55,070
It was that the world you inhabit,
it was Christian.

760
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,320
That was the explanation of the 
universe.

761
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,690
So anyways,
young said,

762
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,200
you know,
it isn't till culture start mixing.

763
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,420
For example,
you can't take like a Muslim if you're a

764
00:42:05,421 --> 00:42:06,770
Christian,
unless you've met one.

765
00:42:06,771 --> 00:42:09,410
And if they're not around,
well the issue doesn't even come up.

766
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:10,603
So anyways,
you can see how totally different than 

767
00:42:13,001 --> 00:42:14,930
the world appear to medieval man.
For him,

768
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:15,764
the Earth was eternally fixed and that 
rest in the center of the universe and 

769
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,070
circled by the course of a son.
That's statistically,

770
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,180
there's stone,
it's more men.

771
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:25,700
We're all children of God under the 
loving care of the most high,

772
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,710
who prepared them for an eternal 
blessedness,

773
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:28,823
and they all knew exactly what they 
should do and how they should conduct 

774
00:42:30,531 --> 00:42:33,260
themselves in order to rise from a 
corruptible world.

775
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:37,460
Do an incorruptible and joyous 
existence,

776
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:41,180
such a life no longer seems real to us.
Even in our dreams.

777
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,290
Natural sciences long ago torn this 
lovely veil to shreds.

778
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:49,150
Well,
at least you know at the,

779
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,443
from a fundamental perspective,
we know perfectly well that the earth 

780
00:42:52,381 --> 00:42:53,214
was not the center of the cosmos,
at least not in the way that it was 

781
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,590
procedure from the medieval perspective,
and it was very,

782
00:42:57,591 --> 00:43:01,460
very rapidly after the scientific 
methodology became formulated.

783
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,503
Scientists,
we're generating observations like mad 

784
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:05,983
that seemed to exist in direct conflict 
with the most fundamental statements of 

785
00:43:09,441 --> 00:43:11,220
religious systems.
That's fine.

786
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:12,283
For example,
the fact that the sun was at the center 

787
00:43:13,911 --> 00:43:17,180
of the will of the universe originally,
but I mean,

788
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:19,010
we don't even believe that anymore.
It's just some,

789
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,990
you know,
semio obscure star,

790
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:21,843
not all that particularly powerful,
often some backwater corner of one 

791
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:25,184
galaxy among hundreds of billions of 
galaxies in the universe that's so big 

792
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:29,780
that you can't even comprehend.

793
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:31,123
So I mean that's a different picture.
And of course the logical conclusion to 

794
00:43:34,551 --> 00:43:35,384
Joe,
the to say the so same sort of thing 

795
00:43:36,501 --> 00:43:37,334
happened to Galileo.
The heavens were supposed to be perfect 

796
00:43:38,901 --> 00:43:40,610
from the medieval perspective and we 
never plan.

797
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:41,444
It was supposed to,
supposed to have a perfectly circular 

798
00:43:44,211 --> 00:43:48,110
orbit even because of the circle was the
most perfect of figures and the moon was

799
00:43:48,111 --> 00:43:50,750
supposed to be something that was 
completely without blemish.

800
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:51,703
Since it was part of the heavenly order.
Galileo with his telescope showed that 

801
00:43:54,891 --> 00:43:55,724
there were mountains on the moon and 
praise that he attempted to demonstrate 

802
00:43:57,951 --> 00:43:58,784
this to.
We need to look through the telescope 

803
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:00,194
because for there,
for reasons that we're going to discuss 

804
00:44:02,451 --> 00:44:04,280
that this course continues.
But the point is,

805
00:44:04,281 --> 00:44:05,114
is that very rapidly after the 
formalization of the scientific 

806
00:44:07,671 --> 00:44:08,504
methodology,
our ability to regard mythic 

807
00:44:11,961 --> 00:44:14,990
descriptions of the world as valid was 
essentially destroyed.

808
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,830
Well,
I think this is,

809
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,990
I mean,
I would like you to think about this and

810
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:21,824
see if there's anything wrong with the 
explanation because it seems so simple 

811
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:24,443
that it's observed.
But I think we made a big mistake of 

812
00:44:26,451 --> 00:44:27,284
logic somewhere along way because we 
made the presupposition that what we 

813
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:31,124
were doing when we were doing science 
with the same thing that we were doing 

814
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:37,890
when we were doing religion,
which is to say that what religion was,

815
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:41,800
was an attempt to describe the world in 
the same terms or are,

816
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:42,420
are,
uh,

817
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,450
tending to the same phenomenon that we 
attend to when we're doing science.

818
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,700
So then we have the general attitude 
that,

819
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:50,820
well,
what religion was at bask was sort of a,

820
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,013
uh,
a science with an abysmally poor 

821
00:44:53,881 --> 00:44:55,890
methodology based on,
you know,

822
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,410
erratic and unpredictable and biased 
stuff.

823
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,240
Uh,
observations.

824
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:04,560
There were all designed to produce a 
given an all the religious people seem,

825
00:45:04,561 --> 00:45:05,394
you seem to have a sort of swollen that 
more or less whole as far as I can tell 

826
00:45:09,661 --> 00:45:10,494
too,
because

827
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,520
obviously these are generalizations and 
neurosurgeon exceptions,

828
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:15,354
but people still seem to believe that 
whatever it was that religious religion 

829
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:19,170
is doing is the same thing that science 
is doing.

830
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,003
It's just,
it's like a different viewpoint in the 

831
00:45:21,751 --> 00:45:22,584
same plane.
So you get these weird arguments say 

832
00:45:24,111 --> 00:45:27,300
between fundamentalist Christians and 
evolutionary biologists,

833
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,520
they're talking about different worlds 
and they don't know on either side,

834
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:34,463
you know,
so that

835
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,953
I want to tell you at least in part what
the nature of the world that the miss 

836
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:45,450
described is and how it differs from the
scientific world.

837
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:50,810
And the basic premise of this is that 
why medstar concerned about is the world

838
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:54,580
that you act the act.
That's what he's trying to describes.

839
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:56,160
So miffed tells you,
well,

840
00:45:56,161 --> 00:45:56,994
here's how human experience is 
structured with regards to how you 

841
00:46:01,621 --> 00:46:04,050
should act.
It's not that big a surprise.

842
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:04,943
And you know,
religion is concerned with morality and 

843
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,193
morality is the study of how the APP,
so it doesn't seem like such a major 

844
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:11,363
leap in some regards,
but it seems peculiar that people 

845
00:46:13,501 --> 00:46:14,334
couldn't have figured out
on a general like in a general sense 

846
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,163
that what religions were doing and what 
science we're doing where we're not 

847
00:46:21,301 --> 00:46:23,130
really convince her they weren't in the 
same domain.

848
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:25,830
Science is concerned with facts and 
religion.

849
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:30,120
Stories are concerned to value and you 
know a story has a moral right.

850
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:31,980
That's what you're supposed to derive 
from the story.

851
00:46:31,981 --> 00:46:34,140
You take primitive stories like aesop's 
fables,

852
00:46:34,141 --> 00:46:34,974
the is made explicit at the end here,
here's the characters and acting out 

853
00:46:37,471 --> 00:46:38,304
their roles and here's the behavioral 
information you're supposed to derive 

854
00:46:40,861 --> 00:46:43,320
from that.
Analyze the story for the moral.

855
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:46,620
The moral is in the light of the 
behavior which you just received.

856
00:46:46,621 --> 00:46:47,454
How it is that,
how is it that you should adjust your 

857
00:46:48,961 --> 00:46:49,794
ongoing behavior?
That's the kind of information that 

858
00:46:51,361 --> 00:46:52,194
stories have.
Stories provide you with information 

859
00:46:54,031 --> 00:46:54,864
about how to act,
which is the information about the 

860
00:46:56,371 --> 00:46:58,950
motivational significance of things and 
situations.

861
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,150
And when you have a story,
a good story about a given situation,

862
00:47:03,151 --> 00:47:03,984
you know how to ask and knowing how to 
act inhibits your anxiety because 

863
00:47:07,711 --> 00:47:09,540
knowing how to act means that we need to
do something.

864
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,373
You can predict outcome and as long as 
there are predictable outcomes all 

865
00:47:12,631 --> 00:47:14,280
around you,
then you know,

866
00:47:14,281 --> 00:47:15,114
anxious.
It's knowing how to act and inhibits 

867
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:19,120
your anxiety.
So I would say,

868
00:47:19,121 --> 00:47:19,954
well then it's not much of the 
presupposition that it's stories that 

869
00:47:23,401 --> 00:47:24,234
inhibits your anxiety.
The fact that none of us are made 

870
00:47:26,071 --> 00:47:26,904
anxious by any of the other people in 
this room is fundamentally because you 

871
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:32,170
share the same stories.
So we act in a predictable way.

872
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:38,720
So when you mess with someone's story,
you're messing up the structure they use

873
00:47:38,721 --> 00:47:41,800
to attribute determinant significance to
objects and situations.

874
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:46,570
And
you can mess with someone's story nearly

875
00:47:46,571 --> 00:47:50,110
by behaving in your own peculiarly,
culturally determined way.

876
00:47:50,111 --> 00:47:53,890
If you haven't to be among foreigners,
you don't have to say anything.

877
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:54,863
Oh,
the words sufficient are perhaps even 

878
00:47:56,771 --> 00:47:57,604
more potent than behaviors,
but just your mere existence poses a 

879
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:01,750
certain amount of threat.

880
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,710
Okay.
Anyways,

881
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:08,663
Nietzsche,
he observes something similar to what 

882
00:48:11,531 --> 00:48:13,330
I'm telling you.
About a hundred years ago we said,

883
00:48:13,331 --> 00:48:14,500
you know what,
I'm [inaudible],

884
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:17,330
if you think about it,
that we've worked,

885
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:18,373
we've like pouring the intellectual 
foundations out of Christianity using 

886
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:23,734
science,
but we all run around acting like 

887
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:28,930
Christians more or less.
This is his employment.

888
00:48:28,931 --> 00:48:30,610
He started about Europeans here a 
hundred years.

889
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:33,640
So this is peculiar.
No,

890
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,370
you might debate,
can think to yourself,

891
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:38,650
well,
I don't act like a Christian or whatever

892
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,900
it is that your particular religious 
background has to me.

893
00:48:40,901 --> 00:48:41,734
But of course that's really quite 
ridiculous because you did not advance 

894
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:45,460
all your behaviors.
In fact,

895
00:48:45,461 --> 00:48:46,990
you probably imagined almost none of 
them,

896
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,093
most of them are copied their coffee 
from your parents or from other people 

897
00:48:50,531 --> 00:48:51,570
that you matter,
you know,

898
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,400
from significant others throughout your 
whole life,

899
00:48:53,401 --> 00:48:54,300
from,
from books he read,

900
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:56,110
from movies you've watched and so on and
so forth.

901
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:57,303
In so far as you are inculturated,
your behaviors are not your only 

902
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:02,290
advantage.
And that's the whole purpose of college.

903
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:04,600
He had to invent every one of your 
behaviors.

904
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,430
Well,
you'd never get anywhere.

905
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,413
So you coffee behaviors that have been 
accumulated by humanity over large 

906
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:11,494
periods of time.
So whether you think you have a 

907
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,860
religious based morality,
you're not.

908
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,010
It's really knowing the issue because 
what you do,

909
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:20,463
okay.

910
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,070
Human human society as being religious 
for like

911
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:29,830
veering or nearing the hundred percent 
of its entire developmental history.

912
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:34,370
You don't shake that in 500 years.
I mean really

913
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,950
religions to boldly be explicitly 
tumbling down the cents

914
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,800
per hundred years with the rise of big 
ideological systems to replace.

915
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:51,880
All right?
As far as I'm concerned,

916
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:52,714
the system like communism or any 
authoritarian system mass just get 

917
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,980
replaced with religion.
Anyways,

918
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:02,710
Nisha said when one gives up Christian 
belief,

919
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:04,773
for example,
one thereby deprives oneself with the 

920
00:50:06,491 --> 00:50:07,324
right to Christian morality.
Christianity's the system consistently 

921
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:12,064
thought out and complete view of things.
If one breaks out of been a fundamental 

922
00:50:14,891 --> 00:50:17,350
idea like the belief in God,
for example,

923
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:19,840
on their by breaks the whole thing to 
pieces.

924
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:23,300
What is nothing of any consequence left 
in one's hands.

925
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:24,903
Christianity presupposes the man does 
not know and cannot know what is good 

926
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,770
for him,
what evil he believes in God.

927
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:32,870
God alone knows Christian morality is a 
command.

928
00:50:32,871 --> 00:50:37,040
It's the region is transcendental.
Beyond all criticism at all,

929
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:39,800
right to criticize or possess as truth 
or we have got is truth.

930
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:42,320
It stands or falls with the belief in 
God.

931
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,770
If modern westerners really do believe 
they know of their own accord,

932
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:50,800
intuitively what is good and evil
if they consequently take,

933
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:54,020
they no longer have need of Christianity
has a guarantee morality.

934
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,700
That is merely the consequence of the 
ascendancy of Christian evaluation

935
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:02,543
and an expression of the strength and 
depth of this ascendancy so that the 

936
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:05,894
origin of modern morality has been 
forgotten and the highly conditional 

937
00:51:08,601 --> 00:51:11,750
nature of its way to exist,
no longer felt on Nietzsche is basically

938
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:12,584
saying is that
the fact that you might think that you 

939
00:51:16,791 --> 00:51:17,624
can have a morality without a,
that we're talking about crystal 

940
00:51:19,761 --> 00:51:21,860
morality in this particular 
circumstance,

941
00:51:21,861 --> 00:51:25,340
but it can be any morality is derive 
from a system that was predicated on the

942
00:51:25,341 --> 00:51:27,290
notion that there was some 
transcendental Va.

943
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,053
The fact that you can think that you 
have a morality that will last without 

944
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:36,430
that belief is proof of how potent that 
belief system is actually means.

945
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,430
It has worked so well and protects you 
still so well

946
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,360
that you can be incarcerate Lee 
convinced of its lack of necessity.

947
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:49,023
Uh,
I noticed in your footnote on that and 

948
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,760
hear that you said you had originally 
said been English.

949
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:53,893
Yeah.
Um,

950
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,490
what's he,
I mean I know this,

951
00:51:55,491 --> 00:52:00,491
I know this applies for up to a 
character of belief systems in general,

952
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:01,514
but if he was referring to wasn't or,
or what's he to the sort of moral 

953
00:52:05,211 --> 00:52:07,640
realist philosophers.
Yeah.

954
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:11,570
To beat that English tradition,
which I think was about the same time.

955
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:13,610
Yeah.
He was irritated by attempts to,

956
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,713
to argue that we're already have a 
rational basis and it was in fact 

957
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:20,150
derived as a consequences of rational 
thought and you're going to see it.

958
00:52:20,151 --> 00:52:22,490
It's right there.
And then normally that normally that you

959
00:52:22,491 --> 00:52:23,324
can see it and that it's right there.
But that's how it was originally 

960
00:52:25,611 --> 00:52:26,444
derived,
which is to say that reasonable people 

961
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:28,994
got together and rationally decided that
this is how they should conduct their 

962
00:52:31,881 --> 00:52:32,810
affairs.
Oh,

963
00:52:32,811 --> 00:52:33,351
neat.
You said,

964
00:52:33,351 --> 00:52:35,150
look,
don't look at the historical record.

965
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:38,420
You behave first,
then you figure it out.

966
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:40,430
And there's huge gaps of,
of,

967
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:41,373
of tens of centuries between figuring 
out how to behave or between acting and 

968
00:52:45,561 --> 00:52:48,110
then later being able to say how it is 
that you have.

969
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:49,460
So,
uh,

970
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:52,730
he thought that the English,
we're putting the cart before the horse

971
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:59,600
in the man's man having no vision for 
the,

972
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,850
for the length of historical development

973
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,393
so I can not happens.
And then you make declarative 

974
00:53:04,731 --> 00:53:06,740
representations of it.
Then for instance,

975
00:53:06,741 --> 00:53:07,574
when a new person and you teach them,
declared what you teach them verbal 

976
00:53:10,761 --> 00:53:15,560
stories about the religion for example,
does that get into their behavior?

977
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:18,620
I need,
so that then by listening to the stories

978
00:53:18,621 --> 00:53:19,454
about that they actually learn the 
behavior of the procedural level of how 

979
00:53:22,071 --> 00:53:24,080
to ask and without believing.

980
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,170
Yeah.
Well that's a good question to me.

981
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:30,630
Um,
I don't know exactly what impact,

982
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,500
watching stories that has on behavior.
And I think,

983
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,753
I think really what watch the stories 
probably does too is reconfigure your 

984
00:53:39,331 --> 00:53:43,320
conceptions of the present and the 
future so that the motivation,

985
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:47,460
the significance of things shifts and 
that has a consequence on your behavior.

986
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:50,820
Although,
so you also have to realize that,

987
00:53:50,821 --> 00:53:51,654
you know,
movies and books and so on portray 

988
00:53:53,461 --> 00:53:57,360
heroes and heroes are more wireless for 
emulation.

989
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:00,780
And a model for emulation is essentially
someone to be annotated.

990
00:54:00,781 --> 00:54:01,614
So I don't think that you can write off 
the direct impact of the story on 

991
00:54:05,221 --> 00:54:07,020
behavior.
And when kids play,

992
00:54:07,021 --> 00:54:08,100
for example,
when they,

993
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,170
when they pretend that they're 
something,

994
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:14,040
what they're basically doing is 
embodying and imaginative representation

995
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:16,650
of a pattern of action.
And that's what that is,

996
00:54:16,651 --> 00:54:18,630
what their play does,
at least in part.

997
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:21,960
So there is,
there's some direct effect,

998
00:54:21,961 --> 00:54:26,961
I think
getting this neat,

999
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:32,041
you said,
look,

1000
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:35,170
you know,
we have no rational reason for having a,

1001
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:39,300
for continuing to behave in the way that
we behaved in the past,

1002
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:40,163
which is essentially a dog,
Judeo Christian presuppositions in 

1003
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,590
European society because we don't 
believe in the funds miracle.

1004
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,313
You don't believe in the fundamental 
premises of the system by which those 

1005
00:54:50,911 --> 00:54:52,680
moral rules we're generating.
So you can say,

1006
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:53,514
well,
Christianity Judeo Christianity is a 

1007
00:54:55,471 --> 00:55:00,471
tree,
a tree of recent positions.

1008
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,530
Then the most,
and we live out here in the branches and

1009
00:55:04,531 --> 00:55:07,560
the most fundamental presupposition is 
that there is a god.

1010
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,370
And if you,
if you break the tree at that point,

1011
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:14,530
then the whole tree is dead.
You just don't know it.

1012
00:55:14,531 --> 00:55:16,770
It might take a long time to die.
And she would say,

1013
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,450
and this was basically his theory,
for example,

1014
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:19,523
that's why people in the 20th century 
were so unbelievably susceptible to 

1015
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:24,503
rationally ideologies like fascism and 
communism rationally described 

1016
00:55:27,421 --> 00:55:31,110
ideologists because well,
well,

1017
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:32,663
because their foundation can be made 
very unstable by destruction at this 

1018
00:55:38,221 --> 00:55:41,060
point in their presumption hierarchy 
state.

1019
00:55:41,061 --> 00:55:41,894
Well,
this isn't an inhibitory network in a 

1020
00:55:43,501 --> 00:55:45,660
sense.
You can think of it as a methodology for

1021
00:55:45,661 --> 00:55:48,030
keeping anxiety under control.
When this goes well,

1022
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:52,830
that whole thing is cast into doubt.
The the grand inquisitor,

1023
00:55:55,510 --> 00:56:00,060
the trunk of the tree was not god,
but then it had been captured.

1024
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,320
The grand inquisitor is planning
foundation of the society.

1025
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:05,163
Had been captured by the RG,
religious and spiritual aspect that 

1026
00:56:12,121 --> 00:56:14,590
became be potentiated just undermine.
Yeah.

1027
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,390
Yeah.
Okay.

1028
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:16,350
That's fair enough.
Well,

1029
00:56:16,351 --> 00:56:17,880
that's something that we'll have to talk
about.

1030
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:19,163
Talk about.

1031
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:22,650
Yeah,
I don't,

1032
00:56:22,651 --> 00:56:24,010
I don't want to answer that right now.
I

1033
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,720
will just answer briefly.
You can say,

1034
00:56:25,721 --> 00:56:26,554
well,
the belief in God is the belief in two 

1035
00:56:27,371 --> 00:56:29,080
things.
One is authority,

1036
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:34,740
and the other is process of adaptation 
is simply and the priests,

1037
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,430
to the degree that the priest and 
Dostoevsky story encapsulate this,

1038
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:43,000
this was theoretically made unnecessary 
say,

1039
00:56:43,001 --> 00:56:45,280
well,
we'll tell you what the world is like.

1040
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:49,330
That's all you need.
But you remember Dostoevsky story to the

1041
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:50,163
Grand Inquisitor,
he met Christ out the back door because 

1042
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,830
that's why that's brilliant.
Story means standing,

1043
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:54,664
but does it as well,
even though the grand inquisitor is a 

1044
00:56:56,981 --> 00:56:58,240
fascist,
fundamentally,

1045
00:56:58,241 --> 00:56:59,380
it's representative,
I think,

1046
00:56:59,381 --> 00:57:00,214
in that story of the Catholic church,
tremendously potent authoritarian 

1047
00:57:02,951 --> 00:57:07,951
structure with sufficient flexibility to
allow them the active process,

1048
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,160
some small measure of freedom in which 
to operate.

1049
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:16,190
What'd you say?

1050
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:18,863
Well,
and it goes to ask you a story that the 

1051
00:57:19,741 --> 00:57:22,230
process is Christ in the grand 
inquisitor.

1052
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:24,090
He's the act of spiritual.

1053
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:28,763
Wow.

1054
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:30,183
Yeah.
He's the act of spiritual process as 

1055
00:57:31,461 --> 00:57:33,470
opposed to the static structure of the 
church,

1056
00:57:33,471 --> 00:57:35,770
which is basically once in government 
sense,

1057
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,060
it's trying to make things or disorders.

1058
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,980
Awesome.
Okay.

1059
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:43,603
So

1060
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:48,180
many ways.
As far as I'm concerned,

1061
00:57:48,181 --> 00:57:49,014
we have a split in the recognizance 
consciousness and the split is between 

1062
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,173
what we assume to be true from the 
scientific perspective and how we're 

1063
00:57:57,001 --> 00:57:57,834
willing to govern our actions because 
their actions are still governed by 

1064
00:57:59,821 --> 00:58:03,030
mythological presuppositions that we no 
longer presumed to be valid.

1065
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,090
We're still learning to accept them and 
we also know that they're useful.

1066
00:58:06,091 --> 00:58:08,090
I mean,
for example,

1067
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:12,240
Western democracy is predicated on the 
notion of the natural right,

1068
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,510
and the natural writers a transcendental
idea.

1069
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,410
Nobody's been able to pin the damn thing
down.

1070
00:58:16,411 --> 00:58:18,600
I mean,
what we found is we can't do without it.

1071
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:20,760
I know at the basis of natural,
right,

1072
00:58:20,761 --> 00:58:21,594
is the idea that you know,
there's something about you that's more 

1073
00:58:24,151 --> 00:58:27,380
or less incomprehensible that I have to 
have respect for.

1074
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,210
Although I can't categorize it,
I can't describe it rationally.

1075
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,980
If I act like it's not there,
things immediately go very badly astray.

1076
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,620
The notion of natural,
I mean people have tried to come up with

1077
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:40,080
rational explanations for the natural,
right?

1078
00:58:40,081 --> 00:58:44,370
But that's foolish.
That's foolish because like every system

1079
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,340
at the base of every system is a 
presupposition.

1080
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,510
That's because say well,
that's because you don't know everything

1081
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:53,410
and because you don't know everything 
that means,

1082
00:58:53,411 --> 00:58:56,520
but whatever you do has to be predicated
on some preset positions,

1083
00:58:56,521 --> 00:58:56,851
right?
I mean,

1084
00:58:56,851 --> 00:58:57,684
you have to take a leap of faith at some
point that the presupposition of the 

1085
00:59:00,901 --> 00:59:05,901
national right tree is that there's 
something valuable about the individual

1086
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:11,160
and it's once you accept that,
that's like a rule of the game,

1087
00:59:11,161 --> 00:59:13,890
we'll just play that game.
You're valuable and I'm valuable.

1088
00:59:13,891 --> 00:59:16,170
We don't want to why?
Given that premise,

1089
00:59:16,171 --> 00:59:18,060
there's a whole bunch of necessary 
conclusions.

1090
00:59:18,061 --> 00:59:21,590
Those are our main goal of the whole 
body of our natural rights.

1091
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,720
And you might say,
well,

1092
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,710
once you've accepted this,
you can rationally derive those,

1093
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,713
but you can't provide rational 
underpinnings for that because that's 

1094
00:59:32,241 --> 00:59:35,810
just in the sense it's in a sense it's 
just an arbitrary decision.

1095
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:39,050
It's just a game rule.
It's like you want to play the game.

1096
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:40,770
If you want to play this particular 
game,

1097
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,633
you have to accept that rule.
I don't think it's arbitrary now 

1098
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:44,123
actually.
I think there's a real reason why that 

1099
00:59:45,201 --> 00:59:47,480
particular phenomenon emerged.
Like it's fundamental.

1100
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,910
That's another thing I want to do in 
this course.

1101
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:52,580
Sorry I jump all over.
You know what that's like.

1102
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:59,600
I want to show you that this precept 
position is not arbitrary,

1103
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:00,943
that it's a necessary emergent property 
of successful patterns of social 

1104
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:06,090
interaction and then even if you wipe it
out,

1105
01:00:06,091 --> 01:00:06,924
he would pop back up.
I you say say that emphasis on 

1106
01:00:09,591 --> 01:00:12,770
individual work is the hallmark of any 
society bedside,

1107
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:16,970
properly functioning and stable,
stable in the long term and also capable

1108
01:00:16,971 --> 01:00:20,630
of updating itself when it's necessary 
and then it'll just pop up over and over

1109
01:00:20,631 --> 01:00:21,464
and over again of its own accord.
So that'll help us get away from the 

1110
01:00:25,701 --> 01:00:28,550
idea that morality is arbitrary in some 
sense.

1111
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:30,170
You know,
the old argument system,

1112
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:32,180
no matter what moral rule you can think 
of,

1113
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:33,043
there's some society somewhere on the 
planet who does exactly the opposite 

1114
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:36,464
thing
equal have used that sort of 

1115
01:00:38,841 --> 01:00:39,674
argumentation to too.
But that sort of evidence to argue that 

1116
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:43,124
there's no such thing as as 
transcendental morality that that's a 

1117
01:00:46,281 --> 01:00:47,270
useless pursuit.

1118
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:50,900
Nature's point was people say that,
you know,

1119
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:52,693
they're willing also to undermine their 
own belief systems by pointing out 

1120
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,890
obvious things.
Like you know,

1121
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,700
if you shoot a rocket far enough open 
space,

1122
01:00:58,701 --> 01:01:01,430
you open going to find having,
so God's not out there.

1123
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:05,960
We still act like our moral systems have
value in their useful and it really does

1124
01:01:05,961 --> 01:01:07,990
appear that acting that way.
It works.

1125
01:01:07,991 --> 01:01:09,670
So then you have to wonder,
well it works.

1126
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,320
You know what's at the basis of it.
And it's really interesting,

1127
01:01:12,321 --> 01:01:14,180
like when I first started thinking about
these ideas,

1128
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:15,263
there was still a lot of debate on the 
world scene in the sense of how it is 

1129
01:01:17,721 --> 01:01:19,250
that we should conduct two affairs.
You know,

1130
01:01:19,251 --> 01:01:22,790
at the very least,
there's two major sources of,

1131
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,410
or two major bodies of ideas that were 
in,

1132
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:31,070
in like deadlocked competition and one 
was authoritarian,

1133
01:01:31,071 --> 01:01:33,860
more or less the communists,
the communist bloc.

1134
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:34,773
They had the way of their head,
their notions of how to configure the 

1135
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:37,154
world.
And then there was our side and you 

1136
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:39,394
know,
we were basically at each other's 

1137
01:01:39,951 --> 01:01:40,784
throats and that,
that was very disturbing to me at the 

1138
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:46,460
time that have sort of all fallen apart 
now with any luck.

1139
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:47,603
And uh,
it does seem that whatever it is that 

1140
01:01:49,671 --> 01:01:50,504
we're doing in the West seems to work at
least better than anything else anybody 

1141
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:54,493
can come up with.
So Nietzsche was already in this 

1142
01:01:58,251 --> 01:02:01,020
morality has tried sitting there 
origins,

1143
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,940
you can't have it if you don't accept 
the transcendental origins,

1144
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:04,783
you might think you have it past that 
just proves that you don't understand 

1145
01:02:06,981 --> 01:02:07,814
it.
Uh,

1146
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:12,020
it's also the case that
this morality,

1147
01:02:12,021 --> 01:02:15,110
which has transcended dental origins 
works

1148
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,430
and it also seems to be the case that 
it's preset positions.

1149
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:35,103
Okay.

1150
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:46,340
I wanted to borrow some time for 
discussion.

1151
01:02:46,341 --> 01:02:47,180
So I just want to

1152
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:59,600
covered too
slow.

1153
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,880
Is Concerned with morality is how to act

1154
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,740
neat.
You pointed out a hundred years ago that

1155
01:03:22,741 --> 01:03:23,574
Tom,
the fact that there was morality was a 

1156
01:03:25,231 --> 01:03:27,690
much more difficult problem to solve 
then which,

1157
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:28,643
and he was right.
I guess in a sense the fact that there 

1158
01:03:34,351 --> 01:03:36,810
is morality is the question.
One of the questions that we're going to

1159
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,210
give us facts.
Why is there a morality?

1160
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:43,740
What does it mean that there is morality
and given that there is morality,

1161
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:47,350
is there anything that can be said about
if that's universal across morality?

1162
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,200
He's like,
see,

1163
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:49,063
that's another thing is we know that 
within a different moral systems there 

1164
01:03:51,901 --> 01:03:54,810
are differences of opinion about what 
should be done.

1165
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:55,793
I'm sorry,
across moral system there are 

1166
01:03:56,941 --> 01:03:58,580
differences of opinions,
if any,

1167
01:03:58,581 --> 01:04:02,070
about what should be done,
but the fact that there are moral system

1168
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:04,190
seems to be a universal of human 
culture.

1169
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,083
So there's something universal in the 
domain of morality at the level of 

1170
01:04:07,951 --> 01:04:11,970
analysis that says that every human 
culture has a morality on.

1171
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:12,803
I'm kind of interested in looking at the
metal structure of the morality is to 

1172
01:04:16,411 --> 01:04:17,244
see if there's anything that we could 
pull out that is common to the ball 

1173
01:04:19,201 --> 01:04:23,490
because that would give us some idea 
about what morality is and if we want to

1174
01:04:23,491 --> 01:04:24,324
come to agreement in the long term about
how it is that we should conduct our 

1175
01:04:26,881 --> 01:04:27,714
affairs.
And so in part lesson or propensity to 

1176
01:04:29,551 --> 01:04:32,520
engage the social conflict,
it seems to me to be reasonable,

1177
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:33,533
to be useful,
to be able to apprehend rationally what 

1178
01:04:36,091 --> 01:04:41,091
the basis for the fact of morality yet.
And so the methodology here is Bob,

1179
01:04:41,131 --> 01:04:43,740
we're going to look at some neuro 
psychology because I'm interested in,

1180
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:48,330
in what modern research has to say about
the way we regulate our emotions.

1181
01:04:48,331 --> 01:04:50,310
So that's one domain of evidence that 
we're going to cover.

1182
01:04:50,311 --> 01:04:53,820
The other domain is comparative 
mythologies strap.

1183
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:54,953
We're going to look at
mythologies from different cultures and 

1184
01:04:58,681 --> 01:04:59,514
see if we can extract from them what 
their essential structure is to see if 

1185
01:05:03,001 --> 01:05:04,980
there are any commonalities and that 
structure.

1186
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:09,480
So that's basically,
that was basically the notion.

1187
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:10,893
Say the basic issue here is how can the 
current state of experience be 

1188
01:05:15,481 --> 01:05:18,340
conceptualized in abstraction regards to
its meeting?

1189
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:19,780
It's just the same.
Well,

1190
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:20,800
that's what,
that's what,

1191
01:05:20,801 --> 01:05:21,634
knowing how to act meet.
What are the significance of the 

1192
01:05:25,331 --> 01:05:26,164
phenomena that you currently apprehend?
Say meaning means implication for 

1193
01:05:29,651 --> 01:05:31,810
behavioral output logically.
Therefore,

1194
01:05:31,811 --> 01:05:35,260
myth presents information relevant to 
the most fundamental moral problems,

1195
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,273
which is what should be done.
So that's the question that stories are 

1196
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:39,513
trying to answer how you should,
how is it that you should act but 

1197
01:05:43,391 --> 01:05:46,330
desirable future,
which is the object of what should be,

1198
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:47,980
can only be conceptualized,

1199
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:55,553
sorry

1200
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,630
can only be conceptualized in 
relationship to the present,

1201
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:10,780
which serves at least as a necessary 
point of contrast and comparison,

1202
01:06:10,781 --> 01:06:12,010
which is to say,
well,

1203
01:06:12,011 --> 01:06:14,560
if you think that things should be a 
particular way,

1204
01:06:14,561 --> 01:06:15,394
you're always conceiving that in 
relationship to the way that you 

1205
01:06:17,051 --> 01:06:19,690
conceive of them being now and those two
things.

1206
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:23,990
What's this kind of a peculiar aspect of
this form of cognition,

1207
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:24,893
isn't it?
You evaluate your presence state in 

1208
01:06:27,431 --> 01:06:28,264
terms of your ideal future,
but you also evaluate your ideal future 

1209
01:06:31,331 --> 01:06:32,164
in terms of your presence state.
So there's a constant interaction going 

1210
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:35,224
between the two.
That's why poverty for example is 

1211
01:06:38,711 --> 01:06:42,940
relative and I think it's relative in 
terms of its socioeconomic effects.

1212
01:06:42,941 --> 01:06:43,774
It's where you are in the dominance 
hierarchy to determines the effect of 

1213
01:06:46,091 --> 01:06:49,300
socioeconomic status rather than your 
absolute level of material.

1214
01:06:49,301 --> 01:06:50,134
Wellbeing is something that's what 
really worth considering for a 

1215
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:54,850
psychologist when they talk about ses 
because,

1216
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,313
well to give you one example,
like the black community in the u s 

1217
01:06:58,811 --> 01:07:03,811
which is a population that's frequently 
studied with regards to the consequences

1218
01:07:04,601 --> 01:07:05,434
of low socioeconomic status as a 
population group constitutes the 13th 

1219
01:07:09,851 --> 01:07:11,590
most wealthy nation on the planet.

1220
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,113
You can also sign,
so that's kind of interesting when 

1221
01:07:14,291 --> 01:07:16,180
you're thinking about things in absolute
terms.

1222
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,110
It's also the case that even the poorest
people in North American society,

1223
01:07:20,111 --> 01:07:20,944
you know with exception of people who've
fallen completely out of the world have 

1224
01:07:24,191 --> 01:07:28,410
access to two technologies.
The 200 years ago were non existence.

1225
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:29,253
And I'm not talking about computers,
I'm talking about like heat and running 

1226
01:07:31,091 --> 01:07:33,040
water.
So poverty,

1227
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:36,160
that's just one example.
Poverty is where are,

1228
01:07:36,161 --> 01:07:39,880
you are construe with respect to where 
you could be.

1229
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:42,910
And there's some,
obviously there's some level of absolute

1230
01:07:42,911 --> 01:07:43,744
poverty too.
I mean if you don't get enough to eat 

1231
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:45,843
well that brings everything to a halt.
But point is is that you can't conceive 

1232
01:07:48,971 --> 01:07:49,804
of where you are from the effect of 
perspective without also conceiving of 

1233
01:07:52,511 --> 01:07:54,530
where you could be in vice versa.
Uh,

1234
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:59,260
mass to answer the following stories.
What is,

1235
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,273
which is,
what is the nature of the current state 

1236
01:08:01,401 --> 01:08:03,670
of experience from the motivational 
perspective,

1237
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:08,530
what should be to what Angie,
we'd be moving and how can we get there?

1238
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:09,580
Well,
and I,

1239
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:11,410
I showed you last week is faith.

1240
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,950
Well that's a story as far as I can 
tell.

1241
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:24,420
Now you want to use your imagination for
a minute saying his dad snores.

1242
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,240
Just the story.
It's also a kingdom.

1243
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:28,683
What a ridiculous thing to say.
You could imagine that there's a castle 

1244
01:08:33,681 --> 01:08:37,940
wall around that and that what surrounds
it is hostile territory.

1245
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:40,760
So that can be viewed as sometimes in 
mythologies.

1246
01:08:40,761 --> 01:08:41,594
It's viewed as a notion might be one way
of looking at it might be viewed as 

1247
01:08:44,211 --> 01:08:45,044
barbarian lands are dark forces.
The point is is the out heres where 

1248
01:08:48,051 --> 01:08:48,884
things that you can't predict take place
and everybody who shares your story is 

1249
01:08:52,731 --> 01:08:54,470
predictable.
They live inside your kingdom,

1250
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:57,760
everybody outside is contaminated with 
chaos basically.

1251
01:08:57,761 --> 01:08:58,594
But you see why that is is even in this 
class is we have a vision of where the 

1252
01:09:01,641 --> 01:09:04,340
class is going to go both over the 
course of the whole semester.

1253
01:09:04,341 --> 01:09:05,360
And just today,
you know,

1254
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:08,900
we have a vision of how it's going to 
progress and how we can,

1255
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:09,793
how we can save ourselves in 
relationship to all the others in this 

1256
01:09:11,601 --> 01:09:14,660
class and exactly what's going to happen
and what the plan is.

1257
01:09:14,661 --> 01:09:15,494
And so as far as we're concerned,
we compose a unit and we're a unit 

1258
01:09:18,651 --> 01:09:19,484
because we can predict all each other's 
behaviors and we can predict each 

1259
01:09:21,531 --> 01:09:23,420
other's behaviors cause we all have the 
same story.

1260
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:25,640
That's what the story is.

1261
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:29,900
How does this tie in with mythology?
But one thing,

1262
01:09:29,901 --> 01:09:30,734
I haven't said anything about this.
Why do I think this all has anything to 

1263
01:09:33,531 --> 01:09:36,440
do with mythology?
It's kind of a glaring question.

1264
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:38,540
That's why you look at the Christian 
viewpoint.

1265
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:41,240
For example,
I say map it onto the structure.

1266
01:09:41,241 --> 01:09:42,074
Well,
Christianity gives you a picture of 

1267
01:09:43,161 --> 01:09:43,994
Matt.
That's what miss dew and Christianity 

1268
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,193
says,
well,

1269
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:53,830
what is man
contaminated by original sin?

1270
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:57,823
That's a hereditary retained.
You'd have it whether you deserve it or 

1271
01:10:01,131 --> 01:10:02,060
not.
It's they're

1272
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:09,860
in desperate need of redemption and 
living in a sea of

1273
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:13,430
chaos and misery.
Basically.

1274
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:17,870
I mean this is a pretty negative.
This is a pretty negative summary,

1275
01:10:17,871 --> 01:10:20,180
but it'll do for the,
for the present purposes,

1276
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:23,930
that's our presence state like,
and we don't want to trivialize this,

1277
01:10:23,931 --> 01:10:25,610
that the Christian perspective basically
is,

1278
01:10:25,611 --> 01:10:26,444
look,
there's something fundamentally screwed 

1279
01:10:27,771 --> 01:10:28,604
up with the world.

1280
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:31,220
Human beings do not fit here really 
well.

1281
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:32,060
We're,
we're,

1282
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:34,670
we pose a constant question to 
ourselves.

1283
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,950
We don't understand our place in the 
nature of things.

1284
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:39,050
We're always doing things that we don't 
understand.

1285
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:42,620
There's a central mystery here that we 
haven't solved.

1286
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:43,883
It's not,
this is not a trivial conception and 

1287
01:10:45,361 --> 01:10:46,194
people laugh about original sin.
What sort of weird consent concept of 

1288
01:10:49,981 --> 01:10:50,721
that,
but this says,

1289
01:10:50,721 --> 01:10:51,554
well,
there's something about human beings 

1290
01:10:52,191 --> 01:10:53,840
that we don't understand.
It makes them evil.

1291
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:54,913
Well
isn't just lack of socioeconomic goods 

1292
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:06,350
mass best.
Well then there's also some image of the

1293
01:11:06,351 --> 01:11:11,180
ideal future and that's paradise
or heaven

1294
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:13,793
or even the Kingdom of Heaven on earth.
It doesn't have to be something that's 

1295
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:19,560
purely spiritual,
spiritual.

1296
01:11:19,561 --> 01:11:20,394
That means in a sense
that means my domain of the imagination 

1297
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:25,620
and you could say,
well,

1298
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:28,920
paradise is the archetype of the ideal 
future,

1299
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:29,813
which is to say that whenever you're 
committing an action of any sort to act 

1300
01:11:33,481 --> 01:11:36,300
means to have a prayer,
which means to say that you are here and

1301
01:11:36,301 --> 01:11:37,134
you're going to go here and you have 
behavioral routines to bring that 

1302
01:11:39,781 --> 01:11:44,130
transformation about whatever act you 
undertake has that structure.

1303
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:44,993
So you could say,
well,

1304
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:45,953
the collection of acts as a whole has 
that structure to act is to adopt the 

1305
01:11:49,301 --> 01:11:50,610
structure.
You could say,

1306
01:11:50,611 --> 01:11:51,450
well,
you could

1307
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:57,240
abstract out from all of the particular 
notions of your ideal future.

1308
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:00,330
Some abstract that met a notion of the 
ideal.

1309
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:01,523
And that would be paradox.
So that's why you can see how these 

1310
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:09,150
myths sorts in fills the notion that 
there is some sort of ideal,

1311
01:12:09,151 --> 01:12:09,984
let something that's inherent to people 
and you can build your ideal well just 

1312
01:12:14,341 --> 01:12:17,520
by imagining what the best of all 
possible situations could be.

1313
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:19,920
And Christian morality,
by the way,

1314
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:21,023
is the acceptable procedures by which 
the unbearable present can be 

1315
01:12:25,561 --> 01:12:28,350
transformed into the ideal future.
And if you share that well,

1316
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:32,590
then you're part of a community.
And a community means that you're walled

1317
01:12:32,591 --> 01:12:33,424
in with all these other people who think
like you and all the barbarian hordes 

1318
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:38,250
and the discord and a male companion.

1319
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:41,460
The unpredictability that's outside.
Perfect.

1320
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:44,420
So that's a story.
And while that was,

1321
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:45,810
that was a religious story,
you say,

1322
01:12:45,811 --> 01:12:47,580
well,
the communist stories like that,

1323
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:52,230
I mean it's pretty outdated story.
Kindness in many ways.

1324
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:57,090
The current situation is characterized 
by a socioeconomic inequality.

1325
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:00,860
That's a consequence of class.
The class struggle that we,

1326
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,043
uh,
we can erect to heaven on earth by 

1327
01:13:03,781 --> 01:13:06,690
distributing income and opportunity 
equitably.

1328
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:09,450
We have to undergo a period of 
intermediate and chaos,

1329
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:11,190
which we'll get to later to bring that 
about,

1330
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:12,540
etc. Etc.
So,

1331
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:13,673
you know,
in one of the things that's happened to 

1332
01:13:14,191 --> 01:13:14,941
many,
many,

1333
01:13:14,941 --> 01:13:18,840
many European communities,
and this is an appalling thing,

1334
01:13:18,841 --> 01:13:21,650
is that when their religious structures 
collapsed,

1335
01:13:21,651 --> 01:13:22,484
the first thing they do is replace them 
with like far more idiotic political 

1336
01:13:25,981 --> 01:13:27,600
utopias.
And as far as,

1337
01:13:27,601 --> 01:13:29,700
I mean this has happened in many places,
happened in Russia.

1338
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:32,970
How in Germany,
I think it happened to China,

1339
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:36,870
I think it's happening pullback as a,
as a matter of fact as well.

1340
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:39,953
Anyways,
that's what I think when it came to 

1341
01:13:41,701 --> 01:13:43,680
quality last Roman Catholicism and you 
know,

1342
01:13:43,681 --> 01:13:44,514
the late fifties and now we think that 
if the political situation was just 

1343
01:13:47,341 --> 01:13:48,174
transformed,
that the world would turn into a 

1344
01:13:49,351 --> 01:13:50,184
utopian.
That's what happens when people lose 

1345
01:13:52,081 --> 01:13:54,180
their religious beliefs.
So that's the first thing.

1346
01:13:54,181 --> 01:13:56,640
They do use these cause there's a big 
hole there.

1347
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:59,100
But okay.
So that's the,

1348
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:01,770
that's the simple story.
And you can say,

1349
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:04,140
well there's more to the story in a 
sense.

1350
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:08,760
There's also transformational grammar 
and that kind of looks like this.

1351
01:14:08,810 --> 01:14:10,050
Say,
well,

1352
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:13,130
it's w go ahead.
I just wanted to ask you why,

1353
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:15,910
why you chose to call the president 
unbearable.

1354
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,073
I mean that seems to have such a 
striking implies a really strong effect 

1355
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,360
instead of letting it be imperfect or,
yeah,

1356
01:14:22,361 --> 01:14:23,200
well it's just,
uh,

1357
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,550
uh,
what do you say?

1358
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,410
It's kind of satirical I guess.

1359
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:27,243
I mean,
you're always trying to change it no 

1360
01:14:27,821 --> 01:14:28,930
matter what it is.
Look,

1361
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:30,070
I'll give you an example.
Okay.

1362
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:31,113
Really quickly.
I read this really funny story in the 

1363
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:36,460
Atlantic magazine needs a weaken.
I hated liking it because,

1364
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,010
but anyways,
I did like,

1365
01:14:39,011 --> 01:14:41,200
it was kind of funny.
But um,

1366
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:42,213
so this guy,
he's a travel writer and he goes on one 

1367
01:14:43,331 --> 01:14:48,070
of these cruises and everything's done 
for absolutely everything.

1368
01:14:48,071 --> 01:14:49,900
It's like if he goes and goes swimming 
in the morning,

1369
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:52,120
in the morning and he sits down on his 
beach chair,

1370
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:52,954
he gets a towel.
There's a guy there that's higher just 

1371
01:14:54,131 --> 01:14:56,980
to make sure he has a tell and if he 
gets up to walk around the pool,

1372
01:14:57,430 --> 01:15:00,700
the same guy's job is to go and get his 
talent and replace it with another one.

1373
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:01,563
I mean he doesn't have to do anything.
He said he could eat at the restaurant 

1374
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:08,650
18 times a day and if he didn't feel 
like walking up to the restaurant and he

1375
01:15:08,651 --> 01:15:09,484
could call room service and get whatever
you wanted and it would be there in 10 

1376
01:15:11,351 --> 01:15:12,184
minutes.

1377
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:14,560
As he said for the first three or four 
days,

1378
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:17,830
he was really guilty about this.
Like he couldn't stand the fact that,

1379
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:20,350
well it's often uh,
people from the third world,

1380
01:15:20,351 --> 01:15:21,970
often man.
And he ships by the way,

1381
01:15:21,971 --> 01:15:23,290
because they weren't cheap.
But anyways,

1382
01:15:23,291 --> 01:15:27,010
he was real guilty about having,
being waited on hand and foot basically.

1383
01:15:27,011 --> 01:15:29,380
And so for the first two or three days 
he was sort of racked by guilt.

1384
01:15:29,381 --> 01:15:31,570
But by the end he said,
and this is quick funny,

1385
01:15:31,571 --> 01:15:32,404
he said,
by the end of the trip having adjusted 

1386
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:35,913
to his new circumstances,
he was finding himself increasingly 

1387
01:15:39,221 --> 01:15:42,370
irritated by the fact that when he 
called for room service and they brought

1388
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:43,204
him a sandwich,
they always put it too close to the 

1389
01:15:44,651 --> 01:15:47,700
little decorative orange slice and the 
edge of the guts.

1390
01:15:47,701 --> 01:15:50,150
Soggy.
So anyways,

1391
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:50,993
sorry.
See,

1392
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:53,250
this is very funny.
You don't,

1393
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:54,560
that's when people are like,
cause you know,

1394
01:15:54,561 --> 01:15:55,394
he would just to sort of your,
your expectations of just to bounce the 

1395
01:15:58,151 --> 01:16:02,080
situation and then you construe the 
motivational significance of events with

1396
01:16:02,081 --> 01:16:04,660
regards to that that can 
conceptualization.

1397
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,090
Well,
so that's kind of why I put that as like

1398
01:16:07,091 --> 01:16:07,924
for him,
the unbearable president was the fact 

1399
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:09,490
that,
you know,

1400
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:13,410
of the corner of his sandwich was soggy.
He was ready Urinetown of himself for,

1401
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:15,340
for reacting in this manner.
But he said,

1402
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:17,630
well,
that's just what people are like when we

1403
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,473
are,
when you're set of expectations alters 

1404
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,710
the valence of phenomena instantly 
changes.

1405
01:16:23,711 --> 01:16:25,790
And that's why the Buddhists in part 
thing,

1406
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:27,100
the world is my ass,
right?

1407
01:16:27,101 --> 01:16:29,130
You just generate a story about what 
should happen.

1408
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:32,860
You can switch the valence of phenomena 
virtually,

1409
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,830
virtually at will,
but not entirely.

1410
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:37,960
I mean,
there's still certain constraints.

1411
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:38,794
So
you're always trying to run from this 

1412
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:44,980
incense to get to this.
It doesn't matter what your situation is

1413
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:46,173
and this is permanent.
Like that thing just moves more or less 

1414
01:16:48,161 --> 01:16:50,550
with you wherever you move.
So,

1415
01:16:50,551 --> 01:16:52,390
uh,
that's the simple story.

1416
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:56,720
And then there's the more complex story,
which we'll talk about it in detail.

1417
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:00,130
So when you have this,
that's the known,

1418
01:17:00,131 --> 01:17:01,390
you know,
that's an ideology,

1419
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:05,050
for example.
Well,

1420
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,390
if something interferes with 20 year 
plans,

1421
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:09,800
something unexpected happens,
you just switch to another plan.

1422
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:11,413
All right?
But I started again interferes with a 

1423
01:17:12,891 --> 01:17:15,290
more fundamental precept position like 
who you are,

1424
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:17,660
where you're going,
then this whole thing can come crumbling

1425
01:17:17,661 --> 01:17:19,610
down.
That's represented here.

1426
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:22,800
And this is transformation,
transformation,

1427
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:23,693
grammar in since I guess it's how 
conception a can turn it to conception 

1428
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:29,000
be,
which is to say that,

1429
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:30,143
oh,
people's belief systems will shift 

1430
01:17:31,461 --> 01:17:33,870
radically.
So you also need a structure for

1431
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:35,663
mmm,

1432
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:42,080
you have a belief system,
that's one thing and you need one.

1433
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:43,183
But you also need a process by which 
your belief system is outdated because 

1434
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:47,563
your belief system is supposed to map 
the environment and the environment 

1435
01:17:49,941 --> 01:17:50,774
keeps changing and now and then you have
to undergo a fundamental revolution in 

1436
01:17:54,771 --> 01:17:56,420
your beliefs.
And that's basically what this is.

1437
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,590
When you have a,
well,

1438
01:18:00,591 --> 01:18:03,110
you know the example I gave you will 
read about it in detail.

1439
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:04,820
It's like,
first of all,

1440
01:18:04,821 --> 01:18:06,020
there's a little story in that,
in this,

1441
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:09,410
in the book about this guy who was going
to a meeting and he's going to be a real

1442
01:18:09,411 --> 01:18:12,500
start.
This meeting is elevators late,

1443
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:13,393
so he thinks he's going to be right in 
the fact that the elevators late three 

1444
01:18:15,501 --> 01:18:16,334
of distressing because he's construing 
the significance of that with 

1445
01:18:18,471 --> 01:18:20,750
relationship to his meeting.
So that makes them mad.

1446
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:21,583
Nays down,
it goes up in front of the building and 

1447
01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:25,020
now he's kind of late to his meeting.
It's a few blocks away.

1448
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:28,580
Like anybody who gets in his way,
it makes a massive little old ladies are

1449
01:18:28,581 --> 01:18:29,414
lovers out for a stroll or whatever.
He construes their existence with 

1450
01:18:33,891 --> 01:18:34,724
regards to his plants.
So if you had lots of time while they 

1451
01:18:37,161 --> 01:18:39,110
wouldn't bother him at all,
but the fact that he's late makes them a

1452
01:18:39,111 --> 01:18:40,580
bowl of irritation.
So anyways,

1453
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:45,150
when the elevator doesn't show up,
yes to shift plan,

1454
01:18:45,190 --> 01:18:47,900
he goes down the stairs and said,
well that's a minor league irritation.

1455
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:49,273
Well say when he gets back,
he's done with his meeting and his boss 

1456
01:18:51,981 --> 01:18:55,730
calls me into the office and set aside,
you're fired,

1457
01:18:56,060 --> 01:18:56,893
you're incompetent,
you're the worst employee we've ever 

1458
01:18:58,611 --> 01:19:00,290
had.
Well,

1459
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:02,630
he had visions of being a star in his 
hand,

1460
01:19:02,631 --> 01:19:05,000
was evaluating everything with regards 
to that.

1461
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:07,580
It's still being quite irritated about 
the fact,

1462
01:19:07,581 --> 01:19:10,670
say the elevator wouldn't show up like 
now something's really make it happen to

1463
01:19:10,671 --> 01:19:13,370
them.
That's a major league discrepancy.

1464
01:19:13,371 --> 01:19:13,820
You know,
it's,

1465
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:15,860
it's blown out.
A few fundamental precept positions.

1466
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:19,580
It's knocked out his version of the,
of who he is and what he's doing,

1467
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,960
where he's going.
It's blown in.

1468
01:19:21,961 --> 01:19:22,794
The whole structure uses to interpret 
the motivational significance of 

1469
01:19:25,131 --> 01:19:29,210
phenomenon and that means that it's an 
event that's not be emotionally neutral,

1470
01:19:29,211 --> 01:19:30,120
has taken place.
It's a,

1471
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:32,840
it's an event that has a tremendous 
amount of emotional significance.

1472
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:34,910
He's very anxious,
he's very depressed.

1473
01:19:35,150 --> 01:19:35,983
It's like you could say in a sense,
and we'll try to outline this more 

1474
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:40,970
details because motivational systems are
no longer regulated.

1475
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:42,013
He doesn't know what anything means 
anymore and when you don't know what 

1476
01:19:43,911 --> 01:19:46,310
anything means,
everything makes you anxious.

1477
01:19:47,030 --> 01:19:47,863
That's a problem.

1478
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,450
Actually this represents,
so he's down here,

1479
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:52,430
everything's gone chaotic.
You said,

1480
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:56,510
I don't know who I am anymore,
and that happens to people you know.

1481
01:19:56,511 --> 01:19:59,570
Then you have to reevaluate your whole 
past and your present and your future,

1482
01:19:59,571 --> 01:20:00,404
your whole story shifts,
everything changes and maybe you can do 

1483
01:20:02,751 --> 01:20:03,584
that or maybe you cut your throat 
because that happens to people too and 

1484
01:20:05,621 --> 01:20:08,550
everything falls down.
It just can't handle it.

1485
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,720
They're overwhelmed by their negative 
emotions and that kills them.

1486
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,700
That's the end of the,
well,

1487
01:20:14,701 --> 01:20:18,030
let's say he pops back out of it.
He's a little bit more humbled as time.

1488
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,033
Figure it out.
Maybe he didn't like his God damn job 

1489
01:20:20,041 --> 01:20:21,690
anyways.
You should have done something he wanted

1490
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:22,524
to do a long time ago.
Maybe it wouldn't be in such a bastard 

1491
01:20:23,761 --> 01:20:24,594
and got fired in the first place.
His conceptions of who he is and why he 

1492
01:20:28,831 --> 01:20:33,090
wants to be have changed because my 
emotions are reregulated.

1493
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:35,670
He interprets the world from a slightly 
different perspective,

1494
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:38,550
but the metal structure of the 
perspective is still the safe.

1495
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:39,543
Right.
He was here in this kind of structure 

1496
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:42,413
when he was there.
He's still in this kind of structure 

1497
01:20:44,401 --> 01:20:45,234
here.
It's just what the contents of the 

1498
01:20:46,381 --> 01:20:48,810
structure and difficult,
so there's a stability,

1499
01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:50,563
there's a stability and structure as 
well as flexibility for change within 

1500
01:20:53,191 --> 01:20:54,024
the structure.
This is the big mythological story by 

1501
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:57,970
the way.
Set us up.

1502
01:20:58,410 --> 01:21:01,260
You can look at this all sorts of ways.
I'll try to diagram this out later.

1503
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,340
These are castles.
Kingdoms.

1504
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:07,890
Say this is a dominance hierarchy.
That's,

1505
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,290
and then we'll discuss that in some 
detail later.

1506
01:21:10,590 --> 01:21:12,750
It's like if you're in a corporation,
for example,

1507
01:21:12,751 --> 01:21:15,600
you share a dream with everybody in the 
corporation and you arrange yourself and

1508
01:21:15,601 --> 01:21:16,434
a power hierarchy to attain the goals of
the corporation to get from here to 

1509
01:21:19,951 --> 01:21:20,610
here.

1510
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:21,443
You move up the dominance hierarchy and 
it's in your best interest under those 

1511
01:21:23,731 --> 01:21:24,564
circumstances to keep the corporation 
going and also to prop yourself up the 

1512
01:21:27,211 --> 01:21:28,044
levels of the dominance hierarchy.
So there's a dominance hierarchy here 

1513
01:21:30,571 --> 01:21:34,340
and the king of the dominance hierarchy.
Maybe it's the CEO or whatever,

1514
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:35,203
Hayes.
He's the active representative of the 

1515
01:21:36,871 --> 01:21:37,704
ideal future,
which makes him the king basically from 

1516
01:21:39,781 --> 01:21:42,030
the mythological perspective.
Anyways,

1517
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,060
so that's a community.
This is a dragon.

1518
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:47,143
That's one way of looking at a dragon is
something that there's in a cave and 

1519
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:52,200
it's very dangerous,
but it sits on something very promising.

1520
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:53,760
Cord of treasure.

1521
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,353
Dragons are the places that an almost 
events emerged from say their 

1522
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:04,140
representations of the chaos that 
surrounds predictable territory.

1523
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:05,303
The thing about chaos is that it's 
threatening and policies at the same 

1524
01:22:07,651 --> 01:22:12,651
time.
Yeah,

1525
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:16,963
and it seems that the majority of our 
behavior is not able to be planned or 

1526
01:22:21,391 --> 01:22:22,560
formulated.
Declaratively.

1527
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:25,470
Yeah,
adaptive behavior

1528
01:22:27,630 --> 01:22:28,463
inside the little circles.
All I meant really my plan is that like 

1529
01:22:31,591 --> 01:22:32,424
you draw on in your reservoir of 
habitual behaviors and put them into 

1530
01:22:35,521 --> 01:22:38,610
play to retain certain and so it's like 
even the guy rushing to the meeting,

1531
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:41,180
he doesn't have to think about how to 
walk like that's a hope.

1532
01:22:41,210 --> 01:22:43,320
Those sequences of behaviors are already
habitual.

1533
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,340
He just says,
well,

1534
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:45,923
the plan is I will walk there.
So that that's all I meant by that is 

1535
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,333
that you just have like your 
conceptualization of your present state 

1536
01:22:54,151 --> 01:22:57,390
is somewhat general and so as your 
conceptualization of your ideal future,

1537
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,433
but do you have specific plans to move 
you from one state to another and you 

1538
01:23:02,161 --> 01:23:03,900
can shift between the felt,
like I said,

1539
01:23:03,901 --> 01:23:06,200
this is a simplistic viewpoint.
It that structure.

1540
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:09,060
We'll look at the real structure of that
much later in the court stuff.

1541
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:10,533
That's all I mean by it's just those are
sub routines that will enable you to 

1542
01:23:14,801 --> 01:23:15,790
pursue your goal.

1543
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,153
That's all.
So what if you're doing something that 

1544
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:21,310
isn't adapted behavior,
it's not something like walking,

1545
01:23:21,311 --> 01:23:23,390
it's something like trying to make a 
good impression.

1546
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:25,963
But what if,
what if you're taking some sort of 

1547
01:23:27,731 --> 01:23:31,360
mythical knowledge that you've gotten 
about how to make things work out,

1548
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:32,433
but you can't formulate that the plan 
and you have this goal and this is how 

1549
01:23:35,501 --> 01:23:37,870
you're getting there,
but you have a plan together that way.

1550
01:23:37,871 --> 01:23:41,850
You're just trying to get their hope on 
a psychoanalysis,

1551
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:44,590
but you can have plants that you don't 
have a representation now,

1552
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:45,483
right?
I mean isn't that,

1553
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:46,493
no,
it only plans but even representations 

1554
01:23:47,591 --> 01:23:48,550
of the ideal,
right?

1555
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:50,680
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1556
01:23:50,681 --> 01:23:54,190
Well it depends on your left,
their level of representation.

1557
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:57,730
So you can have fantasies that could 
haven't made explicit like this.

1558
01:23:57,731 --> 01:23:58,780
By the way,
I think this,

1559
01:23:58,781 --> 01:24:01,930
this,
this is a fantasy and so is this,

1560
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,310
it's the fantasies.
That guy here,

1561
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:08,730
the guy,
you're a motivational fit guide,

1562
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:11,440
your motivational,
motivational judgments,

1563
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:15,640
your dreams about the future.
If you don't know what you're doing,

1564
01:24:15,641 --> 01:24:18,120
then you engage in exploratory behavior,
you know?

1565
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:19,120
So it can say,
well,

1566
01:24:19,121 --> 01:24:21,340
I have this idea of future in mind,
but I don't know how to get there.

1567
01:24:21,710 --> 01:24:25,900
Then you try out different patterns and 
just that's something we'll discuss next

1568
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:27,100
week.
So that's a,

1569
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:29,610
that's a default positions.
I know where I want to go on,

1570
01:24:29,611 --> 01:24:33,050
but I don't know how to get there.
So since I don't know how it,

1571
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:35,650
since I don't know what to do,
what can I do?

1572
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:38,860
That's a of a question,
but the answer is,

1573
01:24:38,861 --> 01:24:41,350
you know,
the answer to that is you start engaging

1574
01:24:41,351 --> 01:24:46,351
in exploratory behaviors of various 
sorts to make what you want to happen,

1575
01:24:46,871 --> 01:24:47,704
start happening.

1576
01:24:49,330 --> 01:24:51,340
That syncs the things that you do know 
how to do that.

1577
01:24:51,341 --> 01:24:52,600
You don't know,
you know how to do.

1578
01:24:52,810 --> 01:24:53,643
They just fall inside that little tickle
on top like things that you're doing 

1579
01:24:56,441 --> 01:24:58,600
without being aware of planning to do 
then that way.

1580
01:24:58,601 --> 01:24:59,434
But you're doing them

1581
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:00,423
well.
They would form sub routines of this 

1582
01:25:01,721 --> 01:25:03,420
basically.
So you,

1583
01:25:03,421 --> 01:25:04,160
you,
you like,

1584
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:04,993
you use what you know how to do 
automatically in your attempt to do 

1585
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:11,470
what,
what it is that you want to accomplish,

1586
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:12,423
like walking or moving your hands,
whatever you sequence those behaviors 

1587
01:25:15,851 --> 01:25:20,570
that you already know how to do.
So I'm in describing the first circle,

1588
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:23,480
you,
you basically described a kingdom,

1589
01:25:23,490 --> 01:25:27,210
right?
With an authoritarian rule and whatever.

1590
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:28,073
Yeah.
Are you going to go into and during the 

1591
01:25:29,401 --> 01:25:31,140
class what,
what kind of works best?

1592
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:32,230
Because,
uh,

1593
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:37,140
you've also described elsewhere,
I don't remember how democracy works and

1594
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:38,183
how it's not,
there isn't a general generalized 

1595
01:25:39,421 --> 01:25:40,220
hierarchy,
but,

1596
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:41,053
but people have a,
a hierarchy and there are certain 

1597
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:44,090
specializations.
Yeah.

1598
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:45,030
Yeah.
Well,

1599
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:45,863
you know,
we're still doing really introductory 

1600
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,440
introductory work can we will go into 
that?

1601
01:25:49,470 --> 01:25:50,303
Yeah,
absolutely.

1602
01:25:50,670 --> 01:25:52,170
Yeah.
Cause what I want to do is find out,

1603
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:56,820
well this is the myth of the way,
by the way,

1604
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:59,250
this is the sit up there with it.

1605
01:25:59,550 --> 01:26:02,280
It's this story that myths referred to 
most,

1606
01:26:02,281 --> 01:26:03,114
particularly as the structure of 
adaptive structures and how they 

1607
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:10,250
transformed and when the myth is when 
math is describing the world,

1608
01:26:10,490 --> 01:26:11,323
that's what it's describing said.
Well this is from the mythological 

1609
01:26:13,941 --> 01:26:14,774
perspective.
The world is constructed of the 

1610
01:26:15,951 --> 01:26:18,730
distinction between chaos and order.
It's like before chaos,

1611
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:19,573
in order divided,
you don't have anything and you could 

1612
01:26:21,141 --> 01:26:24,020
send them all,
this is chaos and this is order by order

1613
01:26:24,021 --> 01:26:24,854
is also something that has to transform 
because anything orderly that doesn't 

1614
01:26:27,681 --> 01:26:31,640
change dies because it's hard to say 
exactly why that is.

1615
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,240
Because things change and you have to 
keep up with them is the simple answer.

1616
01:26:35,241 --> 01:26:38,120
I have no idea why that is.
And just the as the case.

1617
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:41,540
So the mythical world is the world.
It's always stable,

1618
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:44,780
which is to say there's an unknown.
That's chaos.

1619
01:26:44,781 --> 01:26:48,470
It has a certain effect of Valence,
which is frightening and promising.

1620
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:50,390
That's always there,
the unknown.

1621
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:52,730
And then there's the no and that's your 
culture.

1622
01:26:52,731 --> 01:26:54,320
That's the story you shared with 
everyone.

1623
01:26:54,321 --> 01:26:57,380
That's your procedures to bring about 
what you want to bring about.

1624
01:26:57,670 --> 01:26:59,600
That's your kingdom.
That's always there.

1625
01:26:59,990 --> 01:27:02,450
And then there's a process that mediates
between the two.

1626
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:04,730
That's you.
That's always there.

1627
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:06,860
Those are the three constituent elements
of the world,

1628
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,800
chaos order and,
and the hero actually hold on those,

1629
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:15,530
those all out.
They're split into positive and negative

1630
01:27:15,531 --> 01:27:19,460
representations and mythologies as well.
So that's the mythological world.

1631
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:21,890
So,
and it's as far as I can tell,

1632
01:27:21,891 --> 01:27:24,800
it's a per ticket,
I said completely code internally,

1633
01:27:24,801 --> 01:27:28,100
coherent representation of experience.
And it includes,

1634
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:29,893
it's concentrates on if effect of 
Valence and motivational significance 

1635
01:27:32,601 --> 01:27:37,601
rather than on sensor structure.
So what sort of things would affect your

1636
01:27:37,831 --> 01:27:41,270
content is the new adaptive structure.
Okay.

1637
01:27:41,271 --> 01:27:42,104
What,
what do you mean by what sorts of 

1638
01:27:42,771 --> 01:27:43,160
things?

1639
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:43,993
Well,
w what would influence a particular 

1640
01:27:45,201 --> 01:27:49,940
shape that it takes a particular story 
that it tells hopefully past experience.

1641
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:53,030
I mean these are like these are 
fantasies,

1642
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:55,460
but to the degree that someone's 
healthy,

1643
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:56,503
their fantasies that are constructed on 
knowledge that's generated as a 

1644
01:27:59,481 --> 01:28:03,290
consequence of past endeavors.
So let's say like you're doing something

1645
01:28:03,291 --> 01:28:06,440
and you have to fail in a major way,
in an unexpected way.

1646
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:07,693
Well hopefully what happens,
but that basically means that there's a 

1647
01:28:10,341 --> 01:28:11,174
bunch of information about your 
circumstance that you failed to either 

1648
01:28:13,581 --> 01:28:16,040
notice or to adapt to.
That's what it means.

1649
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:19,100
If a failure comes as a big surprise,
as a general rule,

1650
01:28:19,190 --> 01:28:20,023
you're not paying attention.
So hopefully what happens when this is 

1651
01:28:22,371 --> 01:28:24,920
reconstructed,
that's what sort of on a higher plane is

1652
01:28:24,921 --> 01:28:28,970
that all of the anomalous information 
that you didn't take into account?

1653
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:32,660
Probably because it was threatening is 
now incorporated in here.

1654
01:28:33,050 --> 01:28:37,760
So hopefully that sounds like koons.
That is not exactly that.

1655
01:28:37,761 --> 01:28:39,560
What Kuhn,
what Kuhn was describing.

1656
01:28:39,561 --> 01:28:43,250
Look,
that's normal science,

1657
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:44,113
right?
Yeah.

1658
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:46,550
Max Revolutionary Side.
Let's see.

1659
01:28:46,551 --> 01:28:51,551
What Kuhn found basically was this 
structure in science,

1660
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:52,653
but what Kuhn found was only a 
substructure of a much broader process 

1661
01:28:56,181 --> 01:28:57,014
of adaptation.
So it's like a mythic structure of 

1662
01:28:59,271 --> 01:29:00,500
science then.
Yeah.

1663
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:01,620
Well,
I mean what,

1664
01:29:01,621 --> 01:29:02,454
what tune was describing is how 
cognitive systems stabilize and 

1665
01:29:05,551 --> 01:29:08,640
restructure,
but in the scientific domain.

1666
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:09,840
But you could just say,
well,

1667
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:10,733
cognitive systems stabilize and 
restructure no matter what we're 

1668
01:29:14,611 --> 01:29:16,370
applying to.
So cool.

1669
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:20,320
I now this is a very strange quirk of 
history because you sadness,

1670
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:23,420
like in 19 both 1930 said,
ah,

1671
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:27,090
this is not a religious systems progress
and I can't,

1672
01:29:27,091 --> 01:29:29,790
first reasons I cannot understand.
No one seemed to notice that.

1673
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:30,833
And then coon said at 1962 or 61 this is
how scientific systems transforming it 

1674
01:29:35,161 --> 01:29:38,550
was like what was the revelation?
But anyways,

1675
01:29:38,610 --> 01:29:39,443
who knows?
Maybe it's easier for people to accept 

1676
01:29:42,151 --> 01:29:42,984
and understand probably in the 
scientific domain because we feel that 

1677
01:29:44,761 --> 01:29:47,980
we understand that type of knowledge and
we do because the rules are,

1678
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:50,850
or explicit.
It's harder to understand how this works

1679
01:29:50,851 --> 01:29:52,980
when you're talking about they elance.

1680
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:54,473
Hmm.

1681
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,420
But the thing you have to remember,
it's like I'm trying to,

1682
01:29:57,421 --> 01:30:00,680
I'm trying to make this argument is as 
concrete as possible.

1683
01:30:01,220 --> 01:30:02,053
You have to,
Matt Damon says you have to because you 

1684
01:30:03,711 --> 01:30:07,580
have to know how to behave and you have 
to get what you need out of the world.

1685
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:12,260
And uh,
we have a structure for doing that.

1686
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:14,270
It's,
it's of primary importance.

1687
01:30:14,271 --> 01:30:15,800
That's why we do,
while we're alive,

1688
01:30:15,850 --> 01:30:17,750
everything else is just an adjunct to 
that.

1689
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:19,910
So when you're looking at this sort of 
thing,

1690
01:30:19,911 --> 01:30:20,744
you're looking at the most fundamental 
aspects of cognition as far as I can 

1691
01:30:23,361 --> 01:30:24,194
tell.

1692
01:30:24,570 --> 01:30:26,180
And you're,

1693
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:29,800
you're basically the purpose of 
cognition as far as I can tell,

1694
01:30:30,010 --> 01:30:32,740
it's to regulate emotion.
That's why we have,

1695
01:30:33,670 --> 01:30:36,610
that's what it's good for.
We want to not be in pain.

1696
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:37,503
We want to not be anxious.
We want to have a future that's full of 

1697
01:30:40,361 --> 01:30:41,194
hope and and satisfaction and we're 
always trying to adjust our models of 

1698
01:30:44,261 --> 01:30:45,094
the world,
hopefully to ensure that battle curves 

1699
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:51,430
when we do more specific cognitive 
exercises like sites,

1700
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:53,610
well that's a subspecialty 
specialization.

1701
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,840
It's very useful.
Hopefully it's very useful.

1702
01:30:56,710 --> 01:30:57,550
It's dangerous too.

1703
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:01,113
Other questions?

1704
01:31:04,650 --> 01:31:07,400
You may just say that the second is more
adaptive than the fall.

1705
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:11,160
Hopefully it doesn't happen.
It doesn't have to be,

1706
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:12,653
you don't describe something that he 
called retro regressive reestablishment 

1707
01:31:15,781 --> 01:31:16,614
of the Persona,
which is you're trying to do something 

1708
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:23,410
and you fail and when you reorganize 
yourself sphere of the taxes,

1709
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:24,313
much more constricted.
So like you can get worse as a 

1710
01:31:27,081 --> 01:31:27,914
consequence of this if you just cause 
all that anomalous information that you 

1711
01:31:32,361 --> 01:31:34,820
haven't processed.
You can't just let that in.

1712
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:35,893
It doesn't change you by letting it in.
You have to adjust your behavior to the 

1713
01:31:39,681 --> 01:31:42,260
anomalous territory and that takes a lot
of,

1714
01:31:42,290 --> 01:31:43,123
well,
a lot of ingenuity and a lot of hard 

1715
01:31:43,881 --> 01:31:45,530
work and that's why fried,
you know,

1716
01:31:45,531 --> 01:31:47,150
fried found by the end of his life.
He said,

1717
01:31:47,151 --> 01:31:51,620
well,
Mira consciousness doesn't entail cure.

1718
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:54,560
Well that's because just knowing that 
something,

1719
01:31:54,561 --> 01:31:55,570
there isn't the trick.

1720
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,060
The trick is if there's a threat that 
the environment,

1721
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:01,600
wait,
let's say people find you obnoxious,

1722
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:05,020
generally flow,
and that isn't what you want.

1723
01:32:05,021 --> 01:32:08,230
It's interfering with your,
your future as well.

1724
01:32:08,231 --> 01:32:09,064
The problem,
just knowing that people will find you 

1725
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:11,410
have nauseous,
that's normal.

1726
01:32:11,411 --> 01:32:12,244
That useful to assimilate that 
information is to take it in and move 

1727
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:18,783
differently and respond differently so 
that other people are no longer that 

1728
01:32:24,371 --> 01:32:26,590
category of things that's hostile 
towards you.

1729
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:30,340
So it's not,
it's not just heightened consciousness,

1730
01:32:30,341 --> 01:32:34,480
it's like total reconstruction of your 
behavioral outputs.

1731
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:35,433
You have to learn to pay attention and 
to listen to and to have some respect 

1732
01:32:38,651 --> 01:32:40,860
for somebody else's story.
And so

1733
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:44,470
the new system also depends on what's 
available.

1734
01:32:44,471 --> 01:32:45,930
Right.
And that's why you can repress me.

1735
01:32:45,931 --> 01:32:50,200
Is Your path available to talk to you 
about double the ideologies around?

1736
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:51,330
I mean,
yeah,

1737
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:52,010
because that's true.

1738
01:32:52,010 --> 01:32:56,090
It's easy to about what's there is what 
you're proud of.

1739
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:57,610
A lot of it.
Yeah.

1740
01:32:57,670 --> 01:32:58,550
Yeah,
that's true.

1741
01:32:58,570 --> 01:32:59,121
Well,
that's why.

1742
01:32:59,121 --> 01:33:01,840
And how brainwashing institutes 
basically work.

1743
01:33:01,930 --> 01:33:02,763
Will they toss the nautilus information 
on you until you crack and then they 

1744
01:33:06,071 --> 01:33:10,060
just throw a new system out to you.
When she grabbed onto immediately it,

1745
01:33:10,061 --> 01:33:13,470
Koreans did that during effectively two 
American prisoners of war in the fifties

1746
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:15,700
so now I'm going,
I mean,

1747
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:18,280
it's not just,
that's how the army works.

1748
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:23,700
It's how fraternities work in a,
in a more minimal sands.

1749
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:26,180
That's how initiation ceremony 
ceremonies.

1750
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:29,230
So it's not always negative that that 
will curse.

1751
01:33:29,231 --> 01:33:30,064
I mean it's,
it's only negative if what your hand is 

1752
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:33,303
less useful than what you had
or less useful than what you could have 

1753
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:39,220
constructed yourself.

1754
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:47,590
Okay.
I know that was sort of randomly.

1755
01:33:52,120 --> 01:33:57,120
Any other questions?
What's the process of coming up with the

1756
01:33:57,671 --> 01:33:58,504
whole system like that?
Does that imply that you should have 

1757
01:34:00,761 --> 01:34:05,380
power over it or that it's exploration?
What

1758
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,740
are you,
where are you in?

1759
01:34:13,770 --> 01:34:18,760
Can you talk about you're here,
you're the thing that moves from here to

1760
01:34:18,761 --> 01:34:21,160
here,
but I mean,

1761
01:34:21,161 --> 01:34:23,560
if you're the person who comes up with 
this system,

1762
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:24,473
yeah,

1763
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:26,870
that's right.
That's right.

1764
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:30,980
That's why the way is the proper path of
life from a mythological perspective.

1765
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:35,600
And who identify with the way is instead
of identifying with this,

1766
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:36,813
where are with this,
knowing that they're temporary is to 

1767
01:34:39,801 --> 01:34:40,634
identify with this because it's the only
thing that's constant across the 

1768
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:46,340
constant spans.
You say,

1769
01:34:46,341 --> 01:34:47,174
well,
there was no one territory and there's 

1770
01:34:49,071 --> 01:34:49,904
unknown territory and there's the 
process by which what is generated out 

1771
01:34:52,491 --> 01:34:54,290
of the other.
And you said,

1772
01:34:54,291 --> 01:34:56,030
well where does the individual fit?
Basically,

1773
01:34:56,031 --> 01:35:00,740
where are you?
Well if you're doing this voluntarily,

1774
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:01,913
then you're identifying with the process
by which cultural information is 

1775
01:35:04,491 --> 01:35:07,130
generated rather than with the 
information itself.

1776
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:11,600
So that makes you always on the always 
in the proper locale,

1777
01:35:11,601 --> 01:35:13,460
so to speak,
to construct the world.

1778
01:35:13,670 --> 01:35:15,830
That's where it will be less wear will 
be interesting.

1779
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:18,860
Occurrence is taking place.
That's a proper place to live.

1780
01:35:19,060 --> 01:35:19,893
I'll give,
I'll close with that as an example of 

1781
01:35:21,471 --> 01:35:21,921
that.
Say,

1782
01:35:21,921 --> 01:35:24,820
well here's another symbol that you're 
all familiar with

1783
01:35:28,610 --> 01:35:32,750
that that's dao and down means two 
things.

1784
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:35,810
It either means the way,
depending on the translation,

1785
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:39,500
the way which is that or it means 
meaning.

1786
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:43,820
So to live in Dallas,
to live in meaning.

1787
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:48,020
And this symbol is a symbol of the 
totality of the world.

1788
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:49,840
And why is that?
Plus,

1789
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:54,850
because this is chaos and there's 
usually give it the feminine connotation

1790
01:35:55,641 --> 01:35:58,280
for reasons that we'll discuss later.
And this is ordered

1791
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:01,183
and it's chaos and it's the split 
between chaos and order and the mutual 

1792
01:36:04,311 --> 01:36:05,144
coexistence that makes the world.
And this dog is black because anything 

1793
01:36:11,451 --> 01:36:13,550
orderly can immediately be turned into 
chaos,

1794
01:36:13,551 --> 01:36:14,384
more or less unpredictably.
And sometimes by your own efforts and 

1795
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:21,440
chaos can also be turned in order.
That's why this little dog is white.

1796
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:24,380
Also by your own efforts.
Exploration does that.

1797
01:36:25,140 --> 01:36:25,973
And Dow,
the man who lives in down lives on 

1798
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:33,140
deadline with one foot in order and one 
foot in chaos and the reason for that.

1799
01:36:35,931 --> 01:36:38,000
So that's where all the interesting 
things are happening.

1800
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:39,860
That's where the information is flowing.

1801
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:42,230
If you're all here,
you predict everything,

1802
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:43,483
well that's secure,
but it's boring and it's not just 

1803
01:36:45,861 --> 01:36:47,480
boring.
Symbolic,

1804
01:36:47,830 --> 01:36:48,663
it defines boring.
There's no new information happening 

1805
01:36:51,711 --> 01:36:52,910
here.
And if you're here,

1806
01:36:52,911 --> 01:36:53,744
well there are so overwhelmed with new 
information that that you can't do 

1807
01:36:57,381 --> 01:36:59,810
anything with it and you want to be 
here.

1808
01:37:00,530 --> 01:37:03,200
And if you're here and you're doing 
this,

1809
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:06,920
you're paying attention to anomalous 
information always.

1810
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:11,510
You're allowing that to destabilize this
structure when it's necessary,

1811
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:12,673
they have to do this.
That's the hero in the belly of the 

1812
01:37:14,151 --> 01:37:14,871
beast,
by the way,

1813
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:19,020
are the sun would packs it's way out of 
the dragon at night and back up.

1814
01:37:20,510 --> 01:37:21,343
So that's the path of the hero.
And in terms of systems that are stable 

1815
01:37:25,071 --> 01:37:29,210
over time and an authoritarian system 
says this is not necessary.

1816
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:33,640
So if the case as things change,
a system that's property,

1817
01:37:33,650 --> 01:37:34,483
government said,
well we need this but we also need this 

1818
01:37:39,110 --> 01:37:39,943
and therefore we're going to have to 
allow a certain amount of disorder into 

1819
01:37:42,651 --> 01:37:45,560
the system so that flexibility can be 
maintained.

1820
01:37:47,610 --> 01:37:48,630
And the,
the,

1821
01:37:48,690 --> 01:37:52,160
the trick is belts.
It's like too much novelty.

1822
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:55,800
Everything degenerates too much,
order,

1823
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:57,660
everything.
Petrifies.

1824
01:37:57,870 --> 01:37:58,703
You wore the right on the proper edge 
and the way that you can tell you're on 

1825
01:38:02,811 --> 01:38:05,220
the edge when you were interested in 
something that's,

1826
01:38:05,221 --> 01:38:06,780
that's the sign that says you say,
well,

1827
01:38:06,781 --> 01:38:09,330
there's an effect of sign post that 
tells you when you're here.

1828
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:11,970
If you're here,
you're interested.

1829
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:14,070
If you're here,
you're terrified.

1830
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:15,240
You're here,
your board,

1831
01:38:15,450 --> 01:38:20,450
it would be right in the middle of that 
and then that means your brain is on and

1832
01:38:20,670 --> 01:38:21,503
it's optimal in an optimal manner 
because your sensory systems are 

1833
01:38:24,661 --> 01:38:26,880
probably heightened because you're a 
little bit anxious.

1834
01:38:27,270 --> 01:38:29,530
You're doing a lot of exploration.
We find it that pleasurable,

1835
01:38:29,531 --> 01:38:32,340
like last left frontal activation.
People like that.

1836
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:35,970
That's incentive reward pleasure.
That's what cocaine does to you is this.

1837
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:37,740
When you're here you're on.

1838
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:41,070
It's analgesic too,
which is kind of interesting.

1839
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:43,410
There's no work flow.
Yeah.

1840
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:46,470
It's not quite though because the 
problem with things like flow,

1841
01:38:46,471 --> 01:38:47,304
and this is Joseph Campbell's thing too,
is they're always talking about 

1842
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:55,020
following your happiness.
This is not right to get here.

1843
01:38:55,410 --> 01:39:00,390
What you have to do is look at things 
that you hate from is no one would buy a

1844
01:39:00,391 --> 01:39:04,560
book that tells them that it's a flow,
but no,

1845
01:39:04,561 --> 01:39:06,480
but this is amazing.
This is a major problem.

1846
01:39:06,810 --> 01:39:07,643
Um,
problem with new age philosophy in 

1847
01:39:08,911 --> 01:39:09,744
general.
It's the normally that you have to face 

1848
01:39:12,950 --> 01:39:13,783
and the a priori motivational 
significance of an anomaly is terror 

1849
01:39:20,650 --> 01:39:23,640
because otherwise people would be in 
flow all the time and they're not,

1850
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:56,720
it
looks expensive.
