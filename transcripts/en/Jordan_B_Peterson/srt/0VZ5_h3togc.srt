00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,230
Hi everyone.
I want to tell you about an event that's

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:09,231
going to take place in Toronto on July 
18th at 7:30 PM it's going to be held at

3
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:15,930
the Canada Christian College 50 Jervais 
drive in Toronto.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,880
The event is entitled Bill See 16 one 
year later,

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,100
sex ideology and compelled speech in 
Canada and here.

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,930
Here's the background detail.
Bill [inaudible] has incorporated gender

7
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:31,764
identity and expression and to Canadian 
human rights law and the criminal code 

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,083
within a broader policy context 
predicated on the idea that gender is 

9
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:40,974
solely a social construct.
The effect is rippling through the 

10
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:46,620
social world affecting schools,
universities,

11
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,650
the healthcare systems,
the law and journalism.

12
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,860
What implications does this have for 
free speech?

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,023
What punitive measures can and does the 
law imposed on those who violate its 

14
00:00:57,871 --> 00:00:58,704
provisions?
There is no scientific evidence that 

15
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:01,974
supports the idea that gender and sex 
and biology and sexual proclivity very 

16
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:07,584
independently,
but that position is now instantiated 

17
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:10,800
into Canadian law.

18
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,510
The following four panelists will 
discuss these issues and more.

19
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,693
Lindsay Shepherd.
Lindsay rose to prominence after staff 

20
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:21,714
at Wilfrid laurier university,
subjected her to a disciplinary hearing 

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,340
for showing a video discussing bill see 
16 to her students while she was serving

22
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:30,174
as a teaching assistant that produced 
the biggest scandal in Canadian 

23
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:36,960
university history and very little 
evidence by the way that Wilfrid laurier

24
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:41,961
university learned its lesson.
She will be speaking at this event about

25
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:45,720
the tactics and effects of trans 
activism on university campuses.

26
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,900
Barbara K we'll also speak she's a 
teacher,

27
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:52,290
author and an influential columnist for 
the Canadian newspaper,

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,333
the National Post.
She will be speaking on the impact 

29
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:56,574
suppression of free speech is having on 
journalism illustrating with the 

30
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:00,084
personal experiences she and others have
had in the areas of indigenous 

31
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,374
correctness.
She was fired as a regular contributor 

32
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:10,500
to a CBC radio show for incorrect 
remarks made elsewhere.

33
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,740
She will speak about the phenomenon 
known in Arabic as Ketman defined by one

34
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:16,944
scholar as the position taken by those 
who desire to be at one with others in 

35
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:23,370
order not to be alone.
Dr Deborah,

36
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:28,380
so we'll speak as well.
She holds a Phd From York University and

37
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,110
writes about the science and politics of
sex and culture.

38
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,430
Dr So is a columnist for playboy.com and
the globe and mail.

39
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,443
Her writing has been widely featured in 
such publications as Harper's The Wall 

40
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,363
Street Journal and the La Times.
She will be discussing the science of 

41
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:44,724
gender,
what makes someone feel female or male 

42
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,993
and why gender ideology which denies the
influence of biology is harmful as she 

43
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:53,604
states.
The common belief nowadays is that 

44
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:57,720
gender is a spectrum and that sexual 
orientation,

45
00:02:57,721 --> 00:03:00,730
gender identity and gender are 
unrelated.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,730
This is not what the scientific research
indicates.

47
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,193
Jared Brown rounds out the panel.
He's lead counsel at Brown litigation 

48
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,550
aiding his clients in matters relating 
to commercial and employment disputes,

49
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,533
breaches of contract,
shareholder disputes and collection of 

50
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:16,930
accounts.

51
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,710
Last year he spoke to the Canadian 
Senate about the dangers of bill.

52
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:21,544
See 16 jared will be speaking about the 
legal aspects of [inaudible] including 

53
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:27,034
its legislation of compelled speech,
the opinions of Canadian and US courts 

54
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,563
regarding such speech and his experience
of the subterfuge and dishonesty of the 

55
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:38,380
proponents of the legislation.
In his words,

56
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,723
the politicking behind the scenes of my 
appearance at the Senate made it clear 

57
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:47,230
that the intention of the proponents was
to control speech all along.

58
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,173
Serena sing will moderate.
Serena is an ex social worker and an 

59
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:54,910
emerging political and social 
commentator.

60
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:55,923
She organized the largest discussion on 
free speech ever held in Canada on 

61
00:03:59,021 --> 00:03:59,854
November 11th,
2017 as well as this one year later 

62
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:06,100
event.
I'm really interested in this gathering.

63
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,760
I'm going to try to make it at least to 
attend and listen.

64
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,250
Although I'm coming back from London 
that day,

65
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:14,680
and if there's any delays,
I won't be able to manage it.

66
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:15,514
But I would strongly encourage everyone 
who can manage it to go and listen to 

67
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:22,430
these panelists.
It's an important discussion and uh,

68
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,940
it should be an extraordinarily 
interesting event.

69
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,000
Thanks for your attention.
Bye Bye.
