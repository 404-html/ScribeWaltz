1
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,420
Tell her where everyone.
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,740
Where do we go?
Good to see all of you.

3
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,210
So
first question,

4
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,853
well,
I guess I could catch you up on what's 

5
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:42,600
been happening first in case you were 
vaguely interested,

6
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,500
most of you probably know or some of you
know anyways,

7
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,190
about what happened at Wilfrid laurier 
university this week or two weeks ago,

8
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,920
a teaching assistant named Lindsay 
Shepherd was interrogated,

9
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:02,190
I would say,
by the typical suspects,

10
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,323
the kind of postmodern,
Neo Marxist that I've been talking 

11
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:08,640
about,
holder into an inquisition and,

12
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,540
um,

13
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,493
proceeded to rape her over the coals for
having the goal to show a video that 

14
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,100
featured me about a year ago on our 
Canadian TV show called the agenda.

15
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:24,603
Um,

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,670
they accused her of violating the 
criminal code essentially,

17
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,320
and the Canadian human rights code,

18
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,173
um,

19
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,570
under the provisions of Bill 
[inaudible],

20
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,533
which was the bill I warned about last 
year and accused her of transphobia and 

21
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:41,024
making an unsafe environment.
And then they accused me of being 

22
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:44,114
Hitler,
which was really quite interesting 

23
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:48,530
because I've never been accused about 
being Hitler.

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,410
So I modified my kermit puppet here.
Um,

25
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,610
which,
see,

26
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,110
you can probably see that I guess,
and I've done a response video which I'm

27
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:03,050
going to launch pretty soon.
So this is a Hitler,

28
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:07,760
the frog and the spokes frog by the way.
And He,

29
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:11,900
uh,
well this is what we've come to.

30
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,463
So.

31
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,650
All right,
let's answer some questions.

32
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,750
I'm going to start with Pigeonhole,
which,

33
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,603
uh,
is the site that allows people to vote 

34
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:26,300
on questions.
And so the top voted question is,

35
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:27,134
how do you identify,
how do you justify a rejection of 

36
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:30,134
identity arianism when a pillar of the 
neo marxists strategy is to 

37
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:36,890
demographically replaced the indigenous 
people of Europe?

38
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,920
London,
it's less than half ethnically English.

39
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,170
Um,
okay.

40
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,750
So let's take that question apart.
First of all,

41
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,153
it isn't self evident to me that it is 
specifically a neo Marxist strategy to 

42
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:53,540
demographically replaced the indigenous 
peoples of Europe.

43
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,374
And um,
I don't think that's the strategy 

44
00:02:56,481 --> 00:02:57,314
anyways,
even if that's the outcome because you 

45
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:00,730
have to distinguish strategy and 
outcome.

46
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,153
Um,
the strategy and principle is to bring 

47
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:07,440
in immigrants to balance out the 
declining birthrate.

48
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,373
Now I'm not saying I agree with that,
I'm just saying that that's what the 

49
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:11,494
strategy is a and then the next part of 
the question is predicated on the 

50
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:21,931
assumption that identity Arianism is 
necessarily the answer to the problem of

51
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,043
the problem that's being identified,
which is characterized as excess 

52
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:29,254
immigration.

53
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,723
First of all,
we'd have to figure out exactly what 

54
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:36,661
identitarianism means because it isn't 
clear if it means radical,

55
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:38,854
right wing ethnic nationalism.
I don't think that that's going to be 

56
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:43,084
particularly constructive if it means 
having a sensible discussion about what 

57
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:50,830
the appropriate limits might be on 
immigration,

58
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,133
uh,
and to think about that over the long 

59
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:56,020
run and also to have a serious 
discussion about

60
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,050
the degree to which say Islam and the 
West,

61
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:05,440
the values of Islam and the West are 
actually commensurate.

62
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,370
Then that has to be obviously has to be 
done.

63
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,580
But I'm so I'm afraid that to answer 
that question,

64
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:15,664
I'd have to know more about exactly how 
these terms were being were being 

65
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:19,714
defined.
Especially with regards to 

66
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,610
identitarianism because it's a vague 
word.

67
00:04:22,611 --> 00:04:23,444
And so that's all I can do with that.
I lose my ability to think straight or 

68
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:33,460
intelligently in confrontational or 
unfriendly social situations.

69
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,670
Any suggestions for adoptation or 
improvement?

70
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,320
Well,
a couple.

71
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,880
I suppose.
One is that when you get nervous in this

72
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,680
kind of situation that you're 
describing,

73
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,910
what often happens to people is they 
start paying attention to themselves.

74
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:49,744
They get self conscious so you know,
let's say I got self conscious all of a 

75
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:54,244
sudden during this q and a.
What would happen is that I'd start 

76
00:04:58,161 --> 00:04:58,994
paying attention to the questions and 
the screen and what I'm doing and I'd 

77
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:03,184
start paying attention to how I was 
feeling and to the nervousness and then 

78
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:07,084
I'd start to get aware that I was not 
responding properly and that would make 

79
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:11,674
me more nervous and then I would get 
more aware of that and that can just 

80
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:15,784
shut me down entirely.
And that's happened to me now and then 

81
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:18,214
in a lecture and sometimes almost 
happened when I was talking to Sam 

82
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,633
Harris the first time.

83
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,360
I'm all right.
I paused for a long time and then became

84
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:26,194
aware of the pause and then anyways,
what you have to do in a situation like 

85
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:34,660
that is it's not so much that you have 
to stop attending to yourself because if

86
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:38,140
you start thinking,
I should stop attending to myself,

87
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,390
then you'll just think about yourself 
more.

88
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,493
What you have to do instead is pay more 
attention to the situation and to the 

89
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:48,004
people that you're talking to.
So you have to increase the degree to 

90
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:51,634
which you're at attending outwardly and 
that'll stop you from attending 

91
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,010
inwardly.
Um,

92
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,290
that's a very effective technique.
You can practice that.

93
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,270
Generally speaking,
every time you get nervous,

94
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:09,530
start paying more attention and that'll,
that'll,

95
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,260
that'll help you out a lot.
Um,

96
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,163
the,
a really good suggestion for social 

97
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:19,070
anxiety in general is that if you see 
most people,

98
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,933
but not everyone,
but most people have enough implicit 

99
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:22,934
social skill because they were 
reasonably socialized when they were 

100
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:30,230
children so that they do know how to act
in social situations,

101
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:31,064
but they get anxious and then that 
interferes with them implementing what 

102
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:34,520
they know.

103
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,353
Just like if you're a pianist and you 
get anxious and self conscious while 

104
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:39,704
you're playing,
you'll forget what you know because 

105
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,880
while you've activated a different part 
of your brain,

106
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,543
if you can remember to pay attention and
you can direct your attention outward 

107
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:52,520
and you attend hard enough,
then what will happen and try to put the

108
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:55,130
other person at ease and try to ask them
questions.

109
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,263
Then that'll kick in the automatic 
because you're paying attention to what 

110
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,700
the person is doing into their facial 
expressions and all of that.

111
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,250
That will clue in the automatic and 
implicit

112
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,630
knowledge that you have and make things 
much more smooth and,

113
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,950
and uh,
and anxiety free.

114
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,130
So attention really attention really 
plays a huge role in regulating anxiety.

115
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,510
I would.
Lauren asks,

116
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:32,840
I would love to hear you do a lecture 
series on raising children properly.

117
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,390
Is that something you would consider?
Well,

118
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,343
in my new book,
I've written a chapter on that called 

119
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,070
don't let your children do anything that
makes you dislike them.

120
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,150
And I've laid out a bunch of,
uh,

121
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,160
I've laid out a philosophy of care and 
discipline that's predicated partly on a

122
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,014
French philosophical legal notion,
which is do not multiply rules beyond 

123
00:07:59,151 --> 00:07:59,984
necessity.
It's sort of like a legal equivalent to 

124
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,473
[inaudible] razor and an English common 
law principle is which is used minimal 

125
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:09,560
necessary force.
And I think the Union of those two,

126
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:14,030
which is don't have too many rules,
but make sure that you properly enforced

127
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:14,864
the ones that you do have is a good 
start for how you might consider your 

128
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:20,540
attitude with regards to raising 
children.

129
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,990
The other thing you have to figure out 
is exactly what's your aim.

130
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,453
And you know,
one of the aims that people have had 

131
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,400
most recently pushed by clueless 
psychologists,

132
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:32,234
I would say,
is that you want children to have high 

133
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:34,334
self esteem and a,
that's actually a large part trait 

134
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:43,310
neuroticism anyways,
but it can be modified to some degree.

135
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:46,070
Jerome Kagan has done some very 
interesting work on that.

136
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,920
But,
um,

137
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,490
the best thing to do,
the,

138
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,453
I think,
the best thing to orient yourself 

139
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:57,474
towards with regards to children is that
you're trying to make your child your 

140
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:06,270
children or help your children to be 
delightful in the eyes of others.

141
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,950
And so that means they have to be 
reasonably well socialized.

142
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:10,784
And that really takes place between the 
ages of two and four because what you 

143
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:16,050
want for your children is that when they
go out into public,

144
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,140
when they're away from you or even with 
you for that matter,

145
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,820
what you want for your children is for 
other people to genuinely like them.

146
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,103
Because if they behave reasonably and 
they attend properly to adults and they 

147
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:31,740
know how to play with other children,
then wherever they go,

148
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,910
they're going to be,

149
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,323
um,

150
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,490
unless they encounter someone truly 
malevolent,

151
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:39,980
they're going to be welcomed with smiles
and open arms.

152
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:40,814
And that's not going to be fake because 
almost every human being actually likes 

153
00:09:44,571 --> 00:09:49,571
children if they're reasonably behaved.
And so your job is to make your children

154
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:54,260
highly socially desirable because that 
opens up the world to them.

155
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,350
So they're,
that's not a lecture series,

156
00:09:57,351 --> 00:10:01,130
but it's a little lecture looking at 
myself,

157
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:02,240
honestly,
John says,

158
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:05,180
I'm deeply envious and resentful of 
others happiness.

159
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,130
How do I turn this around?
Well,

160
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,330
John,
I would say you've started to turn it on

161
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,343
around already because you have at least
come to the conclusion that you're 

162
00:10:16,461 --> 00:10:18,860
deeply envious and resentful of others 
happiness.

163
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:21,080
So you do have the damn problem 
diagnosed.

164
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,820
So one of the things you might do is 
figure out what you would like instead.

165
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,490
Like how would you like to feel about 
the world,

166
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,933
you know,
because you're implying that being 

167
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:34,010
deeply envious and resentful isn't for 
the best.

168
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,173
So let's assume that you would rather be
pleased about other people's successes 

169
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,340
and not envious.
Well,

170
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,170
you know,
the first thing you might think is,

171
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,980
well maybe you have to do some writing 
or at least some thinking.

172
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,640
It's like maybe the alternative would be
happy,

173
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,400
be happy about other's success and 
happiness.

174
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:00,260
Well maybe you should start by thinking 
about why you might be happy about their

175
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:01,094
happiness.
It's not like happiness is a zero sum 

176
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:03,171
game,
you know,

177
00:11:03,171 --> 00:11:05,280
it's not like,
it's not an,

178
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:07,790
I believe me,
I'm taking your question seriously and I

179
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:08,624
think that what you're saying 
characterize is plenty of people and I 

180
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:14,390
think that you're being deeply honest,
noticing it,

181
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,720
happiness isn't a zero sum game,
you know,

182
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,690
lots of people can be happy at the same 
time.

183
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,853
And do you really want to live in a 
world where other people are less happy 

184
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,720
in what possible manner without be 
useful and good for you in the medium to

185
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:31,340
longterm?
It might make you feel,

186
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,830
you know,
grudgingly,

187
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,633
uh,

188
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,410
satisfied,
you know,

189
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:38,244
in a dark way temporarily,
but it's not a very good long term 

190
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:41,514
strategy.
So I would say you got to think it 

191
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:44,100
through,
you know,

192
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,993
what,
how is it that you would like to view 

193
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:47,334
the world?
How do you think that would be best for 

194
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:49,254
you?
I mean as if you were taking care of 

195
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:53,100
yourself,
like you,

196
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,360
like you're someone who deserves to be 
taken care of.

197
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:57,490
Think about how you'd like to have the 
world,

198
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,623
how he'd like to view the world.
And one of the ways you can do that too 

199
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:02,344
is to think about some people that you 
admire and try to figure out how they 

200
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:09,220
look at the world or even ask them,
you know,

201
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:10,054
because maybe then you can find out what
it is about your thought patterns that 

202
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:16,780
are driving you down this dark road.
So

203
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,983
why are you now Francoise St Onge asks,
why are you hiding the amount you 

204
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:27,514
receive from Patriot?
And I found it very motivating to see 

205
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:30,604
the amount skyrocket and tell cloud to 
be part of this as if you were an 

206
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,374
artist.
I now feel more like I'm buying a 

207
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:38,650
product and I find it less appealing.
Yeah.

208
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:39,484
Well it's one of those things where I'm 
kind of damned if I do and damned if I 

209
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:42,724
don't,
you know,

210
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,940
and I don't know what's correct.
I guess I probably got tired of the sort

211
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:50,524
of more left leaning,
let's say radical left leaning press 

212
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:55,264
people jumping up and down on me every 
chance they got because people were 

213
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,270
donating money for,
for services that I particularly rent,

214
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,490
you know,
that I render essentially for free.

215
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,150
Um,
you know,

216
00:13:09,151 --> 00:13:09,450
I,
I,

217
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,850
there must have been 10 articles in the 
last week following the Lindsay shepherd

218
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:18,030
a incident pointing out that I'm somehow
being manipulative and,

219
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,653
and,
uh,

220
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,830
evil in a capitalist sort of way for 
daring to

221
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,633
allow people to donate money to help 
support what I'm doing and it gets kind 

222
00:13:30,721 --> 00:13:33,540
of tiring.
And so I don't know,

223
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,433
I just.
And I guess I also thought that maybe 

224
00:13:36,061 --> 00:13:37,440
there's a part of it,
it's like,

225
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,800
well,
I wouldn't exactly call it bragging,

226
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:42,420
but because it's not,
but

227
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,330
ah,
that's about good enough.

228
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:50,150
I mean,
it was an appeal to privacy I suppose in

229
00:13:50,151 --> 00:13:52,040
part two.
I don't know if it's the right thing.

230
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,590
I could do a poll on twitter and find 
out.

231
00:13:54,591 --> 00:13:57,380
I guess I did that first of other things
this week.

232
00:13:57,381 --> 00:13:58,830
So anyways,
that's,

233
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,960
that's the answer to that user in.
Okay.

234
00:14:02,961 --> 00:14:05,540
Says I love you man.
Keep it up.

235
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,710
Well,
that's a pretty good question and uh,

236
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,790
I'm trying to keep it up.
I'm actually feeling quite a bit better.

237
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:11,624
I was actually happy today and it's been
so rare for the last while that I could 

238
00:14:16,431 --> 00:14:18,830
hardly even recognize what it felt like 
so,

239
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,993
but I'm definitely feeling better.
I'm getting some energy in the morning 

240
00:14:23,151 --> 00:14:26,060
and so I'm,
I'm really happy about that.

241
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:27,110
So thanks.
Anyways,

242
00:14:27,111 --> 00:14:27,950
I appreciate it.

243
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,450
Thoughts on the radical left and they're
superficial view,

244
00:14:33,451 --> 00:14:37,530
belief and value on the environment.
How has this influenced by their own raw

245
00:14:37,531 --> 00:14:38,670
emotions?
Inviting,

246
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:39,900
questionable,
immoral,

247
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,420
and dangerous actions despite good 
intentions?

248
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,673
Well,
I don't really buy the whole good 

249
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:45,900
intentions thing.
I mean,

250
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:48,390
I think that it's really hard to have 
good intentions.

251
00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:52,710
Like John,
the question are just answered.

252
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,770
Uh,
you know,

253
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:56,630
John said,
looking at myself honestly,

254
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:59,180
I'm deeply envious and resentful of 
others happiness.

255
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,343
Well,
if you listen to the Lindsay shepherd 

256
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:07,871
recording at Wilfrid laurier university 
and you listen to the professors and the

257
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:11,090
administrators,
I think that it's,

258
00:15:11,091 --> 00:15:11,840
uh,
it's,

259
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,673
it's absurd to start with the 
presupposition that they have good 

260
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:16,754
intentions.
I don't think they have good intentions 

261
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:19,520
at all.
So,

262
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,141
um,
but you know,

263
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:25,430
we could give the devil his due and say 
that there are people on the left end of

264
00:15:25,431 --> 00:15:26,330
the spectrum,
like,

265
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,810
like there are all parts of the spectrum
who are,

266
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,703
are trying to do good things,
but having good intentions and figuring 

267
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:34,064
out how to do well in the world are our 
good intentions are only the beginning 

268
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,643
and people are always influenced by raw 
emotions and fuzzy thinking and it's 

269
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:49,280
hard to think critically and it's hard 
to plan strategically and it's hard to,

270
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,930
to intervene in the world in a way that 
doesn't cause trouble,

271
00:15:53,931 --> 00:15:57,110
which is partly why I recommend to 
people that they start local.

272
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,973
You know,
you can't even trust your own good 

273
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:02,174
intentions to some degree because you 
have to test out what you do when you 

274
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:06,194
have good intentions and see if it 
actually produces the result that's 

275
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:10,004
intended.
But I wouldn't make the case to begin 

276
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:14,024
with that,
especially on the radical end of the 

277
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:17,504
left.
I think it's unbelievably motivated by 

278
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:20,960
resentment.
So

279
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,980
how does one save a marriage when it 
seems that there is no longer attraction

280
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,570
both physically and intellectually?
There are kids involved,

281
00:16:31,571 --> 00:16:34,030
which is the main reason for wanting to 
save the marriage.

282
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,160
Huh?
Well,

283
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,980
alright.
I know a couple of things about that.

284
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,383
I mean the first thing I would say is 
that if you haven't had any intimate 

285
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,040
interaction with one another for quite a
long period of time,

286
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:53,490
that can put both people into a stagnant
state where desire starts to slip away.

287
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:58,900
What what sex therapists recommend under
such conditions is to,

288
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:03,700
well essentially start in some ways,
start dating again so you could ask your

289
00:17:03,701 --> 00:17:07,150
partner to go out to a movie or 
something like that and you know,

290
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:12,151
maybe when you come home you could,
you could neck for a little while,

291
00:17:13,331 --> 00:17:14,164
like teenagers.
That's probably a word no one uses 

292
00:17:16,391 --> 00:17:17,224
anymore,
but kinda pull back and you got to 

293
00:17:19,181 --> 00:17:19,570
agree.

294
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:24,570
Say not to engage in full sexual 
activity for a while,

295
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:26,980
but to tease each other and to play a 
bit.

296
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,570
Even if you're not attracted,
you have to act.

297
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,060
Acted out for awhile and hopefully you 
can get the motor running again.

298
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,343
The other thing I would say is that you 
guys might want to sit down and make a 

299
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,353
joint plan.
It's like what a marriage is like a 

300
00:17:44,351 --> 00:17:45,184
story that two people are acting out 
simultaneously and you have to have 

301
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:54,050
shared goals and because you're both 
rowing the same boat,

302
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:57,690
let's say if you don't have a 
destination in mind,

303
00:17:57,691 --> 00:17:58,830
then,
well,

304
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,060
maybe you're rowing in circles or maybe 
you're just standing still.

305
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,430
So I would say work hard to put some 
romance back in the relationship,

306
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:09,790
you know,
you could say to each other,

307
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,653
look,
let's try this for six months and just 

308
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:12,594
see how it goes.
We'll have two dates a week for the 

309
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:17,160
first month.
We won't have any sex,

310
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:19,920
but we'll play around and then,
you know,

311
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:21,530
we'll see how that goes and,
and,

312
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,110
but we'll try it out for the,
for,

313
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,180
for the whole,
for the whole six months.

314
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,970
There are reasons to save a marriage.
I mean,

315
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:30,804
it's hard on kids.
Divorce is really hard on kids and it's 

316
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:35,710
hard on the adults involved too.
Um,

317
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,010
so I would say

318
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,450
you have to negotiate an agreement and 
you,

319
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:44,683
you know,
you could try the future authoring 

320
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:46,660
program,
both of you,

321
00:18:46,661 --> 00:18:48,460
what,
what I would recommend for example,

322
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,280
is that you each do the future authoring
program separately.

323
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:52,683
So that's that self authoring dotcom 
because then you both have a life plan 

324
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,313
and then you could sit down and read 
each other's future authoring plans and 

325
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:01,054
see if you have some things in common 
and then see if you can figure out how 

326
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:08,710
to support each other with regards to 
each of you obtaining what you want.

327
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,113
So Paul Maloney asks,
you edited out a disagreement with 

328
00:19:14,201 --> 00:19:15,790
Camille Paglia.
What was it?

329
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,070
No,
no,

330
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,570
that's not the case.
There was a piece edited out,

331
00:19:19,571 --> 00:19:21,490
but it wasn't because there was a 
disagreement,

332
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:24,580
it was because there was some glitch in 
the video or something like that.

333
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,310
Generally speaking,
and you know,

334
00:19:27,311 --> 00:19:29,170
I can't say this with absolute 
certainty,

335
00:19:29,171 --> 00:19:30,004
but I do.
And so does my crew do everything we 

336
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:33,484
possibly can to leave the videos alone 
except for getting rid of things that 

337
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,790
would be of no interest to anyone that 
are mistakes.

338
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,803
So there was no disagreement.
Are you interested in coming to 

339
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:45,400
Australia?
Yes.

340
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:48,220
I've been invited a couple of times but 
it hasn't worked out yet.

341
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:52,420
But um,
my book will be published in Australia I

342
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:55,710
think sometime in January as well.
And uh,

343
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:56,544
I imagined that all becoming there at 
some point in order to talk about my 

344
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:02,434
book and so on.

345
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,533
Tray says,
how can a person go through the future 

346
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:08,724
authoring process of imagining a future 
for yourself as though you or someone 

347
00:20:11,371 --> 00:20:12,204
you care about when you barely don't 
care about yourself or even hate 

348
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:15,960
yourself?
Yeah,

349
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,063
well I would say that
go through the exercise anyways and act 

350
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:27,360
as like try to extend to yourself some 
courtesy.

351
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,523
You know,
sometimes you have to act something out 

352
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:30,474
before you can start to believe it.
And so I would say sit down and pretend 

353
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,480
that you're your friend,
you know,

354
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,343
trade the probability that there's 
something so wrong with you that you 

355
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:47,650
don't deserve any regard whatsoever is 
zero,

356
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,180
you know,
so,

357
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:53,560
and I would say if,
if you just can't get it together,

358
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,543
you know,
maybe you were depressed and maybe you 

359
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:59,520
need to go talk to someone because you 
don't have to be depressed.

360
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,000
You talked to a physician,
you know,

361
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,013
there are treatments for depression if 
you happen to be depressed and if you 

362
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:05,794
actually hate yourself,
then it's a possibility that that's 

363
00:21:08,471 --> 00:21:10,300
what's going on.
I don't know how old you are,

364
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,673
but you know,
there are effective treatments for that 

365
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:14,284
sort of thing.
You might want to find out if there's 

366
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:18,790
actually something wrong physically or,
or psychophysiological.

367
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,151
He,
you know,

368
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:24,151
because you don't have to trudge through
life absolutely miserable.

369
00:21:24,641 --> 00:21:26,650
Their antidepressants,
for example,

370
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:30,250
work really well for some people.
Not for everyone but for some people.

371
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,180
So.
Okay.

372
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,520
Were the Nazis left wing?

373
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,330
Um,
that's a good question.

374
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,733
It depends.
See the problem with any question that 

375
00:21:45,421 --> 00:21:49,260
says is a,
B is a equivalent to be,

376
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,530
is that it depends on how you define a 
and B.

377
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:53,363
Right?
And I'm not trying to weasel out of the 

378
00:21:53,911 --> 00:21:54,570
question.
I'm,

379
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:58,020
I'm very,
very serious about that.

380
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,520
The Nazis regarded themselves as 
national socialists,

381
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:03,630
you know,
so they,

382
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,020
they,
they weren't free market capitalists,

383
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:07,854
let's say.
So they certainly weren't right wingers 

384
00:22:09,151 --> 00:22:11,910
in the way that free market capitalists 
are right wingers,

385
00:22:11,911 --> 00:22:13,950
even though they're probably more 
centrist,

386
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,263
um,
they differed from the international 

387
00:22:17,191 --> 00:22:18,024
socialists,
which were the Marxists because they 

388
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:23,850
were much more concerned with national 
identity and racial identity.

389
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:24,684
And to the degree that you regard 
nationalism and racial identity as 

390
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:32,400
primarily right wing views than the 
Nazis would have been right wing.

391
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:37,110
So let's say that they,
maybe they pulled from the worst of both

392
00:22:37,111 --> 00:22:38,730
extreme,
something like that.

393
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,563
But I do think it's reasonable to note 
that there extreme nationalism and 

394
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,124
ethnocentrism and racial identity 
probably has more in common with the 

395
00:22:47,341 --> 00:22:50,580
radical right than it does with the 
radical left,

396
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:55,581
which tends to be utopian universal.
So I'm one of the things I thought would

397
00:22:57,151 --> 00:23:02,130
be an interesting research project would
be to take like 100 Nazi policies and to

398
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:02,964
turn them into a questionnaire and asked
people either how much they agree with 

399
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:11,400
them after I figured out whether they 
were left to right wing to begin with or

400
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,353
whether they thought the policies were 
representative of the left or the right 

401
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,523
because that could be studied 
empirically and I don't think anyone's 

402
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:20,370
done it.
But that would be a very interesting,

403
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,233
uh,
that would be a very interesting 

404
00:23:22,561 --> 00:23:27,210
research project is left for Helgason 
probably Matt,

405
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,073
Matt massacred that name,
says who has a higher Iq at really 

406
00:23:32,281 --> 00:23:34,770
gifted mathematician or a really gifted 
painter.

407
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,650
Very difficult to say.
Um,

408
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:43,220
but I would say that gifted math,
because if they're both gifted,

409
00:23:43,261 --> 00:23:44,094
they both have high Iq.
So you can be certain that it's very 

410
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:48,950
difficult to do anything that's truly 
gifted,

411
00:23:48,951 --> 00:23:52,580
say above the average,
above the norm without being,

412
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,090
without having a very high Iq.
And in a creative realm.

413
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,193
I mean,
you hear about these idiot savant who 

414
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:03,371
have like one area of extreme expertise,
but generally in those cases it's not so

415
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:06,320
much that they have one area of extreme 
expertise,

416
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:07,154
it's that they have one area of above 
average expertise that really contrast 

417
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:11,954
with the rest of their impairments,
but they rarely if ever make it into 

418
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:15,800
the,
you know,

419
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,633
the very short list of true geniuses.
Mathematicians are kind of an odd bunch 

420
00:24:21,531 --> 00:24:24,020
though because you.
They peek really,

421
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:24,854
really early.
Like if you're going to be a 

422
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:26,534
mathematician and truly gifted,
then you're going to show signs of that 

423
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,410
when you're like 17 to 20,
something like that.

424
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,243
Whereas painters can,
can be creative through their entire 

425
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,230
lifespan.
I would say probably on average,

426
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,064
I would guess this is a guest that if 
you took 100 really gifted 

427
00:24:46,341 --> 00:24:48,620
mathematicians in 100 really gifted 
painters,

428
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:53,621
that the mathematicians would have far 
higher nonverbal Iq,

429
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,000
but the painter's might have higher 
verbal Iq.

430
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,190
So that also complicates things.
See with Iq also,

431
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:06,260
you know there's.
There's this factor called the g factor,

432
00:25:06,261 --> 00:25:07,094
which is the central element of 
intelligence and it seems to be 

433
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:11,354
associated with such things as head size
and brain size relative to body and 

434
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:18,380
neural conduction speed and simple 
reaction time,

435
00:25:18,381 --> 00:25:21,800
like really basic physiological markers,
um,

436
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,383
and it's a pretty tight single factors 
say as opposed to the personality 

437
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,710
dimension d domain where there's five 
quite clear factors,

438
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:36,130
but I think it was earl hunts research 
indicated that as people get smarter and

439
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:37,394
smarter,
the variability between the subsets of 

440
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:41,324
their intelligence starts to increase.
So it's sort of like there's a lot of 

441
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:44,594
ways to be really smart,
but there's only one way to be not very 

442
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:47,954
smart.
So that's another little tidbit of 

443
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:54,620
information with regards to ICU.
So

444
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:01,983
hello doctor,
I am a 23 year old male with paranoid 

445
00:26:04,121 --> 00:26:05,650
schizophrenia.
However,

446
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,320
I feel like controlling 95 percent of 
it.

447
00:26:08,321 --> 00:26:09,154
Okay.
So let's say I think you mean that 

448
00:26:10,031 --> 00:26:13,810
you're controlling 95 percent of it.
I decided to seek a partner,

449
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:18,100
but I am afraid how to reveal it.
Any advice on how to approach it?

450
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,930
Oh God.
Steven,

451
00:26:19,931 --> 00:26:21,400
that's a really hard question.

452
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,111
Well,
look,

453
00:26:25,111 --> 00:26:25,944
you're not under any obligation when you
first meet someone to drown them in 

454
00:26:30,781 --> 00:26:34,830
information about your identity.
So I would say

455
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,390
the devil's in the details.
Fundamentally,

456
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:40,523
if you have a relationship with someone 
and it's progressing and you're being 

457
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:45,504
honest,
my suspicions are that it will come up 

458
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:49,020
with its own accord.
You know,

459
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:49,854
that you'll be able to tell in this 
situation when the right way to 

460
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:55,200
introduce it is,
um,

461
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:55,920
you know,
if,

462
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,753
if you're asking me this because you've 
been in a relationship for a long time 

463
00:26:59,131 --> 00:27:03,570
and you haven't revealed it,
then I don't know what to tell you about

464
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:04,404
that because,
and because I wouldn't give someone 

465
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:08,580
general advice about that,
you know,

466
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,473
if,
uh,

467
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:13,683
sorry

468
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,960
if I,
if I,

469
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:18,400
we speaking to a client and I had some 
real

470
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,780
detailed information about their current
situation,

471
00:27:22,781 --> 00:27:25,450
I would sit down and help them 
strategize about that.

472
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,780
Ask about the person you're telling.
Figure out how long you've gone out with

473
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:29,614
them,
figure out a way that it might be 

474
00:27:31,061 --> 00:27:33,010
revealed that you would be comfortable 
with.

475
00:27:33,011 --> 00:27:33,844
I suspect probably what you should do is
find someone you trust to talk about it 

476
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,140
if you're already in a relationship and 
if you're not,

477
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:45,160
then assume that if going into the 
relationship,

478
00:27:45,161 --> 00:27:49,150
your basic goal is honesty,
that you'll handle it appropriately when

479
00:27:49,151 --> 00:27:51,370
the situation comes up.
So

480
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:00,763
how would you address accusations that 
you are creating another ideological 

481
00:28:03,861 --> 00:28:04,694
group identity which is equal in its 
capacity for destruction to post Modern 

482
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,860
Neo Marxism?
Well,

483
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,933
uh,
I would address it the way I've been 

484
00:28:12,201 --> 00:28:13,034
addressing it for the whole last year,
which is that I'm not trying to produce 

485
00:28:18,201 --> 00:28:19,034
a group identity of any sort.
I'm trying to get people to act locally 

486
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,463
in the confines of their own environment
and to sort things out that are under 

487
00:28:28,161 --> 00:28:30,140
their direct control.
So it's,

488
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,190
it's an elaboration of one of the ideas 
I suppose that's in the New Testament,

489
00:28:34,191 --> 00:28:35,024
which is that you should take the log 
out of your own eye before you worry 

490
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:39,860
about the dust speck in your neighbor's 
eye,

491
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,920
which I think is a really good general 
maxim.

492
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,760
And so there's nothing about that that's
associated with group identity.

493
00:28:46,761 --> 00:28:49,970
Now people have tried to,
um,

494
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,463
what would you call it,
attribute to me some identity with the 

495
00:28:55,851 --> 00:28:59,150
right or the alt right,
or even the far right more recently,

496
00:28:59,151 --> 00:28:59,984
even Hitler,
which is what came up in at Wilfrid 

497
00:29:02,301 --> 00:29:03,134
laurier.
But I think the reason for that is 

498
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,190
twofold.
One is,

499
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,233
look,
if you're imagine that there is a 

500
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,500
radical left that's not very difficult 
to imagine,

501
00:29:14,501 --> 00:29:15,334
and then imagine that everyone to the 
right of the radical left is our all in 

502
00:29:21,161 --> 00:29:21,994
opposition to the radical left.
So then you have a group and the group 

503
00:29:24,701 --> 00:29:25,534
is all those in opposition to the 
radical left and that'll include people 

504
00:29:29,471 --> 00:29:32,770
on the radical right.
And so then when you look at that entire

505
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,604
group,
so let's say a thousand people or 1500 

506
00:29:35,621 --> 00:29:36,454
people come in here,
a talk that I give on free speech that 

507
00:29:38,411 --> 00:29:40,960
happened on November 11th.
First of all,

508
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,913
there's 1500 people in a room,
like 15 of them are going to be 

509
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,440
completely out of their mind,
probably more like 30,

510
00:29:47,441 --> 00:29:50,200
but at least 15.
And that's just base rate.

511
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,370
And so to demonstrate that the group was
somehow pathological,

512
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:55,204
you'd have to show that the base rate of
pathology was higher in the group than 

513
00:29:57,701 --> 00:29:59,590
it would be in a randomly selected 
group.

514
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,573
And I've seen no evidence of that.
But also even if there are a number of 

515
00:30:04,211 --> 00:30:05,044
people say on the far right in that 
group that doesn't indicate at all that 

516
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:09,484
that's characteristic of the group.
But it's very hard to distinguish that 

517
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,144
because what tends to happen is that a 
group is defined by the most egregious 

518
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:20,350
behavior of,
of its most extreme members.

519
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,573
So anyways,
the other way that I did address the 

520
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:26,920
accusation is that,
and I have done this as well,

521
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:29,470
and I think it's what really protected 
me this whole year,

522
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:32,350
is that I have all these youtube videos 
online,

523
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,140
you know,
600 hours of them.

524
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:40,141
And the message is pretty stable.
The more the newer manifestation is,

525
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,063
you know,
a fairly focused critique of the 

526
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:48,910
university,
which I think is entirely justified.

527
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:49,744
But everything around that is focused on
the individual and the role of the 

528
00:30:54,581 --> 00:30:56,980
individual and the responsibility of the
individual.

529
00:30:56,981 --> 00:31:01,360
And so I don't believe that that is an 
ideological group identity,

530
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,600
so that's how I would address it.
So.

531
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,430
All right,
let's see what else we've got here.

532
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,950
What is the evolutionary reason for 
having consciousness?

533
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,920
I think that was toby who asked that

534
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,600
God only knows

535
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:42,230
that's been a problem that people have 
been hammering on for a long time.

536
00:31:42,231 --> 00:31:44,510
I mean,
that's the so called Zombie problem that

537
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:47,900
David Chalmers is as described,
which is something like,

538
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,543
how do you know that other people aren't
exactly like you except acting in a 

539
00:31:53,481 --> 00:31:56,130
completely determined manner and devoid 
of consciousness.

540
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,380
This,
um,

541
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,890
I don't know what the evolutionary 
reason is for consciousness.

542
00:32:00,891 --> 00:32:01,724
I mean,
I can speculate like what consciousness 

543
00:32:03,801 --> 00:32:05,420
seems to be,
at least in part,

544
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:10,010
is a,
a mechanism of repair.

545
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,270
So a lot of the things that you do are 
unconscious.

546
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,620
You know,
like when you're driving,

547
00:32:15,621 --> 00:32:18,120
if you're an expert driver,
you're,

548
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,073
you're using your eyes to watch the road
and your eyes are moving your hands and 

549
00:32:22,611 --> 00:32:23,444
your arms,
but you're not really thinking about 

550
00:32:26,331 --> 00:32:27,164
what you're doing.
You're not attending to it consciously 

551
00:32:28,431 --> 00:32:29,264
because you've built circuitry already,
specialized circuitry that handles all 

552
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:33,410
those tasks.

553
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:37,670
Now what happens when you're driving?
Let's say that you make a mistake.

554
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:38,923
Well then what happens?
You consciously attend to the mistake 

555
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,133
and you attempt to revise the part of 
the automatic structure that produced 

556
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:48,740
the error.
So let's imagine this.

557
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:49,574
Imagine you're playing the piano and 
you're playing a very complicated a 

558
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:53,863
sequence and you stumble over part of it
so you're zooming along and you stumble 

559
00:32:57,981 --> 00:33:00,010
over part of it and then you attend to 
that.

560
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:00,863
You'd go back and you slow down and you 
move your fingers slowly and you try to 

561
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:09,650
reprogram those little automatic units 
that have handled that part of that.

562
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,693
You repair them and,
and reprogram them and you get faster 

563
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,650
and faster out of it as they automatize 
and then you go.

564
00:33:15,651 --> 00:33:19,700
So consciousness seems to be something 
that watches what you do,

565
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:23,090
automatically checks for errors and then
repairs it.

566
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,280
And so that's its function.
Now you might ask why a repair mechanism

567
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:32,780
like that would have to be associated 
with awareness announced that is,

568
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,430
uh,
not only do I not know,

569
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:38,990
I don't think anyone knows if I was 
speculating and which I've done,

570
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:39,883
I think consciousness actually plays an 
integral role in being itself because 

571
00:33:43,491 --> 00:33:44,324
I'm not convinced that there would be 
any being of any recognizable sort 

572
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,153
without a conscious observer.
So I think consciousness is actually 

573
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:56,750
like a center point of the cosmos in 
some sense,

574
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,180
and I think it's because of ideas like 
that,

575
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,043
that the,
the grand archetypal idea of the soul 

576
00:34:03,111 --> 00:34:06,080
has emerged and I think it's correct.
So,

577
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:11,150
but how to precisely integrate that with
evolutionary theory.

578
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,583
Um,
apart from the description that already 

579
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:16,820
provided,
I just don't,

580
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,130
I just don't know.
So

581
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,970
let's see,
what else have we got here?

582
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,673
Would you consider a more official 
consultancy role with Andrew Scheer's 

583
00:34:29,711 --> 00:34:31,880
Conservative Party?
Um,

584
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,420
it's very difficult to say what I would 
consider.

585
00:34:34,421 --> 00:34:35,254
It isn't obvious to me that Andrew 
Scheer would particularly like to have 

586
00:34:39,431 --> 00:34:40,264
me as no official consultant time,
kind of what might you describe a 

587
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,940
controversial?
Yes,

588
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:48,250
that's the word right now.
And so,

589
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,300
you know,
it's funny though,

590
00:34:49,301 --> 00:34:51,670
because I was making this new video 
today,

591
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,120
which I alluded to earlier,
using good old.

592
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,290
What's this character here?
Uh,

593
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,270
Hitler though Hitler the spokes frog.
And uh,

594
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,810
I,
I went back and looked at my comments on

595
00:35:06,811 --> 00:35:08,970
bill [inaudible] last year,
which,

596
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,863
which were the comments that originally 
got me in hot water and had me accused 

597
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,570
of all the things I've been accused of 
Transphobia,

598
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,100
bigotry,
racism.

599
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:20,190
Um,
what else?

600
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,860
Oh,
you fascism being on the far right.

601
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,990
Then finally,
and to top it all off,

602
00:35:24,991 --> 00:35:25,824
Hitler himself.
And one of the things that I realized 

603
00:35:28,471 --> 00:35:29,304
was that,
that I was really calm during that 

604
00:35:31,321 --> 00:35:32,970
video.
You couldn't have really.

605
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,960
I couldn't have offered a more mild 
mannered criticism of bill [inaudible].

606
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,470
And it's pretty funny because,
you know,

607
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,423
I'm this scandal that engulfed Wilford 
laurier this week is the worst scandal 

608
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,650
that I remember involving university in,
in,

609
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,320
in my memory,
going back to the 19 seventies.

610
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,813
And what happened at Laurie was exactly 
what I predicted would happen except it 

611
00:35:57,991 --> 00:35:58,824
was actually worse because they did 
accuse Lindsay of breaking the law 

612
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,390
spill,
see 16 specifically,

613
00:36:06,391 --> 00:36:08,730
and have contravening the Ontario Human 
Rights Code,

614
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:09,720
which I,
you know,

615
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,430
for all I know she might've done.

616
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,773
So we're,
we're at this situation where a Ta 

617
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:17,634
showing a video of someone discussing 
pronouns in candidate can now be termed 

618
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,490
a hate crime and illegal provincially 
and federally.

619
00:36:26,491 --> 00:36:29,670
And like all the usual suspects have 
come out of their

620
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,790
caves,
let's say,

621
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,870
uh,
like Brenda Cossman,

622
00:36:34,871 --> 00:36:36,600
the lawyer I debated last year and said,
well,

623
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:40,530
it's a real stretch to assume that what 
Lindsay Shepherd did was,

624
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,453
was sufficiently reprehensible to 
actually constitute a violation of the 

625
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,830
Ontario Human Rights Commission.
A guidelines,

626
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,693
policies hits a stretch.
So I guess we're supposed to feel good 

627
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:55,110
about that.
But,

628
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,673
um,
I'm probably a little bit too hot right 

629
00:36:59,131 --> 00:37:02,700
now to serve in any official consultant 
role,

630
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,833
uh,
that doesn't mean that I wouldn't be 

631
00:37:06,901 --> 00:37:09,870
happy to speak to,
you know,

632
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,340
political figures who might be 
interested in speaking with me because,

633
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,010
you know,
I generally speak to people who asked me

634
00:37:17,011 --> 00:37:18,240
to speak to them.
So

635
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:20,843
as reprehensible as that might be,
recently moved up and was promoted and 

636
00:37:26,191 --> 00:37:28,710
not liking it because I have to adjust 
massively.

637
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,693
Is there a difference between liking 
your job and the lack of discipline to 

638
00:37:31,861 --> 00:37:33,240
perform a change?
Are there,

639
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,890
are they connected?
Yeah,

640
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:36,150
well,
they're definitely connected.

641
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,740
It's a tough one.
Um,

642
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:43,200
the first thing I would say is that if 
it was a real radical change,

643
00:37:43,201 --> 00:37:44,670
you know,
it takes people,

644
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:45,863
unless they're very young,
it takes people about a year to adjust 

645
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,410
to a really radical change,
like to move to a new city,

646
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,840
to,
to adjust to being married.

647
00:37:54,841 --> 00:37:59,250
That can take longer than a year to 
adjust to having a new baby to,

648
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:03,510
to getting over a relatively serious 
loss,

649
00:38:03,511 --> 00:38:06,450
like a death in the family a year,
you know.

650
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:10,320
And so the first thing you might ask 
yourself is,

651
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,170
are there things that are good about the
promotion?

652
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,153
The second is,
do you have the capacity to do the job 

653
00:38:18,091 --> 00:38:19,290
or to learn how to do it?

654
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,123
You could talk to someone about that.
And then the third thing is have you 

655
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:23,994
given yourself enough time to adjust 
because one of the things I often 

656
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:27,594
recommend to people when they've made a 
radical change like going leaving home 

657
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,224
and going to university,
is don't pay any attention to how you 

658
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:37,750
feel for a year because everything is so
much up in the air that you can't really

659
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:38,584
trust your own judgment.
So you have to give yourself time to 

660
00:38:41,591 --> 00:38:45,580
adapt and you can't expect that that's 
going to happen overnight.

661
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,870
It,
it's certainly not.

662
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:47,704
And to put that expectation on yourself 
increases the probability that you're 

663
00:38:50,351 --> 00:38:52,630
going to feel bad about it.
So,

664
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,300
um,
let's see.

665
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:01,210
Atomic Carlos says,
my Iq is north of one slash 30.

666
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:03,400
Yet I questioned my own intelligence all
the time.

667
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:04,234
I feel big cognitive dissonance between 
what people expect of me and what I 

668
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:10,210
considered myself capable to do.
Well,

669
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,860
you know,
Carlos would,

670
00:39:11,861 --> 00:39:14,950
I would recommend there is that if,
if you haven't done it,

671
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:15,784
just go do the personality test and 
understand myself.com because what 

672
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:19,774
you're describing sounds very much like 
high levels of negative emotionality or 

673
00:39:24,371 --> 00:39:28,690
neuroticism and you might want to find 
out if that's the case because if you're

674
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,583
much higher than average in neuroticism,
then you're going to be questioning 

675
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:36,730
yourself all the time and you might want
to figure out if that's actually a trait

676
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,013
and if it is a trait,
well then that gives you an explanation 

677
00:39:40,091 --> 00:39:40,924
of it.
And then you might also note that your 

678
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:47,500
levels of negative emotion are not well 
matched to your likely skill.

679
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,340
Now that doesn't necessarily help you 
learn to cope with it,

680
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:52,174
but sometimes identifying the reason 
it's useful and there's another 

681
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:55,954
possibility too,
is that your mood is dysregulated and 

682
00:39:57,881 --> 00:40:00,700
that you're depressed.
So that's another thing to consider.

683
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,980
Um,
if you,

684
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,130
if you do find that you have high levels
of neuroticism but you're not depressed,

685
00:40:07,131 --> 00:40:10,690
then one of the things you might do is 
write down all the reasons,

686
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:12,340
like really think them out.
You know,

687
00:40:12,341 --> 00:40:14,620
I mean,
really get serious about this,

688
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,693
write down all the reasons why you might
give yourself more credit for 

689
00:40:18,701 --> 00:40:19,534
intelligence than you have,
and part of that could be like a really 

690
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:23,794
deep reconsideration of successes you've
had in the past with complex 

691
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,383
intellectual issues because imagine that
you are serving as your own defense 

692
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,930
attorney against a very critical part of
your mind.

693
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,150
Um,
that can help a lot.

694
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,940
That can help.
Marlene hibbs says,

695
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:42,010
my little girl loves you.
Uh,

696
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,630
well that's,
that's good.

697
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:48,750
I guess you can say hi to her for me.
I hope that she has a great little life.

698
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,443
So give her a pat on the head and tell 
him that cognizant of the modern art 

699
00:40:59,831 --> 00:41:02,080
scene.
So

700
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,520
it isn't easy to figure out how to,
how to answer that question.

701
00:41:07,521 --> 00:41:08,500
So,
um,

702
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,063
I haven't been thinking also about art 
for quite a long time because I've been 

703
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:18,000
so engaged in all this political and 
philosophical materials.

704
00:41:18,001 --> 00:41:19,570
So,
but music,

705
00:41:19,571 --> 00:41:20,404
as far as music goes,
I really liked the last recordings of 

706
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:27,481
Johnny cash.
Who else springs to mind?

707
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:35,070
I like a very large variety of a lot of 
different genres of music as well,

708
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:39,830
so
I'll have to leave it at that.

709
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:40,664
I think

710
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,210
Richard Boyle says,
hi,

711
00:41:46,211 --> 00:41:47,044
Dr Peterson,
how does the score of 91 for compassion 

712
00:41:49,781 --> 00:41:53,080
and one for politeness equals a score of
35 for agreeableness?

713
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,183
Yeah,
well it's because 91 in one aren't 

714
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:57,723
ordinary numbers.
Their percentiles and you can't just 

715
00:41:59,861 --> 00:42:02,470
average percentiles.
It doesn't work that way.

716
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:06,430
What it says is that,
let's see,

717
00:42:06,431 --> 00:42:07,264
I don't know if I can generate it,
just a description on the fly because 

718
00:42:09,731 --> 00:42:10,564
I'm not,
I wouldn't say I'm particularly 

719
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,113
mathematically gifted,
although I know that the answer I just 

720
00:42:14,831 --> 00:42:17,200
gave you is correct.
Let's see.

721
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:21,910
There's one in,
there's a one in 10 chance that a person

722
00:42:21,911 --> 00:42:22,744
would be that compassionate and a one in
100 percent chance that a person would 

723
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,700
be that,
that,

724
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,580
that uh,
nope,

725
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,100
I can't generate it on the fly,
but that's the answer.

726
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:36,820
So if you want to point to the proper 
literature,

727
00:42:36,821 --> 00:42:37,690
you'd look up,

728
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:41,350
I'm,
uh,

729
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,710
how to transform percentiles into CSI 
scores.

730
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,320
They were called CSI scores.
Then you can,

731
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,490
if you,
oh,

732
00:42:48,491 --> 00:42:51,190
that's how it works.
You convert the percentiles in disease,

733
00:42:51,191 --> 00:42:53,590
scores,
you some disease scores,

734
00:42:53,591 --> 00:42:55,600
and then you reconvert them into 
percentiles,

735
00:42:55,601 --> 00:42:56,434
and so if you take the z score for not 
for compassion 91 and the z score for 

736
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:02,800
politeness one,
add them,

737
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:05,200
divide them into and reconvert them to a
percentile,

738
00:43:05,201 --> 00:43:06,910
you'll get 35.
I know it's weird,

739
00:43:06,911 --> 00:43:08,140
but that's,
that's how it,

740
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:11,560
that's how it is.
That's how it's done.

741
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,653
So

742
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,040
let's see.
The opioid crisis.

743
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:26,171
This is army hat or hateful.
The opioid crisis in my community in the

744
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:27,584
midwest of America greatly bothers me.
I've been thinking about becoming a 

745
00:43:31,371 --> 00:43:32,204
police officer.
The culture has been very favorable 

746
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,473
towards cops lately.
Maybe maybe majoring in law in Grad 

747
00:43:38,391 --> 00:43:41,000
school instead.
Advice,

748
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:42,050
please.
Thanks.

749
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,353
Well,
if you're,

750
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,120
if you're going to be a police officer,
you should be very emotionally stable,

751
00:43:49,121 --> 00:43:51,970
so low in neuroticism and very high in 
conscientiousness.

752
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:54,910
If you're going to be a lawyer,

753
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,060
you better be very bright.
First,

754
00:43:58,061 --> 00:44:01,960
you need to be extremely bright verbally
in particular.

755
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,153
You need to be extremely conscientious.
You need to be emotionally stable and 

756
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,840
you need to be fairly disagreeable.
That's,

757
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:08,703
that's what characterizes lawyers.
If you're high in openness and 

758
00:44:12,101 --> 00:44:13,270
creativity,
let's say.

759
00:44:13,271 --> 00:44:17,770
I would say neither nor law is a good 
occupation for you.

760
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:23,250
So I wouldn't worry about the culture 
not being too favorable towards cops.

761
00:44:24,731 --> 00:44:27,130
That's,
I don't think it's really any worse than

762
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:27,964
it was.
It's probably not as bad as it was in 

763
00:44:29,631 --> 00:44:33,150
the sixties and I don't that it will 
necessarily continue.

764
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:36,830
I don't think you should let that stop 
you because you know,

765
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:37,943
the police have their own brotherhood 
and you'd find your community within 

766
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:41,490
that.
Um,

767
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,613
you what I would say you should think 
more about what you want then how other 

768
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:50,210
people view the occupation.
I know that's irrelevant,

769
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,990
but you should think about what you 
want.

770
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:52,823
And I think if see if you can figure out
if the life of a policeman would 

771
00:44:56,941 --> 00:44:59,010
actually interest you or the life of a 
lawyer.

772
00:44:59,011 --> 00:45:01,080
Like lots of people go into law and 
don't like it.

773
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:01,943
You have to be argumentative.
You have to really be literate because 

774
00:45:05,641 --> 00:45:08,670
there's so much reading and writing.
You have to be able to write,

775
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,710
you have to be able to lay out clear 
arguments,

776
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:11,783
you have to be really orderly and detail
oriented because there's so many things 

777
00:45:15,031 --> 00:45:16,690
to keep track of.
Um,

778
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:18,263
so you've got to make sure you got the 
right temperament for that so you could 

779
00:45:20,701 --> 00:45:24,870
try the big five personality scale at 
understand myself.

780
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,190
I'm,
like I said,

781
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,530
the good lawyers are high in 
conscientiousness,

782
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:32,580
low in neuroticism,
pretty disagreeable,

783
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:33,833
and then extroversion helps to some 
degree because it makes you better in 

784
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:40,920
the court and it also makes you better 
at generating sales leads,

785
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:42,930
which you know,
growing your business,

786
00:45:42,931 --> 00:45:44,850
which is super important if you're a 
lawyer,

787
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:47,340
like lots of people are competent 
lawyers,

788
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:48,174
but only a small set of competent 
lawyers are also good at generating new 

789
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:55,410
business.
And that makes you extremely valuable.

790
00:45:55,411 --> 00:45:59,070
So if you've got a salesmen aspect to 
you as well as those other traits,

791
00:45:59,071 --> 00:45:59,904
which makes you a pretty rare person,
then you know you could be a bang up 

792
00:46:01,831 --> 00:46:03,090
lawyer.
So

793
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,070
link with a light saber,
says,

794
00:46:10,071 --> 00:46:11,180
hey man,
as a Canadian,

795
00:46:11,181 --> 00:46:12,014
I just wanted to say thanks candidate 
short on heroes these days and I'm glad 

796
00:46:14,991 --> 00:46:17,060
to see you filled that role.
Thanks again bud.

797
00:46:17,061 --> 00:46:18,530
Hey,
well thanks a lot man.

798
00:46:18,531 --> 00:46:20,540
I don't really think of myself as a 
hero.

799
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:21,374
I think of myself as someone who's on a 
relatively small raft perched on a 

800
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:27,074
relatively large wave paddling like a 
mad dog and trying not to be submerged 

801
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,130
so and so far.
Well,

802
00:46:34,131 --> 00:46:37,100
I haven't drawn yet,
so hooray for that.

803
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,080
So,
hey guys,

804
00:46:39,081 --> 00:46:41,690
I'm going to read you a little bit of my
book if you don't mind,

805
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,560
somewhere near the end of this.
Uh,

806
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:46,100
let's see.
I'll probably go for about two hours.

807
00:46:46,101 --> 00:46:46,934
So we got about another hour,
so I figured I'd read something to you 

808
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:51,710
for about 15 minutes and if you're 
interested in that,

809
00:46:51,711 --> 00:46:54,530
why don't you just say so in the 
comments section,

810
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,393
that would be good.
Then I could see what people think of 

811
00:46:56,961 --> 00:46:57,794
that idea.

812
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:01,310
Um,
let's see here.

813
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,173
Sorry,
it's taken me just a little while to 

814
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,470
good.
Someone says,

815
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,160
well,
I'll,

816
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:11,801
I'll,
I'll,

817
00:47:11,801 --> 00:47:12,634
uh,
go for that.

818
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:14,123
Let's see.

819
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:16,923
Hi Jordan.
What are feelings and why do we have 

820
00:47:18,851 --> 00:47:20,620
them?
Well,

821
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,270
here's a way of thinking about it.
So look,

822
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:27,250
let's say you were walking down a 
pathway.

823
00:47:27,251 --> 00:47:29,650
I actually saw this happen one day,
so I'll you this story.

824
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:34,570
So I was walking along the cliffs near,
I think it was San Diego La,

825
00:47:34,571 --> 00:47:38,250
I don't remember.
I think probably,

826
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,840
I think it was,
I think it was San Diego.

827
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:42,123
Anyways,
I was walking along there with some 

828
00:47:43,031 --> 00:47:47,200
friends and a and a brother of a friend 
of mine who was quite a tall guy.

829
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:49,360
He's about six foot five,
something like that.

830
00:47:49,361 --> 00:47:51,820
And he was walking along the path on the
edge of the cliff,

831
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:56,850
kind of sandy and with with scrub pine 
around overlooking the Pacific Ocean.

832
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:01,000
And it was march I think,
so it was warm but not too warm.

833
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,130
We were walking along and all of a 
sudden,

834
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,250
his little girl who I think was like 
four or five,

835
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:08,973
she was walking in front of him and in 
front of me and I guess we were going 

836
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:12,634
round a little bit of a corner and all 
of a sudden she jumped right up on his 

837
00:48:15,461 --> 00:48:18,340
shoulders,
which I'd never seen a child do that.

838
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,510
It was like watching,
you know,

839
00:48:19,511 --> 00:48:20,344
if you,
if a cat sleep and you and you and you 

840
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:27,271
go out and it'll jump up and puff out 
its hair and can jump straight up.

841
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:31,450
Well that's what this kid did and there 
was a rattlesnake at the side of the,

842
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:33,580
of the path.
Now it was cold,

843
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,520
which was probably good,
but you know,

844
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,960
there's a guy named,
uh

845
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:41,950
Oh,
I can't read.

846
00:48:41,951 --> 00:48:44,650
He wrote a great book on fear.
It'll come to me.

847
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:45,484
It'll come to me.
It's a book that I should have on my 

848
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:51,391
booklist actually.
And he showed that there are circuits in

849
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:53,134
your brain there reflects circuit.
So this had been demonstrated to some 

850
00:48:56,261 --> 00:49:00,580
degree much earlier that map.
So imagine that a snake is a pattern.

851
00:49:00,581 --> 00:49:01,414
And then imagine that there's a pattern 
on your retina that constitutes the 

852
00:49:04,151 --> 00:49:04,984
snake,
and then imagine that that can be 

853
00:49:06,371 --> 00:49:10,300
transformed into another pattern which 
is a muscular output pattern.

854
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,870
And that muscular output pattern is to 
jump you in the air,

855
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:14,704
so your eyes make your,
your make your muscles move in a 

856
00:49:19,601 --> 00:49:24,130
particular way that happens before you 
see the snake and before you're afraid.

857
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,233
And the reason for that is that so it's,
there are not many neural connections 

858
00:49:28,061 --> 00:49:30,850
between snake detection and leaping in 
the air.

859
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:36,240
And that's because if you waited to feel
fear and waited to see the snake,

860
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:39,070
that would take between a quarter and 
half a second,

861
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,904
something like that,
and the snake would have already bitten 

862
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:42,874
you.
So unless you had those really short 

863
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:44,914
neuropathways that have been conserved 
in the evolutionary process since like 

864
00:49:48,911 --> 00:49:49,744
the beginning of time,
anything super fast and simple would be 

865
00:49:52,751 --> 00:49:55,390
able to kill you.
So now,

866
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:58,750
so let's say that you do encounter 
something unexpected.

867
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,800
Well first you have these bodily 
reflexes that are really fast.

868
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,140
And then the next thing that happens,
generally speaking,

869
00:50:05,141 --> 00:50:07,870
is that you feel an emotion.
Like maybe you're frozen,

870
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:08,704
so if you hear a real girl behind you,
you'll freeze and then you'll feel fear 

871
00:50:12,131 --> 00:50:16,090
and that'll keep you frozen.
And so the fear is,

872
00:50:16,091 --> 00:50:16,924
uh,
an indication of that physiological 

873
00:50:19,031 --> 00:50:19,864
state.
And then only after that will you start 

874
00:50:22,241 --> 00:50:23,074
to think and strategize.
And so you need reactions at multiple 

875
00:50:27,351 --> 00:50:30,950
levels of temporal resolution in order 
to keep you safe in the world.

876
00:50:30,951 --> 00:50:33,500
And the fast reactions are muscular and 
reflexive.

877
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:35,330
And then the next ones generally 
speaking,

878
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,390
are something like emotions and they're 
low resolution,

879
00:50:38,391 --> 00:50:39,410
but quick,
you know,

880
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:43,310
like if you're afraid it means there's 
something that may be dangerous.

881
00:50:43,311 --> 00:50:45,990
It's vague and it's not until you 
explore it,

882
00:50:45,991 --> 00:50:47,600
that you know exactly what the danger 
is.

883
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:50,180
But the fear is a good enough initial 
category.

884
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:55,190
So you could think about feelings as 
instinctual categories,

885
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:57,290
things to love,
things to eat,

886
00:50:57,410 --> 00:50:58,243
things to run away from,
things to run towards their low 

887
00:51:01,011 --> 00:51:01,844
resolution categories.
And that's how animals categories the 

888
00:51:04,581 --> 00:51:05,414
world.
They use emotion and motivation to 

889
00:51:06,411 --> 00:51:07,244
categorize the world.
So we have to keep ourselves properly 

890
00:51:10,581 --> 00:51:14,210
oriented in the world and to react 
quickly and so that we can stay alive.

891
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:15,463
So.

892
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,660
Okay,
let's see here.

893
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:25,050
What else have we got?
Recently?

894
00:51:25,141 --> 00:51:28,850
I took a job working at a camp with at 
risk boys were.

895
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,860
Well there I will live at work as a 
counselor and a house with the kids.

896
00:51:31,861 --> 00:51:34,950
Any advice for working with young people
with behavioral issues?

897
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,860
Uh,
yeah.

898
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,660
It depends on what the behavioral issues
are.

899
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,110
So I don't know what our risk means,
but uh,

900
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,003
so I can't be too specific,
but what I can tell you is that almost 

901
00:51:50,391 --> 00:51:52,340
nothing beats listening,
you know,

902
00:51:52,341 --> 00:51:55,730
like take a kid for a walk,
let them talk,

903
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,500
like listen to them,
ask them questions,

904
00:51:57,501 --> 00:51:58,334
you know,
because most disturbed people and maybe 

905
00:52:01,311 --> 00:52:06,311
even most people don't actually have 
anyone they can talk to and they need to

906
00:52:06,471 --> 00:52:11,120
talk first of all to find out that 
someone actually cares enough to listen.

907
00:52:11,121 --> 00:52:11,954
So it's sort of like a validation of the
fact that they exist and second so that 

908
00:52:15,351 --> 00:52:19,280
they can sort out their own thoughts.
So as a beginning counselor,

909
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,210
the best thing you can do is listen,
you don't want to give advice really,

910
00:52:23,211 --> 00:52:24,470
you know,
because what you want,

911
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,340
you can ask questions that might lead 
someone in an advisable direction.

912
00:52:28,341 --> 00:52:29,174
But the problem with giving advice is 
that people are much more likely to 

913
00:52:32,661 --> 00:52:33,494
remember something and to implement it 
if they've thought it up in their own 

914
00:52:36,411 --> 00:52:38,660
words.
I think that actually produces a kind of

915
00:52:38,661 --> 00:52:39,494
neurological transformation.
The idea has to be engendered from 

916
00:52:42,261 --> 00:52:44,420
within.
It's one of the prime dicta of,

917
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:46,640
of psychoanalytic theory,
for example.

918
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:49,820
And I think it's a really good one.
So yeah.

919
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:50,750
With,
with regards to.

920
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:53,210
So Brendan Crystal says trippy snakes 
and retinas.

921
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:54,920
Yeah.
Like it's really specific.

922
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,830
So this woman named um,

923
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,410
no,
I probably can't remember her name.

924
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:01,900
Me It either.
She,

925
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,240
she wrote a book about trees and 
serpents.

926
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,520
Uh,
she's a ucla professor.

927
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,200
Um,
the fruit,

928
00:53:08,201 --> 00:53:10,090
the tree and the serpent,
I think it's called.

929
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:11,283
She showed quite clearly that not only 
do our retinas say directly detects 

930
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:15,424
snakes,
but they do a better job in the bottom 

931
00:53:16,811 --> 00:53:17,644
half of the retina and that we're really
good at detecting the camouflage 

932
00:53:22,001 --> 00:53:23,860
patterns that are characteristic of 
snakes.

933
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,400
Snakes have these like patterns which 
are very,

934
00:53:26,401 --> 00:53:30,270
very rare and we have specialized 
circuitry for detecting those.

935
00:53:30,271 --> 00:53:35,271
And there is recent research conducted 
that showed that children six months old

936
00:53:35,341 --> 00:53:38,160
who had never been exposed to anything 
even resembling a snake,

937
00:53:38,161 --> 00:53:42,210
had an automatic response to snakes.
And so it actually seems to be innate,

938
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,010
not just,
uh,

939
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:47,940
not just easily learned.
So that's really quite interesting.

940
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:53,360
So.
Okay,

941
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:03,570
let's go back to the pigeon hole thing 
here.

942
00:54:03,571 --> 00:54:06,780
How do you clean your room when your 
spouse doesn't share that goal?

943
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,233
Huh?

944
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,160
Well,
that's another one of those questions.

945
00:54:14,161 --> 00:54:16,710
It's really hard to answer because I 
don't have the details,

946
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,660
you know,
how do you clean your room?

947
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,860
What goals does your spouse have?
That's the first thing.

948
00:54:22,861 --> 00:54:25,920
I mean,
is there some commonality?

949
00:54:25,921 --> 00:54:28,050
I mean,
it might be maybe you're exposed as much

950
00:54:28,051 --> 00:54:28,884
more disorderly than you or less 
conscientious or irritated at you for 

951
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,830
all sorts of reasons.
You know,

952
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:34,973
the first thing you could do is
try to lead by example and see how that 

953
00:54:40,021 --> 00:54:40,854
works,
but you may have to argue and fight it 

954
00:54:42,631 --> 00:54:43,371
out,
you know,

955
00:54:43,371 --> 00:54:45,870
um,
break it down into sub tasks and,

956
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:51,180
and see if you can distribute the tasks 
and negotiate.

957
00:54:51,181 --> 00:54:55,770
You have to negotiate.
And without further information,

958
00:54:55,771 --> 00:54:57,330
I can't say much more than that,
you know,

959
00:54:57,331 --> 00:54:58,164
you can say why you're doing it,
what you think the goal we're and goal 

960
00:55:00,811 --> 00:55:01,644
was and that you'd like some help and 
maybe there's something you could offer 

961
00:55:03,751 --> 00:55:04,584
in return.

962
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:05,563
Um,
if you can't negotiate at all with your 

963
00:55:07,231 --> 00:55:08,064
spouse,
then you have a much broader problem 

964
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,014
than how do you clean your room when you
were supposed doesn't share that goal 

965
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:16,410
because the real problem would be how do
you learn to negotiate with your spouse?

966
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,660
I could talk about that a little bit.
I mean,

967
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:22,530
the first thing that you have to do,
if you want to negotiate with someone is

968
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,210
be able to say no.
The second thing is to have something to

969
00:55:27,211 --> 00:55:31,260
offer.
The third thing is to find out what they

970
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,910
want and to know what you want.
You know,

971
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:37,200
because often people,
especially with people that love them,

972
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:37,681
they say,
well,

973
00:55:37,681 --> 00:55:39,840
if you really knew,
if you really love me,

974
00:55:39,841 --> 00:55:41,520
then you'd know what I want.
It's like,

975
00:55:41,521 --> 00:55:42,750
no,
that's just wrong.

976
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:43,703
The person that you are in love with or 
that living with isn't any smarter than 

977
00:55:46,651 --> 00:55:47,250
you.

978
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,083
And so you pretty much always have to 
tell people straight out what you want 

979
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:51,803
and then you have to let them be really 
stupid about giving it to you for quite 

980
00:55:54,361 --> 00:55:55,020
a while.
You know?

981
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:55,853
So sometimes I've recommended to my 
clients that they take their wife or 

982
00:55:59,941 --> 00:56:00,774
husband out on a date and of course 
they're all skeptical about that and 

983
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,380
cynical about it.
And uh,

984
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,473
then they go on a date and they have a 
terrible time and they come back and 

985
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:08,910
say,
oh,

986
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:11,580
I told you that was a stupid idea.
And I tell them,

987
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:12,743
that's it then a,
you're not gonna do anything romantic 

988
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:17,610
with your spouse for the next 40 years.
That's your plan.

989
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:18,444
That's the plan is that it's like you 
might have to go out to a movie after 

990
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:25,960
you haven't been good to each other for 
like five years.

991
00:56:25,961 --> 00:56:29,050
You might have to go out to movie 10 
times movie and dinner,

992
00:56:29,051 --> 00:56:31,480
say before it starts to become fun 
again.

993
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,940
It's like it's hard to do that sort of 
thing,

994
00:56:33,941 --> 00:56:35,470
right?
You don't.

995
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,750
People think those things are easy and 
they're not.

996
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:41,200
So anyways,
you have to.

997
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,270
You have to learn to negotiate with your
spouse.

998
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,373
And that's a very difficult thing to do.
So I'm figuring out what you want is a 

999
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:54,010
good way to start.
So.

1000
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,233
Oh,
okay.

1001
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,280
What advice would you give the parent of
an only child?

1002
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,440
Well,
I'll make sure that the child,

1003
00:57:07,441 --> 00:57:11,160
your child has lots of time for free 
play with other kids.

1004
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:14,790
And by free play,
I mean play with no electronic gadgets,

1005
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:19,791
not sitting in front of the TV.
The kids have to be able to learn how to

1006
00:57:20,431 --> 00:57:25,200
amuse themselves and to especially to 
engage in pretend play,

1007
00:57:25,201 --> 00:57:26,034
say if they're between three and 
probably 11 damn near that time with 

1008
00:57:30,931 --> 00:57:31,764
other kids is extremely important and 
kids don't get enough time for free 

1009
00:57:34,891 --> 00:57:35,724
play.
So that's what I would say is get them 

1010
00:57:37,051 --> 00:57:37,884
around other kids as much as you can and
not under situations where the parents 

1011
00:57:42,691 --> 00:57:43,524
are going to just sit them in front of 
the TV or something like that to amuse 

1012
00:57:45,781 --> 00:57:46,614
them so they don't make too much noise.
It's not like there's anything wrong 

1013
00:57:49,321 --> 00:57:50,970
with seeing them and letting them watch 
a movie,

1014
00:57:50,971 --> 00:57:53,370
but there's nothing wrong with the 
movie.

1015
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:57,630
But there is something wrong with not 
giving the kids enough time to engage in

1016
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,120
spontaneous play.
It's a catastrophe.

1017
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:05,330
So how has the GRANDPA and going?
I think it's going pretty well.

1018
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:09,450
It's quite a lot of fun to have a little
baby around again.

1019
00:58:09,451 --> 00:58:14,451
I mean I think like most man,
I'm somewhat nonplussed,

1020
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,340
let's say by infants.
Um,

1021
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,980
it's easier for me to deal with kids 
after they were about,

1022
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:22,073
once they get mobile la,
once I can sort of throw them around a 

1023
00:58:24,241 --> 00:58:27,510
bit more than I know what to do with 
them once I can play with them,

1024
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:31,710
but it's really fun to watch my daughter
be a mother.

1025
00:58:31,711 --> 00:58:32,544
She's really good at it and it's good to
have another young thing in the family 

1026
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:40,140
and you know,
because babies are very,

1027
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,200
they're kind of like fire you,
you can't help but watch them and

1028
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:49,290
it's great.
It's great and she seems healthy and um,

1029
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:55,090
she's cute as can be.
Of course babies are sneaky that way,

1030
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,040
but it's working.
So yeah,

1031
00:58:57,041 --> 00:59:00,100
I think it's really going well.
So

1032
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:06,340
I constantly cannot verbalize my 
thoughts written and focal regardless of

1033
00:59:06,341 --> 00:59:07,174
topic and my level of knowledge.
Tips for verbalizing thoughts to get 

1034
00:59:10,121 --> 00:59:13,420
them into writing and therefore speech.
Well,

1035
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:17,590
what I would say lauren is do this like 
read something,

1036
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,833
put a decide,
try to summarize it in writing and talk 

1037
00:59:24,051 --> 00:59:24,884
while you're doing it.
And then write down what you say and 

1038
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,940
don't edit while you're doing that.
See,

1039
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:31,760
one of the problems that people have 
when they're trying to write,

1040
00:59:31,761 --> 00:59:34,780
as they try to write a good sentence,
they,

1041
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:35,713
they not only tried to write a sentence,
but they try to write a good sentence 

1042
00:59:37,971 --> 00:59:40,730
and you can't do that.
You have to write a sentence that's hard

1043
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:42,920
enough and then you have to edit it.

1044
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:47,920
So allow yourself to write badly.
I'm dead serious about this,

1045
00:59:48,021 --> 00:59:49,430
like write a bad,
bad,

1046
00:59:49,431 --> 00:59:54,350
bad first draft and then edit it if you 
get rid of 70 percent of it.

1047
00:59:54,351 --> 00:59:56,570
So what?
That's exactly what should happen.

1048
00:59:56,571 --> 00:59:58,760
So like if you want to write a thousand 
word essay,

1049
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,833
you should start by writing a really bad
2000 word essay and then you should get 

1050
01:00:03,921 --> 01:00:06,680
rid of the worst 50 percent.
You can do that iteratively.

1051
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,320
I have a document online.
It's,

1052
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:11,210
it's.
If you go to my website,

1053
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:15,800
I'm under courses,
there's psychology for 30 is the course.

1054
01:00:15,801 --> 01:00:19,460
I should make this more public,
but under a cycle psychology for 30.

1055
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:24,380
There's a template for writing and if 
you went looked at that template,

1056
01:00:24,381 --> 01:00:26,740
it tells you it answers your question.
I,

1057
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,793
I produced this little guidebook for,
for writing that will help and if you 

1058
01:00:32,721 --> 01:00:36,200
write enough,
you'll learn to speak.

1059
01:00:36,201 --> 01:00:37,034
The other thing I would say too is that 
it might be anxiety that's do you might 

1060
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:41,504
think about joining a club like 
toastmasters or maybe if you're a 

1061
01:00:44,811 --> 01:00:47,420
university student to public speaking,
uh,

1062
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:48,553
something where you'd get in front of 
people and then when you're in front of 

1063
01:00:50,991 --> 01:00:52,400
people,
don't talk to the group,

1064
01:00:52,401 --> 01:00:56,600
talked to the individuals within the 
group and let yourself be bad at it.

1065
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:57,463
You'll get better as you practice.
What is your plan if Youtube deletes 

1066
01:01:02,031 --> 01:01:02,864
your account?

1067
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:06,163
Alright.
Cause as much trouble as I possibly 

1068
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:10,170
could.
And um,

1069
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:14,360
I don't think they will.
I do have it.

1070
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:17,930
I do have most of my videos on Vimeo,
I think I haven't had,

1071
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:18,943
I did try to do that.
I set up an automated service to 

1072
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:23,990
duplicate them.
I've never checked to see if it worked,

1073
01:01:23,991 --> 01:01:27,260
which is probably stupid,
but I've been so overwhelmed with,

1074
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:34,490
with this,
with,

1075
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:39,860
with this surreal position that I found 
myself in that I haven't been able to be

1076
01:01:39,861 --> 01:01:42,230
sufficiently diligent.
So,

1077
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:43,123
um,

1078
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:48,830
how to be less afraid of death.
I have a better suggestion.

1079
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:51,770
You should be more afraid of not living 
properly.

1080
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,060
I don't know if you can be less afraid 
of death.

1081
01:01:56,061 --> 01:01:59,870
Exactly.
But I think that here's a hypothesis,

1082
01:01:59,871 --> 01:02:03,470
and this is a socratic hypothesis.
I write about this in my book too,

1083
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,960
by the way.
Um,

1084
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,620
maybe if you live your life thoroughly,
thoroughly,

1085
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:10,483
right?
You take use of the advantage is make 

1086
01:02:12,051 --> 01:02:14,060
use of the advantages that are put in 
front of you.

1087
01:02:14,061 --> 01:02:16,790
Make use of your talents.
Say Yes to things.

1088
01:02:16,791 --> 01:02:19,950
Tell the truth like stand and get out 
it.

1089
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:23,250
I'm assuming that you can do that,
you know,

1090
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:25,740
because some people are very ill and,
and hurt.

1091
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:26,853
But assuming you can do that,
I think the only way to combat fear of 

1092
01:02:30,601 --> 01:02:31,434
death is to live fully.
And I think that that might actually 

1093
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:35,130
work.

1094
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:35,963
I kind of wonder,
I've talked about this with my father 

1095
01:02:37,801 --> 01:02:38,970
too.
He was getting pretty old.

1096
01:02:38,971 --> 01:02:40,170
You know,
I've asked him if,

1097
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:41,453
for example,
if he could be transformed back into an 

1098
01:02:43,561 --> 01:02:45,720
18 year old,
knowing what he knows now,

1099
01:02:45,721 --> 01:02:48,570
would he do it?
And he was ambivalent about that,

1100
01:02:48,571 --> 01:02:49,500
you know,
he didn't say no,

1101
01:02:49,501 --> 01:02:50,334
but he didn't say yes.
And we talked about this idea that if 

1102
01:02:54,031 --> 01:02:56,910
you lived your life fully,
you know,

1103
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,060
maybe that would be good enough because,
you know,

1104
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:00,963
I loved having kids,
but I don't feel that I would have kids 

1105
01:03:05,881 --> 01:03:07,030
again,
you know,

1106
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:10,200
because in some sense I've already done 
that.

1107
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:11,633
And so maybe there's a set number of 
adventures that you have to go on in 

1108
01:03:16,411 --> 01:03:18,570
your life.
Let's say you have to be married,

1109
01:03:18,571 --> 01:03:20,250
you have to have kids,
you have to have a career,

1110
01:03:20,251 --> 01:03:21,084
you have to have friends,
you have to have something useful to do 

1111
01:03:24,061 --> 01:03:27,510
with your time outside of work.
Those are all things that are covered in

1112
01:03:27,511 --> 01:03:29,100
the future authoring program.
By the way,

1113
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:31,560
maybe if you do all those,
it's like,

1114
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:33,450
that's good enough.
You've had your life.

1115
01:03:33,451 --> 01:03:34,950
And,
and that's enough.

1116
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:36,030
I mean,
I don't know,

1117
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:38,810
10 years ago I thought,
you know,

1118
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:40,650
if I could extend my life radically,

1119
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:47,190
then I would.
And I'm not so sure about that.

1120
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:48,960
Now that I'm,
I'm 55,

1121
01:03:48,961 --> 01:03:49,890
you know,
I'm getting older.

1122
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:56,580
I kind of have a suspicion that you 
might come to an end,

1123
01:03:56,581 --> 01:03:58,980
you know,
that's what it looks like.

1124
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:01,320
I mean,
I don't want that to be sued,

1125
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:06,350
but
maybe you exhaust yourself in your life,

1126
01:04:06,351 --> 01:04:07,184
you know,
maybe you can so that there's nothing 

1127
01:04:08,181 --> 01:04:13,181
left of view really.
It's a good goal anyways.

1128
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,690
So.
Okay,

1129
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:18,940
let's find out.
Let's go back to this other

1130
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:21,323
Dr Peterson.
I have an interview for medicine coming 

1131
01:04:23,641 --> 01:04:27,180
up very soon.
It's structured in the I format and it's

1132
01:04:27,181 --> 01:04:28,014
intensely competitive.
Any tips on how to stand out from the 

1133
01:04:30,421 --> 01:04:35,310
rest?
Well,

1134
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:36,980
the only thing I can say is that

1135
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:39,773
two things.
One is really pay attention to the 

1136
01:04:42,181 --> 01:04:43,200
interviewers,
right?

1137
01:04:43,201 --> 01:04:44,034
Super attention,
like don't glare at them like you're 

1138
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:46,973
aggressively paranoid,
but like make sure you're focused on 

1139
01:04:49,951 --> 01:04:50,784
them.
And then the other thing I would say is 

1140
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:56,370
say what you really think,
like tell the truth.

1141
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:58,770
It'll make you,
first of all,

1142
01:04:58,771 --> 01:05:00,360
if you tell the truth and it doesn't 
work,

1143
01:05:00,361 --> 01:05:04,170
then you know,
maybe that's not the school for you.

1144
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:06,590
That's something to really think about.
Um,

1145
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:09,030
and if it doesn't work anywhere and you 
tell the truth,

1146
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:09,864
maybe medicine isn't for you,
and I know that might be a terrible 

1147
01:05:11,611 --> 01:05:12,444
shock,
but let's assume that you are genuinely 

1148
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:20,470
properly motivated to study medicine.
Then tell them what you think.

1149
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:23,560
You know so many people when they go 
into an interview,

1150
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:26,320
try and they do this when they write 
essays too,

1151
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:29,650
is try to tell the interviewers what you
think they want to hear it,

1152
01:05:29,651 --> 01:05:30,484
but you can bloody well be sure that 
virtually everybody who's being 

1153
01:05:32,321 --> 01:05:33,700
interviewed is going to do that.

1154
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,553
And I don't think that's very advisable 
because if you don't manifest yourself 

1155
01:05:40,091 --> 01:05:43,840
the way you are,
then there's no way that the path that's

1156
01:05:43,841 --> 01:05:47,650
proper for you can reveal itself.
I know that sounds sort of mystical,

1157
01:05:47,651 --> 01:05:49,210
but I don't know how to put it any 
better.

1158
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,033
The best way to stand out in an 
interview always assuming you're 

1159
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:56,620
competent and that you've done the 
preparation,

1160
01:05:56,621 --> 01:06:01,060
you know and that you're not living a 
lie is to actually say what you think.

1161
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:02,613
And hopefully what will happen is that 
there will be other people on the panel 

1162
01:06:06,641 --> 01:06:07,290
that's,
that's,

1163
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:08,123
that are looking at you,
who are of the same type and that would 

1164
01:06:12,011 --> 01:06:14,560
characterize a good position for you,
a good place to be.

1165
01:06:14,561 --> 01:06:15,394
If there are people like that and 
they'll know what you're doing and that 

1166
01:06:17,981 --> 01:06:21,070
will that,
then they'll think you know that person,

1167
01:06:21,071 --> 01:06:23,440
you know they're there,
they'd be good.

1168
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,150
There are straightforward,
they're honest,

1169
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,470
they're,
they're tough.

1170
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,630
They're,
they can say what they think.

1171
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:31,120
And if there aren't people like that on 
the panel,

1172
01:06:31,121 --> 01:06:33,430
then I would say you probably don't want
to go there anyways.

1173
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:36,520
So that's what I would.
That's what I would do.

1174
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,040
Be True to yourself,
you know,

1175
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:39,993
but that also assumes that you've done 
your homework and that you're prepared 

1176
01:06:43,241 --> 01:06:44,074
and all of that.
Because if you're useless jackass and 

1177
01:06:46,091 --> 01:06:48,640
you're yourself,
obviously that is going to work.

1178
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:52,330
So good luck.
Good luck with your interview.

1179
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:53,673
But I always think that like you,
the other thing too is don't treat the 

1180
01:06:57,011 --> 01:06:59,680
interviewers as enemies.
You know,

1181
01:06:59,681 --> 01:07:00,514
if that's hard because if you're kind of
petrified about the potential outcome 

1182
01:07:04,181 --> 01:07:05,014
and you feel intense judgment,
then you're likely to go in there and 

1183
01:07:08,051 --> 01:07:12,430
kind of afraid and nervous and and and 
maybe even resentful.

1184
01:07:12,431 --> 01:07:13,264
It's like

1185
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:18,250
you've already done enough so that 
you're going to get interviewed.

1186
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:23,340
So in some sense the interviewers are 
hoping that you'll be great already.

1187
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:24,963
You know,
there might be the odd cynic in there 

1188
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:26,584
who's trying to figure out a reason to 
give you an x and and check you off the 

1189
01:07:29,711 --> 01:07:32,830
list,
but most of the people sitting there,

1190
01:07:32,831 --> 01:07:33,664
if they have a clue,
are going to be looking for good 

1191
01:07:35,441 --> 01:07:37,870
candidates and they're going to assume 
that you're.

1192
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:41,860
You've hit threshold and so it's not 
like they're not on your side.

1193
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:43,780
And so that's a good thing to keep in 
mind too.

1194
01:07:43,781 --> 01:07:47,230
You're not going in there to,
to face a panel of enemies,

1195
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:51,880
you're going in there to face a panel of
the sort of people that you're likely to

1196
01:07:51,881 --> 01:07:52,714
be in 10 years.
So that's another thing that's really 

1197
01:07:54,611 --> 01:07:56,860
useful to keep in mind with interviews 
in general.

1198
01:07:56,861 --> 01:07:58,360
I would say so.

1199
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,450
Okay.
Many of my friends seeing the wonders of

1200
01:08:03,451 --> 01:08:04,284
diversity,
I try to tell them diversity isn't a 

1201
01:08:06,151 --> 01:08:06,984
moral good,
but I ended up looking like some 

1202
01:08:09,181 --> 01:08:11,520
terrible racist.
Why isn't diversity a moral good?

1203
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:13,410
Well,
diversity is a moral good,

1204
01:08:13,411 --> 01:08:14,244
but you can't.
Diversity by race doesn't produce 

1205
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:18,520
diversity.
That's,

1206
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:22,790
that's called racism.
That idea or diversity of gender doesn't

1207
01:08:22,791 --> 01:08:25,370
produce diversity unless that's how you 
define diversity.

1208
01:08:25,371 --> 01:08:26,204
Look,
let's say that you get diversity partly 

1209
01:08:29,901 --> 01:08:33,890
as a consequence of personality,
which is a good way of looking at it.

1210
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:39,200
There is more diversity within groups of
people then between,

1211
01:08:39,201 --> 01:08:42,560
so like men and women differ to some 
degree in their personalities,

1212
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:43,513
but there's far more difference between 
men within the male group and women 

1213
01:08:47,361 --> 01:08:48,194
within the male group than there is 
between the average or typical male and 

1214
01:08:51,021 --> 01:08:53,630
female.
So it's a stupid wait.

1215
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:54,523
Let's assume that what you want the 
organization is pursuing your complex 

1216
01:08:58,761 --> 01:09:03,620
goal and you want a variety of skills 
that would be suited to that goal.

1217
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:08,780
Then you want there to be enough 
diversity of ability within the group so

1218
01:09:08,781 --> 01:09:12,500
that the goal can be achieved in a 
efficient and,

1219
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:15,560
and uh,
and inexpensive manner,

1220
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,180
right?
Because what do you want?

1221
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,920
Inefficient and expensive,
obviously not.

1222
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:23,203
So there's a presumption that you get 
diversity by using identity politics 

1223
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:29,084
categories,
but there's absolutely no evidence for 

1224
01:09:30,621 --> 01:09:31,454
that whatsoever.
So that's why diversity defined by race 

1225
01:09:37,161 --> 01:09:41,120
or ethnicity or gender is not only not a
moral good,

1226
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:41,983
it's actually a moral evil because it 
dispenses with the whole idea of the 

1227
01:09:45,921 --> 01:09:48,500
individual dispenses,
with the idea of competence.

1228
01:09:48,501 --> 01:09:49,334
It just replaces it with the assumption 
that if you randomly select from the 

1229
01:09:52,761 --> 01:09:53,594
population,
because that's how you would get real 

1230
01:09:55,341 --> 01:09:56,174
equity,
you randomly select from the population 

1231
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,310
that that gives you the best qualified 
group of people.

1232
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:02,293
Well that's just that.
You wouldn't do that to select the 

1233
01:10:04,581 --> 01:10:05,414
plumber.
It's the stupidest possible way of 

1234
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:10,310
selecting for anything randomly,
you know,

1235
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:14,330
there's no difference between selecting 
randomly and selecting accidentally.

1236
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:19,750
So it's moral diversity defined properly
is a moral good.

1237
01:10:20,511 --> 01:10:22,730
Diversity based on identity politics.

1238
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:25,490
Categories is a positive evil,
you know,

1239
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:26,683
true to our.
Our prime minister's great example of 

1240
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:30,650
that,
so back,

1241
01:10:30,651 --> 01:10:31,484
I think it was in 2015,
he announced that half of his cabinet 

1242
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:35,624
was going to be women because it was 
2015 or some like muddle headed virtue 

1243
01:10:39,891 --> 01:10:43,880
signaling,
signaling excuse for not thinking.

1244
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:48,660
I think only 20 percent or 25 percent of
the elected mps were female.

1245
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:52,880
So the proper balance on average would 
it be 25 percent female,

1246
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:53,714
75 percent male.
What he should've done was figured out 

1247
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:57,763
who,
what qualities would make for a 

1248
01:10:59,661 --> 01:11:00,494
competent cabinet minister because it's 
actually quite important to have 

1249
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:03,884
competent cabinet ministers and then 
selected from among his people for 

1250
01:11:08,121 --> 01:11:08,954
nothing other than competence,
but he could virtue signal and then he 

1251
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:14,340
set up the most important board,
let's say,

1252
01:11:14,341 --> 01:11:18,480
of the entire comp country on a random 
basis.

1253
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:20,370
Jesus,
how pathetic.

1254
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:23,970
He should've been pilloried by Canadians
for that.

1255
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:25,103
But we're so clued out and also in this 
situation that you described is like if 

1256
01:11:29,611 --> 01:11:30,151
I say,
well,

1257
01:11:30,151 --> 01:11:33,060
50 percent of Trudeau's cabinet 
shouldn't have been women.

1258
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:34,111
It's like,
oh,

1259
01:11:34,111 --> 01:11:35,550
you're a misogynist.
It's like,

1260
01:11:35,551 --> 01:11:38,760
no,
only 25 percent of the elected officials

1261
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,110
were women.
Now you might say,

1262
01:11:40,111 --> 01:11:40,944
well,
it would be better if 50 percent of the 

1263
01:11:42,211 --> 01:11:44,730
were elected.
It's like maybe it would be better,

1264
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,940
but it didn't happen,
so you can't.

1265
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:51,690
You can't fix it at the top end.
It was appalling.

1266
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:52,913
So it's a hard argument to make because 
you need to know that there's more 

1267
01:11:57,721 --> 01:12:01,140
difference within groups then between 
them in order to be able to come up with

1268
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:03,030
a credible argument,
you know,

1269
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:06,690
and then so yeah.
Yeah.

1270
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:08,813
How does one distinguish a statement 
coming from oneself rather than from 

1271
01:12:11,551 --> 01:12:12,390
ideology?
Hey,

1272
01:12:12,391 --> 01:12:13,224
I got a good hint about that.
If you're saying something that almost 

1273
01:12:17,131 --> 01:12:21,930
anyone else could say,
then it's likely to be either cliched or

1274
01:12:21,931 --> 01:12:22,830
ideological.

1275
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:26,010
Where as if you're speaking from 
yourself,

1276
01:12:26,011 --> 01:12:29,850
then in some sense you're the only 
person who could be saying that,

1277
01:12:29,851 --> 01:12:33,480
and so what that means in some senses 
that you've taken ideas,

1278
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:35,370
philosophical,
even in theological,

1279
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,473
and you've made them personal so that 
you're speaking from a position that 

1280
01:12:40,681 --> 01:12:41,514
only you can speak from,
and then then you have something 

1281
01:12:43,231 --> 01:12:47,460
original to offer in Solzhenitsyn's 
Gulag archipelago.

1282
01:12:47,461 --> 01:12:48,294
He talked about the like radical 
communists who were thrown into the 

1283
01:12:50,791 --> 01:12:53,820
Gulag and they used to play comrade with
them.

1284
01:12:53,821 --> 01:12:56,700
It was a game.
And what they would do is bait them into

1285
01:12:56,701 --> 01:13:01,050
making continual propagandistic 
communists statements.

1286
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:04,380
It was an attempt to try to educate them
out of their possession,

1287
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:05,843
but it's a good.
See if you can predict what someone is 

1288
01:13:08,071 --> 01:13:11,310
going to say on the basis of their set 
of beliefs,

1289
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:14,640
then they're not speaking.
The ideology is speaking.

1290
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,100
And if the ideology is speaking,
you don't even have to listen to them.

1291
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:20,610
You could just read about the ideology 
and make up your own mind now.

1292
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,200
So that's,
that's sort of the,

1293
01:13:22,201 --> 01:13:23,640
um,
what would you call it?

1294
01:13:23,641 --> 01:13:24,474
That's the objective view of this.
The subject of view is that statements 

1295
01:13:29,731 --> 01:13:31,920
come from yourself that come from 
yourself.

1296
01:13:31,921 --> 01:13:32,754
I think first of all,
frightened you to some degree because 

1297
01:13:34,111 --> 01:13:37,740
you actually open yourself up to the 
world by saying something genuine,

1298
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:39,083
but they also make you stronger.
They make you feel stronger put because 

1299
01:13:43,531 --> 01:13:45,870
I think you're confronting your 
vulnerability properly,

1300
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,393
you know,
because if I tell you something that I 

1301
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:51,570
really don't believe and you criticize,
it's like who cares?

1302
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,790
Because I don't really believe,
believe it anyways,

1303
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:57,300
so maybe I have an ideology that's like 
a mask or a persona,

1304
01:13:57,301 --> 01:13:58,134
which is generally the case personas,
a youngin concept that means mask and 

1305
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,310
it's often the thing that people confuse
with their real identity.

1306
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:06,503
Well,
if I have a persona and someone 

1307
01:14:07,201 --> 01:14:08,400
criticizes it,
it's like,

1308
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:10,080
well,
you haven't got to the real meat,

1309
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:11,423
but if I say something that I really 
believe deeply believe and then it gets 

1310
01:14:15,131 --> 01:14:17,470
criticized like I've really put myself 
on the line,

1311
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,260
and so people don't do that.
It's kind of frightening,

1312
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:21,123
but it's.
It's still the way to genuine strength 

1313
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:24,543
because you need.
And also not just strength but also 

1314
01:14:27,251 --> 01:14:28,084
value.
You need to manifest yourself in the 

1315
01:14:29,741 --> 01:14:30,574
world because you're a unique thing and 
people bite need what's unique about 

1316
01:14:36,611 --> 01:14:38,440
you?
Everybody else might really need that.

1317
01:14:38,441 --> 01:14:39,274
I believe that you don't because each 
person has something that's unique to 

1318
01:14:42,701 --> 01:14:43,534
them to bring into being and if they 
hide that they hide their light under a 

1319
01:14:47,891 --> 01:14:48,724
Bushel,
that everyone is poorer for it and you 

1320
01:14:51,341 --> 01:14:54,130
do that in part as social units and says
by turning in,

1321
01:14:54,131 --> 01:14:57,910
you're turning over your God given sole 
to human dogma.

1322
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,880
It's a very bad idea.
Very bad idea.

1323
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:05,320
So okay,
let's see what else we've got here.

1324
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:08,320
What time is it?
Two 21.

1325
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:16,620
Someone said,
daddy read for us.

1326
01:15:16,621 --> 01:15:17,820
Yeah,
no problem man.

1327
01:15:17,821 --> 01:15:18,654
I'm going to do it.

1328
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:36,243
David Maxwell.
I scored the zero percentile for 

1329
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:40,720
conscientiousness and the 84th for 
neuroticism.

1330
01:15:40,721 --> 01:15:42,130
How do I improve these scores?
Well,

1331
01:15:42,131 --> 01:15:42,964
okay,
so the first thing David you might want 

1332
01:15:44,171 --> 01:15:47,230
to think about is like if all of your 
scores were low,

1333
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:50,410
then there's some possibility that 
you're being too hard on yourself.

1334
01:15:50,411 --> 01:15:51,244
And what I would recommend Danny's,
get a couple of friends to fill out the 

1335
01:15:54,821 --> 01:15:59,620
questionnaire for,
for you to describe you and then see if,

1336
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:01,170
first of all,
if there's any agreement,

1337
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:02,023
see if they've,
they are easier on you than you are 

1338
01:16:03,611 --> 01:16:05,020
yourself.
So,

1339
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:08,740
but let's assume that you are rather low
in conscientiousness.

1340
01:16:08,741 --> 01:16:09,850
The next question would be,
well,

1341
01:16:09,851 --> 01:16:10,684
how young are you?
Because younger people tend to be 

1342
01:16:12,221 --> 01:16:14,650
lowered conscientiousness.
So if you're like 16,

1343
01:16:14,651 --> 01:16:17,410
well that's low,
but it's not catastrophic.

1344
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:20,680
If you're 40 and you're not depressed 
and zero is,

1345
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:21,640
you know,
that's low

1346
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:24,123
anyways.

1347
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,650
If you are that low in 
conscientiousness,

1348
01:16:26,651 --> 01:16:29,740
one of the things I would recommend is 
a,

1349
01:16:29,741 --> 01:16:30,574
make a plan and be learn how to use a 
schedule a calendar and do it badly to 

1350
01:16:34,871 --> 01:16:36,460
begin with,
like electronic calendar,

1351
01:16:36,461 --> 01:16:37,294
like Google calendar.
That's the best thing I know of to 

1352
01:16:39,131 --> 01:16:42,850
improve conscientious,
make a plan so that you've got something

1353
01:16:42,851 --> 01:16:47,851
to aim at and um,
use a scheduler and maybe you have to,

1354
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,353
you know,
talk to someone to help keep you on 

1355
01:16:51,371 --> 01:16:52,204
track.
Now the other question would be do you 

1356
01:16:54,251 --> 01:16:56,710
have other personality traits that are 
really high,

1357
01:16:56,711 --> 01:16:57,544
like openness,
because if you're really high in 

1358
01:16:58,781 --> 01:16:59,614
openness,
then it might be that you're more 

1359
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:06,070
inclined towards being motivated by 
spontaneous interest and in the artistic

1360
01:17:06,071 --> 01:17:08,170
direction and if you're really high in 
extroversion,

1361
01:17:08,171 --> 01:17:10,310
then you could be motivated by being 
around people.

1362
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:14,870
So it also may be that in order to be 
conscientious about something,

1363
01:17:14,871 --> 01:17:15,704
you have to pick a domain that you're 
suited to like socializing or artistic 

1364
01:17:19,281 --> 01:17:23,240
endeavor and try to work on being 
conscientious in those domains.

1365
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:26,750
So that's it.
So

1366
01:17:30,290 --> 01:17:31,123
James Montgomery says,
how can you be confident and courageous 

1367
01:17:33,771 --> 01:17:36,560
if your father was emotionally absent 
and narcissistic?

1368
01:17:36,561 --> 01:17:37,394
I'm 21 and very creative.
My mother is a people pleaser who isn't 

1369
01:17:39,651 --> 01:17:43,030
confident in herself and uses me as 
emotional support.

1370
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:47,473
Help.

1371
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:56,241
Well,
look,

1372
01:17:56,241 --> 01:17:59,330
you're confident about some things.
You said you were very creative.

1373
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:06,980
So you're confident enough to say that.
And you know

1374
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:17,680
I don't see the problem with questions 
like this.

1375
01:18:17,681 --> 01:18:19,360
I'm not criticizing your question by the
way,

1376
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:24,361
is that you're linking your lack of 
confidence and courage to the absence of

1377
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:25,324
your father and his narcissism and also 
associating it with your mother being a 

1378
01:18:28,841 --> 01:18:30,490
people pleaser.
So,

1379
01:18:30,491 --> 01:18:32,680
and you know,
there may be something to that.

1380
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:36,800
It could be James,
that you could,

1381
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:42,100
could stand to talk to somebody you know
for awhile on a regular basis and see if

1382
01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:46,270
they can help you sort this out.
You obviously seem to think that this is

1383
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:49,030
a problem with you moving forward in 
your life.

1384
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:51,850
If you don't want to talk to someone 
about it,

1385
01:18:51,851 --> 01:18:55,090
then I would say the other thing,
you need a plan.

1386
01:18:55,150 --> 01:18:56,440
I knew that.
I always refer to that,

1387
01:18:56,441 --> 01:18:57,274
but it's the case.
You need a plan and then you need to 

1388
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:01,083
break the plan down into this,
into small steps that are somewhat 

1389
01:19:04,151 --> 01:19:08,560
challenging that you have a high 
probability of nonetheless obtaining.

1390
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:13,830
And then I would say by observing 
yourself move forward properly that your

1391
01:19:13,901 --> 01:19:16,120
confidence will increase.
You're only 21,

1392
01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:17,890
you know,
so you're not that old.

1393
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:19,810
But,
um,

1394
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:21,333
that's the best I can do without having 
more information about the specifics of 

1395
01:19:24,971 --> 01:19:25,840
your situation.

1396
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:54,790
Can't increase your Iq in any 
significant way.

1397
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,230
Eat healthy,
do the right thing.

1398
01:19:56,231 --> 01:19:57,160
Best potential.
Well,

1399
01:19:57,161 --> 01:20:00,520
one of the things you could do if not to
increase it,

1400
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:05,350
is at least to maintain it,
is that because your Iq tends to decline

1401
01:20:05,351 --> 01:20:07,090
as you age.
It's quite depressing.

1402
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:09,030
You read the relevant literature,
uh,

1403
01:20:09,031 --> 01:20:09,864
your crystallized Iq,
which is an indication of your 

1404
01:20:11,881 --> 01:20:14,440
accumulated knowledge doesn't decline 
in.

1405
01:20:14,441 --> 01:20:16,080
Sometimes it even increases,
you know,

1406
01:20:16,081 --> 01:20:17,730
unless you get dementia or something 
like that.

1407
01:20:17,731 --> 01:20:20,640
But your fluid Iq,
which is more like the program or of the

1408
01:20:20,641 --> 01:20:21,474
brain declines a lot.
The best way to deal with that is to 

1409
01:20:24,181 --> 01:20:29,181
exercise both aerobic and weight lifting
can really stave off cognitive decline.

1410
01:20:31,441 --> 01:20:34,160
And that's because your brain is a very 
car.

1411
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:35,153
It's very demanding.
It has a very demanding set of 

1412
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,473
cardiovascular requirements.
And so if your cardiovascular system is 

1413
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:45,270
in good shape,
then your brain is healthier.

1414
01:20:45,271 --> 01:20:47,250
And since,
at least in principle,

1415
01:20:47,251 --> 01:20:48,084
your Iq depends on your brain than 
having a healthy brain is really a good 

1416
01:20:51,091 --> 01:20:52,470
idea.
So

1417
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:12,920
Jerry Newton says,
I often don't do very well,

1418
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:13,813
don't very well and doubt my ability to 
stand up for myself and discussions and 

1419
01:21:16,461 --> 01:21:18,380
aggressive situations.
Hi.

1420
01:21:18,381 --> 01:21:20,570
Do I know when I've incorporated my 
shadow?

1421
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,380
I guess I would say,
Jerry,

1422
01:21:31,381 --> 01:21:33,120
that practice makes perfect.
You know,

1423
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:37,980
one thing you could do is start keeping 
track of situations like that.

1424
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:38,833
You know,
where you you walk away thinking that 

1425
01:21:41,671 --> 01:21:42,504
you should have said something and so 
then I would say write down the 

1426
01:21:45,421 --> 01:21:46,254
situation and then think through and 
write down what you think you should 

1427
01:21:50,401 --> 01:21:51,234
have done and that because that's going 
to help you be sharper on the draw and 

1428
01:21:55,021 --> 01:21:59,430
more ready when and then so.
So write down the situation,

1429
01:21:59,730 --> 01:22:01,620
write down what you think you should 
have done.

1430
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:06,030
Then sit and imagine the situation as 
vividly as you can,

1431
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:06,893
right?
Get the pictures in your head and 

1432
01:22:08,071 --> 01:22:08,904
imagine yourself doing that and,
and try to get the psychophysiological 

1433
01:22:12,631 --> 01:22:13,464
response is up as well so that you make 
it as realistic as possible and that 

1434
01:22:16,861 --> 01:22:20,280
will actually help you practice.
So Edna Foa,

1435
01:22:20,281 --> 01:22:22,080
who,
who's a very good clinical psychologist,

1436
01:22:22,081 --> 01:22:25,830
has demonstrated quite clearly that when
treating post traumatic stress disorder,

1437
01:22:25,831 --> 01:22:26,664
for example,
if you get people to sit and imagined 

1438
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:30,503
being back in this stressful situation,
they have to do that voluntarily and 

1439
01:22:33,061 --> 01:22:33,894
after at least 18 months after the 
trauma had that she did 

1440
01:22:37,141 --> 01:22:37,974
psychophysiological recording of heart 
rate and skin conductance and that kind 

1441
01:22:40,651 --> 01:22:41,250
of thing.

1442
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:42,083
She showed that the people who showed 
the highest levels of stress reactivity 

1443
01:22:46,201 --> 01:22:49,380
to the reimagining were the ones who got
better,

1444
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:52,200
fastest,
and stayed better longest.

1445
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:56,520
So you have a situation that you know 
you haven't mastered,

1446
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:01,350
define the situation repeatedly.
Define your proper action repeatedly.

1447
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:04,170
Practice implementing that in your 
imagination,

1448
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:06,340
and then start,
do that in your real life.

1449
01:23:06,341 --> 01:23:07,800
And that'll,
that'll,

1450
01:23:07,801 --> 01:23:10,180
uh,
see if you write down what you should've

1451
01:23:10,181 --> 01:23:12,010
said.
You'll find out what you really want and

1452
01:23:12,011 --> 01:23:13,600
what you really think.
And that's,

1453
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:15,890
that'll be your shadow talking it,
dude.

1454
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:17,103
That's the best way to think about it.
Is that the part of your brain that 

1455
01:23:19,901 --> 01:23:20,734
wishes it would have done something 
different is the shadow associated with 

1456
01:23:24,551 --> 01:23:25,384
the aggression.
Who's integration would strengthen your 

1457
01:23:27,821 --> 01:23:28,990
character?
That's,

1458
01:23:29,060 --> 01:23:31,630
that's a very good way of,
of thinking about it.

1459
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:36,900
So
Matt says,

1460
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:39,741
Oh,
this is an.

1461
01:23:39,741 --> 01:23:40,840
Okay.
Oh,

1462
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:41,713
Matt says I need to ask you something.
Can you please release your new book as 

1463
01:23:44,331 --> 01:23:49,331
an audiobook as well in your own voice?
Yes,

1464
01:23:49,701 --> 01:23:52,040
I'm doing that.
I'm starting to record it on Monday.

1465
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:52,933
Um,
I'm kind of surprised that people want 

1466
01:23:55,071 --> 01:23:58,790
me to record it in my own voice,
which is kind of scratchy at the moment,

1467
01:23:59,690 --> 01:24:00,523
but I'm looking forward to it.
I've been practicing reading it with my 

1468
01:24:02,811 --> 01:24:05,060
wife,
puts her to sleep at night.

1469
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,130
Hopefully that's not because of the 
book.

1470
01:24:07,131 --> 01:24:10,690
She does get quite tired at night.
So I'm.

1471
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:13,700
Let's see here.

1472
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:19,390
Would you ever consider having a 
dialogue with legitimate Muslim scholar?

1473
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:20,480
Yes,
absolutely.

1474
01:24:20,481 --> 01:24:23,530
And I know a number of them and I'm 
hoping that I'll get to that.

1475
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:26,530
Uh,
it's a big thing to take on,

1476
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:27,453
you know,
and I'm trying to deal with this 

1477
01:24:28,871 --> 01:24:29,704
biblical lecture series and with,
well all the other things that I'm 

1478
01:24:32,111 --> 01:24:35,440
involved in,
including starting to lay the groundwork

1479
01:24:35,441 --> 01:24:37,510
for this online university,
which is which,

1480
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:38,373
and I've started looking for an office 
where a team could work on that and 

1481
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:42,833
we've sketched out some of the ideas.
We're gonna use competitive writing 

1482
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:49,960
exercises to help teach people to write,
which I think would really be fun.

1483
01:24:49,961 --> 01:24:52,110
So one idea is,
um,

1484
01:24:53,470 --> 01:24:54,303
so imagine,
remember this is just the outline of 

1485
01:24:56,381 --> 01:24:57,214
idea.
Imagine we present you with a paragraph 

1486
01:24:58,451 --> 01:24:59,284
that someone else wrote and then you 
have the opportunity to do a better job 

1487
01:25:02,711 --> 01:25:06,130
of writing it and then people get the 
opportunity to vote on who's is better.

1488
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:07,323
You could see that the paragraphs could 
compete and that you could get a 

1489
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,860
academic points based on the quality of 
your writing.

1490
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:13,840
Um,
anyways,

1491
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:16,630
uh,
that's all to say,

1492
01:25:16,631 --> 01:25:17,464
especially also with this book coming 
out is that I'm going to be very 

1493
01:25:19,661 --> 01:25:20,494
occupied and I want to start a dialogue 
with legitimate Muslim scholars because 

1494
01:25:29,471 --> 01:25:31,270
I would also like to learn more about 
Islam.

1495
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:34,930
So hopefully that'll happen in the,
uh,

1496
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:37,870
in the relatively near future.
So

1497
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:57,410
Jake says,
I've been incredibly inspired by you.

1498
01:25:57,411 --> 01:26:00,410
Love what you do and would like to 
enlightened people in a similar manner,

1499
01:26:00,710 --> 01:26:05,480
be careful what you wish for it is,
is appropriate to aim to have as much as

1500
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:08,470
an impact as you or more so.
Um,

1501
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:14,870
I think it's the idea formulated wrong 
in some sense.

1502
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:17,890
I think,
I mean,

1503
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:22,390
it's good to have people that you 
admire,

1504
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:27,420
let's say who can serve as models and 
I'm not claiming that I'm necessarily in

1505
01:26:29,591 --> 01:26:31,720
that category,
but it's good to have people like that.

1506
01:26:31,721 --> 01:26:35,110
But what you want to figure out to do,
to do,

1507
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:39,280
to do is how to manifest the ideal 
within the confines of your own life,

1508
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:40,233
right?
Because you're a particular sort of 

1509
01:26:41,141 --> 01:26:45,550
person and so the way that you're going 
to live your life best,

1510
01:26:45,551 --> 01:26:50,551
it's very unlikely that it would be 
associated in any important way with the

1511
01:26:50,681 --> 01:26:51,514
way that I've chosen to live my life 
unless we have very similar 

1512
01:26:53,831 --> 01:26:55,300
temperaments,
which is possible,

1513
01:26:55,301 --> 01:26:57,430
but you know,
relatively unlikely

1514
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:01,000
because the odds against that are,
you know,

1515
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:02,180
extraordinarily high.

1516
01:27:04,990 --> 01:27:07,950
The odds of any two people having the 
same temperament are very,

1517
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:13,230
are very high.
So what you can do is aim to,

1518
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:14,933
to Orient yourself towards high good 
that you can conceive up to discipline 

1519
01:27:18,481 --> 01:27:20,430
yourself to tell the truth and all of 
that.

1520
01:27:20,431 --> 01:27:23,250
And then what I would say is that as 
your life unfolds,

1521
01:27:23,251 --> 01:27:25,950
you'll have the amount of influence that
you should have.

1522
01:27:26,190 --> 01:27:28,350
Whatever that happens to be.
You know,

1523
01:27:28,351 --> 01:27:32,970
some people live pretty local lives.
Like my life for example,

1524
01:27:32,971 --> 01:27:33,804
is much more public than my wife's life.
But that doesn't mean that her 

1525
01:27:38,041 --> 01:27:40,350
contribution is somehow lesser.
I mean,

1526
01:27:40,351 --> 01:27:42,540
she's been unbelievably good with our 
kids.

1527
01:27:42,541 --> 01:27:43,374
My daughter was very ill and my wife was
extraordinarily good with her and was a 

1528
01:27:46,771 --> 01:27:51,210
great mother and has been a tremendous 
help to me as a very honest person and a

1529
01:27:51,211 --> 01:27:54,450
wise person and you know,
that all has an impact.

1530
01:27:54,450 --> 01:27:55,283
It's just not as obvious because while 
the kids really love her and now she's 

1531
01:27:57,961 --> 01:27:58,794
got grandkids and God only knows what 
the consequences of that is going to be 

1532
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:05,240
across successive generations and you 
know,

1533
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:09,980
she isn't interested in public life.
I'm a journalist too vast to interviewer

1534
01:28:09,990 --> 01:28:12,240
like quite recently about what the last 
year has been.

1535
01:28:12,290 --> 01:28:17,290
Liking her preferences to not do that 
and that's fine.

1536
01:28:17,851 --> 01:28:18,684
Like she has her own destiny and her own
way of being in the world and there's 

1537
01:28:22,410 --> 01:28:26,130
nothing to say that it's lesser in any 
sense of the word at all.

1538
01:28:26,430 --> 01:28:30,300
So should artists wastes their time in 
art school?

1539
01:28:30,301 --> 01:28:32,190
No.
You shouldn't waste your time ever.

1540
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:33,773
I think your question is,
is it necessarily a waste of time to go 

1541
01:28:37,621 --> 01:28:38,454
to art school?
And I would say it depends very much on 

1542
01:28:41,221 --> 01:28:44,580
the art school and are on what you do 
while you're there.

1543
01:28:44,970 --> 01:28:45,803
Um,
if you go to art school and you really 

1544
01:28:49,530 --> 01:28:53,400
work at it like mad and you devote 
yourself to it and you're in the library

1545
01:28:53,401 --> 01:28:54,234
and you're studying the great masters 
and you're crafting your technique and 

1546
01:28:57,301 --> 01:28:59,340
you're at a school where that's actually
possible,

1547
01:28:59,370 --> 01:29:00,203
then you can educate and going to art 
school can give you an identity that 

1548
01:29:04,711 --> 01:29:05,544
allows you to investigate that 
possibility free from undue social 

1549
01:29:10,411 --> 01:29:11,244
pressure for some period of time,
which is really the case with an arts 

1550
01:29:14,101 --> 01:29:18,810
degree or something like that as well.
So if you can take advantage of it,

1551
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:20,453
if you're disciplined enough and if you 
can find a school that isn't completely 

1552
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:24,593
appallingly postmodern and and social 
justice oriented instead of oriented 

1553
01:29:29,581 --> 01:29:32,460
towards art and I don't think it has to 
be a waste of time,

1554
01:29:32,461 --> 01:29:35,370
but I think there's a high probability 
that it will.

1555
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,000
So
serious.

1556
01:29:41,191 --> 01:29:42,024
Respectful question.
Why did you have a problem with Lindsay 

1557
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:48,280
Shepherd being criticized for being non 
critical but you criticized faith Goldie

1558
01:29:48,290 --> 01:29:49,980
for being non critical?
Well,

1559
01:29:53,070 --> 01:29:53,903
the fundamental issue.
I really listened carefully to faith's 

1560
01:29:58,110 --> 01:30:01,460
interview,
the interview that was conducted I think

1561
01:30:01,470 --> 01:30:02,303
with the daily stormer.
I really listened to it and I sat down 

1562
01:30:04,171 --> 01:30:08,530
and listened to it with my son whose 
judgment I respect a lot and

1563
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:11,593
the thing that differentiates the two is
that faith is a journalist and my sense 

1564
01:30:16,011 --> 01:30:16,844
was that

1565
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:20,680
in this situation that she found 
herself,

1566
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,353
it was incumbent on her as a journalist 
to ask at least one or two probing 

1567
01:30:28,991 --> 01:30:29,824
questions given the nature of the people
that know nature and the fact that she 

1568
01:30:33,461 --> 01:30:38,020
knew the nature of the people that she 
was talking to and I don't feel that she

1569
01:30:38,021 --> 01:30:38,854
did it and you know,
I was obviously not alone in my 

1570
01:30:41,830 --> 01:30:42,663
assessment of that.
So her employer who was very favorably 

1571
01:30:45,101 --> 01:30:48,490
predisposed towards her also let her go 
as a consequence of that.

1572
01:30:48,491 --> 01:30:53,491
And so I know that and I've been accused
of being hypocritical as a consequence.

1573
01:30:53,951 --> 01:30:54,784
And I should also say that the decision 
to restructure the panel wasn't mine 

1574
01:30:58,361 --> 01:30:59,194
alone.
It was actually while it was divided up 

1575
01:31:02,561 --> 01:31:05,170
amongst the panel members essentially.
But

1576
01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:10,850
that's what we decided.
That's what we decided and you know,

1577
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:11,803
faith herself had offered to bow out of 
the panel because she knew that her 

1578
01:31:15,831 --> 01:31:20,831
presence would be controversial in a way
that might not be productive.

1579
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:25,580
So whereas Lindsey was just a student,
you know,

1580
01:31:25,581 --> 01:31:26,414
and,
and she was doing what she was supposed 

1581
01:31:27,891 --> 01:31:31,490
to do.
Now I'm not trying to denigrate faith as

1582
01:31:31,491 --> 01:31:34,580
a journalist in it.
Some general sense,

1583
01:31:34,610 --> 01:31:36,830
but
you know,

1584
01:31:37,430 --> 01:31:40,280
Charlottesville was very touchy and,
and it was,

1585
01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:41,263
and it required an unbelievably deft 
hand to go into that sort of rats nest 

1586
01:31:46,761 --> 01:31:47,594
and come out unscathed and you know,
maybe we should think Kudos for her to 

1587
01:31:52,641 --> 01:31:54,800
her for having the courage to even 
attempt it.

1588
01:31:55,190 --> 01:31:56,023
But there's a difference between,
it's not that easy to distinguish 

1589
01:32:01,051 --> 01:32:04,470
between brave and foolhardy and you know
what they say?

1590
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:08,140
Well
anyways,

1591
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:10,210
like I said,
we thought about it a lot.

1592
01:32:10,211 --> 01:32:13,180
I listened to it a lot.
We made the decision we made.

1593
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:15,430
I'm not trying to say that,
you know,

1594
01:32:15,431 --> 01:32:16,264
it was right in some omniscient sense,
but I don't think that the situation 

1595
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:20,733
that Lindsay shepherd found herself in 
is sufficiently comparable to that of 

1596
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:27,400
faith to make the question,

1597
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:32,230
to make the comparison fundamentally 
valid.

1598
01:32:32,410 --> 01:32:34,000
So Ethan,
beyond,

1599
01:32:34,001 --> 01:32:34,990
she says,
I'm a liberal.

1600
01:32:34,991 --> 01:32:36,160
Hi.
Hey Ethan.

1601
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:37,330
Um,
you know,

1602
01:32:39,370 --> 01:32:42,460
I've considered myself a liberal for a 
very long time.

1603
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:44,860
So a welcome.

1604
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:48,043
Do you think I publicly disassociate 
yourself enough with my neo Nazi 

1605
01:32:51,411 --> 01:32:52,244
followers that,
that use your work as justification for 

1606
01:32:55,491 --> 01:32:57,410
violence and propaganda.
Well,

1607
01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:59,570
you know,
what kind of question is that?

1608
01:32:59,930 --> 01:33:00,930
First of all,
you're,

1609
01:33:01,010 --> 01:33:01,843
you're making the unwarranted assumption
that I definitely have neo Nazi 

1610
01:33:05,691 --> 01:33:08,090
followers,
followers,

1611
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:09,283
you know,
and that they use my work as a 

1612
01:33:11,331 --> 01:33:14,840
justification and that they're engaged 
in violence and propaganda.

1613
01:33:14,841 --> 01:33:17,390
It's like how about a specific example 
or,

1614
01:33:17,391 --> 01:33:20,510
or how about 10 specific examples?
You know,

1615
01:33:20,511 --> 01:33:22,670
I already pointed out that,
imagine that.

1616
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:25,300
So 30 million people have watched my 
videos,

1617
01:33:25,301 --> 01:33:28,550
so let's add 500,000 of them are youtube
subscribers.

1618
01:33:28,551 --> 01:33:33,110
So let's say I have 500,000 followers 
just for the sake of argument.

1619
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:34,393
Okay.
Like a thousand of them are going to be 

1620
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:40,970
completely out of their minds because 
that's one in 500.

1621
01:33:41,210 --> 01:33:42,890
So what does that proof,
you know,

1622
01:33:42,891 --> 01:33:43,724
you'd have to demonstrate that there's a
higher rate than average of pathology 

1623
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:52,340
among the people who claim in some 
manner to be my followers.

1624
01:33:52,670 --> 01:33:56,120
You know,
you have to do that because as I said,

1625
01:33:57,890 --> 01:33:58,723
everyone who's to the right of the 
radical left is a group and in that 

1626
01:34:02,211 --> 01:34:04,250
group that was going to be people on the
far right.

1627
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:05,113
That doesn't mean everyone in the group 
of non radical leftists is a radical 

1628
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,910
right winger,
obviously.

1629
01:34:11,660 --> 01:34:14,150
So anyways,
you know,

1630
01:34:14,151 --> 01:34:14,984
I don't.

1631
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:20,120
I think that that's a loaded question.
I think it's loaded in a bunch of ways.

1632
01:34:20,510 --> 01:34:23,900
Do you think you publicly dissociate 
yourself enough?

1633
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:25,333
Well,
that's a loaded question because the 

1634
01:34:27,741 --> 01:34:31,130
implication is that I don't publicly 
dissociate myself enough.

1635
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:31,993
Then the next implication is that I have
more neo Nazi followers than a random 

1636
01:34:36,801 --> 01:34:39,530
person with 500,000 followers would 
have.

1637
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:44,330
And then the next like loaded bit is 
that they use my work as justification.

1638
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:46,640
I'd like to see that happen because I 
can't see it,

1639
01:34:46,641 --> 01:34:47,474
how it can possibly be used as 
justification and that they use it as a 

1640
01:34:50,421 --> 01:34:53,150
justification for both propaganda and 
violence.

1641
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:54,740
It's like really?
Come on.

1642
01:34:55,710 --> 01:35:00,710
Yeah,
you know,

1643
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:05,320
maybe it's possible.
And if this is the case,

1644
01:35:05,321 --> 01:35:06,154
I apologize.
It's possible that you wrote that 

1645
01:35:07,841 --> 01:35:11,160
question because you were favorably 
disposed towards me and you know,

1646
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:14,710
wanted to give me an opportunity to 
address that question and you know,

1647
01:35:14,711 --> 01:35:15,544
I can't tell but,
but it is definitely the kind of 

1648
01:35:18,551 --> 01:35:19,384
question that,
that sort of journalists who have been 

1649
01:35:21,371 --> 01:35:23,350
coming after me have been,
you know,

1650
01:35:23,351 --> 01:35:25,690
it's like,
have you stopped beating your wife yet?

1651
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:26,553
It's like,
how are you going to answer a question 

1652
01:35:27,371 --> 01:35:28,990
like that?
You losing their way.

1653
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:32,200
So.
Okay.

1654
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:39,740
Well I think what I'm going to do,
I'm starting to run out of energy here,

1655
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:46,000
so I'm going to read some of this.

1656
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:48,730
Okay.
All right.

1657
01:35:48,750 --> 01:35:51,060
What the hell addressed the Jewish 
question?

1658
01:35:51,150 --> 01:35:54,060
That's a hell of a thing to ask.
So that's Jack Linter,

1659
01:35:54,090 --> 01:35:54,923
you know,
I mean really that's a hell of a thing 

1660
01:35:55,981 --> 01:35:58,110
to ask,
but I will say something about it,

1661
01:35:58,710 --> 01:36:00,660
you know,
and I've thought about this a lot.

1662
01:36:00,661 --> 01:36:03,960
So there is evidence that Ashkenazi 
Jews,

1663
01:36:03,961 --> 01:36:05,880
so those are the Jews of European 
heritage,

1664
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:09,570
have iqs that are about 15 points higher
than the population average.

1665
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:10,433
So that's a lot 15 points.
It's about the average difference 

1666
01:36:12,511 --> 01:36:15,690
between the typical high school student 
and the typical state college student.

1667
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:18,840
It's a lot.
And one of the things that means is,

1668
01:36:18,841 --> 01:36:19,674
so imagine there's two distributions and
that they overlap and that the Jewish 

1669
01:36:22,411 --> 01:36:23,560
one is,
uh,

1670
01:36:24,210 --> 01:36:25,043
is the mean is 1:15.
So the whole distribution is shifted to 

1671
01:36:29,641 --> 01:36:32,130
the right.
What that means is if you go up into the

1672
01:36:32,131 --> 01:36:34,380
Higher Iq strata,
1:30,

1673
01:36:34,381 --> 01:36:35,214
1:45 way the hell up there,
that Jewish people are overwhelmingly 

1674
01:36:38,611 --> 01:36:41,400
overrepresented at the high end of the 
ICU distribution.

1675
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:42,593
Now the price they paid for that is some
increased propensity for neurological 

1676
01:36:45,811 --> 01:36:49,530
diseases that seems to be associated in 
some sense with that heightened Iq.

1677
01:36:49,890 --> 01:36:50,641
Now,
you know,

1678
01:36:50,641 --> 01:36:53,300
the science on this isn't settled but,
but it,

1679
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:54,233
it's reasonably solid.
It all given the standards of such 

1680
01:36:59,071 --> 01:36:59,910
things.
Okay,

1681
01:36:59,911 --> 01:37:00,744
so Jews are going to be over represented
at the high end of cognitively complex 

1682
01:37:05,431 --> 01:37:07,470
disciplines.
So then I would say,

1683
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:08,783
and that's the case,
like they're way over represented among 

1684
01:37:10,830 --> 01:37:14,760
outstanding scientists and among Nobel 
Prize winners and and so forth.

1685
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:17,430
And so you know,
people look and they think,

1686
01:37:17,431 --> 01:37:18,264
well why are there a disproportionate 
number of Jewish people in positions of 

1687
01:37:21,691 --> 01:37:22,381
authority?
And they say,

1688
01:37:22,381 --> 01:37:24,150
well,
it must be a conspiracy.

1689
01:37:24,510 --> 01:37:27,150
You know,
it must be systemic in some sense.

1690
01:37:27,151 --> 01:37:27,984
It's like,
no,

1691
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:32,280
it can be simply accounted for by that 
relatively large ICU differential.

1692
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:35,160
Now the next criticism would be,
well,

1693
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:37,650
don't the Jews tend to lean left?

1694
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:39,420
Well first you might say,
well,

1695
01:37:39,570 --> 01:37:40,403
you know,
given what happened in Nazi Germany to 

1696
01:37:43,111 --> 01:37:45,690
the degree that that was right wing as 
we discussed earlier,

1697
01:37:45,691 --> 01:37:47,640
that's the nationalism and 
ethnocentrism.

1698
01:37:47,641 --> 01:37:50,610
It's hardly surprising that they might,
you know,

1699
01:37:50,611 --> 01:37:54,300
in this historical period of time tend 
to move towards the left.

1700
01:37:54,540 --> 01:37:58,650
But more than that,
Iq is associated with trait,

1701
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:02,340
openness and trade.
Openness is a strong predictor predictor

1702
01:38:02,341 --> 01:38:04,830
of political liberalism.
So,

1703
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,740
and it's the strongest predictor of 
political liberalism.

1704
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:09,240
So,
you know,

1705
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:13,140
it's very difficult.
So that's what I have to say about that.

1706
01:38:13,141 --> 01:38:14,820
It's like.
And the other thing I would say is,

1707
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:16,193
you know,
the fact that there's a population of 

1708
01:38:18,461 --> 01:38:22,080
sub population of people who are much 
smarter than average,

1709
01:38:22,110 --> 01:38:23,580
not on average,
right?

1710
01:38:23,670 --> 01:38:27,210
On average,
I've got to get that straight on average

1711
01:38:27,211 --> 01:38:28,044
is actually of great benefit to the rest
of us because why do you want fewer 

1712
01:38:31,111 --> 01:38:31,980
geniuses?

1713
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:37,490
Fewer people with Iq of 145 or 160.
That's and you know,

1714
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:41,430
and it's no conspiracy that puts people 
who are smarter,

1715
01:38:41,610 --> 01:38:42,443
higher up in competence hierarchies 
because I accused the best predictor of 

1716
01:38:45,241 --> 01:38:48,330
movement up in a complex con competence 
hierarchy.

1717
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:51,270
So there,
I've addressed the Jewish question.

1718
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:52,253
It's like it's a confusion between 
ethnicity and and ICU as far as I'm 

1719
01:38:56,641 --> 01:38:57,474
concerned.
So I'll probably get like painted six 

1720
01:38:59,701 --> 01:39:01,530
different shades of black for that 
answer.

1721
01:39:01,531 --> 01:39:03,750
But it's,
I've thought about a long time.

1722
01:39:03,751 --> 01:39:06,330
It's the best that I can manage.
So.

1723
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:09,990
Okay,
I'm going to read this.

1724
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:11,760
Oh,
what huckleberry says,

1725
01:39:11,761 --> 01:39:13,950
should I start with past author three?
If I am 40,

1726
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:15,233
I feel that I have so many unsolved 
issues from my past that prevents me 

1727
01:39:17,731 --> 01:39:21,570
from accomplishing my potential from 
accomplishing my potential.

1728
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:22,830
Mostly fear.
Yes.

1729
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:24,073
They,
the way that you wrote that indicates 

1730
01:39:25,561 --> 01:39:29,220
very clearly that you should do the past
authoring first because you already know

1731
01:39:29,221 --> 01:39:30,054
that you have unpleasant incidences or 
incidents in your past that are 

1732
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:36,360
impairing your function.
So.

1733
01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:38,520
Alright,
so I'm gonna read.

1734
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:39,870
I'm gonna.
Read this.

1735
01:39:41,490 --> 01:39:44,580
Hopefully you can see that there's an 
illustration there.

1736
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:45,883
Um,
I'm going to hold it up so that I can 

1737
01:39:47,611 --> 01:39:48,444
see it.

1738
01:39:50,010 --> 01:39:52,530
There's a lag.
So I don't know if it's in focus.

1739
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:54,390
So give me about 10 seconds.

1740
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:02,433
Okay.

1741
01:40:08,230 --> 01:40:12,190
Okay.
So this is chapter four rule for.

1742
01:40:12,191 --> 01:40:16,540
So the book has 12 rules in the book is 
called 12 rules for life

1743
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:23,010
and it's published by penguin random 
house and it'll be out January 23rd.

1744
01:40:23,070 --> 01:40:27,450
And so this is a book,
this is chapter rule six.

1745
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:28,373
Um,

1746
01:40:36,050 --> 01:40:37,610
there's 12 rules,
pence,

1747
01:40:37,611 --> 01:40:38,444
the title,
and they were taken from a subset of 42 

1748
01:40:41,511 --> 01:40:42,344
rules that I wrote for a quora article 
called what are the most important 

1749
01:40:45,321 --> 01:40:47,390
things that everyone should know,
something like that.

1750
01:40:47,391 --> 01:40:50,960
A very popular cora
article.

1751
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:52,633
Now,
the illustration was done by Ethan van 

1752
01:40:54,041 --> 01:40:54,874
skiver,
who's a comic book artist and a good 

1753
01:40:58,421 --> 01:41:00,280
one.
So you can look up his work if you want.

1754
01:41:00,281 --> 01:41:02,900
It's v a n,
s,

1755
01:41:02,901 --> 01:41:03,734
C I v e r Ethan.
This chapter is about the motivation 

1756
01:41:08,531 --> 01:41:11,830
behind the actions of people like to 
call them by and killers.

1757
01:41:11,831 --> 01:41:12,664
And the illustration is of a very,
very criminally oriented individual 

1758
01:41:18,190 --> 01:41:21,190
called named Carl Pans Ram.
You could look him up,

1759
01:41:21,191 --> 01:41:26,191
p a n Zed r a,
m who was a very resentful,

1760
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:27,910
vicious,
violent,

1761
01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:29,343
destructive and intelligent person 
because those things can all go 

1762
01:41:32,801 --> 01:41:33,634
together.
So rule six is called set your house in 

1763
01:41:37,301 --> 01:41:40,930
perfect order before you criticize the 
world.

1764
01:41:43,490 --> 01:41:45,600
And the chapters all have little sub 
chapter.

1765
01:41:45,601 --> 01:41:48,560
So the title of this chapter is a 
religious problem.

1766
01:41:52,910 --> 01:41:53,743
It does not seem reasonable to describe 
the young man who shot 20 children and 

1767
01:41:57,681 --> 01:42:01,070
six staff members at Sandy Hook 
Elementary School in Newton,

1768
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:04,850
Connecticut in 2012 as a religious 
person.

1769
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:06,973
This is equally true for the Colorado 
theater gunman and the columbine high 

1770
01:42:10,101 --> 01:42:10,934
school killers,
but these murderous individuals had a 

1771
01:42:13,311 --> 01:42:16,400
problem with reality that existed at a 
religious depth.

1772
01:42:17,330 --> 01:42:19,910
As one of the members of the columbine 
duo wrote,

1773
01:42:20,930 --> 01:42:24,770
the human race isn't worth fighting for 
only worth killing.

1774
01:42:24,890 --> 01:42:25,723
Give the earth back to the animals.
They deserve it infinitely more than we 

1775
01:42:29,241 --> 01:42:32,180
do.
Nothing means anything anymore.

1776
01:42:33,890 --> 01:42:36,980
People who viewed people who think such 
things,

1777
01:42:36,981 --> 01:42:37,814
view being itself is inequitable and 
harsh to the point of corruption and 

1778
01:42:41,811 --> 01:42:44,360
human being in particular as 
contemptible.

1779
01:42:44,870 --> 01:42:45,703
They appoint themselves supreme 
adjudicators of reality and find it 

1780
01:42:49,551 --> 01:42:52,580
wanting.
They're the ultimate critics.

1781
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:57,650
The deeply cynical writer continues.
If you recall your history,

1782
01:42:57,651 --> 01:42:58,484
the Nazis came up with a quote,
final solution and quote to the Jewish 

1783
01:43:02,001 --> 01:43:03,950
problem,
kill them all.

1784
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:06,560
Well,
in case you haven't figured it out,

1785
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:10,940
I say kill mankind.
No one should survive.

1786
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:13,603
For such individuals,
the world of experiences insufficient 

1787
01:43:15,741 --> 01:43:17,990
and evil,
so to hell with everything.

1788
01:43:19,630 --> 01:43:22,150
What is happening when someone comes to 
thinking in this manner,

1789
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:26,590
a great German play,
foust a tragedy written by your hand.

1790
01:43:26,591 --> 01:43:31,390
Wolfgang von Gurta addresses that issue.
The plays main character,

1791
01:43:31,510 --> 01:43:32,343
a scholar named Heinrich Faust trades 
his immortal soul to the devil 

1792
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:38,110
Mephistopheles.
In return,

1793
01:43:38,111 --> 01:43:43,111
he receives whatever he desires while 
still alive on earth and this play,

1794
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:46,900
Mephistopheles is the eternal adversary 
of being.

1795
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:48,513
He has a central defining credo.
I am the spirit who negates and rightly 

1796
01:43:55,431 --> 01:43:59,810
so for all that comes to be,
deserves to perish wretchedly.

1797
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:03,030
We're better.
Nothing would begin.

1798
01:44:04,150 --> 01:44:09,150
Does everything that you term sin,
destruction and evil represent.

1799
01:44:11,190 --> 01:44:12,510
That's my proper element.

1800
01:44:15,110 --> 01:44:16,980
Dirt.
The considered this hateful sentiment,

1801
01:44:16,990 --> 01:44:17,823
so important,
so key to the central element of 

1802
01:44:21,061 --> 01:44:23,610
vengeful human destructiveness that he 
add.

1803
01:44:23,611 --> 01:44:24,444
Mephistopheles repeated a second time 
phrase somewhat differently in part two 

1804
01:44:28,201 --> 01:44:33,201
of the play written many years later,
people think often in the memphis to and

1805
01:44:33,950 --> 01:44:35,540
manner,
although they sell them,

1806
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:39,780
act upon their thoughts as brutally as 
the mass murderers of school,

1807
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:40,793
college and theater.
Whenever we experienced injustice real 

1808
01:44:45,021 --> 01:44:45,854
or imagined,
whenever we encountered tragedy or fall 

1809
01:44:48,261 --> 01:44:49,094
prey to the machinations of others,
whenever we experienced the horror and 

1810
01:44:52,251 --> 01:44:55,370
pain of our own apparently arbitrary 
limitations,

1811
01:44:55,610 --> 01:44:56,443
the temptation to question being and 
then to curse it rises Fowley from the 

1812
01:45:00,891 --> 01:45:01,724
darkness.
Why must innocent people suffer so 

1813
01:45:04,371 --> 01:45:08,180
terribly?
What kind of bloody horrible places this

1814
01:45:08,181 --> 01:45:09,014
anyways?

1815
01:45:10,810 --> 01:45:12,370
Life is in truth,
very hard.

1816
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:15,970
Everyone is destined for pain and slated
for destruction.

1817
01:45:17,050 --> 01:45:17,883
Sometimes suffering is clearly the 
result of personal faults such as 

1818
01:45:20,621 --> 01:45:23,560
willful blindness,
poor decision making or malevolence.

1819
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:27,460
In such cases when it appears to be self
inflicted,

1820
01:45:27,730 --> 01:45:31,450
it may even seem just people get what 
they deserve.

1821
01:45:31,451 --> 01:45:34,720
You might contend that's cold comfort.
However,

1822
01:45:34,721 --> 01:45:38,440
even when true sometimes if those are 
suffering,

1823
01:45:38,441 --> 01:45:39,274
change their behavior,
then their lives would unfold less 

1824
01:45:41,861 --> 01:45:44,680
tragically,
but human control is limited.

1825
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:47,320
Susceptibility to despair,
disease,

1826
01:45:47,321 --> 01:45:52,150
aging and death is universal.
In the final analysis,

1827
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:55,240
we do not appear to be the architects of
our own fragility.

1828
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:57,580
Whose fault is it?
Then?

1829
01:46:00,210 --> 01:46:05,210
People who are very will ill or worse,
who have a sick child,

1830
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:09,390
will inevitably find themselves asking 
this question whether they are religious

1831
01:46:09,391 --> 01:46:10,224
believers are not.
The same is true of someone who finds 

1832
01:46:12,601 --> 01:46:13,434
his shirt sleeve caught in the gears of 
a giant bureaucracy who is suffering 

1833
01:46:17,251 --> 01:46:21,210
through a tax audit or fighting and 
interminable lawsuit or divorce,

1834
01:46:22,170 --> 01:46:23,003
and it's not only the obviously 
suffering who are tormented by the need 

1835
01:46:25,711 --> 01:46:29,700
to blame someone or something for the 
intolerable state of their being

1836
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:35,200
at the very height of his fame,
influence and creative power.

1837
01:46:35,201 --> 01:46:37,480
For example,
the towering Leo.

1838
01:46:37,481 --> 01:46:40,900
Tolstoy began to question the value of 
human existence.

1839
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:42,910
He reasoned in this way.

1840
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:45,633
My position was terrible.
I knew that I could find nothing in the 

1841
01:46:47,981 --> 01:46:50,550
way of rational knowledge,
denial of life,

1842
01:46:50,730 --> 01:46:55,050
and in faith I could find nothing except
it did not have reason and this was even

1843
01:46:55,051 --> 01:46:59,610
more impossible than it denial of life.
According to rational knowledge.

1844
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:02,550
It followed that life is evil.
People know it.

1845
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:05,970
They do not have to live yet.
They have lived and they do live.

1846
01:47:06,330 --> 01:47:07,163
Just as I myself have lived,
even though I had known for a long time 

1847
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:15,560
that life is meaningless and evil
tracy might told story,

1848
01:47:15,591 --> 01:47:19,040
could only identify for means of 
escaping from such thoughts.

1849
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:22,460
One was retreating into child like 
ignorance of the problem.

1850
01:47:22,630 --> 01:47:23,463
Another was pursuing mindless pleasure.
The third was continuing to drag out a 

1851
01:47:28,431 --> 01:47:32,840
life that is evil and meaningless.
Knowing beforehand that nothing can come

1852
01:47:32,841 --> 01:47:33,674
of it.
He identified that particular form of 

1853
01:47:36,651 --> 01:47:37,484
escape with weakness.
The people in this category know that 

1854
01:47:41,061 --> 01:47:44,180
death is better than life,
but they do not have the strength to act

1855
01:47:44,181 --> 01:47:47,840
rationally and quickly put it into the 
delusion by killing themselves.

1856
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:50,753
Only.
The fourth and final mode of escape 

1857
01:47:51,901 --> 01:47:54,900
involved open quote,
strength and energy.

1858
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:56,093
It consists of destroying life.
Once one has realized that life is evil 

1859
01:47:59,761 --> 01:48:01,440
and meaningless,
close quote,

1860
01:48:01,830 --> 01:48:04,380
tall story relentlessly followed his 
thoughts,

1861
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:09,300
only unusually strong and logically 
consistent.

1862
01:48:09,301 --> 01:48:13,020
People act in this manner.
Having realized all the stupidity of the

1863
01:48:13,021 --> 01:48:13,854
joke that is being played on us and 
seeing that the blessings of the dead 

1864
01:48:16,321 --> 01:48:20,040
are greater than those of the living and
that it is better not to exist.

1865
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:22,860
They act and put it into this stupid 
joke.

1866
01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:26,220
They use any means of doing it.
A rope around the neck,

1867
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:28,200
water,
a knife in the heart.

1868
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:33,680
A train
toy story wasn't pessimistic enough.

1869
01:48:34,230 --> 01:48:38,700
The stupidity of the joke being played 
in us does not merely motivate suicide.

1870
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:43,470
Good motivates murder.
Mass murder often followed by suicide.

1871
01:48:43,620 --> 01:48:48,620
Now it's a far more effective 
existential protest by June of 2016.

1872
01:48:49,921 --> 01:48:53,430
Unbelievable as it may seem,
there had been 1000.

1873
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:54,293
Mass killings defined is far more people
shot into a single incident excluding 

1874
01:48:58,081 --> 01:48:58,914
the shooter in the US and 1,260 days.
That's one such event on five of every 

1875
01:49:04,891 --> 01:49:07,050
six days for more than three years.

1876
01:49:08,690 --> 01:49:11,120
Everyone says,
we don't understand.

1877
01:49:12,290 --> 01:49:16,430
How can we still pretend that tall story
understood more than a century ago.

1878
01:49:17,150 --> 01:49:17,983
The ancient authors of the Biblical 
story of Cain and Abel understood as 

1879
01:49:20,421 --> 01:49:22,340
well.
More than 20 centuries ago,

1880
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:24,253
they described murder as the first act 
of post identic history and not just 

1881
01:49:28,191 --> 01:49:31,790
murder,
but fratricidal murder and murder.

1882
01:49:31,791 --> 01:49:32,624
Not only if someone innocent,
but if someone ideal and good and 

1883
01:49:36,501 --> 01:49:39,680
murdered unconsciously despite the 
creator of the universe.

1884
01:49:40,790 --> 01:49:43,700
Today's killers tell us the same thing 
in their own words,

1885
01:49:44,570 --> 01:49:48,010
who would dare say that this is not the 
worm at the core of the apple,

1886
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:49,593
but we will not listen because the truth
cuts too close to the bone even for a 

1887
01:49:54,071 --> 01:49:54,904
minute,
as profound as that of the celebrated 

1888
01:49:56,501 --> 01:49:58,660
Russian author,
there was no way out.

1889
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:00,213
How can the rest of us manage when 
amount of tolstoy stature admits defeat 

1890
01:50:04,690 --> 01:50:05,523
for years,
he hit his guns from himself and would 

1891
01:50:07,781 --> 01:50:11,680
not walk with a rope in his hand in case
he hanged himself.

1892
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:17,410
How can a person who is awake avoid 
outrage at the world?

1893
01:50:22,490 --> 01:50:27,080
The next sub chapters called vengeance 
or transformation well,

1894
01:50:27,081 --> 01:50:27,914
and the rest of the trap chapter 
attempts to answer the questions that I 

1895
01:50:31,131 --> 01:50:31,964
posed in that beginning and hopefully 
I've managed it at least in some small 

1896
01:50:35,691 --> 01:50:36,524
way anyways.
Now it's a bit from one chapter of this 

1897
01:50:40,671 --> 01:50:42,230
book,
12 rules for life,

1898
01:50:42,231 --> 01:50:46,130
an antidote to chaos.
It comes out January 23rd.

1899
01:50:46,610 --> 01:50:49,730
It's available for preorder.
For those of you who might be interested

1900
01:50:49,731 --> 01:50:54,731
on Amazon.com and Amazon.ca,
and it's quite heavily discounted at the

1901
01:50:55,371 --> 01:50:56,204
moment.
I think it's 50 percent off on the 

1902
01:50:57,351 --> 01:51:00,440
Canadian site,
35 percent off on the American site.

1903
01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:01,583
Um,
maybe I'll put a link in the 

1904
01:51:03,321 --> 01:51:04,790
description.
Um,

1905
01:51:05,690 --> 01:51:07,700
I hope that the book is helpful.
Um,

1906
01:51:14,450 --> 01:51:15,283
I,
I,

1907
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:16,153
I put a lot of work into it and I think 
it's advanced my thinking quite a bit 

1908
01:51:20,150 --> 01:51:20,983
and,

1909
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:23,553
and I think it's readable.
I've a lot of people have looked at it 

1910
01:51:25,991 --> 01:51:26,824
now and I've had good editors and so on 
and I think that I tried to make it as 

1911
01:51:29,891 --> 01:51:30,724
accessible as possible.
I mean it deals with ideas that are 

1912
01:51:32,771 --> 01:51:34,970
pretty sophisticated,
but um,

1913
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:37,473
I'm hoping I got the balance between 
complexity and sophistication and ease 

1914
01:51:42,371 --> 01:51:43,330
of access.
Right.

1915
01:51:43,331 --> 01:51:44,740
Tight.
I certainly hope so.

1916
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,440
And I hope it's kind of poetic,
you know,

1917
01:51:47,470 --> 01:51:48,303
because I tried to make each sentence 
scan properly and have a rhythm and all 

1918
01:51:51,401 --> 01:51:52,840
of that.
Anyways,

1919
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:57,280
um,
my wife has made thanksgiving,

1920
01:51:57,790 --> 01:52:01,150
it's not Canadian thanksgiving,
American thanksgiving,

1921
01:52:01,151 --> 01:52:01,984
but we celebrate both of them because my
son is American and we lived in the 

1922
01:52:05,621 --> 01:52:06,454
states for quite a few years.
So I'm going to go and see my grandkids 

1923
01:52:09,611 --> 01:52:13,360
and my son and my daughter and all the 
other people that are around me.

1924
01:52:13,361 --> 01:52:15,620
Thank God.
And um,

1925
01:52:16,270 --> 01:52:21,160
thanks for listening guys and for being 
interested in.

1926
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:25,360
I hope you get your acts together and 
fix up the world a

1927
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:30,460
till next time.
Bye.

1928
01:52:30,461 --> 01:52:31,294
Bye.
