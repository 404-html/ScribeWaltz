1
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:04,723
Yeah.

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,630
So yeah,
my name's Christine van Gyn.

3
00:00:10,631 --> 00:00:14,260
I'm currently the Ontario director of 
the Canadian Taxpayers Federation.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,960
Uh,
we work on issues of lower taxes,

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,830
government waste and accountability.
And oddly enough,

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,860
this is the third time in six months 
that I've done a speech or talk publicly

7
00:00:25,991 --> 00:00:30,820
about the issue of free speech and 
specifically free speech on campus.

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,043
Um,
I think that this is a defining topic 

9
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:35,523
and mood of of 2017 and oddly support 
for free speech is increasingly falling 

10
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:47,011
along partisan or ideological lines.
Now CTF,

11
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,573
we at the Canadian Taxpayers Federation,
we deal exclusively with fiscal and 

12
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:57,250
economic issues and you would think that
that subject,

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,790
government debt,
generational debt and balanced budgets,

14
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:01,863
you know what,
you would think that that's non 

15
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,310
controversial but not so on university 
campuses.

16
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:08,920
Our student group,
a generation screwed,

17
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,993
has been kicked off of campuses,
had room space denied and we were even 

18
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:14,164
told by one university student union 
that we may need to change our name 

19
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,160
generation screwed because screwed is 
oppressive.

20
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:28,120
So while we may not have encountered the
kind of blow back that some of,

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,113
uh,
some of the speakers today will have 

22
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:32,720
received from universities,
um,

23
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,783
it just goes to show you how little it 
takes to trigger a university 

24
00:01:37,871 --> 00:01:42,850
administrators and students on campuses 
and just how restrictive and ham fisted,

25
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,770
uh,
they,

26
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,990
they can work at how they can act when 
restricting speeds.

27
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:47,710
So,
uh,

28
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,630
with that,
I will introduce our speakers.

29
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,690
Uh,
our first panelist is God sad.

30
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:55,660
He's the professor of marketing at 
Concordia University,

31
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,533
Montreal Canada.
He's the holder of the Concordia 

32
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,503
University Research Chair in 
evolutionary behavioral science and the 

33
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:06,820
Darwinian con con consumption,
sorry.

34
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,781
He,
uh,

35
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:09,250
is also quilt.
No wait,

36
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,710
quite well known for his popular Youtube
Channel.

37
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,693
The sad truth.
A channel that has garnered over 4 

38
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:16,803
million views.
Yeah.

39
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,650
Okay.

40
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,440
So everyone,
please welcome God sad.

41
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:20,450
Okay.

42
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,140
Our second panelist is they're not 
sitting in the right order,

43
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:24,974
but I'll enter.
This is the order in which they will 

44
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:28,580
present a,
it's a,

45
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:33,581
it's John carpay on the far end.
He's the president of the Justice Center

46
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,993
for Constitutional Freedoms and 
organization that he founded to defend 

47
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:41,390
the constitutional freedoms of Canadians
through litigation and education.

48
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,463
He has a BA in political science at 
Laval University in Quebec City and a 

49
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:47,630
law degree from the University of 
Calgary.

50
00:02:47,631 --> 00:02:48,464
So please welcome John Carpet.
And our third panelist is Jordan 

51
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:56,820
Peterson's.
He did in the middle.

52
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,553
He's a psychology professor at the 
University of Toronto and a clinical 

53
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:03,340
psychologist with two main areas of 
study,

54
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,040
the psychology of belief,
including religion,

55
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:06,963
mythology and political ideology,
and the assessment and improvement of 

56
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:13,090
personality,
including the prediction of creativity,

57
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,250
academic and industrial performance.
So everyone,

58
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:16,720
please welcome John and Peter

59
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,600
and we're going to begin with remarks 
from Mr Sod.

60
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,800
Thank you very much.
All right,

61
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:36,090
so apparently a food restaurant or here 
in Ottawa caused me some food poisoning.

62
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:42,070
So even the restauranters are trying to 
stifle my famous speech because I almost

63
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:44,700
didn't make it to the session.
Uh,

64
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,950
so what are some strategies for stifling
opposing opinions?

65
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:48,784
If you live in a dictatorship,
then of course you just killed the 

66
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:52,840
intellectuals.
Those who oppose you,

67
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,093
you get rid of them.
If you are unable to implement such a 

68
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:57,274
strategy,
then you perhaps have some hate speech 

69
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,043
laws or some campus speech codes and of 
course what flows from that is the 

70
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:06,604
third.
A way to stifle people is to create an 

71
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:13,810
environment that is sufficiently ominous
that people engage in self censorship.

72
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,930
This picture right here is worth a 
thousand words.

73
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,913
It basically says we condemn freedom of 
speech that hurts other people's 

74
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:24,384
feelings.
What I'm going to do for the rest of 

75
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:27,864
today's lecture is simply read to you 
first person accounts of emails that I 

76
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:35,340
received.
I received these in there enumerable.

77
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,950
How many I received were for either 
students,

78
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,813
professors,
parents are writing to me to document 

79
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,950
the stuff that they are facing on 
campuses.

80
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:48,180
And the best way to actually show you 
this is to just read a bunch of them.

81
00:04:48,181 --> 00:04:52,140
So bear with me as I actually go through
about seven or eight of these.

82
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,970
The clock by the way,
is not working.

83
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:56,580
So I don't know how much time we have,
but I'll assume we're okay.

84
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,863
So here is a student testimony example 
one I'm a 47 year old white male who 

85
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:04,590
because of an injury made a choice to 
return to school.

86
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,860
Sadly,
it looks like my path through university

87
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:10,620
is going to be interrupted and the first
year to maintain full time status,

88
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,920
I'm forced to take another social 
justice black lives matter.

89
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:14,754
Of course,
the challenge is students are not 

90
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:19,890
allowed to challenge or question the 
course content because that's considered

91
00:05:19,891 --> 00:05:23,250
disrespectful and may disrupt someone's 
safe space.

92
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,510
I believe I am a respectful students 
with good attendance and who's the marks

93
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:28,344
average in the mid eighties that said,
after a few weeks of the one side is 

94
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:31,883
syllabus,
I'm considering dropping out of the 

95
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:35,920
program and leaving school entirely.
This left,

96
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:37,980
this academic world is a little too much
for me.

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,833
Testimony to today,
we had a panel discussion on the Quebec 

98
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:43,134
city shooting with two historians and 
two sociologists where I was told with 

99
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:47,034
solid moral,
righteous stone that there is no such 

100
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:49,584
thing as good and bad immigrants.
My heart was racing and my teeth were 

101
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:55,520
clenched,
sorry,

102
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,710
and grinding to this.

103
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,573
Finally,
the spite my heart beating out of my 

104
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:01,070
chest.
I asked a question,

105
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,760
how do you,
the panel interpret Charlie Hebdo,

106
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,773
the Danish cartoon,
Isis Salman Rushdie and the bataclan 

107
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:08,984
shootings.
The denial of individual responsibility 

108
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:14,840
and complete disregard for any value 
based interpretation was off the table.

109
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,610
I think I screwed myself because I'm 
pretty sure my professor is,

110
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,623
let's say,
quite suspicious of me now because this 

111
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:26,210
person aired his opinion.
He knows that he's in trouble.

112
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,660
I just feel really alone,
but the thought of restoring strength,

113
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:34,520
tolerance and diversity of factory 
university really keeps me going today.

114
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:38,390
Just really proved to me that I'm up 
against and how alone I am.

115
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:39,224
What can I do?
I'm reaching out to you in the hopes 

116
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:42,674
that the godfather that's yours truly
would be able to help direct my future 

117
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:48,794
research projects.
Since most professors and required 

118
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:51,794
courses I have to take seem to be run by
Social Justice Warriors Feigning 

119
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,730
Intellectual Ism.

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,180
The reason I'm contacting you is because
as an honors cognitive student,

121
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,200
part of my requirements is to complete 
12 credits worth of individual research.

122
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,620
However,
because of purely political reasons,

123
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,140
I'm apparently a violent,
misogynist,

124
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,003
racist trump supporter.
I have not only lost my job at a 

125
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:15,770
prestigious behavioral neuroscience 
laboratory.

126
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,750
I had the identity at why,
why,

127
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:18,584
why,
but my name has been removed from the 

128
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:21,554
publication on research I personally 
conducted and the lead researcher told 

129
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:28,520
me that he would never work with me 
again.

130
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,220
This is not North Korea,
this is Canada.

131
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:32,054
This is US help.
I'm a fourth year student and a five 

132
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:39,130
year teaching program.
I'll be heading to why,

133
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,570
why,
why,

134
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,710
and next year for my one year of 
Teacher's college,

135
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,573
only recently have I realized the 
radical left wing messages embedded in 

136
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:48,164
virtually all of my classes and I know 
that it will only get worse at the 

137
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,490
school in question.

138
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,043
What can I do about this?
How do I stand up for the truth without 

139
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,210
risking my career as an elementary 
school teacher?

140
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,880
Thank you.
Let's move on to some faculty.

141
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:02,714
Those were all students.
I very much appreciate your courage to 

142
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:09,050
fight the cancer that is taking over 
American academia.

143
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,340
People like me feel cheated and their 
attempt to pursue a tenure track career.

144
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,353
It only takes a glimpse to the job 
offerings that the modern language 

145
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:17,774
association publishes each year to 
understand what is expected from recent 

146
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:25,280
graduates like me.
It is political activism and I refuse to

147
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:26,114
mix that with my academic interests.
I will save you my long stories of 

148
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:30,614
dealing and suffering career wise from 
politically correct nonsense from the 

149
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,390
directions of feminism,
gender,

150
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:38,320
ideology,
trans extremism and Islamophobia.

151
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,170
I am trying to keep a lid on things for 
now as my wife is very,

152
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,230
as a very promising academic but hasn't 
security position yet.

153
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,460
I know that if I started voicing my 
thoughts and arguments on social media,

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,460
she'll be completely shut out of the 
academy.

155
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,503
If she does secure a tenure track spot,
I'm off to the races and you and others 

156
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:59,400
would see that I'm an ally to take 
notice of.

157
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:02,100
Seriously.
I'm more than happy to transition out of

158
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:02,934
philosophy at this point,
which has become a virtue signaling 

159
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:06,264
competition.
As a fellow professor who has been 

160
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:09,864
frustrated by the discourse within 
academia on issues such as political 

161
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:14,100
correctness,
moral relativism,

162
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:14,934
and social justice.
I'd like to thank you for speaking up 

163
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:18,050
the way you have,
uh,

164
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:18,943
been from within academia.
Why my training and research as further 

165
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:22,734
removed from social issues than yours?
I have nevertheless been frustrated by 

166
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:28,770
the conformism and group think I see and
hear around me.

167
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,813
I see.
Otherwise very reasonable and capable 

168
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:32,094
people abandoning reason and counting to
the narrative of the regressive left on 

169
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:36,720
many social issues.

170
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,793
These are all things which I would like 
to get involved in once the tenure 

171
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:42,900
decision is behind me,
about one year to go.

172
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,913
As upsetting as it is,
one fierce expressing unpopular social 

173
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,544
ideas prior to tenure and the meantime,
please keep fighting the good fight for 

174
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:54,450
freedom of speech and against start 
policing and orthodoxy.

175
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,270
Almost done.
I won't read this whole one,

176
00:09:57,271 --> 00:10:00,930
but basically this person writes to me 
and thanking me for my conversation with

177
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:01,764
Sam Harris,
agreeing with some of the issues that I 

178
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:07,080
raised regarding some issues dealing 
with Islam.

179
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,093
But then look at the bottom.
He says if you decide to mention this 

180
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:10,944
information in your videos,
I would ask that you do so without 

181
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,220
mentioning my name.
I do not have tenure yet.

182
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,280
This is from uh,
uh,

183
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,290
this is the last testimony and then I'll
wrap up.

184
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,540
This is from a parent of a high school 
student.

185
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,973
I recently received an email from my 
son's school district that they are 

186
00:10:28,471 --> 00:10:31,770
going to be screening a film called,
I'm not racist,

187
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:35,820
am I as an in school field trip at the 
end of January for high school students.

188
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,863
I did some preliminary research on this 
and I'm absolutely appalled at the 

189
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:43,290
content of the movie based on the 
descriptions,

190
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,510
the trailer and additional materials 
surrounding it.

191
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,940
It appears to be a feature length film 
pushing the agendas of white privilege,

192
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,190
institutional racism and white people 
are the problem.

193
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,653
It's scares me beyond belief that they 
are attempting to force these ideas on 

194
00:10:57,811 --> 00:11:02,811
developing minds and now of course the 
usual request that they be anonymous for

195
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,640
reference.
My son is a junior at xxx.

196
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,683
I have included the original email as 
well as the pdf of the communication 

197
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:11,880
that was sent out.
If it is something you feel you should,

198
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,560
you should,
should be shared with others.

199
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,603
I only ask that you keep identifiable 
information from my son or myself out 

200
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,210
for our safety.
This is not North Korea for his safety.

201
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,170
I'm sure you understand.
So to conclude,

202
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,770
freedom of speech is everything and I 
should know I come from the Middle East.

203
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:38,460
I escaped that which you don't want to 
have replicate here in Canada.

204
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,630
So no more language police,
no more thought police,

205
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,110
no more echo chambers that sean 
intellectual diversity,

206
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,790
no more identity politics,
no more culture of offense and the ethos

207
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:54,180
of perpetual victimhood.
No micro

208
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,230
aggressions,
no trigger warnings,

209
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,620
no safe spaces and no cultural 
appropriation.

210
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,190
Science reason and logic.
Trump,

211
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,070
trump ideology and feelings.

212
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,660
Thank you very much.
[inaudible]

213
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,520
is it okay to uh,
to move this away please?

214
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,620
Thank you very much.
Good morning.

215
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,693
My thanks to the Manning Center man 
unconference for inviting me to speak 

216
00:12:36,151 --> 00:12:38,310
with you this morning.
And it's a,

217
00:12:38,311 --> 00:12:39,144
it's a great honor to be on the same 
panel with Dr. Jordan Peterson and Dr 

218
00:12:43,231 --> 00:12:44,064
Saad free speech in Canada is not dead,
but at Canadian universities it is 

219
00:12:50,221 --> 00:12:53,140
certainly is on life support.
Uh,

220
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:57,960
each year of the Justice Center releases
the Campus Freedom Index,

221
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,073
uh,
most recently with the new website 

222
00:13:00,091 --> 00:13:05,091
www.campusfreedomindex.ca where you can 
very easily and quickly look up your own

223
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,020
university and see what letter grade a,
b,

224
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:10,854
c,
d,

225
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,270
F has been assigned to your university 
or to your student union.

226
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,420
Uh,
based on its policies,

227
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,263
based on his practices.
We're trying to follow Dr. Michael 

228
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:23,790
Walkers.
Great Dictum if it matters,

229
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,073
measure it.
So annual campus freedom index measures 

230
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,653
with a objective criteria,
the state of free speech at over 60 

231
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:37,260
Canadian universities.

232
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,560
The situation on the whole,
it's,

233
00:13:40,561 --> 00:13:43,260
it's very bad.
There are far more f's handed out.

234
00:13:43,261 --> 00:13:44,094
Then there are a letter grades and the 
Justice Center has been involved with 

235
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,673
uh,
over 12 court actions against 

236
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,640
universities and student unions in four 
provinces.

237
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,553
Fortunately,
we have had some successes a number of 

238
00:13:57,661 --> 00:13:58,494
years ago.
The University of Calgary took it upon 

239
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:01,134
itself to sensor a small pro life group 
on campus and threatened the students 

240
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:07,434
with a trespassing charges and even with
non academic misconduct charges with 

241
00:14:12,781 --> 00:14:13,614
penalties ranging up to expulsion if 
they continue to express their prolife 

242
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:18,254
us on campus.
The students continued with her 

243
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:22,074
expression and they were indeed found 
guilty of non academic misconduct for 

244
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:29,280
having done soul.
Now the penalty was not expulsion,

245
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:30,114
it was a warning,
but we took the university to court and 

246
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:37,320
in 2014 in the case of Wilson versus the
University of Calgary,

247
00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:40,840
we got a court ruling setting aside the,
uh,

248
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:41,723
university of Calgary's decision to find
the students guilty of non academic 

249
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:45,984
misconduct.

250
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:51,980
So that case

251
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,310
is now a precedent that can be used by 
students across Canada.

252
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,480
We also recently,
uh,

253
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,820
this past summer sued the Brandon 
University student union,

254
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:02,654
which had banned a campus prolife club,
which of course is significant because 

255
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:08,420
if you don't have the official club 
status,

256
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:12,480
you cannot participate in clubs day or 
book a table or you,

257
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,730
you cannot on par with the other clubs,
rent out a room or holding events,

258
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,190
uh,
invite a speaker,

259
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,580
hosted debate,
et Cetera.

260
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,193
So we sued the student union at Brandon 
University and before the action got 

261
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:27,014
very far,
they did settle and the re-instate of 

262
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,540
the club.
So another positive result.

263
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,100
But University is a very clever,
so we've got the University of Alberta,

264
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:37,934
which is obviously aware of the 
precedent against the University of 

265
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,463
Calgary.
So rather than censor speech directly 

266
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:48,701
itself with the university does,
is it lets the mob sensor the expression

267
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,800
that is unpopular.
So in 2015,

268
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:52,634
the prolife group put up a,
a peaceful stationary display and there 

269
00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:58,324
was a huge mob of people came with 
sheets and towels and banners and 

270
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:06,830
megaphones and swarmed it and rendered 
it completely impossible to carry on any

271
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:09,710
kind of civil conversation or dialogue 
or debate.

272
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,700
Now,
in spite of the fact that the University

273
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,700
of Alberta's code of student behavior 
expressly prohibits interrupting,

274
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,693
obstructing,
or interfering with university related 

275
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,114
activities and events in spite of very 
clear provisions in the code of student 

276
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:27,734
behavior.
When this disruption and obstruction 

277
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:36,050
took place,
campus security stood by and watched and

278
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:38,450
did nothing to enforce it.
The,

279
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:42,830
on the university's own code of conduct,
the following year,

280
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:44,660
2016,
the students went back,

281
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,573
uh,
filled out a form to have another 

282
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:48,050
display in the university says,
yes,

283
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:48,884
you can,
you can put up a display on campus 

284
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:55,220
provided that you pay us a security fee 
of $17,500.

285
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,620
Now of course,
if you're,

286
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,980
if it's the,
uh,

287
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,470
campus gay pride March,
or if,

288
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:02,304
if it's a feminist or socialist or 
aboriginal or environmentalist 

289
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,823
expression,
there's no security fee is required for 

290
00:17:08,691 --> 00:17:09,524
that.
But if your opinion is unpopular or 

291
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:12,524
controversial,
you're not allowed to express it on 

292
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:18,530
campus unless you pay a security fee of 
$17,500.

293
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,553
So we're suing the University of Alberta
and the court in Edmonton is going to 

294
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:28,181
hear our case coming up in June and it's
going to be hugely,

295
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,390
uh,
for,

296
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,650
for better or for worse.
You know,

297
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,620
you can't predict ahead of time if 
you'll win or lose,

298
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:34,454
but this is going to have a huge impact 
on the rule of law because the message 

299
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,583
that the University of Alberta is 
sending to its own students sim to the 

300
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:47,030
whole world is that if you disagree with
somebody else's opinion,

301
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,770
you should shut them down and silence 
them.

302
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,020
And that's the message,
you know,

303
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:53,220
and it's,
it's tempting,

304
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,270
uh,
you know,

305
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:55,104
for,
for people who disagree with or perhaps 

306
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:02,490
despise or detest the prolife viewpoint,
it's tempting to,

307
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,760
you know,
kind of chuck hole cause you know,

308
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:09,060
this is being shutdown,
but it should be obvious to any thinking

309
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:09,894
person.
If this is the condone trend that's 

310
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:14,214
going to crack in all directions and 
it's not going to be too long before 

311
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:20,580
you're going to see all kinds of views 
and eventually even left wing views,

312
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:21,414
they're going to get shut down by mobs.
If this is not a font immediately and 

313
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:29,730
urgently what to do about the situation.
I've got five recommendations.

314
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:31,980
Firstly,
exercise your free expression.

315
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:34,770
Rights.
Freedom is like a muscle.

316
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,360
If you don't exercise your muscles,
they atrophy and weather and become weak

317
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,370
and useless.
Conversely,

318
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:44,640
if you exercise your muscles,
they stay strong and get even stronger.

319
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:45,474
So exercise your free expression rights.
Do not be intimidated by the name 

320
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:49,380
calling.
We've all heard it.

321
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,640
Racist,
sexist,

322
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:51,900
homophobic,
transphobic,

323
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:53,070
Islamophobic,
et Cetera,

324
00:18:53,071 --> 00:18:55,680
et cetera.
If you self censor,

325
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:00,120
you are giving ground to the enemies of 
freedom and

326
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,983
yeah,

327
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,690
to make a commitment to the idea that 
it's better to die standing them to live

328
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:10,524
on your knees.

329
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,233
Okay,

330
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,823
second point,
come to the defense of others whose 

331
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,730
freedoms are threatened makes a huge 
difference,

332
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,430
especially if it's somebody that you 
disagree with.

333
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,010
Uh,
the Justice Center takes,

334
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,070
uh,
we,

335
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,400
we have taken a position on it.
We're not pro choice,

336
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:34,650
we're not pro life,
but we're pro free speech.

337
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,250
So we take no position on abortion.
As it turns out,

338
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,870
most of our clients on university 
campuses are pro life groups.

339
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,260
We're also acting for the men's Issues 
Awareness Society,

340
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,020
uh,
which is suing the student's Union at a,

341
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,280
at Ryerson University.

342
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,563
I'm,
I'm sad to say that in most of these 

343
00:19:56,621 --> 00:19:57,454
cases,
when a pro life group is getting 

344
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:01,810
censored by the university or by the 
student union,

345
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:05,440
in most cases,
they get no help from the campus.

346
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:07,750
Christian clubs get no help from the 
campus,

347
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:09,310
Jewish campus,
Muslim campus,

348
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:11,800
conservative clubs,
and they're there all alone.

349
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,173
You can make a huge difference if you 
see somebody else being silenced or 

350
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,240
treated unfairly when you speak up.
It's especially powerful if you say,

351
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:21,130
I don't agree with their viewpoint at 
all,

352
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,263
but they have a right to speak their 
opinions in a peaceful fashion on 

353
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:27,424
campus.
And what you're doing with your 

354
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,610
censorship is wrong,
and that's very powerful.

355
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:35,410
So we need to do more of that is speak 
up for others who are being persecuted.

356
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,810
Thirdly,
sign our petition.

357
00:20:37,811 --> 00:20:40,360
No taxpayer funding for universities.
That sensor,

358
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,793
it's high time that universities were 
stopped from perpetrating a fraud on 

359
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:49,084
taxpayers,
which they do by going to the general 

360
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,620
public and to the politicians and 
saying,

361
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:55,930
we believe in academic inquiry.

362
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,660
We believe in freedom of speech.
We believe in frank,

363
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:02,410
honest debate as a tool for reaching 
truth.

364
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,240
And they get $13 billion per year from 
taxpayers,

365
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,083
most of it from provincial governments.
And then they take the 13 billion and 

366
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,910
turnaround and they don't even honor 
their own mission and mandate.

367
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:16,420
And that can be stopped by legislation.
Provincially.

368
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,090
Provinces simply have to amend the 
legislation and say,

369
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,523
universities are not getting money 
unless he uphold free expression on 

370
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:24,430
campus.
So please sign the petition.

371
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,290
There's copies that are,
um,

372
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,690
justice center booth and there's also 
copies in the,

373
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:32,320
in the back of the room.
Fourth Point,

374
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,173
uh,
support the groups that are defending 

375
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,020
the free society.
Uh,

376
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:42,460
don't assume that the organizations out 
there that have their booths up,

377
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:43,091
that,
that,

378
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:44,380
uh,
there's a,

379
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:48,850
there's a few billionaires that are all 
giving these groups $100,000 a year.

380
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,740
Uh,
I know with the Justice Center,

381
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:52,810
and I think it's true for a lot of the 
groups out there,

382
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:58,020
the majority of the money that we get,
it comes in the form of the $200 or $500

383
00:21:58,961 --> 00:22:00,340
$100 donations.

384
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,970
That's 60% of our budget.
So don't,

385
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,850
don't leave it to some imaginary wealthy
person,

386
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:07,684
but step up to the plates and support 
the groups if you're not already doing 

387
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:15,220
so that are defending the free society.
Last but not least,

388
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:16,923
when you yourself are in a situation 
where your fundamental freedoms are 

389
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,230
being violated and whether it's your 
freedom of expression,

390
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,410
your freedom of conscience and religion,
your freedom of association,

391
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,770
stand your ground,
do not be intimidated.

392
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,413
This is really where the war is fought.
Freedom is lost when people cave in and 

393
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:39,730
capitulate on fundamental points of 
principle when they shouldn't.

394
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,230
And I,
I said earlier,

395
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:42,064
it's a,
it's a great honor to be on the same 

396
00:22:43,421 --> 00:22:48,421
panel with Dr. Jordan Peterson.
If more Canadians showed the courage and

397
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:54,160
fortitude that he is demonstrating on a 
daily basis in the face of adversity,

398
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,100
we'd be a lot better country.
Thank you.

399
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,660
[inaudible].

400
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,073
So,
um,

401
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,700
I want to recommend a book first to 
everyone here.

402
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:18,730
It's called explaining postmodernism and
it's by a gentleman named Steven Hicks.

403
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:19,964
And you need to understand postmodernism
because that's what you're up against 

404
00:23:23,961 --> 00:23:27,530
and you're up against it far more than 
you know or think.

405
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,640
And it's a much more well developed and 
uh,

406
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,320
pervasive,
pernicious,

407
00:23:33,321 --> 00:23:34,154
nihilistic,
intellectually attractive doctrine then 

408
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,133
has yet come to public realization had 
absolutely dominates the humanities and 

409
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,650
increasingly the social sciences in the 
universities.

410
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:47,780
And what's happening,
you see,

411
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,810
someone once said,
who unfortunately I can't remember,

412
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:51,644
it might've been Friedrich Nietzsche 
said that everybody is the unconscious 

413
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:56,960
exponent of a dead philosopher.
And,

414
00:23:56,961 --> 00:23:59,240
uh,
fortunately the postmodern philosophers,

415
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:01,220
most of them are dead.
So that's a good thing.

416
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,593
But that doesn't mean that their words 
aren't continually being spoken by 

417
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:07,730
people who,
who are following in their wake,

418
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:08,564
let's say.
And it's not like any given person is 

419
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:13,430
absolutely possessed and say by the 
spirit of postmodernism,

420
00:24:13,431 --> 00:24:14,264
because often they're not educated 
enough to know all the details about 

421
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:18,740
what it is that has them in their grip.

422
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,323
But if you get 20 of them together and 
they're all 5% influenced by the 

423
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:26,810
postmodernist ethos,
you basically have the spirit of the mob

424
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,020
that's a mouthpiece for that particular 
philosophical doctrine.

425
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,123
And if you understand the doctrine,
then you understand why things are 

426
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,110
progressing the way that they are 
progressing.

427
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:38,480
And so I'm going to tell you a little 
bit about the doctrine,

428
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:39,883
um,
because it's not optional to understand 

429
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:42,434
this.
It's absolutely crucial to understand 

430
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:45,134
this,
huh?

431
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,430
You can't underestimate the power of 
ideas and,

432
00:24:48,431 --> 00:24:52,070
and also the power of words of course,
because ideas are expressed in words,

433
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:52,904
but you see the postmodernists 
completely reject the structure of 

434
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:59,570
Western civilization.
And I mean completely.

435
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:01,490
So I can give you an example in one 
term,

436
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,473
Jacques Derrida whose head trickster for
the postmodernist movement regarded 

437
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,393
Western culture,
let's call it the patriarchy as fellow 

438
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,180
go centric.
Okay.

439
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:13,580
So fallow comes from Phallus,
p,

440
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:14,301
h a,
l,

441
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:15,134
l,
o.

442
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,973
And so that's the insistence that what 
you see in Western culture is the 

443
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:21,680
consequence of a male dominated,
oppressive,

444
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,410
um,
self serving society.

445
00:25:24,411 --> 00:25:25,730
And we might say,
well,

446
00:25:25,731 --> 00:25:28,130
you know,
societies do tend to be self serving and

447
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,310
people in power do tend to act in their 
best interests,

448
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:32,144
but a tendency is not an absolute.
And that's one of the things that needs 

449
00:25:35,691 --> 00:25:36,524
to be considered continually.
There are no shortage of flaws in the 

450
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:41,780
manner in which we've structured our 
society.

451
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,430
And compared to any hypothetical utopia,
it's an absolutely dismal wreck.

452
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,293
But compared to the rest of the world 
and the plight of other societies 

453
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:51,194
throughout the history of mankind,
we're doing pretty damn well and we 

454
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,610
should be happy to be living in the 
society that we're living in.

455
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,180
Yeah.
So the first

456
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,043
thing that you might want to note about 
postmodernism is that it doesn't have a 

457
00:26:03,181 --> 00:26:04,014
shred of gratitude.
And there's something pathologically 

458
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:08,350
wrong with a person who does have,
it,

459
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:11,550
doesn't have any gratitude,
especially when they live in what so far

460
00:26:11,551 --> 00:26:12,384
is the best of all possible worlds.
And so if you're not great for your 

461
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,253
driven by resentment and resentment,
is the boat the worst emotion that you 

462
00:26:18,931 --> 00:26:21,330
can possibly experience apart from 
arrogancy,

463
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,710
resentment,
arrogance,

464
00:26:22,711 --> 00:26:25,470
and deceit.
There's an evil triad for you,

465
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:28,230
and if you're bitter about everything 
that's happening around you,

466
00:26:28,231 --> 00:26:30,390
despite the fact that you're bathed in 
wealth,

467
00:26:30,391 --> 00:26:32,040
then there's something absolutely wrong 
with you.

468
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:34,140
You know,
the black community in the United States

469
00:26:34,141 --> 00:26:38,790
is the 18th wealthiest community,
18th wealthiest nation on the planet.

470
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,043
Now,
that doesn't mean there isn't such a 

471
00:26:40,561 --> 00:26:42,720
thing as relative poverty in relative 
poverty.

472
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,333
It's an important,
it's an important political economic 

473
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:46,861
issue,
and it's very,

474
00:26:46,861 --> 00:26:48,060
very difficult to deal with.

475
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,193
But absolute wealth matters too.
And the western societies have been 

476
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:55,080
absolutely remarkable in their ability 
to generate and distribute wealth.

477
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,830
As you can tell by just looking around 
and taking a,

478
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,943
you know,
a brief bit of consideration for the 

479
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:02,730
absolute miracle that even a building 
like this represents.

480
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,490
So you have to educate yourself about 
postmodernism.

481
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:06,324
Okay?
So here's what the postmodernists 

482
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:09,450
belief.
They don't believe in the individual.

483
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,403
That's the logos park.
Western culture is fell logo centric 

484
00:27:13,351 --> 00:27:16,500
logo is logos.
That's partly the Christian word,

485
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,840
but it's also partly the root word of 
logic,

486
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,420
okay?
They don't believe in logic.

487
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,433
They believe that logic is part of the 
process by which the patriarchal 

488
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:30,240
institutions of the West continue to 
dominate and to justify their dominance.

489
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,230
They don't believe in dialogue.
The root word of dialogue is logos.

490
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,103
Again,
they don't believe that people of 

491
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:40,950
goodwill can come to consensus through 
the x through the exchange of ideas.

492
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,053
They believe that that notion is part of
the philosophical substructure and 

493
00:27:46,261 --> 00:27:47,094
practices of the dominant culture.
So the reason they don't let people who 

494
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:50,664
they don't agree with speak on campuses 
because they don't agree with letting 

495
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:55,410
people speak.
You see?

496
00:27:55,411 --> 00:27:57,720
It's not part of the ethos.
Okay,

497
00:27:57,721 --> 00:27:59,820
so what else do they believe and not 
believe?

498
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,193
They believe that you,
since you don't have an individual 

499
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:03,474
identity,
your fundamental identity is group 

500
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:05,754
fostered.
And that means that you're basically an 

501
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:10,620
exemplar of your race,
hanse white privilege,

502
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,250
or you're an exemplar of your gender or 
your sex or your ethnicity,

503
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:18,730
or your an exemplar of however you can 
be classified so that you,

504
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:23,160
you are placed in the position of victim
against the oppressor.

505
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,830
Because that's the game and it's,
it's,

506
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,290
it's a post Marxist sleight of hand,
right?

507
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,124
The old Marxist notion was that the 
world was a battleground between the 

508
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:34,080
burrs,
waze and the proletariat.

509
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:39,470
And that a failed to have any 
philosophical or ethical standing.

510
00:28:40,111 --> 00:28:40,944
That argument after the working class 
actually saw its standard of living 

511
00:28:44,311 --> 00:28:48,630
massively elevated as a consequence of 
of Western corporate democracy,

512
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:53,160
a Western free enterprise democracy and 
also b.

513
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,023
And and also as a consequence of the 
revelations of everything terrible that 

514
00:28:56,791 --> 00:29:00,810
it happened in every bloody country that
ever dared to make equity.

515
00:29:00,811 --> 00:29:01,644
And,
and the Marxist communist dogma part of 

516
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:06,090
their fundamental structure,
right.

517
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:08,340
And nothing but murderousness and 
oppression.

518
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:12,840
And so by the 1970s it was evident that 
that game was up the postmark,

519
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:13,674
the postmodernist Marxist just barely 
basically pulled a sleight of hand and 

520
00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:16,981
said,
okay,

521
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:17,814
if it's not the poor against the rich,
it's the oppressed against the 

522
00:29:20,641 --> 00:29:21,740
oppressor.
We'll just read,

523
00:29:21,741 --> 00:29:24,660
divide the subpopulations in ways that 
make our,

524
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,750
our bloody philosophy continuing its in 
its,

525
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:30,570
in its movement forward.
And that's where we're at now.

526
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,920
And so for the postmodernists,
the world is a hobbsy in battleground of

527
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:37,890
identity groups.
They do not communicate with one another

528
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,320
because they can't.
All there is is a struggle for power.

529
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,350
And if you're in the Predator group,
which means you're an oppressor,

530
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:47,170
then you better look out because you're 
not exactly welcome.

531
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,840
Ah,
not exactly welcome and neither are your

532
00:29:49,841 --> 00:29:52,450
ideas.
So that's what you're up against.

533
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,463
I would say it's time for conservatives 
to stop apologizing for being 

534
00:29:55,931 --> 00:29:57,570
conservatives.
You know,

535
00:29:57,571 --> 00:29:58,404
and

536
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,220
you don't apologize to these people.
That's a big mistake.

537
00:30:07,221 --> 00:30:09,530
Apology there.
They read apology as a,

538
00:30:09,531 --> 00:30:11,450
as a,
as an admission of guilt.

539
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,670
You don't apologize and you don't back 
down.

540
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,550
You young people that are out there who 
are university students,

541
00:30:16,551 --> 00:30:18,350
you need to take over the student 
unions,

542
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,273
you need to take them back because 
they're absolute snake pits and they 

543
00:30:21,201 --> 00:30:22,190
haven't been since the [inaudible].

544
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,510
No.

545
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,280
And with regards with regards to the 
universities,

546
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:31,114
I thought at one point that the best 
thing to do would be to cut their 

547
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:33,634
funding by 25% let them fight amongst 
themselves for the remnants because it 

548
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:40,450
would force the universities to decide 
exactly what's important and what isn't.

549
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,643
So I would say the humanities and much 
of the social sciences have has turned 

550
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:47,680
into a postmodern Neil Marxists 
playground for radicals.

551
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,663
The scholarship is terrible.
80% of humanities papers aren't cited 

552
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:53,560
once,
once.

553
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,573
And so what that means is that they 
write papers for each other and they 

554
00:30:56,741 --> 00:30:59,230
sell them to libraries.
And that's how the publishers make their

555
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:00,064
money and no one reads them.
But the publishers can print them 

556
00:31:01,631 --> 00:31:02,464
because the libraries have to buy them 
and they're buying them with your tax 

557
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:05,584
money.
And so all of you who are sitting here 

558
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:12,150
are funding and our postmodern radical 
neo Marxist agenda that has its roots in

559
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:15,280
the university and your tax money is 
going towards that.

560
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,323
And if you want proof of that,
you just go online and look at the 

561
00:31:18,641 --> 00:31:19,474
websites,
especially of of disciplines like 

562
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:22,750
women's studies,
which is pathological,

563
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:23,584
right?
To the core.

564
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,760
But it's not just women's studies,
it's all the ethnic studies group,

565
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,340
it's anthropology,
it's sociology,

566
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,203
it's social work.
And most of all it's education and 

567
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:36,990
noisy,
for example,

568
00:31:36,991 --> 00:31:40,560
in Ontario is perhaps apart from the 
Ontario Human Rights Commission,

569
00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:42,540
the most dangerous institution in 
Canada.

570
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,640
It should be defunded.
It's as simple as that.

571
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,710
They don't do the research they purport 
to do.

572
00:31:51,711 --> 00:31:53,020
They're not interested in,
in,

573
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,800
in,
at all in education.

574
00:31:54,801 --> 00:31:59,150
They're interested in the indoctrination
of people as young as they can fund a as

575
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:01,760
young as they can get their hands on,
so to speak.

576
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:02,923
Now we need to figure out,
our society needs to figure out how to 

577
00:32:05,241 --> 00:32:09,800
stop shunting public tax money to 
radical left wing activists.

578
00:32:09,801 --> 00:32:12,260
If we were doing that for radical right 
wing activists there,

579
00:32:12,261 --> 00:32:13,094
it'd be an absolute storm.
But it's happened incrementally since 

580
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:19,150
the 1960s and it needs to stop.
So that's,

581
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,970
that's partly what the Conservatives,
not only conservatives,

582
00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:23,804
but also liberals,
true liberals in the English sands are 

583
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:26,990
up against.
I mean,

584
00:32:26,991 --> 00:32:30,860
what's happened as also as a consequence
of this postmodern,

585
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:34,790
neo Marxist intellectual invasion,
is that the center keeps moving.

586
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,700
It's moved way to the right now.
So if you're a classic liberal,

587
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:40,820
you've become a conservative.
And so for all of you who are interested

588
00:32:40,821 --> 00:32:41,654
in pursuing the conservative agenda,
there's a lot of classic liberals that 

589
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:46,850
you could be talking to.
And then finally,

590
00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:47,684
with regards to talking to young people,
you finally have something to sell to 

591
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:50,750
them.
You know,

592
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,930
it's not easy to sell conservatism to 
young people because they want to change

593
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:54,764
things.
And that's not what conservatives want 

594
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:57,680
to do.
They want to maintain things.

595
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,080
Well now you've got something to sell to
young people.

596
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:05,120
You can sell them freedom of speech and 
you can tell sell them responsibility.

597
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,280
The left is selling them,
right?

598
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,383
You can sell them responsibility.
And I can tell you because I received 

599
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:13,790
many letters of the sort that,
that God was talking about,

600
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,863
young people are absolutely starving for
someone to provide them with a sense of 

601
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:19,220
responsibility and say,
look,

602
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:20,950
here's something worth living for,
man.

603
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,690
[inaudible]

604
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,413
you know,
you can find meaning in life with 

605
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:29,400
freedom,
but freedom.

606
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,590
Freedom is a chaotic sort of meaning,
right?

607
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:33,120
And,
and freedom isn't the sort of thing that

608
00:33:33,121 --> 00:33:35,520
makes people happy.
It's the sort of thing that makes people

609
00:33:35,521 --> 00:33:37,110
troublesome.
Troubled because,

610
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,470
um,
freedom expands your,

611
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,160
you're a series of choices and that 
makes you nervous and uncertain.

612
00:33:44,161 --> 00:33:46,620
So,
but responsibility is another.

613
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,410
Not to say that that's a bad thing.
It's a good thing,

614
00:33:49,411 --> 00:33:49,890
but it,
it,

615
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:50,723
it requires that you,
that you shoulder the responsibility of 

616
00:33:53,941 --> 00:33:54,774
the freedom.
But responsibility per se is what gives 

617
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,970
your life meaning genuine meaning in the
face of suffering.

618
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,450
And you and young people are really,
they're starving for that.

619
00:34:03,451 --> 00:34:06,540
I've been teaching young people for 30 
years and mostly what I've been teaching

620
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:07,374
them about his responsibility,
it's like your errors to a great 

621
00:34:10,351 --> 00:34:13,170
tradition.
It's not perfect obviously,

622
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,410
but comparatively,
you know,

623
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,130
there's nothing else like it that's ever
been produced and it's,

624
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,660
it,
it represents a tiny minority of,

625
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:21,371
of,
of,

626
00:34:21,371 --> 00:34:23,640
of the human politics,
most of which are,

627
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:24,810
are,
are,

628
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,490
are run by murderous,
antisocial,

629
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,070
psychopathic,
um,

630
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:31,420
uh,
thugs and that,

631
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,740
that's seriously.
And so what kind of alternative is that?

632
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:38,100
We've got this beacon of freedom and 
wealth in the West that works,

633
00:34:38,101 --> 00:34:40,980
although it doesn't work perfectly.
And one of the,

634
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,730
one of the responsibilities of young 
people is to find out what's at the core

635
00:34:44,731 --> 00:34:46,170
of that.
The great,

636
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:48,600
great core of that,
that the paramount,

637
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:52,650
the paramount importance of the 
individual and the divinity of speech.

638
00:34:52,651 --> 00:34:54,300
Man,
that's some to sell.

639
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,640
It's what our whole culture is 
predicated on.

640
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,960
All right,

641
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,873
well I should start there.
So thank you very much for the 

642
00:35:04,261 --> 00:35:05,094
invitation.

643
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,050
So

644
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,760
thank you very much to all of our 
speakers.

645
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,830
Really insightful comments.
Um,

646
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,440
I'm just going to lead a better 20 
minute discussion,

647
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,360
15 minute discussion.
Um,

648
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,750
and my first question is the direction 
in which we're going.

649
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:26,720
So,
um,

650
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:29,730
there was a pool that was published by 
the Economist and uh,

651
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,593
I think tuition is ago that showed the,
the support among young people for 

652
00:35:35,621 --> 00:35:38,490
different sets of rights in different 
countries across the world.

653
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:39,623
And they found that support for the 
expansion of rights that are considered 

654
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:45,630
rights for historically marginalized 
groups.

655
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,910
So the right for women's equality,
um,

656
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,510
right to same sex marriage,
Rachel abortion,

657
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:54,240
things like that.
Even in countries where those rights are

658
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:59,241
not in trying in law has incredible 
amounts of support among young people.

659
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:02,970
The only exception is the right to free 
speech,

660
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,893
particularly the right to speech that 
may be perceived as offensive to 

661
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:12,570
minority groups in that category.
Countries like Britain,

662
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,050
Germany and Canada,
the support among young people for that,

663
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:20,670
right?
It's under 50% so right now we have,

664
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,560
um,
we see,

665
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,543
we see censorship,
self censorship and real state 

666
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:28,860
censorship by people who actually hold 
the,

667
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,240
the leavers of power in government and 
in institutions.

668
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,373
But when these people who right now have
less than 50% support for the right to 

669
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:39,144
free speech are 15 years from now,
the ones holding those leavers and 

670
00:36:42,211 --> 00:36:43,770
power,
where do you see this going?

671
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,360
Well,
the,

672
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,640
the short term future is very bleak,
but I,

673
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:51,723
I always say you just got to keep on 
fighting for what is right and 

674
00:36:56,410 --> 00:37:01,410
exercising courage and we can't see what
the medium term or long term future is.

675
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,050
Uh,
you know,

676
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,280
the history is,
is,

677
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:10,150
is quite unpredictable,
but the short term trends are terrible.

678
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,263
Uh,
I think another thing for people in the 

679
00:37:13,961 --> 00:37:14,794
audience who are parents is you don't 
get your kids out of the public 

680
00:37:17,651 --> 00:37:19,540
education system.
And,

681
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:20,374
uh,
do homeschooling or private school make 

682
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:23,890
that a priority.
You know,

683
00:37:23,891 --> 00:37:24,724
even if you can't afford it,
figure out a way because this 

684
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:32,100
indoctrination into these postmodernist 
or neo Marxist type ideas,

685
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,400
it just permeates the whole,
uh,

686
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,000
curriculum.
Whether it's math,

687
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:38,290
science,
social studies,

688
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:41,050
what have you.
So that's something practical.

689
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,880
Uh,
certainly the,

690
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,490
the students that are now 18,
19,

691
00:37:45,491 --> 00:37:48,370
20,
it's obvious that in high school they've

692
00:37:48,371 --> 00:37:52,750
never been taught that if there's an 
idea that you disagree with,

693
00:37:52,751 --> 00:37:53,584
while you had come up with reasons why 
that's wrong and you try to use facts 

694
00:37:57,191 --> 00:38:00,320
and logic to engage in discussion,
that's a,

695
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,233
you know,
it,

696
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,280
they've got these mobs as,
you know,

697
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:07,600
what I feel very offended by by what you
said,

698
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:10,360
I feel that way and therefore you 
shouldn't be allowed to say it.

699
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,640
What were they getting that from?
I mean,

700
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,000
that's coming out of the K to 12 
education system.

701
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:18,623
Yeah.
Great.

702
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:24,190
One of the things that I tried to do is 
to convince both colleagues and students

703
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:27,040
and anybody who's willing to listen to 
participate,

704
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:29,860
participate in the trench warfare.
I'm ideas.

705
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:33,700
Many people feel as though they don't 
have the necessary platform,

706
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:36,250
unnecessary testicular

707
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,083
fortitude to actually battle.
But then they see gentlemen like Jordan 

708
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:44,200
Peterson,
if I may include myself and a few others

709
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,920
who are on the front lines and then they
feel very invigorated.

710
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:52,540
So the,
I think the ship can be turned around as

711
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:53,374
long as people feel sufficiently 
empowered that they actually have a 

712
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:56,794
voice.
You could wait in simply on your 

713
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:00,184
facebook page.
You could weigh in at the bar when 

714
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:02,614
speaking to someone,
everybody has a voice and everybody 

715
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:05,524
should feel sufficiently invigorated and
the possibility of lending their voice 

716
00:39:09,551 --> 00:39:11,170
to the debate.
And if we can do that,

717
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,150
then I don't think we need to be 
pessimistic.

718
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:13,984
If we can't convince people to do that,
then I think it will be an infinite 

719
00:39:17,051 --> 00:39:20,530
abyss of darkness.
So you know,

720
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,663
one way of conceptualizing yourself is 
that your one speck of dust among 7 

721
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,870
billion.
And when you conceptualize yourself that

722
00:39:28,871 --> 00:39:29,621
way,
you might think,

723
00:39:29,621 --> 00:39:30,790
well,
what difference does it make?

724
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:31,623
What I say or do?
And that it's actually quite convenient 

725
00:39:33,461 --> 00:39:34,294
for you.
Because if it doesn't matter what you 

726
00:39:35,471 --> 00:39:37,660
say or do,
then you don't have any responsibility.

727
00:39:37,661 --> 00:39:40,450
And you can do whatever you want,
the price you pay for that.

728
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:41,284
It's a bit of nihilism.
But if you don't have to shoulder any 

729
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:46,420
responsibility,
that's a small price to pay another.

730
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,300
That's the underground motivation for 
nihilism.

731
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:52,690
But the other way of looking at it,
and this is actually the accurate way of

732
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:54,790
looking at it,
is that you're in a network,

733
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,863
you're a node in a network,
and so you can do a little bit of 

734
00:39:57,971 --> 00:40:01,540
arithmetic very rapidly and just 
figuring out how powerful you are.

735
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:05,440
You know a thousand people,
you're going to know more than that over

736
00:40:05,441 --> 00:40:07,810
the course of your life,
but let's say a thousand for the sake of

737
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:10,390
argument.
For now they know a thousand people.

738
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,493
That means that you're one person away 
from a million people and two persons 

739
00:40:14,351 --> 00:40:17,980
away from a billion people and you're 
the center of that network.

740
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:18,814
And now the way networks work is that 
information propagates in a network 

741
00:40:21,491 --> 00:40:24,940
manner.
So don't underestimate the power of your

742
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:26,380
speech.
Now,

743
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:29,290
you know,
western culture is fell logo centric.

744
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:30,130
Let's say it.
Okay?

745
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:30,941
So we'll say,
yeah,

746
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:32,800
that's just fine.
That's exactly what it is.

747
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,680
It's predicated on the idea of the 
logos,

748
00:40:34,681 --> 00:40:38,200
that the logos is the sacred element of 
Western culture.

749
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,213
And what does that mean?
It means that your capacity for speech 

750
00:40:41,691 --> 00:40:44,800
is divine.
It's the thing that generates order from

751
00:40:44,801 --> 00:40:45,634
chaos and then sometimes turns 
pathological order into chaos when it 

752
00:40:48,491 --> 00:40:51,640
has to.
Don't underestimate the power of truth.

753
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:52,683
There's nothing more powerful.
Now in order to speak what you might 

754
00:40:56,231 --> 00:40:59,230
regard as the truth,
you have to let go of the outcome.

755
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,330
You have to think,
all right,

756
00:41:01,331 --> 00:41:04,570
I'm going to say what I think stupid as 
I am biased,

757
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:05,404
as I am ignorant as I am,
I'm going to state what I think as 

758
00:41:08,771 --> 00:41:09,604
clearly as I can and I'm going to live 
with the consequences no matter what 

759
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:14,404
they are.
Now the reason you think that that's an 

760
00:41:16,901 --> 00:41:20,350
element of faith,
the idea is that nothing brings a better

761
00:41:20,351 --> 00:41:21,184
world into being then misstated truth.
Now you might have to pay a price for 

762
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:26,410
that,
but that's fine.

763
00:41:26,411 --> 00:41:27,244
You're going to pay a price for every 
bloody thing you do and everything you 

764
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:30,904
don't do.
You don't get to choose to not pay a 

765
00:41:32,651 --> 00:41:33,484
price.
You get to choose which poison you're 

766
00:41:35,391 --> 00:41:37,370
going to take.
That's it.

767
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,040
So if you're going to stand up for 
something,

768
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:41,480
stand up for your truth,
it'll,

769
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,343
it'll shape you because people will 
respond and object and tell you why you 

770
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:48,020
a fool and a biased moron,
why you're ignorant.

771
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:52,250
And then if you listen to them,
you'll be just that much less like that.

772
00:41:52,251 --> 00:41:55,430
The next time you say something and if 
you do that for five years,

773
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:56,563
you'll be so damn tough and articulate 
and able to communicate and withstand 

774
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:02,060
pressure that you won't even recognize 
yourself.

775
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,320
And then you'll be a force to contend 
with and you don't get to wait until,

776
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:07,283
because I get letters like Gad,
Saad gets all the time too from to 

777
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,870
members in particular and they say,
well,

778
00:42:11,871 --> 00:42:14,880
you know,
when I get tenure slight,

779
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:15,890
then they think,
well,

780
00:42:15,891 --> 00:42:18,110
when I'm an associate professor,
and then they think,

781
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:19,610
well,
when I'm a full professor,

782
00:42:19,611 --> 00:42:24,170
it's like if you're a professor already,
you're like the most protected person in

783
00:42:24,171 --> 00:42:25,880
the history of the planet.
You know,

784
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:26,390
and,
and you,

785
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:27,223
you,
you need,

786
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,100
well,
okay,

787
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:30,290
but what,
one of the things that that indicates is

788
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:33,840
that it's almost impossible to provide 
people with enough protection.

789
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,110
So that they feel safe to speak.
Okay,

790
00:42:36,111 --> 00:42:36,944
so we'll address that directly.
It is not safe to speak and it never 

791
00:42:41,751 --> 00:42:42,980
will be,
but the,

792
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:47,660
the thing you got to keep in mind is 
that it's even less safe not to speak,

793
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,730
right?
It's a balance of risks.

794
00:42:49,731 --> 00:42:50,564
It's like you want to,
you want to pay the price for being who 

795
00:42:52,431 --> 00:42:55,100
you are and stating your mode of being 
in the world.

796
00:42:55,101 --> 00:42:55,934
Or do you want to pay the price for 
being a bloody surf one that's enslaved 

797
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:02,210
him or herself?
Well,

798
00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:03,044
that's a major price man.
That thing unfolds over decades and 

799
00:43:05,301 --> 00:43:09,290
you'll just be miserable worm at the end
of about 20 years of that,

800
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:11,000
right?
No self respect,

801
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:14,360
no power,
no ability to voice your opinions,

802
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:18,500
nothing left but resentment because 
everyone's against you because of course

803
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:23,501
you've never stood up for yourself.
It's like say what you think carefully.

804
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,030
Pay attention to your words,
the prices.

805
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:29,660
It's a price you want to pay.
If you are willing to believe that truth

806
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:34,370
is the cornerstone of society.
And in the most real sense,

807
00:43:34,371 --> 00:43:35,001
if you're,
if you,

808
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:39,110
if you're willing to take that leap,
then tell the truth and see what happens

809
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:41,630
and nothing better could possibly happen
to you.

810
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:42,973
There'll be ups and downs and there'll 
be pushback and there'll be controversy 

811
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:47,930
in all of that.
But it doesn't matter.

812
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,793
The truth is what makes the world the 
truth is what redeems the world from 

813
00:43:53,361 --> 00:43:55,700
Hell.
And that's the truth.

814
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,640
And we saw plenty of hell for the last 
hundred years,

815
00:43:58,641 --> 00:43:59,474
you know,
and we haven't learned a bloody thing 

816
00:44:00,651 --> 00:44:02,840
from it.
It's like wake up,

817
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:05,450
tell the truth,
tell the truth,

818
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:08,990
or at least don't lie.
If that's a start and you go,

819
00:44:08,991 --> 00:44:11,750
you gotta understand that's a risk.
But I will,

820
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,680
one more brief thing to say about that.
Um,

821
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:16,760
so,
you know,

822
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:21,050
I said what I had to say back in 
September and I'm sure that I could have

823
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:21,884
done it better.
And many people have told me how I 

824
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:23,954
could've done it better,
although it didn't mean they would 

825
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,300
actually do it.
Yeah.

826
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:28,500
But,
but,

827
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,920
and you know,
my job was at risk,

828
00:44:35,921 --> 00:44:36,754
serious risk for about two months and 
these stabilized my family been very 

829
00:44:39,701 --> 00:44:42,670
brains about this.
So like thumbs up to their mandate

830
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,080
just stood by him.
But the OP,

831
00:44:47,081 --> 00:44:48,070
here's the optimist

832
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,630
stick news is the university has left me
alone completely.

833
00:44:50,631 --> 00:44:52,370
I shook hands with the dean two weeks 
ago.

834
00:44:52,371 --> 00:44:53,204
We're on friendly terms.
They don't want this to go any farther 

835
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:55,874
than it has already.
The students were tremendously 

836
00:44:57,231 --> 00:44:59,210
welcoming.
When I came back to teach in January,

837
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,193
I haven't had a single negative incident
at the university and I've received 

838
00:45:02,961 --> 00:45:05,660
thousands of letters from people all 
over the world,

839
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:09,920
all of which have been in support.
I've received two negative letters.

840
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:15,070
That's it to the people.
People have it in Kuwait,

841
00:45:15,651 --> 00:45:19,070
longing to have the sort of thing that 
we're talking about articulated.

842
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:23,720
And so don't be thinking you're alone.
It's just that people can't talk,

843
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,970
they're afraid to talk or they don't 
know what to say.

844
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,830
And,
and those are real problems.

845
00:45:27,831 --> 00:45:28,664
So if you're reasonably articulate,
like start talking and sharpen yourself 

846
00:45:32,661 --> 00:45:34,400
up.
I mean the enemy is,

847
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,590
is a cloud.
Their cloud is nat.

848
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,470
They're only courageous in groups.
They're only courageous.

849
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:40,304
And moms,
if you stand your ground and don't 

850
00:45:42,081 --> 00:45:44,180
apologize and articulate things 
properly,

851
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,360
they'll disperse around you.
Like they're not even there.

852
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:52,070
So most of it's illusion.
So don't be be afraid,

853
00:45:52,071 --> 00:45:54,740
but be afraid of the right thing.
And the right thing you should be afraid

854
00:45:54,741 --> 00:45:58,520
of is not saying what you say.
Cause that's the same as not being.

855
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:03,470
And here you are suffering away.
You might as well be at the same time,

856
00:46:03,471 --> 00:46:06,140
at least then there's something to you.
So,

857
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:13,923
so

858
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:14,903
one of the other things I wanted to ask 
your opinion about is what rule do 

859
00:46:17,911 --> 00:46:21,240
provocateurs play in the debate over 
free speech?

860
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:22,074
So,
uh,

861
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,380
the example of the day is,
is obviously Milo Yiannopoulos.

862
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:29,100
Um,
are these champions of free speech or do

863
00:46:29,101 --> 00:46:34,080
they undermine public support for the 
right or are they simply self interested

864
00:46:34,081 --> 00:46:34,914
people who are hijacking a right in 
order to promote themselves and their 

865
00:46:38,461 --> 00:46:40,140
own interests?
Um,

866
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:44,220
and obviously is this a new phenomenon 
or is this something that is,

867
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:45,600
is,
is age.

868
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:51,050
They're all of those.
Marlowe is a classic example.

869
00:46:51,051 --> 00:46:52,760
He's an amazing person.
I mean,

870
00:46:52,761 --> 00:46:54,380
he's,
he's a contradiction.

871
00:46:54,381 --> 00:46:57,080
He's a walking contradiction.
You can't pin that guy down,

872
00:46:57,081 --> 00:46:57,531
right?
Like,

873
00:46:57,531 --> 00:47:00,170
what is he half Jewish,
half English gay,

874
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,670
uh,
Catholic,

875
00:47:01,671 --> 00:47:03,410
provocateur Catholic.
Who's,

876
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:04,760
who's,
who's really,

877
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:05,721
who's really,
yeah.

878
00:47:05,721 --> 00:47:08,630
Who loves black guys and who,
who,

879
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:11,270
who is it?
Who Appeals to American Republicans?

880
00:47:11,271 --> 00:47:12,104
It's like,
what are you going to say about 

881
00:47:13,611 --> 00:47:14,990
something?
Somebody like that.

882
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,580
It's like he's a,
he's a,

883
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:19,010
he's a trickster figure.
Archetypically speaking,

884
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:19,903
you know,
and he's,

885
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:23,780
he's a provocateur and a comedian.
And the funny thing about Comedians,

886
00:47:23,781 --> 00:47:25,520
they're like gestures in the king's 
court.

887
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:26,563
The gesture was the only person who 
could tell the truth because he was 

888
00:47:28,371 --> 00:47:29,204
beneath contempt.
And that's the role that comedians and 

889
00:47:31,931 --> 00:47:33,880
provocateurs play.
They're poking,

890
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:37,750
they're poking and laughing and making 
fun and you know,

891
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,760
Milo Christ,
even dresses like,

892
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:41,550
what do you call those?

893
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:43,270
A Harlequin,
you know,

894
00:47:43,271 --> 00:47:46,960
he's a trickster and trickster figures,
emergent times of crisis.

895
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,070
And they point out what no one wants to 
see and they say things that no one will

896
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:51,904
say.
You can say all the terrible things 

897
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:54,580
about him.
He is a provocateur,

898
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:55,950
he's an EGOMANIAC,
he's a,

899
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:00,400
I don't think he's narcissistic,
but because he has the real capacity for

900
00:48:00,401 --> 00:48:01,960
self reflection,
but,

901
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:04,780
and he's brave as can be.
I mean,

902
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:08,590
and,
and he's unstoppable on his feet.

903
00:48:08,591 --> 00:48:10,960
He just amazes me.
I've never seen anyone ever,

904
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:11,794
I don't think,
and I've met some pretty damn smart 

905
00:48:12,971 --> 00:48:13,804
people.
I've never seen anyone who can take on 

906
00:48:15,941 --> 00:48:18,040
an onslaught of criticism and reverse 
it.

907
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:19,900
Like he county.
It's bloody amazing.

908
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,970
But he is all those things you 
described,

909
00:48:21,971 --> 00:48:26,971
but you know the times call forth us the
speakers and we've called Forth Milo.

910
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,533
Yeah,
well then that tells you what our times 

911
00:48:31,561 --> 00:48:35,220
are.
Milo's been on my show and he's supposed

912
00:48:35,221 --> 00:48:37,050
to come against him.
He's at,

913
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:40,740
he's exactly the things that Jordan said
at times.

914
00:48:40,741 --> 00:48:43,770
He,
he has an ability to depart from truth.

915
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,690
You're speaking to shy.
So for example,

916
00:48:45,691 --> 00:48:48,840
when he says things like,
there is no such thing as lesbians.

917
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:51,683
I appreciate his provocateur nature.
But then it'd be nice to stay closer to 

918
00:48:56,461 --> 00:48:57,294
the truth.
But to the extent that he is getting a 

919
00:48:58,771 --> 00:49:03,150
lot of young people engaged probably 
more than Jordan and I could,

920
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,573
you know,
in our lifetimes a lot of people are 

921
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:09,450
associating to him and so as a central 
message is truly important.

922
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:13,440
So even if once in a while he makes a 
departure from truth,

923
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,970
our grant him that because his greater,
uh,

924
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,920
his own death is quite important.
So I certainly support them.

925
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:24,160
Oh,
just add that a is the so called extreme

926
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:25,263
speech that pushes the envelope and that
ends up in the long run being 

927
00:49:29,531 --> 00:49:34,531
fundamentally transformative.
W The top question ask always is,

928
00:49:35,591 --> 00:49:36,424
you know,
is it true or to what extent is a true 

929
00:49:38,171 --> 00:49:39,004
or why is it not true?
Truth is always the thing too to think 

930
00:49:41,471 --> 00:49:42,304
about.
We should never be concerned with 

931
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:46,720
whether something is quote extreme or 
not.

932
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,680
Cause that changes from year to year,
from decade to decade.

933
00:49:50,681 --> 00:49:51,850
I mean you think,
you know,

934
00:49:51,851 --> 00:49:56,851
in 1969 it would have been extreme to 
advocate for gay marriage.

935
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:01,240
That would have been an extreme position
with less than 1% support.

936
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:02,403
And today in many quarters is considered
extreme to say that gay marriage is a 

937
00:50:06,101 --> 00:50:08,660
bad thing.
So extremism changes from,

938
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:10,300
from year to year,
decade to decade,

939
00:50:10,301 --> 00:50:11,134
month to month.
And it should never be a criteria for 

940
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:16,360
your speed is an extreme or nuts.
That's not the right question.

941
00:50:16,361 --> 00:50:17,710
The question,
is it true or false?

942
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,800
Is it right or wrong?
Those are the questions to ask.

943
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:22,260
Okay.

944
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,630
Um,
really quickly,

945
00:50:23,631 --> 00:50:25,460
one final question.
Um,

946
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,950
part of the debate that we have,

947
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,113
uh,
when we talk about free speech is in 

948
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:35,780
universities.
Is is a university of public institution

949
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,670
or is it an institution of higher 
learning?

950
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,713
No one would dispute that the manning 
center is free to invite disinvite or 

951
00:50:42,981 --> 00:50:43,814
not invite anyone that they want to come
to this conference to learn and to 

952
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,744
train.
But because universities are recipients 

953
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:51,014
of large amounts of tax dollars,
are they more of a public institution 

954
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:58,910
that is required to provide a bigger 
forum for speech free speech?

955
00:50:59,090 --> 00:50:59,923
And where do you draw that line?
When organizations that receive large 

956
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:04,003
amounts of charitable tax benefits are 
freer to disinvite or not invite or not 

957
00:51:09,201 --> 00:51:10,034
host,
you don't have to give a platform to 

958
00:51:11,451 --> 00:51:13,010
someone who speaks,
who disagree with,

959
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:14,143
but when do you,
when you're the recipient of public 

960
00:51:15,561 --> 00:51:16,800
monies.
Okay.

961
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:18,490
Well,
I think in the current context with,

962
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,353
with the universities and receiving $13 
billion a year from taxpayers in that 

963
00:51:23,111 --> 00:51:23,944
particular context,
I think that they don't have the right 

964
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:28,834
to behave as say,
a private institution like Trinity 

965
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,221
Western University,
uh,

966
00:51:33,221 --> 00:51:35,980
which gets no government funding.
That's very different.

967
00:51:35,981 --> 00:51:37,940
If Trinity Western University,
uh,

968
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,290
said we're going to ban the expression 
of,

969
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,153
of um,
atheism or Islam on campus and see 

970
00:51:44,921 --> 00:51:47,710
what's private institution as long as 
they're up front about that,

971
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:49,420
that when you go there,
you know that,

972
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,433
uh,
pro Islamic or pro atheist speech is 

973
00:51:52,091 --> 00:51:55,390
outlawed and you still choose to go to 
that university.

974
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:57,130
But ironically,
uh,

975
00:51:57,131 --> 00:51:59,050
what I've heard from people,
uh,

976
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,153
currently and in the past that are 
attending trinity is they do have 

977
00:52:01,721 --> 00:52:03,670
Muslims and atheists and gay people 
there.

978
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,510
And it is a healthy,
vigorous intellectual climate.

979
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,060
But in response to the question,
if,

980
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:13,240
if you're a private institution,
you can invite or not invite,

981
00:52:13,241 --> 00:52:15,220
you can do whatever you want.
Uh,

982
00:52:15,221 --> 00:52:16,054
but for the university is because 
they're holding themselves out as 

983
00:52:19,271 --> 00:52:23,590
supposedly in favor of academic inquiry 
and free expression.

984
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,480
They should be required to honor that 
commitment that they've made to,

985
00:52:26,481 --> 00:52:27,550
to taxpayers.
