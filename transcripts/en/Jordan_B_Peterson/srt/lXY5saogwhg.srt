1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:02,803
So the first question is,
how would you define self deception and 

2
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:08,640
how is that different from say,
cognitive dissonance?

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,301
Okay,
we'll,

4
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,970
we'll start with the first one.
How would you define self deception?

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,750
Well,
in most accounts of self deception,

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,093
most accounts of self deception have 
been basically formulated by logicians 

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:22,943
and the logicians make a presumption.
And the presumption is essentially that 

8
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:29,250
people think in,
um,

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,230
in fully articulated statements,
propositions you might say.

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,093
And as soon as you accept that you've 
run into the paradoxes of self 

11
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:39,690
deception.
So for example,

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:40,943
it doesn't necessarily seem possible to 
believe proposition a and proposition b 

13
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,044
at the same time.
So those would be stateable pro 

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,640
propositions if they conflict with one 
another.

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,590
But that begs a number of questions.
And one is first,

16
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:56,424
whether or not people think in 
propositions in fully articulated 

17
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:02,520
propositions,
which they do,

18
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:03,960
but it's not the only way they think.

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,700
And then also what does it mean for two 
things to con conflict?

20
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,380
So I'm going to start with the second 
answering the second question first.

21
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,330
So often when I've read badly written 
essays,

22
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,463
often undergraduate essays,
one of the things that occurs very 

23
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:28,281
frequently is that the writer will make 
a statement on page one or paragraph one

24
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:29,634
and then two paragraphs later write a 
statement that directly contradicts the 

25
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,124
first statement.
And because their thinking is confused 

26
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,193
because they're young and because they 
don't know how to write and aren't 

27
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,853
particularly careful,
they don't notice that the two 

28
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:49,320
propositions actually are illogical 
conflict.

29
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,663
And one of the things that indicates is 
that people actually don't know this 

30
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:57,150
when things are in logical conflict 
because there's no marker for that.

31
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,860
The only time people notice that their,
uh,

32
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,563
their presuppositions about the world or
in conflict is when they try to act out 

33
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,553
two contradictory notions at the same 
time and find out that acting one out 

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,670
interferes with acting another route.

35
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,870
And sometimes that happens because 
they're in conflict with themselves.

36
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:22,260
But even more often it happens because 
they become,

37
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,360
they enter into conflict with someone 
else.

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,913
So you might say that you don't even 
notice you're propositional conflicts 

39
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:30,180
until you act them out in the world 
stops you.

40
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,703
Okay.
So,

41
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,500
um,
so you can,

42
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,363
you can,
you can maintain contradictory 

43
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:39,294
cognitions endlessly without ever 
noticing how disorganized you are 

44
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:47,580
because the world doesn't slap you in 
the face for your foolishness unless you

45
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:48,414
try to act those things out.
So the idea that self deception is 

46
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:53,814
impossible because people can't hold two
contradictory propositions 

47
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,790
simultaneously.
That's completely ridiculous.

48
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,780
People do that all the time.
Um,

49
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,013
so then that's the answer to the second 
question and the answer to the first 

50
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:11,050
question is,
um,

51
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,980
the way that people generally deceive 
themselves is that they act out a series

52
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:18,814
of propositions.
So say a series of beliefs about the 

53
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:22,090
world or even one belief about the 
world.

54
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,373
And then they run into evidence that 
that inactive belief is not having the 

55
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:29,884
results desired.
So let's say you tell a joke at a party 

56
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,143
and no one laughs.
And your proposition was that the joke 

57
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:43,300
was funny and obviously the world 
indicated to you that

58
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,980
something about that proposition was 
faulty.

59
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,263
Now the problem is in part that the 
world doesn't tell you which part of 

60
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:54,464
that proposition is wrong.
It just tells you that the frame of 

61
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:58,874
reference that you were using when you 
were telling the joke had something 

62
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:03,914
wrong,
had something about it that was 

63
00:04:05,361 --> 00:04:08,600
sufficiently erroneous so that you 
didn't get the result that was intended.

64
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,690
But that's subject to all sorts of 
potential interpretations.

65
00:04:11,691 --> 00:04:12,524
And so that's,
that's a situation where a classic 

66
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:16,820
situation where the,

67
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,620
yeah,

68
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,453
the data,
which is the outcome of your joke is 

69
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,290
insufficiently.

70
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,163
Yeah.

71
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,950
Informative to precisely indicate to you
where that your mistake was made.

72
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:38,350
So it's subject to all sorts of 
potential interpretations.

73
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:39,184
And one interpretation could be all of 
these people at this party are too 

74
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:43,054
stupid to understand my humor.
And that's a perfectly reasonable 

75
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:48,220
proposition.
Although it's unlikely to be true.

76
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,893
Now,
generally what people do when they 

77
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:55,981
deceived themselves is that they,
they lay forth a belief in the world and

78
00:04:57,701 --> 00:04:58,534
the results aren't what they intended.
And that produces a negative emotional 

79
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:02,464
state.
And the negative emotional state 

80
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,074
indicates an error.
But then there's a whole process of 

81
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:07,744
exploration that has to occur to 
precisely specify the error and to 

82
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,703
precisely specify how the information 
about the error could be used to revamp 

83
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:17,224
the whole propositional sequence.
And that takes a tremendous amount of 

84
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:21,364
work,
like ridiculous amount of work because 

85
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,390
let's say people don't laugh at your 
jokes.

86
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,493
While why is that?
Well maybe you're hanging around with 

87
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:29,164
the wrong sort of people,
or maybe your jokes just aren't that 

88
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,124
funny,
or maybe you're kind of a jerk or maybe 

89
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:37,060
you don't know anything about social 
interaction.

90
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:41,020
And all of those possibilities emerge 
when your joke falls flat.

91
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:46,021
And in order for you to fully 
investigate the consequences of that,

92
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,000
you have to do a tremendous amount of 
cognitive work.

93
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,450
And so generally what happens is that 
people just don't do the work.

94
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,920
And then what they do is they,
they,

95
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,170
they have as a representation of their 
failure.

96
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,333
What you might describe as what you 
might describe as an it counter with 

97
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:09,110
chaos and the encounter is negative 
emotion,

98
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,663
emergency preparation,
and then complete indeterminacy as to 

99
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:16,730
the proposition of nature of the 
information.

100
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,960
Now,
if you do that enough times,

101
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,033
so you lay out your beliefs and they 
fail and you get a negative emotional 

102
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:26,444
response personally,
but you fail to engage in the difficult 

103
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,280
process of exploration to specify 
exactly what went wrong.

104
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,113
What will happen is that you'll collect 
around yourself and absolute morass of 

105
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:39,494
chaotic and indeterminant experienced.
And that's the place that you will end 

106
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:44,774
up living.
And that's what self deception really 

107
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:48,770
looks like.
It doesn't look like you believe a and b

108
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:50,950
at the same time and you know,
you,

109
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,110
you don't notice.
It's way more complicated than that.

110
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,770
And I would say that's akin to cognitive
dissonance,

111
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:58,604
but the explanation that I just provided
as far more thorough then the typical 

112
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:05,620
explanation of cognitive dissonance.
So,

113
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,933
so that's an answer to Mike's Question.
How would you define self deception and 

114
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:11,420
how was that different from cognitive 
dissonance?

115
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,270
So one of the things you guys might want
to do is take more than one question,

116
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,710
don't wait,
type of few.

117
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:26,590
And then I can select from,
there's people in the room with me here.

118
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,783
So,
which wouldn't be the case under normal 

119
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:31,570
circumstances,
but we're just testing this.

120
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,080
So any other questions?
Do you think some people seek out drama?

121
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,023
Eg,
they make things difficult for 

122
00:07:42,811 --> 00:07:44,700
themselves because they confuse it with 
meaning?

123
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,310
Yes.
People do that all the time.

124
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:48,563
Um,
is it because they confuse it with 

125
00:07:49,831 --> 00:07:51,840
meaning?
Yes.

126
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,460
Partly.
Um,

127
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,243
that's,
that's a really complicated question 

128
00:07:57,241 --> 00:07:58,074
that you're asking

129
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,340
the problem with.
Okay.

130
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:03,174
So,
so imagine that you gave people at 

131
00:08:04,561 --> 00:08:09,561
shorts and the choice could be that they
could suffer stupidly or they could live

132
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:12,510
a meaningful life.
And so you might say,

133
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:13,344
well,
obviously they're going to pick to live 

134
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,503
living a meaningful life,
but it's not so obvious because one of 

135
00:08:18,451 --> 00:08:19,284
the prices that you pay for living a 
meaningful life is that you have to 

136
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:24,444
adopt responsibility.
And the responsibility that's attendant 

137
00:08:28,111 --> 00:08:32,400
on living a meaningful life might is,
is theoretically without limit.

138
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,870
So,
for example,

139
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,183
what w the ways that's been 
conceptualized in classic Christianity 

140
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:40,380
is that in order to lead a meaningful 
life,

141
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:43,200
you have to take the world's sins onto 
yourself.

142
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,663
And that means that you have to see 
inside yourself all of the negative 

143
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:50,410
potentiality.
So they're characterized that,

144
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,610
that that being human is characterized 
by,

145
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,150
and then you have to take for addressing
those.

146
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,550
And so when Carl Jung talked about this,
for example,

147
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,713
you know,
one of the points he made was that if 

148
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:04,650
you do a thorough announced 
investigation into your own faults,

149
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:07,170
then you end up scouring,
what's the word?

150
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,810
It's not scouring precisely harrowing 
hell,

151
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,990
literally as close to literally as you 
might imagine.

152
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:14,400
And of course that's a very,
very,

153
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:17,520
very unpleasant experience.
And so then you might say,

154
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:18,354
well,
people are going to perfectly well and 

155
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,440
logically want to avoid that.
And then they do that using all sorts of

156
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:26,274
subterfuge because they don't want to 
admit to themselves that they're not 

157
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:29,634
taking any responsibility.
So they'll often generates false crises 

158
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:33,324
in their own life and amplified problems
beyond necessity so that they can 

159
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,034
convince themselves that when they're 
effortfully struggling through all that 

160
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:41,904
mess,
that they're actually taking 

161
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:44,340
responsibility for their lives,
but they're not.

162
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,103
And so that's one of the reasons that 
people might seek out drama and make 

163
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:50,664
things difficult for themselves.
And it's partly because they confuse it 

164
00:09:55,151 --> 00:09:57,770
with meaning,
but you know there's multiple levels of,

165
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,960
of horrible self deception and confusion
and avoidance that go along with that.

166
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,960
What role do you think diagnosis should 
play in clinical practice?

167
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,940
Oh,
that's easy.

168
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:17,020
You needed to to get reimbursed by 
insurance providers and that's about it.

169
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,590
I shouldn't say that because that's just
beating fast style.

170
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,930
There's a bunch of,
there's a variety of functions,

171
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:26,764
diagnosis place.
Part of part of engaging in the process 

172
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:32,434
of diagnosis is utilizing classification
and you need to utilize stable 

173
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,930
classifications for a number of reasons.
One of them is that

174
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,773
you can't understand anything about what
you're dealing with without classifying 

175
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:50,800
it.
And even if you classify it incorrectly,

176
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:53,050
that might be better than not 
classifying it all.

177
00:10:53,051 --> 00:10:55,990
Because once it's classified 
incorrectly,

178
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,853
you might at least be able to notice 
specifically what's incorrect about the 

179
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:01,744
classification and then rectify it,
which is to say that a bad theory might 

180
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:05,434
be better than no theory at all.
But diagnosis also helps you identify 

181
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:11,380
potential pathways forward.

182
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,050
So for example,
if you diagnose someone as agoraphobic,

183
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,320
then you have access to the large wealth
of treatment protocols that have already

184
00:11:20,891 --> 00:11:23,350
been developed for ag or phobia.
And that's for useful.

185
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,663
It helps you rule out other things and 
that that can be extremely important 

186
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:28,564
because sometimes someone will come to 
see you in a clinical practice and 

187
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,460
they're just overwhelmed by what's 
happening to them.

188
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,220
And what that means is that they're in 
chaos,

189
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,260
they're suffering,
and they have no idea why.

190
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,000
And then you could say,
well yeah,

191
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,163
what's happening to you is horrible,
but it's precisely this kind of 

192
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:44,284
horrible,
and here's what this kind of horrible 

193
00:11:47,531 --> 00:11:49,270
it's like,
and here's what you can do about it.

194
00:11:49,271 --> 00:11:50,104
And here is a bunch of other people who 
are also suffering from it and they've 

195
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:56,620
recovered.
So with this kind of horrible,

196
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:58,810
there's all these other things that you 
won't have to worry about.

197
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,680
And that's really,
um,

198
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:06,930
that can be really helpful for people 
because it narrows the universe of their

199
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:10,380
problems from all potential problems to,
um,

200
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,210
potentially manageable set of finite 
promos.

201
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,460
So,
so the,

202
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:16,294
so those are some of the,
some of the reasons for diagnosis and 

203
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:22,930
some of the reasons why diagnosis is 
useful.

204
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,363
So
how do you differentiate between having 

205
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,810
an actually bad life and having 
depression make your life bad?

206
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:32,920
Well,
that's a good,

207
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,753
that's a good question as well.
I think you could do that in a 

208
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:38,860
multidimensional way,
technically speaking.

209
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,641
So,
and so,

210
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:40,474
one of the ways I conceptualize that is 
that you imagine people's human life 

211
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:50,251
actually has a fairly stable and 
identifiable number of characteristics.

212
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,080
And so some of those are,
um,

213
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,060
you need to engage in trade with other 
people in that,

214
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,650
in modern culture that would generally 
be formalized as having a career.

215
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,323
You need to have friends,
you need to have an intimate 

216
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:09,640
relationship.
You need to be embedded within a family.

217
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,600
You have to conjure up something of high
quality.

218
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,140
That's productive to do with your life 
outside of work.

219
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,213
You have to attend to your physical and 
mental health and you have to regulate 

220
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:25,120
your use of mind altering substances 
like drugs and alcohol.

221
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,353
There's other dimensions,
but those are pretty decent as an 

222
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:30,380
initial.
Uh,

223
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,270
those serve the purpose quite nicely as 
an additional Schema.

224
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:39,310
So when you're talking to someone in,
say in a clinical intake,

225
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,413
the first thing you want to find out is,
is the person functional on any or all 

226
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:47,134
of those dimensions?
And the fewer dimensions on which 

227
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:50,614
they're actually functional,
the more they just have a bad life and 

228
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:58,050
aren't depressed.
So if you have no friends and you,

229
00:13:58,990 --> 00:13:59,823
you have no educational history and you 
certainly don't have an educational 

230
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:04,564
history,
say that's commensurate with your 

231
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:09,850
ability or maybe you have no abilities,
you have a patchy work history,

232
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,490
your family is an absolute nightmare.

233
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,953
You,
you,

234
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,110
all you do with your time is consumed 
drugs and alcohol,

235
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,393
um,
and you have one or more serious 

236
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:22,350
physical or mental health problems you 
have,

237
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,990
your life is,
has fallen apart and now you're going to

238
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:26,824
be suffering because of that.
But to call that depression is not 

239
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,860
useful,
particularly depression.

240
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,753
Technically speaking,
could spiral you into a place where 

241
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:39,310
those things are more likely.
But I would generally,

242
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,743
I think it's better to conceptualize 
depression as the mismatch between 

243
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:47,350
function and emotion.
So if I did that,

244
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,410
approximately six dimensional analysis 
with someone and I concluded that,

245
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:52,071
hey,
well look,

246
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:54,200
this person has friends,
um,

247
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,960
they may not be seeing them right now 
because they were in a bad state,

248
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,150
but they have friends and the friends 
are good for them.

249
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,610
They have an intimate relationship 
that's functional.

250
00:15:01,611 --> 00:15:02,444
They have,
they're embedded within a family that 

251
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:08,531
isn't to pathological.
They have a job that in principle serves

252
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:12,020
the function of a job,
but maybe that they could even be or had

253
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:13,730
been interested in,
et cetera.

254
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,950
Um,
it's back.

255
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:16,784
They're feeling terrible and they're 
having a difficult time getting out of 

256
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:19,730
bed.
I would say,

257
00:15:19,731 --> 00:15:22,580
well,
that increases the probability that they

258
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:25,340
should be accurately conceptualized as 
depressed.

259
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,220
And then of course in,
in a real situation,

260
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,330
the clinical presentation is generally 
some mixture of those sorts of things,

261
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,850
but it's very useful to distinguish one 
from another.

262
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,700
Have I read Ayn rand and if I have,
what are my thoughts on her philosophy?

263
00:15:42,251 --> 00:15:44,230
Objectivism of objectivism.

264
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,333
MMM,

265
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,940
Ayn rand is an idea log and she's an 
interesting in the alarm because she's,

266
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,343
she,
her ediology runs contrary to the most 

267
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,123
prevalent modern ideology,
which is the one that underlies 

268
00:15:58,901 --> 00:16:02,740
political correctness.
And so it's fun to read Ayn rand,

269
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:03,574
especially if you're hyper irritated by 
political correctness because she 

270
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,050
provides almost the perfect antidote to 
that.

271
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,030
But,
and you know,

272
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:13,864
I have some sympathy for her because she
wrote in a anticommunist vein and she 

273
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:18,844
had her reasons because your family was 
chased out of what became the Soviet 

274
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,520
Union by the Communists.
And if I remember correctly,

275
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:28,000
you had their property stolen and all 
the terrible things that went along with

276
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:28,980
that.
But

277
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,460
she writes hero stories of a certain 
type.

278
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,870
And the hero story is the individual 
against the collective,

279
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,730
roughly speaking.
And

280
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,770
that's a perfectly reasonable hero's 
story and it's a useful one.

281
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:47,963
But to think of that as the only valid 
hero story in the constellation of 

282
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,094
possible hero stories is a mistake 
because you can also write a perfectly 

283
00:16:57,331 --> 00:16:58,164
good story where the collective is 
relatively beneficial and it's the 

284
00:17:02,101 --> 00:17:06,000
collective and the hero against say,
the dire forces of nature.

285
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,550
And that's also a perfectly appropriate 
story.

286
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:09,803
So you might say that there are 
circumstances under which the attitude 

287
00:17:13,561 --> 00:17:17,370
that Ayn rand puts forth is accurate and
salutary.

288
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,204
But to think of that as covering the 
entire universe of potential proper 

289
00:17:22,861 --> 00:17:23,694
narratives is a big mistake.
And usually Ayn rand's acolytes do 

290
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:29,040
precisely that.
So,

291
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,510
okay.

292
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,343
Ariel says,
do you think all presupposition stem 

293
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:37,570
from religion?
No.

294
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,673
What I think is that the deepest 
presuppositions are identical to 

295
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:43,930
religion.
That actually when we,

296
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,810
when we talk about what constitutes 
religion,

297
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,673
what we are saying at the same is that 
we're dealing with the most fundamental 

298
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:52,614
presuppositions that people make.
And the thing that I find interesting 

299
00:17:56,731 --> 00:17:59,130
about that is that presuppositions are 
necessary.

300
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:03,330
And the reason for that is that because 
you have,

301
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:04,943
you're a finite cognitive agent,
you have extraordinarily limited 

302
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:12,120
understanding in order to deal with the 
world at all,

303
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:17,390
you have to act as if certain parts of 
it are both understood and stable,

304
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,013
like unchanging.
And those elements that you treat as 

305
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:26,940
stable and unchanging are at the deepest
level.

306
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:27,774
Are you religious presuppositions,
whether you think of them as religious 

307
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:31,464
or not is irrelevant if you don't think 
of them as religious or nor that their 

308
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:36,630
religious.

309
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,463
All that means is that you don't know 
anything about your presuppositions and 

310
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:41,280
that you don't know anything about 
religion.

311
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,080
And I learned that partly from reading 
Carl Young because one of the things you

312
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:51,230
posited was that the highest value that 
exists in a person's hierarchy of values

313
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,410
is de facto equivalent to their god.
Now,

314
00:18:58,411 --> 00:18:59,244
you know,
that isn't often how people 

315
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:02,940
conceptualize the idea of God or the 
idea of value,

316
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:03,774
but it doesn't really matter.
His point was that psychologically a 

317
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:06,834
person's higher highest value serve 
precisely the same function that a day 

318
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:16,470
at east serves in,
in a more explicitly religious society.

319
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:17,963
So in my experience too is being that,
that if you're ever having a 

320
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:27,801
conversation with someone that is really
digging towards the bottom of things,

321
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:29,843
you,
the language that has to be used as 

322
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:31,974
immediately religious,
because religious language is the only 

323
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:34,764
language that's kate capable of 
encapsulating the phenomena that exists 

324
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:42,630
at the deepest levels of analysis.
And so if that language has never become

325
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:45,360
necessary for you,
all that means is that you've never been

326
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:46,194
into sort of crisis that would 
necessitate it to you or that you don't 

327
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:51,030
have the language at hand,
which is not good.

328
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:59,340
Ioannis says some researchers see shame 
as something that is very destructive.

329
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,660
The consensus seems to be that it is an 
emotion that is always destructive.

330
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,100
Do you agree with this?
No,

331
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:05,934
that's absolutely ridiculous.
And only modern psychologists and 

332
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,833
probably social psychologists would be 
foolish enough to even dare deposits 

333
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,243
said something.
So absolutely observed psychopathy and 

334
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:22,581
shamelessness are the same thing.
So shame is shame.

335
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,813
No emotion is always destructive.
Any emotion taken to an extreme can be 

336
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:32,340
disruptive.
Just like any value taken to an extreme,

337
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,980
you know,
made into one thing can be destructive.

338
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,680
So,
um,

339
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,270
joy can be destructive.
I mean,

340
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,104
people who are manic are in some sense 
possessed by a radical excess of 

341
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:47,310
positive emotion and they,
they get incredibly impulsive.

342
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,840
And so,
and it's terribly destructive.

343
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:50,674
I mean,
there's almost no form of insanity 

344
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:52,954
that's more destructive than mania.
People will go out and spend all their 

345
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:59,440
money,
all their family's money and well,

346
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:04,441
it engage in all sorts of hyper 
optimistic interactions with the world.

347
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,810
It would result in their complete rude.
So you know,

348
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:10,540
people think of happiness as an 
untrammeled positive.

349
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:11,643
Well,
if you think of happiness as positive 

350
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:13,474
emotion,
which is partly true because it's also 

351
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:18,214
the absence of negative emotion,
if you think of happiness is only a 

352
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:21,904
good,
then you'll have no idea about the 

353
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:26,530
pathologies of positive emotion and 
their manifold and shame.

354
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,393
It's like if you do something stupid and
destructive to yourself or to yourself 

355
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:36,100
and the broader social community,
you should feel shame and you should pay

356
00:21:36,101 --> 00:21:37,840
attention to it and you should learn 
from it.

357
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:38,674
And if you're not capable of doing that,
that then people should stay the hell 

358
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:43,024
away from you because you're shameless.
And of course for most of western 

359
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:48,394
history,
and I don't know enough about other 

360
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:52,490
forms of history to also make the same 
comment to call someone.

361
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:53,820
Shameless was,
it was,

362
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:54,663
it was a tremendous insult.
It meant that they didn't have enough 

363
00:21:57,431 --> 00:22:00,070
sense to be appalled by the room 
pathology.

364
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,530
And there's,
that's,

365
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,890
that's just not a good thing at all.
What makes a successful researcher?

366
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,340
Um,
curiosity,

367
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,440
curiosity,
intelligence,

368
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,520
diligence,
you know,

369
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,300
those might be the personality 
attributes.

370
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,130
And then,
you know,

371
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,420
being embedded in,
uh,

372
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,063
in the kind of social network that 
supports research endeavors is also 

373
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,633
extraordinarily necessary.
So I guess you would add to that the 

374
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,740
capability for,
um,

375
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,860
extended collaborations.
Um,

376
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,300
the ability to write is also 
tremendously important.

377
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:45,134
I mean,
the place that I see most graduate 

378
00:22:46,971 --> 00:22:49,540
students fail,
it's,

379
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,403
it's,
it's very rare that a graduate student 

380
00:22:52,611 --> 00:22:53,444
is incapable of formulating a research 
hypothesis and they can always discuss 

381
00:22:56,361 --> 00:22:57,194
with other people what those hypotheses 
might be and also infer that next 

382
00:23:00,861 --> 00:23:05,780
logical step merely by being conversant 
with the relevant literature.

383
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:10,070
They can also run experiments.
They can generally also analyze them,

384
00:23:10,071 --> 00:23:12,380
although that starts to become a 
differentiator.

385
00:23:12,381 --> 00:23:14,720
But what kills graduate students is that
they,

386
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,630
they can't write.
And writing is really difficult.

387
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,080
So you have to be able to write and you 
have to either enjoy it,

388
00:23:23,181 --> 00:23:24,014
which means there's something wrong with
you or you have to be compelled to do 

389
00:23:26,301 --> 00:23:27,820
it.
And if,

390
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,030
if,
if you can't,

391
00:23:29,031 --> 00:23:33,230
then you're going to run into trouble.
Oh,

392
00:23:33,231 --> 00:23:35,810
let's see.
Christopher,

393
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,063
how do you feel psychotherapy and 
psychiatry should work together and 

394
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:42,170
curing psychological disorders?
Hmm.

395
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:45,200
Well,
I presume that by psychiatry,

396
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,483
what you're zeroing in on there probably
is the use of psychiatric drugs because 

397
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:55,700
otherwise there's not much distinction 
between psychiatry and psychotherapy.

398
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,950
Um,
look,

399
00:23:57,951 --> 00:23:58,784
if you have a serious problem,
you should be very wary of letting your 

400
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:09,770
a priority convictions interfere with 
your health.

401
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,090
So,
you know,

402
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,470
you hear very frequently that people are
all too easily

403
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:23,330
made all too easily seek help in the 
form of pills.

404
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:24,863
And I just think that's wrong.
I don't see any evidence for that at 

405
00:24:29,521 --> 00:24:31,530
all.
In my experience,

406
00:24:31,531 --> 00:24:36,531
no one comes to
a clinician saying,

407
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,700
please give me a pill for my mental 
illness.

408
00:24:41,701 --> 00:24:43,170
So it will go away.
First of all,

409
00:24:43,171 --> 00:24:44,004
people don't want to think even for a 
moment that they actually have a mental 

410
00:24:46,411 --> 00:24:47,670
illness.
Second,

411
00:24:47,671 --> 00:24:50,250
they certainly don't want to be modified
by a pill.

412
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,653
And you know,
they generally feel that that's an 

413
00:24:53,071 --> 00:24:56,640
abdication of responsibility and that 
they're terrified of the side effects.

414
00:24:56,641 --> 00:24:57,474
And that even if they do try it,
they want to get off it as fast as 

415
00:25:00,151 --> 00:25:01,800
possible.
And that it's a,

416
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,173
it's shameful that they have to be rely 
on some sort of medication to begin 

417
00:25:08,011 --> 00:25:09,930
with.
And so like a lot of what you're doing,

418
00:25:09,931 --> 00:25:10,764
if you're dealing with someone who's 
truly depressed is helping them come to 

419
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:15,114
terms with the fact that a trial of an 
antidepressant might be a useful thing 

420
00:25:19,261 --> 00:25:21,390
for them.
And that can take months,

421
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,253
that can take years.
So mean you don't want to leave any 

422
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:32,661
stone unturned in your search for health
and psych,

423
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:35,730
psych,
Psych,

424
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,713
psychiatric medications can be very 
useful and sometimes they're absolutely 

425
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:41,970
necessary.
So,

426
00:25:41,971 --> 00:25:45,230
for example,
your,

427
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,033
if you have someone who is flirting with
psychosis or who is already entered a 

428
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,150
psychotic state.

429
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,100
I think the general consensus in the 
literature,

430
00:25:56,101 --> 00:25:56,934
and I think it's appropriate,
is that if you don't facilitate their 

431
00:26:00,451 --> 00:26:01,284
use of anti psychotic medication,
what you're doing borders on 

432
00:26:04,201 --> 00:26:07,410
malpractice.
So now cake.

433
00:26:07,411 --> 00:26:08,244
So having said all that,
the probability that a medication alone 

434
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:16,500
will be sufficient to address the 
problem is low,

435
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,423
partly because medications for 
psychiatric disorders are much better 

436
00:26:22,951 --> 00:26:27,951
conceptualized as complex tools.
Then as curator of agents,

437
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,830
you have to learn to use them,
you'll have to learn what did,

438
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,090
you have to figure out what the drug 
should be.

439
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,850
You have to figure out what the dose 
should be.

440
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,390
You have to figure out what time of day 
you're going to take it.

441
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,733
Um,
and all of those are very complicated 

442
00:26:42,211 --> 00:26:45,990
decisions and a fair bit of experience 
to optimize.

443
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,683
And then you also have to learn how you 
use those medications while you're 

444
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:53,814
simile tineas Lee modifying whatever 
needs to be modified in your attitudes 

445
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:59,130
or your life in order to progress 
forward property.

446
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:04,130
So the optimal balance between the two 
is don't say no to drugs to,

447
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:09,683
to rapidly because you know,
you just might have the sort of problem 

448
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,183
that's best addressed with a psychiatric
medication and that could save you and 

449
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:23,061
your family not only suffering but even 
death because you know,

450
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:29,421
the probability of suicide was serious.
Depression is quite high and you know,

451
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,833
trying to help someone who's committed 
suicide because they're depressed is 

452
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:34,884
extraordinarily difficult.
So one of the things you really want to 

453
00:27:36,661 --> 00:27:40,950
do is stave that off.
But the drugs,

454
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:41,784
the medications have to be used as tools
in a sophisticated way within a 

455
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:47,394
therapeutic alliance because otherwise 
the probability that their work is just 

456
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:50,604
extremely low,
they're just too complicated and they 

457
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:54,900
have too many negative side effects.
Like even with antidepressants,

458
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:55,734
even when they work,
they generally interfere with people's 

459
00:27:57,871 --> 00:27:59,910
sexual function.
So,

460
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,103
and that can be good if the person who's
depressed is also suffering from 

461
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:04,824
something like premature ejaculation 
because antidepressants are good for 

462
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,710
fixing that,
but they produce an orgasmic out,

463
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,593
which can be a real catastrophe that 
that's more likely with women and slow 

464
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:20,670
sexual response and in end inhibited 
sexual desire.

465
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,503
And you know,
all of that can be extraordinarily 

466
00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:24,054
problematic.
And that's just one of a host of side 

467
00:28:25,501 --> 00:28:26,334
effects that are,
that psychiatric medications are likely 

468
00:28:28,681 --> 00:28:30,810
to generate.
So there,

469
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,430
yeah,

470
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,120
they're,
they're like chainsaws,

471
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:34,700
you know,
there,

472
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,300
there are tools and they're useful but 
they're kind of rough and you know,

473
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:41,240
if you use them in property they can do 
more damage than good.

474
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,840
How do you,
how should you decide between being hard

475
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:53,860
on yourself and giving yourself a break?
That's a good,

476
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:57,310
that's a very good question.
So,

477
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,893
um,
one of the populations that I've had 

478
00:29:01,931 --> 00:29:02,764
some experience with as being,
I've worked with a lot of lawyers and 

479
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:10,270
these are usually very successful,
hard driving,

480
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:15,330
ambitious people who are that way for a 
variety of reasons often because they're

481
00:29:15,551 --> 00:29:17,890
hyper conscientious as well as being 
competitive.

482
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,023
But they're almost always at least hyper
conscientious and they have other 

483
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:24,520
personality attributes.
And you know,

484
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:27,760
one question that a person like that 
addresses is,

485
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,193
well,
how hard should I work and what am I 

486
00:29:30,671 --> 00:29:35,260
just being useless?
And the general answer to that isn't,

487
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,153
well,
you should seek some appropriate work 

488
00:29:37,831 --> 00:29:40,330
life balance because that's just a 
bloody cliche.

489
00:29:40,331 --> 00:29:45,220
If you're in high,
highly competitive job,

490
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:53,100
you're being chased by your peers and 
your clients and the marketplace to work

491
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:57,370
flat out as fast as you can all the 
time.

492
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,800
And so then the question that you have 
to face as well,

493
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:01,634
why?
Under what conditions should you not do 

494
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:04,054
that?
And I've found Piaget's thinking very 

495
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:07,084
useful in formulating an answer to that.
And the fundamental answer is you 

496
00:30:12,641 --> 00:30:13,474
shouldn't work so hard that you failed.
You shouldn't work so hard that you 

497
00:30:18,071 --> 00:30:23,071
can't continue to work that hard.
So if you're working 80 hours a week and

498
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:26,584
say you don't take a day off,
you will eventually hurt yourself in a 

499
00:30:31,721 --> 00:30:35,320
manner that will make it impossible for 
you to continue working 80 hours a week.

500
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,393
So that's obviously counterproductive.
So let's assume that your goal is in 

501
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:44,671
spit is to maximize your productivity.
And then you might say,

502
00:30:44,741 --> 00:30:45,574
well that means that you have to take 
care of yourself because otherwise 

503
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,750
you're going to burn out,
you're going to get depressed,

504
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:52,090
you're going to get anxious,
you're going to get exhausted,

505
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,403
which for which there is no diagnostic 
category and that's going to interfere 

506
00:30:55,841 --> 00:30:56,674
with your career.

507
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:01,570
So what you have to learn is how can you
maximize your productivity?

508
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,153
And often that means learning actually 
how much work you can do and how much 

509
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:08,734
leisure you need and how much you need 
to involve yourself in activities that 

510
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:13,114
are outside of work.
And one of the things that happens to 

511
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:16,954
women,
particularly when they hit their 

512
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:20,224
thirties and I'll speak primarily about 
the lawyers that I've worked with 

513
00:31:23,121 --> 00:31:26,230
because I've looked worked with lots of 
female lawyers who will be made partners

514
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:28,240
in large firms.
So they've been very successful,

515
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,583
is that they hit 30 or so,
they're through their apprentice ship 

516
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:39,420
and they start to get very disillusioned
with their job.

517
00:31:40,421 --> 00:31:41,254
And part of the reason for that is,
is that they make partner and then they 

518
00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:43,924
find out that the partners that they're 
associated with have all the foibles 

519
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:48,310
that are associated with normal people.

520
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,400
And so there's a bit of a decline in 
idealism,

521
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,593
but they also find out that there 
actually is a lot more to life than 

522
00:31:56,231 --> 00:31:59,110
working like a mad dog for 80 hours a 
week,

523
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,680
purely on legal issues,
which might not even be that interesting

524
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,570
in and of themselves.
So then they have to figure out,

525
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,760
well how much time should be taken off.
And most of the lawyers that I've worked

526
00:32:12,761 --> 00:32:13,594
with have ended up working,
working fewer hours but billing more 

527
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,263
hours.
So in fact they got to have their cake 

528
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:20,824
and eat it too.
They take a day off a week or two days 

529
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:23,734
off a week.
They generally can't work shorter hours 

530
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:28,540
cause that isn't how a profession like 
that works.

531
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:32,770
But they can plan to take time off in 
the future and do that quite regularly.

532
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:37,480
So maybe it's a two week vacation every 
three months or every four months,

533
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:38,710
something like that.
Or a week,

534
00:32:38,711 --> 00:32:39,544
every four months.
And what they almost inevitably find is 

535
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:44,990
that the boost they get from the 
vacation

536
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,663
increases their ability to concentrate 
at work and makes them more valuable as 

537
00:32:51,121 --> 00:32:51,954
a practicing partner.
And so you can think about it as the 

538
00:32:54,361 --> 00:32:58,950
attempt to reach an equilibrium state.
The question,

539
00:32:58,951 --> 00:33:02,700
how much should you work is really the 
question,

540
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:04,763
how much can you work productively so 
that you can have the longest possible 

541
00:33:08,431 --> 00:33:09,264
productive

542
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,943
and sustainable career?
And that means that you have to set up 

543
00:33:14,501 --> 00:33:15,334
your career in such a way that it 
doesn't eat so much of your life that 

544
00:33:18,101 --> 00:33:18,934
you come to resent and hate it because 
otherwise you'll bail out or you'll act 

545
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,120
in a counterproductive matter all you're
hurting yourself or so forth.

546
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,343
So I would say for young people,
the way that you figured that out is 

547
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:31,054
that you pick something difficult to do 
when you work yourself half to death 

548
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:38,440
doing it so that you can figure out 
where your actual limits are,

549
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:42,010
like your limits of psychological and 
physiological endurance.

550
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,053
And once you've exceeded your limits to 
pull back to the point where that 

551
00:33:46,631 --> 00:33:47,464
becomes sustainable.
And then that way you're being hard on 

552
00:33:50,381 --> 00:33:51,214
yourself to test yourself out,
but you're also allowing yourself the 

553
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,283
opportunity to pursue what you're 
pursuing in the best of possible health 

554
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:04,540
and with the highest probability of 
continuing in a high quality manner into

555
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:07,840
the future.
Um,

556
00:34:07,841 --> 00:34:09,490
what are my views on euthanasia?

557
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,413
Okay.

558
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,373
Is the fact that so many are against it 
a symptom of individuals and societal 

559
00:34:16,201 --> 00:34:17,034
aversion to death?
Or is it of the more practical issues 

560
00:34:19,801 --> 00:34:20,850
like consent,
morality?

561
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,410
Oh,
well I mean euthanasia.

562
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,240
So complete nightmare.
I mean,

563
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:25,703
you know the slippery slope from,
it's okay if someone who's terminally 

564
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:32,970
ill wants to die too.
Let's empty out the hospitals of all the

565
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:37,070
people in it who are no longer being 
socially productive is like that's a,

566
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:43,700
that's a road that society's traveled 
down one tiny little step at a time.

567
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:48,840
And so when you open up the specter of 
euthanasia,

568
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:53,430
you're also opening up endless cans of 
snakes,

569
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:58,790
the existence of which many of which you
have no idea even exist.

570
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,293
Now

571
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,970
I kind of think of euthanasia like 
torture.

572
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,810
So you can imagine this situation.
Imagine the following situation.

573
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:16,310
And it's unrealistic because no real 
situation is this clearly bounded,

574
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,840
but we'll use it for the sake of 
argument.

575
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,063
Imagine that you know for certain that 
someone in your custody as planted an 

576
00:35:25,611 --> 00:35:26,444
extremely high and explosive device and 
extremely high capacity in a football 

577
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:33,950
stadium and they are going to detonate 
it unless you find out where it is.

578
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,291
Well,
you might say,

579
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:37,124
well,
what interrogation techniques might be 

580
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:47,420
ethically available to you in order to 
conduct that investigation?

581
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:52,210
And I would say,
I know this is

582
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,590
a flawed philosophical argument,
but I'm just using it as,

583
00:35:57,591 --> 00:35:59,550
as a,
as a as an example,

584
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:06,600
high levels of threat isn't 
interrogation technique.

585
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:11,130
You should be willing to undergo 
prosecution for your actions.

586
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,130
You can't expect to get a free ride even
if,

587
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,383
because the use of torture say in a 
situation like that is so absurdly 

588
00:36:18,391 --> 00:36:19,224
socially dangerous that even if you 
could make a case that it was ethically 

589
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,470
justifiable in that particular 
circumstance,

590
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:26,843
you should pretty much be willing to 
give up the rest of your life as a 

591
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:30,780
consequence of having participated in 
that.

592
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,960
And I kind of think the same thing about
euthanasia.

593
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,853
It's like,

594
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:37,903
you know what it needs,
you said once the nobody who's truly 

595
00:36:40,461 --> 00:36:44,210
lived hasn't experienced the necessity 
of killing,

596
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,950
you know,
to put this in simple terms,

597
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:49,843
you know,
I have my dog put down in February 

598
00:36:51,591 --> 00:36:56,591
because he,
he was done and allowing him to expire.

599
00:36:57,271 --> 00:37:02,271
It naturally seem to
involve nothing but a lot of unnecessary

600
00:37:03,111 --> 00:37:08,080
suffering.
So you can certainly imagine a situation

601
00:37:08,081 --> 00:37:13,081
where euthanasia seems like an
the ethical option,

602
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:15,534
but that doesn't mean that it shouldn't 
be absolutely surrounded by high 

603
00:37:18,691 --> 00:37:20,010
thickets of illegality.

604
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,320
Okay.

605
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,840
I mean,
sometimes I think to do the right thing,

606
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:27,270
you're required to break the law and be 
punished for it.

607
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:33,860
Now
part from that,

608
00:37:34,611 --> 00:37:37,790
I've also learned that commenting 
generally on questions like that is,

609
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:42,050
this is almost always a mistake because 
the devil's always in the details.

610
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,800
So,
all right.

611
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,373
Is there a way to find your true passion
or is that just a cliche was definitely 

612
00:37:51,921 --> 00:37:53,880
a cliche and it,
and it,

613
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,913
you know,
it's the sort of thing that actually 

614
00:37:56,751 --> 00:38:01,010
annoys me quite a lot about new age 
thinkers.

615
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,890
I would more or less put Joseph Campbell
in that category.

616
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,363
Um,
I think you can find what compels you 

617
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,623
and what might enable you to live in a 
high quality manner despite the 

618
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:20,280
suffering that's associated with life.
I think you can discover that.

619
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:21,114
And I think part of the way you discover
that is by watching yourself and 

620
00:38:25,381 --> 00:38:28,200
learning when it is that you are 
meaningfully engaged.

621
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,503
You have to notice that it's something 
that happens to you in some rather than 

622
00:38:35,741 --> 00:38:36,574
something that you do.
You have to notice when you're 

623
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:39,934
meaningfully engaged and then you have 
to work to expand the amount of time 

624
00:38:44,471 --> 00:38:45,304
that you spend in that state.
But I would also say that there are 

625
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:51,730
moral requirements that go along with 
that too because you might say,

626
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:54,070
well what if you happen to be the sort 
of person,

627
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:58,660
for example who finds torturing small 
animals meaningfully engaging?

628
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:02,260
Um,
it seems like that's a,

629
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,760
that's the sort of meaningful engagement
that you probably don't want to expand.

630
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:07,983
So I would say that if you're going to 
set up your life so that you maximize 

631
00:39:10,961 --> 00:39:12,760
your meaningful engagement,
you have to,

632
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,100
there's a number of other things that 
you have to do.

633
00:39:15,101 --> 00:39:18,250
At the same time.
And one of those is that you have to get

634
00:39:18,251 --> 00:39:22,300
very clear about
who you are and what you're doing.

635
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,590
And so although this would be grounds 
for a much longer discussion,

636
00:39:26,591 --> 00:39:30,970
I think that one of the things that you 
have to do if you're going to attempt to

637
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,013
maximize,
make meaningful engagement is that you 

638
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:38,791
also have to do such things as
uh,

639
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,293
endeavor to stop deceiving yourself and 
other people in every way you possibly 

640
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:44,974
can.
And part of the reason for that is that 

641
00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:52,741
if you engage in deception of any sort,
you pathologize the structure,

642
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:57,663
the structure of your being.
But you could say you pathologize the 

643
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:04,360
structure of your nervous system and 
then you can't trust it's reports.

644
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:05,883
So if you're nervous,
if you're going to rely on your nervous 

645
00:40:07,661 --> 00:40:08,494
system's reports of meaningful 
engagement to guide your future 

646
00:40:11,051 --> 00:40:13,930
activities,
you better do everything you can to make

647
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:14,764
sure that you're not filling that 
nervous system with the kind of garbage 

648
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:19,630
that's going to make it malfunction and 
give again,

649
00:40:19,631 --> 00:40:21,010
give you false reports.

650
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,173
So I think that moving towards 
meaningful engagement has to be 

651
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:30,070
associated with making truth,
your highest value because otherwise you

652
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:33,460
can't trust yourself as your own guide.
I mean,

653
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:34,294
the Catholics have struggled with this 
for a long time from a theological 

654
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:38,500
perspective because the Catholic 
position,

655
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,633
roughly speaking,
is that human beings are so steeped in 

656
00:40:41,531 --> 00:40:42,364
sin that they can't trust their own 
instincts in relationship to good and 

657
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:49,990
evil and have to use the church and the 
priesthood as an intermediary.

658
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:55,120
And you know,
you can obviously have an argument about

659
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:55,954
that.
And of course Protestants have 

660
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:57,754
historically done that,
but you've got to give the Catholics 

661
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:02,000
there do.
It's like people aren't pure,

662
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,360
are by nature and and only traveled in 
their vision by us.

663
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,223
It'll sociological impediments.
There are also corrupt beyond belief 

664
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:11,740
individually and half to use society as 
a source of value.

665
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:17,340
So if you're going to personalize your 
life in some sense,

666
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,060
you better act in a manner that makes 
you a reliable guide.

667
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:27,570
So
what time is two 30 well,

668
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,703
I think maybe we'll call that a day 
because I'm starting to get tired and 

669
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:37,210
I'll start giving answers that not only 
rambled,

670
00:41:37,211 --> 00:41:39,190
but never actually come back to the 
question.

671
00:41:39,191 --> 00:41:41,380
So let's call that a day and,
uh,

672
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,540
we'll take a look and see how it worked.
