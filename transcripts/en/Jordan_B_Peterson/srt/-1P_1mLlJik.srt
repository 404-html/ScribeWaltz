1
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,430
Right,
no,

2
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:51,790
it
was like,

3
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,380
ha
ha ha,

4
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,343
please reasonable opposition.
It's best to let the unreasonable 

5
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,144
opposition speak because they manifest 
themselves as unreasonable and then 

6
00:24:02,771 --> 00:24:03,604
everyone can see it.
So that's part of the reason that you 

7
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,830
want free speech because you want 
people.

8
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:14,450
Oh
well,

9
00:24:15,511 --> 00:24:16,800
at least the last,
the back

10
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,190
leg,
Dr Peterson.

11
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,080
No one's security can't help no matter 
what their job,

12
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,120
no matter what they do,
they're wrong.

13
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,050
They're wrong.
Cause trouble for any students,

14
00:24:40,051 --> 00:24:42,040
no matter who the students are,
what you're doing

15
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,373
there.
Just about horse take care of 

16
00:24:58,561 --> 00:25:01,160
themselves.
All right,

17
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:06,170
so I can tell you a little bit about why
I opposed to build seasick and there's a

18
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:11,300
variety of reasons.
I think the most,

19
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,633
isn't it?
It's the first piece of Canadian 

20
00:25:14,671 --> 00:25:15,504
legislation that's ever been put forward
but actually requires people to use the 

21
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:24,060
particular center works.
Now there is other legislation that does

22
00:25:24,061 --> 00:25:26,040
govern to some degree what you can't 
say.

23
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,003
So for example,
you can't incite and crime and that's 

24
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,700
perfectly logical,
reasonable restriction on free speech,

25
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,563
but we've never had a piece of 
legislation ever that would require you 

26
00:25:36,241 --> 00:25:37,074
to use a certain kind of vocabulary and 
regardless of what it is and the fact 

27
00:25:41,221 --> 00:25:44,910
that it happens to be about 
transgendered terminology hypothetically

28
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:47,190
is almost beside the point as far as I'm
concerned,

29
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,570
it's all focused on this,
on a focused,

30
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:54,390
on this particular issue to focus on 
some issue,

31
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:57,360
but this isn't the issue that's at the 
bottom of it.

32
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,523
It's just that complex things manifest 
themselves in very particular locations 

33
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:06,090
and this just happens to be the location
that this is manifesting itself here.

34
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,653
Now the other thing that I really didn't
like it still don't like about bill cc 

35
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,993
is the surrounding policies that are 
basically part of what it's embedded in 

36
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,300
that were produced by the Ontario Human 
Rights Commission,

37
00:26:18,301 --> 00:26:20,980
which I think is an appallingly 
dangerous organization,

38
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,000
not at least because they're terribly 
muddy thinkers.

39
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:29,460
One of the things,
one of the things that's happened,

40
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,560
but I think from a psychological 
perspective,

41
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,710
is there anyone terrio soon likely in 
Canada.

42
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,280
We're going to write into law an idea of
identity.

43
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,230
It's just radically insufficient.
So let me give you some examples.

44
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:49,770
So the way that bill see 16 is currently
coordinated.

45
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:52,590
If you take into account the surrounding
policy documents,

46
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,573
there's a.
there's a proposition embedded in the 

47
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:59,820
law and that is that biological sex,
gender identity,

48
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,833
gender expression and sexual preference 
vary independently and the fact of the 

49
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:11,700
matter is that's not true and you can 
demonstrate it very straightforwardly.

50
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:12,563
The first thing you observed is that 
virtually everyone whose biological sex 

51
00:27:16,141 --> 00:27:20,430
is either male or female,
has a gender identity of male or female.

52
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:21,583
In fact,
the the people who go into that 

53
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:26,820
category,
they exist.

54
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:29,290
There's no doubt about that,
but they're very small minority.

55
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:30,803
The reason I'm pointing out with the 
minority because makes the claim that 

56
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:36,024
those things very independently
and then you know to that most of the 

57
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:41,094
people who have a binary biological sex 
and the binary gender identity also 

58
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:48,234
present themselves in a manner that's 
the same as their gender identity in 

59
00:27:51,851 --> 00:27:52,684
their biological sex.
And so that's another indication of the 

60
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:58,470
non independence of the three layers of 
purported identity.

61
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,543
And finally,
you can see too that the vast majority 

62
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:03,000
of people,
for example,

63
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:03,983
men who are biologically male,
who present themselves as male or who 

64
00:28:07,531 --> 00:28:09,720
identify as male present themselves at 
male,

65
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,703
are also heterosexual.
Ninety five percent of the perhaps 98 

66
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:15,880
percent of them depends on the 
statistics,

67
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:25,920
but we don't want
those.

68
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:32,570
That event now,
I think he is on top

69
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,233
anyways.
The reason that I think that this is a 

70
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:42,714
problem is because it's written into the
law and the law isn't the place where 

71
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:47,340
you debate those sorts of things.

72
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,430
You don't instantiate a particular 
philosophy into the law,

73
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,340
especially one that's predicated on what
I would say it's.

74
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,930
It's absolutely incoherent and not only 
that,

75
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,793
like even if you're thinking about it 
from the perspective of someone say 

76
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,970
who's who's homosexual.
One of the arguments that people who are

77
00:29:05,971 --> 00:29:06,804
gay very frequently used,
if there's actually the biological 

78
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:13,410
underpinning to their homosexuality,
what we're going to dispense with that,

79
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,660
but what happens if we dispense with 
that?

80
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,323
What happens if we dispense with the 
idea that there's a biological 

81
00:29:19,321 --> 00:29:23,400
underpinnings of homosexuality that mean
that it can just be changed and what are

82
00:29:23,401 --> 00:29:26,910
people gonna do with that piece of 
information except trying to change it.

83
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,643
The people who are who've been fighting 
for homosexual rights for the last 30 

84
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:32,514
years very frequently made the case that
the reason that the rights were 

85
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:38,460
necessary was because there was a 
reality to the condition.

86
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,860
Well,
I'm not arguing for that or against it.

87
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:44,710
What saying is that the law,
the way it's currently constituted makes

88
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:45,544
arguments like that completely invalid.
It does the same thing with 

89
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:51,590
transsexuality and which are we don't 
know enough about to.

90
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,730
We don't know enough about it to 
determine,

91
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,350
say it's its manner of causal origins 
now it looks to me like,

92
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,403
like I think it's premature to exclude a
biological component and especially 

93
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:03,154
because of what we know about how gender
identity and biological sex are 

94
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:08,000
instantiated in utero.
So we know

95
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,820
it's an apple,
that

96
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:16,580
the standard human fetus has a female 
morphology.

97
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,753
It doesn't matter whether take six weeks
and then it's transformed into a male 

98
00:30:23,511 --> 00:30:28,010
morphology
with testosterone.

99
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,580
Right,
so

100
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,610
the reason I tell them,
you

101
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,870
save your breath,
we got all night.

102
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,660
The reason that I'm telling you this is 
because

103
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,673
there's no reason.
There's no reason whatsoever you can 

104
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,753
presume that the laws are being put in 
place to protect the people that these 

105
00:31:10,131 --> 00:31:14,280
laws are supposed to protect.
Anything that remotely

106
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,690
and as I mentioned when we were in the 
hall,

107
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:22,910
talk to you about the letters that I've 
received from sexual abuse,

108
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,663
terrifying about all of this.
The vast majority of them don't want to 

109
00:31:27,861 --> 00:31:30,860
be as invisible as everyone else wants 
to be.

110
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:42,650
Noisily
by people who want to speak for them.

111
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,193
So
one of the things we really have to get 

112
00:31:48,441 --> 00:31:53,441
over in a serious idea that just because
you're talking to someone black or white

113
00:31:54,141 --> 00:31:54,974
or color,
you're a member of a homogenous try and 

114
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,663
get the opinion that they happened to 
have the opinion that all those who are 

115
00:32:04,401 --> 00:32:05,234
like them,
there's nothing that's more racist than 

116
00:32:08,871 --> 00:32:09,704
that assumption
and I can predict everything that you 

117
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:19,364
are and everything that you think.
Lots of terrible thing to believe and 

118
00:32:22,761 --> 00:32:24,530
it's awesome.
Patently untrue.

119
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:25,803
You know,
there's no reason to assume that any 

120
00:32:27,501 --> 00:32:28,334
group of people who don't fit into 
traditional society for some rea or any 

121
00:32:32,841 --> 00:32:33,674
more homogenous in their general makeup 
and your political views than any other 

122
00:32:37,611 --> 00:32:38,700
group.
In fact,

123
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:42,760
all evidence suggests precisely
so.

124
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,610
Another thing I really don't like about 
it.

125
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,003
Talk
about why it's important to be able to 

126
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:14,601
have this discussion.
Well,

127
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,310
I can tell.
I can tell you

128
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,693
these
tends to shut people down or being made 

129
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,660
because you need to know this.
So

130
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:35,060
as far as I've been able to determine,
this kind of protest is an expression of

131
00:33:37,121 --> 00:33:40,150
a philosophy that's grounded partly in 
postmodernism.

132
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,473
Pardon me and Marxism.
The postmodern element is basically 

133
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:46,024
this.
There was no such genuine individual 

134
00:33:49,411 --> 00:33:50,244
identity is this identity and you liked 
it or not only have the interests of 

135
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:56,494
your group and the whole world is 
nothing but a battle ground between 

136
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:03,070
groups of different interests.
There's no dialogue,

137
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:08,350
there's no parking between the groups.
It's just a power stage.

138
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:09,603
Combat has to take place,
and so the reason that speakers with 

139
00:34:13,571 --> 00:34:14,404
whom the radical postmodernists and the 
Marxists don't agree or deny the 

140
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:23,110
platform was because most people do not 
believe from a philosophical position.

141
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:27,400
The dialogue can bring consensus and all
that's left.

142
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:32,401
If you forgo that particular principle,
this is only where it start.

143
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,250
You know the fact that you're all pretty
damn setting.

144
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:41,620
Thank God for that because if there were
enough fools in the crowd,

145
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:44,650
especially those who are intent on 
violence,

146
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:49,590
this would turn out very differently.
We do not want to go down that pathway.

147
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,540
It's a big mistake.
We've been down that pathway many,

148
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:54,374
many years.

149
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,623
I would certainly not conformed to a 
consensus that was against my belief 

150
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,770
merely because it was a consensus in the
group is wrong.

151
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,573
The question was,
if there was a consensus against my 

152
00:35:11,061 --> 00:35:11,894
beliefs,
what are you going with them and answer 

153
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,870
that would be well first it would depend
on what my conscience said.

154
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,740
What are we going to assume that the 
consensus is correct?

155
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:25,270
The Nazis had a consensus,
right?

156
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,413
The individual has a conscience and you 
have to know when the group is made a 

157
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,173
mistake.

158
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,370
Jordan talked a lot in your personality 
clause,

159
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:56,040
very confronting your shadow,
your shadow.

160
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,043
Do you find that people who care less 
about what other people think and care 

161
00:36:00,481 --> 00:36:01,314
more about their conscience have 
integrated their shadow maybe more than 

162
00:36:03,901 --> 00:36:06,600
people who care more about others?

163
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:14,560
Can you hear me at all?
So there was a question.

164
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:19,190
The question wise stemming from my 
personality class,

165
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,363
I think that people are willing to abide
by their are those who have integrated 

166
00:36:26,711 --> 00:36:27,544
their shadow and I would say yes because
you have to be a bit of a monster to 

167
00:36:32,051 --> 00:36:34,210
stand up to the crowd,
right?

168
00:36:34,211 --> 00:36:39,040
If you're too concerned with people to 
you and if you're to avoid conflict,

169
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:44,460
then you're going to cave to pressure 
and you don't want to do that because if

170
00:36:44,531 --> 00:36:47,740
you let people stop you from moving 
forward,

171
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,890
you just end up being something.
And if you have someone who stopped,

172
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,750
you've got no life in you and that's no 
good.

173
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,033
So you have to get tough,
but you have to give tough in a way 

174
00:36:59,561 --> 00:37:01,510
that's controlled,
right?

175
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:02,344
It has to be controlled because 
otherwise you're the puppet of your 

176
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:08,830
worst impulses and that's a terrible 
thing to be.

177
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,640
Pinocchio.
Other questions?

178
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,403
The question was,
we called the police and had them 

179
00:37:21,851 --> 00:37:23,650
removed.
Would've that been a failure?

180
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:30,450
I think the answer is no.
There's no reason to assume that this is

181
00:37:32,591 --> 00:37:36,790
a bad thing.
It's noisy and it's annoying,

182
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,423
but that's fine.
You got to let things go to follow what 

183
00:37:42,341 --> 00:37:46,360
you believe to be true.
Don't worry about it,

184
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,313
and then let things happen and see what 
happens because it's perfectly possible 

185
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,463
that if you're trying to do the right 
thing and you're trying to say that 

186
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,120
whatever happens around you
and then it's a good thing.

187
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,553
So we'll see.
We'll have weeks after this event to 

188
00:38:05,051 --> 00:38:10,051
analyze its consequences and so far all 
of those of you that are there to listen

189
00:38:10,931 --> 00:38:11,764
to me talk,
you're peaceful and reasonable and you 

190
00:38:13,841 --> 00:38:16,780
got a chance to show that to hundreds of
thousands of people.

191
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,290
This is a good thing.
Not a bad thing.

192
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,040
How do we get these people to understand
the dialogue needs to consensus

193
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,710
cannot make people who don't listen,
listen,

194
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,830
they have to decide to listen,
but you do that by listening,

195
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,550
engage in dialogue and softened contract
consensus among you.

196
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:50,590
You live by example because there's no 
getting through this.

197
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,650
It's an ideological war and the harder 
you push against it,

198
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:59,680
don't worry about it,
but don't.

199
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,910
Don't get pushed around and don't let 
people in

200
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,243
doctrinaire.
There's clearly a liberal left bias on 

201
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:27,010
campuses.
The documentation is very clear.

202
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,760
If you go online and watch Jonathan 
Heights' videos,

203
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,950
he explains it.
Partly.

204
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,910
The reason for that is that people are 
higher in openness.

205
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:43,810
A trait are more likely to go to 
university and into academia,

206
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,003
so there is some trait reasons,
but over the last 30 years he's become 

207
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:49,590
overwhelmingly left wing.

208
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,380
Take your club.
You know you're not under the control of

209
00:39:59,381 --> 00:40:02,960
the professors at university.
You're here to educate yourself.

210
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:08,500
Some professors will
help

211
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:23,420
yourself as you
want to know about

212
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:52,240
the peach.
Don't enroll in the

213
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:02,530
humanities paper
citations.

214
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:08,940
We also have no idea how widespread this
sort of thing is.

215
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:15,220
Maybe two or three percent,
very tiny minority,

216
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:17,410
but very well organized,
very noisy.

217
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:22,970
So the other thing you have to
organize yourself,

218
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,720
you
get your damn arguments together,

219
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,160
pushed back
against them.

220
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,390
You're pushing,
but that's you're

221
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:01,500
someone who's articulate
so that you learn how to

222
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:17,710
make
powerful and that's what universities

223
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,353
articulates.

224
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:38,080
So the question is,
I've made a good idea to let your

225
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,890
questionnaires,
what happened,

226
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,160
guide you.
I'm not going to happen

227
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:59,050
and you want to rely on.
You have to make sure that

228
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:05,000
I
apologize.

229
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,610
You're
speak to you properly.

230
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,170
Internal Guide,
post.

231
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:19,200
You have to be honest because otherwise
that's a terrible mistake.

232
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,230
So the reason that you don't lie
against

233
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,410
pathological,
if

234
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,830
you
can't trust yourself,

235
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,383
then you can have your political
or you can have nothing and neither of 

236
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:43,280
those things are reasonable.
Replacements

237
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:50,350
went
really well.

238
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,140
Are
you

239
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,540
a
chance to talk to has

240
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,690
cut into video?
A

241
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:51,120
big fan,
big fan

242
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,600
out there is a chance to talk to him.
