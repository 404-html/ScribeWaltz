1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,913
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:06,930
So today I'm talking to two of my 
compatriots I suppose,

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,233
um,
in this ongoing discussion in Canada 

4
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:14,070
about,
um,

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,000
free speech issues,
including compelled speech.

6
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:17,834
And I met Jared Brown and Bruce Party 
jareds a practicing lawyer and Bruce is 

7
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:29,420
a professor at Queen's University in the
law school there.

8
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:30,254
And I met them both when we were,
when we manifested a mutual interest 

9
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:38,510
last year and bill see 16,
which we all regarded as,

10
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:39,853
um,
a piece of legislation that was 

11
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:46,630
infringing on the rights to free speech 
of Canadian individuals in a manner that

12
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:49,850
hadn't been ever attempted before.
Um,

13
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:54,970
and more recently the Law Society of 
Upper Canada,

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,953
soon to be known as the Law Society of 
Ontario has put forward a requirement 

15
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,430
for all of its members.
So all of the lawyers in Ontario,

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,880
uh,
to produce a document,

17
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,630
a principle that we all have been 
talking about,

18
00:01:11,631 --> 00:01:14,900
the three of us have been talking about 
that we regard as a another,

19
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:17,570
but far more egregious example of 
compelled speech.

20
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,403
So I'm going to let jared introduce 
himself and say a little bit about who 

21
00:01:21,411 --> 00:01:22,244
he is.
He testified with me at the Canadian 

22
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,440
Senate last year.
Bruce Party also testified at the Senate

23
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:28,274
on Bill See 16,
and Bruce was also the lawyer that I 

24
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:31,694
debated.
He played devil's advocate at Queen's 

25
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:36,140
university at some of you watching this 
will be familiar with that video.

26
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:38,360
So jared,
I'll let you introduce yourself.

27
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:41,840
And then Bruce and then Bruce Bruce 
recently wrote a column for the,

28
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:45,440
now she'll post on this new requirement 
by the law society.

29
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:50,330
And so we're going to let him begin the 
discussion proper onto you.

30
00:01:50,331 --> 00:01:51,164
Jared.

31
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,560
I'm a an everyday litigator.
I'm a commercial litigator in Toronto.

32
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,230
Uh,
I've been practicing for about 15 years,

33
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,093
um,
doing increasingly more and more human 

34
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,760
rights tribunal work,
um,

35
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,520
things like that.
Um,

36
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,220
and obviously stepped into the breach on
[inaudible].

37
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,800
And as far as I can tell,
uh,

38
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:10,634
I may have been the only practicing 
lawyer that actually spoke out against 

39
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:16,280
the legislation.
Um,

40
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,340
there were certainly a lot of lawyers,
a including the Canadian bar association

41
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:20,420
that were,
uh,

42
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,960
arraigned in favor of the legislation.
But as far as I can tell,

43
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,100
uh,
boots on the ground,

44
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:27,320
I think I was the only one.
Um,

45
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,450
so I've got a pretty benign practice,
but,

46
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:31,520
um,
but certainly if a

47
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,720
taking up the fight if you will.

48
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,663
Okay.

49
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,793
Bruce.

50
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,340
Thanks Jordan.
Uh,

51
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,203
well this,
this issue arose for me a couple of 

52
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,583
weeks ago when I received an email from 
the law society and all lawyers get 

53
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:49,350
these emails,
uh,

54
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,343
to do various things.
But this was different because it 

55
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:54,760
announced a new requirement for this 
year.

56
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,483
Uh,
jared I think was aware of this 

57
00:02:58,031 --> 00:02:59,090
developing,
uh,

58
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,380
before I was,
but,

59
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,050
but like many other lawyers in the 
province,

60
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:03,720
this is supposed to the first indication
that,

61
00:03:03,721 --> 00:03:04,554
uh,
this new requirement existed and 

62
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,830
essentially email said,
um,

63
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,173
one of the things that said amongst 
others was that every licensed lawyer 

64
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:15,664
now is required to draft and submit what
they are calling a statement of 

65
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:24,280
principles.
And that statement is,

66
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,330
is,
uh,

67
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,900
required to express your agreement and 
the value you place on inclusion,

68
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,773
diversity and equality,
and the fact that you will actively 

69
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:43,231
promote those values.
And that's me just sprung off the screen

70
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,770
as,
uh,

71
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,660
a,
uh,

72
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,910
an outrageous example of forced speech 
out,

73
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:55,180
the same kind that we were talking about
under [inaudible] 16.

74
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,530
But,
but worse,

75
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,050
uh,
this one actually requires you to make a

76
00:03:59,051 --> 00:03:59,884
full fledged statement that will be 
subject to their approval in order to 

77
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:09,310
maintain your license.
In other words,

78
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,110
this is not a matter of it being 
suggested to you that you might ought to

79
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,003
want to do this.
This is a condition of your ability to 

80
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:20,710
practice law in the province of Ontario.
So,

81
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,260
uh,
this district,

82
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:26,020
me as a matter that,
uh,

83
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,670
needed to be aired publicly,
I needed to be discussed amongst lawyers

84
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:35,010
in the province because this is a slow 
march to a dark place,

85
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,000
I think.
And that's where it all began.

86
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:37,951
Yeah.
Well,

87
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:41,010
it was concerning to me when I 
encountered this.

88
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,203
I mean,
I'm the member of a college as well at 

89
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:44,424
college of psychologists.
And my sense of this is that if the 

90
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:49,590
lawyers full and,
and,

91
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,543
and go along with this,
the probability that this will be 

92
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:57,390
required of every professional in 
Ontario and then very rapidly,

93
00:04:57,391 --> 00:05:02,391
every profession in Canada is extremely 
high because if some lawyers who are,

94
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,773
you know,
relatively disagreeable bunch and who 

95
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:06,234
are very familiar with the law and with 
common law in general are willing to 

96
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:13,860
have their political beliefs dictated to
them by their college,

97
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,723
then the probability that the rest of us
will be able to withstand that I think 

98
00:05:17,971 --> 00:05:20,550
is extremely low.
So a strong,

99
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,700
a strong independent bar is always 
supposed to

100
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,613
be the defense or at least one line of 
defense against tyranny or against 

101
00:05:26,841 --> 00:05:28,340
government overreach.
And,

102
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:29,870
and by,
uh,

103
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,740
having the lawyers under the guise of 
their regulatory body,

104
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,860
um,
being compelled to speak or,

105
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:39,140
or share opinions,
um,

106
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,110
it's obviously something scary and I 
think it's something that lawyers should

107
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:45,530
wake up to and they need to push back 
against compelled speech,

108
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:48,090
which was obviously the issue on see 16,
um,

109
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,320
is a particularly nefarious,
um,

110
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,090
infringement and intrusion.

111
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,263
Yeah,
well it's,

112
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,740
I mean it's one thing to put 
restrictions on what people say.

113
00:05:57,741 --> 00:06:00,830
I mean I know you can't incite someone 
to crime for example.

114
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,250
Um,
but it's a completely different thing to

115
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:08,390
require people to espouse a particular 
political stance,

116
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,920
especially when the,
when,

117
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,813
when it's being reviewed by what's 
essentially an arbitrary committee and 

118
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,960
when the punishment is so as draconian 
as,

119
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,123
as potentially losing your right to 
practice and that that's enforced as a 

120
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:23,924
mandatory,
like the first step was to make that 

121
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,370
mandatory rather than as a suggestion.

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,540
So let's,
let's just emphasize this point that the

123
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,390
distinction between restrictions on 
speech,

124
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,553
which,
which are not with things and are 

125
00:06:38,971 --> 00:06:39,804
debatable and so on.
But this is a different category of 

126
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:42,980
question.
This is compelled speech.

127
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:47,480
This is a requirement that makes you say
something you may not agree with.

128
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,703
And uh,
I mentioned it'll be at the column I 

129
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,843
statements from the Supreme Court of 
Canada and maybe I'll just read out one 

130
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:56,810
of those gyms too,
just to make the point.

131
00:06:56,811 --> 00:07:00,830
Because even if the court has said 
explicitly that,

132
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,360
uh,
that this is,

133
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,840
this is not on in a,
in a free society,

134
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,220
you're hear the words of the Supreme 
Court,

135
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,240
uh,
forcing someone to express opinions that

136
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:15,410
they do not have is to tell Alterian and
as such,

137
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,070
alien to the tradition of free nations 
like Canada,

138
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,310
even for the repression of the most 
serious crimes,

139
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,550
which of course is not in Preston here.
Yeah,

140
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,853
I mean that was cool.

141
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,280
Sorry Jordan.
That was,

142
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,840
that was the cornerstone of not only the
opinion piece that I,

143
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,090
I put up on my website about 
[inaudible],

144
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,920
but also in the cornerstone of the 
presentation that was made to the Senate

145
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:41,921
is that this is a particularly egregious
infringement on freedom of expression.

146
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,213
Uh,
you're having to mouth opinions and 

147
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:48,290
ideas that may not be your own and the 
government is forcing you to do it.

148
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,740
And then obviously in this incidence,
so you've got your regulatory body,

149
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:52,760
which,
uh,

150
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,770
which holds your license,
uh,

151
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,703
in,
in your ability to carry on the 

152
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:59,150
livelihood in the chosen profession that
you're in.

153
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,970
I'm telling you that you've got to start
voicing these opinions.

154
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:03,941
So,
jared,

155
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,910
when we talked before too,
one of the things that you pointed out,

156
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,890
and Bruce,
you had commented on this as well,

157
00:08:08,891 --> 00:08:10,050
is that,
you know,

158
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,183
the,
the Law Society Administration 

159
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,623
theoretically did some background work 
before deciding that this was a 

160
00:08:16,451 --> 00:08:17,284
necessity.
And they produced a report essentially 

161
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,950
proclaiming that the,
uh,

162
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,143
the law,
the people who are practicing law in 

163
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:30,310
Ontario are essentially racist in their 
orientation,

164
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:35,311
which is why this is racist and perhaps 
misogynist as well,

165
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,920
which is why this piece of 
administrative,

166
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,280
let's call it law or requirements,
has come into practice.

167
00:08:42,281 --> 00:08:46,300
But it isn't obvious that their own data
support that conclusion.

168
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:47,134
I mean,
you can easily read what they wrote as 

169
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,480
pretty providing pretty compelling 
evidence that the legal profession,

170
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,370
the demographics of the legal profession
for what that's worth,

171
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,250
you are transforming quite rapidly.
And so,

172
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,060
um,
the thing that concerned me as well from

173
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:03,894
a psychological perspective about this 
sort of thing is that lawyers who agree 

174
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:08,664
to participate in this process are 
basically admitting their racism and 

175
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:17,490
misogyny on a conscious and unconscious 
basis and thereby convicting themselves.

176
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,500
Like they're,
they're guilty to begin with.

177
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:20,334
They,
and they don't have an opportunity to 

178
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,310
prove their innocence.
And by,

179
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,383
by going along with these requirements,
they're basically admitting through 

180
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:28,494
their action that the accusations that 
are being thrown at them both 

181
00:09:32,131 --> 00:09:32,964
individually and as a collective are,
are not only accurate but require 

182
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:38,370
immediate remediation.

183
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,191
Yeah,
well,

184
00:09:40,191 --> 00:09:41,310
I mean the,
the,

185
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,163
uh,
the rec or the requirement that's a 

186
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,790
being rolled out right now as the result
of a,

187
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,683
I think it's about a 58 page report that
had 13 recommendations that were passed 

188
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,424
by convocation,
which is the governing body of the law 

189
00:09:55,431 --> 00:09:57,050
society.
And the report itself,

190
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,173
uh,
was entitled strategies to address 

191
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,570
issues of systemic racism in the legal 
professions.

192
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,810
I mean,
that statement on its own is saying that

193
00:10:05,811 --> 00:10:06,644
our,
our industry as well as the Law Society 

194
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,360
Organization itself is systemically 
racist.

195
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,250
And,
and clearly that's a to me,

196
00:10:13,251 --> 00:10:15,070
I mean it's uh,
uh,

197
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,270
a very bold statement and one that I 
think,

198
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,810
um,
requires some level of scrutiny.

199
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,280
Um,
you know,

200
00:10:22,281 --> 00:10:23,114
the,
the group that came up with this report 

201
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:27,080
is an esteemed group.
These are all highly respected,

202
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,120
uh,
well accomplished individuals.

203
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:30,140
And,
and you know,

204
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:30,974
there,
there is a body of data that they've 

205
00:10:32,661 --> 00:10:34,340
produced as well as,
um,

206
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,563
some qualitative anecdotal stories as to
some of the issues that are being faced 

207
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:40,040
by,
uh,

208
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,930
by what they call racialized licensees.

209
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,183
I mean,
the data is something that a lot of 

210
00:10:44,571 --> 00:10:45,404
people aren't going to look at,
but I do encourage people to look at it 

211
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:48,164
and see what,
what the basis on that finding that 

212
00:10:50,121 --> 00:10:53,360
we're a systemically racist industry 
and,

213
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,450
and obviously profession.
Um,

214
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,710
I encourage people to look at it,
um,

215
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,900
study the report.
I can assure you that most,

216
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,540
most lawyers won't 58 pages,
uh,

217
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,040
something that happened back in 
December.

218
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:04,761
But it,
there's,

219
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:06,320
um,
there's a lot of shocking,

220
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,603
um,
information in there and there's a 

221
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,250
obviously some shocking findings,
but,

222
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,361
um,
yeah,

223
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:11,950
no,
it's,

224
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,783
it's got me concerned because my,
my industry has now been deemed racist 

225
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:17,600
by the body that governs it.

226
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,761
Yeah.
Yeah.

227
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,594
Well,
one of the things that's really 

228
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:21,544
appalling about that and I think and 
also about the requirements for the 

229
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,680
statement of principles is that there's 
a pronounced ideological bent to them.

230
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,253
Um,
and the first is the idea of systemic 

231
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:39,430
racism because the way that you prove 
systemic racism is,

232
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,630
is,
uh,

233
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:41,464
I would say,
let's say call it questionable 

234
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,493
methodologically to say the least 
because the basic concept is that you 

235
00:11:47,891 --> 00:11:52,891
divide the population up by racial,
ethnic and sex based identification,

236
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,430
which you can do in a very large number 
of ways by the way.

237
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,450
And then you compare any organization,
uh,

238
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,410
to that population based division.
And if the,

239
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,903
the,
uh,

240
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
ratio of individuals categorized in the 
general population isn't the same as the

241
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:13,894
ratio of individuals in that profession,
then you can automatically make a case 

242
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:19,090
for systemic racism.
And that's a very,

243
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:22,840
very weak methodology.
No credible scientist would regard that.

244
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,110
And I would regard that as proof of 
anything.

245
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,260
And worse,
I can't imagine that any,

246
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,950
any claim like that would stand up and 
something resembling a court of law if,

247
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:34,803
if you know,
if it was possible to take a group to 

248
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:37,294
court.
Cause there's all sorts of reasons why 

249
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:41,200
there might be differential 
representation in a group

250
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,523
and that,
and that is assuming that that's what 

251
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:44,524
the data shows.
And in many respects that's actually 

252
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,113
what this data shows.
So I take your point about the 

253
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:55,780
methodology but but even so,
even if you like set that methodology,

254
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:59,690
it's not crystal clear that that's what 
the numbers actually suggestion.

255
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,190
Can I get back for a moment to your,
to your implication point,

256
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,113
I mean I agree that the requirements to 
make this statement in this context 

257
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,783
essentially put,
be interpreted as though you were 

258
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,143
required to make a confession about what
it is you've done wrongly in the past 

259
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:21,640
and what it is you will do now in the 
present to correct it as an individual.

260
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,343
And there is also the,
the the trouble that once you have 

261
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:29,200
written a statement so as to come to 
comply with the requirement,

262
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,513
then you have on the record a statement 
of what it is that you believe and 

263
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,380
thereafter your future actions can be 
compared to that statement.

264
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,423
So as to show that you are not acting in
co in compliance with what you have set 

265
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:47,050
you believe or that on one occasion or 
the other,

266
00:13:47,051 --> 00:13:49,630
you haven't been telling the truth.
So some,

267
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,770
some I've heard some lawyers say in 
response to this requirement that,

268
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,930
oh well this is not a big deal because 
I'll just going to write the statement.

269
00:13:55,931 --> 00:13:56,764
They'll put it in a file,
it'll sit in some corner of the law 

270
00:13:59,111 --> 00:14:00,220
society computer.
And,

271
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,570
and who,
who cares,

272
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,760
it's no big deal,
but it actually,

273
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:04,594
it is a very big deal because they are 
hurting you towards both a certain way 

274
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:13,000
to think,
a certain way to express yourself and I,

275
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:17,110
and a certain restriction on your 
behavior and your expression in terms of

276
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,200
how you,
what,

277
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,043
what you say you believe in the future 
about this kind of law and all kinds of 

278
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:24,244
other loans,

279
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,710
but also your subs.
You're subscribing to this idea that the

280
00:14:27,711 --> 00:14:30,080
system is racist,
that the,

281
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,470
that the industry and the profession 
themselves are racist.

282
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,680
And that to me that implies hopelessly 
corrupt.

283
00:14:36,681 --> 00:14:39,160
And I,
and that shocks me and I don't think I,

284
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:41,300
I want my industry,
uh,

285
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,420
advertising that unless of course,
you know,

286
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:45,254
we've got an issue here and,
and it's not entirely clear to me from 

287
00:14:48,381 --> 00:14:50,510
reading the report that we do.
Um,

288
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,280
but I,
Jordan May have some comments

289
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,113
obviously about writing,
writing a statement and the declaration 

290
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:57,590
and what that means,
but I just find that,

291
00:14:57,591 --> 00:15:00,200
you know,
having to affirm in a statement that,

292
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:01,280
uh,
our industry is,

293
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,810
is hopelessly corrupt,
is,

294
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:03,644
um,
it's not something I'm willing to do at 

295
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:06,254
this point.
One of the things I've learned after 

296
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,013
over the last year is that apologizing 
or admitting guilt to ideologues is an 

297
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:17,090
unbelievably dangerous thing to do 
because all it's taken as,

298
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,170
as Bruce Basically alluded to,
is a statement of guilt.

299
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,633
And you know,
the other problem from a psychological 

300
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:26,270
perspective is that,
and this,

301
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:29,180
this is a very clear psychological 
literature on this.

302
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:30,200
So,
you know,

303
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:34,250
if you have a particular set of 
philosophical positions,

304
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:36,410
let's say principles,
let's call them,

305
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,140
and maybe your principles or something 
like excellence,

306
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:39,974
meritocracy and honesty,
which strike me as a better set of 

307
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:46,580
principles for lawyers than diversity,
equity and inclusiveness.

308
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,770
Not that those aren't,
you know,

309
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:51,470
in in certain context and carefully 
defined.

310
00:15:51,471 --> 00:15:53,300
Also important.
Um,

311
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,373
if you write a statement of principle,
especially one that's going to have to 

312
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:58,034
pass muster,
then what will happen is you will bring 

313
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:04,670
your beliefs and your actions in line 
with that statement of principle.

314
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,120
You'll do that unconsciously.
And there's a bunch of reasons for that.

315
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:08,954
And one reason is,
is that you've now made a coherent and 

316
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:15,290
credible argument in favor of that set 
of principles.

317
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,124
And you will find that convincing 
because articulating yourself in that 

318
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:23,110
manner actually changes your character.
And the second is,

319
00:16:23,111 --> 00:16:27,080
is that it puts you in into a position 
that's,

320
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,940
um,
that's,

321
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,060
that's often been described as cognitive
dissonance,

322
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:34,220
which is one of the most famous findings
in,

323
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,523
in psychology.
And cognitive dissonance is the UN on a 

324
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,220
pleasant feeling that you get when 
you're holding two opposing beliefs,

325
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:44,570
let's say at the same time.

326
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,403
And you notice that.
And so the cognitive dissonance here 

327
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:48,410
would be,
well,

328
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,570
I'm just going to write this statement 
of principles.

329
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:53,090
What difference does it make?
But however,

330
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:55,760
that is a statement of principles.
And so it's,

331
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:56,594
it's intrinsically dishonest and,
and character damaging to craft a 

332
00:17:00,981 --> 00:17:03,740
statement of Principles with which you 
do not agree.

333
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,873
And so then you can either regard 
yourself as a coward and a liar or you 

334
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,433
bring your thinking in line with the 
statement of principles and that the 

335
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:14,960
latter thing is what people tend to do.
And so,

336
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,440
and then the idea that this is just 
going to sit in some musty,

337
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,670
uh,
file drawer.

338
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:22,760
That's completely,
that's completely naive in my estimation

339
00:17:22,761 --> 00:17:23,594
because basically what's happening,
and I've seen this happening with the 

340
00:17:25,851 --> 00:17:29,060
creep of ethics committees on university
campuses,

341
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:33,680
is that once you decide that you're 
guilty and that you're going to abide by

342
00:17:33,681 --> 00:17:34,514
a new set of principles,
it now becomes incumbent on the law 

343
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:42,110
society as a matter of the intrinsic 
logic of the,

344
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,093
of the movement to do things like check 
you out on a year to year basis to see 

345
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,860
how your attitude and behavior is.
Uh,

346
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,310
actually in keeping with your statement 
of principles,

347
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,290
it's not just going to hang there in the
air,

348
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,243
it's going to be enforced.
And that is part of the transition I 

349
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:05,361
would say from the law society,
regulating competence,

350
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,343
regulating values.
I mean it used to be at one point the 

351
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,513
last study was there to make sure that 
you had the skills to be able to 

352
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:17,000
practice law and as time has gone on 
there,

353
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:20,010
there,
there are overseeing is more and more in

354
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:20,844
the area what it is that you sync and 
whether or not that thinking is 

355
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:24,744
appropriate.
And one good comparison of this is the 

356
00:18:27,511 --> 00:18:28,344
uh,
the case involving the Trinity Western 

357
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,513
Law School of the,
the uh,

358
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,613
graduates of that law school.
So this is a private law school that 

359
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:38,880
would be in bridge and they require all 
their,

360
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,840
all their faculty and students to sign 
on to a pledge that had,

361
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:43,980
contains certain values.

362
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,470
They promised not to do certain things 
like have premarital sex and,

363
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,620
and uh,
all kinds of other things.

364
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,993
The law society on the basis,
I think that it is inappropriate for an 

365
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:57,654
institution to impose values upon the 
people within it have said that they 

366
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:04,650
will not license graduates from the 
possible.

367
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,730
Now you might agree or disagree with 
that perspective,

368
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,893
but it is different critical now that 
what they have done is the same thing 

369
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,150
essentially except with a different set 
of values.

370
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,223
They have indeed imposed instead of 
values on the people within their own 

371
00:19:22,951 --> 00:19:23,784
institution.
It's just that they haven't chosen 

372
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:27,270
different values,
which means that their objection to turn

373
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:28,104
to your question,
it was not really at all about the 

374
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:30,354
position of the values.
They just don't like the values that 

375
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,630
attorney Western chosen.
Yeah.

376
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,473
What,
it's pretty ironic that the argument 

377
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:38,844
would be made that an organization 
doesn't have the right to impose its 

378
00:19:41,851 --> 00:19:42,240
value.

379
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,760
So when it's on it's voluntary 
participants,

380
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:45,594
which we should point out because you 
certainly don't have to go to Trinity 

381
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,893
Western or signed the agreement.
There's lots of law schools you can go 

382
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,580
to where he's in this particular 
situation.

383
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,773
You're basically,
I mean to say that a gun is pointed to 

384
00:19:57,361 --> 00:20:01,590
your head is too dramatic obviously,
but it's no joke to be faced with it.

385
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,663
With the threat of losing your license 
and also to have to undergo what would 

386
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:09,210
essentially be a bureaucratic 
inquisition and those are not pleasant.

387
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:13,770
Those are seriously not pleasant if you,
if you fail to comply.

388
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,900
No.
And there's other,

389
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,200
there's other parts of this before we 
leave Trinity Western,

390
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:20,820
can we just underline what you just 
said,

391
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:21,654
which I think is very important,
which is that that the law society is 

392
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:30,510
essentially an arm of the state.
It has coercive power given to it by the

393
00:20:30,511 --> 00:20:33,810
state to license lawyers and it is the 
gatekeeper,

394
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,760
so you have no choice.
Whereas as,

395
00:20:36,761 --> 00:20:37,740
as you said,
Jordan,

396
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,120
the they association with Trinity 
Western is entirely voluntary.

397
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,130
If you don't want to go to that school,
you don't go to that school.

398
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,920
And so it's,
it's,

399
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,040
it's,
it's ironic in the extreme that

400
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,100
it is the law society,
which is a,

401
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,973
which has imposed such a requirement in 
circumstances that is much more 

402
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:59,290
objectionable than the Trinity Western 
situation.

403
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,863
And it's quite,
it's quite disconcerting to me to say 

404
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:04,264
the least to see that it's actually 
lawyers that are doing this and that 

405
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:07,924
have that and that and that they're not 
capable of seeing or unwilling to see 

406
00:21:12,431 --> 00:21:17,410
for some reasons that I don't really 
understand why that this is an egregious

407
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:19,420
assault on the rights of,
of,

408
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,283
well I would say of of lawyers in 
Ontario but also of individual citizens 

409
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:26,890
in Canada.
It's like the fact that that,

410
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,680
that it's lawyers that are involved in 
this is really,

411
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,760
um,
I find that much more terrifying in some

412
00:21:33,761 --> 00:21:38,761
sense than the unfounded or likely 
unfounded accusation that the entire,

413
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,890
um,
profession is racist,

414
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,300
which are also,
you know,

415
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:48,160
now what are people who are to use the 
hated word racialized,

416
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,163
which is also an ideological term 
supposed to conclude if all the lawyers 

417
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,210
in Ontario,
um,

418
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,240
just go along with this whole,
they're really supposed to be able to go

419
00:21:58,241 --> 00:22:02,170
into a law firm and trust that their,
um,

420
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,690
their claims are going to be put forward
with,

421
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:05,770
with,
with,

422
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,620
with fairness and clarity and 
commitment.

423
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,430
If the whole society is already agreed 
and the lawyers go along with it,

424
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,264
that it's an intrinsically racist 
association and how is that going to do 

425
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:20,110
anything but damage,
racial and,

426
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,820
and,
and sex related.

427
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,410
Um,
what would you call them?

428
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:26,500
Relationships in Canada.
I just can't see that as anything,

429
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:27,334
but you know,
it's supposed to be something that 

430
00:22:28,571 --> 00:22:32,320
brings us together with regards to,
let's call it inclusiveness,

431
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,393
but I can't see this as anything other 
than something that's going to be 

432
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:36,880
extraordinarily divisive.

433
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:38,870
Well,
interesting.

434
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,340
You were,
you were raising the issue of,

435
00:22:40,341 --> 00:22:41,174
of why are lawyers going along with it 
or why aren't they recognizing the 

436
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,110
danger?
Um,

437
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,280
you know,
there was some,

438
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,820
some talk about this at the convocation 
meeting where,

439
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:49,683
where these recommendations were passed.
There were some dissenting voices and 

440
00:22:52,491 --> 00:22:54,920
very,
very well put dissenting voices.

441
00:22:54,921 --> 00:22:56,150
But um,
you know,

442
00:22:56,151 --> 00:23:00,470
just within my own professional network,
most lawyers don't know what's going on.

443
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,290
They got the email.
Um,

444
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,070
they didn't think anything of it.
We get a,

445
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,810
you know,
12 of these things a month.

446
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,360
It's just an additional requirement,
another piece of paper.

447
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,201
Now,
interesting.

448
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:13,070
What the law society has done when they 
pushed this requirement out is they also

449
00:23:13,071 --> 00:23:14,360
said,
by the way,

450
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:16,760
if you need some help completing this 
statement of declar,

451
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,170
uh,
statement of principles,

452
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,140
we're going to provide two templates 
that would satisfy us.

453
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,660
And of course,
98% of the,

454
00:23:23,661 --> 00:23:26,650
the lawyers that I practice with who are
our he time grinds,

455
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,583
what are they gonna do?
They're gonna file it out of their 

456
00:23:28,701 --> 00:23:31,130
template a or B,
get on with their life.

457
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,023
And,
and so it's one of those things where 

458
00:23:33,861 --> 00:23:35,930
you've got time pressed lawyers,
uh,

459
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:36,764
or,
or licensees and you've got a 

460
00:23:37,941 --> 00:23:41,270
bureaucracy adding a new law,
a level of requirement to them,

461
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,520
and they're just going to,
to,

462
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,080
um,
go along to get,

463
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,040
and

464
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,800
from what I can tell,
when I do stop people and ask them about

465
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,873
their statement of principles,
that's the first time they've actually 

466
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:52,700
thought about it.
Yeah,

467
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:58,790
go ahead bruce.
The fact that as a template,

468
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,560
and you can choose between one or up to 
10 points.

469
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,320
Yeah,
that doesn't make it less of a concern.

470
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:09,320
It's actually more,
I don't want to overstate this,

471
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:10,154
but this is,
it has a lot of similarities to 

472
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,490
mccarthyism.
Yes.

473
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:18,790
Cause I don't statement that you know I 
am not now nor have I ever been a member

474
00:24:18,981 --> 00:24:22,760
of the communist party that that was the
templates in the McCarthy era.

475
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,073
It's just a template.
You have to say certain things and and 

476
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,870
look how meaningless it becomes in terms
of actual substance.

477
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,733
If it's a template and you just sign on,
then they have literally put words in 

478
00:24:35,091 --> 00:24:39,350
your mouth and that is the thing that 
cannot be allowed to happen.

479
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,560
I agree with that.
And in a couple of ways.

480
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:43,394
I mean the first thing is is that if 
they were committed to this in any deep 

481
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:47,984
sense,
the last thing they would provide was a 

482
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:49,964
template because the idea that you can,
you can require from people a statement 

483
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:56,144
of principles that's of such fundamental
import that if it is not crafted 

484
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:00,890
properly,
you lose your license.

485
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:05,570
And yet that they could produce a 
template of principles that wouldn't see

486
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:08,330
in some manner apply to everyone 
equally.

487
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:09,830
It's just,
it's absurd.

488
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:11,750
Almost beyond comprehension.
I mean,

489
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,510
principals actually happened to be 
important,

490
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:16,340
right?
From a psychological perspective,

491
00:25:16,341 --> 00:25:17,174
your deepest principles are the axioms 
from which you generate not only your 

492
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:23,420
thoughts and your actions,
but your perceptions,

493
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,910
your emotional responses and your 
motivation.

494
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:26,744
It's like there's virtually nothing more
important from the perspective of 

495
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:34,220
psychological integrity then your 
principles and to think that those could

496
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:35,054
be reduced to an externally produced 
template and that that could be imposed 

497
00:25:39,111 --> 00:25:39,944
as a requirement.

498
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,010
So it would be easier for you is it's 
like it,

499
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,740
it reminds me of the Soviet era where 
there were templates of guilt,

500
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,840
you know,
if you were accused of something,

501
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,810
regardless of whether you were guilty or
not,

502
00:25:53,811 --> 00:25:55,430
because that really wasn't very 
relevant,

503
00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:00,020
you'd be required to sign a template of 
guilt essentially.

504
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:00,854
And that would well,
and once you've done that well you were 

505
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:05,210
done.
And so it's really quite,

506
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:06,044
it's really quite amazing that that from
a conceptual philosophical perspective 

507
00:26:10,551 --> 00:26:14,030
that that sort of thing could even be 
considered for a moment as,

508
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:14,864
as as acceptable.
And it seems to me to be a way of 

509
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,330
sliding it in under the door.
It,

510
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,730
as jared pointed out,
people are busy.

511
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,920
And the other thing is,
you know,

512
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,350
when I made my first videos objecting to
bill,

513
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:28,184
see 16 last year,
part of what motivated me was a comment 

514
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:35,870
by a colleague and about political 
correctness on campuses.

515
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:36,621
And he said,
well,

516
00:26:36,621 --> 00:26:37,454
you know,
the consequence of standing up against 

517
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:42,890
it from a personal perspective is 
extremely,

518
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,710
and the probability that your opposition
to it is going to have a broad scale.

519
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:53,220
A social consequence is very low.
And so the,

520
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,183
the logical thing to do,
especially if you're pressed for time 

521
00:26:56,141 --> 00:26:56,974
and,
and also if you want to not put your 

522
00:26:58,441 --> 00:26:59,274
head up above the herd where it can be 
locked off is to a not notice because 

523
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:05,700
you're too busy.
And B,

524
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,373
because you're isolated as an individual
in this circumstance facing a large 

525
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:12,420
group.
Um,

526
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,313
the easiest thing to do,
especially when you're concerned with 

527
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:16,434
other things,
is just to go along with it because 

528
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:19,260
you're isolated,
right?

529
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:21,180
You don't know if there's other people 
who,

530
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,540
who,
who might be feeling uneasy about this.

531
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:26,070
And there's no real way of telling,

532
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,360
well,
particularly in our profession,

533
00:27:28,361 --> 00:27:29,194
my understanding is that the majority of
lawyers in the province of Ontario are 

534
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:33,850
generally practicing in a small firm 
environment,

535
00:27:33,851 --> 00:27:34,684
are sole practitioners.
And so you're going to have a lot of 

536
00:27:35,981 --> 00:27:37,630
people standing on an island on their 
own,

537
00:27:37,631 --> 00:27:38,464
in their own practice and they're not 
going to fully appreciate that this is 

538
00:27:40,931 --> 00:27:41,850
an issue.
Uh,

539
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,693
what other people are thinking and 
they're absolutely going to think that 

540
00:27:44,561 --> 00:27:46,540
they're putting their head above the 
heard.

541
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,680
Um,
so it,

542
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:48,880
it,
we have a unique,

543
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,700
I think we have a unique industry in 
that regard.

544
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,043
Well,
let's just make it this point at this 

545
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:56,523
moment in time,
which is that all those lawyers who 

546
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:00,514
think that they may be sticking their 
head out all by themselves are actually 

547
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,370
not.
Because you know,

548
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,223
I have certainly heard from a good 
number of lawyers now who are all 

549
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,910
extremely concerned,
shocked,

550
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,833
alarmed at this.
So the one thing that we want to 

551
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:18,034
overcome is the possible inclination to 
think that that any lawyer who is 

552
00:28:22,331 --> 00:28:23,164
concerned about this is an army of one.
And that in this situation is not the 

553
00:28:27,671 --> 00:28:28,990
case.
So there,

554
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,390
there,
there are possibilities here that if,

555
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,980
if people do act upon their concerns 
and,

556
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,060
and,
uh,

557
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,953
decline to comply with this requirement,
that the change in this situation 

558
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:44,980
actually is a possibility.

559
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,001
Well,
bruce,

560
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:47,380
there's also the,
the uh,

561
00:28:47,381 --> 00:28:48,550
the people that,
uh,

562
00:28:48,551 --> 00:28:49,870
that we're servicing.
I mean,

563
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,720
in the private practice world,
clients,

564
00:28:52,721 --> 00:28:55,360
the clients are going to watch this.
They want to know what we're doing.

565
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,403
I think they want their,
their lawyers to stand up on their 

566
00:28:58,481 --> 00:28:59,650
principles,
if you will,

567
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:00,603
and push back against something.
And I think that there's something to 

568
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:03,124
be,
to be said in terms of your 

569
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,660
differentiation in the marketplace,
particularly in private practice,

570
00:29:07,661 --> 00:29:11,080
if you do exactly that.
My clients were relying on me to be this

571
00:29:11,081 --> 00:29:14,260
bulwark against this type of thing.
And I think a lot of lawyers should,

572
00:29:14,261 --> 00:29:15,590
uh,
should take note of that.

573
00:29:15,591 --> 00:29:17,620
That,
that there might be something here worth

574
00:29:17,621 --> 00:29:18,454
fighting for.

575
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,880
Yeah,
I totally agree.

576
00:29:19,881 --> 00:29:20,890
I mean,
really your,

577
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,880
your lawyer credibility is at stake 
here.

578
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:27,910
You can't stand up and protect herself.
When your own fundamental rights are,

579
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,510
are,
are being threatened,

580
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:34,540
then why should clients believe you have
the ability to do so on their map?

581
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:37,280
No,
the inclination to do so.

582
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,160
You know,
because by swollen we can just hook,

583
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:40,994
line and sinker,
let's say an exceeding to what's 

584
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:45,860
essentially an ideological demand.
Um,

585
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:50,920
then you also brand yourself as an 
Avatar of that particular radiology.

586
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,560
And so that's another reason to not be 
trusted.

587
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,693
You know,
that there's the aspect of inability to 

588
00:29:56,951 --> 00:29:59,080
stand up for yourself or unwillingness 
to,

589
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:04,081
but then the two to come out as a,
as an active agent for this,

590
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:08,020
for this particular set of,
of let's call them principles,

591
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:08,781
which,
and,

592
00:30:08,781 --> 00:30:13,240
and there's absolutely no reason to make
the assumption that the whole,

593
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:17,530
the new holy trinity of diversity,
equity and inclusiveness constitutes the

594
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:19,740
highest order of moral value.
It's,

595
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:20,643
in fact,
I think it's an extraordinarily weak 

596
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:23,230
argument.
If that's the case,

597
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:24,064
there's,
there's flaws in it at virtually every 

598
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:27,490
level of analysis.
So,

599
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:31,120
and it certainly runs contrary to the 
central themes of,

600
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,860
of,
of English common law,

601
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:33,730
for example.

602
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:39,340
So we make note just for a moment,
the fact that the law society is playing

603
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,133
a little bit close to their chest in the
sense that they have not spelled out 

604
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,630
what the penalty is going to be for 
those lawyers who declined to,

605
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,563
to comply with this requirement.
They've only sit and their materials 

606
00:30:53,421 --> 00:30:54,254
that those lawyers who are not 
compliance will be advised of their 

607
00:30:57,951 --> 00:30:58,784
obligations in writing,
which of course leaves all the choices 

608
00:31:01,911 --> 00:31:03,490
open to the law society.

609
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,700
Well,
and that was discussed,

610
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:06,683
uh,
to some extent at the convocation 

611
00:31:08,391 --> 00:31:10,370
meeting.
There was concerns what happens,

612
00:31:10,371 --> 00:31:13,160
what is the recourse here and,
and I,

613
00:31:13,161 --> 00:31:13,994
I'm left to speculate,
but what your obligations are typically 

614
00:31:16,581 --> 00:31:17,414
is to file what's called the Mendel 
member's annual report of which this is 

615
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:20,744
going to be a component of it by not 
filling out a portion of your member's 

616
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,464
annual report.
I'm sure that you're going to face at a 

617
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:29,960
minimum what's called an administrative 
processor suspension.

618
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,320
And it may even turn into something much
larger than that.

619
00:31:33,321 --> 00:31:34,154
So,
I mean,

620
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,143
I'm speculating,
but absolutely the Law Society did not 

621
00:31:37,101 --> 00:31:41,630
make clear what's going to happen if,
if somebody decides that they don't want

622
00:31:41,631 --> 00:31:43,670
to go along to get along.

623
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,043
Yeah.
Well that's also rather troublesome in 

624
00:31:46,941 --> 00:31:47,960
and of itself,
you know,

625
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,530
because it's,
it's just not reasonable to,

626
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,580
to specify a requirement and then leave 
the penalty undefined.

627
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:56,923
And it smacks of political opportunism 
from my perspective because it means 

628
00:32:00,771 --> 00:32:01,604
that the law society hasn't put itself 
on the line with regards to the degree 

629
00:32:04,941 --> 00:32:08,750
to which they're going to be draconian 
about this and then can incrementally,

630
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:13,400
um,
introduced the penalties on a per person

631
00:32:13,401 --> 00:32:14,234
basis,
which is where you would get the least 

632
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:16,184
amount of pushback too.
Because if you're a professional and 

633
00:32:18,351 --> 00:32:23,030
then the board goes after you like it's 
a horrifying experience and especially,

634
00:32:23,031 --> 00:32:23,864
you know,
it puts your family livelihood and your 

635
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:26,444
reputation online and it's very 
expensive to deal with and time 

636
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:33,290
consuming and troublesome and an anxiety
provoking and all of those things.

637
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:37,580
So you have someone who's immediately 
put in a tremendous position of weakness

638
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:40,790
in order to to say push back against 
this.

639
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,340
When the law society,
it's all public as well.

640
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:44,220
So I mean the,
the,

641
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,630
the role of the law society from what I 
understand is to protect the public from

642
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:48,464
the big bad lawyers.
That's why we are a self regulating 

643
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:52,100
industry.
And one of the things that,

644
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:53,990
uh,
that the law society does is it has,

645
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,690
it makes its disciplinary process 
public.

646
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,300
So things like administrative 
suspensions or,

647
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,750
or disciplinary action are things that 
would be known to the public.

648
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:03,584
So you're out there potentially being 
tarred and feathered on this thing and 

649
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,243
people are going to know,

650
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,413
yeah,
well and to streamline important for a 

651
00:33:09,831 --> 00:33:12,380
professional to maintain a pristine 
reputation.

652
00:33:12,381 --> 00:33:14,560
And even the,
what,

653
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,990
what would you call it?
Even the suggestion that you're known in

654
00:33:17,991 --> 00:33:18,824
accordance with even an administrative 
detail with regards to the law society 

655
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,173
is you can imagine that that's going to 
put doubt in the mind of anyone who 

656
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,910
called,
knows you or doesn't know you.

657
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,850
So that means the process is the 
punishment.

658
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:32,684
And that's very much the case with these
mid level organizations where it seems 

659
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,800
to me that proclivity for,
uh,

660
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,903
uh,
more totalitarian view of the world is 

661
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:47,000
like leaping forward in leaps and or in 
leaps and bounds.

662
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,560
So,
so,

663
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:53,660
so we consider for a moment what we 
might suggest to all the lawyers who are

664
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:57,650
concerned about this and don't want to 
go along with the requirement what it is

665
00:33:57,651 --> 00:34:01,070
that what we wouldn't suggest that they 
do.

666
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,010
Jared,
do you want to take them off?

667
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,040
Well,
it seems to be you approach that in your

668
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:06,420
article,
the national post in,

669
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:07,770
in a,
in a pretty adept way.

670
00:34:07,771 --> 00:34:10,230
And that,
and my first inclination is that is that

671
00:34:10,231 --> 00:34:11,580
you don't file,
I mean,

672
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:14,520
the act of filing in itself as we've 
already discussed is,

673
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,040
is half of the admission of guilt,
if you will.

674
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,450
Um,
and I mean,

675
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,363
uh,
I think that not filing sense sends a 

676
00:34:21,361 --> 00:34:22,590
good,
a good statement,

677
00:34:22,591 --> 00:34:23,870
but then,
you know,

678
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,700
you want to obviously let them know why 
you're not filing.

679
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:29,820
So perhaps you have to send something 
that would let them,

680
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,103
the law society,
the regulator know why you're not 

681
00:34:32,521 --> 00:34:34,140
filing.
I mean those are the things that come to

682
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:36,420
mind and you,
you discuss them I think quite well.

683
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,330
So it's what I do too.
For them to realize that you didn't just

684
00:34:40,331 --> 00:34:43,210
forget,
you actually consciously decided that it

685
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:44,650
wasn't a thing that you were going to 
do.

686
00:34:44,651 --> 00:34:46,630
I think that's a very good idea.
Yes.

687
00:34:46,631 --> 00:34:49,000
I'm kind of short statement but not,
I mean,

688
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:54,360
I wouldn't be inclined to suggest that 
they should draft their own statement of

689
00:34:54,881 --> 00:34:57,430
principles that reflects what they 
actually think,

690
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:58,953
uh,
because then they are actually going 

691
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:04,600
three quarters of the way of what,
of what they've been asked to do.

692
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,980
I mean,
there's no reason why,

693
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:06,843
even if they've been says something that
you believe that you should be filing 

694
00:35:09,851 --> 00:35:10,900
it.
Uh,

695
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,480
because it's still forced speech.
They're still requiring him to make that

696
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:15,000
statement.
So yes.

697
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,060
And it's not a,
it's none of their business.

698
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,020
And,
and I mean,

699
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:21,470
I thought about that myself.
I thought maybe you do a google memo,

700
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,090
you know,
Demora more Google memo,

701
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,170
but then I thought,
no,

702
00:35:24,171 --> 00:35:25,520
you're,
you're playing the game.

703
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:28,390
You are,
you are declaring your thoughts to,

704
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,040
to the regulator.
And I think that's reprehensible.

705
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,700
Yes,
I agree.

706
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,860
They don't have any right to the content
of your thoughts,

707
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,880
not unless you're to voluntarily put 
them forward.

708
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:43,110
And that's definitely a difference.
A very big difference between,

709
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,213
well,
the assessment of competence which has 

710
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:46,074
already taken place after you've passed 
the bar and you're in compliance with 

711
00:35:49,111 --> 00:35:50,130
the,
uh,

712
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,113
with the regulatory boards requirements 
and the idea that they should have 

713
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,290
privileged access to your deepest 
principles is,

714
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,920
I agree that's absolutely reprehensible.
There's no excuse for it whatsoever.

715
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,593
Whether you,
whether you agree with the principles 

716
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:06,510
they want you to agree with or not and 
it's reprehensible.

717
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,583
Yes.
Oh yes.

718
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,460
Let's emphasize this point.
Oh,

719
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,243
this is,
this is essentially a debate about 

720
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,863
whether or not those values are,
are good or bad or desirable or 

721
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:18,554
undesirable.
This is about the forced speech first 

722
00:36:20,751 --> 00:36:24,020
and foremost.
But the idea that you can be required to

723
00:36:24,021 --> 00:36:27,470
indicate how you feel about them and you
agree with some,

724
00:36:27,471 --> 00:36:28,304
an endorsement zone,
even if you do agree with them and 

725
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:33,540
endorse them,
the idea that you must have to say so it

726
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,670
is,
is just not on it.

727
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,450
It crosses a line into a dark place that
that,

728
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,583
uh,
does not bode well for the future of 

729
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:46,870
freedom of speech in this country.
Yes,

730
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,530
the rules go ahead and drink

731
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,850
the rules of professional conduct for 
lawyers,

732
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,733
um,
already have a rule that requires us to 

733
00:36:55,281 --> 00:37:00,281
act in accordance with the Human Rights 
Code and principles of,

734
00:37:00,341 --> 00:37:01,610
of uh,
um,

735
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,130
not to discriminate I guess is the word 
I'm using.

736
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:09,100
And so clearly our actions are already 
governed by a code of conduct and,

737
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,030
and,
and by the legislation generally.

738
00:37:11,031 --> 00:37:13,790
So for them to,
to request the statement of principles,

739
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,460
it really is just asking you to the way 
you think.

740
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,440
And so it's not like,

741
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:22,040
it's not like this is needed.
It's like it's,

742
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:27,040
it's the distinction between your 
obligation to comply with the law and to

743
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:29,230
state that you agree with the law.
Which again,

744
00:37:29,231 --> 00:37:30,860
going back to the Supreme Court of 
Canada is,

745
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,400
is our,
are two quite different things.

746
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:36,100
I read again what the Supreme Court said
on this question.

747
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,353
Three court says this,
however admirable the objectives and 

748
00:37:43,991 --> 00:37:44,824
provisions of the law.
Maybe no one is obliged to approve of 

749
00:37:49,031 --> 00:37:50,410
them.
Anyone.

750
00:37:50,411 --> 00:37:54,790
May criticize them and seek to have them
amended or repealed,

751
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:59,350
although complying with them so long as 
there are ineffective.

752
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,730
So this is not a question of whether 
lawyers are subject to human rights code

753
00:38:03,731 --> 00:38:05,320
and antidiscrimination laws.
That is,

754
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,183
that is not the question here.
The question is whether or not you are 

755
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:11,860
required to endorse them and say that 
you agree,

756
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,210
which is quite a different thing.

757
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,480
The other thing that disturbs me about 
this,

758
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,713
and I suppose this is a consequence of 
my experience with delving deeply into 

759
00:38:22,241 --> 00:38:27,241
the history of places like the Soviet 
Union in its early stages of development

760
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:31,090
is that there's a class based guilt 
phenomena that's,

761
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,013
that's,
that's lurking at the bottom of this 

762
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:34,624
too,
which is also absolutely I would say 

763
00:38:36,491 --> 00:38:39,640
terrifying.
So let's just say for a moment,

764
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,563
although I don't believe this,
that there is systemic racism among 

765
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:49,960
lawyers defined the way that this sort 
of thing is defined.

766
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,650
Um,
but what this requirement,

767
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,153
um,
implies is that every single lawyer of 

768
00:38:58,241 --> 00:39:02,740
that group is now guilty of that 
phenomena,

769
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:08,350
merely sb and merely as a consequence of
being a member of that class of people.

770
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,540
And you know,
there is something,

771
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,583
the idea of class based guilt is,
well first of all it's the basis for 

772
00:39:15,881 --> 00:39:17,350
racism itself,
right?

773
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,360
So,
but it's,

774
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,253
it's a terrifying proposition from the 
perspective of a informed Western 

775
00:39:24,251 --> 00:39:27,690
individual because one of the bedrock,
uh,

776
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,320
uh,
presuppositions,

777
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,260
let's call it a principle of our legal 
structure,

778
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:36,100
is that you're judged on your guilt or 
innocence as an individual,

779
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:38,800
not as the member of a class.
And believe me,

780
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:41,980
that is not a road we want to walk down 
because there's,

781
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:42,941
you know,
each of us,

782
00:39:42,941 --> 00:39:43,774
it might be the members of six or seven 
different classes and if you look into 

783
00:39:47,681 --> 00:39:50,260
the history,
let's say of those classes,

784
00:39:50,261 --> 00:39:51,580
whatever they are,
economic,

785
00:39:51,581 --> 00:39:52,960
professional,
racial,

786
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,820
gender based,
whatever,

787
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,730
the probability that sometime in the 
past,

788
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:58,564
some members of our so called class did 
things that were morally reprehensible 

789
00:40:02,591 --> 00:40:03,424
or illegal is 100% and if we're going to
be judged on the basis of the actions 

790
00:40:08,921 --> 00:40:09,754
taken by people that we didn't even know
merely because we happen to be vaguely 

791
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:14,134
associated with that group,
then we're all guilty of all sorts of 

792
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:20,710
terrible things all the time.
And that puts us completely in the hands

793
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:22,500
of people who want to make those guilt 
bay,

794
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:25,530
those group guilt based accusations and 
that's,

795
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,270
that's a very,
very bad,

796
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:31,360
it's almost impossible to overstress how
bad an idea that is.

797
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,500
Yes,
absolutely.

798
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,363
I mean there,
there is no one that you can't identify 

799
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:43,470
who in terms of group association and in
terms of of lineage as well.

800
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:48,530
I mean this is also a casting the net 
back into history to see if you know,

801
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,870
which,
which group did wrong to,

802
00:40:51,871 --> 00:40:53,300
to which group.
But of course there,

803
00:40:53,301 --> 00:40:58,301
there is no one who doesn't have 
somewhere in their ancestral lineage,

804
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,760
you know,
wrongs done by somebody you related to,

805
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:04,690
to some other person.
And if,

806
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,130
if that is the record is the criteria 
for guilt as you have said,

807
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,970
then everybody is guilty and the whole 
thing starts to become silicon.

808
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,243
Yes.
Well when everyone's guilty that means 

809
00:41:14,631 --> 00:41:18,530
that the people who hold the right to 
punishment become all powerful.

810
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,990
Yes.
And all discretionary to yes.

811
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,080
That,
at least in Soviet Russia,

812
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:23,914
they,
they'd prime you up and torture you a 

813
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,020
bit before they had you swear your 
statement of a,

814
00:41:27,021 --> 00:41:29,500
of principles or your confession,
if you will.

815
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,021
So,
okay.

816
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:36,470
So here's another thing that I thought I
might do is I'm going to put together an

817
00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:38,940
anonymous list.
Um,

818
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:43,370
so that lawyers who are willing to 
indicate their,

819
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,593
um,
objections to this requirement can sign 

820
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:49,064
up.
And that way I can tweet and also stay 

821
00:41:51,021 --> 00:41:53,270
in contact with you guys on a regular 
basis,

822
00:41:53,271 --> 00:41:58,040
how many signatories I've obtained and I
won't make that public.

823
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:00,560
I'll make sure that it's not crackable.
And,

824
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,423
um,
that way it'll help people discover how 

825
00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:07,304
many other people are also concerned 
about this and indicate to what degree 

826
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,223
there might be strength in numbers.
And so I'll set that up very carefully 

827
00:42:15,591 --> 00:42:18,590
and I'll put the link to that in the 
description of this video.

828
00:42:18,591 --> 00:42:22,100
And so I guess we've decided on three 
potential,

829
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,200
um,
modes of action and,

830
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,420
uh,
uh,

831
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:30,560
jareds fundamental suggested,
if I remember correctly,

832
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:31,783
was to not file the statement of 
principle and also write a letter 

833
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:39,980
indicating precisely why.
And I guess that would be,

834
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,153
well it
might be most effective if you filed a 

835
00:42:46,031 --> 00:42:46,864
piece of paper as your fitness but don't
make it a statement just to say on the 

836
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:52,383
statement of principles that you object 
to filing if they can or principles or 

837
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,210
if they wish to call them.
They're more than welcome to just to,

838
00:42:59,211 --> 00:43:01,690
just to send in a copy of the it from 
the National Post.

839
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,793
Anything that,
anything that indicates that you're not 

840
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:07,810
doing this,
you haven't just forgotten,

841
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,160
but there is a piece of paper that is 
filed in place of what they've asked for

842
00:43:12,161 --> 00:43:13,470
but it is not what they've asked for.

843
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,720
Okay,
so that can be very straight forward.

844
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:18,510
That means that it wouldn't necessarily 
be very time consuming.

845
00:43:18,511 --> 00:43:19,344
You could take,
you can take the time to delineate why 

846
00:43:23,131 --> 00:43:26,400
you're opposed to this or you could send
to in Nicola more.

847
00:43:26,401 --> 00:43:28,740
You could just state that you're opposed
to this.

848
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,653
Yeah,
I don't think they should go to great 

849
00:43:31,481 --> 00:43:32,314
lengths.
I think it's very simple and they just 

850
00:43:34,181 --> 00:43:35,014
say something like,
this is forced speech and I choose not 

851
00:43:39,341 --> 00:43:43,000
to comply or send to the column or 
something,

852
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,170
something that that stands for.
The proposition that I'm,

853
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:50,050
I'm declining this request.
And it can be very short.

854
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:54,180
It does not have to be a full reason.
Yeah.

855
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,620
I objected to be justifiable.

856
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,350
Most lawyers know how to do that if 
they've been in a courtroom.

857
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:00,750
Yes,
exactly.

858
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:01,401
Yeah,
that's right.

859
00:44:01,401 --> 00:44:02,234
It should be,
it should be something they're quite 

860
00:44:03,051 --> 00:44:04,730
accustomed to doing.
And so,

861
00:44:04,731 --> 00:44:05,564
and then I'll put up this late for the 
last so that we can start to collect 

862
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,733
signatories and decide who,
and let people know how many people are 

863
00:44:13,701 --> 00:44:14,534
actually,
let's call it philosophically and 

864
00:44:16,311 --> 00:44:19,940
professionally opposed to this 
particular set of maneuvers.

865
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,420
And to be clear,
we don't,

866
00:44:21,421 --> 00:44:25,140
I don't want to know anybody's politics.
I don't want to know anything other than

867
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,350
are they uncomfortable with the idea of 
being compelled to do something,

868
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,700
uh,
to speak something.

869
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:30,211
And I mean,
that's,

870
00:44:30,211 --> 00:44:31,044
that's important and going to be a lot 
of people who are concerned about 

871
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:33,720
anonymity.
And I,

872
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:35,570
I fully respect that.
But,

873
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:36,443
but they need to know that there is 
people out there that are like mindedly 

874
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,100
objecting to this.

875
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,133
Now,
one question obviously that comes up 

876
00:44:44,961 --> 00:44:47,600
about this and I don't,
what do you want to speak to this,

877
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,434
but I understand if there have been 
conversations between lots of various 

878
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:56,830
people about whether or not a legal 
action is a possibility,

879
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,761
uh,
on this,

880
00:44:57,761 --> 00:45:00,050
you'd do you want to just make some very
general comments?

881
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:03,030
I think it's a,
I mean it's,

882
00:45:03,031 --> 00:45:05,060
it,
this may come to a head and I and I have

883
00:45:05,061 --> 00:45:05,894
had discussions with,
with many people within my own 

884
00:45:07,611 --> 00:45:08,444
professional network and I'm trying to 
expand that network and I've had it at 

885
00:45:10,821 --> 00:45:12,770
least one person,
um,

886
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,630
very senior lawyer come forward and say,
I'm prepared to challenge this.

887
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:21,020
I'm prepared to be the person that takes
the slings and arrows,

888
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,940
uh,
through a challenging process.

889
00:45:22,941 --> 00:45:24,050
And,
and I mean,

890
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:27,950
I imagine it would have to flow through 
the law society initially,

891
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,360
but at some point you are entitled to,
to Judicial Review of,

892
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,253
of regulatory decisions.
So it would get pushed out into the 

893
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,400
general court system at some point.
Um,

894
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:39,010
but yeah,
absolutely it can if,

895
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,250
if,
if let's say what,

896
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:43,760
there are people that are willing to,
to go to the mat for this.

897
00:45:43,761 --> 00:45:47,480
And that's what I've been able to a,
to discern just within my own network.

898
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:48,730
Okay.

899
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:49,900
Well that's reassuring.

900
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,590
Well,
it's the way lawyers should be.

901
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,290
We're supposed to be objectionable,
aren't we?

902
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,780
Is we'll put that feature to good.
The good news.

903
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,460
Yes.
Well that's exactly it.

904
00:46:02,461 --> 00:46:04,440
I would say from a temperamental 
perspective,

905
00:46:04,441 --> 00:46:05,274
lawyers are perfectly positioned to do 
that because they tend to be rather 

906
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:08,724
disagreeable and emotionally stable.
And so we do the rest of us and I'm 

907
00:46:12,361 --> 00:46:14,580
speaking as the member of another 
professional,

908
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,920
uh,
um,

909
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:16,823
organization.
We depend on you guys to be the bull 

910
00:46:19,951 --> 00:46:24,660
work against any incursions into our 
essential rights.

911
00:46:24,661 --> 00:46:26,680
And if you guys fold and,
and,

912
00:46:26,681 --> 00:46:30,510
and go along with this,
then it's really not a good day for,

913
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,600
for the English common law,
that's for sure.

914
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:34,434
And I think the English common law is 
one of the most remarkable achievements 

915
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:39,174
of civilization of world civilization.
It's an absolute gift and evolved legal 

916
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:45,000
system.
It works unbelievably well.

917
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,133
And to,
and to not object to serious challenges 

918
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,113
to it at a fundamental level means that 
we deserve whatever restrictions on our 

919
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:57,300
freedoms we accrue as a consequence of 
our cowardice.

920
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:58,883
And to let that happen when we're really
just not paying attention would be the 

921
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:03,960
ultimate tragedy.

922
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:06,013
Okay.
