1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:04,243
I'm not an atheist anymore because I 
don't look at the world that way 

2
00:00:07,761 --> 00:00:10,550
anymore.
I'm not a materialist anymore.

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,100
I don't think the world is made out of 
matter.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,240
I think it's made out of what matters.
It's made out of meaning.

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,133
Look at it from,
uh,

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,930
from the perspective of modern brain 
science,

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,033
what we orient towards unconsciously,
which means what captures our attention 

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,200
is meaning and it captures our attention
before we know what it is the brain acts

9
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:33,770
as if the world is made out of 
information or made out of meaning.

10
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,150
Heidegger,
for example,

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,313
German philosopher was convinced that 
the world was made out of meaning 

12
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:40,334
essentially,
and that people's primary interaction 

13
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:45,164
with being was interaction with meaning 
and that isn't what modern people think 

14
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:50,294
because they're deeply materialistic.
If you go back 400 years or 500 years 

15
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,600
and you look at what people meant when 
they said matter,

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,710
which is what things are made out of,
what they thought mattered was,

17
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,573
isn't like what we think it is.
It wasn't like this material stuff sort 

18
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:07,640
of like dirt that everything was made 
out of.

19
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:10,790
It was.
It was much more complicated than not.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,833
Problem with the standard view of matter
is that it doesn't really deal with the 

21
00:01:15,171 --> 00:01:16,004
fact that matter comes in a raise and in
patterns and the patterns and the 

22
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:20,714
arrays,
which is sort of lost when you think 

23
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:24,530
about Adam's.
That's where all the action is.

24
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,390
That's where the reality is.

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,420
God creates Adam and Eve explicitly in 
his own image.

26
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,750
There's a variety of interpretations 
about the first being that God created,

27
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:38,654
so there's a tradition in medieval 
Christianity and Judaism as well that 

28
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:43,724
the first man was hermaphroditic and 
male and female together and then 

29
00:01:49,011 --> 00:01:49,844
separated into two separate entities 
which then we're forever looking to be 

30
00:01:52,881 --> 00:01:53,714
rejoined and there's a very profound 
psychological idea there which is that 

31
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,280
the union of masculine and feminine 
produces a kind of perfect wholeness and

32
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:05,654
you can think about that as being 
expressed biologically given the males 

33
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:11,570
need females and masculine needs 
feminine.

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,673
But you can also think about it as 
different aspects of the psyche or 

35
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,820
between people or different aspects of 
the psyche within people.

36
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,450
So whatever consciousness,
whatever consciousness is,

37
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,150
it comes in masculine and feminine 
embodiments.

38
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,013
The masculine and the feminine 
embodiment are equally representations 

39
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:31,034
of God,
which I think is quite remarkable 

40
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:33,404
because you know there's a whole line of
feminist criticism of the western 

41
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:36,854
tradition that makes the presumption 
that the whole structure is patriarchal 

42
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,390
and I don't think that's true.

43
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,553
If it was patriarchal,
it would have been man that was created 

44
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:46,634
in the image of God and it is explicitly
not that what feminine and masculine as 

45
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,930
well as being markers for gender 
behavior.

46
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,813
Also symbolic categories and the 
feminine symbolic category is the the 

47
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,723
genet tricks of things.
The Matrix because the female is 

48
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:05,524
associated with the act of with with the
most fundamental aspects of the act of 

49
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,040
reproduction,
so it's out of the feminine.

50
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:12,874
That new form spring for example,
new forms come out of what you don't 

51
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:21,880
understand and that's the matrix of 
being and new biological forms come come

52
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:22,714
out of a feminine substrate that's 
female creatures and so the masculine 

53
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,150
aspect is more seminal in in a symbolic 
sense of that.

54
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,920
The seminal idea is the instigator,
so to speak,

55
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:36,754
and it's also.
It also stands in mythology for a kind 

56
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:40,564
of logical clarity and cutting,
whereas the feminine stands for more 

57
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:47,680
like something that's whole and 
undifferentiated.

58
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,933
There's some suggestion in the story of 
Adam and Eve that the woman is the 

59
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:52,354
primary food sharer and I think that's 
associated in some way with her ability 

60
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,920
to make Adam self conscious,
which is exactly what she does.

61
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,873
She offers him something that makes him 
self conscious and she becomes self 

62
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,710
consciousness conscious.
Also.

63
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:09,490
As a consequence in women make men self 
conscious.

64
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,430
You can't think of a truth that's truer 
than that,

65
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,720
and the reason they do it is because 
they're very selective and most men they

66
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:17,554
reject.
So God comes up and he's looking for 

67
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:21,514
Adam because he's used to wandering 
around with them and Adam's hiding 

68
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,060
behind a bush which says something about
Adam's level of intelligence first.

69
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:29,950
Because you know God can see through 
bushes,

70
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,190
but it also says something about his 
level of self consciousness.

71
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,330
Because what it means is that when Adam 
become self conscious,

72
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,793
he no longer believes that the fact that
he was made in the image of God is 

73
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:44,770
sufficient to give him stature.

74
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,360
And so God says,
well,

75
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:48,610
who told you you were naked?
And this is where.

76
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,840
This is really Adam's fall,
I think he says it was the woman.

77
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,110
He blames her,
which is really pathological.

78
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,660
The woman you gave me,
it was her fault.

79
00:04:58,661 --> 00:05:00,190
Yeah,
she made you self conscious.

80
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:00,850
Well,
Hooray.

81
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,720
You know,
you woke up.

82
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,150
There's something to be said for that.
Now.

83
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:04,984
Women torture man into being awake,
and I don't suppose that's always 

84
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:10,600
received with gratitude.
John Milton,

85
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,434
he wrote paradise lost for two reasons.
One was to justify the ways of God to 

86
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:20,080
man,
and the second rationale for his writing

87
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:20,914
was to codify mythologies stories that 
were in some ways peripheral to 

88
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:30,160
canonical Christianity into a single 
coherent narrative.

89
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,500
Here's a question he tried to answer,
which was,

90
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,250
well,
if God was a all knowing,

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,730
why would he sat Adam and eve up to 
fall?

92
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,790
And Milton has a very sophisticated 
answer to that,

93
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,910
and it is that people truly have 
freewill,

94
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,300
and even if God knew that they were 
going to fall,

95
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,390
there was nothing he could do to stop 
that except deny them freewill.

96
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,690
And Freewill is valuable that that 
denial was not going to happen.

97
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,623
Dostoevsky points out that freedom 
happens to be very important to people 

98
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,124
and even arbitrary freedom,
like people want the freedom to go to 

99
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:13,100
hell in a handbasket even they don't 
want constraints.

100
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:15,470
They're willing to put up with a lot to 
have their freedom.

101
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:20,180
And God's judgment is something like 
freedom is better than safety.

102
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,090
The snake in the garden of Eden is a 
really interesting character.

103
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,213
Human beings and their closest 
biological relative chimpanzees are 

104
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:33,710
innately afraid of and attracted to 
reptiles.

105
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,573
They automatically trigger off responses
in a part of the brain called the 

106
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:39,440
Amygdala that's associated with anxiety.

107
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,603
And I think the evolutionary reason for 
this is that mammals and reptiles have 

108
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:49,721
been at war in a sense over ecological 
turf for something between $60,000,200,

109
00:06:51,601 --> 00:06:56,060
million years reptilian features which 
are cold blooded,

110
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,070
uh,
a piercing I'd tooth lurking,

111
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,670
nocturnal out there,
out in the unknown.

112
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,013
Outward chaos is the snake is 
representative of the unknown in a 

113
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:10,724
sense,
and it's an ambivalent feature and you 

114
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:13,244
see that,
you see that even in its used in 

115
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:17,000
mythology because for example,
the dragon in,

116
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,913
in,
in western culture is a negative 

117
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:19,934
feature,
but in Chinese culture it's positive 

118
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:24,260
feature.
And so the unknown is like that.

119
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:25,094
It's positive and negative.
The snake in the garden of Eden is 

120
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:32,180
representative of all those things that 
lurk when you think you know what you're

121
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:34,880
doing and when you think you know what 
you're doing,

122
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:35,714
you've carved out this little Eden has 
little paradise in which you're 

123
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:38,744
operating,
but there's always something that's 

124
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:42,800
lurking and that's all the things you're
not paying attention to.

125
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,993
Well,
that's the snake and we're not snake 

126
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:46,730
pops up.
People are,

127
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,130
we're wired.
If a little snake pops out,

128
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,250
we might want to run away from it,
but we're curious about that.

129
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:54,050
We're going to go over there and 
investigate right away.

130
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,273
Now,
when chimps come across a python in the 

131
00:07:57,501 --> 00:07:59,720
forest,
they have a specific cry.

132
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,710
It's called a snake wrath,
and the chimps who don't like snakes,

133
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,693
they don't run from it.
They back off and then they watch the 

134
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:10,190
thing.
They cannot tear their eyes away from it

135
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,650
and some of them will stand there and 
look at it for 10 minutes.

136
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,950
Other individuals will stand there for 
hours watching the snake.

137
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,800
The unknown is fascinating.
We can't look away from it.

138
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,200
We have to encounter it even if it's 
terrifying.

139
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,170
It's partly why,
you know teenagers like horror movies,

140
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,530
they're driven to look at the snake.

141
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,660
They're driven to interact with the 
snake.

142
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,370
In Genesis,
of course,

143
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,680
interacting with the snake means the end
of paradise just like it does in life.

144
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,693
There are ideas that the serpent in the 
garden of Eden was Satan and trying to 

145
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,223
destroy God's handiwork.
People often look back in their lives 

146
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:45,980
and they say,
well,

147
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:46,814
you know,
I got knocked out of my little paradise 

148
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:48,800
by a,
you know,

149
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:49,634
this particular event,
but looking back on it really made me 

150
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,420
grow up.
It really made me mature.

151
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,160
Whatever it is,
that's the serpent in the garden of Eden

152
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,560
certainly plays that role.
It's a catalyst.

153
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,513
Much of what's unknown is redemptive.
Much of what's unknown gives life saver 

154
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,253
it.
It provides the kind of excitement that 

155
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:06,834
justifies suffering.
The injunction behind religious thought 

156
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:10,404
fundamentally is that you should live 
your life in such a way that the 

157
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:15,144
suffering it has to contain because 
you're confined and vulnerable is 

158
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:18,714
justified.

159
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,303
A Profane World exists because paradise 
always falls apart now and that's a 

160
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:27,804
catastrophe.
That's the human catastrophe and maybe 

161
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:30,084
that's original scent and profane life 
is characterized by suffering intense 

162
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:36,690
suffering,
and that's a terrible thing.

163
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,853
I mean,
it's so terrible that the first two 

164
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:42,000
people to really inhabit the profane 
world,

165
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,863
who cain and Abel.
Cain is so disturbed by the nature of 

166
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:50,190
the world that he turns into a 
revengeful,

167
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,130
homicidal,
resentful,

168
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,260
fascist,
authoritarian,

169
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,570
and the father of war.
Well,

170
00:09:57,571 --> 00:10:01,080
that's how bad,
that's how bad profane existence can be,

171
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,420
but if you keep going in the same 
direction,

172
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,343
you can get so conscious that the 
profane conditions of of being are no 

173
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:12,540
longer tragic,
they're acceptable,

174
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,460
but you have to live well enough so that
the suffering is worth it.

175
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,220
If you took advantage of every 
opportunity you had,

176
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,530
if you crawl through every window that 
was open to you,

177
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,663
if you lived as perfectly as you could,
your life would be justifiable on its 

178
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:32,920
own terms despite its suffering and 
despite the tragedy in the world.

179
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,813
That's why character guard said that 
people are redeemed one by one and not 

180
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,870
in groups.
You know,

181
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,460
it's an individual project.

182
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,300
I would say human beings are built to 
take tragedy,

183
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,403
but they're not built to take evil.
The most unsettling thing isn't that a 

184
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:48,814
close relative dies of cancer.
Unsettling as that is the most 

185
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:56,050
unsettling thing is to be treated 
casually in a brutal manner for no other

186
00:10:56,051 --> 00:10:58,000
reason.
Then the brutality itself,

187
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,013
that's what undermines your sense of 
your belief in human existence and in 

188
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:02,224
the value of human existence.
That's what demoralizes and kills many 

189
00:11:05,771 --> 00:11:08,020
social scientists in particular.
I would say.

190
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,000
I feel that the idea of evil is an 
anachronistic.

191
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,043
The reason that evil is obliterated out 
of consciousness is because we don't 

192
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,540
have a theory to account for it.
Lana,

193
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,020
we don't have a framework within which 
it fits on.

194
00:11:23,021 --> 00:11:25,870
Religious ideation certainly provides 
that kind of framework.

195
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,350
I also think that we dismiss evil 
because it's such a terrifying phenomena

196
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,690
and whenever it crops up its head,
everybody runs around saying,

197
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:35,860
well,
who could have predicted this?

198
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,600
Who could have predicted this,
but you know,

199
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:39,580
all you have to do is look and you can 
predict it,

200
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:44,170
and the people who perpetrated often say
exactly what they're doing and why.

201
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,300
So the columbine kids,
for example,

202
00:11:46,301 --> 00:11:49,690
they said something very much like,
well,

203
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:53,770
we've taken a close look at existence 
and it isn't worthy.

204
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,460
It's not worthy because people are 
limited invulnerable and there's way too

205
00:11:57,461 --> 00:12:02,461
much suffering and suffering.
Vulnerable things are kind of despicable

206
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,680
and it would be better if they were just
all wiped out.

207
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,260
Plus I'm the guy to do it,
and that's exactly.

208
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,540
Fundamentally,
that's exactly what they claimed.

209
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,321
You might say,
well,

210
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:13,120
why would someone come to that 
conclusion?

211
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,750
It's like,
that's not a good answer.

212
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,003
Everyone comes to that conclusion from 
from time to time when they're 

213
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,213
disappointed or frustrated or when you 
know their dreams of falling apart or 

214
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:24,694
when someone near them suffers or they 
doubt the utility not only of their own 

215
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:31,810
existence but of existence itself,
if it's taken far enough,

216
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,940
taken far enough,
that attitude in genders,

217
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,380
atrocity,
it's evil,

218
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:41,320
and I think you can define it no problem
because people say,

219
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:42,430
well,
you can define evil.

220
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,353
It's wrong.
Evil is the production of suffering for 

221
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,374
its own sake.
That's simple and if you think people 

222
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:54,040
don't do that regularly,
well you know you're just.

223
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,360
You just haven't been looking.
