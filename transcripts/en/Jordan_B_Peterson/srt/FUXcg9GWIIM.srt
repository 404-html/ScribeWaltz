1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:04,120
This is Jocko podcast number one 55 with
me,

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:09,690
Jocko willink
on the island.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,640
The dead were piling up.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,120
Yeah.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,953
In the mission report,
the head of the convoy wrote at 2:00 PM 

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,050
on May 20th I went to the island of Xeno
with commander taps golf.

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,023
There was a terrible scramble.
People crowding and fighting around the 

8
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:38,170
bags of flour,
dead bodies everywhere.

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,573
A hundred or more and lots of people 
crawling about and crying give us bread 

10
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,083
boss.
It's been two days since we've been 

11
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:48,394
given anything to eat.
They're trying to make us die of hunger 

12
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,103
and the cold.
They told us that people had begun 

13
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,370
eating the dead bodies,
that they were cooking human flesh.

14
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,490
The scene on the island was dreadful.
Appalling.

15
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,463
On May 21st alone,
the three health officer's counted 70 

16
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:25,551
additional dead bodies in five cases.
They emphasized the liver,

17
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,200
the heart,
the lungs and fleshy part of bodies.

18
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,360
Yeah.

19
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,380
Had been caught off.

20
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:35,763
Yeah.

21
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,340
On one of the bodies,
the head had been torn off along the,

22
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,960
along with the male genital organs and 
part of the skin.

23
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,680
These mutilations constitutes strong 
evidence of cannibalistic acts.

24
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,663
In addition,
they suggest the existence of serious 

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,420
psychopathology.
He's on the same day.

26
00:01:58,421 --> 00:01:59,254
May 21st the deportees themselves 
brought us three individuals who had 

27
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:09,031
been caught with blood on their hands 
and holding human livers.

28
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,213
Our examination of these three 
individuals did not reveal any extreme 

29
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,300
NACAC one
and there's an elderly,

30
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,890
local peasant woman who reported the 
things we saw.

31
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,940
People were dying everywhere.
They were killing each other.

32
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:44,110
There was a guard name Kostia the Nico 
off a young fellow.

33
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,880
He was courting a pretty girl who had 
been sent there.

34
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,050
He protected her.

35
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,710
Yeah.

36
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:54,710
One day he had to be away for a while
and he told one of his comrades,

37
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,980
take care of her,
but with all the people,

38
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,190
the comrade couldn't do much.

39
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,250
People caught the girl,
tied her to a tree,

40
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,770
cut off her breasts,
her muscles,

41
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,950
everything they could eat.
They were hungry.

42
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,030
They had to eat.
When costs are you came back,

43
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,880
she was still alive.
He tried to save her,

44
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,650
but she had lost too much blood.
She died.

45
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,730
That was the kind of thing that happened
when you went along the island.

46
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:42,250
You saw flesh wrapped in rags.

47
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,320
Okay.

48
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,330
Human flesh that had been cut.

49
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,170
Yeah.

50
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,340
And hung in the trees.

51
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,253
Okay.

52
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,143
And that right there is from a book 
called Cannibal Island by Nicholas 

53
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:05,551
worth,
who's written books about communism.

54
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:07,894
I think his most famous as the black 
book of communism and Cannibal Island 

55
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:13,444
specifically breaks down one of the 
small individual nightmares of the 

56
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:19,864
Soviet gulags.
But the nightmare was not small and it 

57
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:31,750
certainly was not specific.
It was widespread and it was broad

58
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,260
and it was almost incomprehensible.

59
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,593
Yeah.

60
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,210
And very little about it would be known 
or not for one man,

61
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,113
Alexander Solzhenitsyn,
who not only survive the gulags but 

62
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,733
lived on to write incredibly detailed 
and very well researched to books about 

63
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,050
the gulags.
Some of them were fictionalized

64
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,710
like a day in the life of Ivan 
Denisovich and for the,

65
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,663
for the good of the cause,
but most comprehensively in his three 

66
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,640
volume tome,
the Gulag archipelago

67
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,273
and this series is,
is a massive series and it's been cut 

68
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:25,881
down to an abridged version that was 
actually approved by the author himself.

69
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,560
And the abridged version has just been 
rereleased in Europe with a forward by a

70
00:05:31,561 --> 00:05:32,394
man that I think repopulate [inaudible] 
that book a man that is here today to 

71
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:40,410
discuss that book.
And among other things,

72
00:05:40,411 --> 00:05:45,411
I'm sure a man that I needed to give an 
introduction to the first time he was on

73
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:46,494
this podcast,
but now who needs no introduction 

74
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,650
whatsoever,
a man by the name of Dr. Jordan B.

75
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,520
Peterson.
Jordan,

76
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,510
thank you for coming back on.

77
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,050
How's it rough beginning Jocko.
Jesus.

78
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,650
Uh,
yeah,

79
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,340
I remember when I started listening to 
you,

80
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,180
you would say something along the lines 
of that,

81
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,163
you know,
we are quite capable of creating hell 

82
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,700
for ourselves as human beings and that 
clearly that situation.

83
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:26,110
I don't know.
I mean that's,

84
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:27,500
that's,
that's hell yeah.

85
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,580
And close enough.
Yeah.

86
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,630
And it's,
it's,

87
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,780
it's created by us.
It's created by us,

88
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:36,740
which I think is,
um,

89
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,970
obviously horrific and the Gulag 
archipelago,

90
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:41,900
um,
you know,

91
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,820
you,
you talked about that book a lot and,

92
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,840
and one of the things that on that book 
hits you hard obviously for me,

93
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:50,570
uh,
uh,

94
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,750
there's a book called about face by 
Colonel David Hackworth.

95
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,430
I'm from a different world,
I guess the you in many ways.

96
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,490
The book that hit me hardest in my life 
was,

97
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,353
was that book about face and it's,
it's one of those things that when I 

98
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:09,210
read it,
I started putting it together.

99
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:14,211
It's like things started to fit and
I remember that and I was wondering,

100
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:17,384
I guess from my perspective,
at what point did you read the Gulag 

101
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:25,670
archipelago and at what point did you 
start to say,

102
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,390
okay,
there's something really,

103
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,750
really important here for me to try and 
understand?

104
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,450
Well,
I read it back in the 1980s,

105
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,703
early,
I would say I'd read some Solzhenitsyn 

106
00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:44,040
before that.
I read the late Dave Dave,

107
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,210
a day in the life of Ivan Denisovich 
when I was about 13 or 14.

108
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,100
And then I read the Gulag archipelago in
my early twenties.

109
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,660
When I was reading a lot of 
psychological material too,

110
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:02,350
when I started reading young and Freud 
and the great clinicians and uh,

111
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,573
or is reading a fair bit about what had 
happened in Nazi Germany at the same 

112
00:08:05,671 --> 00:08:06,504
time.
And also Viktor Frankl's man's search 

113
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:09,624
for meaning and Solzhenitsyn's book is 
in some ways like an elaborated 

114
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:14,934
extension of Frankel Frankel of course 
described what happened to him in the 

115
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:18,504
Nazi concentration camps.
And it's a relatively short book and 

116
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:23,490
it's a great book.
But soldier Nixon's book is,

117
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,250
it's,
it's much broader and,

118
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,443
and I would say deeper.
And the thing that affected me most 

119
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:35,790
particularly was the psychological take 
on the,

120
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,100
on the totalitarian states.

121
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,580
You know,
I had been studying political science up

122
00:08:41,581 --> 00:08:42,414
to that point and the political science 
scientists and the economists who I 

123
00:08:48,421 --> 00:08:53,040
would say we're under the sway of 
Marxists thinking,

124
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,770
although not nearly to the degree that 
are now,

125
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,200
we're convinced that the reason that 
people engaged in conflict was basically

126
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,710
a consequence of argumentation over 
resources.

127
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,663
You know,
it was basically an economic argument 

128
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,390
and I never bought that.
It never made sense to me.

129
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,493
I mean,
obviously there are circumstances where 

130
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,384
that's true,
but it didn't seem to be fundamentally 

131
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:14,724
the case.
Like tribal warfare isn't precisely 

132
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:19,890
about resources.
It's maybe it's about territory or maybe

133
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:20,724
it's about identity.
But it never seemed to me to be simply 

134
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,680
about resources.
Um,

135
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,640
partly because,
well a resource is something that people

136
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:30,474
value,
but it isn't obvious why people value 

137
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:33,684
what they value.
And so it doesn't solve the fundamental 

138
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:35,880
problem.

139
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,713
Anyways.
When I was reading Frankel and 

140
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:38,814
Solzhenitsyn,
I started to more deeply understand the 

141
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:46,140
relationship between the individual and 
the atrocity.

142
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,663
And that's what I found most interesting
was that Frankel's claim and 

143
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:52,614
Solzhenitsyn's claim as well,
that it was the moral corruption of the 

144
00:09:56,461 --> 00:10:01,461
citizenry that allowed the totalitarian 
catastrophes to occur.

145
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,803
And that that in some sense was the 
responsibility of every individual in 

146
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:11,460
the system who looked the other way or 
who participated actively.

147
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,400
I mean,
even in the gulag camps themselves,

148
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,070
they were almost all run by the 
prisoners.

149
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,143
There wasn't enough administrative 
manpower to run the prison system 

150
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:23,490
without the cooperation,
so to speak,

151
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:25,920
of the prisoners.
So it is,

152
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,783
it is a surreal sort of hell.
Were you in prison yourself and 

153
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,860
Solzhenitsyn's fundamental claim,
and this was true for Franklin as well,

154
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:39,750
and also for Vaclav Havel who eventually
became president of Czechoslovakia,

155
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,150
or at least of the Czech Republic,
I don't remember which,

156
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,813
you know,
they believe that it was the individual 

157
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:46,854
proclivity to accept lies that fostered 
the ability of tyrants to destroy the 

158
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:53,844
state.

159
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,090
And then
well,

160
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:57,924
and that also led to complicitness with 
regards to all the absolute atrocities 

161
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:03,960
that were occurring in both the Nazi 
state,

162
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:07,980
in the and in the Soviet state.
And I think that's true when I read,

163
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,293
like I read soldier Knutson's books in 
that a lot of the books I read about 

164
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,200
Nazi Germany to not as a victim and not 
as a hero,

165
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:18,090
but as a perpetrator,
you know,

166
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:18,924
which I think it's really important.
It's something that's really important 

167
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:25,950
to do when you read history is that it's
easy to cast yourself as a victim.

168
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,563
It's easy to cast yourself as the person
who would have been heroic in the 

169
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:30,684
circumstance,
but it's also unbelievably useful to 

170
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:33,894
understand that there's a good chance.
Had you been in those situations that 

171
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:41,280
you wouldn't have been on the side of 
the good guys and,

172
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:42,330
no,
and that's a terrible,

173
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:45,780
it's really a terrible realization,
but it's,

174
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,460
it's necessary realization.
Again,

175
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:53,590
just going back to this idea of what you
out of reading,

176
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:54,070
because people

177
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,903
ask me now because I read books all the 
time on my podcast and what you just 

178
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:01,660
said,
it struck me as something that's,

179
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,113
people have told me,
I read that book before but I didn't 

180
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:07,594
really get out of it.
What you got out of it and when I heard 

181
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:12,850
you read it I,
I was saying,

182
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:15,190
wow,
how did I need to go reread this book?

183
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,623
And I think one of the key things is you
looked at these books as you were not 

184
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:21,190
the victim,
but the perpetrator.

185
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:24,700
One thing that when I read books,
I know I read a lot of books,

186
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:29,701
mostly about war for me,
I always think about the,

187
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,220
the people,
I don't know.

188
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,113
We see myself as the person that goes 
and heroically storms the beaches and 

189
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,210
survives every,
you know,

190
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:41,044
in a war book.
There's these people that get mentioned 

191
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,441
for it,
for it,

192
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:44,900
for a half a paragraph,
for,

193
00:12:44,901 --> 00:12:45,970
for two sentences.

194
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,630
And that sometimes they don't even have 
a name because you know,

195
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:51,610
you're the battalion commander is 
storming the beach of Normandy.

196
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:52,444
You don't,
you're not going to name every single 

197
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:55,360
person.
But for some reason,

198
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,170
and maybe it's just my experiences of,
of being in combat,

199
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,010
when I read about that two sentences of 
that guy,

200
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,860
that that gets shot,
that gets killed,

201
00:13:05,861 --> 00:13:06,694
that gets blown up.
I completely understand and relate to 

202
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:11,914
that person.
Like I,

203
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,783
I don't just see it as me being the guy 
that is always winning and always doing 

204
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:17,854
okay and always surviving.
I feel and relate to those guys that 

205
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:23,741
didn't.
And,

206
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:27,730
and part of that is just because of my 
friends that I lost in combat.

207
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,330
Like those guys,
they're their people.

208
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,990
And I think that key thing of,
of reading it and going,

209
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,610
man,
every single person,

210
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,473
like when you read about these groups,
you're talking about millions of people 

211
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,830
that were tortured,
died,

212
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,693
murdered.

213
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,570
Every one of those people.
Keyword is people.

214
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:51,571
Every one of those people is a person.
And to your point,

215
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,003
every single one of those executioners,
every single one of those murderers is 

216
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:00,340
also a purse.
You know,

217
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,070
there's a great book called ordinary 
men.

218
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:03,761
Oh yeah,
we,

219
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:05,850
we reviewed that on this podcast.
Right,

220
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,701
right.
And so,

221
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:07,211
you know,
it's,

222
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:08,044
it's,
it's one of the greatest books written 

223
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:11,770
about what happened in the Second World 
War,

224
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:12,604
I think on the end of,
on the atrocity and [inaudible] because 

225
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,260
the author does such a lovely job of,
well,

226
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:22,720
it's a strange way of putting it in this
context,

227
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:23,554
but you know,
it's about this police battalion that 

228
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:28,100
was moved into Poland after the Germans 
went through and,

229
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:32,470
and occupied the country and they were 
there to establish order like police do,

230
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,500
but also to participate in the mopping 
up,

231
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:36,790
let's say.
Uh,

232
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,160
that was part and parcel of the war.
And you know,

233
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:41,610
these were ordinary policemen.
Um,

234
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,763
middleclass guys,
most of whom had been educated and 

235
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:49,780
socialized before the Nazi propaganda 
machine really got rolling.

236
00:14:49,781 --> 00:14:52,280
So they weren't like Hitler youth types.
Um,

237
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,660
they were ordinary men and they were 
brought and they had a commander who had

238
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:01,004
made an explicit case that if they 
weren't able to tolerate the conditions 

239
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:07,334
in Poland that they could go home.
So there was no top down order that you 

240
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:14,750
had to do this or else.
And then they were,

241
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:15,973
you know,
first of all they started rounding up 

242
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,990
while mostly Jewish people,
men between 18 and 65 and then,

243
00:15:20,991 --> 00:15:21,824
you know,
they started to participate in the 

244
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:23,444
entire atrocious mess and they were,
they ended up many of them taking naked 

245
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:30,510
pregnant women out into fields and 
shooting them in the back of the head.

246
00:15:30,511 --> 00:15:35,511
And what the author does is outline how 
that happens to you,

247
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,000
you know,
one step at a time.

248
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:43,010
And so it's a really horrifying book and
it's a brilliant book because there's no

249
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:48,011
attempt to make the perpetrators like 
some creatures that aren't human,

250
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,420
like just pure psychopath.

251
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,280
And of course in in,
in an situation like Nazi Germany and,

252
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,230
and in the horrors of the communist 
states,

253
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,290
there was no shortage of places for 
psychopaths to prevail.

254
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,450
But that's not really the issue.
The issue is,

255
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,913
well,
how does an ordinary person come to 

256
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:09,710
participate in a global horror,
let's say?

257
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,260
And what does that mean about being an 
ordinary person?

258
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,850
And then the next question is,
well,

259
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:17,030
what does it mean about how you should 
conduct your life?

260
00:16:17,031 --> 00:16:19,280
And one of the things that,
I mean,

261
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:20,114
I think what happened to me when I read 
all this material in the 80s was that I 

262
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:26,324
became convinced that there wasn't 
anything more important to do in the 

263
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:35,381
aftermath of what had happened in the 
20th century than to try to build people

264
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:39,800
who were responsible enough as truth 
telling courageous,

265
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:44,801
responsible citizens so that the 
probability would increase,

266
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:48,020
that if they were in a position to make 
a terrible choice,

267
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:49,610
that they would make the right one.

268
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,760
And I would say this lecture tour that 
I'm doing,

269
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,660
which has now extended over more than a 
hundred cities,

270
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,360
is an extension of the same thing.
Well,

271
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:01,790
I think it's the same thing that you're 
trying to do with your book.

272
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:04,580
Like we were just looking at your Mickey
and the dragons book,

273
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:07,130
right?
And you're trying to lay out,

274
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,860
um,
uh,

275
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,840
uh,
psychological pathway that guides people

276
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:15,560
towards responsibility and courage and 
truth and all of that.

277
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:18,980
And that is the bulwark against tyranny.
And it's actually the,

278
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:22,560
it's actually at the individual level.
And we kind of know that we,

279
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,723
we know that in the West.
I think that's part of the core ethos 

280
00:17:25,731 --> 00:17:26,564
of,
well certainly that of the English 

281
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:29,444
common law system certainly of,
of the American way of looking at the 

282
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:36,440
world is that each citizen is the 
bulwark against tyranny.

283
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,260
And that's actually true.
It's,

284
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,450
and,
and that's a terrible thing to,

285
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:46,451
to think through because it means that 
you are responsible for the integrity or

286
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:49,280
lack thereof of your state.

287
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,700
And it's,
it's on you,

288
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:51,831
you know,
and,

289
00:17:51,831 --> 00:17:52,664
and there's something great about that 
because it means that your existence 

290
00:17:55,771 --> 00:18:00,771
actually matters to you and to your 
family and to the broader community in a

291
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:01,884
really major way,
in a way that's much more significant 

292
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:07,500
than you might think.
And that the,

293
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,663
your proclivity to abdicate your moral 
responsibility echoes way farther than 

294
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,250
you might consider,
especially under some circumstances,

295
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,440
you know,
and soldier Nitsa.

296
00:18:18,441 --> 00:18:19,274
And one of the things that's so amazing 
about the Gulag archipelago is his 

297
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:22,704
stories not only of the absolute bloody 
catastrophe of the Soviet state and his 

298
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:33,830
incredibly astute documentation of the 
role that the utopian,

299
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,533
political and philosophical assumptions 
of Marxism played in creating the 

300
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:40,741
system,
right?

301
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:42,870
It wasn't an aberration,
it was a direct,

302
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,960
logical consequence of that collectivist
viewpoint.

303
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,213
And to document all that,
but also to tell endless stories about 

304
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:53,310
people who were able,
at least to some degree,

305
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,413
to not become corrupted,
even under unbelievably horrific 

306
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:00,390
conditions,
you know?

307
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,980
And,
and that's something you also get out of

308
00:19:01,981 --> 00:19:04,050
Viktor Frankl's book man's search for 
meaning,

309
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,490
you know,
and um,

310
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,833
and so the,
the Gulag archipelago is a story about 

311
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:11,034
horror in some sense,
but it's more a story of the triumph of 

312
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,090
the fundamental triumph of the human 
spirit and perhaps no more,

313
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:19,963
uh,
perhaps most evident in the case of 

314
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:26,310
soldier.
And it's an himself because he memorized

315
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:27,144
this book in some sense while he was in 
the camps and then wrote it under 

316
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:33,450
extreme duress afterwards.
And it's an immense undertaking and it's

317
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,420
unbelievably emotionally intense.
The entire book.

318
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:37,830
It's like one,
you know,

319
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:38,664
1700 page scream of outrage.
He just can hardly believe that someone 

320
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:47,490
can write at that white hot intensity 
for such a long period of time.

321
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:48,324
And you know,
his book had an unbelievable global 

322
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:52,734
impact.
I think it's sold 30 million copies and 

323
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:58,620
it definitely,
for at least a reasonable period of time

324
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,070
made it completely untenable for,
um,

325
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,203
utopian resentful,
Utopian intellectuals to ethically 

326
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:10,170
justified their radical leftist 
collectivism.

327
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,293
It,
it just blew the slats out from 

328
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:16,440
underneath any ethical credibility that 
communism,

329
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:17,723
that,
that remained of the communist doctrine 

330
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,184
by the 1970s and that that's a hell of a
thing for someone to manage on their 

331
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:24,144
own.

332
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,890
Pretty big task.
Uh,

333
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,470
so while you were going through that,
I was thinking myself,

334
00:20:30,471 --> 00:20:35,270
so as I was talking to,
I still talk to military folks and I was

335
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:38,540
talking to some military leaders,
young leaders,

336
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,960
so like platoon level and company level 
leaders.

337
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,940
So these are guys that are in charge of 
you know,

338
00:20:43,941 --> 00:20:48,050
40 guys or maybe 150 guys
and,

339
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,760
and you know,
you can have some real ethical problems.

340
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:52,594
And,
and one of the things that I said to 

341
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:57,790
this group was I said,
hey,

342
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:02,820
in your s in your platoon,
you've got a murderer in your platoon,

343
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,360
you've got someone in your platoon that 
is a sadist.

344
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,600
And the,
they were kind of looking at me,

345
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,210
um,
suspect,

346
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,470
you know,
a little bit like,

347
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,480
oh come on now,
come on.

348
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,690
What are you talking about?
How big is the platoon?

349
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,150
A platoon is 40 guys and stuff like 
that.

350
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,213
And I was,
I was actually going to ask you how 

351
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:25,594
accurate I was and then I was going to 
actually say that no matter what you 

352
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:30,210
say,
how accurate is even if it was,

353
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,870
even if it was one out of every 
thousand,

354
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,793
you have to act as a leader,
as if in your platoon you've got one of 

355
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:38,230
those guys are two of those guys.
That's a way you need to look.

356
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,160
And there's another book called the Rape
of Nan King.

357
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,203
We've covered that.
So one of the things that was really 

358
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:49,630
horrifying about that book is,
so imagine that there's maybe,

359
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:50,464
let's say that there's one in a hundred 
just for the sake of argument that's 

360
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:55,700
really got cruel and psychopathic 
traits.

361
00:21:55,701 --> 00:21:57,160
What,
what do you think professionally?

362
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,173
What do you think that number is?
I think 1% isn't unreasonable and it 

363
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:02,390
could be higher than that.
I mean,

364
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,770
there's gradations,
right?

365
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,783
Yeah.
There's probably in a group of 40 

366
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,124
people,
there's going to be one guy in there 

367
00:22:07,181 --> 00:22:08,014
who's proclivity in that direction is 
sufficiently strong so that you better 

368
00:22:12,221 --> 00:22:13,990
keep an eye on him,
that's for sure.

369
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,840
And this is a group of people that 
joined the military,

370
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,860
right?
So they're already,

371
00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:18,880
you know,
you've already gotten,

372
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,620
you've already got a group that's okay 
with,

373
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,260
with theoretically having to kill other 
people.

374
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,190
So this is probably,
you know,

375
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:28,240
so if it's 100 islands,
that's likely an underestimate.

376
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:32,350
So I think your estimate is perfectly 
reasonable and it might be conservative.

377
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,713
What happened in Nan king was that the 
most sadistic people became the targets 

378
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:42,190
of imitation and emulation.
And that's when things really get out of

379
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:42,940
hand.
Yeah.

380
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,750
Right.
So,

381
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,140
and that's the same thing to me,
Lai massacre and,

382
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:46,880
and that was it.
So,

383
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,510
so when I was talking to this group and 
I'm getting it,

384
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:51,010
I said to him,
I said,

385
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,720
you're looking at me like right now.

386
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,411
Like,
I'm like,

387
00:22:53,411 --> 00:22:54,850
I don't know what I'm talking about.
It like I'm crazy.

388
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,480
Who knows about the mee Lai massacre 
and,

389
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,363
and you know,
all of a sudden it got quiet because if 

390
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:01,810
you know anything about the mee Lai 
massacre,

391
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,850
it was a normal group of guys.
It was a normal group of guys.

392
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,710
It was a normal company of American 
soldiers.

393
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:09,544
And you know what,
they'd been through some stress they'd 

394
00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:11,910
been through,
you know,

395
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:12,743
they'd,
they'd had their friends killed and it 

396
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:15,700
was in Vietnam.
There was no one really to react against

397
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:16,151
or to,
to,

398
00:23:16,151 --> 00:23:18,310
to take your aggression out on because 
the enemy,

399
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,080
you couldn't see them.
They would hide.

400
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:23,470
And it was,
but then they turned and they snapped.

401
00:23:23,471 --> 00:23:25,830
And the same thing you had the leader,
um,

402
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:30,220
a guy named lieutenant calley who was 
the platoon leader who eat,

403
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,123
Yo,
I'd love for you to do a psychological 

404
00:23:31,961 --> 00:23:32,794
profile media who used one of these guys
that was kind of like it was it totally 

405
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,730
insecure about everything.

406
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:40,180
And so he got those shoulder boards on,
which is the way,

407
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,590
which is the way Solzhenitsyn,
he describes his,

408
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,070
his experience as being a platoon leader
and what it did to him.

409
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:48,770
And he goes through that.
This book is fantastic to hear.

410
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,730
When he talks about what he did,
he knew he was looking back saying,

411
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,593
oh,
I did this and I didn't listen to this 

412
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:58,280
little rampage of things that he,
how he acted as a commander.

413
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,623
I ate the food,
the good food right in front of my guys 

414
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:01,994
when they weren't getting for,
I was getting the good food and he did 

415
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,633
took advantage of all the little,
all the little comforts that you got 

416
00:24:07,011 --> 00:24:08,740
being an officer and you know what?
Yeah,

417
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,780
well he was trying and in the whole 
book,

418
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,170
and especially in that section,
which I think is in volume two,

419
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,780
which I think is the greatest of the 
three volumes,

420
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,870
especially the last half of it,
which is just absolutely,

421
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,830
it's,
it's genius level writing,

422
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,280
unbelievably compelling and brilliant 
and yeah,

423
00:24:27,281 --> 00:24:28,114
I mean he,
he said that when he was in the camps 

424
00:24:29,831 --> 00:24:30,664
that one of the things that he did,
especially once he started to identify 

425
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:34,834
people that he truly admired,
was to go over his life with a fine 

426
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:39,334
tooth comb and try to try to remember 
everything that he did wrong by his own 

427
00:24:45,011 --> 00:24:45,844
estimation,
and then try to set it right in some 

428
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,180
manner.
And so there was a,

429
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,370
that's a repentance and then a 
redemption,

430
00:24:51,371 --> 00:24:51,781
right?
There's,

431
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,770
there's a real,
there's a real fundamental,

432
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,740
like a medieval Christian undertone to 
all of that.

433
00:24:56,741 --> 00:24:57,574
But it was one of the things that's 
quite interesting is that when you talk 

434
00:25:00,731 --> 00:25:01,564
about issues that are this serious,
you're almost inevitably in a situation 

435
00:25:06,731 --> 00:25:07,564
where you're going to find yourself 
compelled to use some kind of quasi 

436
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:13,590
religious language because you end up 
discussing good and evil and,

437
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,523
and issues of redemption in issues of 
repentance and issues of conscience and 

438
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,150
sin and all of that.

439
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,740
There isn't language that's deep enough 
to get at it otherwise.

440
00:25:21,741 --> 00:25:22,574
And what Solzhenitsyn did was scour his 
conscience and try to put himself 

441
00:25:27,431 --> 00:25:32,200
together partly because he was shamed.
He was ashamed of himself in the face of

442
00:25:32,201 --> 00:25:36,340
these extraordinarily extraordinary 
people who seem to be able to keep their

443
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:37,174
moral compass under circumstances where 
no one should ever assume that they 

444
00:25:41,441 --> 00:25:44,200
would keep their moral compass.
Because certainly,

445
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,060
like I said,
when I was reading this,

446
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,313
the Gulag and other books like that,
I never assumed that if I was in those 

447
00:25:50,741 --> 00:25:54,220
situations that I would have been one of
the people who kept their head.

448
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:59,221
And we're able to withstand the 
temptation to become a trustee,

449
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:00,424
for example,
and to take things the easy way and to 

450
00:26:01,871 --> 00:26:06,550
Lord it over the other prisoners and to,
and to adopt that position of authority.

451
00:26:06,551 --> 00:26:07,270
You know,
it's like,

452
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,660
it's like a head slave among slaves,
but you know,

453
00:26:10,661 --> 00:26:12,820
you could say,
well better to be the head slave than to

454
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,840
be the bottom slave.

455
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,320
And while that's true in some sense with
regards to creature comfort,

456
00:26:17,321 --> 00:26:19,600
but as Solzhenitsyn point out points 
out,

457
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:21,520
it might be a little bit hard on your 
soul.

458
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,670
And that actually turns out to be 
something of,

459
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:26,500
of crucial,
not only crucial,

460
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,334
important psychologically,
but crucial importance sociologically 

461
00:26:30,161 --> 00:26:32,860
and politically.
Because if you sacrifice that,

462
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:33,723
then you work the structure around you,
which is exactly what happened in the 

463
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,760
establishment of these camps,
you know?

464
00:26:38,761 --> 00:26:39,594
And the,
the,

465
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,220
the Soviet Union was just one big lie.
What was their old joke?

466
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,250
They pretend to pay us and we pretend to
work.

467
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,593
It's like

468
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,340
the,
the whole,

469
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,460
the whole book and the whole Soviet 
Union.

470
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:55,080
When you,
when you read about it now,

471
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,520
it seems like it's,
it seems like a bad joke.

472
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,110
It seems like a bad movie you could with
just the way,

473
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,490
the way that Stalin would do something 
and,

474
00:27:04,491 --> 00:27:05,930
and the way that that order would come 
down.

475
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,130
It seems like one of those cheesy,
um,

476
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,023
you know,
comedic movies about these decisions 

477
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:14,760
that they're making and it's surreal.
It's completely,

478
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,440
it's completely insane.
You know,

479
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:19,070
at one point he's talking about the,
there was a,

480
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:22,800
a new penalty for when they call it sh 
clipping corn or,

481
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,693
or they're basically a 12 year old kid 
would be starving and you'd go into a 

482
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:29,660
field of wheat and clip a cure.
A,

483
00:27:29,661 --> 00:27:31,380
a core,
an ear of corn.

484
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,403
Yeah.
That happened in the Ukraine during the 

485
00:27:33,981 --> 00:27:35,300
dq localization.
Right.

486
00:27:35,301 --> 00:27:38,240
It was against the law to go out after 
the fields were,

487
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,463
were harvested.
It was against the law to go out and 

488
00:27:41,841 --> 00:27:44,120
pick grain off the ground to feed your 
family.

489
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:44,920
Right.

490
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,110
And the prison sentence was like a 
tenor,

491
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,760
which is their little word for 10 years.
So you're going to get you,

492
00:27:49,761 --> 00:27:54,640
you steal a piece of corn or you've 
picked up corn off the ground and you're

493
00:27:54,641 --> 00:27:55,720
getting 10 years.
Yep.

494
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:00,210
You can't comprehend that.
It's very hard to conation.

495
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,700
Yep.
Worked.

496
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,450
And they were the,
the,

497
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:06,640
you know,
he does in the earlier parts of the book

498
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:09,670
when he starts going through the trials 
that they were doing on people,

499
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,490
it's completely crazy.
King Kong,

500
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,693
CAFCA.
Well that's why I hate to see the 

501
00:28:16,581 --> 00:28:19,760
kangaroo courts emerging all over,
all over the west,

502
00:28:19,761 --> 00:28:20,151
you know,
and,

503
00:28:20,151 --> 00:28:20,984
and,
and with the university sort of at the 

504
00:28:21,921 --> 00:28:23,510
forefront of that.
So we're,

505
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,383
we're building these alternative court 
systems constantly that don't follow 

506
00:28:27,201 --> 00:28:29,090
standard legal procedure and it's 
really,

507
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,110
we're messing with things that,
that we shouldn't be messing with.

508
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,550
And Yeah,
the whole,

509
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,653
I mean,
there are,

510
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,270
there are accounts,
I believe it's in the Gulag of,

511
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,720
of,
of applause after Astellas,

512
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,470
the speech,
right.

513
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:45,080
Where people would stand up and applaud 
and they,

514
00:28:45,081 --> 00:28:45,914
and they'd applaud until,
until literally the old people were 

515
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:48,824
falling over.
Because if you were the first person to 

516
00:28:50,301 --> 00:28:52,190
stop applauding,
then you were,

517
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,170
well,
it was off to the camps with you.

518
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,320
No,
he absolutely outlines.

519
00:28:55,321 --> 00:28:56,154
So that sounds so crazy to say.
And he outlines a specific thing that 

520
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:02,490
happened.
Is that right there?

521
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:05,030
These no one will stop applauding.
Yeah,

522
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,270
because they're afraid they're going to 
get ratted out by there.

523
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,360
By,
by everyone else.

524
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,253
Yeah.
Well Ben and by the people who are in 

525
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:12,750
fact watching.
And I mean,

526
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,550
you know what,
by by the end,

527
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,330
by,
by the,

528
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,163
by the collapse of East Germany,
one third of the people were in fort 

529
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,543
informers for the state.
And so if you had a family of six 

530
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:23,604
people,
two of your family members were direct 

531
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:27,910
government.
Informers you know,

532
00:29:27,911 --> 00:29:28,711
and it's,
it's,

533
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:29,460
so,
it's,

534
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,293
it's creepy in some sense.
It's a very weak word to use in this 

535
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:34,930
situation.
But I'll go,

536
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,670
when I was at New York University 
talking to Jonathan Heit about,

537
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,590
I dunno,
it was about few months ago,

538
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,043
um,
he just wrote that book called the 

539
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:44,900
coddling of the American mind,
you know,

540
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,023
and uh,
he took me into one of the men's 

541
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,083
washroom stair and there was a poster on
the wall asking students to turn each 

542
00:29:52,931 --> 00:29:57,430
other in four instances of bias or 
offensive speech.

543
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,263
And they have a whole bureaucracy that's
designed to do nothing else but 

544
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:05,440
adjudicate these instances of biased 
speech.

545
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:09,580
And these posters are up on the walls as
if this is something to be proud of.

546
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:10,743
You know,
and the same thing is happening now in 

547
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:15,250
Scotland with the Scottish police are 
doing exactly the same thing.

548
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:18,220
They're asking citizens to turn each 
other in for,

549
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,900
for hate crimes,
you know.

550
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:23,710
And the problem with that is the 
fundamental problem with that and the,

551
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,280
the unsolvable problem is,
well,

552
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,720
who defines hate and,
and,

553
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,660
and where's,
where's the line drawn?

554
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:32,261
It's like,
well,

555
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:35,560
anything that upsets me that you say is 
hate that.

556
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:39,700
And then it's worse than that.
It's like what happens is the people who

557
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:44,701
define hate ended up being those who are
looking to take offense so that they can

558
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:46,234
find someone they can define as a 
victimizer so that they can persecute 

559
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:53,080
them morally and justify that interstate
ism.

560
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,123
And those are the people who end up 
defining the laws and then they match 

561
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,270
this with the morality saying,
well,

562
00:30:58,271 --> 00:31:00,880
we're doing this to make our society a 
safe place.

563
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,720
It's absolutely,
it's,

564
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,593
it's absolutely dreadful.
And to see that happening in the UK was 

565
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:08,590
just,
it's just awful because I mean,

566
00:31:08,591 --> 00:31:10,600
you know,
the UK is a center,

567
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,610
a center,
the center point of,

568
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,000
of the idea of free speech.
I mean a lot of America,

569
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:16,863
obviously a lot of American ideals of 
America is a great center of free 

570
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:20,440
speech.
But I mean,

571
00:31:20,441 --> 00:31:21,274
it's a variation on the English system.
So to see that happening in the UK is 

572
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:26,080
just,
it's awful.

573
00:31:26,081 --> 00:31:28,450
And to see the police doing this and 
being,

574
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,570
you know,
I'm encouraged by the politicians and,

575
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,813
and,
and,

576
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:36,550
and to see this put forward as some sort
of moral action.

577
00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:37,384
It's just,

578
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,300
well,
it's,

579
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,250
it's an echo of this kind of catastrophe
that,

580
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,820
that we're discussing.
So I think about that sometimes.

581
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,360
And I also have a tendency to look at 
things in La,

582
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,500
not be too worried about it.
Like,

583
00:31:55,501 --> 00:31:56,060
Hey,
c'mon,

584
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,210
yeah,
but what's really going on?

585
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:57,691
Yeah.
Right.

586
00:31:57,691 --> 00:31:58,470
And that's,
yeah,

587
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,303
that's actually part of my personality.
And part of that comes from my old job 

588
00:32:01,261 --> 00:32:02,100
where,
hey,

589
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,760
I can't worry about these little things.
Oh,

590
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:05,520
there's some little problem going on 
over there.

591
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,770
That's not going to be,
that's not going to affect us.

592
00:32:07,771 --> 00:32:08,604
It's not going to have,
you've got to pay attention a little 

593
00:32:09,351 --> 00:32:10,440
bit,
make sure it doesn't get out of hand.

594
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,140
But that thing about speech and,
and you just mentioned the,

595
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:15,630
uh,
the Kulak is that to lax?

596
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,550
Yeah.
Yup.

597
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,980
They were the Ukrainian,
they were the Ukrainian farmers who were

598
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:20,850
good at farming.

599
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,000
When I read this part,
um,

600
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,053
it got me worried about my own personal 
lackadaisical attitude towards things 

601
00:32:29,921 --> 00:32:31,120
that I think all that's not big of a 
deal.

602
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,093
Let me,
let me read this little section about 

603
00:32:32,891 --> 00:32:33,724
the,
about the escalation of the word Kulak 

604
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,300
Yep.
And,

605
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,410
and where it started and where that,
yeah,

606
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,590
that's good.
So here we go.

607
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,530
Um,
in Russian,

608
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,393
a Kulak is a miserly,
dishonest rural trader who grows rich 

609
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:53,240
not by his own labor,
but through someone else's.

610
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,013
Yeah.

611
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,390
In every locality,
even before the revolution.

612
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:02,870
Such cool acts could be numbered on 
one's fingers and the revolution totally

613
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:06,260
destroyed their basis of activity.
Subsequently,

614
00:33:06,261 --> 00:33:07,094
after 1917 by a transfer of meaning,
the name Kulak began to be applied to 

615
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,520
all those who in any way hired workers,
even if it was only,

616
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,473
even if it was only when they were 
temporarily short of working hands in 

617
00:33:23,991 --> 00:33:25,280
their own families.

618
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:30,190
But then that doesn't stop there.
The inflation of this scaling.

619
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,200
The term of this scathing term coop 
Kulak proceeded relentlessly and by 1930

620
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,303
all strong peasants in general.
We're being so called all peasants 

621
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,600
strong in management,
strong in work,

622
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,523
or even strong merely in convictions.
The term Kulak was used to smash the 

623
00:33:50,991 --> 00:33:54,860
strength of the peasantry and I got to,
I got to go a little bit further because

624
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,560
hell of a good thing for the workers 
party to do.

625
00:33:57,561 --> 00:33:58,790
Aim Crazy.
Yeah.

626
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,043
They went further though.
Beyond this in every village there were 

627
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:03,644
people who in one way or another had 
personally gotten in the way of the 

628
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:08,120
local activists.

629
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,620
Okay.

630
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,920
This was the perfect time to settle 
accounts with them of jealousy,

631
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:13,820
envy,
and insult.

632
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:15,140
These are the people you were just 
talking about.

633
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:16,783
A new word was needed for these new 
victims as a class and it was born by 

634
00:34:22,701 --> 00:34:23,534
this time.
It had no social or economic content 

635
00:34:25,461 --> 00:34:26,294
whatsoever,
but it had a marvelous sound pop Kulak 

636
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,453
Nick,
and that meant a person eating the cool 

637
00:34:34,391 --> 00:34:35,870
acts.
In other words,

638
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,870
I consider you an accomplice of the 
enemy.

639
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,810
Yup.
And that's all it.

640
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:41,671
Yeah.
Well,

641
00:34:41,671 --> 00:34:46,671
one of the things I tried to outline in 
my forward to the abridged version was I

642
00:34:47,761 --> 00:34:51,510
was thinking about this idea of oddly 
enough,

643
00:34:51,511 --> 00:34:53,250
about intersectionality,
which is,

644
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:55,410
uh,
like social justice idea.

645
00:34:55,411 --> 00:34:56,244
You know,
that the social justice ideas that were 

646
00:34:58,681 --> 00:34:59,514
best defined by our collective identity 
and that the proper narrative in 

647
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:06,810
relationship to our collective identity 
is one of victim victimizer,

648
00:35:06,811 --> 00:35:11,160
which is a replay of the old Marxist 
doctrine of bourgeoisie and proletariat.

649
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,020
It's just in its new guys.
Um,

650
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,560
I mean in that new guys developed,
at least in part,

651
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,423
in response to the Gulag archipelago 
because the old proletariat bourgeoisie 

652
00:35:20,971 --> 00:35:21,804
distinction became morally untenable.
So it just went underground and 

653
00:35:24,601 --> 00:35:25,434
underwent this transformation.
The intersectional theorists point out 

654
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:28,794
that your status as a victimizer or a 
victim is actually the intersection of 

655
00:35:33,511 --> 00:35:36,060
your multiple identities.
And so,

656
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,110
and that's actually the Achilles heel of
the collectivist notion.

657
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:40,943
And we can get into why that is,
but there's a horror that goes along 

658
00:35:43,861 --> 00:35:44,700
with that,
that people,

659
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,863
that's not obvious,
that I think contributed to exactly why 

660
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:51,120
the Russian revolution went so horribly 
wrong.

661
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:55,140
And that is that.
So imagine that I could characterize you

662
00:35:55,141 --> 00:35:58,560
along five or six different dimensions 
of group identity.

663
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:00,180
It's pretty easy.
And while you're male,

664
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:01,014
you're male of a certain age,
you're male of a certain age and 

665
00:36:03,091 --> 00:36:05,070
economic class,
you're,

666
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:08,040
you have a certain sexual orientation,
you have a certain ethnicity,

667
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,860
you have a certain race that's six 
groups right there.

668
00:36:10,861 --> 00:36:13,110
And we could continue,
you know,

669
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,890
your parents had a certain socioeconomic
class and so did your grandparents,

670
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,770
and then your ethnic group had a certain
privilege or lack thereof,

671
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:21,623
then you're attractive or you're not 
attractive and you're intelligent or 

672
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:25,440
you're not intelligent.
And there's temple men,

673
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,840
temperamental variability.

674
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,863
Like there's all sorts of ways of 
characterizing you according to your 

675
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:30,990
group.
Okay.

676
00:36:30,991 --> 00:36:31,824
Now we might say that if we were 
compassionate people that we would take 

677
00:36:35,491 --> 00:36:36,324
one of those group identities are more,
and look at where your dispossessed and 

678
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:41,790
victimized.
Okay.

679
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:42,624
And we're gonna find some dimension 
along which are less privileged than 

680
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:48,480
some people.
Like maybe you come from a working class

681
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:51,390
background despite the fact that you're 
like a straight male.

682
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:53,730
And so you can be a victim on that 
dimension.

683
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:54,923
And so that's kind of,
that's at least in part an element of 

684
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:01,290
intersectional theory,
right?

685
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,400
And that may be your,
your,

686
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:08,620
your oppression is the product of,
of your multiple victim,

687
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,133
like identities.
But that can easily be reversed because 

688
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:14,244
it's absolutely the case that I can take
any person and I can do add 

689
00:37:17,901 --> 00:37:18,734
multidimensional analysis of their group
identities and I can find at least one 

690
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:23,970
dimension along which there the 
perpetrator,

691
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:26,100
not the victim,
they're the victimizer,

692
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,060
not the victim.

693
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,163
And as soon as I can identify a 
dimension along which there a 

694
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:32,730
victimizer,
then that justifies their persecution.

695
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,880
And so one of the things that you saw 
happening in the Russian revolution,

696
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:38,010
and it's very much akin to what you just
described,

697
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:40,160
was that the,
the,

698
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,323
the,
the borders of who who was validly 

699
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:46,194
accused of being a victimizer 
essentially expanded to include every 

700
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,430
once.
And,

701
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,450
and that's actually right in,
it's in a,

702
00:37:53,451 --> 00:37:55,230
in a perverse sense,
it's right.

703
00:37:55,470 --> 00:38:00,470
Because if you position yourself 
properly in the historical flow,

704
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,590
then you should see yourself as a 
perpetrator and a victim equally.

705
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,453
Well,
it's not the right way to see yourself 

706
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:07,500
at all.
But if you're going to play that game,

707
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:10,590
you're going to be on both sides of it.
And then that issue is,

708
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,230
and this is related to your idea about,
you know,

709
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,290
in your platoon,
you've got one person who sadistic.

710
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,311
It's like,
okay,

711
00:38:17,311 --> 00:38:21,390
well let's even assume that at the 
beginning of the Russian revolution,

712
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:22,224
that the vast majority of the people who
were motivated by communism were 

713
00:38:25,531 --> 00:38:29,910
actually compassionate with regards to 
the dispossessed peasantry.

714
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,290
Now,
I don't believe that,

715
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:35,190
but we could say that that was even a 
significant minority.

716
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,640
Well,
the question is,

717
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:38,590
do you just say on it,
what was your,

718
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,630
what was your,
uh,

719
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,460
hypothetical percentage?
Well,

720
00:38:41,461 --> 00:38:42,041
let's say,
well,

721
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:42,874
let's say it's 20% or let's even say 
it's 50% of people who are genuinely 

722
00:38:46,781 --> 00:38:49,060
motivated by compassion for the 
dispossessed,

723
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,253
but then there's another minority.
Maybe we could even say it was only 10% 

724
00:38:54,491 --> 00:38:56,890
to begin with who weren't motivated by 
that at all.

725
00:38:56,891 --> 00:38:59,980
They were motivated by the jealousy and 
the spite and the,

726
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:00,843
and the,
and the resentment that Solzhenitsyn 

727
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:03,124
describes.
And they were the ones who are after 

728
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:06,370
those to be persecuted.

729
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,880
And the thing is they got the upper hand
really rapidly.

730
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,460
And it might be because the carnivorous 
types,

731
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:13,294
the predatory types are much more 
dangerous and powerful than the 

732
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:19,060
compassionate types.
Like they'll take them out instantly.

733
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:19,690
We're,
we're,

734
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,270
we're willing to step up and smash 
someone.

735
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,890
Yes.
Most of the people that are saying,

736
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:24,850
oh,
we just want to help.

737
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:25,810
Yes,
exactly.

738
00:39:25,811 --> 00:39:26,140
Well,
and,

739
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:26,973
and there,
there's someone I actually cited a guy 

740
00:39:28,571 --> 00:39:29,404
named,
I think his name was walter lots us in 

741
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:32,230
the forward who,
who wrote,

742
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:33,064
uh,
wrote in a journal called red terror 

743
00:39:34,391 --> 00:39:37,240
that if you were interrogating an enemy 
of the state,

744
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,320
you didn't bother with niceties like 
their individual guilt.

745
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,480
That was a barrage waze,
uh,

746
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:44,890
um,
conceit.

747
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,840
And that's,
that's really important thing to keep in

748
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:47,674
mind.
What you want it to do is to do a class 

749
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:51,340
based analysis and find out,
well,

750
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:55,720
are they a member of let's say the Kulak
or the affiliates of the [inaudible],

751
00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:00,040
which is a lovely way of expanding your 
list of potential victims and then you,

752
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,170
you execute accordingly.

753
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,640
And that would mean,
well,

754
00:40:03,641 --> 00:40:06,070
the person that you're interrogating,
right?

755
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:06,904
Or The class member that you're 
interrogating and then their children 

756
00:40:08,941 --> 00:40:09,774
and perhaps also their grandchildren and
lots of himself was eventually executed 

757
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:13,744
by the Stellan.
As somebody wrote to me after I wrote 

758
00:40:15,461 --> 00:40:17,830
the foreword and told me that that was 
his eventual fate.

759
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:18,670
And I thought,
well,

760
00:40:18,671 --> 00:40:19,504
talk about standing on a chair and 
putting the new surround your own neck 

761
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,880
and kicking it out from underneath you.
It's like,

762
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,200
you know,
he basically,

763
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,770
he murdered himself fundamentally and,
and you know,

764
00:40:29,771 --> 00:40:32,680
you could say in some sense that was the
story of the Soviet Union to a,

765
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:33,514
to a tremendous degree.
There's one part going back to the ever 

766
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:38,750
expanding,
um,

767
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,280
people that need to be destroyed.
There was a point in,

768
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,900
in the book where he starts,
he's saying,

769
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:44,231
hey,
look,

770
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:45,064
there's insects Stalin's describe,
or maybe it was lennon was describing 

771
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:52,780
these certain people as insects that 
needed to be destroyed.

772
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:55,630
And then he just,
that that just starts off with,

773
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,680
hey,
people that are rabble rousers yeah,

774
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,050
they're insects.
And,

775
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,023
and then it just expands and expands and
then it's got priests and then it's got 

776
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:07,470
engineers and physicians.
Everyone in suckers.

777
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,020
Yeah.
Rec Records.

778
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,720
That's the,
that's the word that they use or that he

779
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:13,530
uses in the book for a,
for basically saboteurs.

780
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:17,230
Yeah.
And that expands beyond comprehension.

781
00:41:17,231 --> 00:41:18,064
Yeah.
Because at every single problem that 

782
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:20,704
there is,
is the fault of some person out there 

783
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,290
that sabotage and,
and they,

784
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:27,940
they do this show trial and he talks 
about it in the book for,

785
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,123
I think that,
I think the phrase that he uses or that 

786
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
they use at the rush that the Soviets 
used was organizers of the famine.

787
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,930
Meaning like,
Oh yeah,

788
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:41,390
you're starving.
And these people over here,

789
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,283
they're the reason you're,
these are the people that organize the 

790
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:44,450
famine.

791
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:45,283
They're the,
they're the records of production of 

792
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:47,234
food.
And you bet,

793
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,021
you bet.
Well,

794
00:41:48,021 --> 00:41:49,100
it was either that,
you know,

795
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:50,930
you imagine that you,
you,

796
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:56,050
you adopt a worldview and that worldview
enables you to,

797
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,433
at least in principle,
organize yourself with other people and 

798
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:02,660
to provide you with a certain amount of 
psychological stability.

799
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,913
And then things go dreadfully wrong.
And then you have a choice which is to 

800
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,580
reevaluate your worldview,
which is of course what social needs and

801
00:42:10,581 --> 00:42:11,414
does in the gulag.
Archipelago in a very deep ways 

802
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:15,480
reorganized his entire worldview.
Um,

803
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,010
or you can look for reasons why you're 
right and,

804
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:19,963
and these things are happening.
And Solzhenitsyn talks a lot in the 

805
00:42:22,011 --> 00:42:22,844
Gulag archipelago about,
see he had a moral condone drum when he 

806
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:29,090
was in prison and he started his moral 
awakening,

807
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:29,924
let's say.
And he was trying to figure out how to 

808
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:33,140
treat other people who were imprisoned.

809
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:38,180
He had a real moral conundrum when a 
committed communist was dragged into the

810
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:40,130
Gulag system,
which happened all the time.

811
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,143
And he said those people were in 
particularly dire straits because not 

812
00:42:44,781 --> 00:42:45,614
only had they been subject to the entire
tyrannical weight of the deceitful 

813
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:49,784
state,
but it was at the hands of their own 

814
00:42:51,261 --> 00:42:53,690
comrades and friends.
And then the,

815
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,520
the,
the,

816
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,353
the committed communists would enter the
Gulag and they would still be in there 

817
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:01,370
morally superior phase,
right.

818
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:02,204
That,
that their incarceration was a mistake 

819
00:43:04,341 --> 00:43:05,174
and that things would be set right.
And that there was nothing wrong with 

820
00:43:06,921 --> 00:43:09,140
the system and they would attempt to 
justify it.

821
00:43:09,141 --> 00:43:09,974
And Solzhenitsyn was no,
never sure how to react to these people 

822
00:43:13,311 --> 00:43:15,710
ethically because on the one hand,
while they were,

823
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:16,763
you know,
devastated because now they were 

824
00:43:17,751 --> 00:43:18,584
political prisoners and maybe they got a
20 year sentence and they were in 

825
00:43:21,051 --> 00:43:22,100
terrible,
you know,

826
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:24,260
stripped of their family and just 
ruined.

827
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,363
But on other hand,
they were still avid supporters of the 

828
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:28,394
very fist that had crushed them.
And so his eventual conclusion was that 

829
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,890
until they broke and repented,
they,

830
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:37,813
they weren't to be allied with,
they were still essentially on the side 

831
00:43:40,791 --> 00:43:44,410
of the wall of the perpetrator.
And it seems to me that,

832
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,680
that that's right,
that's,

833
00:43:45,681 --> 00:43:47,800
that's unrepentant sin,
let's say.

834
00:43:47,801 --> 00:43:49,340
And it isn't till you,

835
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,793
what would you say?
Until you take responsibility for your 

836
00:43:55,061 --> 00:43:55,894
own complicitness in your,
in your unfair interrogation that you 

837
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,840
get to join the ranks of,
of,

838
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:06,610
of valuable in suffering humanity again.
And so,

839
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:08,570
yeah.

840
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:10,100
Yeah.
It's the,

841
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:11,223
the extension of the persecution is 
really something that's horrifying to 

842
00:44:15,441 --> 00:44:16,274
see how,
who constituted a victimizer the ranks 

843
00:44:20,331 --> 00:44:23,510
of who constituted victimizer.
Just grew and grew and grew and grew.

844
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,433
One of the most shocking groups of 
people that ended up in the gulags were 

845
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:32,100
the dam Soviet soldiers that had just 
got

846
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:36,330
back home fighting,
just including you can't make up.

847
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:38,050
They can't make that up on committing 
assaults and mission,

848
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:43,080
who was like in close combat with the 
enemy.

849
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:46,800
And he wrote a letter to one of his 
buddies and said,

850
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:47,843
yeah,
this doesn't seem like to be a great 

851
00:44:48,421 --> 00:44:50,180
decision by Stalin.
Yup.

852
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,410
And next thing you know he's,
he's in.

853
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,000
Yeah,

854
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:53,990
yeah.
Well this stolen,

855
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,370
stolen,
decided that,

856
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:56,750
yeah,
this is something that you,

857
00:44:56,751 --> 00:44:57,584
you,
you can't,

858
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:59,990
you can't believe this while it is,
there is this,

859
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,280
like,
it's like,

860
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:02,360
you know,
if there's something,

861
00:45:02,361 --> 00:45:04,640
say titanic at the bottom of this,
you know,

862
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,533
mythologically speaking,
there's also something that's like a 

863
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:10,700
cosmic,
it's like cosmic black humor.

864
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:14,660
It's like the sign on Auschwitz that 
said work will set you free.

865
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,250
You know,
that's a joke,

866
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:17,203
right?
It's a whole,

867
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:19,010
it's a terrible,
terrible,

868
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,870
dark joke.
And so much of this has the element of,

869
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:27,380
of exactly that kind of surreal,
I hate to say humor,

870
00:45:27,381 --> 00:45:28,520
but it's,
it's right.

871
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:32,210
I mean stolen decided that the,
okay,

872
00:45:32,211 --> 00:45:36,770
so the Soviet prisoners of war were not 
covered by the Geneva Convention for the

873
00:45:36,771 --> 00:45:37,604
treatment of prisoners of war.
Castelan re refused to sign that 

874
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,113
agreement.
So like if you were an allied prisoner 

875
00:45:43,761 --> 00:45:44,594
of the Germans,
it wasn't like you were having a great 

876
00:45:46,011 --> 00:45:46,610
time of it.

877
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,400
Like food was in short supply and you 
were treated pretty brutally.

878
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:53,900
But the Soviets were kept separately and
they were doing so badly that the allies

879
00:45:53,901 --> 00:45:56,990
used to throw food packets over the 
fence when that was an option.

880
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:58,183
So the Soviet prisoners of war were 
treated absolutely dreadfully and 

881
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,740
Estelle and didn't care about that.
Um,

882
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,440
and then when they were released and 
went back to the Soviet Union,

883
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,513
his dictum was that because they had 
been exposed to the capitalist West or 

884
00:46:16,071 --> 00:46:16,904
even the Nazi west for that matter,
that they had now been intolerably 

885
00:46:20,841 --> 00:46:25,010
corrupted on ideological grounds and had
to be put in the prison camps.

886
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,340
So that was the,
that was your destiny as you know.

887
00:46:28,341 --> 00:46:29,121
I mean,
first of all,

888
00:46:29,121 --> 00:46:32,690
you were frontline Russian soldier,
which was just brutal beyond belief.

889
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,673
Their army was completely unprepared for
Hitler's invasion because Stellan 

890
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:39,200
trusted Hitler in his strange way.

891
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:40,243
And so they were completely unprepared.
And of course then fighting the Soviet 

892
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,300
Union with its winters.
I mean,

893
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,134
you just,
you just can't imagine what that must 

894
00:46:47,831 --> 00:46:48,664
have been like.
And then to be thrown in a prisoner of 

895
00:46:50,271 --> 00:46:51,104
war camp at the bottom of the rung and 
then to be brought back to your country 

896
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:00,800
and then to be imprisoned as a trader 
because as a class you'd been exposed to

897
00:47:00,801 --> 00:47:03,140
the wrong ideology.
It's like you just,

898
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,240
it's,
it's,

899
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:09,950
it's unimaginably vile and surreal at 
the same time.

900
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:11,440
And it,
it,

901
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,313
you shake your head for me,
while it's such a shock to read the 

902
00:47:15,501 --> 00:47:16,750
Gulag archipelago,
it,

903
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:20,800
you just can't,
it's,

904
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:21,920
it's like a,
it isn't,

905
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:24,440
it's like Dante's inferno.
It's like a trip into hell

906
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:25,620
and,
yeah.

907
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:28,080
And I guess your,
that's what I was trying to say when we,

908
00:47:28,081 --> 00:47:28,914
when we started this conversation,
I was trying to say that it's like 

909
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:32,070
you're watching this,
uh,

910
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:32,831
like,
like you said,

911
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:35,440
it's like a bad comedy movie and you'd 
think,

912
00:47:35,441 --> 00:47:37,540
well that's,
that'd be really that you'd think,

913
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:37,931
you know,
when you,

914
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:38,980
when you take a comedy,
well,

915
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:39,823
one of the things,
one of the ways you can make people 

916
00:47:40,751 --> 00:47:41,584
laugh is take something ordinary and 
maybe make it much more extreme in the 

917
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:47,200
more extreme you make it,
the more funny it becomes.

918
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,770
That's what like happened here.
You're looking at this thing going,

919
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:52,460
hey,
oh yeah.

920
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,950
They seem to be trying to make this 
funny because who in could ever conceive

921
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,990
that you could take your frontline 
soldiers who were captured and in misery

922
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,290
and when they return home instead of 
treating them like heroes,

923
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,920
instead you put them back into a prison.
Worst one,

924
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,780
you can't even,
you can't even,

925
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:11,950
that's just,
that's it.

926
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,080
You can't make this stuff.
You can't make it up.

927
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,453
Did you see?
I believe that movie was the death of 

928
00:48:17,291 --> 00:48:19,030
Stalin did.
I did not see it.

929
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:19,740
But that's

930
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,980
worth seeing because it's,
it's very interesting because one of the

931
00:48:22,981 --> 00:48:23,814
things about that movie is that it 
captures that surreal element because 

932
00:48:27,121 --> 00:48:28,890
it's a black comedy,
you know,

933
00:48:28,891 --> 00:48:29,724
and,
and there are comical things happening 

934
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,833
in the movie in that terrible dark way 
constantly at the same time that in the 

935
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,620
background,
genuinely terrible things are happening.

936
00:48:40,621 --> 00:48:44,680
So it's that horrible.
It's that it's,

937
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:45,523
it's got that horrible satirical flavor 
that runs through books like the Gulag 

938
00:48:49,471 --> 00:48:50,730
archipelago where you think,
well,

939
00:48:50,731 --> 00:48:51,564
there's just no,
this is so absurd that there's no 

940
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:58,791
possible way it could have occurred.
And yet that's not only did it happen,

941
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,580
there was like a contest to top the 
absurdity,

942
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:03,660
you know,
to to,

943
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,270
to consider the engineers for example,
records is,

944
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,313
well these people were building the 
Soviet system to the degree that it was 

945
00:49:10,051 --> 00:49:10,884
built and then to turn around and accuse
exactly those people of being the ones 

946
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:15,810
who destroy and undermine it.

947
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,250
It's,
it's part of,

948
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:20,940
I really think that what's what 
underlies this,

949
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:22,163
whatever this is.
And I think this is what manifests 

950
00:49:24,751 --> 00:49:25,584
itself in the worst of the leftist 
collectivism is a real hatred for 

951
00:49:29,281 --> 00:49:31,770
anything that smacks of competence at 
all.

952
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:32,723
Like I,
I tried to imagine those Russian 

953
00:49:34,231 --> 00:49:36,480
villages because I come from a small 
town,

954
00:49:36,481 --> 00:49:38,280
a small northern town too.
So I kind of,

955
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,173
I tried to imagine,
so imagine that you're in an isolated 

956
00:49:41,851 --> 00:49:42,684
village and um,
it's a peasant village and the peasants 

957
00:49:45,541 --> 00:49:47,130
weren't fried that long ago,
right?

958
00:49:47,131 --> 00:49:47,964
They were basically surfs until,
until about the middle of the second 

959
00:49:51,601 --> 00:49:55,350
half of the 19th century.
And so they had been emancipated.

960
00:49:55,351 --> 00:49:57,750
And then some of those people who are 
emancipated,

961
00:49:57,751 --> 00:49:59,640
God,
a little bit of land and started to have

962
00:49:59,641 --> 00:50:00,520
a life,
you know,

963
00:50:00,521 --> 00:50:01,354
it started to be successful peasants and
they were also the people that grew the 

964
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:05,580
bulk of the crops.

965
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:06,563
Because what you see happening in any 
productive domain is that a small 

966
00:50:09,571 --> 00:50:12,000
percentage of people do almost all the 
productive work.

967
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:12,893
So there's a small percentage of 
productive farmers who grow all the 

968
00:50:14,821 --> 00:50:15,990
crops,
right?

969
00:50:15,991 --> 00:50:16,824
And then there's all sorts of farmers 
who were only farmers by name and they 

970
00:50:19,501 --> 00:50:21,300
weren't successful at all.
So you have,

971
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:25,530
and then there was a certain 
relationship between being productive as

972
00:50:25,531 --> 00:50:26,364
a farmer and developing wealth.
Maybe you had a house and maybe you 

973
00:50:29,091 --> 00:50:30,890
could hire a person or two,
you know,

974
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,320
and which you'd think would be actually 
be a good thing,

975
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,660
especially if you are also growing food.
Okay?

976
00:50:35,661 --> 00:50:36,494
So you imagine you,
you get a village and now there's a bit 

977
00:50:38,841 --> 00:50:39,674
of a socioeconomic pyramid and there's 
some people that are doing well and 

978
00:50:42,741 --> 00:50:45,800
there are really and there.
And it isn't the crooked people that are

979
00:50:45,801 --> 00:50:49,520
really annoying that people who like the
genuine Kulaks,

980
00:50:49,521 --> 00:50:50,354
let's say that that small percentage of 
psychopathic types who were basically 

981
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,720
profiting criminally off the efforts of 
others.

982
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:58,550
Those aren't so annoying.
Those people,

983
00:50:58,551 --> 00:51:00,800
because they're rich,
but they don't deserve it.

984
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:06,130
And so they don't stand towards you as a
moral ideal that shames you.

985
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:10,220
But the really annoying people are the 
ones who are doing well and deserve it.

986
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,730
Especially if you're someone who's doing
nothing and is bitter.

987
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,631
Okay?
So now,

988
00:51:14,631 --> 00:51:15,464
so there's the village and you've got 
your people who are doing all right and 

989
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,464
then you've got a huge strout.
If people who aren't upset about the 

990
00:51:20,691 --> 00:51:23,630
people who are doing well,
they might even admire them and be happy

991
00:51:23,631 --> 00:51:24,464
that they're around because they're 
making the community thrive and growing 

992
00:51:26,421 --> 00:51:28,160
some food.
Then you have this little,

993
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:30,090
this little,
uh,

994
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,093
strata at the bottom of people who are 
ne'er do wells and on the more 

995
00:51:34,251 --> 00:51:37,190
psychopathic end of things.
And they are bitter and resentful and,

996
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,590
and waiting for their bloody 
opportunity.

997
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:42,890
And then the communist intellectuals 
come into town and say,

998
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,750
you know,
those people that are doing well,

999
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:48,680
they actually,
everything they've got is ill gotten and

1000
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,533
they,
they,

1001
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:52,100
they stole it and they stole it from 
you,

1002
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:53,300
from you.
Like,

1003
00:51:53,301 --> 00:51:55,660
and look at how badly you're doing and 
the reason you're doing badly.

1004
00:51:55,661 --> 00:51:58,790
It's because these,
these people who are lording it over you

1005
00:51:58,791 --> 00:52:02,330
and who have all this creature comfort,
they took that from you.

1006
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:03,470
It's yours by,
right?

1007
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,310
And so then all that resentment and 
jealousy and hatred and rage,

1008
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:09,920
alcohol fueled as you might well 
imagine,

1009
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,260
has this moral,
uh,

1010
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,153
reason to go with pitchforks and,
and in a mob and surround those houses 

1011
00:52:16,881 --> 00:52:18,560
and to strip them of everything they 
have.

1012
00:52:18,561 --> 00:52:19,394
And to rape the women and to kill the 
occupants or to ship them off to the 

1013
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:24,343
middle of Siberia when there,
where they froze to death because there 

1014
00:52:25,401 --> 00:52:27,410
were no,
or died of dysentery or,

1015
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,840
or,
or whatever other plague managed to,

1016
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,170
you know,
weave its way through these camps.

1017
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:36,560
And so you have the,
you have the intellectuals providing the

1018
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:41,710
moral rationale for the worst ethical 
actors in these small villages doing the

1019
00:52:42,021 --> 00:52:44,900
worst possible things under the guise of
compassion.

1020
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:46,363
Right?
And that's part of that victim 

1021
00:52:47,211 --> 00:52:48,830
victimizer narrative.
It's just,

1022
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:49,850
and,
and you knew,

1023
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:52,310
you could imagine that you can imagine a
dark night,

1024
00:52:52,311 --> 00:52:54,890
you can imagine the winter,
you can imagine the alcohol,

1025
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:55,873
you can imagine the rage that fuels 
these people who are drinking too much 

1026
00:52:59,061 --> 00:53:01,940
in the pubs that have been sitting there
for the last 20 years.

1027
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:03,200
Like,
what would you say?

1028
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:05,960
Eating up their own souls with 
resentment and bitterness.

1029
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,290
And then someone comes in and says,
you're the true victim here,

1030
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,330
and here's the people that you can go 
after.

1031
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:13,790
And then like,
if you play that on your imagination,

1032
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:17,810
you get some real sense of exactly what 
sort of horror that would produce.

1033
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,240
You know,
you think about the rape for example,

1034
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:21,980
or,
or just the theft or,

1035
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,113
but,
but it's the rape that you can really 

1036
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:25,244
think about as,
as absolute revenge for all that bitter 

1037
00:53:29,281 --> 00:53:31,740
resentment.
All fueled by the fact that,

1038
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:32,723
you know,
you'd sat there for the last 20 years 

1039
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:37,080
being completely goddamn useless and 
better and,

1040
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:38,130
and,
and,

1041
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:39,960
and angry and,
and,

1042
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,920
and,
and fantasizing about the day that would

1043
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:47,760
come where you'd have your opportunity,
God and then the whole country,

1044
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:49,880
then that was the whole country.
Oh,

1045
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,270
it's just unbelievable.

1046
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,000
Yeah.
And I,

1047
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,833
I think,
uh,

1048
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:55,520
he,
he spells that out very clearly.

1049
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:58,130
And he says it's,
you know what he's saying?

1050
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,143
You know,
I'm saying that you've got a psychopath 

1051
00:53:59,931 --> 00:54:03,440
and your platoon,
he saying that psychopath,

1052
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:04,274
all that psychopath needs to flip is,
is the someone to tell them that that's 

1053
00:54:08,061 --> 00:54:10,340
the right thing to do.
And that's exactly what happened.

1054
00:54:10,341 --> 00:54:11,330
What'd you just say?
That's it.

1055
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:12,323
Oh yeah.
Those guys that were slightly 

1056
00:54:13,221 --> 00:54:14,190
psychopathic.
Yeah.

1057
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:15,800
And then it becomes,
okay,

1058
00:54:15,801 --> 00:54:18,590
I'm the,
I'm the head psychopath and you're in my

1059
00:54:18,591 --> 00:54:19,424
village and you're,
let's say you're one of those people 

1060
00:54:21,501 --> 00:54:22,820
that are in the middle.
Well,

1061
00:54:22,821 --> 00:54:24,770
whose side are you going to be on?
I'm a psychopath.

1062
00:54:24,771 --> 00:54:25,910
If you,
if you're not on my side,

1063
00:54:25,911 --> 00:54:28,580
I'm going to kill you next.
So you go,

1064
00:54:28,581 --> 00:54:28,941
well,
no,

1065
00:54:28,941 --> 00:54:32,180
I'm on your side too.
And that's definitely,

1066
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,270
it doesn't say,
look,

1067
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:38,271
it's not like it takes much pressure on 
people to have them fold.

1068
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:40,650
I mean,
one of the things you see,

1069
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,633
you see happening right now in our 
cultures that's happening to people all 

1070
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:46,230
the time with these twitter wars.
You know,

1071
00:54:46,231 --> 00:54:47,064
someone will say something,
they'll express an opinion and then 

1072
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,460
they'll get mobbed by and,
but only abstractly.

1073
00:54:53,461 --> 00:54:55,410
Right?
It's not like there's pitchfork wielding

1074
00:54:55,411 --> 00:54:58,290
mobs at their house and I'm not making 
light of it.

1075
00:54:58,291 --> 00:54:58,651
It's,
no,

1076
00:54:58,651 --> 00:55:01,290
it's no pleasant thing to be mobbed on 
twitter.

1077
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:02,603
But that's,
that's an obstruction compared to these 

1078
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:07,380
people showing up at your house,
you know,

1079
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,513
and you,
and what'll happen is that people will 

1080
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:12,990
go through an abject apology,
you know,

1081
00:55:12,991 --> 00:55:13,531
and they'll say,
well,

1082
00:55:13,531 --> 00:55:14,610
I really didn't mean it.
And,

1083
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:15,444
and now I understand what my privileges 
and I see how what I said could have 

1084
00:55:18,511 --> 00:55:20,520
been very hurtful to people.
And you know,

1085
00:55:20,521 --> 00:55:21,354
they,
they wander through that entire apology 

1086
00:55:22,651 --> 00:55:24,490
and fold almost instantly.
And,

1087
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:28,980
and that's under almost,
almost no pressure compared to what real

1088
00:55:28,981 --> 00:55:29,814
pressure is.
A real pressure is when the wolves are 

1089
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:35,970
actually at your door rather than just 
barking off in the distance.

1090
00:55:35,971 --> 00:55:38,640
But people will fold just when they're 
barking in the distance.

1091
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:39,893
So

1092
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:40,733
there's one lawyer that he talks about 
in here is the same thing as the story 

1093
00:55:44,131 --> 00:55:45,240
that you describe,
and I forget the guy's name,

1094
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:46,074
but this guy was like the premier 
prosecuting lawyer for the Soviet 

1095
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:51,203
government.
And he just rips people apart over and 

1096
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:54,923
over again.
And as you read about what happened to 

1097
00:55:56,411 --> 00:55:57,390
him,
sure enough,

1098
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,670
he's one of the guys had been ended up 
on the,

1099
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:02,790
on the defensive and Yam being executed.
Yeah.

1100
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:05,070
Like they have all these things,
these people they built,

1101
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,600
they built,
uh,

1102
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,820
uh,
um,

1103
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:08,940
uh,

1104
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,330
place of butchery and then threw 
themselves into it.

1105
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:13,470
You know,
that's,

1106
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:13,930
and,
and,

1107
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:17,610
and you see Solzhenitsyn documents this 
very carefully.

1108
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:20,250
I mean,
Stalin killed all the people who,

1109
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:24,430
who were foremost actors in the Russian,
right.

1110
00:56:24,431 --> 00:56:24,911
So,
I mean,

1111
00:56:24,911 --> 00:56:27,880
everyone was fed into the great grinding
machine.

1112
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:29,031
So,
and,

1113
00:56:29,031 --> 00:56:30,670
and Stalin himself,
I mean,

1114
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:34,680
it looked to me like,
see,

1115
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:38,080
he got himself into something 
approximating a positive feedback loop,

1116
00:56:38,081 --> 00:56:40,420
which is a very dangerous thing to have 
happen.

1117
00:56:40,421 --> 00:56:43,780
And I think Solzhenitsyn does a lovely 
job of detailing this as well.

1118
00:56:43,781 --> 00:56:44,614
So it's like,
imagine that I have a fair amount of 

1119
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:50,440
contempt for people to begin with.
And then I find that people are,

1120
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:51,523
I'm not trusting person.
And I find that I'm very paranoid about 

1121
00:56:54,521 --> 00:56:55,354
the fact that people are lying to me.
And then I develop a certain amount of 

1122
00:56:57,281 --> 00:56:58,540
power and a reputation.

1123
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:03,550
Well then people really do start lying 
to me all the time in every gesture,

1124
00:57:03,551 --> 00:57:05,350
you know,
because every time they come near me,

1125
00:57:05,351 --> 00:57:08,740
they're absolutely terrified and they're
going to tell me anything that I want to

1126
00:57:08,741 --> 00:57:09,574
hear.
And of course then all that does is 

1127
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:15,370
validate my view of how pathetic and 
contemptible everyone is and so on.

1128
00:57:15,371 --> 00:57:16,204
The more that view gets validated,
the more I think that it's okay to 

1129
00:57:18,221 --> 00:57:21,370
destroy people because look at how 
pathetic and contemptible they are,

1130
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:24,520
how they always lie.
And all that means is that they lie even

1131
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:26,920
more.
And so this whole thing just spirals out

1132
00:57:26,921 --> 00:57:28,150
of control.
And you know,

1133
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:29,013
stellan basically started out as a,
as the brutal enforcement henchmen for 

1134
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:35,620
henchmen,
for Lennon,

1135
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:36,411
right?
The,

1136
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,870
the,
the killer for hire.

1137
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,720
And not like Lennon was above that sort 
of thing himself,

1138
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:42,220
but,
but he trained,

1139
00:57:42,221 --> 00:57:43,054
stolen and,
and then Stalin's proclivity to be 

1140
00:57:46,961 --> 00:57:49,510
murderous just kept expanding without 
limit.

1141
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:50,591
Right?
First of all,

1142
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:53,230
it was individuals and then it was 
groups and then it was nations.

1143
00:57:53,231 --> 00:57:53,981
And then,
well,

1144
00:57:53,981 --> 00:57:55,550
by the end of his life,
well,

1145
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,860
what was it,
the plot,

1146
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,560
the plot to destroy the entire world.
Tu Tu,

1147
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:03,460
Tu Tu,
Tu Tu Tu initiate the Third World War to

1148
00:58:03,461 --> 00:58:08,080
wipe out Europe to maybe destroy 
everything and like there's no limit.

1149
00:58:08,081 --> 00:58:10,210
There was no limit to that,
you know,

1150
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:13,300
and there's some evidence that that's 
perhaps why he was killed,

1151
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:16,210
you know,
because Stalin himself even went too far

1152
00:58:16,211 --> 00:58:18,630
for the horrible,
horrible,

1153
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,560
um,
what semi

1154
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:28,540
the corrupted compadres that he had,
he'd arranged around himself.

1155
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:32,680
He went too far even for them.
And thank God for that,

1156
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,240
you know?
But yeah,

1157
00:58:34,241 --> 00:58:35,074
it's,
it's,

1158
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,670
it's absolute,
I mean,

1159
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:38,583
the thing that,
that the Gulag Archipelago Gulag 

1160
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:42,334
archipelago did for me,
and this was also in keeping as a 

1161
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:45,754
consequence,
also have reading young at the same 

1162
00:58:47,351 --> 00:58:47,890
time,
but,

1163
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:49,590
but it was certainly the Goo,
like in,

1164
00:58:49,591 --> 00:58:50,680
in large part that did it.

1165
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:53,680
I would say that in some sense it's 
scared me straight.

1166
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,670
I thought,
I see the,

1167
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,680
the consequences of unethical behavior,
deceit,

1168
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:03,130
the willingness to,
to turn a blind eye.

1169
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:06,340
So even sins of omission rather than 
sins of commission.

1170
00:59:06,341 --> 00:59:07,174
Just to turn a blind eye.
The consequences of that are so 

1171
00:59:09,911 --> 00:59:13,960
absolutely dreadful that it's not 
acceptable.

1172
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,720
And I think that's the right lesson from
the 20th century.

1173
00:59:16,721 --> 00:59:18,120
It's that you,
you,

1174
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:19,120
you,
you,

1175
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:24,420
you have a much more moral role to play 
in keeping things straight.

1176
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:26,960
Then you want to believe,
you know,

1177
00:59:26,961 --> 00:59:27,920
people think,
well,

1178
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,110
my life is basically meaningless.
It's like,

1179
00:59:30,111 --> 00:59:31,580
well that's quite terrifying.
It's like,

1180
00:59:31,581 --> 00:59:32,990
yeah,
it's kind of terrifying,

1181
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,780
but it means you don't have any 
responsibility.

1182
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:38,060
So there's a big advantage to thinking 
that,

1183
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,100
you know,
not if nothing you do matters,

1184
00:59:40,101 --> 00:59:40,934
then nothing you do matters.
And so you can do whatever you want and 

1185
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,710
that's horrifying and annihilistic sort 
of way.

1186
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:48,560
But there's another kind of horror 
that's more associated,

1187
00:59:48,561 --> 00:59:49,394
I think with the horror of hell fire 
that was characteristic of the Medieval 

1188
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:53,840
Christian view is,
which is something like,

1189
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:56,990
and if you strip it of its metaphysics,
it's something like,

1190
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,400
no,
you don't get it.

1191
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:02,060
The things you do actually do the things
you do or don't do,

1192
01:00:02,061 --> 01:00:02,894
they actually do matter.
And they tilt the world towards 

1193
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,660
something approximating good,
let's say,

1194
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:12,170
or towards something that very closely 
approximates hell.

1195
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:16,130
And that's actually on you.
It's literally your fault.

1196
01:00:16,131 --> 01:00:18,650
It's literally your responsibility.
It's like,

1197
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:20,330
man,
that's a terrifying,

1198
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:21,733
that's a terrifying idea.
But I can't see how you can read this 

1199
01:00:24,351 --> 01:00:27,860
literature without coming to that 
conclusion.

1200
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:30,440
Like,
it wasn't one that I wanted to leap to.

1201
01:00:30,441 --> 01:00:31,101
You know,
it's like,

1202
01:00:31,101 --> 01:00:31,401
it's,
it's,

1203
01:00:31,401 --> 01:00:32,234
it's,
it's sort of the ultimate in horrifying 

1204
01:00:33,831 --> 01:00:34,664
conclusions that,
that everybody who participated in this 

1205
01:00:37,911 --> 01:00:38,744
system was at fault for all of it in on 
Dostoyevsky made the same sorts of 

1206
01:00:42,051 --> 01:00:42,711
claims in,
in,

1207
01:00:42,711 --> 01:00:45,140
in the last part of the 19th century.
I mean,

1208
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,510
he was a very weird,
mystical sort of person,

1209
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:48,344
you know,
and he,

1210
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,750
he made claims are some of his 
characters did,

1211
01:00:50,751 --> 01:00:52,400
but on his behalf that,
you know,

1212
01:00:52,401 --> 01:00:54,830
not only are you responsible for 
everything you do,

1213
01:00:54,831 --> 01:00:58,460
but in some sense you're responsible for
everything that everyone else does too.

1214
01:00:58,461 --> 01:00:59,294
And you think,
well,

1215
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,420
obviously there's a way in which that 
isn't true.

1216
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,820
You know,
it's delusional in some sense,

1217
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:07,880
but there's another way in which it 
actually is true.

1218
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:10,370
You know,
and so well

1219
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:11,203
I,
I wrote a book called extreme ownership 

1220
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:13,850
and it's,
it's very inner.

1221
01:01:13,851 --> 01:01:15,830
So,
so all this is as a whole,

1222
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:17,750
um,
thought here.

1223
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:18,891
So,
you know,

1224
01:01:18,891 --> 01:01:22,190
when I read the book about face,
which is not about leadership,

1225
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:23,283
it's not a leadership book,
it's a book about a guy that was in a 

1226
01:01:24,691 --> 01:01:27,170
leadership position,
but he doesn't say here's how you lead,

1227
01:01:27,171 --> 01:01:28,004
here's what you do here.
It's a book about his experience and 

1228
01:01:29,331 --> 01:01:30,164
what I took away from it,
especially because I was in leadership 

1229
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:34,820
positions in,
in the military,

1230
01:01:34,821 --> 01:01:35,654
in combat situations that I started 
seeing all these leadership things that 

1231
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,194
he did.
And there's all this crossover because 

1232
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,500
for instance,
and so for me the crossover was,

1233
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:46,334
well I started learning about tactics 
when I was a young kid cause I was in 

1234
01:01:48,711 --> 01:01:49,544
the military and the seal teams and you 
had to learn about how to fire and 

1235
01:01:51,471 --> 01:01:51,860
maneuver.

1236
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:52,693
Like that's what you do.
And then so you start learning about 

1237
01:01:55,101 --> 01:01:55,934
leadership.
And then I started training a lot of 

1238
01:01:57,531 --> 01:02:00,860
Jujitsu and so those things kind of all 
fit together.

1239
01:02:00,861 --> 01:02:01,694
And it's very strange how those things 
started to weave together in my head 

1240
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:05,331
that,
oh,

1241
01:02:05,331 --> 01:02:08,300
if
on the battlefield,

1242
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:11,390
if you want to attack the enemy,
you don't do it head on you,

1243
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:12,800
you flank them,
you distract him,

1244
01:02:12,801 --> 01:02:13,634
and then you flank them.
You come in from the other side in 

1245
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:18,260
Jujitsu,
if you want to submit your opponent,

1246
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,010
you,
you don't just grab their arm.

1247
01:02:20,011 --> 01:02:20,844
No,
you start to choke them and while 

1248
01:02:21,741 --> 01:02:23,580
they're defending the choke,
then you get their arm.

1249
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:28,500
And as a leader,
if you want somebody to do something,

1250
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:29,393
you just don't bark that order at them.
You flank them and you let them 

1251
01:02:32,371 --> 01:02:33,750
understand why it's happening.
And,

1252
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:37,710
and you know,
when I started this podcast that I do,

1253
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,740
I would say I started off by saying in 
the beginning I'd say,

1254
01:02:40,741 --> 01:02:41,574
yeah,
it's a podcast about leadership viewed 

1255
01:02:43,321 --> 01:02:45,750
through the Lens of war and atrocity.

1256
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:47,903
And the more I did it,
and it didn't take me very long when I 

1257
01:02:49,171 --> 01:02:49,591
was saying,
well,

1258
01:02:49,591 --> 01:02:50,424
it's,
it's actually a podcast about human 

1259
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:53,550
nature really is what it's actually 
about.

1260
01:02:53,551 --> 01:02:55,470
Because the better you understand human 
beings,

1261
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:56,304
the better you'll be able to do as a 
leader because you'll understand what's 

1262
01:02:58,081 --> 01:02:58,914
happening with those dynamics,
which I guess is now leading me into 

1263
01:03:00,841 --> 01:03:04,230
some sort of psychology you and just 
kind of where you ended up with him.

1264
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,990
Have you read this book?
And you said you were studying political

1265
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,550
science when you read this book and then
you said,

1266
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:09,413
oh,
you looked at the psychology of it and 

1267
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:15,540
an example that you just brought up.
And this is just what you learn when you

1268
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:17,850
read.
And when you understand history and when

1269
01:03:17,851 --> 01:03:20,430
you understand the way people think 
stolen,

1270
01:03:20,431 --> 01:03:21,264
surrounded himself with people that 
would say yes to him and anybody that 

1271
01:03:25,981 --> 01:03:27,450
didn't say yes to him,
he killed them.

1272
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:28,643
And I'll say this again.
I'll talk to military killed you if you 

1273
01:03:30,931 --> 01:03:33,660
said yes.
Yeah,

1274
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:34,920
the uh,
the,

1275
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:38,100
I'll talk to eat military for sure,
but also any business leader.

1276
01:03:38,101 --> 01:03:39,570
We talked to business leaders all the 
time.

1277
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:45,120
And you don't want people,
you don't want your subordinates or your

1278
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:49,680
superiors when you tell them what to do,
to just nod their head and say yes,

1279
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,830
you don't want that.
Now the,

1280
01:03:51,831 --> 01:03:53,190
the,
the immediate thought,

1281
01:03:53,191 --> 01:03:56,010
especially for a military guy,
they think they're nothing would make my

1282
01:03:56,011 --> 01:03:58,500
job easier than if I bark an order.
It you,

1283
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,660
Jordan,
you work from Europe,

1284
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:00,390
private,
Nama,

1285
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:01,820
captain and I barked an order.
You,

1286
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:02,813
you just shut up and go do it.
And that seems like the best thing in 

1287
01:04:04,471 --> 01:04:07,530
the world.
It's absolutely not true because there's

1288
01:04:07,531 --> 01:04:09,630
things that you know on the front lines 
that I don't know.

1289
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:12,060
And if I really want to be a good 
leader,

1290
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:14,820
I want you to push back on me and say,
Hey boss,

1291
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:16,170
we don't want to do that.

1292
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,940
Here's what's going on.
Let me tell you the situation.

1293
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:20,310
And instead of making,
you want to be able to do that,

1294
01:04:20,311 --> 01:04:21,144
you want to be able to teach your 
subordinates to do that without being 

1295
01:04:22,951 --> 01:04:24,270
insubordinate.
Right?

1296
01:04:24,271 --> 01:04:26,210
Cause then it's not a power play.
It's that your,

1297
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,800
your interests are aligned.
Our interests are aligned.

1298
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:30,870
And I actually,
when I talked to the subordinates,

1299
01:04:30,871 --> 01:04:32,730
cause I talked to subordinates to yeah.
And I say,

1300
01:04:32,731 --> 01:04:34,590
listen,
when you say something to your boss,

1301
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,410
you don't say,
why the hell are we doing that boss?

1302
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:39,530
You actually have to be very tactful.
Yeah,

1303
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:40,650
exactly.
Hey,

1304
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:41,491
hey,
hey boss.

1305
01:04:41,491 --> 01:04:42,324
Um,
I want to make sure I'm executing this 

1306
01:04:44,221 --> 01:04:45,054
exactly how you want it.
Can you explain to me why we're doing 

1307
01:04:46,651 --> 01:04:47,700
this?
So I can really,

1308
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,950
really make it happen out there in the 
field.

1309
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,320
And that's a key thing.
So,

1310
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:54,600
so these ideas of,
of,

1311
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,270
you know,
psychology I guess now as,

1312
01:04:57,271 --> 01:04:58,104
and I hate to use that word,
but because I was just calling it human 

1313
01:05:01,111 --> 01:05:01,980
nature,
but these ideas,

1314
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,180
they all kind of come together.

1315
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,930
And so now you're talking about
ownership,

1316
01:05:06,931 --> 01:05:08,550
right?
Extreme ownership and this idea that,

1317
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:10,800
hey,
I'm responsible for everything.

1318
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:13,020
And so here's what I'll get from a 
leader.

1319
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:16,110
They'll say,
well,

1320
01:05:16,111 --> 01:05:18,850
whether it's a business leader or it's,
it's very easy to use a military leader.

1321
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:19,743
So I'll get a platoon commander,
my machine gunner shot in the wrong 

1322
01:05:22,271 --> 01:05:25,150
direction.
How can that be my fault?

1323
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:28,270
Because my machine gun a shot in the 
wrong direction.

1324
01:05:28,271 --> 01:05:29,620
I'm not,
I'm not holding his weapon.

1325
01:05:29,621 --> 01:05:32,530
I'm not pulling his shirt from it.
How can that possibly be my fault?

1326
01:05:32,531 --> 01:05:34,870
That's not my fault.
[inaudible] wrong.

1327
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:36,423
Who's in charge of that machine gun?
Who's in charge of making sure he 

1328
01:05:38,171 --> 01:05:39,004
understands what it's fields of fire?
Who's in charge of making sure he 

1329
01:05:41,081 --> 01:05:43,390
understands when and where he's allowed 
to shoot you are,

1330
01:05:43,391 --> 01:05:45,130
you're the boss.
This is absolutely your fault.

1331
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,153
Had it.
Uh,

1332
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:48,520
another interesting example of the 
weather,

1333
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:50,560
the weather's bad.

1334
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,290
We couldn't execute our mission.
That's why we failed because we couldn't

1335
01:05:53,291 --> 01:05:55,240
launch our helicopters.
It's not my fault.

1336
01:05:56,890 --> 01:05:58,160
That's a hard one to argue against.
Yeah.

1337
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:00,640
Except for the fact that if you're a 
good leader,

1338
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:01,653
you'll say,
hey,

1339
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,580
here's our plan.
We're going to use these helicopters and

1340
01:06:03,581 --> 01:06:05,470
here's our contingency plan.
If there's bad weather,

1341
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:08,860
if you don't take that ownership of 
what's going on,

1342
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:12,100
if you don't take responsibility for it,
you're not going to change it.

1343
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:12,934
You're not going to fix it.
And that means you're never getting any 

1344
01:06:15,461 --> 01:06:16,570
better.
You're not going to win.

1345
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,150
Right?
But the minute you as and this,

1346
01:06:19,151 --> 01:06:23,650
and obviously this applies to you know,
people to purple,

1347
01:06:23,651 --> 01:06:25,480
then you know,
you tell people take responsibility.

1348
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:26,090
I've,
you know,

1349
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:26,923
tell him,
take ownership of what's going on in 

1350
01:06:27,341 --> 01:06:28,760
your world.
It's this,

1351
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:29,950
it's the same thing,
but

1352
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:31,161
well,
it's also,

1353
01:06:31,161 --> 01:06:31,994
it's also seems to me to be the case and
I think that this is part of the ethic 

1354
01:06:35,901 --> 01:06:37,640
that's embedded in,
in,

1355
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:41,150
it's deeply embedded in Christianity 
with the idea that

1356
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:43,753
the idea that the ultimate sacrifice 
that you can offer to the world is the 

1357
01:06:46,221 --> 01:06:48,140
sacrifice of yourself.
It's like,

1358
01:06:48,141 --> 01:06:48,974
well,
imagine that you have to sacrifice 

1359
01:06:49,791 --> 01:06:51,980
something to set the world right while 
you do,

1360
01:06:51,981 --> 01:06:52,814
obviously,
because you have to give up things now 

1361
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,960
in order to make things better in the 
future.

1362
01:06:56,961 --> 01:06:59,300
So the sacrificial ideas,
a very deep one,

1363
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:01,070
then the question might be,
well,

1364
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:02,563
well,
if you're going to sacrifice something 

1365
01:07:03,411 --> 01:07:05,510
isn't going to be someone else or is it 
going to be you?

1366
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:07,333
And I really think that's the 
fundamental question and the right 

1367
01:07:09,201 --> 01:07:11,000
answer to that is that it's going to be 
you.

1368
01:07:11,150 --> 01:07:12,440
It's your fault,
right?

1369
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:16,220
You take that on or at least you take on
that responsibility and it is,

1370
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:18,300
it's a weird thing,
weird lead,

1371
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:21,050
difficult to distinguish fault and 
responsibility.

1372
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:23,990
I think responsibility is the better way
of thinking about it,

1373
01:07:23,991 --> 01:07:27,620
but it's tied in with the idea of fault.
If it doesn't go right,

1374
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,860
if it isn't going right,
it's because you're not good enough.

1375
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,970
Now that can be crushing.
There is a problem with that like,

1376
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:38,870
and you see sometimes people who develop
like psychotic depression and they um,

1377
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:39,903
they,
they suffer from a delusional condition 

1378
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:43,183
in some sense that the entire moral 
catastrophe of the world is literally 

1379
01:07:47,031 --> 01:07:50,750
their fault and that's not there.
There's an element of that that's,

1380
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:54,140
that's not productive.
Although there's a truth in it as well,

1381
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:55,201
you know,
and,

1382
01:07:55,201 --> 01:07:56,034
and it's hard to,
it's hard to find the balance so that 

1383
01:07:58,701 --> 01:07:59,534
you can take on that responsibility 
without simultaneously being a crushing 

1384
01:08:02,571 --> 01:08:03,404
weight because there's a lot of things 
in the world that are really not good 

1385
01:08:05,391 --> 01:08:08,450
and if they're your fault,
well that's rather hard on you.

1386
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:09,643
I mean,
one of the things that the Catholic 

1387
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:15,140
church does to help people with that is 
that it gives them the opportunity,

1388
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:17,600
do sort of wash their sins off 
themselves,

1389
01:08:17,601 --> 01:08:19,160
right?
You can go to church and you can say,

1390
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:19,994
well look,
here's a bunch of ways that I've been 

1391
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:25,550
being not who I could be.
And the Church authorities say,

1392
01:08:25,551 --> 01:08:26,384
well,
you know,

1393
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:30,170
that's not good and you should 
straighten up and all of that and fly,

1394
01:08:30,171 --> 01:08:33,320
right?
But human beings are fallible and you're

1395
01:08:33,321 --> 01:08:35,110
fallible and,
and,

1396
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:40,100
and we can't just crush you because of 
your insufficiency.

1397
01:08:40,101 --> 01:08:43,540
So we'll wash the slate clean and you 
can go out there and try again.

1398
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:46,430
And it's very hard to get the balance 
between those things,

1399
01:08:46,431 --> 01:08:47,264
right?
So that you can take the responsibility 

1400
01:08:49,341 --> 01:08:51,230
on without being crushed by it.
But,

1401
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:52,633
but it's still the case that it seems to
me that it's either your fault or it's 

1402
01:08:55,821 --> 01:08:58,610
someone else's,
and as soon as it's someone else's,

1403
01:08:58,611 --> 01:08:59,444
then you better be careful because that 
idea that it's someone else's is 

1404
01:09:02,751 --> 01:09:04,910
definitely going to appeal to the worst 
in you.

1405
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,550
That's definitely going to happen.
And if you don't see that,

1406
01:09:07,551 --> 01:09:11,230
then you're naive or willfully blind 
and,

1407
01:09:11,231 --> 01:09:15,620
and all that is going to do all that.
All that that is going to do is make the

1408
01:09:15,621 --> 01:09:17,420
situation worse.
Yeah.

1409
01:09:17,421 --> 01:09:18,470
Especially because

1410
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,960
if it's not my fault and it's your fault
and I can't control you,

1411
01:09:21,961 --> 01:09:22,794
what do I do about it?
I sit there and just suffer the 

1412
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:28,290
consequences of the situation as opposed
to,

1413
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:30,090
okay,
here's what's going on.

1414
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:31,980
I'm going to take responsibility and 
ownership for it.

1415
01:09:31,981 --> 01:09:33,540
I'm gonna Change it.
Make it happen.

1416
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:36,083
You talked about turning a blind eye and
an earlier you talked about turning a 

1417
01:09:39,211 --> 01:09:43,580
blind eye to the truth,
to a situation.

1418
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:48,610
And I know there's a point in this book 
where he talks about the,

1419
01:09:49,170 --> 01:09:52,140
he's got a buddy that says,
amnesty is coming,

1420
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,760
right?
Amnesty is coming.

1421
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:58,620
Let's just keep our mouth shut.
Let's do what we're told to do and we'll

1422
01:09:58,621 --> 01:09:58,970
get,
you know,

1423
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:00,180
we'll get out.
Amazon's coming.

1424
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,570
And you know,
Solzhenitsyn says,

1425
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:04,651
he saying,
okay,

1426
01:10:04,651 --> 01:10:06,030
yeah.
And then he says to himself,

1427
01:10:06,031 --> 01:10:08,370
wait a minute,
if I'm not,

1428
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:15,170
if I'm not living in order to live,
then is it worth it?

1429
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:21,690
And this is a question that I get asked 
a lot because people get themselves into

1430
01:10:21,691 --> 01:10:26,691
situations
where they've lost some kind of control,

1431
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:31,860
whether it's they're in a crappy job,
but they've got a bad boss or whatever.

1432
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:36,230
Maybe they're in a bad relationship,
maybe their families,

1433
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,160
but they are,
they're in a situation and they,

1434
01:10:39,161 --> 01:10:44,161
and they don't know what to do.
And part of them I think anticipates the

1435
01:10:45,931 --> 01:10:48,420
answer from me to be,
listen,

1436
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:49,410
Hey,
listen,

1437
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:53,250
if you're not,
if you're not living in order to live,

1438
01:10:53,251 --> 01:10:54,120
then that's wrong.

1439
01:10:56,700 --> 01:11:01,590
But what I actually tell them 
universally almost,

1440
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:05,040
and there's a couple situations where it
goes outside this,

1441
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:06,330
but you,
it's like the,

1442
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:11,220
what I tell them is what you need to do 
right now is you need to play the game.

1443
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:16,700
You need to play the game to get the 
situation to a point where you can act,

1444
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,780
right?
So if you're,

1445
01:11:18,781 --> 01:11:19,800
you've got a bad boss,
right?

1446
01:11:19,801 --> 01:11:20,281
Yep.
Oh,

1447
01:11:20,281 --> 01:11:21,300
you okay?
You got to buy Boston.

1448
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,910
I want to tell this guy to go screw 
themselves.

1449
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:24,323
Hey,
guess what I'm going to do when my boss 

1450
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:27,510
tells me something to do that.
It doesn't make much sense.

1451
01:11:27,511 --> 01:11:28,344
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna do it and I'm going to do it 

1452
01:11:29,731 --> 01:11:30,564
well,
and what am I doing on building that 

1453
01:11:31,441 --> 01:11:32,274
relationship with him?
He started to trust me and he's gonna 

1454
01:11:33,571 --> 01:11:34,710
tell me to do something else.

1455
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:38,790
Now these things are massive cutoffs 
catastrophes.

1456
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:39,840
It's like he's telling me to do 
something.

1457
01:11:39,841 --> 01:11:40,674
Maybe there's a better way to do it.
You don't even know how to do it that 

1458
01:11:41,941 --> 01:11:45,150
way and I'm going to play that game and 
I'm going to build up that relationship.

1459
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:50,151
Now when eventually he tells me to do 
something that is totally stupid or it's

1460
01:11:50,401 --> 01:11:51,360
gonna cost,
you know,

1461
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,370
lives or money,
then when I say,

1462
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:56,730
hey boss,
that's not a great way to do it.

1463
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,950
I think I know a better way.
Can we try something else?

1464
01:11:58,980 --> 01:11:59,813
He actually will listen to me,
so I'm going to play the game a little 

1465
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:07,251
bit and I'll tell you my gut instinct.
If now I guess it's,

1466
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,300
it's easy to look from the outside and 
say,

1467
01:12:09,301 --> 01:12:10,470
hey,
if I was in this prison camp,

1468
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,670
my gut instinct is like,
okay,

1469
01:12:11,671 --> 01:12:12,504
Jack would,
you know,

1470
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:13,890
you've been through these kinds of 
things before,

1471
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:14,760
play the game.

1472
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:15,593
You're going to play the game.
Which is horrifying because part of 

1473
01:12:18,631 --> 01:12:19,464
playing that game to the fullest extent 
here or in a Nazi prison camp would be 

1474
01:12:23,071 --> 01:12:24,390
coming to capitol.
Oh,

1475
01:12:24,391 --> 01:12:25,240
you're playing the game.
Yeah.

1476
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:26,520
Yeah.
You're playing the game.

1477
01:12:26,521 --> 01:12:27,510
Yeah.
So,

1478
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:28,373
and that's really the outlying,
the things that I said that our 

1479
01:12:30,391 --> 01:12:31,224
outlying,
I always make the caveat that if you're 

1480
01:12:32,611 --> 01:12:34,860
getting asked to do something that's 
immoral,

1481
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:36,330
illegal,
or unethical,

1482
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,100
then you actually have a duty to say,
no,

1483
01:12:38,101 --> 01:12:39,210
I'm not going to do that.
No,

1484
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:40,740
that's,
that's the line which you know,

1485
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:45,090
which you reach that line in the sand 
with bill [inaudible] 16 what,

1486
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:45,541
which is,
hey,

1487
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:46,374
I'm not going to do this.
But the idea that sometimes you got to 

1488
01:12:52,621 --> 01:12:55,080
play the game and sometimes even from 
you,

1489
01:12:55,081 --> 01:12:56,580
when you just said to me,
he said,

1490
01:12:56,581 --> 01:12:57,061
well,
you know,

1491
01:12:57,061 --> 01:12:57,894
sometimes it's,
it's not right to turn a blind eye on 

1492
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:02,280
things.
And it's like

1493
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:05,063
sometimes you have to,
if you want to get yourself to a 

1494
01:13:07,261 --> 01:13:09,170
position like mine,

1495
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:10,703
it seems to me that you're making a 
distinction between discipline and 

1496
01:13:13,171 --> 01:13:17,640
strategy,
like an end and and like impulsive moral

1497
01:13:17,641 --> 01:13:18,690
responding.
You know,

1498
01:13:18,691 --> 01:13:19,524
like let's say that you are in a 
situation where you have a boss who's 

1499
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:24,480
intolerable and maybe what you'd like to
do,

1500
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:25,553
you know,
the resentment is built up over five 

1501
01:13:27,091 --> 01:13:27,924
years and you'd like to go in there and,
and yell at him and tell him everything 

1502
01:13:30,811 --> 01:13:32,130
you think and you think,
well,

1503
01:13:32,131 --> 01:13:33,450
that's the truth.
It's like,

1504
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:34,770
well,
it's actually,

1505
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:35,693
it's not a very sophisticated truth 
because you're doing as shallow and 

1506
01:13:39,121 --> 01:13:39,954
impulsive analysis of the situation.
Like it would have been the case that 

1507
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:47,820
you've already compromised yourself in 
500 ways.

1508
01:13:47,821 --> 01:13:48,654
And I'll get back to the playing the 
game issue because you do have to 

1509
01:13:51,061 --> 01:13:55,340
discipline yourself to,
and you have to discipline yourself to,

1510
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,393
to some degree,
by allowing yourself to do arbitrary 

1511
01:13:59,131 --> 01:14:01,020
things that are part of the system,
right?

1512
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:01,853
That's a necessary part of discipline.
And discriminating that from a 

1513
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:09,930
compliance with unethical activity is 
very difficult.

1514
01:14:09,931 --> 01:14:13,660
So that's a hard situation.
But let's say you're,

1515
01:14:13,661 --> 01:14:14,494
you're,
you're going to counsel someone who has 

1516
01:14:15,791 --> 01:14:18,610
an intolerable boss and they come in and
they're right at the end of their tether

1517
01:14:18,611 --> 01:14:20,320
because maybe that's why they come for 
counseling.

1518
01:14:20,321 --> 01:14:21,154
They say,
I really want to tell that son of a 

1519
01:14:21,701 --> 01:14:23,140
bitch what I think of him.
And you think,

1520
01:14:23,141 --> 01:14:24,850
well,
wait a second here.

1521
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:26,200
Okay,
first of all,

1522
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:32,010
you've already eradicated from the list 
of reasonable possibilities.

1523
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:34,323
That decision by failing to say small 
things that you could have said all the 

1524
01:14:39,821 --> 01:14:40,654
way along.
And it's not like you can just all of a 

1525
01:14:42,101 --> 01:14:42,934
sudden blurt all of that out now.
And that wipes the slate clean and that 

1526
01:14:46,481 --> 01:14:49,930
constitutes truth.
It's too unsophisticated.

1527
01:14:49,931 --> 01:14:50,830
So let's think,
okay,

1528
01:14:50,831 --> 01:14:52,750
so what is it that you want?

1529
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,430
Well,
I don't want this job anymore.

1530
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:55,413
It's like,
okay,

1531
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:56,493
now let,
let's actually have a strategy about 

1532
01:14:58,031 --> 01:14:59,740
this.
Then you don't want this job anymore.

1533
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:03,100
Can you get another job?
While I don't think so.

1534
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:05,800
Well,
so you can't just quit.

1535
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:07,630
Well,
no I can't because then I don't have any

1536
01:15:07,631 --> 01:15:09,430
money in my family.
Depends on the job.

1537
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:10,031
It's like,
okay,

1538
01:15:10,031 --> 01:15:12,240
so you can't just stop.
This does,

1539
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:13,074
that's not a viable solution.
You go out of the frying pan into the 

1540
01:15:15,401 --> 01:15:17,800
fire or you know you suck,
you suck.

1541
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:18,783
You substitute one set of unethical 
actions for another set of unethical 

1542
01:15:22,181 --> 01:15:24,490
actions that are even worse.
That's not helpful.

1543
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:25,683
All right,
so let's start thinking about what 

1544
01:15:27,551 --> 01:15:29,740
exactly it is that you want.
It's like,

1545
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:31,810
well,
maybe I want a better job.

1546
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,090
I want to work for someone who is more 
reasonable.

1547
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:35,740
Okay,
so what's stopping you?

1548
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:38,350
Well,
I don't have my cv in order.

1549
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:40,660
My resume isn't up to date.
Well,

1550
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:41,471
why is that?
Well,

1551
01:15:41,471 --> 01:15:43,570
I haven't done it for five years and I 
don't like doing it.

1552
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:44,433
Well,
why is that?

1553
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:45,363
Well because I'm kind of embarrassed 
about it because it has holes in it and 

1554
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:50,920
it shows where I'm lackadaisical and 
where I'm not prepared.

1555
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:51,754
It's like,
okay,

1556
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,620
how many things are there like that?
Well,

1557
01:15:53,621 --> 01:15:56,830
there's a bunch of things and they're 
all associated with how I procrastinated

1558
01:15:56,831 --> 01:15:58,060
in the past.
It's like,

1559
01:15:58,061 --> 01:16:00,280
okay,
what are we going to do to rectify that?

1560
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:04,030
So I'll say to people,
why don't you update your cv that that's

1561
01:16:04,031 --> 01:16:04,864
what we'll do first.
Because if you're going to look for a 

1562
01:16:05,981 --> 01:16:06,814
different job,
I'm not saying you're going to look for 

1563
01:16:07,841 --> 01:16:08,674
a different job,
but if you're going to look for a 

1564
01:16:10,661 --> 01:16:12,160
different job,
you're not going to,

1565
01:16:12,161 --> 01:16:16,900
unless your cvs updated [inaudible] 
unless you can get a good recommendation

1566
01:16:16,901 --> 01:16:18,430
from this boss that's a tyrant.

1567
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:19,390
That's right.
There's,

1568
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:20,223
you've got to play the game.
There's 10 of strategic actions that 

1569
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:24,454
you're going to have to take in order to
make yourself able to move laterally or 

1570
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:28,504
up.
And the truth is isn't going in and 

1571
01:16:31,061 --> 01:16:33,560
yelling at your boss and telling them 
everything you think about it.

1572
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:36,610
The truth is trying to figure out the 
very,

1573
01:16:36,611 --> 01:16:39,820
very difficult process of how you put 
yourself in a better position.

1574
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:42,820
And that that are like,
one of the things that's quite fun about

1575
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:47,140
this lecture tour is the letters that I 
received or the stories that people tell

1576
01:16:47,141 --> 01:16:50,740
me about switching jobs because they do 
realize that there,

1577
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:54,630
and I often talk to people about 
consulting their resentment.

1578
01:16:55,290 --> 01:16:58,600
Resentment is a really useful emotion.
Like it's really dangerous.

1579
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:01,960
It's one of the most dangerous 
psychological states,

1580
01:17:01,961 --> 01:17:02,794
I believe.
But it's unbelievably useful because 

1581
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:07,690
resentment usually only means one of two
things.

1582
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:08,733
It either means quit whining and,
and take it on because you're immature 

1583
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,113
or it means you're allowing yourself to 
be taken advantage of and you have 

1584
01:17:17,121 --> 01:17:17,954
something to say or do.
And so you want to sort out the first 

1585
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:21,973
part and find out if you're just being 
immature and you can think that through 

1586
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:26,030
and you can talk to people.
Um,

1587
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:27,591
but,
and then,

1588
01:17:27,591 --> 01:17:29,060
but if it's the second,
it's like,

1589
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:30,950
no,
you've compromised yourself in a variety

1590
01:17:30,951 --> 01:17:33,050
of ways and you have to figure out how 
to get out of that.

1591
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:34,093
And if you're resentful,
that's evidence that you have in fact 

1592
01:17:37,461 --> 01:17:38,420
done that.
Okay,

1593
01:17:38,421 --> 01:17:39,890
so now that issue would be,
well,

1594
01:17:39,891 --> 01:17:43,400
how can you set your life up so that you
can be without that resentment?

1595
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:46,310
And so that's when you start to develop 
a strategy for,

1596
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:47,100
you know,
and,

1597
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:47,933
and it,
there's actually an adventure in this 

1598
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:49,850
too.

1599
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:50,683
I mean I've had a number of clients who 
have been in jobs that they didn't like 

1600
01:17:54,081 --> 01:17:56,660
it all and you know,
they were tyrannized by someone,

1601
01:17:56,661 --> 01:17:57,494
for example,
and they were also working below their 

1602
01:17:59,331 --> 01:18:01,910
hypothetical level and we'd put together
a plan.

1603
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:02,744
It's like,
okay,

1604
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,810
you're going to make three times as much
money in five years.

1605
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,960
That's the plan.
But like that's not going to be simple.

1606
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:11,090
So you,
there's education,

1607
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,030
you gotta educate yourself,
maybe formerly cause you've got holes,

1608
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:16,550
you got to fix up your resume,
you've got to,

1609
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:19,130
you've got to overcome your fear of 
being interviewed.

1610
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:24,350
You have to start sending out like 50 
resumes a week on a regular basis and be

1611
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:27,080
prepared for a 99% rejection rate.
You,

1612
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,460
you're going to look for a different 
job.

1613
01:18:28,461 --> 01:18:29,294
It's probably going to take six months 
to a year and almost all of that is 

1614
01:18:31,491 --> 01:18:35,930
going to be rejection and you got to 
steel yourself from for that and prepare

1615
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,180
and maybe this is going to be a three 
year process.

1616
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:41,210
It's no trivial thing,
but you know,

1617
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:42,283
it's almost inevitably can't remember a 
single example where the consequence of 

1618
01:18:47,781 --> 01:18:50,090
that very careful,
detailed,

1619
01:18:50,091 --> 01:18:55,091
strategic thinking wasn't a massively 
substantive improvement in socioeconomic

1620
01:18:56,841 --> 01:18:59,570
positioning and a great movement 
towards,

1621
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:02,310
uh,
improving trajectory and,

1622
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:03,173
and,
and there's advantages even along the 

1623
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:05,114
way because even before that happens,
the fact that you're taking genuine 

1624
01:19:08,541 --> 01:19:09,374
steps to put yourself in a better 
situation immediately starts to reduce 

1625
01:19:13,221 --> 01:19:14,054
your resentment,
even if it isn't having positive 

1626
01:19:15,291 --> 01:19:18,260
consequences to begin with.
But you have to be realistic about it.

1627
01:19:18,261 --> 01:19:18,981
It's like,
look,

1628
01:19:18,981 --> 01:19:19,814
it's going to be hard to update your cv 
because you're embarrassed about it and 

1629
01:19:21,561 --> 01:19:22,394
you should be all right.
It's no wonder you're embarrassed about 

1630
01:19:24,201 --> 01:19:24,890
it.
And then,

1631
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:25,723
well,
of course you don't want to go be 

1632
01:19:26,601 --> 01:19:28,250
interviewed because you're not very good
at it.

1633
01:19:28,251 --> 01:19:30,690
And,
and there's holes in your story and,

1634
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:31,533
and your,
and you can be made nervous easily and 

1635
01:19:33,351 --> 01:19:35,020
you're not a very good advocate for 
yourself.

1636
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,400
So there's a lot of improvement that 
needs to be done there.

1637
01:19:37,650 --> 01:19:40,830
And,
and then you have to withstand the,

1638
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,410
the,
the,

1639
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:46,790
the punishment of being constantly 
rejected when you apply for jobs because

1640
01:19:46,791 --> 01:19:48,890
the baseline rejection rate,
you know,

1641
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,630
for the,
for the typical job,

1642
01:19:50,631 --> 01:19:51,464
applicant is like 99%.
It's like the rejection rate for 

1643
01:19:53,571 --> 01:19:55,160
everything.
Is this going to work?

1644
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:57,380
No.
But if you do it a hundred times,

1645
01:19:57,560 --> 01:19:59,960
it might work once and that's all you 
need.

1646
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:01,160
That's exactly it.
It,

1647
01:20:01,161 --> 01:20:01,691
you,
you,

1648
01:20:01,691 --> 01:20:02,524
you only need that once.
And so the truth there isn't to yell at 

1649
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:05,834
your boss.
The truth there is to get your life 

1650
01:20:06,771 --> 01:20:07,604
together.
Yeah.

1651
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:08,813
Um,
yeah,

1652
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:10,533
play the game.
You've gotta play the game sometimes 

1653
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:14,830
too,
to get a strategic win to me.

1654
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:18,070
And that's,
and another interesting thing here is,

1655
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:21,010
as I say,
you don't want to surround yourself with

1656
01:20:21,011 --> 01:20:22,900
yes men.
When you're in a leadership position,

1657
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:25,810
you also don't want to be your own 
personal yes ma'am.

1658
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:29,360
That he just thinks you're great and 
agrees with everything that you're doing

1659
01:20:29,361 --> 01:20:31,630
and,
and won't tell yourself the hard truth.

1660
01:20:31,631 --> 01:20:32,890
You know,
you can't lie to yourself.

1661
01:20:33,070 --> 01:20:33,903
Everything.
Every little one of those things that 

1662
01:20:34,811 --> 01:20:35,644
you just listed off are the kinds of 
things that people does lie to 

1663
01:20:38,321 --> 01:20:39,880
themselves and say,
ah,

1664
01:20:39,881 --> 01:20:42,700
you know what?
Well you don't really need that.

1665
01:20:42,701 --> 01:20:44,380
That person didn't learn anything in 
that,

1666
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:47,020
in that course.
Why should I go to it?

1667
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:47,861
That,
you know,

1668
01:20:47,861 --> 01:20:50,770
it's like if you don't tell yourself the
truth about what your,

1669
01:20:50,771 --> 01:20:52,960
what your situation is,
it's going to be problematic.

1670
01:20:53,170 --> 01:20:54,003
Just like if you don't have people on 
your team above you or below you in the 

1671
01:20:56,801 --> 01:20:58,240
chain of command that tell you the 
truth,

1672
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,313
that's going to be problematic as well,
which is something which is something 

1673
01:21:03,281 --> 01:21:04,120
that's easier.

1674
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:05,613
So the playing the game thing.
So are you thinking about that as a 

1675
01:21:08,171 --> 01:21:11,740
consequence of necessary discipline?
You know,

1676
01:21:11,741 --> 01:21:13,380
like cause,
cause there,

1677
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:14,993
because it,
it seems to be you're making two cases 

1678
01:21:17,111 --> 01:21:18,130
at the same time,
right?

1679
01:21:18,131 --> 01:21:21,370
One is that you should obviously not 
undertake unethical actions,

1680
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:22,413
but then by the same token,
and you have to subordinate yourself to 

1681
01:21:26,021 --> 01:21:27,550
the realities of the situation.
And,

1682
01:21:27,551 --> 01:21:28,384
and I think that that's psychologically 
true because you're always in a 

1683
01:21:30,731 --> 01:21:33,490
situation where if you're in an 
organization,

1684
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:34,533
there's kind of an arbitrary and 
tyrannical aspect to it because it's 

1685
01:21:36,911 --> 01:21:38,890
never working perfectly.
And then,

1686
01:21:38,950 --> 01:21:41,290
and then there's the positive aspect to 
it too.

1687
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:45,970
And so whenever you're doing a job,
it could be that you're,

1688
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:49,570
you're called upon to do things that 
well,

1689
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:50,404
what would you say that there are a 
necessary part of the operation of the 

1690
01:21:52,871 --> 01:21:53,704
machinery?
I guess that would be particularly true 

1691
01:21:54,761 --> 01:21:55,594
in military.

1692
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:57,070
Yes.
And let me give you these,

1693
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:58,500
well,
just a broad example,

1694
01:21:58,501 --> 01:21:59,520
right?
Um,

1695
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:00,653
you know,
my personality and my reputation is 

1696
01:22:05,761 --> 01:22:06,470
that,
you know,

1697
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:07,500
when I was in the military,
it's like,

1698
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:08,550
oh,
it's Jocko.

1699
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:09,650
He,
he's not going to,

1700
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:10,380
you know,
he's,

1701
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:11,213
if,
if someone tells him to do something he 

1702
01:22:11,851 --> 01:22:13,350
doesn't want to do,
he's just going to say,

1703
01:22:13,351 --> 01:22:14,640
screw you.
We're not doing it.

1704
01:22:14,641 --> 01:22:16,140
We're doing it my way.
You know,

1705
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:17,430
um,
I got the knock.

1706
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:18,323
But that was kind of the impression 
people would get from me if they didn't 

1707
01:22:21,001 --> 01:22:22,140
know me from the outside,
they think,

1708
01:22:22,141 --> 01:22:22,974
oh,
this guy's a knuckle dragger he's just 

1709
01:22:24,031 --> 01:22:25,450
going to go forward.
He,

1710
01:22:25,451 --> 01:22:26,284
he's just going to make things happen 
and he's not going to listen to anyone 

1711
01:22:28,051 --> 01:22:28,884
else.
That was the impression from the 

1712
01:22:29,941 --> 01:22:32,330
outside.
The reality is a,

1713
01:22:32,331 --> 01:22:34,330
you,
you can't do that and,

1714
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:35,223
and be,
the reality is w w what my actions I'd 

1715
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:38,491
have,
you know,

1716
01:22:38,491 --> 01:22:39,780
a young lieutenant would come to me and 
say,

1717
01:22:39,781 --> 01:22:40,171
Hey,
you know,

1718
01:22:40,171 --> 01:22:42,030
my boss has to tell me to do this,
this and this.

1719
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:44,190
And what they think I was going to say 
is like,

1720
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:45,690
Bro,
you don't do that.

1721
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:46,720
Stand up.
You tell him,

1722
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,630
screw you.
That doesn't make any sense.

1723
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:51,660
And they'd be,
they'd get this look in their eyes of,

1724
01:22:51,661 --> 01:22:53,460
of surprise when I'd say,
oh,

1725
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,620
your boss wants you to do that.
Do it,

1726
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:57,960
do it well,
play the game.

1727
01:22:57,990 --> 01:22:59,340
That's what I'm telling you to do is 
play the game.

1728
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:01,050
Because these things are meaningless.
It's some,

1729
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,970
you know,
something is pathetic.

1730
01:23:02,971 --> 01:23:03,481
It's like,
Oh,

1731
01:23:03,481 --> 01:23:05,040
you got to fill out a form a certain 
way.

1732
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:05,943
It's like,
Hey,

1733
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:08,500
shut up and play the game.
You'll look even my,

1734
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:11,020
so is that a matter?
It'll matter of picking your battles.

1735
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:12,123
It's,
it's certainly is a matter of picking 

1736
01:23:13,151 --> 01:23:15,520
your battles and you as cause that's 
part of strategy,

1737
01:23:15,521 --> 01:23:17,470
right?
Everything can't be the war.

1738
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:20,590
Exactly.
And it's exactly what it is.

1739
01:23:20,590 --> 01:23:22,450
But you know,
a good example,

1740
01:23:22,451 --> 01:23:25,870
and we wrote about it in,
in a dichotomy of leadership,

1741
01:23:25,871 --> 01:23:26,740
which is,
you know,

1742
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,200
my friend,
my guy that worked for me,

1743
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,153
Leif Babin,
we were getting told to do all this 

1744
01:23:31,901 --> 01:23:33,570
paperwork.
You gotta,

1745
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:35,140
you gotta fill out these forms.
You've got to,

1746
01:23:35,141 --> 01:23:37,540
you got to have a serialized inventory 
of everything.

1747
01:23:37,541 --> 01:23:38,860
It's got to be signed off this many 
days.

1748
01:23:38,861 --> 01:23:39,694
We need to know the qualifications of 
each and every person and when their 

1749
01:23:42,341 --> 01:23:43,174
qualifications come up,
do and all these just ridiculous 

1750
01:23:45,611 --> 01:23:49,270
paperwork.
And lafe came to me and with,

1751
01:23:49,271 --> 01:23:50,950
with the other platoon commander guy 
named Seth,

1752
01:23:50,951 --> 01:23:52,060
he came to me and said,
Oh man,

1753
01:23:52,061 --> 01:23:54,910
this is bullshit.
Why do we gotta do all this paperwork?

1754
01:23:54,980 --> 01:23:56,770
We're,
we're here training for war.

1755
01:23:56,771 --> 01:23:58,720
We're getting ready for war.
Why we got to do this?

1756
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:00,243
And you know,
life will tell you his expectation was 

1757
01:24:03,011 --> 01:24:04,240
that I was going to be like,
you're right,

1758
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:06,340
I'm going to go to the commanding 
officer and tell him,

1759
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:06,760
screw this.

1760
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:08,530
We're not doing this stuff.
This is crap.

1761
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:10,060
We're trying to prep because we were in 
training,

1762
01:24:10,061 --> 01:24:12,700
getting ready to deploy to Iraq.
This is crap.

1763
01:24:12,701 --> 01:24:15,250
We're not doing this.
And I looked at him and said,

1764
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:16,263
oh,
we're doing all of this paperwork and 

1765
01:24:18,191 --> 01:24:19,510
not only are we going to do this 
paperwork,

1766
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:21,310
we're going to do it better than anyone 
else,

1767
01:24:21,311 --> 01:24:23,380
and we're going to turn it in before 
it's even do.

1768
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:24,850
And you know,
we,

1769
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:26,830
both him and seth were kind of taken a 
back then.

1770
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:29,890
The fact that I wasn't standing up and 
saying,

1771
01:24:29,891 --> 01:24:33,760
we're not doing this rap.
And then I explained to me,

1772
01:24:33,761 --> 01:24:34,594
here's what we're doing.
We're building a relationship with my 

1773
01:24:36,851 --> 01:24:37,681
commanding officer,
with a,

1774
01:24:37,681 --> 01:24:38,514
our commanding officer.
We're going to do these little things 

1775
01:24:40,361 --> 01:24:41,194
for him.
We're going to play the game because at 

1776
01:24:43,241 --> 01:24:45,100
some 0.2 things are gonna happen.
Number one,

1777
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,570
we want to build trust with my boss.

1778
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:48,610
I want my boss to look at me.
And when he tells me to do,

1779
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:50,380
to fill out paperwork,
he knows is going to be filled out.

1780
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,750
If he wants me to take down a building,
he knows it's going to get taken out.

1781
01:24:52,751 --> 01:24:53,890
If he wants me to execute,
uh,

1782
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:55,990
a larger mission,
I'll go and get it done.

1783
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:58,630
We're bill.
If I can't fill out paperwork correctly,

1784
01:24:58,990 --> 01:24:59,823
how can he trust me to go on an,
on a real operation and have guys lives 

1785
01:25:03,101 --> 01:25:05,680
at risk?
So the idea is like,

1786
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:07,270
hey,
we're gunna play the game.

1787
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:10,780
And I think sometimes people start to 
hear me,

1788
01:25:10,781 --> 01:25:11,614
they start to listen to me.
And their first instinct is Jocko 

1789
01:25:14,681 --> 01:25:18,550
wouldn't put up with them shit.
And that's why these,

1790
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:19,990
you know,
they'll hit me up the same thing.

1791
01:25:19,991 --> 01:25:22,210
They'll write me an email,
they'll write me a letter and say,

1792
01:25:22,211 --> 01:25:23,650
here's the situation I'm in.

1793
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,390
Um,
whether it's a boss,

1794
01:25:25,391 --> 01:25:26,280
whether it's a military,
it's,

1795
01:25:26,281 --> 01:25:28,480
it's any of them,
whether it's their wife,

1796
01:25:28,710 --> 01:25:31,990
like,
like my wife expects me not to train.

1797
01:25:31,991 --> 01:25:35,350
Jujitsu is something as stupid as that.
Like my wife won't let me train.

1798
01:25:35,351 --> 01:25:37,630
It's driving me crazy.
It's really starting to bother me.

1799
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:39,250
Why?
Why won't you?

1800
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:40,330
Well,
what's the problem?

1801
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:42,310
Hey,
have you taken her out for dinner?

1802
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,353
You know what I mean?
Like play the damn game a little bit so 

1803
01:25:45,761 --> 01:25:46,594
that you can win strategic.
And it's the same thing I think with 

1804
01:25:49,181 --> 01:25:50,890
your,
with the 12 rules where you're like,

1805
01:25:50,891 --> 01:25:52,630
hey,
tell the truth or at least don't lie.

1806
01:25:52,810 --> 01:25:53,643
It's like I get it.
But there is a dichotomy in that 

1807
01:25:56,201 --> 01:25:59,710
statement and that is if you run around 
telling the absolute truth,

1808
01:25:59,711 --> 01:26:00,544
everyone is going to be like that Jim 
Carey movie where he can't say anything 

1809
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:04,340
that's not a hundred percent true.

1810
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:05,180
And he's,
you know,

1811
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:07,850
a woman says good morning and he says,
you look fat.

1812
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:10,130
You know what it's like one of those 
like [inaudible] not good.

1813
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,830
And so you got to learn to play the 
game.

1814
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:14,780
And I guess again going back to this 
book,

1815
01:26:14,781 --> 01:26:19,781
it's like that's a tough call to make in
these situations.

1816
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:20,683
How much do you play the game?
And there's an ethical line that you 

1817
01:26:22,821 --> 01:26:24,950
could cross at some point.
If I become a Cappo,

1818
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:29,450
hey you just,
you played the game and you went too far

1819
01:26:29,451 --> 01:26:32,330
with it.
And just like in a leadership situation,

1820
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:34,003
if I,
if you're my boss and I'm just kissing 

1821
01:26:35,061 --> 01:26:38,180
your ass and do one of my guys lose 
respect for me,

1822
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,580
yeah,
my team will lose respect from me if you

1823
01:26:40,581 --> 01:26:42,200
tell me to do something completely 
stupid.

1824
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:42,981
And I said,
hey guys,

1825
01:26:42,981 --> 01:26:43,580
that's what the boss says.

1826
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:44,413
We're doing it.
My guys will lose respect for me and I 

1827
01:26:46,161 --> 01:26:46,994
won't be,
I won't be able to execute missions the 

1828
01:26:49,851 --> 01:26:52,670
way I should.
If when the pushback is proper,

1829
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:53,623
I say,
hey,

1830
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:55,460
Hey Boston,
that doesn't make any sense.

1831
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:58,010
We shouldn't do that.
And I go to the guys and say,

1832
01:26:58,011 --> 01:26:59,150
listen,
I told,

1833
01:26:59,151 --> 01:27:00,620
I talked to him,
we're going to see what he says,

1834
01:27:00,621 --> 01:27:03,110
but trust me,
if we have to do this,

1835
01:27:03,111 --> 01:27:05,120
we'll,
we'll figure out a way to make it work.

1836
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:07,730
Because if you're just the guy that's 
totally on board.

1837
01:27:07,731 --> 01:27:10,460
If you're a brown noser right,
your P,

1838
01:27:10,490 --> 01:27:13,040
your guys will lose respect for you 100%
they will,

1839
01:27:13,041 --> 01:27:13,874
they'll lose respect for you if you 
don't play the game at all and you'd 

1840
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:19,460
push back on everything that your boss 
says you're going to,

1841
01:27:19,461 --> 01:27:20,690
you're not going to get fire.
Yeah.

1842
01:27:20,691 --> 01:27:22,010
That's another ethical situation.

1843
01:27:22,010 --> 01:27:22,843
Like if my boss and my boss and you told
me to do something that's I don't 

1844
01:27:25,401 --> 01:27:30,380
believe in or it's like a bad plan and I
may I draw the line in the sand and say,

1845
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:31,820
screw you Jordan,
we're not doing it.

1846
01:27:31,821 --> 01:27:32,870
You can fire me.
You're like,

1847
01:27:32,871 --> 01:27:33,351
okay,
fine.

1848
01:27:33,351 --> 01:27:35,840
You fire me.
You get some yes man to come in.

1849
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:38,690
He takes my guys out on the mission and 
gets them all killed.

1850
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:42,590
He didn't mitigate the risk properly.
It's better for me ethically to say,

1851
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:44,053
Hey,
look,

1852
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:46,220
Jordan,
I don't agree with this plan.

1853
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:47,840
I really wish we could do it another 
way.

1854
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:49,550
Is there any way I could flex on it?
You say,

1855
01:27:49,551 --> 01:27:50,510
nope,
you're doing it this way.

1856
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:53,210
It is better for me in many situations 
to say,

1857
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:54,410
okay,
I got it.

1858
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:58,250
I'll make an indication of the 
complexity of the truth.

1859
01:27:58,251 --> 01:27:59,084
I mean,
one of the rules of thumb that I think 

1860
01:28:01,161 --> 01:28:04,100
is worth abiding by,
and I guess this is something that makes

1861
01:28:04,101 --> 01:28:09,101
me somewhat conservative in some ways,
is that you should do what everyone else

1862
01:28:09,921 --> 01:28:12,260
does unless there's a very good reason 
not to.

1863
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:15,920
And then I think that's,
I think that's the same idea that you're

1864
01:28:15,921 --> 01:28:18,920
putting forward,
which is that if you,

1865
01:28:18,921 --> 01:28:19,754
if you do fight back against everything,
then you're just a rebel without a 

1866
01:28:22,191 --> 01:28:23,024
cause,
right?

1867
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:26,180
And you discredit yourself entirely.
And if you accept everything,

1868
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:27,014
well then you're not even there.
And so there's some judicious analysis 

1869
01:28:30,321 --> 01:28:31,154
of the situation that helps you 
understand when the time for action is 

1870
01:28:33,861 --> 01:28:34,694
right.
And most of the time what you're doing 

1871
01:28:37,611 --> 01:28:40,400
in life is you're doing what other 
people do.

1872
01:28:40,401 --> 01:28:43,790
And that's going along with the game.
That's part of being socialized.

1873
01:28:43,791 --> 01:28:47,240
But there's going to be times when the 
right thing to do is to break a rule and

1874
01:28:47,241 --> 01:28:49,310
to do it very carefully.
And so,

1875
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:52,730
and if there's a,
there's a,

1876
01:28:52,731 --> 01:28:53,990
there's a,
there's a scene,

1877
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:55,183
I think this is a new testament scene,
but it might be in some of the 

1878
01:28:57,441 --> 01:28:58,330
Apocryphal,
right?

1879
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:00,140
Apocryphal writings.
I don't remember.

1880
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:01,980
So Christ is walking down the road

1881
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,810
on the Sabbath and there's,
uh,

1882
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:07,560
there's a ditch by the road and it's 
very hot.

1883
01:29:07,950 --> 01:29:10,710
And in the ditch there's a whole,
and in the whole there's a sheep.

1884
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:12,053
And so the sheep is stuck in the hole 
and this guy shepherd is trying to get 

1885
01:29:15,091 --> 01:29:17,670
the sheep out of the hole.
And Christ walks by and he says,

1886
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,820
if you don't understand what you're 
doing,

1887
01:29:20,821 --> 01:29:23,220
you're a transgressor of the law and 
your curse.

1888
01:29:23,221 --> 01:29:25,110
But if you do understand what you're 
doing,

1889
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:27,470
then you're blessed.
So it's,

1890
01:29:27,471 --> 01:29:29,190
it's,
it's a perfect example of that.

1891
01:29:29,191 --> 01:29:30,024
A,
because it's,

1892
01:29:30,070 --> 01:29:32,820
it's like if you're okay now here's your
situation.

1893
01:29:32,821 --> 01:29:35,040
You're a shepherd and you're supposed to
be taken care of that sheep,

1894
01:29:35,130 --> 01:29:36,900
right?
But it's the Sabbath Day,

1895
01:29:36,901 --> 01:29:38,820
so you're not supposed to be work.
Now,

1896
01:29:38,821 --> 01:29:42,990
if you have decided you've thought this 
through,

1897
01:29:42,991 --> 01:29:43,824
you think it's the Sabbath Day.
This is something that everybody needs 

1898
01:29:46,081 --> 01:29:47,880
because everybody needs to take a rest.

1899
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:48,983
And this is a rule I shouldn't break 
because everybody needs to take a rest 

1900
01:29:51,690 --> 01:29:53,280
or,
or things degenerate.

1901
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:56,850
And I understand that and I have a lot 
of respect for it,

1902
01:29:57,180 --> 01:30:01,800
but I think that in this situation,
it's still morally appropriate for me to

1903
01:30:01,801 --> 01:30:02,634
break that rule in this slight way and 
get this poor sheep out of this hole 

1904
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:06,740
then,
well,

1905
01:30:06,741 --> 01:30:07,574
Christ's judgment was,
well then you're exactly on the right 

1906
01:30:09,661 --> 01:30:10,494
track.
But if you're doing it carelessly and 

1907
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:13,200
stupidly,
you're breaking that rule,

1908
01:30:13,380 --> 01:30:16,140
then we are a transgressor of the law 
and you're cursed.

1909
01:30:16,141 --> 01:30:19,020
And I think that's exactly at the 
essence of what you're describing.

1910
01:30:19,021 --> 01:30:23,880
It's like you play by the rules,
but then there's a matter of rule,

1911
01:30:23,881 --> 01:30:25,770
which is now,
and then you break the rules.

1912
01:30:25,771 --> 01:30:26,604
And you do that very,
very carefully because when you break 

1913
01:30:28,141 --> 01:30:30,450
the rules,
you're breaking the rules.

1914
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:34,260
And the rules are what keep peace they 
and what keep peace in order.

1915
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:38,340
And so you break them only in the 
service of a higher piece in order.

1916
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,770
And so that seems to be,
and I think that's,

1917
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:41,753
you see this in in well this sorts of 
stories that are influencing even the 

1918
01:30:45,631 --> 01:30:47,850
things that you're writing.
Like in the Harry Potter series,

1919
01:30:47,851 --> 01:30:49,740
for example,
Harry's,

1920
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:50,813
um,
friends and compatriots are quite 

1921
01:30:53,310 --> 01:30:54,310
disciplined.
Her mind,

1922
01:30:54,311 --> 01:30:55,144
he in particular,
cause she's an absolute master of her 

1923
01:30:56,761 --> 01:30:57,594
craft,
but they still break rules when it's 

1924
01:30:59,191 --> 01:31:01,140
necessary,
only when it's necessary.

1925
01:31:01,141 --> 01:31:01,974
And that's what makes them more than the
people who are just breaking rules all 

1926
01:31:06,331 --> 01:31:07,440
the time,
the villains,

1927
01:31:07,441 --> 01:31:10,260
so to speak,
and also makes them more than the people

1928
01:31:10,261 --> 01:31:14,100
that are just being good by being 
conformist.

1929
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:17,820
So you need that,
that touch of rebelliousness,

1930
01:31:17,821 --> 01:31:20,490
but it's gotta be a flavoring and not 
the whole diet.

1931
01:31:20,770 --> 01:31:21,603
Absolutely.
I've actually talked about that on this 

1932
01:31:22,961 --> 01:31:27,961
podcast before.
There's people in the military that they

1933
01:31:28,361 --> 01:31:29,194
are like met are rule followers.
These are people that have been 

1934
01:31:32,531 --> 01:31:33,364
following rules their whole lives and 
they've got perfect grades and they 

1935
01:31:36,281 --> 01:31:36,970
were,
the team came,

1936
01:31:36,970 --> 01:31:39,240
they were all of these things and 
they're,

1937
01:31:39,241 --> 01:31:41,710
they're going to make really good solid 
leaders.

1938
01:31:41,711 --> 01:31:42,544
Like they're going to be great leaders.
But then there's this like one group 

1939
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:46,833
above them have that same thing,
but they also have that little bit of 

1940
01:31:50,801 --> 01:31:52,240
rebellion that they'll say,
you know what,

1941
01:31:52,241 --> 01:31:55,270
we're not doing that.
It doesn't make any sense.

1942
01:31:55,690 --> 01:31:57,340
And that is really a,
uh,

1943
01:31:57,610 --> 01:31:59,830
uh,
an important factor to have.

1944
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:00,430
Yeah.

1945
01:32:00,430 --> 01:32:01,400
But you know,
it's one of the reasons I would,

1946
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:02,590
this guy,
Colonel David Hackworth,

1947
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:03,633
this guy was the ultimate rule follower 
for his whole career at the end in 

1948
01:32:08,891 --> 01:32:11,350
Vietnam.
He did an interview and said,

1949
01:32:11,351 --> 01:32:13,990
if we keep fighting this way,
we're not going to win this war.

1950
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:17,590
And they drove him out of the army.
But that's,

1951
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:19,570
that's the thing that,
cause all along the way,

1952
01:32:19,571 --> 01:32:21,250
there was other times where he do that,
you know,

1953
01:32:21,251 --> 01:32:23,480
his guys weren't getting taken care of.
He'd break a rule and bring them be,

1954
01:32:23,481 --> 01:32:24,101
or he'd do it,
you know,

1955
01:32:24,101 --> 01:32:25,600
he didn't,
he do that along the way.

1956
01:32:25,601 --> 01:32:26,434
Not,
not so far outside the bonds that it 

1957
01:32:28,331 --> 01:32:30,760
would jeopardize his career because if 
he would do that,

1958
01:32:30,761 --> 01:32:32,230
then you're not in charge of these guys 
anymore.

1959
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:35,890
Now you're not going to have any impact.
So let's not get fired.

1960
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:38,920
Right.
Let's get stupidly fired.

1961
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:41,740
That's not an improvement.
Exactly.

1962
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:44,920
Well that's uh,
awesome.

1963
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:46,750
Uh,
I guess we,

1964
01:32:46,751 --> 01:32:47,584
I know you've got to go,
so I can't think that we could get to a 

1965
01:32:50,441 --> 01:32:55,180
better little crust of the a or little 
capstone of the conversation then.

1966
01:32:55,181 --> 01:32:56,240
Right there.
Uh,

1967
01:32:56,770 --> 01:32:57,970
thanks for coming on again.
Hey,

1968
01:32:57,971 --> 01:32:58,804
my pleasure man.
And I'm glad we got a chance to talk 

1969
01:33:00,431 --> 01:33:01,264
about this book.
This is a book that everybody should 

1970
01:33:02,411 --> 01:33:04,080
read and,
and you,

1971
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:06,070
you,
I ordered the,

1972
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:08,560
well,
I ordered a copy of yours with the Ford.

1973
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:09,610
Yup.
From Europe.

1974
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:12,940
You can't buy it from Amazon here.
You have to buy it from Amazon,

1975
01:33:12,941 --> 01:33:14,230
so it'll be here.
When will it be?

1976
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:15,073
I don't know.
We're still negotiating the rights 

1977
01:33:16,331 --> 01:33:19,570
because the rights holders differ in 
North America and so that's the issue at

1978
01:33:19,571 --> 01:33:20,201
the moment.
So,

1979
01:33:20,201 --> 01:33:22,540
okay.
So I worked with an English publisher,

1980
01:33:22,541 --> 01:33:25,240
Penguin in,
in the UK that put out the,

1981
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:27,730
I think it's vantage books,
if I remember correctly.

1982
01:33:27,970 --> 01:33:30,370
I should just check and make sure that 
that's exactly right.

1983
01:33:31,330 --> 01:33:34,660
Harper perennial modern classics.
That's not,

1984
01:33:34,661 --> 01:33:35,494
that's not the British won the British.
The British one hasn't gotten to my 

1985
01:33:39,311 --> 01:33:41,080
house.
Yeah,

1986
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:43,540
it has to be ordered.
It has to be ordered through Amazon UK.

1987
01:33:43,541 --> 01:33:44,374
And we're,
we're working on a couple of things 

1988
01:33:45,731 --> 01:33:50,260
maybe to also maybe get the audio rights
to the abridged version because I'd like

1989
01:33:50,261 --> 01:33:51,580
to read it.
Nice.

1990
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:53,710
And that would be good so that people 
could listen to it.

1991
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:56,450
And so because it's,
it's an absolutely necessary book.

1992
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:57,730
Yeah.
And it's written actually.

1993
01:33:58,350 --> 01:34:00,790
I like it cause it's written very 
conversation.

1994
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,580
I mean he's cracking jokes in there.
He's making,

1995
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:05,860
it's a brilliant piece of literature as 
well as,

1996
01:34:06,030 --> 01:34:07,690
I mean it,
it's a very readable book,

1997
01:34:07,691 --> 01:34:12,100
although it's unbelievably harsh and 
demanding and draining to read,

1998
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,050
but it's,
it's brilliantly written.

1999
01:34:14,051 --> 01:34:19,051
It's an unbelievably engrossing read and
in the most horrible possible way.

2000
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:20,761
But,
and,

2001
01:34:20,761 --> 01:34:24,100
and it is the case that it's written at 
this white hot pace.

2002
01:34:24,101 --> 01:34:24,934
You know,
it's like talking to someone who's 

2003
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:28,960
righteously,
not self righteously angry,

2004
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:32,020
but righteously angry for fur ball,
for,

2005
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:33,970
for,
for dozens of hours.

2006
01:34:33,971 --> 01:34:36,940
And he just can't believe the levels of 
outrage that are,

2007
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:38,043
that are being,
that are being so incredibly well 

2008
01:34:43,361 --> 01:34:45,760
expressed and so effectively expressed.
And,

2009
01:34:45,820 --> 01:34:46,631
and,
and again,

2010
01:34:46,631 --> 01:34:47,464
I,
I think it's also worth emphasizing the 

2011
01:34:49,751 --> 01:34:50,980
fact that,
you know,

2012
01:34:50,981 --> 01:34:51,814
Solzhenitsyn's real contribution in many
ways was to lay the catastrophe at the 

2013
01:34:56,201 --> 01:34:58,730
feet of the doctrine.
And not to say no,

2014
01:34:58,731 --> 01:34:59,564
this,
this wasn't an aberration because of 

2015
01:35:00,951 --> 01:35:01,784
Stella North in Oh,
Lennon being the great leader and then 

2016
01:35:03,951 --> 01:35:07,370
Stella and being the monster because 
Lennon was plenty monster himself.

2017
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:08,563
Um,
and Stellan was the logical conclusion 

2018
01:35:10,221 --> 01:35:12,140
to len and not,
not an aberration,

2019
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:13,273
but to say that no,
the horrors of what happened in the 

2020
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:16,993
Soviet Union were,
were implicit in the collectivists 

2021
01:35:19,581 --> 01:35:23,810
system utopian system that gave rise to 
the philosophy to begin with.

2022
01:35:23,810 --> 01:35:24,643
And that that's also an explanation why 
the same catastrophes occurred wherever 

2023
01:35:27,891 --> 01:35:32,000
the Soviet system was applied everywhere
else in the world at something we really

2024
01:35:32,001 --> 01:35:32,834
need to know.
I mean we fought a whole cold war over 

2025
01:35:34,221 --> 01:35:35,054
that.
We put damn near put the world to the 

2026
01:35:36,111 --> 01:35:36,944
torch because of this and the idea that 
these ideas are the fact that these 

2027
01:35:41,091 --> 01:35:43,340
ideas are creeping back is really,
um,

2028
01:35:43,430 --> 01:35:44,263
it's unbearable as far as I'm concerned.
So we'll hopefully people reading this 

2029
01:35:48,861 --> 01:35:49,694
book and the,
the rerelease of this book with your 

2030
01:35:51,921 --> 01:35:54,080
forward will prevent that from 
happening.

2031
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:55,333
At least it,
hopefully it will be a drop in a bucket 

2032
01:35:58,371 --> 01:36:01,220
that many other people can put drops 
into as well.

2033
01:36:01,550 --> 01:36:02,383
And so I'm hoping,
I mean I think the book has sold 15,000 

2034
01:36:05,001 --> 01:36:08,450
copies since the beginning of November,
which is pretty good for the reissue.

2035
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:10,340
An old classic.
But like it,

2036
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:11,333
it,
it's required reading for an informed 

2037
01:36:13,731 --> 01:36:16,520
citizen of the 21st century.
It's not optional.

2038
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:19,520
You need to know this material.
You're not,

2039
01:36:19,970 --> 01:36:20,803
you're not,
you don't understand your position in 

2040
01:36:23,151 --> 01:36:27,230
society as an individual or a citizen 
without knowing this material.

2041
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:30,380
So it's like not knowing about what 
happened in Nazi Germany.

2042
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:35,150
It's not acceptable to not know.
So read the book.

2043
01:36:35,450 --> 01:36:37,580
Thanks for coming George.
Really good to see you again man.

2044
01:36:37,790 --> 01:36:38,600
Absolutely.
Yeah,

2045
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:39,830
you bet.
I appreciate it.

2046
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:42,303
And with that,
Jordan Peterson has departed the 

2047
01:36:46,570 --> 01:36:47,403
recording studio and if you noticed that
Echo Charles was not present during the 

2048
01:36:54,521 --> 01:36:55,354
recording with Jordan Peterson,
but through the miracle of technology 

2049
01:37:00,670 --> 01:37:01,503
and recording,
echo has now joined us for the support 

2050
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:10,540
portion of this podcast.
So good evening echo.

2051
01:37:10,990 --> 01:37:13,000
Good evening.
All right.

2052
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:13,893
So if people listen to this podcast,
which we appreciate and you want to 

2053
01:37:18,611 --> 01:37:21,670
support this podcast and support 
yourself.

2054
01:37:21,950 --> 01:37:24,670
So there are ways to do that.
Echo can fill you in.

2055
01:37:25,150 --> 01:37:25,983
Sure.
So first way is when you're doing 

2056
01:37:29,321 --> 01:37:31,450
jujitsu cause we're all doing Jujitsu.
Yes,

2057
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:36,540
it might sound a little bit repetitive,
but to me when you do this,

2058
01:37:36,541 --> 01:37:37,780
you going to be doing it every single 
day,

2059
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:39,483
every single week at least.
Even if you're doing the two times a 

2060
01:37:41,711 --> 01:37:42,910
week,
three to get it.

2061
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:45,310
Either way you're going to need a g and 
a rash guard,

2062
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:49,990
so there is no question which kind of 
Geeky you get.

2063
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:51,490
You get an origin in gay.
Straight up.

2064
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:52,463
I made an America,
I watched one of their videos yesterday 

2065
01:37:58,410 --> 01:37:59,243
and it was kind of an older one too,
but it made me like love origin even 

2066
01:38:03,481 --> 01:38:04,314
more because it's like you'll see,
you know the people that make 'em and 

2067
01:38:06,891 --> 01:38:07,724
all the ladies there and then Pete,
like he has like longer hair and stuff 

2068
01:38:10,201 --> 01:38:10,831
like that.
It's like,

2069
01:38:10,831 --> 01:38:11,664
Oh man,
this is kind of more the beginnings of 

2070
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:14,520
origin,
you know?

2071
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:16,740
Anyway,
I thought it was good nonetheless.

2072
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:17,693
Again,
made in America quality stuff for 

2073
01:38:20,011 --> 01:38:20,844
Jujitsu.
It's not like a blank gay they get from 

2074
01:38:24,031 --> 01:38:24,864
over wherever,
some other place and them slap an 

2075
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,770
embroidered patch on it and say that,
no,

2076
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:34,770
this is made for Jujitsu in America.
Made in America.

2077
01:38:34,830 --> 01:38:36,900
From where,
where we grow,

2078
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:40,260
the material is grown in America,
woven in America,

2079
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:41,490
woven in Maine.

2080
01:38:41,550 --> 01:38:44,790
As a matter of fact,
custom woven by origin.

2081
01:38:45,130 --> 01:38:48,390
We weave it up there and make the best 
cheese in the world.

2082
01:38:48,391 --> 01:38:50,020
Also got some other stuff for,
you know,

2083
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:50,913
you got t shirts,
you can get sweatshirts and also coming 

2084
01:38:54,931 --> 01:38:59,931
in 2019 jeans,
denim origin denim.

2085
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:03,060
I just call him jeans though.
Yeah.

2086
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:04,200
Yeah,
I dig it.

2087
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:05,940
That starts to like,
I dunno,

2088
01:39:05,970 --> 01:39:09,570
move towards a fashion thing.
What if you seek denim and denim?

2089
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:10,520
Well,
I feel,

2090
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:12,870
yeah,
I didn't feel that material.

2091
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:15,180
Yeah,
I feel like it's like origin denim,

2092
01:39:15,181 --> 01:39:16,240
they make it,
you know?

2093
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:17,340
Yeah.
And then yeah,

2094
01:39:17,341 --> 01:39:18,174
they make origin jeans for sure.
But what if they make like a Jean 

2095
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,410
Jacket?
Like a denim jacket?

2096
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:23,220
No,
it'd be true,

2097
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:25,200
but it's still be a Jean Jacket.
That's true.

2098
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:26,433
Uh,
dig it.

2099
01:39:26,730 --> 01:39:27,660
Cool.
Either way.

2100
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:28,494
Yeah,
that's,

2101
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:32,430
and I don't get excited for jeans in 
general in life.

2102
01:39:32,610 --> 01:39:34,710
Oh yeah.
Like you know,

2103
01:39:34,711 --> 01:39:37,020
you see it on TV.
I don't know.

2104
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:39,860
JC Penny has a sale,
you know,

2105
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:41,850
black Friday or whatever.
And you know,

2106
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:43,560
some jeans,
I don't get excited.

2107
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:45,470
You pry,
I'm assuming you don't need or maybe do,

2108
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:46,313
I dunno.
But when pete posts little like videos 

2109
01:39:50,281 --> 01:39:51,210
of the close,
you know,

2110
01:39:51,211 --> 01:39:54,600
close up of the buttons,
the jeans.

2111
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:55,291
Come on,
Bro.

2112
01:39:55,291 --> 01:39:56,580
That's,
that's kind of exciting.

2113
01:39:56,581 --> 01:39:59,250
I'm just saying either way.
Either way.

2114
01:39:59,251 --> 01:40:00,084
The also,
we have supplements to affirmative 

2115
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:04,920
forigin labs,
which is expanding.

2116
01:40:05,630 --> 01:40:06,650
Yes.
Yeah.

2117
01:40:06,660 --> 01:40:09,510
We bought another building up there,
but yeah,

2118
01:40:09,511 --> 01:40:12,990
so they're making,
we are making supplements,

2119
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:14,460
joint warfare,
Krill oil,

2120
01:40:14,461 --> 01:40:15,840
super oil,
by the way.

2121
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:20,800
Discipline the Tri Fecta.
Yeah.

2122
01:40:21,110 --> 01:40:22,200
Yeah.
The,

2123
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:25,170
my,
my wife went on a trip,

2124
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:28,590
didn't take joint warfare with her.
Yeah.

2125
01:40:29,610 --> 01:40:31,380
She's there for three,
four days.

2126
01:40:31,410 --> 01:40:34,320
Her knee starts bothering her.
It bothers her the rest of the trip.

2127
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,280
She comes home,
she goes back on drone warfare for three

2128
01:40:36,281 --> 01:40:37,360
or four days.
Nice.

2129
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:37,970
Fine.
Again.

2130
01:40:37,970 --> 01:40:38,830
Yeah.
Same.

2131
01:40:40,450 --> 01:40:42,150
Yeah.
That's just a reality of it.

2132
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:43,770
So joint warfare,
good for your joints.

2133
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:44,604
Krill oil,
also good for your joints and good for 

2134
01:40:45,661 --> 01:40:47,730
your,
for your whole life system.

2135
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:50,880
Is that a thing?
Life system life says yes.

2136
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:51,540
Okay.
Well,

2137
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:52,373
yeah,
it's good for that to discipline when 

2138
01:40:54,581 --> 01:40:56,920
you need that focus.
And also discipline go.

2139
01:40:57,300 --> 01:40:58,133
Yeah.
Which is my pre cognitive enhancement 

2140
01:41:03,670 --> 01:41:07,110
tool.
Go to go to check.

2141
01:41:07,590 --> 01:41:08,050
Yeah,
the,

2142
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:08,920
it's funny,
the Krill,

2143
01:41:08,921 --> 01:41:11,660
I had the same situation too by the way.
Krill oil and joint warfare.

2144
01:41:11,710 --> 01:41:15,140
It didn't bring it by the way in Hawaii,
which is the reason why I did,

2145
01:41:15,141 --> 01:41:18,560
didn't appear on this episode of the 
podcast.

2146
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:18,951
So,
you know,

2147
01:41:18,951 --> 01:41:19,784
I saw my father in law came,
I told them the story about how he'd 

2148
01:41:23,441 --> 01:41:24,274
always talk about Krill oil and he's 
just sort of looking at me like 

2149
01:41:26,171 --> 01:41:27,004
whatever.

2150
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:28,630
And um,
you know,

2151
01:41:28,631 --> 01:41:29,710
he used to tell me,
Oh yeah,

2152
01:41:29,711 --> 01:41:31,810
Krill oil is good,
good for you,

2153
01:41:31,811 --> 01:41:32,770
all this stuff.
And he said,

2154
01:41:32,771 --> 01:41:33,760
now listen,
cause you know,

2155
01:41:33,761 --> 01:41:34,594
he's more of like a health dude.
And then when you started talking about 

2156
01:41:38,711 --> 01:41:39,544
it,
like literally the day you start 

2157
01:41:40,571 --> 01:41:41,980
talking,
start taking it.

2158
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:43,960
And he was like,
he didn't care.

2159
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:45,940
It kind of went right over his head and 
he was like,

2160
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,310
oh,
so did you feel the difference?

2161
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:50,590
You know,
like that's what he was concerned about.

2162
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:54,040
What do you mean care respect.
Also on top of that,

2163
01:41:54,041 --> 01:41:56,560
as you got milk,
which is,

2164
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:59,200
which is milk,
basically,

2165
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:01,390
that's what it is.
It's uh,

2166
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:04,600
it has protein in it.
You mix it with milk.

2167
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:06,160
I got her back.
I to make that statement.

2168
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:07,181
If you mix it with,
well,

2169
01:42:07,181 --> 01:42:09,760
you can mix it with almond milk.
You can mix it with coconut milk.

2170
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:14,020
You can mix it with regular cow milk.
If you mix it with water,

2171
01:42:14,710 --> 01:42:18,010
it's not,
I'm not jumping up and down about it and

2172
01:42:18,011 --> 01:42:19,540
telling you it's the most delicious 
thing in the world.

2173
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,240
If you mix it with milk,
whole milk especially,

2174
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:23,460
I will tell you it's,
it's a,

2175
01:42:23,650 --> 01:42:24,483
it's a dessert straight up.
It's a dessert that you will make you 

2176
01:42:27,221 --> 01:42:29,260
stronger.
If so,

2177
01:42:29,261 --> 01:42:30,790
you know,
like hot cocoa.

2178
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:31,930
You ever make hot?
Oh yeah.

2179
01:42:31,990 --> 01:42:35,380
Okay,
so I'm a fan that you can put in water,

2180
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:36,520
right?
What do you put it in?

2181
01:42:36,521 --> 01:42:39,100
Water and milk.
That is not hot cocoa to me.

2182
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:40,390
Okay.
I know what you're talking about.

2183
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:41,253
You get the little,
the little packet that you're supposed 

2184
01:42:42,641 --> 01:42:43,474
to mix with water.
It's got the little crappy marshmallows 

2185
01:42:44,561 --> 01:42:45,011
in it.
Yeah,

2186
01:42:45,011 --> 01:42:46,390
that's not,
that's a nonstarter for me.

2187
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:47,960
Yeah.
So that's kind of the point there.

2188
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,280
They're sort of along the same lines 
where it's like cool,

2189
01:42:51,281 --> 01:42:54,040
do it and it's okay.
You can do it.

2190
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:54,700
Yep.
And,

2191
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:56,230
and there's probably many,
many,

2192
01:42:56,650 --> 01:42:59,290
many people who do that and I'm not mad 
at them.

2193
01:42:59,830 --> 01:43:02,360
But you put the milk,
that stuff and you know,

2194
01:43:02,380 --> 01:43:04,070
that's a good one.
That's my opinion.

2195
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:08,140
You can't have,
you can't have hot chocolate milk.

2196
01:43:09,970 --> 01:43:12,250
It's good.
It's right up there.

2197
01:43:12,450 --> 01:43:13,283
She don't worry.
Your kid won the surrogate mint 

2198
01:43:14,921 --> 01:43:16,120
chocolate peanut butter,
chocolate,

2199
01:43:16,121 --> 01:43:21,121
vanilla gorilla and the darkness.
And then there's the warrior kid mark,

2200
01:43:21,191 --> 01:43:22,024
which has a little bit less protein in 
it unless you double up on your scoops 

2201
01:43:25,090 --> 01:43:25,923
like I do for the strawberry,
cause it's a strawberry is ridiculously 

2202
01:43:28,991 --> 01:43:30,610
good.
So give that a shot.

2203
01:43:30,611 --> 01:43:31,444
And by the way,
all these things are 

2204
01:43:32,621 --> 01:43:37,621
available@originmain.com and that's,
that's the state of Maine.

2205
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:39,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

2206
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:41,950
Not just main,
like the main spot.

2207
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:44,410
Even though it is a main spot check.
Cool.

2208
01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:45,760
Awesome.
Also,

2209
01:43:45,761 --> 01:43:47,410
if you want to represent,
you know,

2210
01:43:47,411 --> 01:43:51,410
get a discipline equals freedom shirt or
a rash guard,

2211
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:52,850
you know,
get after it anyway.

2212
01:43:52,851 --> 01:43:56,240
You want to represent the path,
go to Jocko,

2213
01:43:56,241 --> 01:43:59,060
store.com.
That's where you can get all this stuff.

2214
01:43:59,061 --> 01:43:59,990
Uh,
hoodies,

2215
01:44:00,010 --> 01:44:00,381
you know,
hey,

2216
01:44:00,381 --> 01:44:02,400
Christmas is coming up.
Let's face it.

2217
01:44:03,420 --> 01:44:05,330
There's no avoiding it.
It's coming up,

2218
01:44:05,530 --> 01:44:06,363
you know,
so you want to grab something that's a 

2219
01:44:08,301 --> 01:44:12,290
good place to grab something,
some new stuff on there too.

2220
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:13,513
But yeah,
if you want to represent while on the 

2221
01:44:15,051 --> 01:44:16,070
path,
Jocko,

2222
01:44:16,071 --> 01:44:20,150
store.com good spot.
Also Jocko white tea.

2223
01:44:21,290 --> 01:44:26,090
So these claims of dead lifting,
8,000 pounds,

2224
01:44:26,091 --> 01:44:27,290
I haven't did,
lifted it in awhile.

2225
01:44:27,291 --> 01:44:28,430
So it was like,
you know what I'm gonna do?

2226
01:44:28,431 --> 01:44:30,380
I'm gonna test it.
The cans,

2227
01:44:30,410 --> 01:44:32,300
right tea,
drink it straight up,

2228
01:44:32,301 --> 01:44:32,660
dead,
live,

2229
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:34,130
dead,
lifted 8,000 pounds.

2230
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:35,630
Just like that.
Just like that.

2231
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:37,580
Don't warm up even know you don't need 
it.

2232
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:39,033
It's real.
The warmup is drinking some Jocko white 

2233
01:44:40,641 --> 01:44:41,474
tea.
That is the one you're warmed up and 

2234
01:44:43,281 --> 01:44:44,860
you're good.
8,000 pound deadlift.

2235
01:44:44,861 --> 01:44:45,090
So,
yeah,

2236
01:44:45,090 --> 01:44:45,460
that's,
you know,

2237
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:46,293
this is the only product in the world in
any capacity that guarantees 100% 8,000 

2238
01:44:52,941 --> 01:44:53,990
pound deadlift,
minimum

2239
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,800
100% but yeah.
So yeah,

2240
01:44:57,801 --> 01:45:01,010
you get them wet and the dry tea bags if
that's your thing,

2241
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:03,740
when you see Paul,
that's the word,

2242
01:45:03,810 --> 01:45:04,643
right.

2243
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:08,090
Boom.
If you like that Gig,

2244
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:10,131
hot,
cold,

2245
01:45:10,131 --> 01:45:11,330
whatever.
And then the cans,

2246
01:45:11,331 --> 01:45:12,740
which I recommend,
I recommend,

2247
01:45:12,741 --> 01:45:15,110
they can't actually,
I don't know if I'd recommend it,

2248
01:45:15,111 --> 01:45:17,250
but I prefer that I like them both.
Yeah.

2249
01:45:17,330 --> 01:45:20,210
Depending on the scenario of her boom,
there you go.

2250
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:23,860
Also subscribe to the podcast on itunes 
and stitcher and Google play.

2251
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:26,480
Wherever you listen to podcasts is a lot
of new ones out there.

2252
01:45:27,070 --> 01:45:27,903
There's apps and there's a lot of 
podcasts out there and listened to a 

2253
01:45:31,791 --> 01:45:32,870
bunch of them.
Yeah.

2254
01:45:33,350 --> 01:45:35,960
And one of them that you can also listen
to in addition to this one,

2255
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:39,500
if you want,
you can take out the warrior kid podcast

2256
01:45:40,790 --> 01:45:44,210
that's basically directed at kids.
But um,

2257
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:49,010
I'll tell you that uncle jake has 
lessons for everyone in that podcast.

2258
01:45:49,940 --> 01:45:50,773
And also we've got the youtube channel,
the youtube channel where you can watch 

2259
01:45:52,941 --> 01:45:53,774
this podcast in its full length and you 
can see what people look like if you 

2260
01:45:57,261 --> 01:45:59,570
don't know what Jordan B.
Peterson looks like.

2261
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:00,613
If you don't know what Echo Charles look
like or if you don't know what I look 

2262
01:46:02,541 --> 01:46:03,374
like,
you can watch the youtube channel and 

2263
01:46:05,481 --> 01:46:07,880
you can see all of us.
If you never heard,

2264
01:46:07,910 --> 01:46:10,130
if you've never seen before,
but you've only heard him,

2265
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:14,660
he probably doesn't look like what you 
think he looks like.

2266
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,180
Yeah,
allegedly.

2267
01:46:17,181 --> 01:46:18,590
And I don't know if that's good or bad 
enough.

2268
01:46:18,591 --> 01:46:19,424
That's a backhanded compliment or a 
backhanded like derogatory statement 

2269
01:46:22,821 --> 01:46:24,320
about you,
about your voice?

2270
01:46:24,410 --> 01:46:25,243
Probably both.
Yeah,

2271
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:27,710
a little bit of both but,
but we'll,

2272
01:46:27,711 --> 01:46:29,930
we'll uh,
suffice it to say that he's not what you

2273
01:46:29,931 --> 01:46:30,764
expect when you see him in reality.
And he also makes videos that are 

2274
01:46:36,770 --> 01:46:39,680
enhanced by imagery and music.
Yeah,

2275
01:46:40,490 --> 01:46:43,070
exactly.
And those are on there too,

2276
01:46:43,490 --> 01:46:44,323
so you can check those out.
You can subscribe to the Youtube 

2277
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:46,881
Channel.
Also,

2278
01:46:46,881 --> 01:46:51,750
we got the psychological warfare album 
and that has tracks on it of,

2279
01:46:52,890 --> 01:46:53,723
well there are of me telling you 
pragmatically why you should or should 

2280
01:46:57,121 --> 01:47:01,170
not do something like skip a workout.

2281
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:04,740
You should not skip a workout.
Eat donuts,

2282
01:47:04,770 --> 01:47:07,500
you should not eat donuts.
So just some little things like that.

2283
01:47:07,501 --> 01:47:08,334
You can check that out.
Psychological Warfare Echo claims that 

2284
01:47:10,381 --> 01:47:12,620
it has 100% effectiveness.
Yeah,

2285
01:47:12,621 --> 01:47:15,120
it does.
100% should you go to the gym?

2286
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:17,490
Yes you should.
And if you listen to the track,

2287
01:47:17,820 --> 01:47:19,830
you will go to the gym.
It's 100% effective.

2288
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:20,693
And actually,
I mean a lot of claims being made about 

2289
01:47:22,051 --> 01:47:24,120
effectiveness on this scenario,
right?

2290
01:47:24,410 --> 01:47:25,350
Hey,
it's if it's real,

2291
01:47:25,351 --> 01:47:26,184
it's real.
You know,

2292
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:30,250
there's no double blind placebo tested.
Well you know,

2293
01:47:30,260 --> 01:47:31,810
single blind,
maybe that's,

2294
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:32,853
you know what that means,
but that's not official and it is 

2295
01:47:35,161 --> 01:47:37,470
official when,
okay.

2296
01:47:37,650 --> 01:47:41,760
And I kind of tried to psychologically 
analyze psychological warfare.

2297
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:44,130
Like why does it work every single time?
And he was part of it.

2298
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:45,353
Even you,
you know how like when you get 

2299
01:47:46,531 --> 01:47:48,150
hypnotized,
I'm not saying you should have,

2300
01:47:48,151 --> 01:47:48,984
I should have asked.
I should have asked Jordan this 

2301
01:47:49,771 --> 01:47:51,100
question.
Yes.

2302
01:47:51,110 --> 01:47:52,710
And he did agree with this I think.
Okay,

2303
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:55,380
well let's hear it goes bro Theory.

2304
01:47:57,810 --> 01:48:01,680
So you know,
like I'm being hypnotized for example.

2305
01:48:02,910 --> 01:48:04,290
I've never been hypnotized.
Yeah,

2306
01:48:04,291 --> 01:48:05,730
me neither.
So well,

2307
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:09,140
but then again it happens to,
so have you ever said volunteered?

2308
01:48:09,141 --> 01:48:10,530
Did he admit okay,
me neither.

2309
01:48:10,531 --> 01:48:12,540
Same thing.
So hypnotism,

2310
01:48:12,541 --> 01:48:15,150
from what I understand is you have to 
like be,

2311
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:18,030
what do you call like successful,
open to it.

2312
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:19,380
Open to it.
Yeah.

2313
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:20,453
So if you're suggestible person,
that's like you have a certain kind of 

2314
01:48:24,121 --> 01:48:25,440
mind.
And then on top of that,

2315
01:48:25,470 --> 01:48:28,740
even more consciously,
you have to volunteer to be hypnotized.

2316
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:30,030
A guy.
I mean,

2317
01:48:30,031 --> 01:48:30,864
I'm sure there's methods that you can 
sort of hypnotize someone without them 

2318
01:48:33,331 --> 01:48:35,190
knowing it or something.
But usually,

2319
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:38,960
I shouldn't even say I'm sure,
but,

2320
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:40,690
oh yeah,
that's right.

2321
01:48:40,690 --> 01:48:44,760
So if you can hit a dead zone and they 
or not,

2322
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:49,080
nonetheless,
usually the hypnotic sequence goes from,

2323
01:48:49,081 --> 01:48:51,270
hey,
you volunteer like conscious of,

2324
01:48:51,271 --> 01:48:51,690
yeah,
sure.

2325
01:48:51,690 --> 01:48:52,523
I'll be hypnotizing you sit there and 
your suit coat to 10 and you're closing 

2326
01:48:55,021 --> 01:48:55,854
your eyes and breathing anyway,
so you consciously volunteer to be 

2327
01:48:59,401 --> 01:49:00,234
hypnotized,
so you're open to being hypnotized and 

2328
01:49:01,981 --> 01:49:02,401
then blah,
blah,

2329
01:49:02,401 --> 01:49:04,140
blah.
So psychologic warfare.

2330
01:49:04,230 --> 01:49:04,861
It's like,
Hey,

2331
01:49:04,861 --> 01:49:05,910
you recognize,
okay,

2332
01:49:05,911 --> 01:49:06,744
I have this weakness.
I'm about to skip this workout right 

2333
01:49:07,891 --> 01:49:09,450
now.
You're basically saying,

2334
01:49:09,451 --> 01:49:10,201
hey,
I need to help.

2335
01:49:10,201 --> 01:49:11,940
I need you.
I need a little spa.

2336
01:49:11,970 --> 01:49:13,500
Volunteering for help.
Volunteering.

2337
01:49:13,501 --> 01:49:14,334
Yeah.
It's not like I'm like sitting in my 

2338
01:49:15,691 --> 01:49:17,400
room.
It's not completely against your will.

2339
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:18,600
Exactly.
Right.

2340
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:22,050
You're not just busting in the door,
you know insane.

2341
01:49:22,051 --> 01:49:23,220
Hey,
don't skip the workout.

2342
01:49:23,250 --> 01:49:24,090
Meanwhile,
in your mind,

2343
01:49:24,091 --> 01:49:26,910
you already committed to keeping,
the way it's different is you're like,

2344
01:49:27,150 --> 01:49:28,770
you're not committed to skipping the 
workout.

2345
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:33,180
You just like are running the risk of 
skipping the work.

2346
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:35,940
You know that weakness just creeps in 
and you're like,

2347
01:49:35,941 --> 01:49:36,774
hey,
I see you weakness you're creeping in 

2348
01:49:37,501 --> 01:49:37,800
right now.

2349
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:38,970
I'm going to get,
I'm basically,

2350
01:49:38,971 --> 01:49:42,630
I'm going to tell Jocko that you're in 
here and he's going to,

2351
01:49:42,631 --> 01:49:43,464
you know,
make you leave and you played the track 

2352
01:49:45,391 --> 01:49:46,470
or whatever.
You have it on your phone,

2353
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:47,573
right?
You had,

2354
01:49:47,950 --> 01:49:50,680
you have all your playlist on your phone
anyway.

2355
01:49:50,681 --> 01:49:53,200
You just play the psychological warfare 
one and boom,

2356
01:49:53,230 --> 01:49:54,760
you won't skip the workout.
See what I'm saying?

2357
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:56,440
Cause you don't want to skip the 
workout.

2358
01:49:56,590 --> 01:50:00,070
No one wants to skip to work on.
No one's thinking tomorrow.

2359
01:50:00,071 --> 01:50:02,770
I can't wait to skip this workout.
And that just not like that.

2360
01:50:02,771 --> 01:50:04,340
You know?
So it's,

2361
01:50:04,470 --> 01:50:07,060
you come in and you just give that 
little nudge.

2362
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:09,040
That's why it works so good.
It's true.

2363
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:10,840
It's absolutely true.
I like it.

2364
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:14,080
And then the less psychological warfare,
it's very effective.

2365
01:50:14,090 --> 01:50:14,923
Hundred percent also while you're 
working out and if you're bored with 

2366
01:50:18,611 --> 01:50:23,611
your squats bench,
get some kettlebells from on it,

2367
01:50:27,430 --> 01:50:29,080
in my opinion on it.

2368
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:32,140
Dot Com slash Jocko good stuff on their 
jump rope.

2369
01:50:32,141 --> 01:50:34,210
Battle ropes,
kettlebells,

2370
01:50:34,530 --> 01:50:35,450
clubs,
mic.

2371
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:36,293
Be careful of the clubs because I was 
watching a video of a guy doing this 

2372
01:50:40,211 --> 01:50:43,380
club routine.
I was like Dang it,

2373
01:50:43,450 --> 01:50:45,220
eat.
It took a lot of coordination.

2374
01:50:45,221 --> 01:50:48,850
Like I'm looking at it and he had like 
the 40 I think like a big one.

2375
01:50:48,851 --> 01:50:49,684
Yeah.
I can't even imagine trying to do 

2376
01:50:50,410 --> 01:50:51,243
anything coordinated with the 40 yes.
Cause I only have the 20 yeah and yeah 

2377
01:50:57,180 --> 01:51:01,090
and they come off real a lot more heavy 
than they look like when you grab them.

2378
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:02,850
I mean at the end of the day,
if it's 20 pounds,

2379
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:04,000
20 pounds,
no,

2380
01:51:04,330 --> 01:51:08,530
there's no getting past that physically.
But when you pick it up it's like,

2381
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:12,010
it's like,
you know when you pick up your friend or

2382
01:51:12,011 --> 01:51:15,190
your kid freaking and they weighed 70 
pounds.

2383
01:51:15,370 --> 01:51:17,890
It's like I pick up 70 pounds with one 
hand.

2384
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:18,993
It's no problem when it's a dumbbell 
should pick up your kid when they're 70 

2385
01:51:21,911 --> 01:51:23,770
pieces of one hand can do it.
It's hard.

2386
01:51:24,530 --> 01:51:26,080
Unless that's how these clubs are.
Anyway.

2387
01:51:26,081 --> 01:51:27,220
So watch out for those.
Anyway,

2388
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:28,173
go to [inaudible] dot com slash 
chocolate you can get some really cool 

2389
01:51:30,461 --> 01:51:31,870
stuff on there.
Really cool.

2390
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:32,831
Awesome.
Hey,

2391
01:51:32,831 --> 01:51:35,620
we got some books as well.
First off,

2392
01:51:35,621 --> 01:51:38,080
Mike in the dragons.
I know Jordan and I talked to about it a

2393
01:51:38,081 --> 01:51:41,560
little bit today and it was actually 
sold out for a little bit.

2394
01:51:41,590 --> 01:51:45,640
It is now back in stock and have many,
many,

2395
01:51:45,670 --> 01:51:50,440
many thousands and thousands of copies 
that are inbound that are being printed.

2396
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:55,680
So if you want Mickey and the dragons,
go to Amazon and order it.

2397
01:51:55,870 --> 01:51:57,730
There's a little video on there if you 
want to know what it's about.

2398
01:51:57,731 --> 01:51:59,250
That echo put together and it's,
it's,

2399
01:51:59,730 --> 01:52:00,563
it's a solid video from what I 
understand the like kids like to watch 

2400
01:52:03,821 --> 01:52:04,654
the video.

2401
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:06,860
Oh you get like,
it's like a little mini show.

2402
01:52:06,861 --> 01:52:09,490
It's super fast.
It's two minutes.

2403
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:12,340
Even even my kid,
so we're on,

2404
01:52:12,670 --> 01:52:15,850
I watched the video
send it to me.

2405
01:52:15,851 --> 01:52:20,470
I watched it like 14 times because 
there's a lot of elements in it.

2406
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:25,920
A lot of things going on to my son.
It's like a micro cartoon Kinda.

2407
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:27,880
No,
it's like a micro movie.

2408
01:52:27,970 --> 01:52:28,803
Yeah.
Well it's a cartoon cause there's 

2409
01:52:30,401 --> 01:52:31,810
illustration illustrations.
Yeah.

2410
01:52:32,230 --> 01:52:32,981
But yeah,
it's fun.

2411
01:52:32,981 --> 01:52:34,750
We put on the TV when I was in Hawaii,
you know,

2412
01:52:34,751 --> 01:52:37,610
you have the smart tv in there.
You can put youtube on there and you put

2413
01:52:37,611 --> 01:52:38,444
it on there.
I put on the TV and my kids are all 

2414
01:52:39,341 --> 01:52:41,170
jumping up and down like in the gym.
If I have is,

2415
01:52:41,171 --> 01:52:42,100
you know,
it's two minutes long.

2416
01:52:42,101 --> 01:52:43,470
So No,
I,

2417
01:52:43,910 --> 01:52:44,680
you know,
uh,

2418
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:45,950
Jordan I were talking about it

2419
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:50,510
and you know,
obviously it's about facing your dragons

2420
01:52:50,570 --> 01:52:52,660
and there's obviously a metaphor there 
and it's a,

2421
01:52:52,950 --> 01:52:56,630
there's real,
true pragmatic,

2422
01:52:56,750 --> 01:52:57,583
simple to understand lessons of how to 
stand up and confront the world and 

2423
01:53:01,521 --> 01:53:02,354
confront your fears that little kids 
will clearly and easily understand and 

2424
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:08,060
it'll leave an impact on anybody that 
reads it.

2425
01:53:08,270 --> 01:53:09,103
So Mike and the dragons that you can get
that book on top of that if you've got 

2426
01:53:12,180 --> 01:53:13,013
kids,
you can also get them though the way of 

2427
01:53:13,881 --> 01:53:14,714
the warrior kid,
which is another book about a young kid 

2428
01:53:18,171 --> 01:53:21,740
who's going through the problems that 
normal kids have.

2429
01:53:21,950 --> 01:53:25,910
And luckily his uncle Jake,
who was a seal in the seal teams,

2430
01:53:25,911 --> 01:53:28,680
it shows up for the summer and helps him
overcome those problems.

2431
01:53:28,681 --> 01:53:32,540
And then that series carries on.
And another book called Mark's mission.

2432
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:36,670
You can pick those two books up and give
them to whatever kids you,

2433
01:53:36,690 --> 01:53:37,610
those,
those books.

2434
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:38,443
When you read those books,
you'll wish you had that book when you 

2435
01:53:40,731 --> 01:53:41,720
were a kid.
I know.

2436
01:53:41,721 --> 01:53:42,554
I absolutely wish I had that book when I
was a kid and I wish I had that book 

2437
01:53:45,471 --> 01:53:47,430
when my kids were kids.
Yeah,

2438
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:50,840
because it teaches them what it is they 
need to know.

2439
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:52,130
Period.
That's it.

2440
01:53:52,970 --> 01:53:53,803
Uh,
the discipline equals freedom field 

2441
01:53:54,591 --> 01:53:56,510
manual.
That book,

2442
01:53:57,230 --> 01:53:58,850
that's how you,
that's how you,

2443
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:01,820
it's just a field manual of how to be on
the path of discipline.

2444
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:02,713
That's what it is.
Look at the path of discipline is not 

2445
01:54:04,131 --> 01:54:07,220
easy and there's no field manual for it.
Oh wait,

2446
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:10,040
there is now,
but there didn't use to be there.

2447
01:54:10,041 --> 01:54:10,731
Didn't used to be.
Look,

2448
01:54:10,731 --> 01:54:12,740
I know discipline will help me.
How do I get disciplined?

2449
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:15,500
Where does discipline come from?
There's none of that.

2450
01:54:15,530 --> 01:54:19,640
Information was assembled anywhere.
I made a field manual for it.

2451
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:21,440
It's called the discipline equals 
freedom field manual.

2452
01:54:22,010 --> 01:54:23,960
It's not,
it's,

2453
01:54:23,961 --> 01:54:27,620
it's not like any other book you've ever
seen or read,

2454
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:29,390
period.
It's not,

2455
01:54:29,810 --> 01:54:32,710
but it's very popular.
It's great if you want it.

2456
01:54:32,711 --> 01:54:33,544
This is another thing Chris,
did you get Christmas is coming 

2457
01:54:34,940 --> 01:54:36,890
[inaudible] this is a Christmas 
scenario,

2458
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:38,930
right?
This is a Christmas scenario.

2459
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:43,940
Give this book to somebody that needs 
help or needs to stay on the path or get

2460
01:54:43,941 --> 01:54:44,774
on the path.
This book will be extremely beneficial 

2461
01:54:46,851 --> 01:54:50,150
to them or people that are on the path 
getting after it.

2462
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:53,030
This will keep them there.
So that's the field manual.

2463
01:54:53,031 --> 01:54:55,280
If you want the audio version of that.
It is not an audible,

2464
01:54:55,281 --> 01:54:59,900
it's on itunes and Amazon music and 
Google play as an MP three also,

2465
01:54:59,901 --> 01:55:01,940
the first book I wrote with my brother 
Leif Babin,

2466
01:55:01,941 --> 01:55:02,774
it's called extreme ownership.
That is a book taking the leadership 

2467
01:55:05,811 --> 01:55:09,320
lessons that we learned on the 
battlefield and translating them to your

2468
01:55:09,321 --> 01:55:10,880
business and to your life.

2469
01:55:11,990 --> 01:55:14,870
And then the followup to that book is 
the dichotomy of leadership,

2470
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:15,913
which takes those lessons that we 
learned in combat and goes granular in 

2471
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:22,813
teaching you how to balance the various 
dichotomies that you experience as a 

2472
01:55:25,941 --> 01:55:29,450
leader.
So both in all those books are available

2473
01:55:29,690 --> 01:55:32,150
on Amazon and wherever else you might do
buy books.

2474
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,280
Also we've got to echelon front,
which is uh,

2475
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:38,770
my leadership consultancy.
We solve problems through leadership.

2476
01:55:38,810 --> 01:55:39,643
That's what we do.
And we work with companies all over the 

2477
01:55:41,031 --> 01:55:41,864
country and internationally.
If you want us to come and align the 

2478
01:55:46,891 --> 01:55:47,724
leadership at your company for victory 
and they go to [inaudible] dot com the 

2479
01:55:53,341 --> 01:55:54,174
we are do,
we have a leadership conference called 

2480
01:55:55,590 --> 01:55:56,423
the muster and we've done six musters.
We are doing three and 2019 we're doing 

2481
01:56:03,031 --> 01:56:03,864
one in Chicago in the spring.
We're doing one in Denver in the fall 

2482
01:56:07,561 --> 01:56:11,010
and we're doing Sydney,
Australia in December.

2483
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:14,370
So if you want to come to one of those 
events,

2484
01:56:14,490 --> 01:56:17,520
all the events that we've done have sold
out all of them.

2485
01:56:17,610 --> 01:56:20,430
These are all absolutely going to sell 
out.

2486
01:56:20,790 --> 01:56:25,230
So if you want to come,
go to extreme ownership.com and register

2487
01:56:25,320 --> 01:56:29,220
and as quick as you can.
And then lastly we have f overwatch.

2488
01:56:29,221 --> 01:56:30,054
We are connecting special operations 
veterans and Combat Aviation veterans 

2489
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:36,653
that are looking for work that are 
proven leaders that are experienced 

2490
01:56:41,491 --> 01:56:42,324
leaders and we're connecting them with 
companies out there in the civilian 

2491
01:56:44,131 --> 01:56:44,964
sector that need leaders.
So if you want to come at that from 

2492
01:56:49,111 --> 01:56:51,810
either side,
whether you're a vet or whether you're a

fee ease.

2497
01:57:10,410 --> 01:57:11,243
The bookie echo is adequate.
Charles and I am at jockowillink and I 

2498
01:57:16,651 --> 01:57:20,580
started out this podcast today pretty 
heavy,

2499
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:21,533
pretty rough and I think it's important 
to remember something that I always 

2500
01:57:26,701 --> 01:57:30,570
refer back to and that is that evil does
exist in the world.

2501
01:57:30,780 --> 01:57:33,570
It's out there.
And with that,

2502
01:57:33,571 --> 01:57:34,404
I'd like to thank all the military 
personnel throughout the globe that 

2503
01:57:38,521 --> 01:57:39,354
stand up to evil in the world and thanks
to police and law enforcement and 

2504
01:57:43,411 --> 01:57:44,244
firefighters and paramedics and emt,
ies and correctional officers in border 

2505
01:57:47,131 --> 01:57:52,131
patrol and all the first responders that
stand up and face evil here at home.

2506
01:57:54,390 --> 01:57:56,220
And to everyone else out there,

2507
01:57:58,490 --> 01:57:59,150
okay,

2508
01:57:59,150 --> 01:58:02,600
if things are tough,
and I know they get tough,

2509
01:58:02,870 --> 01:58:07,870
life is hard,
but there's still reason to be thankful.

2510
01:58:09,730 --> 01:58:10,563
Be Thankful you're not in a gulag.
Be Thankful that you're not being 

2511
01:58:15,221 --> 01:58:17,620
tortured.
Be Thankful that you have food to eat.

2512
01:58:17,621 --> 01:58:18,454
Be thankful you have a bed to sleep on
and then do your best to watch out for 

2513
01:58:24,611 --> 01:58:29,611
those little seeds of evil that are 
planted around you,

2514
01:58:31,650 --> 01:58:36,650
implanted in you,
and keep those seeds of evil in check by

2515
01:58:40,051 --> 01:58:45,051
going out into the world and doing good.
And until next time,

2516
01:58:48,070 --> 01:58:49,960
this is echo and Jocko

2517
01:58:51,190 --> 01:58:52,023
out.
