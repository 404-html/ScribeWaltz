1
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:57,210
Ralston College and the Cambridge Center
for the study of platonism,

2
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,463
it's an immense honor to introduce two 
of the foremost intellectuals of our 

3
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:05,610
age.
These thinkers,

4
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,900
wonder,
philosopher,

5
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,103
the other psychologist.
A spiritual writers is addressing the 

6
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:17,511
malaise of the soul in our culture.
John Stuart Mill in his magnificent test

7
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:25,110
say on Coleridge roots of Benton.
Jeremy Benton,

8
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,790
who above all others,
men that have been led to ask themselves

9
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,450
in regards to any ancient or received 
opinion.

10
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,553
Is it true and by Coleridge,
what is the meaning with Coleridge in 

11
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:46,200
contrast to the utility of Benton,
the very fact that any doctrine had been

12
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:47,034
believed by thoughtful men I'd received 
by whole nations and generations of 

13
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,194
mankind was part of the problem to be 
solved was one of the phenomena to be 

14
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:57,894
accounted for.
This I think is true of both Roger 

15
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,970
Scruton and Jordan Peterson,
and I'd like to mention just a couple of

16
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:07,740
points of convergence.

17
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,933
Warmed is an insistence on the 
importance of imagination as conversion 

18
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:15,264
to truth in opposition to a mere fantasy
and the opposition to idolatry ideology 

19
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,373
as well as idolatry,
especially the idolatrous ideology of 

20
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,303
the Post Modern for call derived 
consensus and the urgent return to 

21
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:45,900
questions about truth,
beauty and goodness,

22
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,063
and of course part of this is linked to 
what both perceive as the perilous 

23
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:51,684
position of the modern university.
They both argue with that continuity of 

24
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:57,684
esteem needs to be regained in the 
humanities and the dominant strands of 

25
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:11,251
the humanities are leading to an 
impoverishment of the souls of students.

26
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,380
Narratives both argue are not just 
stories of power,

27
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,790
but these narratives persist because of 
that truth,

28
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,123
so the importance for both Ralston 
college and indeed for the Cambridge 

29
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,280
Center,
for the study of platonism,

30
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,130
of both of these thinkers is their 
insistence upon the relationship between

31
00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:40,760
mythos and logos,
between story and reason,

32
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,003
the insistence upon a hierarchy of 
values and their vision of education as 

33
00:03:48,021 --> 00:03:48,854
conversion to truth.
This conversation will be moderated by 

34
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:58,970
the president of Rolston College,
Steven Blackwood.

35
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,180
Thank you Douglas Fir those inspiring 
and grounding word starting us off,

36
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:20,031
right in relation to the
past that we wished to recover.

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,833
That'd be a start,
I think with a very straightforward but 

38
00:04:26,401 --> 00:04:28,140
perhaps difficult question.
We're,

39
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:28,974
we're,
we're gathered around the theme 

40
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,970
apprehending the transcendent loosely to
gather this conversation.

41
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:44,170
I'd like to begin by asking each of you,
what is the transcendent?

42
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,620
What does it mean for something to be 
transcendent?

43
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,270
Well,
let me start that.

44
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,533
I,
I take a position which I attributed 

45
00:04:55,221 --> 00:04:57,230
also to can't,
that,

46
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:58,064
um,
that we have a very clear negative 

47
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,943
understanding of it.
We were advanced to the edge of our 

48
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:09,611
thinking in so many areas knowing that 
although there's nothing further that we

49
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:11,234
can say that somehow the truth has never
nevertheless not run out of that 

50
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,940
negative view,
I think needs to be

51
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,453
combined with a more positive view,
which tells us that there are other 

52
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,330
ways,
not just,

53
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,570
not maybe not thinking,
but some other way of,

54
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,443
of crossing that boundary and does it,
were landing in the realm of the 

55
00:05:33,981 --> 00:05:34,814
transcendent and knowing it from inside.
I think that this is something that we 

56
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,880
understand very quickly when personal 
relations in that when I,

57
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,073
when I address you,
I know that I'm addressing something 

58
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,060
which addresses me too,
but from a place where I could never be,

59
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,350
I couldn't at myself from those eyes,
um,

60
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,320
and I can't capture the thing that is 
looking at me from those eyes,

61
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,363
but nevertheless there are leaps of the 
imagination which can put me in your 

62
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:12,821
point of view and from that point who I 
can come to understand exactly what I am

63
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,463
but in a completely different way from 
simply the ordinary empirical knowledge 

64
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:20,030
that I have with myself.

65
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,120
And I think that that sort of 
interpersonal understanding,

66
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:28,121
I would say we can adapt to all the 
other aspects of our world,

67
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,630
which is mysterious to us.
A music for instance.

68
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,680
With that,
that's a beginning of.

69
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,960
And I want to return to music a bit,
a bit later,

70
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,913
Jordan.

71
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,753
Well,
I think it's useful as an adjunct to 

72
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:43,810
that.
So,

73
00:06:43,811 --> 00:06:48,811
so,
so roger mentioned that the transcendent

74
00:06:49,811 --> 00:06:53,560
is what we bump up against when we 
realize our ignorance.

75
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,320
And so it's that which transcends our 
ignorance.

76
00:06:56,321 --> 00:07:00,490
And that in itself makes it an 
implacable fact,

77
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,250
unless you believe that you have no 
ignorance,

78
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:07,480
in which case there's no point in 
furthering a discussion with you,

79
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,033
um,
so the transcendent is the fact in so 

80
00:07:10,841 --> 00:07:13,180
far as it's that which transcends our 
ignorance,

81
00:07:13,181 --> 00:07:16,890
but you can also think about it 
technically so and,

82
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,670
and,
and I think we know enough about how the

83
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:19,504
brain works now so that not that we know
much so that useful things can be said 

84
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:24,364
about that
you tend to represent the world in the 

85
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,460
simplest manner that you possibly can,
that works for what you're doing.

86
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,010
And so you don't actually see the world 
you see sufficiently useful,

87
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:42,340
low represent low resolution 
representations of the world.

88
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,073
And if they work then that's fine.
There's no need to adjust them and 

89
00:07:47,351 --> 00:07:49,660
they're relatively easy to remember and 
to manipulate.

90
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,740
But now and then you have a 
misapprehension about someone let's say,

91
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,550
and you have a conversation with them 
and the conversation goes sideways.

92
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,503
And what that means is that the thing 
that you thought you were conversing 

93
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:03,970
with is not the thing that you're 
conversing with.

94
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,910
And that manifests itself in error,
right?

95
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,744
So error is the place where the 
transcendent reveals itself and what is 

96
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,633
actually revealing itself is the reality
that's outside and underneath your 

97
00:08:16,181 --> 00:08:21,181
perceptions and so what you see in the 
world in some sense is a set of animated

98
00:08:21,671 --> 00:08:22,504
cartoons and a lot of that is actually a
consequence of you seeing nothing but 

99
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,214
your memory because your brain is 
organized so that instead of going 

100
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:34,090
through all of the difficulty of having 
to look at the thing and that in itself,

101
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,373
you look at what you assumed to be there
and if you can get away with that so 

102
00:08:38,471 --> 00:08:39,304
much the better,
but the thing in itself is always much 

103
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,910
richer,
richer than your apprehension of it,

104
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,073
which is partly why you make mistakes,
but also partly why you can continue to 

105
00:08:50,441 --> 00:08:51,850
garner wisdom in the world.

106
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,773
There's always more there than meets the
eye and God only knows how much more 

107
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:57,324
there is there than meets the eye.
And you can show this even in the 

108
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:01,734
religious sense to some degree,
because you could say that there's an 

109
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:04,974
element to the transcendent that 
instills people with a sense of 

110
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:11,460
religious significance.
You can do that by immediately,

111
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,160
scientifically,
by feeding people chemicals,

112
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:14,994
for example,
that disrupt the inhibition of 

113
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:20,520
perception by memory.
And then that puts them in a place where

114
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:24,210
the transcendent tends to reveal itself 
sometimes an overwhelming force.

115
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,630
So this is not some fiction that this 
exists.

116
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:28,464
It's the,
what's transcendent is more real than 

117
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:32,790
the reality that you perceive.
Well,

118
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:33,240
let's pick up.

119
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,980
Let's pick up on that because the,
the,

120
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,873
the ancients and medievals had a clear 
sense that it wasn't the world that was 

121
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:41,400
changing.
It was we ourselves,

122
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:45,380
as we make an ascent towards deeper 
truths,

123
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,170
higher forms of the beautiful,
uh,

124
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,520
as we ourselves become more self 
conscious.

125
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,270
So it's not the world that's changing.
Uh,

126
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,600
but,
but us,

127
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,780
I'm wondering if you could say how you 
understand the nature of that ascent,

128
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,611
that,
that,

129
00:10:00,611 --> 00:10:01,170
that,
that,

130
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,480
that movement and what brings it about.

131
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,860
Uh,
I would

132
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,320
be a bit wary of the metaphor of ascent,
you know,

133
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:11,790
uh,
I,

134
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,250
I think in Plato is quite clear what he 
meant.

135
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,623
He wanted us to actually to transcend 
our earthly perceptions in the way of 

136
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:23,800
seeing things and look on the world from
a,

137
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,320
from a God's eye perspective.
Um,

138
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,340
and this could be done if we enter the 
world of the pure forms,

139
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,600
uh,
and so on,

140
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:35,470
leave empirical reality behind.
I think actually

141
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,050
insofar as the experience of the 
transcendent that I,

142
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,880
as I understand it,
is available to us modern people.

143
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:48,220
It's not that way that we get it perhaps
about some Jordan might be right.

144
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,591
That,
that,

145
00:10:48,591 --> 00:10:49,424
that there are these drug induced 
experiences where things open up to us 

146
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,320
because old barriers of suddenly swept 
away.

147
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,620
But in my own case,
it is the concentration on the empirical

148
00:11:02,381 --> 00:11:06,170
reality,
which at a certain point flips from mere

149
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,743
sensory understanding,
took to a vision in that of it's 

150
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,083
communicating something to me,
and I think this is what the literature 

151
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:20,911
and art and music to,
at their best they read,

152
00:11:21,221 --> 00:11:26,221
described reality so that it is actually
communicating something to you.

153
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,400
It's not just there as an inert object 
before you,

154
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,443
uh,
and that sense of the transcendence is 

155
00:11:33,911 --> 00:11:38,911
like discovering yourself in the mirror 
I'm seeing in the world as a whole,

156
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,960
that thing in you that you could never 
identify in words,

157
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,480
you know,
the subject which is looking at it.

158
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,870
I'm a,
and it's not a mystery mystery,

159
00:11:49,871 --> 00:11:53,140
but it's something that you can then 
explain the difference.

160
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,570
A good writer and a bad writer,
of course,

161
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,703
it's such a good writer will describe 
something in such a way that the thing 

162
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:02,920
described has the soul of the reader in 
it.

163
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,560
Um,
so,

164
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,453
so that might be a distinction in part 
between the thing and the meaningful 

165
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,390
thing.
Right?

166
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:12,360
And that's a,
that's a very mysterious phenomenon.

167
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,413
In fact,
in some sense that the essence of 

168
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:15,894
phenomenon,
because that means to shine forth is 

169
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,060
we're surrounded by empirical facts.
They're everywhere.

170
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,460
There's more of them than we can 
possibly count,

171
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,300
but some of them do emerge and manifest 
themselves as that,

172
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,390
as that conjunction between the factual 
and the meaningful,

173
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,110
and then that's what's gripping and if 
you're fortunate.

174
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,870
I mean,
to me that's also partly what what leads

175
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:37,704
us onward.
Maybe in something approximating the 

176
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:41,064
asset that you described is that the set
of facts manifests itself as implicitly 

177
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,164
meaningful and that means in some sense 
that there is a call to you that he 

178
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:51,210
hasn't from within you.
I mean,

179
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,133
I don't know how else to put it exactly 
because you walk into a bookstore and a 

180
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:58,230
book will will,
will reveal itself to you.

181
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,623
You know,
or or you have a conversation and part 

182
00:13:01,351 --> 00:13:02,184
of the conversation will trigger 
something in you or you're reading a 

183
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:05,514
scientific paper and much of it's dull 
and then all of a sudden there's 

184
00:13:07,651 --> 00:13:08,484
something that sparks outward that's 
like a port that's a portal into the 

185
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:12,234
transcendent.
And that is a place where the fact and 

186
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:14,604
the meaning converge,
and that's a phenomenon we don't 

187
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,423
understand very well.
It has something to do with its 

188
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,110
convergence,
with the narrative that drives us,

189
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,580
whatever that happens to be.

190
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:24,883
Yeah.
That's so good way of putting into 

191
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,404
actually it connects with the general 
problem of what the humanities are in 

192
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:35,540
the university.
But I've,

193
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,030
I've always assumed that in some way or 
another,

194
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:41,580
if you're teaching literature or 
musicology or,

195
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,673
or history of art or anything,
you are opening young people to those 

196
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:47,114
moments when the world ceases to be a 
mirror accumulation of facts and as it 

197
00:13:53,151 --> 00:13:55,650
were,
addresses you and um,

198
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,623
that requires literary criticism.
It requires opening yourself to 

199
00:14:00,621 --> 00:14:02,010
experience in a way that,
um,

200
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,380
it requires serious education of a,
of a special kind.

201
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,430
And I think that if we thought that the 
humanities as directed towards that,

202
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:15,610
we can see why they might be one way to 
fill the moral void that,

203
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,010
that grows so easily in people's lives.

204
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,960
So young had this idea,
which I really love.

205
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,420
It's a very sophisticated idea.
Um,

206
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,543
it's,
it's,

207
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,200
it's this idea of how the self,
first of all,

208
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:32,040
so the self for young,
this Christ was a symbol of the self.

209
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,940
So the logos was a symbol of the self.
So that's sort of what would you say?

210
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:36,774
It's the divine essence of humanity and 
the image of that is a symbol of the 

211
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:40,914
self and for young the self was the 
totality of the individual across time 

212
00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:49,890
and space.
So it's whatever you are as,

213
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,790
as a transcendent object.
That's a good way of thinking about it.

214
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,253
And then can imagine that that 
transcended object also has to interact 

215
00:14:57,171 --> 00:15:02,171
with you and the world moment by moment.
And his belief was that those times when

216
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:07,100
that space of meaning opened up,
so there is that convergence between the

217
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:07,934
fact and the gripping of the fact was 
the manifestation of the self which is 

218
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:17,420
this transcendent object in this 
specific moment of time and space.

219
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,433
And therefore our call forward to move 
towards revealing that totality as much 

220
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,540
as it can be revealed.
And so it would be partly and that would

221
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,440
be partly revealed by then following a 
meaningful pathway.

222
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,423
And it would be the case that if you're 
engaged in the teaching of humanities 

223
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:35,903
and literature,
that you are trying to engage exactly 

224
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:41,360
that part of the person.
It's to pull them into the story and to,

225
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,150
and have that open up to them.
And then that's a portal.

226
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,370
It's not,
it's not words on paper,

227
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:48,020
it's a,
it's a portal to their,

228
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,330
to their further development towards 
this,

229
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,343
this,
the manifestation of this higher and 

230
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,520
more transcendent motive being

231
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,360
the Hindu idea for the transition from 
the to Brahman,

232
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,980
isn't it,
that you've suddenly pass through a,

233
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,103
uh,
a barrier that can't actually be 

234
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:12,130
described because you can only know it 
when you're on the other side of it.

235
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,353
But when you're on the other side of it,
you looking back at the thing that 

236
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:19,390
you've left and seeing it in as it were 
for the first time.

237
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,553
And knowing what it means.
I guess that's a little connects a 

238
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,970
little bit with what Douglas was saying 
about,

239
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:25,923
about courage.
That courage was an advocate of a form 

240
00:16:31,931 --> 00:16:32,764
of education,
a form of knowledge which shows the 

241
00:16:35,051 --> 00:16:35,884
meaning of things as opposed to the mere
facts accumulated by Bentham and people 

242
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:41,314
like that.
Both of you have done quite deep dives 

243
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:44,674
into 20th century totalitarian 
ideologies at both of you have been a 

244
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:56,370
very trenchant critics of the etiology,
the various forms of nihilism in,

245
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,620
uh,
in our own culture.

246
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,170
Um,
but I think all of us tire of,

247
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,750
of,
uh,

248
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:09,430
I kind of negativity that has come to be
very prevalent in our culture,

249
00:17:11,411 --> 00:17:15,490
not simply the nihilism,
but then we can criticize the nihilism.

250
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:17,380
We ought to criticize it.
Both of you have been,

251
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,900
had been brilliant critics of it.
Um,

252
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,183
but I,
what I take to be at work in both of 

253
00:17:22,451 --> 00:17:23,284
your,
uh,

254
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:26,740
in,
in the work that both of you do is,

255
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,780
is not fundamentally criticism but a 
turn towards something positive,

256
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,840
a recovery of a sense of the 
transcendent.

257
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,973
I'd like to have a,
have a turn for a moment to what does 

258
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:43,870
that recovery look like?
Where do we start?

259
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,543
Well,
if we're thinking intellectually world 

260
00:17:48,341 --> 00:17:50,550
of scholarship and education

261
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,580
that we both belonged to,
has turned,

262
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:56,130
as you say,
in this negative direction,

263
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,480
always preferring debunking explanations
of everything,

264
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,480
show reducing them to the lowest motive,
uh,

265
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:06,300
that,
that it's not truth,

266
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:09,510
but par that we pursue in all that food 
codian nonsense.

267
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:10,743
And I think the only response to that is
to come up with bunking explanations of 

268
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:15,414
so to speak.
Try to put back into the subject matter 

269
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:23,450
of one's own inherent belief in it,
and to recognize that,

270
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:24,284
uh,
you know,

271
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,733
we're not around on this earth for very 
long and we do have an obligation to 

272
00:18:30,361 --> 00:18:33,120
find the things that we love and not the
things that,

273
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:36,730
that we reject a under those things that
we love the view,

274
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,860
the best way towards them is to look at 
the things that other people have loved.

275
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,813
That's what a culture is.
It's the residue of all the things that 

276
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:44,934
people thought were worthwhile to 
preserve and teaching that will will 

277
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:50,820
again reconnect us to what matters.

278
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,710
Well.
And there's,

279
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,720
there's also ways of,
of,

280
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:00,110
of providing a pathway forward by making
the food.

281
00:19:00,411 --> 00:19:02,580
Kalia and arguments,
let's say about power,

282
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,870
more high resolution and one of the 
things that I do in my lectures,

283
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,903
public lectures that I think is rather 
comical is to take and poke fun in some 

284
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:14,604
sense about the idea of power as the 
fundamental foundation for the 

285
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:20,040
hierarchal structures of the West.
I think,

286
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,730
well you can think of the West as one 
large scale,

287
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:26,310
low resolution,
totalitarian tyranny,

288
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,353
the tyranny of the patriarchy.
Or you can decompose that and which in 

289
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:33,780
some senses to transcend the concept.
And I think,

290
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:34,770
well,
I,

291
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,623
I asked my audiences what they think 
about the tyranny of plumbers or the 

292
00:19:40,141 --> 00:19:42,240
tyranny of massage therapists.
Well,

293
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,163
because it,
it,

294
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,700
it's,
it's dead relevant.

295
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:45,534
It's like,
let's say you need a plumber and you do 

296
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,260
need a plumber.

297
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,093
Everyone agrees that you need a plumber 
and because there's hell to pay 

298
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:54,450
otherwise.
And so,

299
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,130
and then the question is,
well,

300
00:19:56,131 --> 00:19:58,290
how is it that you go about selecting a 
plumber?

301
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:03,330
And the answer isn't that there are 
roving bands of tyrannical plumbers that

302
00:20:03,331 --> 00:20:08,331
go door to door telling housewives that 
if they don't use their services,

303
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:12,150
the surface of the most tyrannical 
plumber,

304
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,163
that they'll be mafia like consequences.
What happens instead is that you look 

305
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:22,680
for the plumber who is most able in your
estimation and in the,

306
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,840
in the,
uh,

307
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,013
in his reputation as distributed through
the community for being able to fix 

308
00:20:28,171 --> 00:20:33,171
pipes and run a business and engage in 
an honest transaction with you.

309
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,450
And that's competence.
That's not power.

310
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,523
You see,
what I see as most corrosive about the 

311
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:40,254
postmodern types,
especially those who've derived 

312
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:46,710
themselves from let's say,
is that the idea that every hierarchy or

313
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:49,480
the hierarchy as such is predicated on 
power,

314
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:53,170
is actually an assault on the idea of 
competence itself.

315
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,123
And that in turn is an assault on the 
idea that there are real problems that 

316
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:57,634
can actually be solved.
Well then if you dispense with all that 

317
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,420
and it's only power,
there is no real problems to be solved.

318
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,433
And there's no noble ways of solving 
them even even as in even in as 

319
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:10,534
concrete,
a manner as a good plumber would solve 

320
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,750
that which is a not,
not a trivial thing.

321
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,913
And so then you deprive people of you 
deprive people of that have that sense 

322
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:22,750
of purpose in their life.
Even even at the high resolution levels.

323
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,933
You know,
and I've insisted in my lectures that 

324
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,723
you know,
if you're the sort of person who runs a 

325
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:29,764
small diner,
that it's incumbent on you to run the 

326
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:33,874
highest quality small diner that you 
possibly can because what you're doing 

327
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:41,140
there is not merely providing people 
with basic nutrition.

328
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:46,770
There's way more to the space than meets
the eye and your noble.

329
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:48,963
What would you say?
Acceptance of your limited 

330
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:54,370
responsibility is also simultaneously a 
way to transcend that.

331
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,710
And that can be a place where the 
neighborhood meets.

332
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,693
That can be a place where tired people 
revivify themselves before they go off 

333
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:03,910
to do their difficult work.
That can be a place where you can mentor

334
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:05,980
your employees and help them develop 
their life.

335
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:09,790
Like it's a rich.
It's an unbelievably rich microcosm.

336
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:10,863
And to take on the,
the care and tending of that microcosm 

337
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:16,984
as a responsibility is also a great 
pathway to meaning and unnecessary and 

338
00:22:21,161 --> 00:22:23,690
meaning is something that's,
well not EPA,

339
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,563
phenomenal and not dispensable,
but absolutely central to human 

340
00:22:28,751 --> 00:22:29,584
thriving.
And in the psychological and practical 

341
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:31,804
sense.

342
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,880
Yeah.
But we do have to try and understand why

343
00:22:34,881 --> 00:22:39,530
it is that there is such a charm in the 
food codian position.

344
00:22:39,531 --> 00:22:43,460
Why is it that people want to believe 
that all the best things.

345
00:22:43,461 --> 00:22:44,294
What we think of the best things in 
human relations simply disguised forms 

346
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:49,700
of manipulation.
You know,

347
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,534
that uh,
the,

348
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,720
the whole feminist view of the 
relationship between men and women,

349
00:22:53,721 --> 00:22:54,554
for instance,
switcher is founded on this deep myth 

350
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,753
that men are exercising exercise power 
as a agenda to use the fashionable 

351
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,800
world,
the word over over women.

352
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:12,040
And that all study of this is just a way
of revealing the power and the,

353
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,203
uh,
and the competitor is through which it 

354
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:18,110
flows.
You know,

355
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:22,740
I think there's a,
a will to believe this and why is,

356
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,240
is one of the big questions that I think
we try,

357
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,143
we have to try to understand is it that 
when people lose some kind of 

358
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,800
transcendental religious faith that they
are automatically fall into this pit of,

359
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,480
of resentment as a of the Nietzschean 
unkind to try and find a,

360
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,893
the,
the oppressor in every relationship or 

361
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,160
is there a,
are there truths and exploring as well?

362
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:54,460
Is there other forms of power or forms 
of human relation that looked like power

363
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,993
from one aspect but perhaps also looked 
like tenderness and dependence from 

364
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:00,794
another aspect and that they've just are
emphasizing one half of it or something 

365
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:05,354
like that.
I think there are real questions as to 

366
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:10,550
how it is our culture has got into this 
position.

367
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,211
Yeah.
Yeah.

368
00:24:11,211 --> 00:24:13,820
Well that's the question below the claim
of power.

369
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:15,080
And so I mean,
I've,

370
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:18,980
I've thought about that to some degree 
and here's three possibilities.

371
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,520
I mean,
one is the accusation that all there is,

372
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:25,810
is power is the justification for use of
power of cool.

373
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,320
That's,
that's handy.

374
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:32,420
If that's what you want to use,
so then then there's another problem and

375
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:33,254
that goes along with the failure,
the willful failure to distinguish 

376
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:39,110
competence from tyranny and power,
let's say,

377
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:42,050
because we might think of power as 
unearned authority,

378
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:42,884
something like that because we need a 
definition of power and I think that 

379
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,070
there's a resentment at work there 
that's very,

380
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,270
very deep.
I think it's,

381
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:55,340
it's deep in the biblical sense which is
that there is a proclivity for those who

382
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:57,704
do not manifest what they could manifest
in the world and thereby fail to watch 

383
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:03,734
the success of those who do manifest 
what they could manifest in the world 

384
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:11,180
and succeed and become embittered by 
that tremendously embittered and then to

385
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:16,130
label that as power and then to attempt 
to destroy it because it's simpler to do

386
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:16,964
that than to do the radical internal 
retooling that would be required to set 

387
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:22,280
things straight internally.

388
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,130
I'm sure that

389
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:23,790
that's right.
Uh,

390
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,300
that,
that,

391
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:29,010
that's one explanation of why people are
always tempted by the zero sum vision of

392
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,160
relations.
He's benefit is my cost sort of thing.

393
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,650
Yeah.

394
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,070
Oh,
I wanted to pick up on that the,

395
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,933
the,
the,

396
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,590
the very widespread view that things are
zero sum,

397
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,270
which is of course the,
the,

398
00:25:42,271 --> 00:25:45,570
the language of power.
What's the antidote to that?

399
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,940
What is the,
how does one overturn the,

400
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,160
uh,
the ideology of power?

401
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,960
How does one transcend that with a non 
zero sum a truth or approach to life?

402
00:25:59,250 --> 00:25:59,670
I

403
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,503
personally would say that the first 
thing to recognize is that there are 

404
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,100
positive sum games.
You know,

405
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,300
that's what the real theory of the 
market tells us,

406
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:14,340
that there are whole realms of human 
transactions where both parties gain,

407
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,613
uh,
from,

408
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,910
from the shed,
uh,

409
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,100
engagement.
Uh,

410
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:21,610
and um,
though that doesn't work,

411
00:26:21,611 --> 00:26:25,980
drive away,
the real source of this is difficulty.

412
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,853
Um,
it has something to do with what Jordan 

413
00:26:28,531 --> 00:26:31,960
was referring to and you know,
that people's,

414
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,203
people's resentment at the success of 
others when they cannot match it or 

415
00:26:36,841 --> 00:26:40,260
cannot easily match it will or will not 
match it,

416
00:26:40,261 --> 00:26:41,094
which is either.
Yes,

417
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,270
yes,
exactly.

418
00:26:42,271 --> 00:26:44,640
Uh,
and of the Labor of,

419
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,773
of re reconceived and your own position 
in such that you actually have to do 

420
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:51,810
something about it.
You know,

421
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:53,340
that it's,
there is some,

422
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,370
something lazy about the zero sum 
ambition,

423
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,940
uh,
but uh,

424
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,033
it's not,
uh,

425
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,590
you know,
it's not a vision that successful people

426
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:03,060
have,
you know,

427
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:08,060
and that they have at any level of 
reality and you can actually combat that

428
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,760
to some degree by make it high 
resolution again by,

429
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,833
by making examples.
It's like because very few people 

430
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:15,883
actually believe once they observe that 
all the relationships they've had with 

431
00:27:21,171 --> 00:27:22,004
other people have been zero sum.
Now you might get some very 

432
00:27:24,891 --> 00:27:25,724
disadvantaged people and these people do
exist who've been taken advantage by 

433
00:27:30,621 --> 00:27:31,454
virtually everyone they've ever 
encountered in their whole life like 

434
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,484
that does happen.
But most of the time all you have to do 

435
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:37,790
is remind people.
It's like,

436
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,260
well,
think of someone that you loved.

437
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,590
Even briefly think of a friend that 
you've had.

438
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,633
It's like,
well,

439
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,623
you,
you successfully negotiated with that 

440
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:47,384
friend to do things together because 
otherwise it's not a friendship and it 

441
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:52,723
has to be successful negotiation,
which means your friend has to be happy 

442
00:27:55,851 --> 00:27:57,950
with what you were doing and you have to
be happy.

443
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,053
And so,
and then wasn't it the case that you 

444
00:28:00,531 --> 00:28:01,364
were both happier doing that than either
of you would have been doing something 

445
00:28:04,011 --> 00:28:04,844
else alone and,
and isn't that evidence in your own 

446
00:28:07,341 --> 00:28:08,174
action and your life for the existence 
of non zero sum games and they're 

447
00:28:11,151 --> 00:28:11,984
dependent on successful negotiation is 
we can both have more than we would 

448
00:28:15,591 --> 00:28:16,424
otherwise have if we can come to a 
consensus about what will both pursue 

449
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:23,330
and it's very few people when you make 
it personal like that.

450
00:28:23,331 --> 00:28:24,290
And,
and high resolution.

451
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:25,124
Again,
it's very few people who are willing to 

452
00:28:26,391 --> 00:28:27,224
pursue their ideology of zero sum of a 
zero sum reality so far down that 

453
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:33,074
they'll actually use that to 
characterize their most intimate 

454
00:28:34,941 --> 00:28:35,774
relationships.
Now I would say that someone who does 

455
00:28:37,881 --> 00:28:38,714
that by temperament is literally 
psychopathic because the psychopathic 

456
00:28:43,341 --> 00:28:46,400
view of the world is absolutely that.
It's a zero sum game.

457
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,460
Yes,
I think that's right.

458
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,060
But of course we have a whole body of 
literature,

459
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,760
um,
about sexuality,

460
00:28:54,761 --> 00:28:55,594
which is trying to establish that the 
sexuality is the exercise of power of 

461
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:00,334
one person over another.
You get it already in south was being 

462
00:29:03,431 --> 00:29:08,431
and nothingness where he almost is 
almost by logic that,

463
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,383
that a serious sexual desire for him 
ends up as sadomasochism because you 

464
00:29:16,061 --> 00:29:19,330
cannot extract from the other that gift 
of his freedom,

465
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:20,470
uh,
which,

466
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,110
which is what you're looking for because
his freedom,

467
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:23,710
his,
his,

468
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,543
uh,
not to be obtained by you and therefore 

469
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:27,364
you can only do this by who sort of 
tearing that his flesh and getting him 

470
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:33,760
to confess in the extremes of agony,
but he can't do it.

471
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,350
You know,
this kind of thing.

472
00:29:35,351 --> 00:29:39,100
I know that's a very good vision of what
sexual relations are,

473
00:29:39,101 --> 00:29:42,000
but you get a that image used

474
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,843
by Simone de Beauvoir and all kinds of 
feminists to essentially to de 

475
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:52,291
legitimize the idea that there is such a
thing as love for the other sex.

476
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,070
Well,
there's,

477
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:53,903
there's a,
I think it also masks and more 

478
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:57,760
fundamental problem that's really a 
biological problem.

479
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,640
Like it's a misapprehension of a genuine
problem.

480
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:06,090
But part of what sex does is temporarily
subordinate the individual to nature and

481
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,550
the species.
And so there is a domination there,

482
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,080
you know?
And,

483
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,230
and if,
if a,

484
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:15,760
if a woman decides to have a child,
then she is going to undergo a series of

485
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:16,594
extraordinarily radical transformations 
and she's also going to end up in this 

486
00:30:19,171 --> 00:30:20,004
situation where in all likelihood 
something else becomes fundamentally 

487
00:30:23,261 --> 00:30:25,540
more important than her and there.
So there is a,

488
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,030
there is a sub,
it might be voluntary,

489
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:30,640
subjugation,
subjugation to nature,

490
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,773
and,
and that's built into the fabric of 

491
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:33,760
existence.

492
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,140
And I think it's very easy not to want 
to grapple with that because it's such a

493
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:38,974
profound problem.
And then to make that a secondary 

494
00:30:41,411 --> 00:30:43,480
consequence of something like unbalanced
power,

495
00:30:43,481 --> 00:30:44,314
relationships between the genders,
but of course a traditional religion 

496
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,160
offers you selves for this,
the rites of passage in which,

497
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,003
which joins men to women,
the right of passage which makes birth 

498
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,890
unexperienced with the whole community 
and death.

499
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,310
Likewise,
uh,

500
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,420
and um,
you know,

501
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:08,580
the sense also in these great events,
one is occupying a position in the,

502
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:16,330
in a moral space that has been occupied 
by generations before one.

503
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,253
And so on.
This normalizing of these huge 

504
00:31:19,721 --> 00:31:20,554
transitions I think is something that 
that we have is depended upon religion 

505
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:25,264
to provide this a sacred and having 
taken that away well or ignored it or 

506
00:31:30,341 --> 00:31:31,174
trying to live without a exactly,
without the idea of a sacrament and 

507
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,360
we're actually at a loss when these 
great transitions occur.

508
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,023
Just because it is the case.
In fact that to to engage in the 

509
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:45,874
integration of sexuality with your 
individual life is a series of 

510
00:31:48,971 --> 00:31:50,950
sacrifices.
So for example,

511
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:51,784
if you get married,
that's a sacrifice because it's a 

512
00:31:53,201 --> 00:31:57,940
sacrifice of all other people and so 
it's a sacrifice of that possibility and

513
00:31:57,941 --> 00:31:58,774
then to have a child is the sacrifice of
all the things that you could have done 

514
00:32:01,691 --> 00:32:05,870
otherwise.
Then having that child and two but two,

515
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,900
two,
as you pointed out,

516
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:10,480
to make that part of a broader tradition
to say that,

517
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,650
well that is a sacrifice and there is a 
loss that goes along with that.

518
00:32:14,651 --> 00:32:15,484
But what you gain as a consequences of 
if immeasurables significance in 

519
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:20,704
contrast to the loss.
And one of the things that's really 

520
00:32:22,601 --> 00:32:24,760
struck me in this lecture to her that 
I've been doing,

521
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:25,594
so I've been in about 100 cities and one
of the things that I've been talking to 

522
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:29,794
people about is his meaning and I 
suppose it's meaning in relationship to 

523
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:33,574
the transcendent and the necessity of 
meaning as an antidote to suffering and 

524
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,433
malevolence.

525
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,393
And the hypothesis is something like,
well meaning is to be found in 

526
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:44,770
responsibility.
And this is a,

527
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,643
it's a revelation to people because they
haven't conceptualized it that way 

528
00:32:48,441 --> 00:32:51,020
before.
It's like meaning isn't,

529
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,103
um,
it isn't happiness and it isn't self 

530
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:55,970
esteem.
And it isn't momentary pleasure,

531
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,320
isn't any of that.
It's,

532
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,273
it's the,
it's the bearing of a sacrificial 

533
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:00,974
burden.
And that that actually works to enrich 

534
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:03,674
and ennoble your life in ways that make 
the tragic element of it tolerable and 

535
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:11,330
had to keep you from bitterness.
And so these things that are put forward

536
00:33:11,331 --> 00:33:14,990
as subjugation,
like the subjugation of women to the,

537
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,090
to the catastrophe of birth,
let's say,

538
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:19,010
or even the,
the indignity of,

539
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:19,883
of Patriarchal Union is all of a sudden 
something that you can take on as an 

540
00:33:22,911 --> 00:33:26,960
aspirational goal rather than something 
that's a mere imposition on your,

541
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:27,853
on your moment to moment freedom as a 
relief to people to hear that and to 

542
00:33:30,861 --> 00:33:31,630
know it.

543
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:32,520
Of course.
No,

544
00:33:32,521 --> 00:33:33,354
I agree with that.
But there is also the sense that in the 

545
00:33:38,021 --> 00:33:38,854
world in which we live,
where obviously people have been 

546
00:33:41,471 --> 00:33:44,400
detached to a greater extent from the,
uh,

547
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:48,620
any continuous religious tradition,
there still is a sense of loss.

548
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,290
A people,
uh,

549
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:53,230
they don't.
They know that they're missing something

550
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:57,430
but don't know quite how to identify it.
And that's one reason for thinking,

551
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,890
for them,
thinking that it's been taken away.

552
00:33:59,891 --> 00:34:00,724
Something's been stolen from them and 
they look around at the people who are 

553
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:06,450
at ease in the world,
unsuccessful and seem to be a,

554
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,723
I'm on good terms with themselves and 
think of them as the ones who done the 

555
00:34:11,831 --> 00:34:13,070
stealing.
Uh,

556
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:16,040
and that is a dangerous attitude and I 
think it's,

557
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:16,874
well,
it surely that is part of what he rubs 

558
00:34:18,671 --> 00:34:23,671
in all these
strange academic disciplines like gender

559
00:34:23,681 --> 00:34:25,840
studies,
which simply have as their goal,

560
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,853
the undermining of the existing order 
without anything positive to put in its 

561
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:33,240
place.
And I don't know what those,

562
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,280
those academic studies recruit people 
all the time from this fund of,

563
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,770
uh,
of a,

564
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,073
of isolation as the sense your sense of,
of loss without an ability to identify 

565
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:47,434
the thing that's

566
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:50,640
last as the cold lake element of them 
because they do,

567
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,653
I would say to some degree,
degree prey on people whose 

568
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,610
interpersonal relationships have been 
irreparably damaged.

569
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,680
I have a hypothesis about,
about the feminist end of the postmodern

570
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,840
radical leftist movement.
So,

571
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,830
and this is something I've talked about 
much in public but,

572
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:07,831
but.
Well,

573
00:35:07,831 --> 00:35:10,530
but here goes,
this should get me in lots of trouble.

574
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,390
So,
so,

575
00:35:12,391 --> 00:35:13,950
and,
and there's a variety of things that are

576
00:35:13,951 --> 00:35:14,784
tangled together here.
So we don't know how female biology 

577
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:22,170
would manifest itself politically.
Male biology does.

578
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,183
Female biology is going to.
And that's because female political 

579
00:35:26,431 --> 00:35:30,630
activity on the largest possible scale 
is a relatively new phenomenon.

580
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,010
So,
so,

581
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:36,900
and it isn't obviously the case that men
and women's views of the world are going

582
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:38,130
to.
Precisely.

583
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,113
So here's a hypothesis.
You're telling me what you think about 

584
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:41,724
this.
So one thing that a woman really wants 

585
00:35:45,481 --> 00:35:46,314
to know about a man,
or perhaps you might say one thing that 

586
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:55,230
femininity wants to know about 
masculinity is that it's not a predatory

587
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:56,064
tyrant.

588
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:57,361
Okay?
So,

589
00:35:57,361 --> 00:35:58,740
and here's why.
I mean,

590
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:02,760
first of all,
there's fragility and feminine sexuality

591
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:03,983
to a greater degree than there is an 
male sexuality because women bear a 

592
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,740
higher price for sexual misadventure,
let's say,

593
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:14,760
and are perhaps more prone to 
exploitation by force.

594
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,163
But more than that,
part of being a woman is having the 

595
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:20,334
possibility of bringing something 
extraordinarily fragile and vulnerable 

596
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:27,330
and valuable into the world.
And the first concern might be,

597
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,680
are you a predator?
Fundamentally,

598
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,760
are you a predator?
And so what I see happening in the,

599
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,170
in the feminist disciplines like gender 
studies,

600
00:36:37,171 --> 00:36:39,420
is the politicization of that 
accusation.

601
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,523
And the accusation is prove to me that 
you're not a Predator like in in your 

602
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:46,104
fund,
in the fundamental element of your 

603
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,220
masculinity,
not only historically but now,

604
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,460
because the cost of you being a Predator
is,

605
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:56,970
is too high.
Now I feel that that's an inappropriate.

606
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,330
I think that's what's driving the 
demolition of the idea of presumption of

607
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:01,440
innocence.
For example,

608
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,573
we'll start with presumption of guilt 
and prove to you will be proved to me 

609
00:37:05,821 --> 00:37:06,654
that you're innocent.
And I think the problem with that isn't 

610
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,830
that there are no predatory men because 
there are plenty of predatory men.

611
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,023
The problem is is that the courageous 
way to deal with the problem of the 

612
00:37:19,021 --> 00:37:24,021
Predator is to offer a hand in 
courageous trust and to invite forward a

613
00:37:24,241 --> 00:37:28,950
partner from the monster that's the.
That's that mythological manner in which

614
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:31,770
this is supposed to be undertaken.
The courageous,

615
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,950
a courageous part of the woman's 
journey,

616
00:37:34,951 --> 00:37:35,784
let's say,
is to face the monstrosity of a man and 

617
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:42,420
to invite out of that something more 
noble to emerge.

618
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,880
And there's courage in that ingenuine 
risk.

619
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,690
And I think that that's for gone in the 
accusation process.

620
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:52,350
And then the,
the other element of that seems to me to

621
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:53,880
be that,
well,

622
00:37:53,881 --> 00:37:58,500
if you are a Predator and irredeemable 
in your predatory nature,

623
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,370
then the best thing to do is to render 
you harmless.

624
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,473
And if we're going to obscure the 
relationship between competence and 

625
00:38:06,091 --> 00:38:06,924
power and assume that all of your 
striving upward is merely a 

626
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:10,254
manifestation of power,
then what we'll do is we can do as much 

627
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,270
as possible so that harmlessness can 
replace virtue.

628
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,860
And I see all of that driving these 
resentful disciplines in there.

629
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:23,070
And their aim is the ems escalation with
the men.

630
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,540
Yeah,
that's the evil queen.

631
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,550
Yeah.
Because we have the evil king,

632
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:28,440
right?
That's the tyrannical patriarchy.

633
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,900
Well,
the evil queen is lurking somewhere.

634
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,230
Yes.
So

635
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,130
the program is it.
A lot

636
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:36,963
of this is true,
but I'm a society does not seem to have 

637
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,680
the capacity to put that to one side and
set up rates the normal.

638
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:50,310
The fact that most men and most women 
are not like that and that there is,

639
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,453
there is a,
a natural desire and need of the sexist 

640
00:38:54,921 --> 00:38:55,754
to love each other,
to be united and to create children and 

641
00:38:58,301 --> 00:38:59,350
so on,
and that,

642
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,273
that,
that the old stability that that was 

643
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:06,460
built upon this has gone.
So I mean that,

644
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,190
uh,
nobody wants.

645
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:11,290
Nobody in the intellectual world wants 
to celebrate that.

646
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:12,560
So,
so I,

647
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:15,790
I just,
I had this interview a few a month

648
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:20,790
ago or so with a woman from Gq and she 
was fully onboard the,

649
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,280
the predatory male train,
let's say.

650
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:27,010
And you know,
when people like that interview me,

651
00:39:27,011 --> 00:39:28,990
they start talking about the patriarchy 
and I say,

652
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,030
well,
I don't believe in the patriarchy.

653
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:34,540
I don't buy that conceptual structure.
What's so interesting,

654
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:38,170
and this has happened more and more over
the years as they've developed this,

655
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,363
first of all,
the person that I would be talking to 

656
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,783
had some idea that it was hypothetically
possible to reject the idea of the 

657
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:47,284
patriarchy.
But now when I say I don't believe in 

658
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:50,140
it,
it's,

659
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,390
it's that idea is meant with stunned 
disbelief.

660
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:53,960
It's like,
well,

661
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,793
what do you mean you don't believe in 
the tyrannical Patriot that everyone 

662
00:39:58,181 --> 00:39:59,260
knows?
That's true.

663
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,520
And and I think,
well,

664
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:01,354
so here's your hypothesis.
So this is the hypothesis is that 

665
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:08,200
throughout history,
the fundamental relationship between man

666
00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:11,110
and woman is one of parasitism and 
exploitation.

667
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,160
That's it.
And so,

668
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,203
and that's the case,
I guess until 1960 and the publication 

669
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:17,920
of the feminine Mystique or something 
like that,

670
00:40:17,921 --> 00:40:20,740
but that's the entire course of human 
history that when the,

671
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:21,783
when it seems to me that the appropriate
story is that men and women labored 

672
00:40:25,451 --> 00:40:28,330
mightily under their terrible 
constraints for,

673
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:33,490
for uncounted centuries cooperating 
together by and large to,

674
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:38,500
to build some modicum of security and 
freedom and stability so that they could

675
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:39,334
raise children and have a somewhat 
harmonious and productive life and all 

676
00:40:42,761 --> 00:40:43,594
of a sudden it's become not only 
questionable to put forth that as a 

677
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,080
proposition,
but somehow tyrannical in,

678
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,973
in,
in essence just for positing it as a 

679
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:55,450
reality,
but the spot it because isn't it because

680
00:40:55,451 --> 00:41:00,220
of this peculiar view that the 
underlying all of this

681
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,790
as a kind of social structure that this 
is being created.

682
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:07,930
The distinction between men and women 
doesn't have it spaces in nature,

683
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,033
it's a basis is in the institutions that
we have created and since we created 

684
00:41:12,911 --> 00:41:14,080
them,
we can change them.

685
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,153
That there is,
there's been a sort of a kind of almost 

686
00:41:18,971 --> 00:41:22,660
hysterical invasion of everything by the
idea of human choice.

687
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,920
If,
if there is,

688
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:27,970
if there is a structure to the 
relationship between men and women,

689
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:31,340
then we ought to be able to change it.
And of course,

690
00:41:31,341 --> 00:41:35,690
chain it might mean that I have to 
change my sex in order to conform to the

691
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:38,810
way things are.
But that also has become a choice.

692
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:39,371
Well,
and is,

693
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:39,980
is,
is,

694
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,500
is not the very,
uh,

695
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:48,140
very a constant focus on division,
whether between man and woman or between

696
00:41:48,391 --> 00:41:49,224
left and right to orbitz or between this
race and that race or any other way in 

697
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:53,634
which we might,
we might divide people according to 

698
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:58,470
groups.
Isn't that very polarized,

699
00:41:58,471 --> 00:41:59,640
fractured,
uh,

700
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,280
fractured polarization.
A,

701
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,080
a sign of a loss of a common human 
culture of,

702
00:42:07,081 --> 00:42:07,371
uh,
of,

703
00:42:07,371 --> 00:42:07,671
uh,
of,

704
00:42:07,671 --> 00:42:07,931
uh,
of,

705
00:42:07,931 --> 00:42:08,400
uh,
of a,

706
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,800
of a universal plane in which we all we 
all are as,

707
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,420
as human beings.
And,

708
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,170
and so if,
if,

709
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,700
if,
if that's,

710
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:17,790
if that's,
if that is.

711
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:22,791
So I suppose what I take to be so very 
urgent in our time,

712
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,350
uh,
and,

713
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:28,830
and I wonder,
it might be difficult to find anyone who

714
00:42:28,831 --> 00:42:32,130
at least when you go down to a high 
enough level of resolution as you say,

715
00:42:32,131 --> 00:42:32,964
Jordan would not think this is true,
that we must recover that sense of our 

716
00:42:38,531 --> 00:42:43,531
selves as
entities that participate in a universal

717
00:42:45,871 --> 00:42:49,620
and transcendent plane.
That we have a common culture that I see

718
00:42:49,621 --> 00:42:53,010
myself in the other,
as you were saying earlier at Roger,

719
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,023
and I'd like to have both of your 
thoughts on what strategies were means 

720
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,780
for that recovery.
Uh,

721
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:04,220
and perhaps we can focus particularly on
the,

722
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,580
the,
uh,

723
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,620
the,
the,

724
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,120
the questions that we started with,
with,

725
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:09,983
uh,
Art Music you've written extensively in 

726
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:13,920
architecture,
of course,

727
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:14,803
are our Roger.
And you've thought long and hard about 

728
00:43:18,121 --> 00:43:19,470
the humanities.
Jordan,

729
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:20,410
what does,
what does,

730
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,820
what is the character of recovery?
How do we bring that about?

731
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,160
Well,
I'm,

732
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,650
I'm,
maybe again,

733
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:28,484
I think that there are reversed what you
have to identify those aspects of the 

734
00:43:34,101 --> 00:43:39,101
human condition that move of their own 
accord towards reconciliation,

735
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:40,460
you know,
uh,

736
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,293
rather than a conflict and a and 
division of the sort that you're 

737
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:47,780
referring to and we are very familiar 
with them.

738
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:48,643
It's not just that just love,
which of course is something which is a 

739
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:55,730
very complex thing and can't be,
can't be just conjured from the skies,

740
00:43:55,731 --> 00:43:56,564
but there are other aspects of our 
condition that we can educate through a 

741
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,130
first,
first of all,

742
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:04,963
through studying examples and then 
through imitation and then through a 

743
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:09,303
self discipline.
Obviously forgiveness is one of these 

744
00:44:11,841 --> 00:44:13,120
things.
Um,

745
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:18,170
and the habit of putting yourself in 
another person's perspective,

746
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,920
looking at yourself from outside,
uh,

747
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:21,763
and wondering whether you know,
you are as so seen acceptable to 

748
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:27,734
yourself.

749
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,521
All those,
uh,

750
00:44:28,521 --> 00:44:29,480
you know,
of course,

751
00:44:29,481 --> 00:44:31,070
again,
religion,

752
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,370
the Christian religion at least was,
um,

753
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:37,440
built upon.
That's kind of intellectual discipline.

754
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:38,603
The discipline of seeing your neighbor 
as yourself and seeing yourself 

755
00:44:43,111 --> 00:44:46,500
therefore as Amir neighbor,
and um,

756
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:47,363
I,
I,

757
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:50,520
I,
I suspect that you have,

758
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:55,550
we have to revive those basic moral 
discipline's not for,

759
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:01,590
for the use of people who don't have the
overarching faith,

760
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:06,830
the belief in the transcendental 
judgment to which we will we all called,

761
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,033
but who nevertheless have to be shown 
that we do live our lives as an object 

762
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:13,470
of judgment.
Nevertheless,

763
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:18,370
and here are some guides just read Anna 
Karenina for,

764
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,100
for example.
Um,

765
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,413
I know it takes a long time for facebook
addicted youth to read Anna Anna 

766
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:26,540
Karenina,
but there's still hope,

767
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:28,103
you know,

768
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:30,190
and,
and they're likely to listen to it if it

769
00:45:30,191 --> 00:45:32,060
becomes an audio book.
So,

770
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:33,290
so,
um,

771
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,713
well,
because maybe more people can listen 

772
00:45:35,771 --> 00:45:37,420
then can read.
I mean,

773
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,180
so,
so let's,

774
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,890
let's think about literature for,
for,

775
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:42,843
for a bit.
And so now if you read something like a 

776
00:45:46,631 --> 00:45:51,631
dusty see novel or Anna Karenina,
you're not really reading the account of

777
00:45:52,841 --> 00:45:53,674
a single person's life.
What you're reading is it like the 

778
00:45:57,341 --> 00:45:58,174
author has taken a variety of lives and 
amalgamated them in unified them into 

779
00:46:03,581 --> 00:46:06,790
something that's like a.
it's like a compilation of lives,

780
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,280
so it's life.
It's like life writ large,

781
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:14,050
so that's what fiction is.
It's more true than than reality because

782
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:15,123
just like a mathematical abstraction can
be more real than the thing that it 

783
00:46:17,621 --> 00:46:19,270
represents.
In some sense.

784
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,000
The fiction is.
It's like a.

785
00:46:22,001 --> 00:46:24,280
it's like a portrait.
If you sit for a portrait,

786
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,473
you'll sit and the artist will paint you
and then you'll sit again and then 

787
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,020
you'll say it again and then you'll say 
it again,

788
00:46:29,021 --> 00:46:32,260
and so the portrait is actually a 
composite of you,

789
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:35,380
and so it's got a richness sometimes 
that a photograph can't match,

790
00:46:35,381 --> 00:46:39,070
and a fictional character is actually a 
composite of many people,

791
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,173
and so the opportunity to read a great 
work of fiction is the opportunity to 

792
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:45,124
place yourself in the perspective not of
merely another person like you do in 

793
00:46:49,721 --> 00:46:54,430
normal discourse in a mundane setting,
but to place yourself in the perspective

794
00:46:54,431 --> 00:46:56,500
of a compiled character.

795
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,393
So you,
I've experienced that extraordinarily 

796
00:46:58,991 --> 00:47:03,160
powerfully with dusty eskies crime and 
punishment to put myself in the position

797
00:47:03,161 --> 00:47:08,161
of this student who was nihilistic and 
who had every reason to commit murder.

798
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:09,993
And it's an unbelievably intense novel 
because everybody in the novel is hyper 

799
00:47:14,321 --> 00:47:17,770
real and we think of fiction as falsity 
or,

800
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:18,783
or,
or,

801
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,590
or as,
as untruth.

802
00:47:20,591 --> 00:47:21,590
And it's not,
it's,

803
00:47:21,591 --> 00:47:23,170
it's,
it's abstraction.

804
00:47:23,171 --> 00:47:25,070
An abstraction isn't untruth.
It's,

805
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,033
it's more than truth often.
And so the humanities help us walk 

806
00:47:30,311 --> 00:47:31,144
through the souls of others and because 
we can imitate and it's one of our 

807
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,720
primary remarkable,
miraculous abilities.

808
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,793
We can imitate the compiled characters 
that we encounter in literature and 

809
00:47:43,391 --> 00:47:44,224
mythology and religion.
And that does help flush us out and 

810
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:48,580
ennoble us.
And we can,

811
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:49,443
we can.
I just wrote the Foreword to 

812
00:47:52,451 --> 00:47:56,410
Solzhenitsyn's Fiftieth Anniversary 
version of,

813
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,510
of the Gulag archipelago,
the abridged version.

814
00:47:58,510 --> 00:47:59,343
And I ran across his wish that
people could learn from what he 

815
00:48:05,351 --> 00:48:06,184
communicated all the horror and 
suffering to put themselves in the 

816
00:48:09,401 --> 00:48:13,840
position of both the perpetrator and the
and the accused simultaneously.

817
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:17,680
And to decide that that's not the road 
to walk down.

818
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,023
And so the advantage of placing yourself
in the position of other people is that 

819
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,070
if they're good people,
then you can be like them,

820
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:26,740
and if they're not good people,
then you can avoid that pathway.

821
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,810
And then you don't have to learn that 
through,

822
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:29,883
through the agony of direct personal 
experience in the short span of your 

823
00:48:33,371 --> 00:48:35,170
life.
There's nothing more,

824
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:36,303
there's nothing greater than you can do 
for people then to introduce them into 

825
00:48:39,281 --> 00:48:40,114
those patterns,
stories so that they can gain from the 

826
00:48:42,341 --> 00:48:44,020
catastrophes of the past.

827
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,270
No,
I agree with that.

828
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,430
But of course,
uh,

829
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:53,610
in fiction ones also concerned to 
identify if you're writing fiction,

830
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:55,503
identify with the character in order to 
understand that character because it's 

831
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:03,510
not as though
you can,

832
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:04,663
you can't actually grasp a character 
from the outside that you have to be 

833
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:13,540
able to see through his eyes what it,
what the world is in which he is.

834
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:14,470
And that is,
I think,

835
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:17,770
an exercise of the imagination,
which I value greatly.

836
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:19,350
Uh,
and um,

837
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:20,943
you don't necessarily come to the 
conclusion that therefore I don't want 

838
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:26,650
to be like that.
It might be just enough to say,

839
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,110
now I see that,
that,

840
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,230
that that's a possible human being,
um,

841
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:32,103
and you knowledge of the possibilities 
is amplified and your sense and your 

842
00:49:37,301 --> 00:49:41,170
ability to position yourself in those 
possibilities also,

843
00:49:41,171 --> 00:49:41,860
I think.

844
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,930
Right?
So that's a matter of differentiation as

845
00:49:43,931 --> 00:49:45,340
well as direct.
Yes.

846
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:50,320
I think sometimes in my more dire 
moments that this opposition to cultural

847
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,210
appropriation,
right?

848
00:49:52,211 --> 00:49:53,044
So the idea that I'm not allowed anymore
to imagine myself say fictionally as a 

849
00:49:56,321 --> 00:49:59,200
woman or as,
or as a character from another ethnicity

850
00:49:59,201 --> 00:50:02,710
or even to play the role that role as a,
as an actor,

851
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:03,813
I think that it's,
it's part of the assault on the idea of 

852
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:08,373
the individual and the non zero sum game
because it precludes the possibility 

853
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,940
that I can take on the role of another 
and,

854
00:50:15,941 --> 00:50:19,120
and understanding manner and actually 
facilitated dialogue.

855
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,133
And that undermines the claim.
I would say that everything is only a 

856
00:50:23,081 --> 00:50:26,950
secondary consequence of power because 
if I can actually bridge that gap,

857
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,280
well then I'm not isolated in my group 
or my ethnicity or whatever it is I can.

858
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:32,203
I can become partly you and we can 
communicate and I would say because of 

859
00:50:35,121 --> 00:50:38,270
that literature and art is a great 
threat to ideology,

860
00:50:38,271 --> 00:50:41,510
especially of the group identity kind.
And of course they're perfectly aware of

861
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:42,344
that,
which is why the radicals on that side 

862
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,790
of the equation are doing everything 
they can to,

863
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,073
to a reporter from the New York Times 
who wrote a rather scurrilous piece 

864
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:52,970
about me.
She had done the literature degree at,

865
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,270
at Columbia,
a bright woman,

866
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,253
and she told me in all honesty and an 
apparent transparency that she had no 

867
00:51:01,221 --> 00:51:02,054
idea this is how deep this is.
This has become saturated into our 

868
00:51:05,961 --> 00:51:08,090
culture.
She had no idea until she,

869
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,193
until she had graduated from Columbia 
that there was any other way of reading 

870
00:51:13,491 --> 00:51:16,340
a work of literature except through the 
postmodern Lens.

871
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,473
And the postmodern Lens is well,
who are the groups that are being 

872
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:25,190
represented and what power games are at 
play and who benefits.

873
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,420
And,
and I mean,

874
00:51:26,421 --> 00:51:29,570
I don't know if because she turned out 
to be quite a strange person.

875
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:30,800
Um,
but,

876
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:31,663
so I have no idea if that,
if that was a ploy on her part or 

877
00:51:34,131 --> 00:51:36,050
whether that was like a,
like a,

878
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,590
a naive,
what would you call confession,

879
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,753
but it's increasingly the case that,
that is how literature is taught in my 

880
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:46,730
home province of Ontario.
The Elementary Teachers,

881
00:51:46,731 --> 00:51:47,564
Federation of Ontario wants to start 
teaching literature from a postmodern 

882
00:51:50,331 --> 00:51:53,690
critical perspective in elementary 
school to demolish it.

883
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:55,820
Well,
there we,

884
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,640
uh,
I mean I'm in favor of cultural,

885
00:51:58,270 --> 00:51:59,890
cultural appropriation.
I mean,

886
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,270
I'm a product of it.
I,

887
00:52:01,271 --> 00:52:04,920
I appropriated the idea of the English 
gentleman and,

888
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,950
you know,
and I'm trying to make myself be it a,

889
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:14,110
I know it's a Paideia
that's part of doing it well,

890
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,820
but I've understood the world from the 
inside and another way.

891
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,970
But in a,
I just wrote a book of stories which was

892
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,013
reviewed,
but,

893
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,580
uh,
somebody who says,

894
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:25,420
you know,
this,

895
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:29,500
these stories make cultural 
appropriation into a virtue.

896
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:32,160
So I felt good about that.
They,

897
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,340
they begin with a,
an inside view of the psyche,

898
00:52:36,341 --> 00:52:37,174
of a,
uh,

899
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:37,990
of,
um,

900
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:39,070
a terrorist,
have an,

901
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,070
uh,
an Arab terrorists who,

902
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:44,440
who's,
who has a legacy of vengeance and,

903
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:48,430
um,
who is a failure and

904
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:53,260
who's lost.
I tried to make real in the,

905
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:55,990
in the feelings of the reader as he,
as he reads it.

906
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:58,170
And um,
uh,

907
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:59,013
and then the subsequent stories show the
same kind of loss in completely 

908
00:53:01,931 --> 00:53:03,160
different people.
So

909
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:06,330
I wanted to bring up that a book of 
stories,

910
00:53:06,331 --> 00:53:10,920
actually a souls in twilight by Sir 
Roger Scruton,

911
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:12,413
a series of five short stories of five,
I think is it five short stories each 

912
00:53:16,351 --> 00:53:19,650
which are our portraits of a character 
at a certain moment in time.

913
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:20,963
I think it's safe to say Roger,
that they're all tragic stories in a 

914
00:53:23,641 --> 00:53:26,430
sense.
What I found,

915
00:53:26,431 --> 00:53:27,264
so moving about those stories is that 
these are individuals in states of 

916
00:53:32,401 --> 00:53:34,470
dislocation,
anchor lists,

917
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:38,400
seeking depth,
meaning truth,

918
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:40,080
stability,
uh,

919
00:53:40,081 --> 00:53:43,620
and yet in their confusion,
in their darkness,

920
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:46,350
willing against that very thing that 
they seek,

921
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:47,184
or you might say violating.
We're transgressing that sacred thing 

922
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:51,144
that they're longing for.
That's not what's beautiful about the 

923
00:53:55,171 --> 00:53:56,280
book.
Um,

924
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:57,493
uh,
what's beautiful is that in the reading 

925
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,713
the reader,
her or himself comes to a sense of what 

926
00:54:04,891 --> 00:54:08,670
that longing is for positively a sense 
of the,

927
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:13,940
the stability of love or out of home or 
have relationship.

928
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:17,880
And,
and,

929
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,713
and I suppose what I want to ask 
following up on this is that that seems 

930
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:26,010
to be a profoundly redemptive vision 
that you have in that,

931
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,170
in those beautiful stories,
Roger,

932
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:31,650
at that,
that it's showing the persistence of the

933
00:54:31,651 --> 00:54:35,580
beautiful and have the good even in its 
absence,

934
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:36,503
that I can read that story and have a 
perception of what positively I am I am 

935
00:54:39,841 --> 00:54:42,520
looking for and just try to refer to 
something that you say in,

936
00:54:42,521 --> 00:54:43,860
in one of your books,
Jordan,

937
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:46,960
that,
that even through an experience of,

938
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:52,020
of evil one can develop an apprehension 
of what the good is.

939
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,800
And wondering if you could each say 
something about the,

940
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:57,143
that you know,
either either there is our reality to 

941
00:55:00,841 --> 00:55:01,674
these transcendent things where there is
not the condition did either just a 

942
00:55:03,661 --> 00:55:04,494
construct,
goodness or beauty and truth or they 

943
00:55:06,421 --> 00:55:08,220
have a transcendent.
And,

944
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,850
and sovereign,
persistent re reality.

945
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
And I'm wondering if you can each say 
something about the,

946
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:17,543
the persistence or sovereignty of these 
things even amidst our darkness and a 

947
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:24,563
suffering.

948
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:25,660
Well,
I,

949
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:30,660
I would say that in tragedy when tragedy
Israeli effective,

950
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:32,413
uh,
there is a redemption offered in this 

951
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,350
through suffering the,
the,

952
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:38,070
the,
the,

953
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:40,060
the,
the we,

954
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:41,603
we encounter the possibility in tragedy 
that a human being can through the most 

955
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:47,544
noble motives also
bringing on down upon himself 

956
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:55,820
destruction.
And uh,

957
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:56,963
this destruction is no different from 
the destruction that's going to affect 

958
00:55:59,461 --> 00:56:02,710
all of us in the end anyway.
But here is somebody who,

959
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,480
who has faced.
It's down in some way that his Nova,

960
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:07,363
who's ability of nature and his ability 
to go out towards others in a condition 

961
00:56:11,821 --> 00:56:12,654
of,
of love and reconciliation has not been 

962
00:56:15,031 --> 00:56:15,864
taken away from him.
And the spectacle of that is all the 

963
00:56:20,881 --> 00:56:23,310
more intense because nevertheless,

964
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:29,240
the death intervenes and takes him away 
as it will take you and me away.

965
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,120
But without having had the chance to 
reveal a nobility or even to acquire it,

966
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:35,161
you know.
So I,

967
00:56:35,161 --> 00:56:40,161
I think that for that reason,
it's very important that in literature,

968
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:45,820
a noble characters are seen in a 
condition of loss sometimes that,

969
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,330
uh,
and their,

970
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:49,573
their redemption comes because even 
though they've lost what we all must in 

971
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,043
the end lose,
there is that in which is struggling 

972
00:56:59,111 --> 00:57:02,590
towards reconciliation with their own 
condition and with others,

973
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:07,800
it's the sense that they are living as 
another and not as a self.

974
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:08,690
You know,
that's,

975
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:09,523
that's,
I think it's a crucial thing that see 

976
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:12,893
the Gulag archipelago is often viewed as
an endless documentation of the horrors 

977
00:57:17,591 --> 00:57:20,890
of the Soviet enterprise.
But it was an investigation.

978
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:21,813
It was an experiment in literary 
investigation and that isn't what the 

979
00:57:25,841 --> 00:57:26,674
book is about.

980
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:31,920
The book is about Solzhenitsyn's 
observations of people in those terrible

981
00:57:32,231 --> 00:57:33,064
situations who did not contribute to the
terror and who transcended it and the 

982
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:39,783
unbelievably power,
powerful impact observing that had on 

983
00:57:43,421 --> 00:57:44,254
him and the personal transformation he 
underwent as a consequence of observing 

984
00:57:47,771 --> 00:57:48,604
those people and the decision he made 
because of seeing them in their 

985
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,133
ultimately tragic circumstances 
transcend that to to to transform his 

986
00:57:58,031 --> 00:57:58,864
life from the bottom up and to write 
this great book and to reveal the utter 

987
00:58:02,381 --> 00:58:03,214
catastrophe of that entire ideological 
movement and so you deal see the light 

988
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:09,063
most clearly when it's super imposed 
against the darkest possible background 

989
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:13,623
and so and great literature which polls 
people way down into the depths and in 

990
00:58:17,651 --> 00:58:18,580
in this,
in this,

991
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:20,650
in this compiled,
fictional manner.

992
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:24,010
Then it also does at the same time 
highlight what's what's.

993
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:29,070
What's the opposite of that?
So I it by reading of

994
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,730
of your,
your,

995
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,440
your,
your work,

996
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:33,663
both of you.
There's an implicitly theological 

997
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:38,103
character here and we can't speak about 
the transcendent in a certain sense 

998
00:58:40,721 --> 00:58:45,721
without being theological at it.
Why is it that we can't just delights,

999
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,580
just can't be completely shut out.
I mean,

1000
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,210
if,
if,

1001
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:50,043
if,
if,

1002
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:51,213
if evil and darkness,
we're the sovereign principles as a 

1003
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:56,530
human,
as it might say,

1004
00:58:56,531 --> 00:58:57,700
metaphysically,
well,

1005
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,810
they could,
it could just be all delights,

1006
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:03,910
could just be completely blackened and 
yet that's not what we see.

1007
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,820
And I'm wondering if you would each 
comment on the,

1008
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:11,740
what you take to be the,
I think what,

1009
00:59:11,741 --> 00:59:14,800
what might,
what might be a theological articulation

1010
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:19,030
of the facts on the ground?
If the facts are that you can't shut the

1011
00:59:19,031 --> 00:59:20,740
lights right out,
that there is still there.

1012
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:21,810
What,
uh,

1013
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,593
what's going on there?
I totally agree with what Jordan said 

1014
00:59:26,751 --> 00:59:30,050
about the Gulag archipelago.
Um,

1015
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:34,510
and that goes back to just ask is,
uh,

1016
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,120
from the house with the dead.
You know,

1017
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:40,010
his accountant of being in Osiris,
much milder,

1018
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:41,123
we've kind of imprisonment,
but nevertheless it was almost a 

1019
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:45,620
vacation home in comparison.
No,

1020
00:59:45,621 --> 00:59:47,020
I agree.
But nevertheless,

1021
00:59:47,021 --> 00:59:49,820
he described these characters who for 
whom,

1022
00:59:49,821 --> 00:59:54,821
that everything has been taken away.
But he also notes that in each of them I

1023
00:59:56,991 --> 01:00:01,991
can find the spark of God.
Something which Janacek repeated when he

1024
01:00:03,081 --> 01:00:03,914
made this into the,
into that wonderful Libretto for his 

1025
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:11,350
opera and,
and Yana check tractor show in music.

1026
01:00:11,571 --> 01:00:15,830
How these derelict characters will 
suddenly shine with that,

1027
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:16,723
with that light from another source that
doesn't come just from what they are in 

1028
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:23,990
those circumstances,
but from something higher.

1029
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,280
And I think,
um,

1030
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:29,720
you know,
I would say one is always obliged to use

1031
01:00:29,721 --> 01:00:33,810
metaphors when we get to this point,
but it is true that,

1032
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:35,083
that you can find in someone even in the
most deprived and desolate 

1033
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:43,810
circumstances,
that home which you can blow to co two,

1034
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:47,930
caused a spark once again to,
to light up inside him.

1035
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:51,890
And that is as far as we get to meeting 
God.

1036
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,233
But,
um,

1037
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:58,160
there is no reason to think that we need
to get any further in my view.

1038
01:00:58,310 --> 01:00:59,143
Um,
that's what everybody saw in Maximilian 

1039
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:06,190
Colby when he offered himself in,
in the,

1040
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:08,210
in Auschwitz for,
you know,

1041
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:11,880
to sacrifice why he was,
um,

1042
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:16,370
a canonized.
Suddenly you see that there is something

1043
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:21,290
else in all of us in which in the 
circumstances,

1044
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:22,124
however severe and deprived will will 
shine from with a different light and 

1045
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:31,630
make those circumstances worthwhile 
because they produced that light.

1046
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:32,643
It couldn't be,
in some sense the mercy of God that 

1047
01:01:34,461 --> 01:01:39,461
keeps him hidden from us because if you 
imagine that your sacred duty is to blow

1048
01:01:40,911 --> 01:01:41,744
on those embers that you described,
even among people who are in desolate 

1049
01:01:45,441 --> 01:01:46,274
straights.
Then every time you fail to take that 

1050
01:01:49,161 --> 01:01:49,994
opportunity,
then you tell things badly towards what 

1051
01:01:52,551 --> 01:01:54,020
they shouldn't be tilted towards.

1052
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,033
And it could be that the revelation of 
your inadequacy in the face of that 

1053
01:01:58,910 --> 01:01:59,743
moral duty,
which would be in some sense equivalent 

1054
01:02:02,061 --> 01:02:05,840
to an encounter with God would be enough
to tear you into pieces.

1055
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:09,230
And so maybe you get glimpses of that 
now and then because that's,

1056
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:14,150
that's all you in your current depraved 
moral state could stand of seeing of the

1057
01:02:14,151 --> 01:02:14,984
face of God.
And I think there's something to that 

1058
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:21,090
that's similar and says things to that 
effect.

1059
01:02:21,091 --> 01:02:21,990
I think.
Yeah.

1060
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:23,600
And um,
yeah.

1061
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:24,443
So I often heard in the old communist 
days when I used to travel around 

1062
01:02:27,991 --> 01:02:28,824
Eastern Europe and,
and meet people who are in really dire 

1063
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:32,311
straits,
safe,

1064
01:02:32,311 --> 01:02:33,840
said similar things,
you know,

1065
01:02:33,841 --> 01:02:34,890
that,
that,

1066
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:38,940
um,
that God would reveal himself.

1067
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:40,200
But,
uh,

1068
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,033
in these circumstances,
the revelation will be something too 

1069
01:02:43,201 --> 01:02:45,010
strong.
What I could bear.

1070
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,300
That's a beautiful image you've given 
us,

1071
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,193
Roger,
of blowing on the embers within blowing 

1072
01:02:54,531 --> 01:02:56,900
on the embers of transcendence.
Um,

1073
01:02:57,710 --> 01:02:58,543
I'd ask you both about the forms of 
culture and institutional life that 

1074
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:07,340
produce that blowing on the embers in 
the individual.

1075
01:03:07,341 --> 01:03:08,174
It seems to me both of you have a very 
deep sense of the dignity of the human 

1076
01:03:12,501 --> 01:03:13,334
individual,
of the individual's connection to the 

1077
01:03:16,581 --> 01:03:20,990
transcendent,
the grounding fact of our existence.

1078
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:26,620
What would be the forms of culture that 
we would say to be necessary or most,

1079
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:28,423
uh,
most inclined to foster in the 

1080
01:03:31,191 --> 01:03:36,191
individual that blowing of the flame?
I think the most accessible form for,

1081
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:40,803
for most people is music and music to me
is the most representational form of 

1082
01:03:45,501 --> 01:03:46,334
art.
Because I think that the world is made 

1083
01:03:47,931 --> 01:03:52,010
out of patterns and we perceive some 
patterns as objects,

1084
01:03:52,011 --> 01:03:52,844
but fundamentally it's patterns and what
you want is all the patterns of the 

1085
01:03:56,781 --> 01:03:57,614
world to interact harmoniously in,
in something where every element is 

1086
01:04:01,311 --> 01:04:03,620
related,
intelligibly to every other element.

1087
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,930
And I think that when your life is in 
harmony,

1088
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:07,093
that you can feel that.
And when you're dancing to beautiful 

1089
01:04:09,321 --> 01:04:10,790
music,
you're acting that out.

1090
01:04:10,791 --> 01:04:13,040
It's the music is,
is the,

1091
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:13,963
is the music of the spheres,
and you're participating in the 

1092
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,010
powdering of your being in accordance 
with that structure.

1093
01:04:19,011 --> 01:04:22,340
And that gives you an intimation of,
of transcendence.

1094
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,160
And,
and it's not criticizable.

1095
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:26,780
That's the thing that's so lovely about 
it,

1096
01:04:26,781 --> 01:04:27,614
is even as our society has become more 
cynical and more self destructive and 

1097
01:04:31,551 --> 01:04:32,384
more deconstructionist,
the power of music has in fact grown 

1098
01:04:34,971 --> 01:04:35,804
because it speaks to that eternal 
harmony and the reality of that eternal 

1099
01:04:39,891 --> 01:04:43,730
harmony in a way that mere intellect 
cannot deny.

1100
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,500
And I mean,
I've was always amused.

1101
01:04:45,501 --> 01:04:46,770
I went to this show,
uh,

1102
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:49,340
the ramones,
a punk band from New York.

1103
01:04:49,341 --> 01:04:50,174
It was the loudest concert I'd ever 
heard by by a good factor of 10 in my 

1104
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:58,850
ears rang for like three days afterwards
and there were all these like nihilistic

1105
01:04:58,851 --> 01:05:02,180
punk rockers all crammed into this 
theater and below me.

1106
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:05,300
There was a mosh pit and it was like 
ants on a frying pan.

1107
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:09,950
They were just smashing into each other 
and throwing people around up above them

1108
01:05:09,951 --> 01:05:10,784
and it was quite rough and they're all 
having this beautifully transcendent 

1109
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:14,983
musical experience which belied all of 
nihilism and it was and they absolutely 

1110
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:21,590
thrived on it.
It was like,

1111
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:24,160
and even the lyrics were harsh and 
nihilistic,

1112
01:05:24,161 --> 01:05:27,130
but it didn't matter because the music,
even if it's rough,

1113
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:27,993
even if it's in its rough form,
was something that united them in the 

1114
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:36,061
sense of this like pattern beauty and 
brought them together and so exposure to

1115
01:05:36,251 --> 01:05:40,690
music that's people die without music.
It's like music is everything.

1116
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,910
I mean it's not everything but I beg.
It's everything about the beauty of this

1117
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:47,260
particular experience

1118
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:54,080
I think actually don't see it as an 
extremely important phenomenon.

1119
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:59,400
It partly because traditionally dancing 
was dancing with someone.

1120
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:05,050
The width has been taken out of dancing 
and uh,

1121
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:05,923
the head bashing and so on that goes on 
with heavy metal and the right is 

1122
01:06:09,721 --> 01:06:12,370
dancing against someone,
you know,

1123
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:14,370
the,
the wideness of the dancers.

1124
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,233
I think there's something really.
We see it in Scottish reels and things 

1125
01:06:17,881 --> 01:06:21,510
like that where the whole community is 
dancing in an orderly way,

1126
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:26,750
recognizing that their need for law and 
order and taking pleasure in it.

1127
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:27,693
And I thought,
I find that a very near to a 

1128
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:31,920
transcendent experience.
Um,

1129
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:33,023
I,
I feel a kind of narcissism has crept 

1130
01:06:34,621 --> 01:06:39,180
into the dance with,
through recent forms of dance music,

1131
01:06:39,181 --> 01:06:41,370
but I mean,
that's my old geezer

1132
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,000
or,
or,

1133
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,511
or,
or,

1134
01:06:43,511 --> 01:06:45,190
or his or his.
Um,

1135
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,530
or is it simply to say that there,
that,

1136
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:54,280
that the principle itself is sovereign.
It everyone thinks about the logic,

1137
01:06:54,281 --> 01:06:55,050
for example,
of,

1138
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:56,890
of,
of Dante's inferno,

1139
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:58,700
um,
uh,

1140
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:02,620
which has ever more degraded forms of 
knowing and loving,

1141
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:04,240
um,
that,

1142
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:08,250
uh,
that the,

1143
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:09,243
the mechanism of the nature of you might
say the nature of the soul is the same 

1144
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:18,070
at the top of paradise as it is at the,
at the bottom of inferno,

1145
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:22,990
but it has all these infinite gradations
of wholeness.

1146
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,940
And so I don't think we have to say 
that,

1147
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:25,803
that,
that the,

1148
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:28,040
the mosh pit is,
uh,

1149
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:28,620
is,
is,

1150
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:29,220
is,
is,

1151
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:31,690
is,
is equivalent as a work of art to,

1152
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:35,650
to Beethoven or,
or Palestrina or Janacek,

1153
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:39,460
but rather than perhaps what's going on 
in,

1154
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,730
in,
in that is nonetheless a longing for the

1155
01:07:42,731 --> 01:07:46,070
pattern and the recognition of the other
that you,

1156
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,093
you say

1157
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:48,263
yes,
but your original question was how do 

1158
01:07:49,891 --> 01:07:51,390
we,
how do we,

1159
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:52,563
a coax people back into the,
into a life which is based on the 

1160
01:07:57,121 --> 01:08:00,270
recognition of the other rather than the
gratification of the self.

1161
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,840
Because that's essentially what we're 
talking about with the

1162
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:06,240
today at least.
And I,

1163
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:11,290
I would say teaching people how to help 
others.

1164
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:14,160
Uh,
the role of the teacher,

1165
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:15,583
is it very dignified one,
he's only so if the teacher actually 

1166
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:22,063
thinks that he is helping the pupil to a
body of knowledge that he has access to 

1167
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:32,300
and that sense of helping other people 
is a very rare thing and it's,

1168
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:33,203
it's made more rare by the,
the welfare state and the ready 

1169
01:08:36,711 --> 01:08:37,544
availability of subsidies for a 
subsidized life without leaning on any 

1170
01:08:44,661 --> 01:08:46,220
particular person,
you know,

1171
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:47,270
uh,
and I think,

1172
01:08:47,271 --> 01:08:48,104
um,
relations of dependence are actually 

1173
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:53,900
very positive if they're accepted on 
both sides,

1174
01:08:53,901 --> 01:08:54,734
you know,
and I think,

1175
01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:55,803
um,
something that we don't teach the boys 

1176
01:08:57,841 --> 01:08:58,674
scouts movement and all that they used 
to teach a young people these things 

1177
01:09:02,331 --> 01:09:03,164
teach people how to go out and help 
those who needed them and how to make 

1178
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:10,130
those little day to day sacrifices.

1179
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:11,053
Um,
and eventually through the process of 

1180
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:18,770
imitation and imagination,
a character grows based on that.

1181
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:22,700
I feel that there isn't any obstacle to 
this.

1182
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:26,240
It's a very simple form of education.
All of us can do it.

1183
01:09:26,241 --> 01:09:27,074
And all of us who have children do it.
I'm sure Jordan does it with his 

1184
01:09:31,461 --> 01:09:33,610
children the same as I with mine.
Of course,

1185
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:36,170
you know,
you're always disappointed.

1186
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:39,130
They always go away into the corner with
the,

1187
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:42,290
with their wretched little iphones and 
so on.

1188
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:44,180
But nevertheless,
um,

1189
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:47,360
it,
some of it rubs off and you know,

1190
01:09:47,361 --> 01:09:52,280
that in the long run they will be 
capable not just of finding love,

1191
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:57,110
but also of offering forgiveness and 
working for rick reconciliation.

1192
01:09:57,710 --> 01:10:02,710
I don't think in a sort of narcissistic 
culture which is propagated by the media

1193
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:07,340
and by the universities,
uh,

1194
01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:08,243
that,
um,

1195
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:10,460
that they're being pointed in that 
direction.

1196
01:10:10,461 --> 01:10:11,294
That is true.
But then it's up to us to point them in 

1197
01:10:14,181 --> 01:10:15,020
another direction.

1198
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:19,700
I think as an academic,
we talked already about that place where

1199
01:10:19,701 --> 01:10:20,534
the meaning and the fact are conjoined 
and that's the proper place to lecture 

1200
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:24,974
from because people who lecture 
constantly make the presumption that 

1201
01:10:30,561 --> 01:10:34,970
they're there to deliver a set of facts.
But there's an infinite set of facts.

1202
01:10:34,971 --> 01:10:38,240
And so at the very least,
you have to select the facts and there's

1203
01:10:38,241 --> 01:10:40,700
a mechanism that selects the facts and 
what,

1204
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:45,930
what you want to do as an academic is,
is tell your students through,

1205
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,233
through direct discourse and also 
through action about something that 

1206
01:10:50,781 --> 01:10:54,650
you've encountered that you've fallen in
love with and to,

1207
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:57,080
and to communicate the love that you 
have for that,

1208
01:10:57,081 --> 01:10:59,060
the love for literature and,
and not to say,

1209
01:10:59,061 --> 01:11:00,650
well,
you should read this book,

1210
01:11:00,651 --> 01:11:01,520
but to say,
well,

1211
01:11:01,521 --> 01:11:02,354
here's this book and here's what it can 
open up for you and this is how it does 

1212
01:11:05,631 --> 01:11:05,810
it.

1213
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:08,330
And,
and this is what you'll gain from it.

1214
01:11:08,331 --> 01:11:11,090
It's an inestimable gain and there's 
some struggle in it.

1215
01:11:11,091 --> 01:11:12,470
But,
but there's a,

1216
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,000
there's something it that's of,
of,

1217
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,610
of unbelievable utility.
And you have to believe that in order to

1218
01:11:17,611 --> 01:11:19,380
communicate it.
And then that's.

1219
01:11:19,381 --> 01:11:21,350
So that opens one of those doors,
you know,

1220
01:11:21,351 --> 01:11:23,220
and maybe some students will step 
through that and think,

1221
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:25,410
well maybe that sounds like something I 
need.

1222
01:11:25,411 --> 01:11:27,960
I'm in this dire situation and I need 
something.

1223
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:30,300
I need a life raft.
I need to.

1224
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:32,840
It needs something to boy me upward and 
it's gonna.

1225
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:33,683
Take some effort obviously because 
nothing worthwhile comes without effort 

1226
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,710
to communicate that commitment you have 
to these two,

1227
01:11:40,711 --> 01:11:42,530
these two,
these phenomena,

1228
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:43,364
the phenomena that we already talked 
about to beauty and truth and to 

1229
01:11:45,391 --> 01:11:48,480
literature and entered the classics in 
the humanities.

1230
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:52,170
It isn't enough to to say what they are 
and to transmit them.

1231
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:53,003
It's to.
It's to manifest yourself as a living 

1232
01:11:55,471 --> 01:11:56,304
part of that tradition and to end to 
show yourself thereby as a model for 

1233
01:12:00,841 --> 01:12:05,160
living out as much as you can,
what that tradition represents,

1234
01:12:05,161 --> 01:12:05,994
and to show that that's so much better 
than like a short term pleasure seeking 

1235
01:12:10,321 --> 01:12:11,154
nihilism,
that they're not even in the same 

1236
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:16,260
conceptual universe and people are far 
more open to that.

1237
01:12:16,261 --> 01:12:17,850
They know already.
People know,

1238
01:12:17,851 --> 01:12:22,851
especially when they're hurt.
They know that happiness is fleeting and

1239
01:12:22,921 --> 01:12:25,680
that suffering requires a sustaining 
meaning.

1240
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:29,070
Everyone who's lived knows that and so 
to say,

1241
01:12:29,071 --> 01:12:29,904
well,
here's some bomb for the suffering and 

1242
01:12:31,861 --> 01:12:35,940
it's profound and deep and and here's 
what it's meant to me and here's how you

1243
01:12:35,941 --> 01:12:39,960
can incorporate it into your life.
It's like people are absolutely starving

1244
01:12:39,961 --> 01:12:41,990
for that or dying of thirst for them.

1245
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:46,960
This connects with what you earlier said
about the curriculum,

1246
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:48,083
the,
that the old way of teaching the 

1247
01:12:50,081 --> 01:12:53,310
humanities was in that manner.
Uh,

1248
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,233
as objects of love.
This is what I have loved what previous 

1249
01:12:57,251 --> 01:12:59,530
generations have loved to and handed 
onto me.

1250
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:02,920
Hey,
try it out and you will love it too.

1251
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:08,260
Whereas the postmodern curriculum is a 
curriculum of hatred.

1252
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:09,281
It's,
it's a,

1253
01:13:09,281 --> 01:13:12,760
uh,
directed against a cultural inheritance.

1254
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:15,510
One after another.
The work separated before us,

1255
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:18,130
stripped naked and thrashed,
you know,

1256
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:18,840
uh,
um,

1257
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,320
uh,
by what,

1258
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,273
by revealing whatever ideology will 
power structure is being concealed 

1259
01:13:25,001 --> 01:13:26,320
within them.
And that's,

1260
01:13:26,321 --> 01:13:27,154
of course there's not why they were 
written and it's not how they should be 

1261
01:13:29,051 --> 01:13:29,720
understood.

1262
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:32,110
It's not why they survived.
Exactly either.

1263
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:36,970
But like this is the best that the best 
of us could produce and it's nothing.

1264
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:38,520
Why should you bother?
Yeah,

1265
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,730
yeah,
exactly.

1266
01:13:39,731 --> 01:13:40,564
And it means that students who go 
through that curriculum come out with a 

1267
01:13:44,381 --> 01:13:45,214
sentence of the hopelessness of 
everything and thus are successfully 

1268
01:13:49,421 --> 01:13:51,970
educated by postmodernist standards.
Yeah,

1269
01:13:51,971 --> 01:13:53,140
yeah.
I suppose that's right.

1270
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:54,393
But,
um,

1271
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,290
you know,
there's no reason why one should,

1272
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,230
one should accept this one.
Oh,

1273
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:02,840
all good things begin,
uh,

1274
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:06,040
in the,
in small areas because,

1275
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:08,430
because two or three people,
uh,

1276
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:09,310
you know,
well,

1277
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:13,660
it's Christ said two or three are 
gathered my name there am I with you,

1278
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:18,130
but at the same as it is an old couch,
right activities,

1279
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:21,620
it's perhaps a friendship will,
will,

1280
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:22,810
uh,
will be gay.

1281
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,500
It will start up a reading group and 
after that reading group,

1282
01:14:26,501 --> 01:14:31,240
there'll be others come in gradually if 
it's founded on love of the thing that's

1283
01:14:31,241 --> 01:14:32,074
being studied and offered,
he will always try and fit in the long 

1284
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:35,344
run over this negativity.
The problem is the negativity is 

1285
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:39,124
subsidized.
It's subsidized by universities who are 

1286
01:14:41,531 --> 01:14:45,370
paid for by governments who are paid for
by tax payers and so on.

1287
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:46,870
Uh,
and the,

1288
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:50,260
the answer is to take away those 
subsidies and,

1289
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:51,123
uh,
and deprived of education completely of 

1290
01:14:52,871 --> 01:14:55,690
money.
And it will be back with us again.

1291
01:14:57,190 --> 01:14:58,023
I suppose I suggested something like 
that in public in Canada not so long 

1292
01:15:01,871 --> 01:15:02,704
ago,
to cut the budgets of the universities 

1293
01:15:03,731 --> 01:15:07,810
across the board by 25 percent and let 
them sort themselves out because,

1294
01:15:07,811 --> 01:15:08,644
but the,
the no subsidy idea at least forces 

1295
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,273
those who provide education to do it 
purely on its merits and the fact that 

1296
01:15:16,511 --> 01:15:17,344
these counterproductive disciplines,
let's say have been subsidized for so 

1297
01:15:21,341 --> 01:15:23,710
long,
has given them a power that's far,

1298
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:24,633
far outstrips their,
their credibility and their 

1299
01:15:26,501 --> 01:15:27,620
attractiveness.
Right

1300
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:30,570
now.
I wanted to,

1301
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:33,530
to
point out a,

1302
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:34,371
it will this,
this,

1303
01:15:34,371 --> 01:15:35,204
this chat may be seen by a few people 
online at some point and draw attention 

1304
01:15:39,811 --> 01:15:42,410
to the vet that we're all wearing 
poppies to,

1305
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:43,333
of course,
is a,

1306
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:44,541
is a,
is a,

1307
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:49,541
is a symbol of respect and memory for an
inheritance of our own past,

1308
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:52,430
uh,
for the,

1309
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:54,013
the suffering
that has given us or at least protected 

1310
01:15:59,541 --> 01:16:00,374
and given us so much that we hold dear.
I'd like to ask you both about memory 

1311
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:07,663
and the inheritance of the past and,
and what it means to have a pedagogy of 

1312
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:18,890
what it means to have a pedagogy of the 
transcendent,

1313
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:21,530
uh,
in relation to our past.

1314
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:24,860
How do you open open those,
those,

1315
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:27,050
those doorways,
and perhaps,

1316
01:16:27,051 --> 01:16:28,150
uh,
if,

1317
01:16:28,151 --> 01:16:31,970
if the spirit moves you to a speak about
works that you love,

1318
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:34,940
that you've been able to open up to 
others.

1319
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,393
One of the reasons for remembering in 
the way that we remember the armistice 

1320
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:44,380
in the first world war,
one of the reasons is,

1321
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:49,440
is gratitude and gratitude is in short 
supply in our societies today.

1322
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:51,453
And,
um,

1323
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:55,000
it's the,
it's the greatest gift that we can offer

1324
01:16:55,001 --> 01:16:57,400
in fact,
sorts of people who are dead because,

1325
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,290
uh,
what else can we do,

1326
01:16:59,390 --> 01:17:00,223
uh,
except to acknowledge what their 

1327
01:17:01,151 --> 01:17:02,650
sacrifice.
So,

1328
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:03,693
um,
I think that gratitude is a fundamental 

1329
01:17:05,351 --> 01:17:07,640
part of memory.
Um,

1330
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:09,130
there are,
of course,

1331
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:12,850
accumulations of guilts and so on.
Uh,

1332
01:17:12,851 --> 01:17:17,150
and those are being emphasized all the 
time in the postmodern and curriculum,

1333
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:18,253
all the,
all the ways in which we are not 

1334
01:17:19,281 --> 01:17:23,060
entitled to our inheritance.
But I think in the face at that,

1335
01:17:23,061 --> 01:17:27,110
we have to insist on the ways that we 
are entitled to that inheritance.

1336
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,650
If people have died for it,
for,

1337
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:30,753
for our sake,
know that isn't a fantastic title that 

1338
01:17:34,131 --> 01:17:38,330
we enjoy and we should feel grateful to 
them for that.

1339
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:39,373
I mean,
when it comes to actual works of art or 

1340
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:48,410
whatever,
which have opened the sense of the depth

1341
01:17:48,411 --> 01:17:49,244
of one's own inheritance.
That I think is a very interesting 

1342
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:55,520
question.
There's so many of them,

1343
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:58,820
but,
but just to mention only one,

1344
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:03,080
I'm the Bach B minor mass.
To me,

1345
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:05,090
that's a door into the,
into the,

1346
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:07,790
the whole,
uh,

1347
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:12,680
the whole European inheritance going 
back to the crucifixion.

1348
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,541
There it is.
There,

1349
01:18:13,541 --> 01:18:14,374
it all is encapsulated in music,
music of celebrating the universal 

1350
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:22,940
claims or the Roman Catholic church,
but written by a Protestant,

1351
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:24,450
you know,
that it's,

1352
01:18:24,451 --> 01:18:28,610
um,
and offered as a gift to mankind,

1353
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:33,580
narratives and those such things.
So transcend any,

1354
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,950
any minor historical details,
uh,

1355
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:41,030
that to unrecognized is that,
that is what the past really is for one,

1356
01:18:41,031 --> 01:18:43,220
that great depth of,
uh,

1357
01:18:43,221 --> 01:18:47,060
of inheritance that can't be enumerated,
but just enjoy it.

1358
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:49,590
Just to follow up before we turn to 
Jordan.

1359
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:50,973
Roger,
at the beginning you talked about how 

1360
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:53,613
great literature,
great writing is writing in which the 

1361
01:18:56,231 --> 01:19:00,250
reader finds himself,
finds herself.

1362
01:19:00,730 --> 01:19:05,660
I'm taking box mass in b minor.
Um,

1363
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:08,680
you've,
you've spoken about the unfolding of the

1364
01:19:08,681 --> 01:19:13,600
self that is found in these great works 
are the reflection of the self,

1365
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:17,890
I know,
or at least I think you've written about

1366
01:19:17,891 --> 01:19:20,040
the unfolding of the theme,
uh,

1367
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:20,890
in,
in,

1368
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:23,440
in,
in of that mass in particular,

1369
01:19:23,441 --> 01:19:25,360
but certainly in other,
other of your writings,

1370
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:30,130
the unfolding of the theme and music.
Could you say something about the.

1371
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:31,793
I know that's a huge question,
but the way in which the unfolding of 

1372
01:19:36,041 --> 01:19:40,540
the theme in music is an unfolding of 
the self.

1373
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:42,950
So really,
um,

1374
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:44,483
provocative way of putting it.
It is true that when you listen to a 

1375
01:19:48,061 --> 01:19:49,730
theme,
uh,

1376
01:19:50,130 --> 01:19:50,963
in music,
you are not listening to a sequence of 

1377
01:19:53,401 --> 01:19:54,234
notes.
Something begins in that first note and 

1378
01:19:57,921 --> 01:20:02,640
injures to the final node and it goes on
all the way through,

1379
01:20:02,641 --> 01:20:03,474
even though there are spells of silence,
it's still going on in the silence so 

1380
01:20:07,621 --> 01:20:08,454
that our ability to hear something as a 
theme is already a contribution that we 

1381
01:20:14,281 --> 01:20:16,200
make.
It comes out of us.

1382
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:19,440
So we've identified with that movement.
That movement is,

1383
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:21,960
it's there in the world because it's 
there in us,

1384
01:20:22,370 --> 01:20:24,660
but,
but in so many ways,

1385
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:29,840
all our inner life is interrupted and 
unfulfilled and it's full of things that

1386
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,650
start up.
And then Peter around,

1387
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:35,883
uh,
and I think that is one of the 

1388
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:38,213
fundamental experiences of human beings,
that there's an inner disorder that 

1389
01:20:41,161 --> 01:20:43,500
things never actually come to a 
conclusion.

1390
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:48,470
But here uniquely movements begin and 
come to a conclusion.

1391
01:20:48,471 --> 01:20:50,940
This is a.
and that conclusion is,

1392
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:54,050
is complete,
is that satisfaction of,

1393
01:20:54,051 --> 01:20:54,521
of,
uh,

1394
01:20:54,521 --> 01:20:55,440
of the,
uh,

1395
01:20:55,890 --> 01:20:56,723
um,
unsaturated nature of the movement of 

1396
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,190
the first beginning,
the,

1397
01:21:01,410 --> 01:21:03,390
uh,
and it's an,

1398
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:04,370
an experience.
What,

1399
01:21:04,370 --> 01:21:06,710
why do we value that?
I think we value,

1400
01:21:06,711 --> 01:21:07,544
I value it in the same way as you battle
your tragedy because it gives 

1401
01:21:10,710 --> 01:21:11,543
completion.
And closure to things that otherwise 

1402
01:21:14,281 --> 01:21:15,420
wouldn't ever have them

1403
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:16,883
and things that are transient as well 
because it does have a beginning and an 

1404
01:21:19,531 --> 01:21:22,830
end and the end doesn't invalidate the 
utility of the,

1405
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:24,690
of the entity.
That's right.

1406
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:27,860
So in the gratitude,
I mean that was the,

1407
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:31,770
that was exactly the theme that sprung 
to mind for me as soon as you asked that

1408
01:21:31,771 --> 01:21:32,604
question.
I mean,

1409
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:37,760
one of the things that I find profoundly
disquieting about the modern radical.

1410
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:39,620
Oh,
uh,

1411
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:42,390
what would you call it?
An ideology that is so.

1412
01:21:42,650 --> 01:21:43,483
No,
so unfortunately dominant on campuses 

1413
01:21:46,381 --> 01:21:49,290
among young people is that it's 
unbelievably ungrateful.

1414
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:50,783
And when I,
when I walk outside and there's not a 

1415
01:21:53,371 --> 01:21:57,450
riot and death in the streets,
I'm having a good day.

1416
01:21:58,020 --> 01:21:58,853
That's my sense of history.
It's like I'm constantly staggered by 

1417
01:22:03,061 --> 01:22:06,210
the fact that so much works all the 
time.

1418
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:07,463
It's absolutely.
I met this guy a while back and he'd 

1419
01:22:10,981 --> 01:22:12,390
been in a motorcycle accident.

1420
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:13,860
He really got hurt,
man.

1421
01:22:13,861 --> 01:22:16,770
He was,
he was pretty much half destroyed and he

1422
01:22:16,771 --> 01:22:17,604
worked as a telephone lineman.
He worked with this guy who had 

1423
01:22:19,741 --> 01:22:20,574
Parkinson's disease who had was equally 
destroyed in a slightly different way 

1424
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:25,373
and the two of them together could climb
up a telephone pole and continue their 

1425
01:22:28,021 --> 01:22:28,854
job,
and I thought this unbelievable 

1426
01:22:30,331 --> 01:22:31,164
infrastructure we have that is just an 
absolute bloody ongoing ongoing miracle 

1427
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:38,220
is sustained by people exactly like 
that.

1428
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:39,083
You know,
they're having very difficult lives and 

1429
01:22:40,951 --> 01:22:41,784
a country like Canada.
They go out in the middle of the bloody 

1430
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:45,023
winter where you die,
it's frigid and something breaks and 

1431
01:22:48,181 --> 01:22:49,014
they fix it and the lights are on.
The lights are on all the time and I 

1432
01:22:51,871 --> 01:22:52,704
come to somewhere like Europe and to me 
it's an absolutely overwhelming 

1433
01:22:58,231 --> 01:23:01,740
experience to see king's chapel today,
to wander around the city.

1434
01:23:01,741 --> 01:23:02,574
I'm just staggered that people produce 
this and so amazed that we could do it 

1435
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:10,450
and so grateful that it exists.

1436
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,383
We're talking about king's chapel.
The people who started didn't live to 

1437
01:23:14,501 --> 01:23:15,910
see its completion.
They were.

1438
01:23:16,150 --> 01:23:16,983
They were driven by this nobility of 
transcendent vision and they produce 

1439
01:23:20,231 --> 01:23:24,850
these enduring forms and out of the 
bloody misery of history.

1440
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:25,833
We've erected all this spectacular 
infrastructure that we're so fortunate 

1441
01:23:30,401 --> 01:23:31,234
to be part of and there none of that 
gratitude is taught and it's partly not 

1442
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:40,261
taught because people have no sense of 
the absolute catastrophe of history.

1443
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:43,900
I mean for me the hobbs.
It's like nasty,

1444
01:23:43,901 --> 01:23:48,901
brutish and short that the simplest and 
most likely social circumstances,

1445
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:50,793
catastrophe punctuated by hell and to 
see that not happening in a sustained 

1446
01:23:55,871 --> 01:23:56,704
manner constantly and to see things 
improving around us and and to be 

1447
01:24:00,551 --> 01:24:03,940
reliable in that manner and then not to 
be grateful for that.

1448
01:24:03,941 --> 01:24:04,774
It's like it's an unbelievable 
combination of ignorance and willful 

1449
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:08,193
ignorance in gratitude and willful 
blindness and it does no one soul any 

1450
01:24:11,501 --> 01:24:14,650
good.
It's so good to walk down the streets of

1451
01:24:14,651 --> 01:24:18,730
a beautiful town like this and to be 
open mouth in northern Iran,

1452
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:24,000
amazement at what's here and so and to 
not instill that sense and young people,

1453
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:26,403
for them to understand that they are 
standing on the bones of generations of 

1454
01:24:30,431 --> 01:24:31,264
people who suffered to make this 
possible despite all their errors and 

1455
01:24:34,031 --> 01:24:35,710
have brought this forward.
It's like,

1456
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:37,783
yeah,
Whoa,

1457
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:41,210
whoa.
This is a very a salutary lesson.

1458
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:42,073
Actually,
because he did look into the abyss and 

1459
01:24:44,630 --> 01:24:49,630
stepped back from it and reported on it
and as did shows,

1460
01:24:50,570 --> 01:24:51,403
it's in and um,
we postwar baby boomers to haven't had 

1461
01:24:57,741 --> 01:24:58,574
that experience.
I had a little glimpse of it in the old 

1462
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:03,830
communist days,
but we only saw the edge of it then,

1463
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:05,143
you know,
um,

1464
01:25:05,210 --> 01:25:06,043
but,
uh,

1465
01:25:07,010 --> 01:25:08,870
still the sense,
the sense that it is,

1466
01:25:08,871 --> 01:25:11,800
they're always beneath your feet and 
the,

1467
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:16,900
and the crust is thin as it can be in 
certain places.

1468
01:25:16,941 --> 01:25:17,774
That I think is something that young 
people do need to be taught without 

1469
01:25:20,481 --> 01:25:25,250
making them get gloomy about it,
but to recognize that they're lucky.

1470
01:25:25,251 --> 01:25:26,084
Okay.

1471
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:30,130
Last question before we open up for a 
few questions here.

1472
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:35,140
It seems to me that the backward looking
that we've talked about,

1473
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:35,993
or you had a wonderful phrase,
a wide eyed open mouthed at non-ironic 

1474
01:25:39,650 --> 01:25:40,483
in amazement,
I think you said walking around this 

1475
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:46,450
transcendently beautiful town of 
Cambridge,

1476
01:25:46,451 --> 01:25:50,650
which houses this August and ancient and
beautiful institution.

1477
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:53,270
I'm
with.

1478
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,273
You mentioned Jordan.
We're seeing the king's chapel earlier 

1479
01:25:56,770 --> 01:25:57,603
today,
that those who started the work knew 

1480
01:26:01,181 --> 01:26:02,014
they wouldn't be those who would finish.
And those who finished knew they had 

1481
01:26:04,341 --> 01:26:07,700
inherited to work,
they had not themselves begun.

1482
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:10,580
And so I suppose I want to ask,
um,

1483
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:11,630
we've talked about the,
the,

1484
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:12,473
the,
the necessity to turn back with 

1485
01:26:13,761 --> 01:26:17,650
gratitude to the past,
to our inherited a past.

1486
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:20,060
I want to talk also about the 
possibility of,

1487
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:22,650
of building and a creation.
Uh,

1488
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:25,670
these chapels and buildings were built 
at some time.

1489
01:26:25,670 --> 01:26:27,500
You,
yourself are a composer.

1490
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:30,890
Both of you are authors of books that 
many,

1491
01:26:30,891 --> 01:26:32,570
many people have,
uh,

1492
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:35,660
found depth and truth in.
So I want to,

1493
01:26:35,661 --> 01:26:37,340
uh,
to ask about,

1494
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,830
uh,
the possibilities for,

1495
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:41,660
for,
for renaissance,

1496
01:26:41,690 --> 01:26:46,690
for rebuilding or building a new and new
buildings and new forms of community,

1497
01:26:48,591 --> 01:26:49,424
new forms of art.
Perhaps new buildings have old forms of 

1498
01:26:51,891 --> 01:26:54,740
architecture,
new colleges and universities,

1499
01:26:54,990 --> 01:26:59,360
a new,
more healthy and beautiful forms of,

1500
01:26:59,630 --> 01:27:00,463
of courtship,
new forms of a flourishing arts and 

1501
01:27:03,861 --> 01:27:05,060
music.
Uh,

1502
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:06,883
it seems to me so important that,
that we not lose sight of the fact that 

1503
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:15,160
precisely the abiding truth of the 
transcendent in us,

1504
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:20,780
it gives us hope to,
to answer that call.

1505
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,070
Yeah.
It must be the case that when,

1506
01:27:24,370 --> 01:27:27,850
when describing our cultural 
inheritance,

1507
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:31,120
we're not just describing something 
that's gone,

1508
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:36,310
we must be describing something of which
we are still a part a and which,

1509
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:40,450
which has to changed as we are changing 
to accommodate us.

1510
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:44,800
And all this was said by Elliot in 
tradition and the individual talent,

1511
01:27:44,801 --> 01:27:45,311
you know,
that,

1512
01:27:45,311 --> 01:27:46,144
um,
that the artist must be constantly 

1513
01:27:48,941 --> 01:27:53,380
trying to say that new thing that he 
came into the world to say,

1514
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:57,820
but he can only say it if he adapts his 
style to the,

1515
01:27:58,420 --> 01:27:59,253
the inheritance of the tradition,
thereby transforming the tradition and 

1516
01:28:03,041 --> 01:28:03,874
transforming himself.
And we all were there and there is no 

1517
01:28:06,911 --> 01:28:07,744
formula for doing this because the 
formula is precisely what destroys the 

1518
01:28:10,931 --> 01:28:11,764
creative act.
But we have to assume that new things 

1519
01:28:16,961 --> 01:28:19,750
will come and they will come through,
uh,

1520
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:20,673
as,
as they always did in the past through 

1521
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:27,840
fasting and prayer
and the occasional glass of wine.

1522
01:28:28,530 --> 01:28:29,363
My kids,

1523
01:28:32,290 --> 01:28:34,660
Jordan.
Well,

1524
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:36,880
we could concentrate,
I suppose,

1525
01:28:36,910 --> 01:28:40,030
on building the future instead of 
criticizing the past.

1526
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:41,613
I mean,
it's necessary to decompose to 

1527
01:28:43,901 --> 01:28:47,410
reconstruct those.
Those acts can't be separated,

1528
01:28:47,411 --> 01:28:48,244
but the decomposition is the 
prerequisite for the reconstruction and 

1529
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:52,763
you know what I've been recommending to 
people is that they start on whatever 

1530
01:28:56,321 --> 01:28:57,154
scale they can start on with whatever's 
in front of them because they have more 

1531
01:28:59,771 --> 01:29:01,920
in front of them.
Then they think these,

1532
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:02,993
these,
these,

1533
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:03,833
these circumscribed areas that these 
small places that people can call their 

1534
01:29:06,991 --> 01:29:08,790
own,
even if it's only their room,

1535
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:11,970
you can start to do something creative 
and beautiful there.

1536
01:29:11,971 --> 01:29:14,550
I mean,
I've suggested to people that they start

1537
01:29:14,551 --> 01:29:17,610
by putting the room in order and that 
that implies a purpose.

1538
01:29:17,611 --> 01:29:18,420
It's like,
well,

1539
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,360
your room is somewhere that you exist.
It's,

1540
01:29:20,361 --> 01:29:22,140
it's,
it's a place that surrounds you,

1541
01:29:22,141 --> 01:29:22,974
that tells you how to be is put it in 
order so at least it isn't screaming 

1542
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:30,720
chaos at you in a soul destroying 
manner.

1543
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:32,770
Make it pristine and,
and,

1544
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:33,703
and,
and orderly and in a fashion that suits 

1545
01:29:35,641 --> 01:29:36,474
what you're aiming at.
So have an aim and then this is perhaps 

1546
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:41,190
a chapter in my next book.
Well,

1547
01:29:41,191 --> 01:29:45,060
maybe you start by putting your room in 
order and then you make it beautiful and

1548
01:29:45,061 --> 01:29:45,894
then you learn how to make something 
beautiful and to make something 

1549
01:29:47,821 --> 01:29:51,600
beautiful is to make it worthwhile and 
to participate in that transcendent,

1550
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:54,120
in that transcendence.
Maybe you need one

1551
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:58,980
certainly and for your future self,
which is also others.

1552
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,960
You know,
this idea that people are fat even of,

1553
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:02,670
of,
of,

1554
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:03,503
of self gratification.
Let's say as an antidote to nihilism 

1555
01:30:06,331 --> 01:30:07,164
will take your pleasure in the moment.
It doesn't even work for you because 

1556
01:30:10,201 --> 01:30:11,034
you're stuck with you tomorrow and you 
next week and so even to treat yourself 

1557
01:30:14,851 --> 01:30:17,850
properly is to treat yourself as part of
an ongoing community.

1558
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:22,500
But I would say start by you start in 
the world.

1559
01:30:22,770 --> 01:30:23,603
If you have some wisdom and some 
humility by taking the potential that 

1560
01:30:29,161 --> 01:30:29,994
lies dormant in front of you and 
interacting with it in the logos like 

1561
01:30:34,861 --> 01:30:35,694
manner with truth and with love,
and by transforming that potential into 

1562
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:43,710
whatever you can create out of it,
that's good and and even if it's,

1563
01:30:43,770 --> 01:30:45,810
it won't be small.
If you do that,

1564
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:48,810
you can transform your whole household 
by transforming your room.

1565
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,793
You can transform your whole 
neighborhood by transforming your house 

1566
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:52,903
like these things spread very,
very rapidly and that is right there in 

1567
01:30:55,921 --> 01:30:57,270
front of you.
You know,

1568
01:30:57,271 --> 01:31:01,560
and people think they're impoverished 
now that they don't have any opportunity

1569
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:04,560
and that opportunity is hidden from them
by their,

1570
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:07,800
by their,
by their unwillingness to take the steps

1571
01:31:07,801 --> 01:31:12,330
that are necessary to put what they 
could put in front of them in order and,

1572
01:31:12,331 --> 01:31:13,530
and,
and to,

1573
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:16,770
and to produce the beauty instead of the
ugliness where they could do that.

1574
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:20,550
And I don't think there is anything more
powerful than that that works.

1575
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:23,250
I've had thousands of people tell me 
that it works.

1576
01:31:23,251 --> 01:31:25,770
You know,
personally come and talk to me every day

1577
01:31:25,771 --> 01:31:28,950
now on the street and say,
my life was in terrible disorder.

1578
01:31:28,951 --> 01:31:31,620
I had no vision.
I wasn't abiding by the truth.

1579
01:31:31,621 --> 01:31:32,454
My relationships were fragmented.
I've decided to make something of 

1580
01:31:35,551 --> 01:31:37,140
myself,
whatever that might be.

1581
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:38,093
I've decided to adopt more 
responsibility to tell the truth and 

1582
01:31:40,321 --> 01:31:44,520
things are in comparatively better.
And so that's,

1583
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:48,360
that's there for everyone to take,
and regardless of your circumstances,

1584
01:31:48,361 --> 01:31:49,194
and I know that some people have what 
appeared to be larger opportunities and 

1585
01:31:53,071 --> 01:31:53,904
more privileged in front of them,
but that also makes their commensurate 

1586
01:31:56,581 --> 01:32:00,400
moral responsibility larger.
So there's certain balancing

1587
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,233
that's a natural consequence of that.
So now recognizing the nature of the 

1588
01:32:05,681 --> 01:32:06,514
finite,
there's a train one of us needs to 

1589
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:09,124
catch,
are going to have to draw this 

1590
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,500
conversation to a close,
but not before.

1591
01:32:11,501 --> 01:32:12,334
We've all had a chance to thank both of 
you for everything you do to fan the 

1592
01:32:17,561 --> 01:32:20,080
flames of the transcendent for your 
readers,

1593
01:32:20,110 --> 01:32:21,910
for your listeners,
for all of us.

1594
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:23,380
Thank you very much.
Both of you.
