1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,773
So,
um,

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,350
I wanted to take another look at this 
figure to begin with.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,063
No,

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,403
what are the reasons that I
began to think about these sorts of 

5
00:00:19,271 --> 00:00:20,104
things just because I wanted to 
understand what it might mean to have a 

6
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:28,990
set of,
let's say,

7
00:00:28,991 --> 00:00:33,970
a set of values and beliefs because 
those two things go together.

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,010
That would,
I guess part of the question was,

9
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:39,844
is it possible to develop a system of 
belief that's outside of the realm of 

10
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,603
videology no,
because one thing you might claim is 

11
00:00:46,901 --> 00:00:47,734
that,

12
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,150
yeah,
it's all ideology and belief system is,

13
00:00:53,151 --> 00:00:53,984
it is ideological and if you develop a 
belief system that criticizes other 

14
00:00:58,561 --> 00:00:59,394
belief systems,
it just means that you've developed a 

15
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:06,111
new ideological stance and there's some.
That's a good argument.

16
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:07,974
You know,
I can think of a number of ways that 

17
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:11,424
it's true.
One of the things neat you said in the 

18
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:19,290
late 18 hundreds was that if you 
inhabited the belief system,

19
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:23,010
even a religious system and you lost 
faith in it,

20
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,580
not only did you lose faith in that 
system,

21
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:30,960
but you also potentially lost faith in 
systems themselves.

22
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,970
And so it was a medical apps in a sense,
not only did you lose your belief,

23
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:39,870
but you lost your belief in belief so 
you can think of the set of all possible

24
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:44,720
beliefs and then abandoning any hope of 
relying on noses,

25
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,530
valid sources of information

26
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,733
so

27
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,280
you know,
so that's one perspective and it's a,

28
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,193
it's a powerful one and we need you to 
believe that that was a certain pathway 

29
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,813
denialism essentially,
or perhaps to a reactionary 

30
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:04,720
totalitarianism,
but it boils down to the same thing.

31
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,730
I'd been reading this book
recently,

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,820
which the title of,
I can't remember unfortunately,

33
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,940
but I'll tell it to you after class.
It's a.

34
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:23,260
it's a critique of certain lines of left
wing ideological thinking,

35
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:29,170
including the existential thought.
If people like John Paul Sartre and food

36
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:30,514
co and one of the most trenchant 
critiques of Sartre because he believes 

37
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:39,050
that you sort of have an absolute 
freedom that you're destined for freedom

38
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,710
that you're doing to it.
In some sense,

39
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,030
part of your existential
journey is to establish an authenticity.

40
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:52,340
That's correct for you,
but he doesn't.

41
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,733
He isn't able really to give any 
description of what that should be 

42
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,613
grounded in and the critic
concludes that all Sartre can do is 

43
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:12,211
stand outside of any potential belief 
system and criticize it and that that's,

44
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,930
there's nothing in it for anyone as a 
consequence of that.

45
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:19,780
It's,
it's only destructive now.

46
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,530
It's important to remember with regards 
to Sartre that he viewed other people to

47
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:28,180
some degree,
like the common man,

48
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:29,014
the bourgeoisie we might say as the 
embodiment of non freedom of 

49
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,133
inauthenticity and also as a barrier to 
genuine authenticity so he wasn't 

50
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,420
willing to give any credence to the 
utility of normality,

51
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,273
but I also think he wasn't able to 
tolerate the consequences of his own 

52
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:48,694
thought because he was a avid supporter 
of the communist party far after anyone 

53
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:56,800
with any reasonable moral sense would 
have stopped doing that.

54
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:57,634
So sergeant really didn't denounce the 
communists until the end of the 

55
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,621
beginning of the seventies.
Roughly speaking.

56
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:05,020
It was never a card carrying communist,
but he was a very.

57
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,210
It was very left leaning and you know,
by,

58
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,910
by the 19 seventies,
by the late sixties,

59
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,160
by the,
by the early seventies,

60
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,623
a lot of the evidence about what was 
going on in Soviet Russia had been in 

61
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:18,970
for 30 years.

62
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,073
So there is really no excuse for not 
facing up to that and trying to 

63
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:28,540
understand what it meant and it would be
bad enough if it was just Soviet Union,

64
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,820
but it wasn't the same sort of thing 
happened.

65
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,300
Wherever those utopian pre a precept 
positions were put into place.

66
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:40,210
And I suppose many of you don't know 
this,

67
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:43,390
but Paul Paul,
who was the Cambodian dictator,

68
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:47,260
was educated at this sort of bomb.
And he wrote his thesis on the.

69
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,430
He wrote his,
I think it was his phd thesis,

70
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,460
although it might've been his master's 
thesis on the Marxist doctrine that the,

71
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,223
that uh,
urban people were parasites on rural 

72
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:04,950
people.
So you know,

73
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,793
there's a theory that says that the 
genuine value this is generated purely 

74
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:10,654
by labor and much of that rural labor 
and the city's siphon off the excess 

75
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:17,520
productive power and are able to Paris 
the ties,

76
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,660
the countryside as a consequence of that
and which is an,

77
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,470
you know,
tremendously

78
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:30,400
nonproductive theory,
but Pol Pot put it into practice.

79
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,233
And so when he went back into Cambodia,
he chased everybody out of the cities 

80
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:37,120
and killed about 6 million people.
So,

81
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,220
you know,
you can read about that if you want.

82
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:43,000
It's a pretty appalling section of,
of 20th century history,

83
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,863
you know,
especially when it's the case that he 

84
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:46,084
was in.
He was educated in the west and had 

85
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:53,710
these presuppositions drummed into them.
And then there's fruit,

86
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:54,544
Cole Cole,
who I have no respect for it by the way 

87
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,463
I think.
I think I've read a fair bit of foot 

88
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:03,224
cool.
And I think everything he says is 

89
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:06,200
obvious.
So for example,

90
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:09,590
he criticizes the idea of mental illness
as a,

91
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,050
as a social construct.
It's like,

92
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,150
well,
yeah,

93
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,193
obviously,
I mean it's not like psychiatrists and 

94
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,944
psychologists and mental health 
professionals who are relatively well 

95
00:06:21,191 --> 00:06:22,024
informed,
haven't known about that since for the 

96
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:24,524
last 60 years.
I mean it might be a revelation to 

97
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:32,921
people who who don't notice that psyche 
psychiatry for example,

98
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:34,364
is something like a compromise between 
the patient biology and the social 

99
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:39,014
world.

100
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,003
You know what I mean?
Psychiatric ailments often have a 

101
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:43,874
biological tilt,
but the way they manifest themselves in 

102
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:51,731
society is clearly conditioned in very 
intense ways by the particular

103
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:54,763
conditions.
Obtaining at the point that the person 

104
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:57,554
who has that biological predisposition 
exists even whether or not that's 

105
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:01,454
pathological can be tilted one way or 
another by the by cultural norms and 

106
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:09,170
then of course when you're dealing with 
issues like insurance,

107
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:11,570
payment and treatment and 
hospitalization,

108
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,583
obviously you're pulling in all sorts of
systems that are by no means purely 

109
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:17,264
scientific,
but I don't find it particularly useful 

110
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:23,510
critique.
It's obvious as far as I'm concerned,

111
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,030
and the other thing that code did,
I mean I think this is the typical,

112
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,680
especially the French intellectuals,
typical sleight of hand.

113
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:35,570
Once Marxism became,
you know,

114
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,523
once you were no longer able to call 
yourself a committed Marxist because 

115
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,780
committed Marxism had led to 
unbelievable brutality,

116
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,500
you know,
on a scale that had never probably,

117
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:51,860
I think never been experienced in the 
entire history of the planet,

118
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:55,010
at least in terms of its reach and 
duration.

119
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,920
You didn't get to call yourself a 
Marxist anymore,

120
00:07:57,921 --> 00:08:00,410
although there were still people and you
still see them saying,

121
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:02,240
well,
that wasn't real Marxism.

122
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,710
Which I think is a combo of staggering 
proportions.

123
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:08,090
That usually means,
well,

124
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:10,850
if I was the person running the country,
that wouldn't have happened.

125
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,340
You know,
that's the logic behind it.

126
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,130
They didn't put the principles into 
practice properly.

127
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:16,611
It's like,
yeah,

128
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:17,444
well lots of people put the damn 
principles into practice and the same 

129
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:20,354
thing happened everywhere.
So at some point you have to kind of 

130
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:24,980
wonder if there's something wrong with 
the principals.

131
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,293
Anyways,
what I did was take the Marxist 

132
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,823
presupposition that everything was,
could be boiled down to economics and 

133
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:35,803
economic power and translated it into 
the idea that everything just boiled 

134
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:40,820
down to power.
You know,

135
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,673
and the reason that we have institutions
is to include and to exclude and that 

136
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,060
the institutions always run for the 
benefit of those at the top.

137
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,893
It's like,
well,

138
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,030
yeah,
that's a little bit true,

139
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,380
but it's,
you know,

140
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:55,214
it's,
it's a scientist would look at that and 

141
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:57,181
say,
yeah,

142
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:58,270
well probably,
you know,

143
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,513
power dynamics in a,
in a functioning economic and political 

144
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:03,774
system,
maybe account for 10 percent of the 

145
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,180
variance,
something like that,

146
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,190
maybe 15 percent.
So for example,

147
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,930
if you have a say you want to go to an 
ivy league school,

148
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,780
while if your parents went to the 
school,

149
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:16,614
you're more likely to get in,
but you're not that much more likely to 

150
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:21,210
get in and you still have to be,
you know,

151
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:22,044
roughly speaking,
what happens is that if you have a 

152
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:26,310
pretty decent,
you know,

153
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:31,340
high school gpa and you do very well on 
the sats and you have some other talents

154
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,480
of some sort because that's also 
necessary,

155
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,680
then they might pick you over someone 
else who's roughly will you qualify it.

156
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,530
If you have a familial history of 
attendance at school.

157
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,680
So obviously you get an exact end an 
advantage,

158
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:44,514
but it's not.
It's not the kind of advantage that 

159
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:52,290
accounts for the entirety of how the 
system is structured.

160
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,480
It's an advantage.
While you can say,

161
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:55,710
well that's not fair.
It's like,

162
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,544
yeah,
okay,

163
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,103
fair enough.
Most systems are certainly not 100 

164
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:05,670
percent either.
Fair or just definitely not,

165
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:11,310
but you know,
instead of comparing them to utopia,

166
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,380
you might compare them to another 
system,

167
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,690
which is the only reasonable way to do 
it.

168
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,230
It's like everything looks terrible when
you compare it to the best thing you can

169
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:20,064
possibly imagine,
but the best thing you can possibly 

170
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:23,184
imagine is it's an empty fiction because
it's so devoid of detailed content that 

171
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:31,680
you can't use it as a guide to reality.
Now,

172
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:32,514
I mean the idea that things could be 
better has its roots in some sense in a 

173
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:41,760
broad scale Utopian project and I 
believe that things could be better,

174
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:45,900
but that doesn't mean that when you're 
doing an analysis of a complex system,

175
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:49,960
you get to compare it to an ideological 
utopia and then describe all the reasons

176
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:50,880
that it's bad.

177
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,703
It's not

178
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,280
appropriate to do that.
It's too simplistic.

179
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,114
You're not going to do anything to 
actually address the problems that the 

180
00:11:00,821 --> 00:11:04,660
system has.
If you take that approach.

181
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:05,494
And then of course like pure utopian 
thinking is extraordinarily dangerous 

182
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:14,791
because if you think that your way of 
molding society into some ultimate state

183
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:22,060
of perfection is headed towards some 
ultimate state of perfection,

184
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,253
then you can justify absolutely anything
you do right now on the basis of the 

185
00:11:27,071 --> 00:11:30,010
fact that things are going to improve so
radically in the future.

186
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,680
And that means any of your behaviors are
excused.

187
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,200
The end is worth it.
Well,

188
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,130
if someone says that you have to kind of
wonder what there are actually planning.

189
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,100
Oh,
excuse me,

190
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,960
what they're actually planning to do.
So.

191
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,491
Okay,
so,

192
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:52,540
well,
what's the issue?

193
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,890
Well,
the is that it's

194
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,610
so the same critic with regards to Food 
Co.

195
00:11:58,611 --> 00:12:00,610
He said,
you know what's basically the same thing

196
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:05,611
that food,
coal criticized a variety of low,

197
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,050
you know,
profound institutions,

198
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,633
sexual institutions say like marriage 
and then institutions of power like 

199
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:16,150
prisons and institutions of,
um,

200
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,470
mental health,
you know,

201
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:22,120
the whole institutional framework.
He criticized them on the basis of power

202
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:26,470
and exclusion and you could do that and 
there's some truth in it,

203
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,300
but you know,
food,

204
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:29,134
coal also made the presupposition.
The problem with that presupposition is 

205
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:32,944
that everything is about something else 
is that it's almost impossible to see 

206
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:37,654
how it can be applied to fukiko himself.
So you'd have to ask if you were a 

207
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:42,364
student of flute coal,
what power aims drove his attempt to 

208
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:47,914
analyze everything in terms of power.
and I actually think with code it's 

209
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:52,330
pretty obvious.

210
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,523
So,
but it's a game that never goes 

211
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:57,790
anywhere.
Okay.

212
00:12:57,791 --> 00:12:58,624
So I thought about that a lot is like is
there any system that you can develop 

213
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:03,843
that doesn't have the negative 
consequences of systems in general and 

214
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:11,230
then if that is possible,
how and why might it be possible?

215
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,680
And this is partly why I'm talking to 
you about this particular diagram again,

216
00:13:17,961 --> 00:13:18,794
and I think the reason now I don't know 
this and you guys can think it through 

217
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,080
yourself.
I mean,

218
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,820
lots of people have talked to me about 
the content of this course and you know,

219
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,693
they've said that it's been very helpful
for them when it comes to interpreting 

220
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:34,000
certain elements of their life,
you know,

221
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,310
but some people have said,
well,

222
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:41,311
it's just another system and
I don't believe that.

223
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,543
I think it's a medical system and I 
don't think the rules that apply to 

224
00:13:44,951 --> 00:13:48,690
systems also apply to medical systems,
but you know,

225
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,980
that could just be me.

226
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,113
So you,
you're going to have to decide that for 

227
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:54,244
yourself.
But I think the reason that I can make 

228
00:13:56,291 --> 00:14:00,550
that claim and that it's a valid claim 
is because first of all,

229
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:02,620
I don't believe it's an intellectual 
system.

230
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,203
I don't think it's an attempt to reduce 
a complex set of phenomena to something 

231
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:08,644
that is
what dispenses with important elements 

232
00:14:14,381 --> 00:14:17,170
of their,
of their existence.

233
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,813
So for example,
let me give you an example of how that 

234
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:21,274
sort of thing happens.
Like if you're looking at the world 

235
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,064
through a biased lands,
what it means is you take nonrandom 

236
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,443
samples of the environmental data.
So I can give you a quick example of 

237
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:37,360
something I saw that I thought was very 
particular in that regard.

238
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,730
I don't think I've used this example 
before,

239
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:40,564
but about 10 years ago or there abouts,
naomi klein made a documentary about 

240
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:46,054
this factory down in south America,
I believe it was in Argentina and this 

241
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:50,644
was just after all the foreign capital 
fled to Argentina and the economy 

242
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:55,874
collapsed completely,
which is something that happens to 

243
00:14:57,081 --> 00:14:58,970
Argentina fairly regularly by the way.

244
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,950
And she went down there to this factory 
where there were working man,

245
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,143
um,
and they had been building heavy 

246
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:07,630
machinery and the working men decided 
that they were going to.

247
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,483
This factory had been padlocked and they
had been locked out because things had 

248
00:15:11,631 --> 00:15:12,464
come to a halt and they decided that 
they were going to take the chains off 

249
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,030
the factory gate and go in there and 
start making heavy machinery again.

250
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,400
You know,
it's a very cool documentary as far as I

251
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:23,234
was concerned.
She went down there and she interviewed 

252
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,124
all these working guys and you know,
they talked about how their lives have 

253
00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:31,340
been brought to a halt by the factory 
closure and and obviously it sucked that

254
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:32,174
they were sitting around doing nothing 
and not being paid for anything when 

255
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:37,880
they could have been inside the factory 
building heavy machinery,

256
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:39,260
which is what they wanted to do.

257
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,513
So she went down there and laid out 
their story and it was very sympathetic 

258
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:46,010
to the workers and good,
you know,

259
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,150
fair enough,
good.

260
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,410
But then she went and interviewed the 
guy who owned the factory and she didn't

261
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:53,210
ask him any real questions,
you know,

262
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:56,660
because what she had she did instead was
caricaturizing him.

263
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,570
even a priority is sort of,
you know,

264
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,150
a fascist,
a capitalist,

265
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,320
sort of like the millionaire in a 
monopoly and,

266
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,860
and never tried to get beneath the 
superficial a priority categorization to

267
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:16,970
find out what the hell he actually 
thought.

268
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,800
And I was just waiting.
I thought,

269
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:19,940
okay,
well this is cool.

270
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:21,950
What the hell does the factory owner 
have to say?

271
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:23,630
It's like,
where does money go?

272
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,910
why does he think he has a right to the 
factory?

273
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:27,560
Like what are his conditions of 
ownership?

274
00:16:27,561 --> 00:16:29,990
Did he earn the money with video 
inherited?

275
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,153
It's like,
what does he think about the fact that 

276
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:35,120
Argentina is gone to me is collapsed?
What does he.

277
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,730
How does he feel about the fact that all
these workers are out of work?

278
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,700
What does he think about the fact that 
they opened up the factory again,

279
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,820
like there's a lot of interesting things
to ask this guy.

280
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,980
None of them,
none of it had.

281
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,520
And so to me what happened was that she 
was like someone with neglect,

282
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,450
you know,
where she was looking at the world,

283
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:54,284
but you could only see half of 
everything and the half she saw was 

284
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:57,344
probably perfectly no justifiable had 
it's had its proper domain of 

285
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:06,830
application,
but the half she missed.

286
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:09,170
it's like,
well what about that part of the story?

287
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,213
You're going to reduce that to.
You're going to reduce that too cliche 

288
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:15,350
and stereotype and expand up the rest of
the story.

289
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:16,723
Well,
the only reason you do that is if you 

290
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:20,000
didn't want to find out what the hell 
was going on.

291
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:23,600
If you all wanted to do is gather 
evidence that would support your initial

292
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:24,434
theory.

293
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,863
No,
I know perfectly well that there's 

294
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,840
plenty of situations where workers,
the conditions of workers are absolutely

295
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:33,674
abysmal.
I mean,

296
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,233
one of the books I've read this I think 
are remarkable documentation of that 

297
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:41,720
fact is a book by george orwell called 
road to wigan pier,

298
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:46,440
which is a study of the conditions that 
coal miners lived in in 19 thirties in,

299
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,510
in,
in britain,

300
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:49,270
and you know,
it's bloody dismal.

301
00:17:49,271 --> 00:17:51,540
One,
the idea that they were exploited,

302
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,030
it's.
Well that's a tougher one because

303
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,680
the industrial revolution was very,
very hard on people and it was really,

304
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,890
really hard on some people,
you know,

305
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:08,930
particularly on some people,
whether that was because of exploitation

306
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:09,894
or because of the existence of absolute 
poverty is not all that obvious and you 

307
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:16,860
know,
so it's a complicated.

308
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,723
It's a complicated issue now.
There's lots of times when workers were 

309
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:21,834
clearly exploited,
but I think there were times as well 

310
00:18:24,631 --> 00:18:27,560
when they work anyways.
It's a great book and you know,

311
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,453
he does a lovely job of laying out a 
rationale for why the workers should be 

312
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:36,210
treated far better than they were 
treated and so fine.

313
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,110
Good.
Wonderful.

314
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,103
There's something to be said,
but the thing is when you want to say 

315
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:44,604
something,
you want to take an unbiased sample if 

316
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:47,094
you can.
And so this is why I like this 

317
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,410
particular motive conceptualization and 
I think it's the reason I think it's not

318
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:53,244
an intellectual construction is because 
I think it emerges naturally out of the 

319
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:01,830
structure of mythology and narrative and
you can think this through yourself,

320
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,693
but as far as I've been able to tell 
narratives that present themselves in 

321
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:08,274
terms of archetypal characters.
And the thing about a comprehensive 

322
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:15,720
narrative is it can't leave out an 
archetypal character or it failed.

323
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,240
Now I can give you an example of this.
Okay?

324
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,560
So how many of you have seen disney 
sleeping beauty?

325
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:24,720
Okay.
So,

326
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,350
so many of you have.
How many it.

327
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,051
Okay,
so,

328
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:30,120
so there's a few that happened while the
disney movies,

329
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:30,954
you know,
they're kind of standard childhood 

330
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,650
affairs now in sleeping beauty.

331
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,483
What happens is that the king and queen 
give birth to a princess after trying 

332
00:19:38,431 --> 00:19:41,570
for a substantial amount of time and you
know,

333
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,413
she arrives healthy and beautiful and 
then they have a christening day and 

334
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:49,260
they invite everybody to it,
but they don't invite maleficent who's a

335
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,810
dark,
which roughly speaking,

336
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:52,651
you know,
like she's,

337
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,810
uh,
she's queen of the underworld that for,

338
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:58,230
for lack of a better word,
she's the negative element of femininity

339
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,933
and they don't invite her to the party.
And so she shows up anyways and says 

340
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:07,160
that because they didn't invite her,
um,

341
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,620
their daughter's going to die when,
when she had 16,

342
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,483
which is roughly the age of let's say,
sexual maturation for a story of that 

343
00:20:15,271 --> 00:20:16,104
sort.
Now there's another little positive 

344
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:24,050
magic female in the story who mitigates 
that death sentence to protracted sleep.

345
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,560
While the idea behind it,
it's a very,

346
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:33,690
very interesting story.

347
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,523
It's an incredible story in a sense 
because what it says is that if your 

348
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,810
parents protect you too much from the 
dark side of life when you're young,

349
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,203
that what will happen when you start to 
on the road to maturity is you'll be so 

350
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:49,444
naive and so fragile that you'll want to
be unconscious instead of paying 

351
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:54,634
attention and that you're going to have 
to be rescued from that state by 

352
00:20:58,031 --> 00:20:58,864
something and it could be a prince,
which is one which is how that story 

353
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:02,704
lays itself out.
Or it also could be that symbolically 

354
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:06,754
masculine and exploratory element of 
your own psyche and the stories are 

355
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:10,984
ambivalent about whether it's an 
external event or an intern with and it 

356
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:15,720
doesn't really matter.
You know,

357
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:16,250
the,
the,

358
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,083
the things ended up being the same.
And so that's actually what happens in 

359
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:21,160
this,
in the sleeping beauty story.

360
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,570
You know,
at the end,

361
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:28,260
prince who's also enslaved by this 
terrible negative feminine force manages

362
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:30,514
to escape.
And the maleficent turns into a dragon 

363
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,073
and he has to fight her.
And then he goes and rescues the 

364
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:39,310
princess and she wakes up and the 
kingdoms rejuvenated.

365
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:42,430
And everybody's happy.
It's a classic classic story,

366
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,780
you know,
and it's not.

367
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,490
It's funny because tHe disney movie 
frozen was put forward as a,

368
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,270
in some sense,
as a feminist alternative to the classic

369
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:54,430
fairytales at first of all,
you can't do that.

370
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:57,340
You can't just generate up a fairytale.
You know,

371
00:21:57,341 --> 00:21:59,670
there's recent evidence that some of 
these fairytales,

372
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,663
the ones that the grimm brothers and the
and hans christian andersen collected 

373
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,473
are up to 10,000 years old.
You can't just come up with a counter 

374
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:10,840
fairy tale.
That's just not how it works.

375
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,590
And the way that fairytale is 
structured,

376
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,620
it has nothing to do with,
with the necessity for anyone to rely on

377
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:21,580
anyone else for anything.

378
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,473
It's a complex portrayal of the denied 
dynamic relationship between archetypal 

379
00:22:27,551 --> 00:22:28,660
characters.
And you know,

380
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,523
it's one form of the story.
There's lots of different forms of the 

381
00:22:31,991 --> 00:22:32,824
story.
But what I liked about sleeping beauty 

382
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:36,190
for example,
and mrs,

383
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,940
what's nice about the real fairytales is
that along with the positive,

384
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,190
there is negative and it's real 
negative.

385
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:45,940
Like real fairy tales are terrified.
Like I don't who is it?

386
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,660
Is it in sleeping beauty or in snow 
white?

387
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,320
I don't remember.
In one of the famous grimm fairy tales,

388
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,860
one of the evil sisters ends up dancing 
and red hot shoes until she dies.

389
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,113
You know,
it's,

390
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,500
they're very,
very violent and and unsettling,

391
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,760
and it's because they,
you know,

392
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:05,620
they have the quality of genuine folk 
tales,

393
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:06,454
but the reason for that is because 
they're dealing with real things like 

394
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:11,170
the hansel and gretel is a good example 
of that,

395
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:11,680
right?

396
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,513
Kids are abandoned out in the woods.
They find something that's too good to 

397
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:15,874
be true inside this thing that's too 
good to be true is something that wants 

398
00:23:19,001 --> 00:23:22,000
to fatten them up and devour them.
It's a rough story,

399
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,930
but what it's doing,
the stories,

400
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:26,764
the stories have evolved to represent 
the fundamental dynamic elements of 

401
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:33,060
existence.
If you conceptualize existence in,

402
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,470
in,
in terms of character,

403
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:36,963
and the thing is you have to 
conceptualize existence in terms of 

404
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:40,294
character.
If you're a person because what you do 

405
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:43,504
and existence is act out your character,
so your character is an element of 

406
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:50,300
existence.
Now you might say,

407
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:51,134
well,
that doesn't mean that society has a 

408
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:52,964
character,
but actually it does mean that because 

409
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,740
partly what happens,
like if you're socialized,

410
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:58,603
say into a culture,
the culture exists in the same 

411
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:05,600
relationship to you,
roughly speaking as another person does.

412
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,780
So for example,
if you put money in the bank,

413
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,960
which is in principle a representation 
of your labor.

414
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,980
What you're doing is entering into a 
contract with the broader social world,

415
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:16,814
which is one of promise essentially 
where the future society promises to 

416
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,773
return your value at a future date.
So it's a contractual relationship and 

417
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:29,683
the reason that god,
the father is a very common 

418
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:36,761
representation is because treating the 
they in in heideggerian terms,

419
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,863
the others in heideggerian terms as if 
they're an embodied entity actually 

420
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:44,624
works.
So it's because it is an emergent 

421
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:52,970
property of all over the personalities 
that make it up and so you're.

422
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,480
You're interacting with that emergent 
personality all the time.

423
00:24:56,481 --> 00:24:57,950
You could even say,
for example,

424
00:24:57,951 --> 00:24:58,784
that that's the friday and ied.
It's the thing that the representation 

425
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:06,050
of that inside you is what makes you 
feel guilty.

426
00:25:06,051 --> 00:25:10,880
When you transgress against certain 
moral rules and you might say along with

427
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:11,714
the radical existentialists that that's 
just arbitrary and that you can create 

428
00:25:15,171 --> 00:25:19,100
your own values,
but it's not just arbitrary because it's

429
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:19,934
dependent on the consent of others as 
well as on some internal harmony or 

430
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:24,170
disharmony.

431
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,003
It's not arbitrary and you can't just 
set that up by yourself so you know 

432
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:35,690
these things or these things are 
realities and their deep realities.

433
00:25:35,691 --> 00:25:40,691
Now this particular portrayal indicates 
a kind of balance,

434
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:46,130
so the the fundamental ground of reality
is neither positive nor negative.

435
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:50,330
It's the ground out of which everything 
positive or negative emergence.

436
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,183
So you might think of the fundamental 
ground of reality as that which exists 

437
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:59,660
prior to your encounter with it and we 
have no idea what that is.

438
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:03,740
Now you can think about it as you can 
think about it as

439
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:09,410
people tend to think about what things 
are made of anatomic terms,

440
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,273
but it's not a particularly 
comprehensive way of thinking about it 

441
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:14,384
because what what exists beyond the 
realm of your comprehension is the 

442
00:26:20,841 --> 00:26:21,674
pattern relationship between everything 
and everything and you can't reduce it 

443
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:27,614
to any simple level of analysis because 
you miss all sorts of elements of it 

444
00:26:31,461 --> 00:26:32,810
that are extraordinarily important.

445
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,030
If you do that,
so you can't do that.

446
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:37,680
That's not what experiences made out of 
you know,

447
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,833
or what the ground of experience is made
of it and so it's neutral in some sense 

448
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:46,710
it because it exists beyond your 
encounter with it.

449
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,753
It's the unknown as such,
and the reason that that's often 

450
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:51,294
represented in the form of a predatory 
lizard that has something to offer is 

451
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,693
precisely because of that.
It's like the absolute unknown has the 

452
00:26:59,941 --> 00:27:02,700
capacity to tear you into pieces and 
burn you up,

453
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:03,534
but it also has the possibility of 
rewarding you with everything you could 

454
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:08,094
possibly be rewarded with.
So it's this strange juxtaposition of 

455
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:14,220
potential.
I'd like to think about it as potential,

456
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,543
you know,
because people can get a grip on what 

457
00:27:16,741 --> 00:27:20,310
potential means.
There's potential everywhere,

458
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,950
whatever that is.
You have full potential.

459
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:24,540
Your parents tell you that all the time.

460
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,890
What is that?
Well,

461
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,760
it's the unrealized stuff of your being.
Now.

462
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:34,440
It's a very strange concept,
potential because you can't characterize

463
00:27:34,441 --> 00:27:35,274
it any way that you would characterize 
something that's real because it's not 

464
00:27:39,721 --> 00:27:40,950
real.
It's potential,

465
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,960
but you act like it's real.
You know,

466
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,450
you'll feel guilty that you're not 
living up to your potential.

467
00:27:45,451 --> 00:27:46,284
You're not manifesting your potential.
You want people to interact with you so 

468
00:27:49,891 --> 00:27:52,410
that they allow you to demonstrate your 
potential.

469
00:27:52,411 --> 00:27:56,610
Like you act as if it's a reality.
Continually.

470
00:27:56,611 --> 00:27:59,220
You Think as if it's a reality.
Continually.

471
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,060
You ask if your relationship has 
potential,

472
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,050
you know,
and,

473
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,540
but it's a very,
very strange substance.

474
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:09,180
Whatever this potential is,
it's the,

475
00:28:09,181 --> 00:28:11,970
um,
it's unrealized possibility essentially,

476
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:12,804
but you regard it as something that's 
fluid and something that can develop in 

477
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:18,744
all sorts of different directions and 
something whose development you can 

478
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:24,960
shape because otherwise,
why would you feel guilty?

479
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,793
It's like,
you know,

480
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,083
if you're doing the wrong thing,
you're realizing some potential in the 

481
00:28:30,481 --> 00:28:33,270
wrong way and then you feel bad about 
that.

482
00:28:33,271 --> 00:28:35,430
It's like,
well there's,

483
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,393
there's some sense of intrinsic morality
operating at the bottom of that and 

484
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,660
we've talked a lot about that.
some of that's built in biologically.

485
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,080
Some of it's,
you know,

486
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,090
structured culturally,
some of it's a consequence of you trying

487
00:28:48,091 --> 00:28:49,390
to,
you know,

488
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,053
trying to organize your in this plethora
of semi beings that you are into some 

489
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:58,020
integrated manner.
Like it's a very,

490
00:28:58,021 --> 00:29:01,470
very complicated thing and it's not just
arbitrary.

491
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,020
Okay.
So that's the background,

492
00:29:04,021 --> 00:29:06,510
the dragon of chaos,
positive and negative.

493
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:07,344
And it's,
it's the thing out of which everything 

494
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,043
springs.
If you look at the scandinavian world 

495
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:16,620
tree for example,
or world trees in general,

496
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:17,454
you very frequently have a 
representation of a serpent that's 

497
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:20,544
associated with the reason that the 
potential is regarded as serpentine is 

498
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:29,160
extraordinarily complicated.

499
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,993
but I think it's partly because say 
snakes shed their own skin and so they 

500
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:35,304
can be reborn.
So there are a symbol of transformation 

501
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,753
and then they are sneaky and subtle and 
so they appear in places you wouldn't 

502
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:44,800
necessarily expect them to.
And then there were a terrible,

503
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:48,520
terrible threat.
But in overcoming that threat,

504
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:51,670
you also develop.
So not only are they a threat,

505
00:29:51,671 --> 00:29:54,400
but they're the kind of threat that 
makes you become strong.

506
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:55,330
Well,
you face it.

507
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,643
So that's partly why the snake is such 
an ambivalent figuring in most 

508
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,460
mythology.
So,

509
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,570
okay,
so that's complicated,

510
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:09,571
but we'll return to that later.
And then out of that you might say,

511
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:14,700
emerges the unknown as you encounter it.
So there's,

512
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,733
there's potential itself.
And then the first layer of potential 

513
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,480
are the things that you encountered that
you don't understand.

514
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,210
So I can give you an example of that.

515
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,400
so let's say you're a three year old or 
two year old,

516
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,510
that'll be,
that's better.

517
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:32,650
And you're in your kitchen and a mouse 
rent across the room and so you track it

518
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:33,484
because you know your eyes pick up the 
movement and you track the thing and 

519
00:30:36,431 --> 00:30:38,890
then it's,
it's an unexpected occurrence.

520
00:30:38,891 --> 00:30:40,960
So you don't know what it signifies.
Right?

521
00:30:40,961 --> 00:30:41,794
So that's the emergence of something 
tangibly unknown into your conceptual 

522
00:30:46,031 --> 00:30:46,864
space.
Now it's not like you lacked any 

523
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:50,464
knowledge of it.
You can tell that it what it sizes and 

524
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:55,480
you can get some estimation of its 
speed,

525
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,333
you know,
and I think that what you have to do 

526
00:30:58,961 --> 00:30:59,794
when you think about whether or not 
something is unknown is you have to 

527
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:03,124
think about it in relationship to that 
hierarchy of perception that I keep 

528
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,470
throwing at you.
You know,

529
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,950
if,
if,

530
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,790
if,
if something emerges,

531
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,713
if you encounter an entity and you can 
map it at every single level of your 

532
00:31:18,161 --> 00:31:21,520
value hierarchy,
then it's known,

533
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,090
you know,
how to interact with it at a micro level

534
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:30,660
and you know what its implications are 
for every other level of your conceptual

535
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,200
being.

536
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,033
You know,
what its implications are for the 

537
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:34,624
future.
Like you know exactly how to deal with 

538
00:31:35,921 --> 00:31:37,840
that thing.
It's mapping at every single level.

539
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,670
There's other things that are only 
mapped at one level and not others.

540
00:31:41,671 --> 00:31:42,504
So maybe you know,
you like the model s we'll say For the 

541
00:31:44,591 --> 00:31:45,690
child who's never seen him.
I,

542
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,563
it's like it shares some commonalities 
with objects that the child is familiar 

543
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:51,694
with,
but there's sufficient novelty so that 

544
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:55,114
it's also contaminated with the unknown 
and that makes the child basically 

545
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,080
alert,
semi startled and alert.

546
00:32:02,081 --> 00:32:05,530
Now the child will immediately refer to 
an adult.

547
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,143
It's a technical term actually.
They'll look at the adults face because 

548
00:32:10,241 --> 00:32:11,074
the adults face.
We'll broadcast the motivational and 

549
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,640
affective significance of that event and
so child looks references and then reads

550
00:32:21,311 --> 00:32:24,490
off the face of course the speech and 
the bodily auctions.

551
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,200
Exactly what that thing signifies,
you know,

552
00:32:27,201 --> 00:32:28,034
and,
and then if the person that they're 

553
00:32:29,171 --> 00:32:31,510
looking at jumps up on the table and 
screams,

554
00:32:31,511 --> 00:32:34,180
then that's one set of meanings,
which is god,

555
00:32:34,181 --> 00:32:35,320
this thing is magical.

556
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,170
It'S only this big.
And look at what effect it has on,

557
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:41,750
you know,
my aunt for the sake of argument,

558
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,351
who's,
you know,

559
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:45,740
pretty confident preacher as far as I 
can tell being two years old,

560
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,110
you know?
And then if she just dismisses it,

561
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,423
you know,
her actions are going to determine the 

562
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:51,794
meaning of that phenomena.
So that's how the transformation of the 

563
00:32:57,051 --> 00:33:01,370
semi known thing into the more known 
thing occurs,

564
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,580
occurs almost always in a social 
context.

565
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,593
You can explore things by yourself,
but you rarely actually do that by 

566
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:09,254
yourself.
It's almost always you plugged into a 

567
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:13,940
social apparatus,
you know,

568
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,340
so you might be doing the specific 
investigating,

569
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:17,174
but the social apparatus is around you 
so that you can confer with it and it 

570
00:33:21,711 --> 00:33:26,030
also shapes the way that you're going to
interact with that specific thing.

571
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:27,853
Okay,
so

572
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,233
now the unknown.
That's generally not the unknown that 

573
00:33:34,071 --> 00:33:36,560
you encountered that generally 
characterized

574
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:42,770
using feminine symbolism.
And I think the reason for that.

575
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,260
There's a bunch of reasons,
and we've talked about many of them.

576
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:47,443
One reason is because females do the 
sexual selection in human beings and so 

577
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:53,320
they act as the face of nature.
Another reason is,

578
00:33:53,321 --> 00:33:54,154
is that you can think of new possibility
always emerging out of the non cultural 

579
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:01,430
background in some sense.
You know.

580
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:02,264
So for example,
let's say that we send an expedition to 

581
00:34:06,051 --> 00:34:09,230
mars and we're gathering new 
information.

582
00:34:09,231 --> 00:34:10,064
As a consequence,
the reason we're gathering new 

583
00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:11,954
information is because we've gotten out 
past the domain of our knowledge in a 

584
00:34:15,441 --> 00:34:19,520
sense and we're interacting with 
something new and then that interaction,

585
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:24,200
new information is generated.
Now you can say that it's partly the act

586
00:34:24,201 --> 00:34:25,034
of the perceiver that's generating the 
new information and you can say that 

587
00:34:28,731 --> 00:34:32,540
it's partly the act of the culture 
because we send robots to mars,

588
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:33,950
let's say,
which is very,

589
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:37,010
very difficult.
So the culture goes there,

590
00:34:37,011 --> 00:34:40,400
but the individuals are observing,
so the individuals are buttressed by the

591
00:34:40,401 --> 00:34:41,234
culture,
but they are generating information 

592
00:34:42,621 --> 00:34:46,130
because there's somewhere truly new and 
so the information,

593
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:47,323
you know,
the unknown is a constant source of new 

594
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:49,874
information.
So it's a place that gives birth to new 

595
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:52,724
information and so that's another part 
of the reason that it seems to be 

596
00:34:55,611 --> 00:34:57,230
symbolized in feminine form.

597
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,623
No,
I'm just taking this in some senses and 

598
00:35:01,781 --> 00:35:02,614
empirical fact I've looked at it looks 
like that's how these stories work and 

599
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:11,230
so I'd be trying to puzzle out why 
exactly that would be the case.

600
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,273
You know?
I also think it's the case that we tend 

601
00:35:14,351 --> 00:35:17,770
to look at the world from a social 
cognitive perspective,

602
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,080
right?
We filter it through a social,

603
00:35:20,081 --> 00:35:22,990
cognitive,
biological apparatus,

604
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:27,370
and so we're very likely to see things 
in character for him and characters have

605
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:28,623
sexes and so that's going to happen.
And then which the attributes of 

606
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:37,090
femininity are the attributes of 
masculinity that get used.

607
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:41,730
Symbolic reference in some sense there.
There's an arbitrary ness about it.

608
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:44,070
So for example,
for the egyptians,

609
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,500
you know,
usually you have a sky god,

610
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:47,334
but they had a sky goddess.
Now she generally represent the night 

611
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:50,484
sky,
which is not exactly the same thing as 

612
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:53,370
the day sky,
but you know,

613
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,200
you,
you have to.

614
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,303
It's so tricky because you have to look 
at the relationships between the 

615
00:35:58,621 --> 00:36:01,140
characters in order to decide what all 
of the mean.

616
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:03,630
And that shifts a little bit from story 
to story.

617
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,570
So this is a,
what would you say?

618
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:09,960
It's an approximation of the underlying 
structure,

619
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,490
but there's a fair bit of variance in 
it.

620
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:14,370
Just like there's variation in stories 
so.

621
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,853
Well,
the feminine element has a destructive 

622
00:36:18,211 --> 00:36:23,211
element and a creative ass aspect,
and you can see that people characterize

623
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,140
their environments in that way.
So for example,

624
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,880
you can map on environmental beliefs 
onto this structure.

625
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:37,740
You can say that the environmentalist,
poor trays,

626
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:38,603
nature as positive,
portrays culture as negative and 

627
00:36:42,181 --> 00:36:43,014
portrays the individual is negative,
and the basic story is rampaging 

628
00:36:47,551 --> 00:36:48,384
individual as member of a rapacious 
culture invading the pristine landscape 

629
00:36:54,151 --> 00:36:56,610
of,
of beautiful mother nature.

630
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,980
Now the thing about that story is it's 
true.

631
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:03,930
The problem with this story is it's hAlf
true now.

632
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:04,764
So for example,
one thing that's interesting to 

633
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:10,860
conceptualize is that that's exactly the
opposite of the frontier myth.

634
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,263
Now,
the frontier myth was a story that was 

635
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,000
used extensIvely in europe to drive 
immigration into the United States,

636
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,190
and it was used to some degree in Canada
too.

637
00:37:20,191 --> 00:37:24,600
In this story was the exact opposite.
It's the hero.

638
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:25,823
So that would be the immigrant pioneer 
bringing the benefits of order to a 

639
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:31,440
savage wilderness.
Well,

640
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:32,274
that's also true,
but it's so interesting that both of 

641
00:37:35,131 --> 00:37:39,360
those things can be true and they're 
completely different from one another.

642
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:40,703
There's no commonality at all between 
those two stories except for the way 

643
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:45,384
that they use the characters.
There's a feminine character of a 

644
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,430
masculine character that represents 
culture,

645
00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:51,264
and then there's another character that 
represents the individual and you could 

646
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:57,390
even see that if you think about it 
historically,

647
00:37:57,391 --> 00:37:58,224
the us was founded in some sense on a 
frontier myth and you know that was too 

648
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:02,874
one sided,
and so by the time the 19 sixties came 

649
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:05,514
along the early 19 sixties,
it's shifted to its opposite and that 

650
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:09,804
you need that because
you like systems have to oscillate to 

651
00:38:14,401 --> 00:38:16,590
some degree to remain stable across 
time.

652
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,423
They can't just be fixed in place,
so they're going to play back and forth 

653
00:38:19,981 --> 00:38:20,814
through the archetypes in an attempt to 
keep them balanced because that's what 

654
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:25,284
you're trying to do.
You're trying to keep them balanced and 

655
00:38:28,621 --> 00:38:32,280
so while you have the destructive and 
creative element of mother nature,

656
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:35,590
you see that all the time in movies 
where the,

657
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,173
the,
the thing that the hero is striving as 

658
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,760
against is the negative element of the 
unknown.

659
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,980
How many of you have Seen the movie 
alien?

660
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,120
Okay,
so you know,

661
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,390
that's a pretty graphic representation 
of,

662
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,463
well those aliens are more reptilian 
informed so they're almost like there 

663
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,990
are more at the dragon of chaos level 
of,

664
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:58,883
of civilization,
but they're like a terrible external 

665
00:39:02,321 --> 00:39:05,110
force that's threatening human culture 
and the individual.

666
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:05,944
It's the exactly the opposite story 
that's played out in what was the movie 

667
00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:11,800
with all the blue creatures.

668
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:14,703
Avatar.
Avatar is exactly the opposite of that 

669
00:39:17,261 --> 00:39:18,230
where you know,
the,

670
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,263
the unknown nature is just nothing but 
it's like sweetness and bliss and you 

671
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:24,394
know,
and the,

672
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,593
and the human culture is portrayed as 
spearheaded by greedy and rapacious 

673
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:30,754
individuals who are basically 
manifestations of the military 

674
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:33,694
industrial complex.
And the funny thing is those both make 

675
00:39:36,071 --> 00:39:38,980
good stories and that's because,
well,

676
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:40,683
it's because they have enough archetipal
truth so that there's many situations 

677
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,860
that they're relevant to.
You know,

678
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,413
sometimes mother nature is your best 
friend and sometimes it's your worst 

679
00:39:52,481 --> 00:39:53,314
enemy.
SO you could go down to the jungles of 

680
00:39:55,271 --> 00:39:56,104
Peru and you could talk to the
people who lived there and you can find 

681
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:05,140
out what they know about medicinal 
plants in the jungle.

682
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,303
And you could bring home thingS to cure 
dIsease or you could just go down there 

683
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:12,070
and get lost in the jungle and then your
dad,

684
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,241
you know,
and in,

685
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:18,241
in some sense it's the same jungle and 
whether it's positive or negative,

686
00:40:18,761 --> 00:40:23,110
depends on what stance you take towards 
it and how you behave.

687
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,560
And so the other thing that's really 
interesting about mythology,

688
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,140
and this is the lovely element of 
mythology,

689
00:40:29,141 --> 00:40:29,974
is that part of what it does is tell you
how to take this incredibly complex 

690
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:37,030
landscape that's positive and negative 
at the same time,

691
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:42,031
at every level of analysis and how to 
navigate through it so that the belt,

692
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:48,060
the proper balance is maintained as far 
as really as far as the entire system is

693
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:50,710
concerned.
So,

694
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,770
so that culture has an orderly element 
and that's what protects us here.

695
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:57,604
And it has a tyrannical element.
And that's what makes you treated like 

696
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:02,160
numbers at the university of toronto.
You know,

697
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,540
you get both of those have exactly the 
same time.

698
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,973
And then the architect will,
individual has the same fundamental 

699
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:10,780
nature,
hero or villain.

700
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,010
And you know,
those,

701
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:12,843
those have archetypal roots because the 
ultimate hero is the ultimate perfect 

702
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,160
person and the ultimate villain is,
you know,

703
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,420
satan himself in whatever for me happens
to take,

704
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,033
you know,
and

705
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,460
it doesn't take much knowledge of this 
structure before you can start seeing it

706
00:41:30,461 --> 00:41:31,294
manifest itself all over,
especially especially movies that are 

707
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:34,604
particularly popular because they almost
always have a central architectural 

708
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,953
feat.

709
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:41,000
The marvel superhero movies are a really
good example of that.

710
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,900
So,
you know,

711
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:47,450
and if it's complex literature,
the architects are mixed to some degree.

712
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:50,450
So you have a hero who's not only a 
hero,

713
00:41:50,451 --> 00:41:52,640
you have a hero,
has all sorts of flaws,

714
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:53,474
you know,
had these in the culture or she's in a 

715
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:55,724
culture that has positive elements and 
negative elements that they're in a 

716
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,533
broader landscape.
This characterized by exactly the same 

717
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:03,830
thing.
So it's nuanced,

718
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,800
you know,
and the more sophisticated you get,

719
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:08,990
the more you can tolerate that kind of 
nuance.

720
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:09,824
And I think that's also one of the 
things that's partly why literature is 

721
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:12,914
such a good antidote to radiology 
because the more sophisticated the 

722
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:17,564
literature becomes,
the more complex and fragmented in some 

723
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:22,334
sense or no differentiated,
the more differentiated the 

724
00:42:24,681 --> 00:42:29,681
architectural landscape becomes.
So when someone tells you a story,

725
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,214
whatever the story happens to be,
one of the things you can do when you 

726
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,300
know the substructures,
you can say,

727
00:42:35,301 --> 00:42:35,991
okay,
yeah,

728
00:42:35,991 --> 00:42:37,640
but where were the missing pieces?

729
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,523
Where are they going?
Because if they're not included and 

730
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:44,540
they're generally projected onto 
something because they're there,

731
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:48,260
you can't get away from there there.
How does the person account for them?

732
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:49,760
You know,
so.

733
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,253
All right.
So then now I want to tell you another 

734
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:54,224
story.
So we talked about the mesopotamian 

735
00:42:57,051 --> 00:42:57,884
creation last can.
Now I want to tell you about the 

736
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:00,644
egyptian myth of sovereignty.
And so the first thing I should do is 

737
00:43:04,401 --> 00:43:05,234
say that all of the stories that I'm 
talking to you about have all sorts of 

738
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:10,610
variance,
you know.

739
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:11,863
And so the,
the egyptian story that I'm going to 

740
00:43:14,331 --> 00:43:17,840
describe lasted for thousands and 
thousands of years.

741
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,600
So it isn't like there was only one 
variation of it,

742
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:21,434
there's all sorts of variations of it 
and I'm only going to tell you one of 

743
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:24,584
them and that's a limitation,
but that's just how it is for the time 

744
00:43:28,881 --> 00:43:29,714
being.

745
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,440
So I'm not saying that this is the only 
version of this story,

746
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,533
but it's average in and it's the one I'm
most familiar with and so I can talk 

747
00:43:38,841 --> 00:43:43,841
about it hopefully with some utility and
it's a great story.

748
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,370
When I finally figured out what it 
meant,

749
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,233
it's so cool with some of these stories,
like if you crack them and you're able 

750
00:43:50,181 --> 00:43:53,780
to see what they mean,
they're absolutely overwhelming.

751
00:43:53,781 --> 00:43:55,910
There are so bloody brilliant.
It's just,

752
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,790
it's no wonder that people regard them 
as revelatory,

753
00:43:59,130 --> 00:43:59,963
you know,
of divine origin because they have such 

754
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,840
power that it's almost impossible to 
imagine how that got there.

755
00:44:05,841 --> 00:44:09,890
Now I have provided you with a darwinian
explanation of how that got there,

756
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:10,803
right?
Because the stories are representations 

757
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,693
of
social contracts and behavioral 

758
00:44:16,611 --> 00:44:20,030
tendencies that have evolved over 
thousands and thousands of years.

759
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,070
Because of that,
the representation,

760
00:44:22,071 --> 00:44:22,904
the story is going to have way more 
information in it than a typical story 

761
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:27,074
might,
but I still can understand how these 

762
00:44:29,631 --> 00:44:30,920
things burst upon people.

763
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:33,340
The force of revelation,
you know,

764
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:35,550
and one of the things that's quite 
interesting too,

765
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:36,384
if you look at cultures historically is 
that you usually find that the 

766
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:44,040
revelation of the story,
it's like the energy source on which the

767
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:46,890
culture feeds.
So the story comes first.

768
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:47,993
It has this tremendous dynamic energy.
The culture basically uses that energy 

769
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:54,140
to propel itself through time,
you know,

770
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:54,983
to give it conviction and force,
and then at some point the story 

771
00:44:58,501 --> 00:45:01,500
exhausts itself and that would be 
equivalent in some sense,

772
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:03,600
I suppose,
to nietzsche's announcement of the death

773
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:06,540
of god.
And this has happened many times.

774
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,780
So.
All right,

775
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:13,620
so there's four main characters in the 
egyptian story.

776
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,880
There's cyrus,
isis set and horace now.

777
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:23,970
Oh,
sarah's.

778
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:24,803
We'll start with those series.
but you could start with any of the 

779
00:45:26,281 --> 00:45:30,000
characters because one of the things 
that's quite interesting about mythology

780
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:30,834
is that the myths don't make any 
distinction between the causal priority 

781
00:45:34,141 --> 00:45:35,100
of these characters.

782
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,940
Any of them can be regarded as 
fundamental,

783
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,240
so the hero is the person who separates 
the world.

784
00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:43,410
Parents,
for example,

785
00:45:43,411 --> 00:45:47,280
it brings being into existence,
but you can also say,

786
00:45:47,281 --> 00:45:48,450
well,
it's time math,

787
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:53,310
which is more how the mesopotamian 
creation myth is tilted.

788
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:54,270
Or you can say,
well,

789
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:55,283
you can't make sense out of anything 
unless you have a cultural lens through 

790
00:45:58,801 --> 00:45:59,634
which you're looking like you know,
there has to be some preexisting 

791
00:46:01,851 --> 00:46:05,940
structure before information can be 
generated in any manner,

792
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:09,780
so you're always stuck with this problem
that in order for something to exist,

793
00:46:09,781 --> 00:46:10,614
you need a substrate,
you need an interpretive structure and 

794
00:46:14,281 --> 00:46:15,114
you need an interpreter and that's.
And you can't say that one of those 

795
00:46:18,721 --> 00:46:19,554
things precedes the other there.
They all have to be there at the same 

796
00:46:22,051 --> 00:46:22,884
time.
You could say from a darwinian 

797
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:26,543
perspective,
they all emerged and complexified in 

798
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:31,350
unison like that.

799
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:32,310
As,
as you know,

800
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:36,750
as time progressed,
it doesn't explain how the origin of the

801
00:46:36,751 --> 00:46:38,220
orange originated.
However,

802
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,890
okay,
so you've got to osiris now.

803
00:46:40,891 --> 00:46:45,891
Osiris is the founder of the egyptian 
state and so you know,

804
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:47,873
before people wrote things down,
you have to kind of try to understand 

805
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:58,320
how it was that they remembered things 
like they,

806
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:03,950
their memory was more like an amalgam or
adjust.

807
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:06,210
So we already know that,
you know,

808
00:47:06,211 --> 00:47:10,590
if you tell the story of your,
of your actions yesterday,

809
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:13,500
that it doesn't take you 16 hours to 
tell the story,

810
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,410
hopefully takes you like five minutes 
and why that is,

811
00:47:18,411 --> 00:47:20,790
it's not obvious,
but part of the reason is,

812
00:47:20,791 --> 00:47:25,791
is that for whatever,
for whatever underlying reasons,

813
00:47:25,831 --> 00:47:26,664
you know,
what parts of the story are relevant to 

814
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,913
people and what parts aren't.
So basically what you're going to do is 

815
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:33,784
try not to tell them things they already
know because that would just be 

816
00:47:37,151 --> 00:47:37,720
pointless.

817
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,553
And in order to do that,
you more or less have to know what they 

818
00:47:40,601 --> 00:47:44,220
know and what they don't know.
And you have to more or less stay on the

819
00:47:44,221 --> 00:47:45,640
edge of that.
But you can do that.

820
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,490
Well,
I might ask you what,

821
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:49,324
what,
what did you do over the last three 

822
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:51,370
months?
Or I could sAy,

823
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:52,204
well,
what have you done for the last couple 

824
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:54,041
of years?
And in each case,

825
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:56,740
you're going to collapse that into some 
representation.

826
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,510
Now imagine that the problem you're 
trying to solve is what did your culture

827
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:05,110
do for the last 5,000 years?
Well,

828
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,720
imagine that there are.
There are.

829
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:16,200
The culture in part is being continually
informed by the individuals that compose

830
00:48:16,601 --> 00:48:17,434
it and they're going to be different 
individuals have different stature who 

831
00:48:21,821 --> 00:48:23,770
discovered things of different 
important.

832
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,693
you know,
when we we often know some people lIke 

833
00:48:26,381 --> 00:48:27,880
that.
We know if thomas edison,

834
00:48:27,881 --> 00:48:30,610
for example,
and we can name actual people,

835
00:48:30,611 --> 00:48:31,444
but that's partly because we write 
things down in records of can imagine 

836
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:35,584
though that you're trying to represent 
your history in a way that you can 

837
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:40,960
remember.

838
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,793
You're going to tell the stories about 
people who've done interesting things 

839
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:46,323
because that's what you do.
Even when you tell a story about 

840
00:48:47,681 --> 00:48:48,514
yourself.
So imagine you tell one story about 

841
00:48:50,441 --> 00:48:51,274
someone who did something interesting 
and then you tell another story about 

842
00:48:53,351 --> 00:48:56,020
someone else who did something 
interesting and so forth,

843
00:48:56,021 --> 00:49:00,640
and that's continually going on.
Let's say in a tribal archaic culture,

844
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:02,013
and so then what you get is a set of 
stories about people doing interesting 

845
00:49:05,081 --> 00:49:06,640
things.
Well,

846
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,313
it's easy for that to shift into the 
ancestors doing interesting things and 

847
00:49:12,731 --> 00:49:13,564
then it's easy for them to shift into 
the ancestor doing wonderful things and 

848
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:18,574
that's basically what happens is that 
you get the emergence of the culture 

849
00:49:21,881 --> 00:49:22,714
story,
which is something like a small set of 

850
00:49:24,971 --> 00:49:25,804
culture heroes who've done all the 
things that are worth doing and what 

851
00:49:29,141 --> 00:49:33,010
you're doing is imitating them and you 
know this is,

852
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:33,970
you know,
your,

853
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:34,803
your,
your empirical memory of events only 

854
00:49:39,251 --> 00:49:41,440
lasts about 100 years,
right?

855
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,273
Because there isn't anyone old enough to
remember anything past that and so what 

856
00:49:45,731 --> 00:49:49,660
has to happen is that everything that 
happened before that has to be collapsed

857
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:54,280
into some form that's memorable so that 
it can be brought forward and taught.

858
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:55,960
And that's,
that's how these.

859
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:58,360
That's the function of these stories,
these stories.

860
00:49:58,361 --> 00:49:59,194
Actually.
It's almost as if the story has 

861
00:50:01,931 --> 00:50:02,764
abandoned everything that hasn't stuck 
in people's memories and so all that's 

862
00:50:06,941 --> 00:50:11,941
left is the most significant is the most
significance because otherwise why would

863
00:50:12,431 --> 00:50:14,320
people bother with it?
They wouldn't tell the story.

864
00:50:14,321 --> 00:50:18,360
They wouldn't be gripped by it,
so okay,

865
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:20,350
so cyrus,
he's one of these figures.

866
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:21,184
You could think if,
if you allow people to tell stories 

867
00:50:23,471 --> 00:50:24,304
about George Washington,
say in a bleak and an all the semi 

868
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:29,510
mythologized founders of the United 
States,

869
00:50:29,511 --> 00:50:30,344
if you allowed people in the absence of 
textbooks and writing to tell stories 

870
00:50:34,551 --> 00:50:38,840
about those men for the next thousand 
years,

871
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:39,883
maybe what you'd get out of that is an 
origin story of the mythic founder of 

872
00:50:43,161 --> 00:50:43,994
the state,
and that seems to be what's happened In 

873
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,050
the egyptian case with cyrus.

874
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:50,660
Now he's,
he's a god,

875
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:53,503
but he's got human characteristics and 
so he's also granted the the status of 

876
00:50:59,061 --> 00:51:01,640
something that's eternal.
Okay?

877
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:04,940
Now here's the story of osiris.
Roughly speaking,

878
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:09,830
he's kind of old now and he's little bit
blind,

879
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,233
but he's blind in a specific way,
and the way that he specifically blind 

880
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:17,420
is that he's willfully blind.
Now,

881
00:51:17,421 --> 00:51:19,370
If you're willfully blind to the 
egyptian,

882
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:24,320
say this straightforwardly,
don't tell you why they believe this.

883
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:25,423
If you're willfully blind,
there's things that you could know that 

884
00:51:27,531 --> 00:51:28,364
you take pains not to know,
and willful blindness under english 

885
00:51:32,901 --> 00:51:37,460
common law can be grounds for,
for criminal convictions.

886
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:38,323
So for example,
if you run a company and you think that 

887
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:41,564
your treasure is cooking the books,
but it's working to your favor and you 

888
00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:46,520
decide,
well,

889
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:49,970
I just won't look.
And then later it comes out,

890
00:51:49,971 --> 00:51:50,601
you can say,
well,

891
00:51:50,601 --> 00:51:51,500
I didn't know.

892
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,690
And people who are prosecuting and say,
yeah,

893
00:51:53,691 --> 00:51:57,590
but you could have known and he took a 
conscious choice not to know.

894
00:51:57,591 --> 00:51:58,424
So you're culpable.
And I think that's actually the best 

895
00:52:01,101 --> 00:52:01,934
model of friday and repression in the 
sentences that it isn't exactly 

896
00:52:04,941 --> 00:52:05,774
repression.
It's failure to make the effort to know 

897
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:13,691
something that you could know.
So now sometimes look,

898
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,590
sometimes something terrible happens to 
you.

899
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:16,424
You just can't understand,
but sometimes something terrible is 

900
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:23,180
happening and you refuse to think about 
it and because you refuse to think about

901
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,770
it,
you really don't know what it is.

902
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,260
So,
but,

903
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:27,303
and you mIght say,
well I can't be culpable then because I 

904
00:52:28,851 --> 00:52:29,684
don't know what it is,
but you could have known so you're 

905
00:52:32,391 --> 00:52:33,224
culpable.
So it's voluntary ignorance and that's 

906
00:52:36,561 --> 00:52:39,920
the problem with cyrus.
He was a great guy when he was young,

907
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:42,620
he was a hero.
He founded the egyptian state,

908
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:44,300
but you know,
he's not.

909
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:49,520
Everything could be anymore.
He's got anachronistic and outdated and,

910
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,010
and willfully blind,
which is even worse.

911
00:52:52,011 --> 00:52:55,160
Now there's an idea here.
It's such a bloody brilliant idea.

912
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:58,640
It's mind boggling.
So I saw her or cyrus is the,

913
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:00,103
is the state manifested in personified 
form and that's reasonable because the 

914
00:53:05,451 --> 00:53:09,800
state is like a person.
The person of the state is manifested in

915
00:53:09,801 --> 00:53:10,634
the body of laws.
You guys all imitate that body of laws 

916
00:53:16,641 --> 00:53:19,400
and that's what basically makes you 
citizens of the state.

917
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,650
You okay?
Good,

918
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:29,130
good.
So that's what makes you citizens of the

919
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:31,110
state.
You can all get along because all of you

920
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:31,944
are imitating the same thing and what 
you're imitating is the central body of 

921
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:41,190
custom and law that makes up the state.
That's why you can predict each other.

922
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,920
So that makes you a good citizen.
Now you know,

923
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:48,060
the problem with being a good citizen is
that sometimes if you're a good citizen,

924
00:53:48,061 --> 00:53:50,040
you're a bad person,
right?

925
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:51,900
That's a big problem.
So for example,

926
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:56,100
the better you were at being a nazi,
in all likelihood,

927
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,770
the worst a person you were.
And so that's a,

928
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,673
that's a very useful observation because
one of the things that shows us that 

929
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:04,763
even though it's necessary for you to 
imitate the central personality of the 

930
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:09,624
state,
sometimes the central personality with 

931
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:12,414
the state can be pathological.
And the egyptians who established a 

932
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:17,940
quite a lengthy state,
you know,

933
00:54:17,941 --> 00:54:20,940
as opposed to say to the mesopotamians,
the egyptians had been

934
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:26,280
existing in a complex state apparatus 
for a very long period of time.

935
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:31,200
they started to encounter problems that 
were intrinsic to the state.

936
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,650
And remember in the mesopotamian 
creation myth,

937
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:37,250
the primary danger was tire map.
You know,

938
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,790
you make a lot of racket,
you kill appsu that's ordered,

939
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,990
timeout,
comes flooding back and takes you out.

940
00:54:42,991 --> 00:54:43,824
Well,
you can imagine that that would be the 

941
00:54:44,431 --> 00:54:48,510
primary story of people in a 
civilization that was somewhat fragile.

942
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:53,100
There are a hell of a lot more worried 
about being invaded by the next round of

943
00:54:53,101 --> 00:54:53,934
barbarians are having their crops fail 
or being flooded out or something like 

944
00:54:56,791 --> 00:55:00,790
that than they are concerned about 
whether or not the whole state apparatus

945
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,673
become corrupted is going to collapse.
Now they're partly concerned about that 

946
00:55:04,771 --> 00:55:06,960
because remember,
martech is supposed to be.

947
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,033
The emperor is supposed to be being a 
good marduk and keeping an eye on 

948
00:55:10,951 --> 00:55:12,480
everything,
but the myth,

949
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:16,410
the mythic structure only talks about 
absolute tiny little bit.

950
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:17,483
They basically say,
don't kill timeouts consort or you'll 

951
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:21,690
make her angry.
Okay.

952
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,740
The egyptians take that lot farther.
They look at,

953
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:25,381
oh,
cyrus.

954
00:55:25,381 --> 00:55:25,981
And they say,
well,

955
00:55:25,981 --> 00:55:26,814
he was.
There was really something good about 

956
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:28,920
him.
Without him,

957
00:55:28,921 --> 00:55:29,754
we wouldn't even have our state,
so we bloody well better be happy about 

958
00:55:32,521 --> 00:55:35,940
that because the state is better than no
state,

959
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:38,190
you know,
path a lot.

960
00:55:38,191 --> 00:55:41,340
You could say pathological order is 
better than absolute chaos.

961
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:43,890
Now you can have an argument about that,
but whatever.

962
00:55:43,891 --> 00:55:44,700
it's,
you know,

963
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,890
depends on how pathological the order 
obviously,

964
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:51,300
but it isn't that untrammeled chaos is a
good solution.

965
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:55,440
I think that you can,
and I'm only using this as an example,

966
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:00,360
you know the americans well and us as 
well.

967
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:05,410
We went into Iraq to take out a person 
who is clearly a dictator and who had,

968
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:11,250
who is a pretty bad guy and who had 
really bad sons,

969
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:12,713
you know,
and his heroes were people like stalin 

970
00:56:13,981 --> 00:56:14,814
and hitler.

971
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:16,470
Well,
they took them out.

972
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:22,460
Well then what?
Well then all hell broke loose,

973
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,153
you know,
because the theory was you take out the 

974
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:30,790
bad guy at the top and all the good guys
at the bottom get together and instantly

975
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:33,340
they have a good governments.
Like that isn't what happened at all.

976
00:56:33,341 --> 00:56:37,300
What happened was the whole state 
degenerated into chaos and partly out of

977
00:56:37,301 --> 00:56:38,134
that chaos came isis and it's not self 
evident that isis is preferable to who 

978
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:46,930
saying least hussein educated,
older women,

979
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,690
you know,
and he was relatively secular.

980
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:50,643
All things considered.
So I'm not making a case for who's 

981
00:56:53,071 --> 00:56:54,140
saying.
My point is,

982
00:56:54,141 --> 00:56:55,420
is that,
you know,

983
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,110
you have to be careful when you disrupt 
order,

984
00:56:59,111 --> 00:56:59,944
even if it's pathological because he,
god only knows what's going to spring 

985
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:03,493
forth.
And that doesn't mean that you should 

986
00:57:04,841 --> 00:57:07,270
never try to overcome pathological 
order,

987
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:09,070
but it does mean that you should be 
very,

988
00:57:09,071 --> 00:57:09,790
very careful.

989
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:11,530
we need to do so,
you know,

990
00:57:11,570 --> 00:57:12,403
you have to do a micro analysis in some 
sense to make sure that you know what 

991
00:57:15,071 --> 00:57:17,950
the hell you're doing.
So.

992
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,170
All right,
so anyway,

993
00:57:19,171 --> 00:57:20,860
so why is cyrus?
He's a good guy,

994
00:57:20,861 --> 00:57:22,270
man.
He established the state,

995
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:24,250
he was awake guy.
He was a hero.

996
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,093
He,
he made order out of chaos and that's 

997
00:57:28,661 --> 00:57:29,890
where you live.
So great.

998
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:30,753
But he's a little old,
a little out of date and he's willfully 

999
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:37,750
blind.
And that's so smart because I think what

1000
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:38,584
the egyptians did,
his cow encapsulate in narrative form 

1001
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,530
the primary danger of all human 
institutions.

1002
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,453
There's two of them.
And ellie added talks about this a lot 

1003
00:57:47,771 --> 00:57:51,430
with regards to flood mythology.
So here's an example.

1004
00:57:51,431 --> 00:57:52,264
So there are flood myths all over the 
world and there may have even been a 

1005
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:55,804
flood.
There's pretty good archeological 

1006
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,360
evidence for that.

1007
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,253
That there was a great flood about 
13,000 years ago when a bunch of 

1008
00:58:01,331 --> 00:58:04,120
comments hit the earth and melted the 
north american ice shield,

1009
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:05,493
but we won't get into that,
but doesn't really matter because the 

1010
00:58:08,441 --> 00:58:12,940
mythological substructure of the story 
still has the same meaning regardless of

1011
00:58:12,941 --> 00:58:16,780
its historical reality.
So in the biblical story of the flood,

1012
00:58:16,781 --> 00:58:20,110
basically what happens is that humanity 
is created.

1013
00:58:20,111 --> 00:58:24,700
Then they degenerate rapidly and they 
get so degenerate,

1014
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:25,593
which is sort of like the elder gods 
getting out of hand in the mesopotamian 

1015
00:58:27,911 --> 00:58:30,580
story that god thinks,
oh to hell with all of you.

1016
00:58:30,581 --> 00:58:32,140
You're,
you're a big mistake.

1017
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,900
I'm just going to wipe you out.
You know?

1018
00:58:34,901 --> 00:58:37,320
But he finds one good guy that's no 
nolan,

1019
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:40,310
you know,
out of noah who's like another adam.

1020
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:43,620
In some sense the world is of human 
beings is regenerated.

1021
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:48,190
But the idea is,
is that corrupt people get washed away.

1022
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,033
So and eliana talks about the flood myth
all over the world or change it and he 

1023
00:58:55,811 --> 00:58:56,644
says that generally speaking,
there's two reasons why the dante's 

1024
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:04,660
flood the planet and what is the system 
is old and out of date.

1025
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:05,973
And the second is that people are 
corrupt and then if you get the two 

1026
00:59:08,291 --> 00:59:11,310
things working together,
you get a system that's out of date that

1027
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,050
becomes pathological faster because 
people are corrupt.

1028
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:19,780
And so I think that you can use the 
flooded new orleans is a good example of

1029
00:59:19,781 --> 00:59:21,710
that because on the one hand you can 
say,

1030
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,790
well it was a hurricane,
so that's a natural disaster.

1031
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:28,130
But on the other hand you could say,
well,

1032
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:33,610
people knew the dam dykes were too weak 
and they didn't do anything about it.

1033
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:36,350
You know,
they were only built for 100 year storm.

1034
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,650
And Louisiana is corrupt beyond belief.

1035
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:41,600
I mean for,
for a democratic state,

1036
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:43,370
it's not corrupt compared to most 
states,

1037
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,980
but it's really corrupt compared to most
democratic states.

1038
00:59:45,981 --> 00:59:46,814
And if you dump money into Louisiana,
it just goes into people's pockets 

1039
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:51,200
anyways.
And the infrastructure doesn't get fixed

1040
00:59:51,201 --> 00:59:53,120
up.
So then you might ask yourself,

1041
00:59:53,121 --> 00:59:53,954
well,
was the flood of consequence of a 

1042
00:59:54,771 --> 00:59:57,410
natural disaster or the blindness of the
culture?

1043
00:59:57,830 --> 00:59:58,663
Well,
you can never tell which of those are 

1044
01:00:00,951 --> 01:00:01,790
true.
You know,

1045
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:05,060
if you freeze to death in the winter,
is it because it's colder because you're

1046
01:00:05,061 --> 01:00:06,770
stupid,
you know,

1047
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:07,610
it's,
it's,

1048
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:10,160
there's no difference between those two 
things.

1049
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:11,503
So if you get wiped out,
it's because nature comes after you and 

1050
01:00:14,241 --> 01:00:15,074
because your culture isn't sufficient to
protect you and so you can't separate 

1051
01:00:18,651 --> 01:00:20,600
those two things.
Okay?

1052
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:24,500
So now the other case that the egyptians
are making,

1053
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:27,880
and this is quite cool,
is that if you take a system that's it's

1054
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,540
doing just fine and you just leave it 
alone long enough,

1055
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:36,380
it becomes dysfunctional and there's a 
bunch of reasons for that.

1056
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:37,210
I mean,
you know,

1057
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:38,043
will,
you imagined that you take your laptop 

1058
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:42,493
and it's in perfect working order and 
you put it in the closet for 20 years 

1059
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:48,320
and you take it out,
what do you have?

1060
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,890
It'll still turn on.
Do you have a laptop?

1061
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,060
Well,
no.

1062
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:54,163
You know by then it won't even work.
Won't be able to communicate with the 

1063
01:00:58,191 --> 01:00:59,024
internet.
There won't be any peripherals that can 

1064
01:01:00,381 --> 01:01:01,214
plug into it.
The software be so outdated that you 

1065
01:01:02,811 --> 01:01:05,840
won't even know how to use It.
Like it's a brick basically.

1066
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,700
And so the point is,
is that,

1067
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:10,070
and you can really see this with 
electronic equipment,

1068
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,833
a perfectly functional thing maintained 
in status of its own accord becomes 

1069
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,593
dysfunctional.
And so what that means is you have to 

1070
01:01:19,611 --> 01:01:23,630
run around like a mad hyena,
just keeping your things working.

1071
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,210
Now,
of course you know that because like how

1072
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,630
much time do you spend in a month 
updating your electronics,

1073
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,480
you know,
it's just a treadmill of update,

1074
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:34,700
you know,
and I think part of the reason that they

1075
01:01:34,701 --> 01:01:35,534
haven't contributed much to overall 
productivity is because people take all 

1076
01:01:38,721 --> 01:01:39,110
the time.

1077
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:42,050
They used to waste typing things out on 
paper,

1078
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:43,630
trying to keep their,
their,

1079
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:47,180
they're efficient electronics actually 
working and you know,

1080
01:01:47,181 --> 01:01:49,850
learning all the things you have to 
learn and relearning them.

1081
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:53,540
There's this scene in alice in 
wonderland,

1082
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:55,580
alice is in underwear,
right?

1083
01:01:56,690 --> 01:02:01,010
And she meets the red queen down there.
So that's mother nature and she's always

1084
01:02:01,011 --> 01:02:03,530
runnIng around going off with their 
heads off with their heads,

1085
01:02:03,531 --> 01:02:04,364
which is in an arbitrary way,
which is of course what the red queen 

1086
01:02:06,321 --> 01:02:09,030
does.
And at one point she tells alice,

1087
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:10,400
it's,
it's such a,

1088
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:15,830
it's such a remarkably deep line.
She says to ellis in my kingdom,

1089
01:02:16,461 --> 01:02:19,740
you have to run as fast as you can just 
to stay in the same place.

1090
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:22,213
And that's exactly right.
So you can think the environment that 

1091
01:02:25,011 --> 01:02:28,490
you're trying to adapt to is that 
dynamic content,

1092
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:31,880
intonation of patterns,
and it's transforming across time,

1093
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:35,900
not completely unpredictably,
but certainly not predictably.

1094
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:40,580
And so that means that if you build a 
structure that is adapted to it,

1095
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,133
that structure has to change and flow in
keeping with the change and flow of the 

1096
01:02:45,771 --> 01:02:49,280
underlying environment or it gets 
outdated,

1097
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,173
you know,
it gets,

1098
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:52,250
what do you call that?
Obsolescent.

1099
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:53,683
And so all you have to do Is sit there 
and do nothing and you'll become 

1100
01:02:55,641 --> 01:02:56,474
obsolescent.
And so that's part of the problem with 

1101
01:02:58,551 --> 01:03:02,240
those cyrus being old.
He was good guy when he was young,

1102
01:03:02,241 --> 01:03:03,074
but he's old now.
And the old solutions don't solve the 

1103
01:03:05,631 --> 01:03:06,464
new problems.
And you could call that a egyptian 

1104
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,640
existential statement.
All of you have a culture.

1105
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:18,980
It's old,
it doesn't apply or doesn't apply.

1106
01:03:18,981 --> 01:03:19,814
Well.
And so what are you going to do with 

1107
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:21,890
you?
Throw the whole thing out.

1108
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,510
Well,
we know what happens.

1109
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:26,450
The mesopotamians already told us what 
happens if you do that.

1110
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,313
It's like thai map comes flooding back 
and all hell breaks loose so you can't 

1111
01:03:30,501 --> 01:03:33,620
throw everything away,
but it doesn't work very well.

1112
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,590
So it's up to you to figure out how to 
fix it.

1113
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,830
So okay,
so now.

1114
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:40,680
But now.
Oh sorry,

1115
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:43,310
I've got another problem is you might 
say,

1116
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:49,740
well let's say you've got an old 
computer.

1117
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:50,603
This by the way,
in case you haven't noticed is a very 

1118
01:03:51,991 --> 01:03:52,824
old computer and in a way if you keep 
tapping on it and upgrading it a little 

1119
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:00,190
bit,
you could keep it more or less uptodate.

1120
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:02,220
At some point you're going to have to 
throw the whole damn thing away,

1121
01:04:02,221 --> 01:04:06,360
but you can do incremental changes to it
on a continual basis.

1122
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:08,730
And the thing will more or less stay 
functional.

1123
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,290
You can think about those incremental 
changes as partial revolutions,

1124
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,850
right?
Matt?

1125
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:19,230
Remember that hierarchy now and then you
have to change the operating system.

1126
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:23,760
That sucks because that means everything
underneath virtually has to change,

1127
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:27,780
but more more often you're doing a tweak
here and tweak their,

1128
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,190
you know,
at lower,

1129
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,870
more specific levels and if you tweak 
now often the probability that the whole

1130
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:34,704
thing is going to collapse and that 
you'll have to do a clean install is 

1131
01:04:36,931 --> 01:04:37,764
quite low.

1132
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:41,250
While the same thing applies to the 
state logically enough,

1133
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:43,620
this is the state,
right?

1134
01:04:43,621 --> 01:04:45,690
If you think your laptop isn't the 
state,

1135
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,480
then you're not thinking about your 
laptop properly.

1136
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:49,493
It's the state,
so when it's going to be more and more 

1137
01:04:51,671 --> 01:04:54,330
of the state as we progress over the 
next 20 years,

1138
01:04:54,331 --> 01:04:57,660
you know so.
So you know that if you're aware and you

1139
01:04:57,661 --> 01:04:59,610
keep the updates happen,
you stay awake,

1140
01:04:59,611 --> 01:05:00,444
that you can keep the thing functioning.
At some point it's going to get so 

1141
01:05:02,821 --> 01:05:04,890
anachronistic.
It's better just to replace it,

1142
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,770
which is also by the way,
what's going to happen to all of you.

1143
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:11,490
Right?
And it's a decision that evolution it in

1144
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:15,840
some sense in biology has made that at 
some point trying to keep you updated is

1145
01:05:15,841 --> 01:05:20,841
so bloody complicated that you might as 
well just get rid of the whole thing and

1146
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:22,740
let something new occurring.

1147
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:25,990
I'm really dead serious about this 
because depth evolved.

1148
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:27,663
You know,
you have elements in you that are three 

1149
01:05:29,021 --> 01:05:33,490
and a half billion years old.
Not everything dies and some,

1150
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:36,040
some creatures are functionally 
immortal,

1151
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:40,150
so but no at us.
And the reason is as well,

1152
01:05:40,151 --> 01:05:42,490
at some point we just were too old to be
updated.

1153
01:05:42,491 --> 01:05:47,491
And so that's the end of that seems to 
happen over about a 100 year period.

1154
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:52,030
So anyways,
you can do incremental.

1155
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,670
Now imagine you just ignore your 
computer completely.

1156
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:57,310
You don't update the thing at all.
Well,

1157
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:03,250
it's going to get anachronistic of its 
own accord.

1158
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:07,240
But if you refuse to engage in those 
operations,

1159
01:06:07,241 --> 01:06:08,074
that would keep it updated,
it's going to get anachronistic a lot 

1160
01:06:09,971 --> 01:06:12,640
faster.
And that's what happens to a cyrus.

1161
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:13,503
They say the same thing.
It's like he's old and that's part of 

1162
01:06:17,711 --> 01:06:20,110
the problem.
He's past his prime,

1163
01:06:20,111 --> 01:06:22,810
but the worst part of the problem is 
that he's willfully blind.

1164
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:27,550
He won't take action even though he 
knows it's necessary,

1165
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:32,110
and so he gets out of date and 
pathological,

1166
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:32,973
faster than necessary.
Now you know when you hear in the flood 

1167
01:06:36,011 --> 01:06:39,280
stories that god is angry about the sins
of men,

1168
01:06:39,281 --> 01:06:40,960
and that's why he washes everything 
away.

1169
01:06:40,961 --> 01:06:42,190
It's the same idea.
Now,

1170
01:06:42,191 --> 01:06:43,024
the word sin comes from the greek word 
hamartia and hamartia is an archery 

1171
01:06:48,431 --> 01:06:49,264
term,
and to sin means not to hit the center 

1172
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:52,594
of the target.
And so basically the idea in the flood 

1173
01:06:56,141 --> 01:06:56,974
of stories is that if enough people 
aren't aiming at the target or hitting 

1174
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:03,520
the center,
then things are gonna get so corrupted,

1175
01:07:03,521 --> 01:07:04,354
unstable,
that everything is going to get washed 

1176
01:07:05,861 --> 01:07:07,270
away.
And that's right.

1177
01:07:07,271 --> 01:07:11,410
It's exactly perfectly accurate.
So,

1178
01:07:11,411 --> 01:07:12,580
which is very,
very cool.

1179
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:14,770
It's very remarkable that that's the 
case.

1180
01:07:14,771 --> 01:07:16,330
Okay,
so now cyrus,

1181
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:19,750
because this is a myth,
has an evil brother.

1182
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:23,500
Now that's pretty common occurrence.
If you look at the lion king,

1183
01:07:23,501 --> 01:07:26,110
which is very much the egyptian creation
myth,

1184
01:07:26,111 --> 01:07:27,760
by the way,
the lion king,

1185
01:07:27,761 --> 01:07:28,800
the,
uh,

1186
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:33,820
what's the old guy's name now will blind
you remember

1187
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:37,510
he has a brother,
right?

1188
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:41,320
What's his brother scar?
And what's the problem with scar?

1189
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,290
He's scarred,
right?

1190
01:07:44,291 --> 01:07:44,801
So,
you know,

1191
01:07:44,801 --> 01:07:45,990
he's,
he's had,

1192
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,130
he's,
he says he's,

1193
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:50,530
he's from the bottom of the gene pool 
and you know,

1194
01:07:50,531 --> 01:07:53,620
he's,
he's been in second place all his life,

1195
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:55,900
but that's not any.
Andy's very,

1196
01:07:55,901 --> 01:07:58,450
very intelligent.
He worships his own intelligence.

1197
01:07:58,451 --> 01:08:00,730
He regards himself as a higher form of 
intellect,

1198
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:04,990
which is very common characteristic of 
evil brothers in mythology.

1199
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,824
And there's a reason for that.
And he's scarred because life has 

1200
01:08:09,401 --> 01:08:13,030
scarred him and he's bitter and 
resentful and he wants to bring down the

1201
01:08:13,031 --> 01:08:15,260
order and he wants to kill the son of 
the king.

1202
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,790
I mean,
he's a bad guy.

1203
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:21,000
Now the problem is,
is that mufasa underestimates,

1204
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:26,470
and that's exactly what happens to us.
Cyrus cyrus has this brother sat or seth

1205
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:28,753
and I have a sneaking suspicion that r 
word set for setting sun is from that 

1206
01:08:32,451 --> 01:08:34,520
word.
Although I don't know that for sure,

1207
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,970
but sounds or are generally,
um,

1208
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:39,773
sounds language remains stable across a 
very long period of time and set was 

1209
01:08:42,981 --> 01:08:45,470
definitely from the egyptian 
perspective,

1210
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:50,710
the enemy of the sun.
So that's part of the egyptian cosmology

1211
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:52,453
and the sun is associated with 
illumination and brightness and daytime 

1212
01:08:55,521 --> 01:08:58,730
consciousness and clear apprehension and
vision and all of those things.

1213
01:08:58,731 --> 01:08:59,564
And of course the night is opposed to 
that unconsciousness and blindness and 

1214
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:05,300
danger and all of those things.
So.

1215
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:06,860
So anyway,
seth,

1216
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,430
he's pretending to be,
oh,

1217
01:09:08,431 --> 01:09:10,790
cyrus's loving brother,
but he's not.

1218
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:14,960
He's plotting to overthrow the first 
chance she gets.

1219
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,350
And so he's just sitting in the 
background feeding him bad advice,

1220
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:21,860
waiting for waiting for him to get weak 
enough so that he can strike.

1221
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:27,250
Now the name Set is taken by the 
egyptian coptics and turned into satan.

1222
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:31,430
So sap is the precursor of the christian
state.

1223
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:32,623
So you can.
The reason I'm telling you that is so 

1224
01:09:34,011 --> 01:09:39,011
that you can see how these ideas,
these archetypal ideas of corruption and

1225
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:40,363
evil are are extraordinarily ancient and
they're part of the process whereby 

1226
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,053
people are trying to figure out what the
right way is to act and what the wrong 

1227
01:09:50,121 --> 01:09:50,954
way is to act and what the right way is 
to set up institutions and what the 

1228
01:09:53,721 --> 01:09:57,680
wrong way is to set up institutions.
So it's a very,

1229
01:09:57,681 --> 01:10:01,730
very long process and it's not something
that someone just sat around and thought

1230
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:02,660
up.
It's way,

1231
01:10:02,661 --> 01:10:03,770
way deeper than that.

1232
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,450
So anyways.
Oh,

1233
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:09,310
cyrus is being,
you know,

1234
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:11,450
getting weaker and being blind in one 
day.

1235
01:10:11,451 --> 01:10:12,081
Seth,
thanks.

1236
01:10:12,081 --> 01:10:14,390
All right.
Time for action.

1237
01:10:14,391 --> 01:10:17,360
So he takes his brother and he chops it 
up into little pieces.

1238
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:22,730
Now cyrus is a god,
so you're not going to kill them,

1239
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,730
but you can make it very difficult for 
him to get his act together.

1240
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,830
Now.
So basically what happens is,

1241
01:10:27,831 --> 01:10:29,570
oh,
cyrus falls apart.

1242
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:33,740
Now think aBout that.
You fall apart.

1243
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:37,760
People say that the relatIonship fell 
apart.

1244
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:40,310
It fell apart.
Things fall apart.

1245
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:42,800
What does that mean?
Well,

1246
01:10:42,801 --> 01:10:43,634
it means that a thing is usually a 
complex unity of multiple sub entities 

1247
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:50,263
and sometimes what holds them together,
the superordinate structure collapses 

1248
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:58,640
and all that's left are the things you 
know because like when you fall apart,

1249
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:01,870
you don't completely fall apart,
you know,

1250
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:02,733
you're still alive.
What's happened is that the unity of 

1251
01:11:05,301 --> 01:11:06,134
your psychological structure as being 
fragmented and that's a trip to the 

1252
01:11:08,961 --> 01:11:09,830
underworld,
man.

1253
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:11,053
So you're going to be unhappy.
I broke up with my partner and then I 

1254
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:16,890
fell apart.
While everyone knows what that means.

1255
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:18,990
Okay?
So that's what happened to cyrus.

1256
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:21,830
Things fall apart.
So,

1257
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:22,893
so then seth,
being a sneaky sort of character takes 

1258
01:11:26,251 --> 01:11:29,160
all of those cyrus's pieces and he puts 
them all over Egypt.

1259
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:29,994
He hides them in here and there.
So that was cyrus is gonna have a hell 

1260
01:11:33,301 --> 01:11:34,134
of a time recollecting himself and 
getting his act together and coming 

1261
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:40,860
back.
And so things fall apart.

1262
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,070
Now the same thing happens in the lion 
king,

1263
01:11:44,071 --> 01:11:46,880
obviously because scar kills us.

1264
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:48,443
So,

1265
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:55,010
so fine.
The insets rules,

1266
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:55,963
that's not a good day for the egyptians.
You remember what happens in the lion 

1267
01:11:58,881 --> 01:11:59,714
king when scar rules,
the environment becomes completely 

1268
01:12:03,411 --> 01:12:05,810
devastated because they overhand,
right?

1269
01:12:05,811 --> 01:12:08,150
So you get total environmental 
devastation.

1270
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:09,323
It's all black and burnt and you know,
nothing is functioning properly and 

1271
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:17,120
remember after sin,
but comes back to set things right?

1272
01:12:17,121 --> 01:12:19,150
It starts to rain and everything comes 
back.

1273
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,170
It comes back to life.
Well,

1274
01:12:21,171 --> 01:12:22,004
it's another indication of the idea that
you really can't separate the 

1275
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:26,900
environment from the culture.
You know,

1276
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:27,963
they're,
they're,

1277
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:31,760
they're in a dynamic system of 
interaction anyways.

1278
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:32,570
Oh,
cyrus,

1279
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:35,260
things have fallen apart.
Well,

1280
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:37,580
cyrus has a wife.
He has to.

1281
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,830
He's king of order.
While we're missing someone,

1282
01:12:40,831 --> 01:12:41,664
we're missing the queen of chaos.
We're missing the queen of the 

1283
01:12:43,491 --> 01:12:44,960
underworld.
That's isis.

1284
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:47,750
Now.
Isis was a long lasting goddess.

1285
01:12:47,751 --> 01:12:52,310
There's been goddess religions forever.
There's an idea among

1286
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:56,053
misinformed feminist anthropologists 
that the original religious structures 

1287
01:13:00,471 --> 01:13:04,100
were feminine earth goddess,
tight religions,

1288
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:05,113
and then they were replaced by 
patriarchal religious and there's no 

1289
01:13:08,391 --> 01:13:09,224
historical evidence for that.
And the basket work I know on that is 

1290
01:13:13,071 --> 01:13:16,700
actually through the unions.
I'm young and Eric Norman,

1291
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:17,563
because what they figured out,
they were kind of on the same track 

1292
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:23,690
thinking about the same idea that there 
seemed to be a shift between matriarchal

1293
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:27,200
values to patriarchal values and that 
that was a historical shift,

1294
01:13:27,201 --> 01:13:31,910
but what they found Instead was that 
that's actually a mythological idea.

1295
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:36,470
It's not a historical reality and it's 
useful as a mythological idea,

1296
01:13:36,471 --> 01:13:37,304
but you shouldn't project it backwards 
onto time and make it a historical 

1297
01:13:39,891 --> 01:13:41,810
reality.
So anyways,

1298
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:43,483
isis,
she's been queen of the underworld 

1299
01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:45,980
forever.
Now,

1300
01:13:45,981 --> 01:13:48,320
of course,
when order collapses,

1301
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:50,450
chaos reappears,
and that's what happens.

1302
01:13:50,451 --> 01:13:55,190
isis pops up out of the underworld and 
her husband's missing and she's not very

1303
01:13:55,191 --> 01:13:56,024
happy about that.
So she wanders all over Egypt looking 

1304
01:13:58,881 --> 01:13:59,714
for his fellas.
And so now that's an interesting idea 

1305
01:14:04,130 --> 01:14:04,963
because
it touches on like the biology of 

1306
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:11,203
innovation in some sense.
So you've heard of the notion of a 

1307
01:14:14,021 --> 01:14:16,270
seminal idea.
Well,

1308
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,313
that's an,
that's a mythologically informed 

1309
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:21,093
metaphor.
And so the idea is that in biological 

1310
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:29,730
biological reproduction,
semen falls on fertile ground and out of

1311
01:14:30,011 --> 01:14:31,480
that something emerges.

1312
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:32,893
Well,

1313
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:37,293
there's a tight analog between that and 
what happens in the egyptian myth with 

1314
01:14:41,141 --> 01:14:41,974
regards to sexuality now young and freud
had a big argument about this because 

1315
01:14:45,821 --> 01:14:46,654
freud thought you could reduce 
everything to sexuality and freud and 

1316
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:52,420
freud said that and said,
no,

1317
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:53,254
no.
What you don't understand Is that 

1318
01:14:54,251 --> 01:14:55,084
sexuality itself is often used as a 
symbol for something even more profound 

1319
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:02,410
and they didn't agree on that and that's
part of the way they went.

1320
01:15:02,411 --> 01:15:03,244
Their separate ways.
You freud was very much unwilling to 

1321
01:15:05,981 --> 01:15:10,981
believe that religion could be anything 
other than a like a set of defensive and

1322
01:15:12,401 --> 01:15:13,234
repressive beliefs and practices 
designed to protect you from death 

1323
01:15:17,381 --> 01:15:20,920
anxiety.
That was basically his hypothesis and

1324
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,630
and it's wrong.
It's not.

1325
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:26,523
I mean there is that element of course,
because you can use dogs to protect 

1326
01:15:29,231 --> 01:15:31,570
yourself against all sorts of things you
don't want to think about,

1327
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,660
but you can't reduce the whole damn 
thing too.

1328
01:15:34,661 --> 01:15:35,494
That you want to watch people of any 
type that are intellectuals who will 

1329
01:15:40,991 --> 01:15:44,590
tell you that everything can be reduced 
to one cause.

1330
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,960
You know,
it's like a misplaced monotheism.

1331
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:48,863
Lots of people do that for marx,
it's economics or class warfare for 

1332
01:15:51,911 --> 01:15:53,050
freud,
it sexuality,

1333
01:15:53,051 --> 01:15:56,380
although he also considers aggression 
for foodco its power,

1334
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:57,251
you know,
it's like,

1335
01:15:57,251 --> 01:15:59,560
no,
it's not that simple.

1336
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:00,873
You can make a good story out of those 
motivations because they're powerful 

1337
01:16:03,221 --> 01:16:05,020
motivations and they do affect 
everything,

1338
01:16:05,021 --> 01:16:06,700
but that doesn't mean they cause 
everything.

1339
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:08,950
Unit dementia.
okay,

1340
01:16:08,951 --> 01:16:10,630
so anyways,
isis pops up.

1341
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:11,740
Can we?
The underworld,

1342
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,550
seth takes control.
Chaos emerges from the underworld.

1343
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:19,750
isis wonders around.
She finds it was cyrus says,

1344
01:16:19,751 --> 01:16:21,700
fellas,
and she makes herself pregnant.

1345
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:23,650
Well,
so what does that mean?

1346
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,930
Well,
it means a lot of things.

1347
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:29,470
One thing it means is that if a great 
system falls apart,

1348
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:34,510
the parts still have life and you know,
you can think about that.

1349
01:16:34,511 --> 01:16:38,740
People often talk about the stability to
the degree that it's stable.

1350
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:44,010
part of the stability of capitalism is 
it's creative destruction,

1351
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:49,360
is that capitalism allows great 
enterprises to collapse and disperse,

1352
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:54,100
but they don't break down into subatomic
particles,

1353
01:16:54,101 --> 01:16:55,090
right?
They collapsed,

1354
01:16:55,091 --> 01:16:58,120
but the pieces they collapse into still 
has have life.

1355
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:01,210
Some of them more than others.
And then if something collapses,

1356
01:17:01,211 --> 01:17:02,044
sometimes part of the thing that 
collapsed has enough life to build 

1357
01:17:05,321 --> 01:17:06,154
something new out of the pieces.
That's the same thing that happens to 

1358
01:17:09,261 --> 01:17:10,094
you when you go through,
undergo a radical revolutionary 

1359
01:17:13,041 --> 01:17:14,690
transformation in your character.

1360
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:15,943
You know you might even feel like you're
dying and in some sense the organizing 

1361
01:17:21,231 --> 01:17:24,920
principles by which you lived are dying.
That's what's taking you out.

1362
01:17:24,921 --> 01:17:26,300
And it's,
it's painful.

1363
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,820
You know those things are alive.
It's no,

1364
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:32,150
no trivial matter that can be taken 
apart.

1365
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:35,810
But you know,
you hope that you get taken apart.

1366
01:17:35,811 --> 01:17:38,930
You can find some new information down 
there and the chaos,

1367
01:17:38,931 --> 01:17:39,764
and that's your union with isis,
roughly speaking and out of that union 

1368
01:17:43,941 --> 01:17:48,110
of information from the chaos and the 
parts of you that are left,

1369
01:17:48,111 --> 01:17:50,540
you can come springing back and you 
know,

1370
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:53,150
everyone hopes that.
And often it's the case.

1371
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:54,693
You know,
one of the lessons you can derive from 

1372
01:17:56,151 --> 01:18:01,010
Egypt and mythology is bloody well,
stay awake and make the corrections when

1373
01:18:01,011 --> 01:18:01,844
you need to.
Don't be willfully blind because if 

1374
01:18:03,711 --> 01:18:05,130
you're willfully blind,
you're going to,

1375
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:08,390
you're going to store up chaos because 
you're not,

1376
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:09,413
you know,
keeping at bay and then one day when 

1377
01:18:11,211 --> 01:18:13,340
you're weak,
it's just going to take you out.

1378
01:18:13,850 --> 01:18:16,250
And that happens.
That happens to people all the time.

1379
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:17,403
You know,
they,

1380
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,433
they let things around them degenerate 
back into chaos and then one day their 

1381
01:18:23,871 --> 01:18:26,900
week and something else comes along to 
hit them and they're done.

1382
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:28,700
They can't get up.
It's too heavy,

1383
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:29,713
it's too hard to hit,
and so then they're down in the 

1384
01:18:31,311 --> 01:18:32,144
underworld and they stay there.
So the general rule is if you're going 

1385
01:18:37,221 --> 01:18:38,054
to go to the underworld,
it's better to go on purpose and for 

1386
01:18:39,891 --> 01:18:40,724
short voyages.
And that's the idea behind voluntary 

1387
01:18:43,641 --> 01:18:44,780
exposure,
right?

1388
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:46,243
Find out what you don't want to look at.
It's easy enough to do that because 

1389
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:50,900
you're going to see yourself avoiding 
it.

1390
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:54,290
Then figure out how you can approach it 
in an order.

1391
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:55,280
Some of it,
you know,

1392
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:59,630
in this big chunks as you can manage and
do that all the time,

1393
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:00,883
stay awake because then you keep your 
infrastructure properly maintained and 

1394
01:19:05,811 --> 01:19:09,800
the probability that you'll be able to 
tolerate a powerful blow is much,

1395
01:19:09,801 --> 01:19:10,550
much higher.

1396
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:13,220
It's not certain.
That's the other thing about myths.

1397
01:19:13,221 --> 01:19:14,054
You know,
they tell you the best way to negotiate 

1398
01:19:16,221 --> 01:19:17,054
through life,
but they never tell you that that will 

1399
01:19:19,131 --> 01:19:22,220
work.
They just tell you that that's your best

1400
01:19:22,230 --> 01:19:23,720
bet.
And so,

1401
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:25,850
you know,
maybe that's not.

1402
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:28,460
It might be enough.
Okay.

1403
01:19:28,461 --> 01:19:30,890
So anyways,
isis finds,

1404
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:31,773
oh,
cyrus's fellas and gets pregnant and 

1405
01:19:34,581 --> 01:19:35,414
then back to the underworld.
She goes and she goes through her 

1406
01:19:38,301 --> 01:19:41,600
pregnancy and she gives birth to horace.
Now that's a pretty common story,

1407
01:19:41,601 --> 01:19:44,120
right?
That's the long lost.

1408
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:47,600
Rightful king.
King arthur,

1409
01:19:47,601 --> 01:19:48,434
for example,
arthur asked to be taken away from the 

1410
01:19:50,421 --> 01:19:53,060
castle to be raised basically in 
isolation.

1411
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,860
It's a very,
very common story.

1412
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,920
And the reason,
the same thing happens to Harry Potter,

1413
01:19:57,950 --> 01:19:58,783
right?
Harry potter is stuck with these 

1414
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:01,840
dursleys and you know,
they're just,

1415
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:08,460
they're like every resentful child's 
image of their parents,

1416
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:09,863
you know,
so maybe it's more like every resentful 

1417
01:20:11,851 --> 01:20:14,790
13 year olds image of their parents and 
you know,

1418
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:17,930
the truth of the matter is,
is you are a current stock off in a

1419
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:23,130
normative wastelands of your culture.
You know,

1420
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:25,140
you,
you have your specific parents.

1421
01:20:25,141 --> 01:20:29,290
They're not archetipal representatives 
of reality there.

1422
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:32,340
They're your parents,
their nature and culture,

1423
01:20:32,341 --> 01:20:35,820
but in,
in finite and flawed human form.

1424
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:37,043
And what that means in part is you are 
raised outside the domain of your 

1425
01:20:42,571 --> 01:20:43,830
culture.
It's old.

1426
01:20:43,831 --> 01:20:47,640
It isn't working very well and it's not 
transmitted very well to you.

1427
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:50,550
So you grew up outside of it.
You're alienated from it.

1428
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:54,090
That's that existentially.
But people always felt

1429
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,433
existential alienation.
People have always felt alienated from 

1430
01:20:59,141 --> 01:21:04,141
their damn culture because it's old and 
it's sort of blind and there you are,

1431
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:08,620
young and dynamic and full of life and 
all it's doing is telling you you can do

1432
01:21:08,621 --> 01:21:10,780
this and you can't do that.
You know,

1433
01:21:10,781 --> 01:21:14,230
lying to you about some things and doing
it pretty nasty job of others.

1434
01:21:14,231 --> 01:21:17,290
And so your own side,
you know when you're alienated from it.

1435
01:21:17,291 --> 01:21:20,230
And that's what happens to horace.
He's outside in not world.

1436
01:21:20,231 --> 01:21:23,680
That's where he gets bored.
And so that's where thinking about too.

1437
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,650
Anyways,
he grows up.

1438
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:29,320
Now horace is an interesting sort of 
character.

1439
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:32,950
So you've all seen the image of the 
egyptian.

1440
01:21:32,951 --> 01:21:35,500
I right.
Everyone knows that image even now,

1441
01:21:35,501 --> 01:21:37,230
which is pretty cool.
So it's got a,

1442
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:38,523
an eyebrow and it,
it's got an eye in the middle and then 

1443
01:21:40,091 --> 01:21:40,924
it's got the iris and usually the pupil 
is so big that it covers the whole iris 

1444
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:47,230
and there's a variety of reasons for 
that.

1445
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:51,250
But one of the reasons is is that that 
symbolize interest and attention.

1446
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,100
So when you're interested in something,
your pupil grows.

1447
01:21:54,370 --> 01:21:55,203
And so horace,
his pupil is really big and he's 

1448
01:21:56,771 --> 01:21:57,604
checking things out like matt.
So horace is the eye and he's aLso a 

1449
01:22:01,010 --> 01:22:03,190
falcon.
And you might say,

1450
01:22:03,191 --> 01:22:04,024
well why is he a falcon?
And the answer to that is falcons are 

1451
01:22:06,581 --> 01:22:07,414
birds of prey and they can really see.
So that's another amplification of the 

1452
01:22:12,791 --> 01:22:14,890
idea of the art.
Now,

1453
01:22:14,891 --> 01:22:19,810
falcons fly up above everything,
even above the pyramids and they can see

1454
01:22:19,811 --> 01:22:22,720
wherever they want to see.
And so horace is the thing.

1455
01:22:22,721 --> 01:22:23,554
That's why he's up above the structures 
of mankind in some sense and can see 

1456
01:22:27,431 --> 01:22:28,264
them panoramic lee.
So he's not encapsulated in any 

1457
01:22:31,361 --> 01:22:34,660
particular pyramid.
He's the thing that's above all pyramids

1458
01:22:34,661 --> 01:22:37,780
and looking and,
and providing you with an overview.

1459
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:39,363
All right,
so and I think the best way to 

1460
01:22:40,991 --> 01:22:44,680
conceptualize horse in modern terms is 
his attention.

1461
01:22:45,610 --> 01:22:49,090
That's not thought.
That's a whole different thing.

1462
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:54,510
I get tension is what thought.
Attention is the precursor to thought in

1463
01:22:55,151 --> 01:22:58,630
a sense,
attention is where you meet meaning.

1464
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:00,590
That's another way of thinking about it.
You know,

1465
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:01,833
attention is actually where you take 
undifferentiated and start to turn it 

1466
01:23:06,431 --> 01:23:07,264
into order.
And do you think about how much do you 

1467
01:23:08,831 --> 01:23:12,070
like being paid attention to?
People love that.

1468
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,820
Children like you don't pay attention,
then they become pathological.

1469
01:23:15,821 --> 01:23:18,460
You don't pay attention to your partner,
your relationship dissolves.

1470
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,700
No one pays attention to you.
You crawl off in a corner and die.

1471
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:26,050
Advertisers pay for your attention.
I like attention.

1472
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,030
That's a currency.
Now that's value,

1473
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:29,553
so you know,
and you like to be paid attention to 

1474
01:23:33,061 --> 01:23:34,390
you.
When you do good things,

1475
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:37,330
maybe you'll even do terrible things so 
that someone pays attention to you.

1476
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,600
Attention is a big deal.
We don't understand it very well,

1477
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:41,463
but anyways,
that the egyptians conceptualized it as 

1478
01:23:44,231 --> 01:23:46,270
a god not.
So that's smart.

1479
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:48,670
That's a very smart idea.
Anyways,

1480
01:23:48,671 --> 01:23:51,630
horace grows up in the underworld and 
then you know,

1481
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:55,450
when he gets kind of big and ready to 
contend with the world,

1482
01:23:55,451 --> 01:23:58,510
he thinks I'm going to take the damn 
state back for my eval.

1483
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:02,260
Uncle were all,
that's what you're supposed to do.

1484
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:05,500
You're supposed to grow up,
pay attention,

1485
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:07,510
get yourself the hell out of the 
underworld,

1486
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:11,410
and then take your state back from your 
evil uncle.

1487
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:13,130
Okay,
so what happened?

1488
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:15,310
So horse,
he gets himself all prepared and he's,

1489
01:24:15,311 --> 01:24:17,770
you know,
he's a son of order and chaos,

1490
01:24:17,771 --> 01:24:20,710
man.
He's no second grade character.

1491
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:25,480
You remember how many of you have seen 
the avengers movies?

1492
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:27,670
Okay.
okay.

1493
01:24:27,671 --> 01:24:32,170
So there's,
I think it's Samuel Jackson right now.

1494
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:36,610
Samuel jackson is often in the 
background and if I remember correctly,

1495
01:24:36,611 --> 01:24:40,840
he's kind of like the mediator between 
these shadowy figures that sort of exist

1496
01:24:40,841 --> 01:24:41,790
as,
I don't know.

1497
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,140
They look,
they all look like middle aged white men

1498
01:24:44,141 --> 01:24:48,520
and they're sort of like a power group 
and they communicate on screen.

1499
01:24:48,521 --> 01:24:53,110
I don't know exactly who they are,
but I'm jackson plays an intermediary,

1500
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:53,973
but he is lacking and I.
And part of the reason you infer that 

1501
01:24:57,521 --> 01:24:58,354
jackson is locking in eyes because he's 
at a pretty long history of being 

1502
01:25:02,171 --> 01:25:04,800
involved in catastrophe.
And you know,

1503
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:08,110
one consequence of that is that he's 
become damaged.

1504
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,240
Well,
the same thing happens to horace.

1505
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:15,250
So horace goes back and he says to seth,
I see you for who you are.

1506
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:19,030
I know what you're up to.
You're working for destruction.

1507
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:20,013
You want to take the state apart.
There's nothing positive about what 

1508
01:25:22,541 --> 01:25:23,110
you're doing.

1509
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:27,280
You facilitate deception.
So I'm taking the state max so they have

1510
01:25:27,281 --> 01:25:30,970
a big fight
and during the fight,

1511
01:25:30,971 --> 01:25:35,290
seth terrorists out one of horses eyes.
Now that'S we're thinking about too,

1512
01:25:35,291 --> 01:25:37,720
because what It means,
and this is exactly right,

1513
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:38,583
you know,
one of the things young set about 

1514
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:40,833
encountering malevolence is like let's 
say that you wanted to understand what 

1515
01:25:46,751 --> 01:25:50,740
the nazis did and so you started to take
it apart,

1516
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:51,603
you know,
and at each little bit of exploration 

1517
01:25:53,711 --> 01:25:57,070
you take it apart a little bit more 
deeply and then a little bit more deeply

1518
01:25:57,071 --> 01:25:59,740
and then a little bit more deeply,
you want to get to the bottom of it.

1519
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:01,630
Well,
you might ask yourself,

1520
01:26:01,631 --> 01:26:04,160
well,
what's at the bottom terrible things?

1521
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:07,100
Well,
the answer to that and answer to that is

1522
01:26:07,101 --> 01:26:07,934
the archetype of evil.
And if you are to the degree that you 

1523
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:17,471
encountered that,
even if you're capable of god,

1524
01:26:17,730 --> 01:26:20,380
like attention,
which is the case of horace,

1525
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:21,733
the probability is that that will be so 
devastating and it will destroy half 

1526
01:26:26,391 --> 01:26:27,380
your consciousness.

1527
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:28,603
That's what happens to horace.
And so like that's another thing I 

1528
01:26:30,831 --> 01:26:31,664
really like about the myths man there,
they don't mess around like you're 

1529
01:26:34,191 --> 01:26:35,024
supposed to come out of the underworld.
You're supposed to see what the hell is 

1530
01:26:37,131 --> 01:26:37,964
going on.
You're supposed to go back and take the 

1531
01:26:39,051 --> 01:26:39,884
state away from archaic.
It's archaic institutions and willful 

1532
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:46,370
blindness.
But if you really contend with that,

1533
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:47,473
you better look out because you're 
contending with something that you can 

1534
01:26:51,591 --> 01:26:53,840
barely master.
Anyways,

1535
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:54,674
horse eat seth,
despite the fact that he has is I tore 

1536
01:26:58,640 --> 01:26:59,473
an elk.
And so then he tells seth to go outside 

1537
01:27:01,581 --> 01:27:04,160
the boundaries of the kingdom and to 
never come back.

1538
01:27:06,310 --> 01:27:07,450
Well,
why doesn't he kill him?

1539
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:08,530
Well,
he can't.

1540
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,280
He's a garden.
You can't get rid of seth.

1541
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:14,890
Seth is the daddy of the decomposition 
of states.

1542
01:27:15,190 --> 01:27:16,023
That's not going away.
The best you can do is hold it at bay 

1543
01:27:19,511 --> 01:27:20,344
for periods of time and you have to be 
awake and aware of its constant 

1544
01:27:24,221 --> 01:27:26,020
presence.
Anyways,

1545
01:27:26,021 --> 01:27:28,150
he chased the step away,
but he gets his id back.

1546
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:31,113
And so he,
he reclaims his consciousness from the 

1547
01:27:35,321 --> 01:27:36,610
malevolent,
from,

1548
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:39,460
from malevolence essentially.
And then you might think,

1549
01:27:39,461 --> 01:27:40,870
okay,
well what should you do,

1550
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:44,560
you should slap that.
I back in his head and then you know,

1551
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:45,423
he's defeated evil,
so now he should be king and that would 

1552
01:27:47,681 --> 01:27:48,514
be a good ending to the story.
But that isn't what the egyptians do 

1553
01:27:50,501 --> 01:27:51,334
with mrs.
Where they really get brilliant in my 

1554
01:27:52,571 --> 01:27:53,404
estimation.

1555
01:27:56,420 --> 01:28:00,590
So horace takes his art and he goes back
to the underworld.

1556
01:28:00,591 --> 01:28:01,424
So he does this voluntarily.
It goes back to the underworld and he 

1557
01:28:04,191 --> 01:28:08,230
goes back to where was cyrus is existing
because it's sort of the land of the day

1558
01:28:08,231 --> 01:28:09,100
I did.
So I.

1559
01:28:09,210 --> 01:28:11,020
All.
Cyrus has this weird existence.

1560
01:28:11,021 --> 01:28:14,630
He scattered all over Egypt.
But his essence,

1561
01:28:14,631 --> 01:28:18,710
I suppose his spirit is down there in 
the underworld,

1562
01:28:18,711 --> 01:28:20,720
which is,
it's not exactly hell.

1563
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:22,543
Hell is a suburb of the underworld.
Like it's the worst neighborhood of the 

1564
01:28:25,851 --> 01:28:27,800
underworld.
That's a good way of thinking about it.

1565
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:30,110
You guys go to the underworld fairly 
often.

1566
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:35,060
You may take a rare side trip to hell 
and you probably regret it,

1567
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:37,150
but.
And we can,

1568
01:28:37,190 --> 01:28:38,023
we can talk about what that means 
because it actually has a very specific 

1569
01:28:40,131 --> 01:28:41,190
meaning anyways.
Oh,

1570
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:42,300
sorry.
Resistant inhale.

1571
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,390
He's just an underworld.
So he's sitting there sort of,

1572
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:48,560
you know,
inactive and,

1573
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:50,180
and in,
in rough shape.

1574
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:55,300
So horse goes down to the underworld and
he phones finds those cyrus and he gives

1575
01:28:56,391 --> 01:29:00,950
him an I.
And so then cyrus can see again,

1576
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:03,180
remember he couldn't see,
he was willfully blind,

1577
01:29:03,290 --> 01:29:04,123
right?
And so that's partly what led to his 

1578
01:29:05,221 --> 01:29:07,470
demise.
So horace gives him this guy that's been

1579
01:29:08,370 --> 01:29:10,530
hard fought,
right?

1580
01:29:10,531 --> 01:29:13,140
It's the eye with which he encountered 
evil.

1581
01:29:13,190 --> 01:29:16,470
He gives cyrus that I heard some write 
up.

1582
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:19,860
And so then horus and osiris go back to 
the surface.

1583
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:25,110
We're old and they unite to form the 
ruler of Egypt.

1584
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:27,533
And so the idea is that the proper ruler
is obviously the thing that can pay 

1585
01:29:31,321 --> 01:29:36,000
attention and conquer the pathology of 
the state and willful blindness.

1586
01:29:36,001 --> 01:29:38,400
But it's more than that.
It's the thing that does that.

1587
01:29:38,610 --> 01:29:42,120
And then rejuvenate's the state and you 
know,

1588
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:45,180
one of the things,
I think this is quite interesting.

1589
01:29:45,181 --> 01:29:46,014
So,

1590
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:47,730
um,

1591
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:53,690
the hippie culture in the 19 sixties 
was,

1592
01:29:53,770 --> 01:29:54,603
was a revolutionary culture and you can 
make a case that during the sixties and 

1593
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,800
in the latter part of the fifties that 
people,

1594
01:30:00,801 --> 01:30:05,030
young people's attention was very much 
focused on certain pathological elements

1595
01:30:05,031 --> 01:30:05,864
of the state,
know the civil rights movement seem to 

1596
01:30:08,601 --> 01:30:09,434
be a real thing.
There was a movement towards the 

1597
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:11,303
emancIpation of women.
There were lots of things that I think 

1598
01:30:14,151 --> 01:30:18,260
you can look at from a distance and say,
you know,

1599
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:19,213
good work.
But then there was the other element of 

1600
01:30:20,751 --> 01:30:21,980
It which was,
well,

1601
01:30:21,981 --> 01:30:22,814
you know,
down with the state and don't trust 

1602
01:30:26,181 --> 01:30:29,420
anyone over 30.
Well that's kind of stupid because first

1603
01:30:29,421 --> 01:30:29,991
of all,
you know,

1604
01:30:29,991 --> 01:30:32,360
it's not that long until you're 30 and 
then what do you do?

1605
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:33,830
And second,
it's like,

1606
01:30:33,950 --> 01:30:34,850
well,
no,

1607
01:30:34,851 --> 01:30:37,280
you can't throw the damn baby out with 
the bathwater.

1608
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:38,031
I mean,
first of all,

1609
01:30:38,031 --> 01:30:40,940
you're probably doing that because you 
don't want to grow up ever.

1610
01:30:41,090 --> 01:30:43,280
you're just peter pan.
And second.

1611
01:30:43,281 --> 01:30:44,114
It's like you can't leave ocirus length 
with cyrus languishing in the 

1612
01:30:49,071 --> 01:30:49,904
underworld.
You have to give them vision and bring 

1613
01:30:51,991 --> 01:30:56,480
them back up to the surface because I 
don't care how attentive you are,

1614
01:30:57,290 --> 01:30:58,123
if you're also not wise,
you're not going to be good for 

1615
01:30:59,841 --> 01:31:03,450
anything,
and the wisdom is partly the integration

1616
01:31:03,451 --> 01:31:04,284
of the best.
Your culture has to offer you into your 

1617
01:31:06,261 --> 01:31:07,094
character so that you can be an avatar 
of culture and attentive avatar of 

1618
01:31:11,241 --> 01:31:14,030
culture,
and then you're a well balanced soul.

1619
01:31:14,690 --> 01:31:15,523
Well,
so the egyptIans figured all this out 

1620
01:31:16,551 --> 01:31:17,384
and then it's even cooler than that 
because they use this idea of the union 

1621
01:31:23,361 --> 01:31:24,194
of horus and cyrus as their conceptual 
representation of what gave the feral 

1622
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:32,570
sovereignty,
which is because again,

1623
01:31:32,571 --> 01:31:34,550
like the mesopotamIans,
they were trying to figure out,

1624
01:31:34,551 --> 01:31:35,840
well,
what should rule,

1625
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:37,910
you know,
what should be above all,

1626
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:39,950
and the mesopotamians figured,
well,

1627
01:31:39,951 --> 01:31:41,020
it's something like marduk.

1628
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:42,710
He's got lots of eyes.
He can talk.

1629
01:31:42,711 --> 01:31:43,580
He's brave.
He'll,

1630
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,620
he'll conquer the unknown.
He makes things.

1631
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:48,110
As a consequence,
he makes a pretty good talk.

1632
01:31:48,111 --> 01:31:52,430
God and the egyptians added a level of 
sophistication to that because

1633
01:31:54,170 --> 01:31:57,590
horace is not only the thing that will 
go into the underworld.

1634
01:31:57,890 --> 01:32:00,610
He goes into the underworld,
he rescues things,

1635
01:32:00,611 --> 01:32:01,444
have tremendous value,
and then unites with them so that not 

1636
01:32:04,601 --> 01:32:08,020
only can he see,
but he's wise,

1637
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,510
and so then that's what the pharaoh was 
supposed to be in.

1638
01:32:10,511 --> 01:32:11,344
The egyptians basically characterized 
that union as something akin to the 

1639
01:32:14,321 --> 01:32:18,640
immortal soul.
Now eliana tracks this development.

1640
01:32:18,641 --> 01:32:21,790
He called the democratization of osiris.
So first of all,

1641
01:32:22,150 --> 01:32:25,820
basically only the pharaoh was allowed 
to be the horace.

1642
01:32:25,821 --> 01:32:28,180
So cyrus union in some sense,
you know,

1643
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:31,750
so and in,
in a way he was god on earth,

1644
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:34,670
you know,
and which is a conception of course,

1645
01:32:34,671 --> 01:32:36,610
that this lasted into cultures for a 
very,

1646
01:32:36,611 --> 01:32:37,600
very long period of time.

1647
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:38,433
The japanese still thought that way 
about their emperor until the end of 

1648
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:43,180
world war two.
And many of them still think that way.

1649
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:46,390
So he was the embodiment of divine 
sovereignty.

1650
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:47,463
It was in the leader only,
but as the egyptian state developed the 

1651
01:32:51,461 --> 01:32:52,294
idea that that soul was an attribute 
started to descend down the power 

1652
01:32:56,561 --> 01:32:57,394
hierarchy.
So after awhile the aristocracy started 

1653
01:32:59,051 --> 01:33:01,840
to use it.
And then now,

1654
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:03,970
and this is a radical 
oversimplification,

1655
01:33:03,971 --> 01:33:05,530
but it'll do for the,
for the,

1656
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:08,600
for the purposes of this discussion,
you know,

1657
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:10,660
by the time the jews came along and they
come,

1658
01:33:10,661 --> 01:33:13,180
it came out of Egypt,
mythologically speaking,

1659
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:17,560
the idea that there could be a,
a,

1660
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:18,583
a union or a relationship between 
something that was divided in something 

1661
01:33:21,311 --> 01:33:25,030
that was individual was distributed a 
long ways down the power hierarchy.

1662
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:26,633
No.
And then by the time the greeks showed 

1663
01:33:27,731 --> 01:33:30,010
up,
well in some sense it was all males,

1664
01:33:30,011 --> 01:33:32,170
at least all males who were part of the 
polity.

1665
01:33:32,170 --> 01:33:35,200
And then when the christians emerged,
it was everyone,

1666
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:38,560
prostitutes,
tax collectors,

1667
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,150
thieves,
murderers,

1668
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:41,373
everyone.
and so the idea of sovereignty started 

1669
01:33:43,721 --> 01:33:44,770
to become,
you know,

1670
01:33:44,830 --> 01:33:46,960
first of all,
it was a mythological attribute,

1671
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:47,833
was identified with the ruler,
but then it became a psychological 

1672
01:33:50,771 --> 01:33:53,770
attribute that was distributed across 
the entire population.

1673
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:56,560
It's brilliant.
It's brilliant.

1674
01:33:56,830 --> 01:33:57,663
And as far as I can tell,
that's really those conceptualizations 

1675
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:03,940
form,
the substructure of our belief that each

1676
01:34:03,941 --> 01:34:06,930
person is divinely valuable.
You know,

1677
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:09,730
in their own right,
that they have inalienable rights.

1678
01:34:09,731 --> 01:34:11,110
Even if you're a murderer,
right?

1679
01:34:11,111 --> 01:34:14,350
The state is very restricted in what it 
can do to you.

1680
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:18,730
Even if you committed a terrible crime.
Even if you admit to it,

1681
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,200
the state is still very restricted in 
what it's allowed to do with you because

1682
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:24,243
there's an idea that there's something 
about you that has the quality of 

1683
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:30,790
transcendent value.

1684
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:34,990
That's exactly it and well we know some 
of the attributes,

1685
01:34:34,991 --> 01:34:35,824
you know,
one of them is the you can see and pay 

1686
01:34:37,151 --> 01:34:37,984
attention.
The other is that you can speak and 

1687
01:34:39,551 --> 01:34:43,150
communicate.
The other is that you can become wise,

1688
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:44,513
that you can approach things that 
frighten you with courage and generate 

1689
01:34:48,191 --> 01:34:49,024
new information as a consequence.
Like there's lots of things about you 

1690
01:34:51,221 --> 01:34:56,221
that the relationship between chaos and 
order actually literally dependent and,

1691
01:34:58,850 --> 01:35:01,820
aNd that's.
And so the state has come to respect the

1692
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:02,654
individual partly because the individual
is by necessity the thing that 

1693
01:35:06,981 --> 01:35:10,310
rejuvenates the state.
And so there's this dynamic relationship

1694
01:35:10,311 --> 01:35:12,260
between the two.
The state structures you,

1695
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:17,620
but it's old and blind and there's lots 
of things that can't see and it's partly

1696
01:35:17,691 --> 01:35:19,040
corrupt.
OKay.

1697
01:35:19,041 --> 01:35:20,900
But it's a hell of a lot better than 
nothing.

1698
01:35:20,990 --> 01:35:21,823
Generally speaking,
and so then you're like the forerunner 

1699
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:25,303
of the state and you can pay attention 
and maybe you can see where things 

1700
01:35:28,041 --> 01:35:31,550
aren't working exactly right where they 
don't working property and fix them,

1701
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:36,770
and so then the state maintains its 
protective structure across time and you

1702
01:35:36,771 --> 01:35:39,230
exist in a dialectical relationship with
it.

1703
01:35:39,670 --> 01:35:40,503
you know,
you see by the time the christian hero 

1704
01:35:42,951 --> 01:35:43,784
mythology emerges,
christ is more the [inaudible] 

1705
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:51,710
constructor of the state than he is the 
thing that it encounters chaos,

1706
01:35:51,711 --> 01:35:52,544
right?
because a huge chunk of the christian 

1707
01:35:53,871 --> 01:35:58,840
story is about the antagonism between 
him and his culture and,

1708
01:35:58,930 --> 01:35:59,763
and the roman culture as well.
So the whole existential drama actually 

1709
01:36:02,331 --> 01:36:04,190
shifts from,
you know,

1710
01:36:04,370 --> 01:36:08,630
hero as buttress against nature,
which of course would have been the case

1711
01:36:08,631 --> 01:36:09,464
earlier to hero as thing that decomposes
and reconstructs culture in a radical 

1712
01:36:14,091 --> 01:36:15,290
way.
So,

1713
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:18,060
you know,
moses does the same things and other and

1714
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:21,710
moses is a master of water.
He's a transformative agent.

1715
01:36:21,711 --> 01:36:25,040
So it's an indication of exactly the 
same sort of idea.

1716
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:27,513
Well,

1717
01:36:32,580 --> 01:36:33,870
it's a good time for a break.
