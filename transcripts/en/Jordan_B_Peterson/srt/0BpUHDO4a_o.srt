1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,580
I don't know how many of you got my 
email this morning,

2
00:00:04,581 --> 00:00:05,414
but this is the last class and so I sent
in my email a link to the other lecture 

3
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:12,134
that was supposed to happen,
but I have to go to a conference on 

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,793
Thursday and Friday and so I'm going to 
do the last lecture today and you can 

5
00:00:18,681 --> 00:00:21,920
watch the second glass lecture from last
year,

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,970
which will cover the territory hopefully
sufficiently well.

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,853
So
I usually use the last lecture to sort 

8
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:35,660
of sum up where we've been and also to 
talk to people about.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,120
Let me open that up here first

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,250
about my more specific thoughts on 
personality.

11
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,770
So I think that's probably what I'll do 
today.

12
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,650
I'll start with with what we've where 
we've been.

13
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,093
So

14
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,333
I started talking to you about 
mythological representations of 

15
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:53,121
personality
and I wanted to do that for a variety of

16
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:58,020
reasons,
but the most important was to place

17
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,473
the rest of the course in a,
a deep history context essentially 

18
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:10,190
because personality is the consequence 
of very many things and many of them are

19
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:17,160
grounded in our biology and therefore 
grounded in evolution.

20
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,830
And I generally think that in some ways 
the social sciences don't take evolution

21
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:27,270
seriously enough,
you know,

22
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:28,104
they don't,
they don't take the fact that we're 

23
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,500
three and a half billion years old,
seriously enough.

24
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:39,501
It's a serious thing.
And some of that is evident

25
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,790
in a relatively straightforward way 
conceptually in that we share so much of

26
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:50,280
our biological platform with other 
creatures.

27
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,180
You know,
there was a recent genomic analysis,

28
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:55,014
I think,
of gorillas and I don't remember what 

29
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,100
percentage of our dna we share with 
gorillas,

30
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:03,010
but it's like 99 point two percent or 
something like that,

31
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,010
which you know,
is quite shocking until you realize that

32
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:09,640
we share about 70 percent of our genetic
makeup with yeast.

33
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,830
So,
you know,

34
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:14,470
yeah,
obviously we're a lot closer to gorillas

35
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,603
than to yeast,
but we're still a pretty damn close to 

36
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:18,274
yeast.
And it also indicates not necessarily 

37
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:24,220
how,
just how similar we are,

38
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:25,054
two gorillas,
but how minor modifications in the 

39
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,760
genome can also make substantial 
differences because like as we are,

40
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,960
two gorillas were a lot different from 
them too.

41
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,783
So.

42
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,740
So there's the biological aspect,
which is really important.

43
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,620
But then there's what you might describe
as a quasi biological element,

44
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,483
which seems to be operating in the space
between biology as evolutionarily 

45
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:57,700
determined that culture,
those things are often,

46
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,773
you know,
we have an archetypal tendency to 

47
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:04,540
consider culture as something in 
opposition to nature.

48
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,090
And there's utility in that from a 
heuristic point of view.

49
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,780
You can do a lot without division from a
conceptual perspective.

50
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,453
But in lots of ways it's misleading
because some of the primordial elements 

51
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:24,691
of culture or biological.
And I think the most striking example of

52
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:30,391
that fundamentally is
there's two striking examples.

53
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,104
One is
the existence of structures of power or 

54
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,030
structures of authority or structures of
influence,

55
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,210
hierarchies which are incredibly old,
at least 400 million years old and,

56
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,910
and which have in consequence being 
around for so long that you also have to

57
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:56,020
think about them as part of the 
environment.

58
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,030
Part of nature,
you know,

59
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:58,864
because we tend to think of the 
hierarchical structure as cultural and 

60
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:04,714
also as easily alterable in some sense.
But there's no reason to think that 

61
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:10,863
given that it's been around,
as I pointed out in one lecture longer 

62
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:17,110
than trees,
you know,

63
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:17,944
it's a very,
very permanent element of the 

64
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:22,210
environment that human beings find 
themselves in.

65
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,613
So much so that you know,
you can think of a dominance hierarchy 

66
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:27,154
as the prototype prototype of culture,
but because it's been a constant 

67
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:32,194
environmental feature for so long,
our nervous systems are built for 

68
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:39,070
operation within a hierarchy and they're
really built that way.

69
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:44,071
It's not a trivial matter because you 
know the serotonin systems that regulate

70
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,850
our emotions because the serotonin 
system does that fundamentally.

71
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,930
It's also the system that sets up your 
brain during fetal development.

72
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,393
The serotonin system is above all 
perhaps concerned with calibrating your 

73
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:00,134
nervous system in accordance with your 
position in a hierarchy and it's basic 

74
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:08,390
rule is the higher in the hierarchy you 
are,

75
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,763
the less negative emotion you have to 
feel and the lower in a hierarchy you 

76
00:06:13,431 --> 00:06:18,431
are and the more tenuous your actual 
life because there's a direct connection

77
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:19,274
between the tenuousness of your life and
your position in the dominance 

78
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:22,904
hierarchy.

79
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:23,983
The more negative emotion you're going 
to feel and then not have drastic 

80
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:31,781
consequences and those are our best 
exemplified in longevity.

81
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,660
So there was a famous study called the 
Whitehall study,

82
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,940
which was done in Britain and basically 
what they were looking at,

83
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:41,923
the researchers were looking at was 
health including mortality of English 

84
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:50,930
civil servants in the first study was 
done 50 years before the second study.

85
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,690
I think the second study was done in the
eighties.

86
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,320
Anyways,
in the first study,

87
00:06:57,321 --> 00:07:01,070
you have a power hierarchy and home with
the top civil servants at the talk,

88
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,913
obviously in the bottom civil servants 
out the bottom and you know you might 

89
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,373
ask yourself what constitutes top and 
bottom and some of it might be regarded 

90
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:16,100
as autonomy over choices and then that.
So that would be part of it.

91
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,240
You can make choices so you have a bit 
more control over what's going to happen

92
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:23,510
to you,
but also the probability that you have a

93
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:26,720
stable and productive place is higher.

94
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,583
The higher you go and lower the lower 
you go and the consequences of that all 

95
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:34,130
things considered is that the civil 
servants out the bottom of the dominance

96
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:34,964
hierarchy died,
are younger and more frequently than 

97
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:39,734
those at the top.
Now you could attribute that to poverty 

98
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,510
relevant to poverty,
right?

99
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:47,540
Because of the people at the bottom,
especially say in the 19 thirties,

100
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,500
were materially deprived in comparison 
to the people at the top.

101
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:55,370
Although they certainly weren't 
materially deprived in comparison,

102
00:07:55,371 --> 00:08:00,110
say to UK citizens a hundred years 
before or to most people in the world at

103
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:01,970
that time.
So,

104
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,770
uh,
poverty argument is hard to make.

105
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:05,900
Although what relative poverty argument 
is,

106
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,943
is easier to make,
but then 50 years later Britain was a 

107
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:11,654
lot richer.
And so the absolute level of wealth of 

108
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,374
the entire hierarchy moved up 
substantially so that the people at the 

109
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:19,904
bottom,
we're richer than the people at the 

110
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:24,530
middle in the previous study.

111
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,090
But the pattern of overall overall 
mortality remained quite similar.

112
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:30,723
And you know,
the importance of studies like that as 

113
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:38,741
well as studies that indicate the 
consequence of income inequality on,

114
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,303
on behavior are so important that they 
should be put front and center in 

115
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,480
university curricula.
I mean,

116
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:48,314
one of the things that really bothers me
about the humanities education in 

117
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:53,084
particular,
although some of the social science 

118
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:55,004
education too for modern university 
students is there are some things we 

119
00:08:57,841 --> 00:09:01,470
know that you're never taught and it's 
really appalling,

120
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,543
especially the relative poverty issue 
because most of the phenomena that 

121
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,830
people tend to attribute to poverty has 
nothing to do with poverty.

122
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,993
It's relative poverty.
And that is absolutely not the same 

123
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:19,320
thing because the first one is a 
material deprivation hypothesis.

124
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,393
But if you think about it,
there's almost no one in North America 

125
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,900
whose material lead deprived.
Now you know,

126
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,000
you could become mit.

127
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,980
And I'm not saying there's no one,
I'm saying there's almost no one.

128
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,173
And you know,
it also depends on your definition of 

129
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:36,720
material deprivation.
But most people,

130
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:41,190
the vast majority of people have too 
much to eat and a place to live.

131
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,353
And you know,
once you have plumbing and heating and 

132
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:46,254
food and access to information,
you've pretty much got everything that 

133
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,070
wealth can give you that isn't relative,
right?

134
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,160
The privation part of it is gone.
But relative poverty,

135
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,753
relative positions,
unbelievably powerful determinant of 

136
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,350
almost everything that you could 
imagine.

137
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,370
So longevity is one,
health is another.

138
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,930
Um,
and those are,

139
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,823
a lot of those are stress related.
It's a lot more stressful at the bottom 

140
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:14,244
than it is at the top.
I'll tell you something interesting we 

141
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:19,890
found out about conservatism,
and this is when I wrote,

142
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,260
I wrote a book called maps of meaning 
along while back.

143
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,093
And I realized that I was trying to 
account for why people are prone to 

144
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:31,230
identify so strongly with their belief 
systems,

145
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,064
you know,
and part of it in some sense was a 

146
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,040
control over negative outcomes 
hypothesis.

147
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:41,310
So partly if you have an ideological 
theory,

148
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,820
it's a set of tools that you can use 
quite with quite a bit of proficiency to

149
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:48,160
operate in the world,
right?

150
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:51,990
It's a simplification strategy,
enables you to control uncertainty.

151
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,270
It also enables you to communicate with 
people.

152
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,313
But even more importantly,
to the degree that we share a cultural 

153
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:02,820
system,
we can predict each other and that's not

154
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:03,654
psychological,
it's you act out the game and I act out 

155
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:06,354
the game and so I don't have to really 
know much about you and I don't have to 

156
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:10,644
assume that you're a barrel of snakes.
I can assume that you're more or less 

157
00:11:14,371 --> 00:11:14,970
like me.

158
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,210
And so if we interact,
I don't have to be on constant alert.

159
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:22,020
And so that's not a psychological 
function of a belief system.

160
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,350
That's a direct real world function.
And if you know,

161
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,140
if you listen to people like the terror 
management theorists,

162
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,243
they're always telling you how belief 
systems protect people against 

163
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:34,770
psychological uncertainty or maybe the 
the fear of death.

164
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,980
They never tell you that shared belief 
systems actually prevent you from death,

165
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,950
which is even more important than 
protecting you from the fear of death.

166
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,443
So there is the stabilization of society
aspect that that's a motivator for 

167
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,390
maintaining a set of shared beliefs 
because it kind of makes us identical,

168
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,270
which you might say is bad on the side 
of individuality.

169
00:11:58,271 --> 00:11:58,811
It's like,
yeah,

170
00:11:58,811 --> 00:11:59,440
yeah,
oh yeah.

171
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,273
Individuality,
it's really good on the side of not 

172
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:03,094
having to assume that the next person is
going to kill you and that's way more 

173
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:07,870
important than individuality.

174
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,263
You know,
the other thing I would like to make a 

175
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,180
case for briefly is that,
you know,

176
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,023
in the West,
people think Western people are 

177
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:17,320
individualistic.
That's the stupidest theory ever.

178
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:19,990
I think,
except for maybe the theory that poverty

179
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:22,480
is at the root of all these social 
problems that we see.

180
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,300
Western people are hardly individual at 
all.

181
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,840
All you have to do is go out and look at
traffic patterns to figure that out.

182
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,780
You know,
everybody stops at a red light.

183
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,870
Everybody crosses when the walk signal 
turns,

184
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,810
virtually everybody waits in line when 
there's,

185
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,673
you know,
a lineup for some restricted access 

186
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,480
event.
We all dress the same way.

187
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:45,220
Men and women alike,
you know,

188
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:47,830
we follow the rules like mad,
like crazy.

189
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,260
And then on top of that,
there's a bit of fluff,

190
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,890
you know,
which is the things we could do if we're

191
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,120
free,
which we can talk about and dream about,

192
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:58,060
but which hardly in what he does and 
that's what it looks like.

193
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,670
Individuality.
So you get that freedom.

194
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:04,270
But the cost of it is incredible 
obedience and bought,

195
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,133
you know,
the fact of the obedience is that while 

196
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:08,470
you could sit here,
for example,

197
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:11,080
and look at this,
it's all safe and everything and you can

198
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,530
come here with all these other weird 
primates and you don't know a damn thing

199
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:15,364
about them and you know,
they come from all sorts of different 

200
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:18,574
places,
but there's a shared social structure 

201
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:23,350
and everybody participates in the game 
and then all of a sudden,

202
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:24,790
you know,
it's basically safe.

203
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,550
Fine.
That's one reason for conservatism,

204
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,893
you know,
and for identification with the belief 

205
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:32,680
system,
it's like stabilize the damn game.

206
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:33,514
So you can predict the other primates.
And a lot of people who talk about 

207
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:37,564
conservatism as a political belief,
make the assumption that that control 

208
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:44,560
element is the fundamental motivator 
for,

209
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,713
for,
uh,

210
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,250
for right wing political belief.

211
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,113
But weirdly enough,
the other thing that happens when you 

212
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:55,810
stabilize a game,
let's say,

213
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,993
which would be a shared belief,
is that you provide a goal because a 

214
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,700
value system,
a shared value system,

215
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:06,610
is always oriented towards a goal.
Otherwise it's not a value system.

216
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:09,280
It's not a belief system.
And the thing is as soon as,

217
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:12,520
and this is a psg Eddie and point,
as soon as you organize something around

218
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:13,354
a goal,
you give people opportunity to do two 

219
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:17,380
things.
One,

220
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,070
three things cooperate within the rural 
framer,

221
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,113
compete within the rural framework.
So that brings into the possibility of 

222
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:25,954
victory and loss.
And also to experience some positive 

223
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:30,490
emotion.
Because like if,

224
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,443
if we haven't unified our game,
which is basically the job of a bloody 

225
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:37,930
three year old,
if we haven't unified our game.

226
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:38,973
And so we're each playing our own games.
There's no way that we can collectively 

227
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:45,940
aim at something and there's no way that
you can progress,

228
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,330
you know.

229
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,163
And so one of the things that when when 
you're taught about the oppressive 

230
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,300
structure,
say of the patriarchal system,

231
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:54,134
one of the things that's never noted is 
that because that's a hierarchical 

232
00:14:57,411 --> 00:14:58,244
system,
it's also a preconditioned for any kind 

233
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:01,664
of victory and that would even be 
victory over yourself if you want to be 

234
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:09,260
better tomorrow than you are today.
Basically what you're doing is aiming at

235
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:10,094
a point that's defined by the value 
system so that saving up and trying to 

236
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:16,920
move yourself towards it.
You get rid of that shared value system,

237
00:15:16,921 --> 00:15:20,330
but there's no structure for positive 
emotion anymore.

238
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,123
So part of the reason people want to 
stabilize their belief systems and so 

239
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:27,290
that the environment,
mostly other people,

240
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,183
but also the environment remains under 
control and thank God for that because 

241
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,550
otherwise it's just outright bloody 
chaos.

242
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,910
But the other reason is

243
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,620
no game,
no winners,

244
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,910
nothing to do,
no one.

245
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,093
That's I think why there's an orthogonal
relationship between agreeableness and 

246
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:52,564
conscientiousness.
Conscientiousness seems to do something 

247
00:15:55,691 --> 00:15:59,410
like stabilized rule structures across 
long periods of time.

248
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,453
So it kind of defines the game 
explicitly and that lays out the 

249
00:16:03,431 --> 00:16:06,490
possibility of a hierarchy and a value 
system.

250
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,080
And then agreeable just says,
hey,

251
00:16:08,081 --> 00:16:09,940
don't get too carried away with that.
You know,

252
00:16:09,941 --> 00:16:10,774
you don't want to make the game so damn 
tight that the losers stack up at zero 

253
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:16,210
and die.
So you know,

254
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:19,660
it's egalitarian isn't versus justice or
something like that.

255
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:22,060
That's not exactly.
But it's something like that.

256
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,030
You know,
everybody should go to university,

257
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,770
fine,
egalitarian,

258
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,533
presupposition.
The people who work hard and study 

259
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:32,074
should do better.
Well that's a presupposition of justice 

260
00:16:34,421 --> 00:16:35,980
and those aren't the same thing,
right?

261
00:16:35,981 --> 00:16:36,814
Actually,
they work somewhat in opposition to one 

262
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:38,710
another.

263
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,543
So you could say let everyone in.
You enter university and fail half of 

264
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:43,534
them in the first year.
And that's kind of what they do in 

265
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:46,380
places like Holland,
you know,

266
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:49,330
where we have fairly structured 
admission criteria,

267
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,570
but you know,
you can see the tension there because if

268
00:16:52,571 --> 00:16:53,404
you let everybody into university then 
the really smart people are being 

269
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:57,514
dragged for.
They're being put into a position where 

270
00:17:00,551 --> 00:17:04,270
they're able to advance much more slowly
than they would otherwise.

271
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:08,170
So that's a real price to pay at the top
of the distribution.

272
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,303
On the other hand,
you're opening up opportunities for 

273
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:11,584
people who for one reason or another 
might have not done well in high school 

274
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:17,290
or previously,
but could actually thrive in university.

275
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,600
But you see that those things,
you know,

276
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,490
there's two values structures.
They are,

277
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:22,324
it's not easy to optimize them.
And that's exactly why I think we have 

278
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:25,204
those two parallel personality 
dimensions and it's real hell when one 

279
00:17:27,731 --> 00:17:29,620
of them gets the upper hand,
you know,

280
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,400
part of it is balanced inclusion and 
hierarchy.

281
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,740
You need to have those things operating 
at the same time.

282
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,263
So.
So back to the mythological 

283
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:45,644
representations,
I mean partly what you see in 

284
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:52,181
mythological representations of reality 
and we have to talk about reality at the

285
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,304
have to,
is the presence of something that 

286
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,980
represents the hierarchy.
I would say,

287
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,790
you know,
in fairy tales,

288
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,430
that's often the cane wise,
king or otherwise.

289
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:06,264
And then in religious mythology it's 
usually something that represents the 

290
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:10,224
king or the father.
And I think that's because the primary 

291
00:18:12,931 --> 00:18:17,580
social hierarchies among human beings 
are masculine in nature.

292
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:23,570
And I think that's probably because 
while men are more like pack animals and

293
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,270
why aren't women?
Well,

294
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:32,550
I think the reason for that is is that 
the things that men did historically had

295
00:18:32,551 --> 00:18:33,384
a communal element,
like a goal directed communal element 

296
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,893
that wasn't as prevalent in female 
dominance hierarchies if something like 

297
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:45,771
that.
So there's a representation of that,

298
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,623
of the hierarchy,
but then there's a counter 

299
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:52,384
representation which is a representation
of the individual and that's another 

300
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,930
really tight melons that societies have 
to manage.

301
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,660
I don't want you to be too different 
because if you're too different,

302
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,993
I can't predict you and you may actually
be a threat to the integrity of the 

303
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:14,010
society because you might come up with 
something so wild and so on.

304
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:17,440
Unconstrained that it just blows the 
entire game into pieces.

305
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,760
On the other hand,

306
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,840
to the degree that I'm a rigid 
hierarchy,

307
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,913
I'm going to fall behind.
As the environment transforms and the 

308
00:19:26,561 --> 00:19:28,000
environment,
the natural environment,

309
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:28,834
let's say,
or the environment outside of the 

310
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,600
dominance hierarchy is also something 
that's stable.

311
00:19:31,601 --> 00:19:32,434
He represented mythologies.
So one of the things you see happening 

312
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:35,674
is there's a hierarchy and the other 
thing is there's a force outside the 

313
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,920
hierarchy and it's often represented by 
an eye.

314
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,353
So you see this in a variety of ancient 
myths and that represents the capacity 

315
00:19:46,841 --> 00:19:47,674
of the individual to pay attention and 
to maintain and update the hierarchy so 

316
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,520
you have this dance between the 
individual and the hierarchy,

317
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,753
hierarchy structures of the individual 
and disciplines them and produces a 

318
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:00,794
culture being.
But then hopefully the culture being 

319
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,000
kind of pops up above the hierarchy and 
then can start,

320
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,263
you know,
altering it hopefully relatively 

321
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:12,850
minimally where,
where it's necessary.

322
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,683
It's very much akin to piaget's idea 
that once children hit higher levels of 

323
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:19,690
moral development,
first of all,

324
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,640
they play alone,
then they can play with others,

325
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,533
then they know the rules,
and then morality is following the 

326
00:20:25,061 --> 00:20:26,980
rules.
And now after that I didn't.

327
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,550
And not every child gets to this point,
at least according to Piaget,

328
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,893
the child starts to regard him or her 
self as something that can make the 

329
00:20:35,231 --> 00:20:36,850
rules.
Right.

330
00:20:36,851 --> 00:20:37,684
So you could think about that as the 
Piaget did is the pinnacle of ethical 

331
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:41,794
development and whether or not that's 
the pinnacle is debatable because I 

332
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:49,780
think you'll see young extended that 
idea.

333
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:53,260
Although people never think about this 
as a variation on Piagetian theory.

334
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,800
So for Piaget,
once you hit individual status,

335
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:02,650
it's sort of you pop out of the group 
and then you hit individual status.

336
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,723
It's not like you're a rule breaker 
because you can follow the rules and 

337
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:09,610
usually do,
but you can observe them and modify them

338
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:10,444
when necessary.

339
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,553
It's almost exactly what your 
consciousness does to your own internal 

340
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:16,450
neural structure.
So for example,

341
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:18,660
imagine you're playing a piano,
you know,

342
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,513
and you've automatized most of it,
so you've built little machines in the 

343
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:24,550
back of your head to take care of the,
of the trills,

344
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:29,551
let's say in the Arpeggios and you make 
a mistake or your consciousness picks up

345
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:30,664
the mistake and then you slow down what 
you're doing and observe yourself for 

346
00:21:35,171 --> 00:21:37,570
the motor errors and then you correct 
them,

347
00:21:37,571 --> 00:21:38,404
which is difficult.
And then you practice and practice and 

348
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:40,534
practice and practice and practice and 
you automate the new routine and then 

349
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:44,314
you go on and so what consciousness is 
doing is watching output and when 

350
00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:51,340
there's a mismatch between what you're 
aiming at and what happens,

351
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,680
you stop.
That's basically anxiety.

352
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,090
You make your error correction and that 
fixes the hierarchy and then you go on,

353
00:21:58,091 --> 00:22:01,360
well that's really the relationship of 
the individual to society as well.

354
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,793
Now you push that idea a fair bit 
further and I might as well tell you 

355
00:22:07,211 --> 00:22:09,130
about this.
We never discussed this in our,

356
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,680
in our section on Yom,
but it's pretty interesting.

357
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,130
See if I can get this right.

358
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,230
Okay.
So young basically presumed,

359
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,073
presumed that as you were socialized,
you developed that persona and the 

360
00:22:28,761 --> 00:22:33,080
persona was you in so far as you're 
socialized,

361
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,870
now you can see persona,
persona.

362
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:40,790
When you listen to someone who's very,
very concerned with their appearance and

363
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:41,624
whose,
whose speech is somewhat false as a 

364
00:22:43,641 --> 00:22:45,500
consequence,
you know,

365
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,680
so they don't seem genuine.
They seem to polished,

366
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:49,940
let's say,
or something like that.

367
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,410
You know,
there's not a lot of emotion,

368
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,910
for example,
in their speech,

369
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,930
they're very self contained and 
concerned with their public appearance,

370
00:22:56,931 --> 00:23:01,240
which it seems also to be a very 
desirable consequences.

371
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:05,610
Spending too much time in social media 
because it's all persona development,

372
00:23:05,611 --> 00:23:06,860
tate's.
It's not.

373
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:07,923
It's not necessarily a good thing.
It does seem to be associated with 

374
00:23:10,071 --> 00:23:15,020
higher rates of depression anyways.
Your,

375
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:20,290
your persona is you as socialized,
being so young would say,

376
00:23:21,021 --> 00:23:25,070
yeah,
obviously you can be socialized and what

377
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:28,550
that means is some of you is invited out
to play and to develop,

378
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,720
but a lot of years left on 
differentiated or even forbidden.

379
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,100
So for example,

380
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,473
this happens with agreeable people.
Agreeable people think aggression is 

381
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:39,984
wrong.
Well that's not very useful because 

382
00:23:42,241 --> 00:23:43,074
first of all it's not wrong and second 
of all because they have the for 

383
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:48,980
aggression and so if that isn't brought 
out to play,

384
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:53,630
it sits at home and it's closet and gets
all war advanced and only comes out,

385
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:55,400
you know,
at night to cause trouble.

386
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,280
And so one of the things you would say 
as well,

387
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,640
this is part of the exploration of the 
shadow,

388
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:02,474
is there's going to be us persona and 
then there's this mishmash of 

389
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:08,180
undeveloped and resentful,
um,

390
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,853
potential roughly speaking,
and your job is to transmute your moral 

391
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:19,670
system and integrate all that stuff that
was rejected into your personality.

392
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,960
And that's often involves a descent into
the underworld and a rebirth.

393
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:28,640
And that's another mythological motif.
So his idea was

394
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,970
you can think about it this way.
So Piaget said

395
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,363
at the last step of moral development,
you view yourself as someone who could 

396
00:24:45,031 --> 00:24:47,970
alter the rules and young would say,
wait a minute,

397
00:24:47,971 --> 00:24:52,170
there's another point in that not only 
do you alter the rules,

398
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,183
you alter them so that you can include 
things that were denied or forbidden by 

399
00:24:57,691 --> 00:25:02,010
the previous system of rules.
And so it's a more inclusive game.

400
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:06,990
And part of what it includes is those 
parts of you that you'd cast off because

401
00:25:06,991 --> 00:25:07,824
they were socially inappropriate.
So and often you'll Freud's comment 

402
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:16,050
about that sort of thing was that was 
often sexuality and aggression,

403
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,650
partly because those are kind of 
individual in nature and they're kind of

404
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:23,370
harder to integrate into a social group 
and people will take offense to them.

405
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,233
I mean,
look what's happening on college 

406
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,124
campuses.
Universities are spending more time 

407
00:25:27,871 --> 00:25:29,610
worrying about sexual assault.

408
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,653
Then they are worrying about education 
and the reason for that is it's the 

409
00:25:34,471 --> 00:25:35,304
reason we're just describing is that 
sexuality and aggression are very hard 

410
00:25:38,761 --> 00:25:41,520
to integrate,
so they remain on outside.

411
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:44,460
Now you might say,
suppress it for Christ's sake.

412
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:45,294
You know,
gate your sexuality under control and 

413
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,203
eradicate your aggression.
That's a stupid idea because we know 

414
00:25:51,121 --> 00:25:53,430
what happens when you do that.
You know,

415
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,353
you turn into a little milk saw he sort 
of creature with a tremendous amount of 

416
00:25:58,471 --> 00:26:01,710
resentment and then you sporadically 
explode that hardly.

417
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:05,550
Plus you're denying yourself immense 
depth in your personality.

418
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:06,843
You know,
like a person who has repressed their 

419
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:09,474
aggression,
their sexuality generally is just dull 

420
00:26:11,551 --> 00:26:14,400
as you can possibly imagine.
You don't even want to talk to them.

421
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,500
Whereas someone who has that integrated 
there are far more interesting,

422
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,343
you know,
because there is a provocative element 

423
00:26:20,701 --> 00:26:23,310
and the teasing element and a dangerous 
element and,

424
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,373
and a colorful element and all of those 
things that make social interactions 

425
00:26:28,051 --> 00:26:28,980
much more interesting.

426
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,270
It's,
it's,

427
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,523
you know,
you're playing with fire at that point 

428
00:26:34,561 --> 00:26:37,590
in your personality development,
but human beings are born into play with

429
00:26:37,591 --> 00:26:40,530
fire,
so you don't want to deny yourself that.

430
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,633
So anyway,
so young's idea of continued moral 

431
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:45,054
development was know,
hold the oppressed self out of 

432
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:49,320
captivity,
so to speak.

433
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,410
Notice what you're doing,
you know,

434
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,090
partly to refuse to take responsibility,
but also partly just to tame yourself so

435
00:26:57,091 --> 00:27:01,470
that you're at least not annoying and 
get that other stuff up into the game.

436
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,070
So he would think of that at least in 
part as the union of the,

437
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:09,090
let's say,
the Union of the articulated itself with

438
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:09,924
the unarticulated itself,
a lot of which would be grounded in 

439
00:27:12,391 --> 00:27:15,660
emotion and motivation.
So okay,

440
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:16,763
so that's.
He thought of that as a conjunction 

441
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,493
conjunction number one.
So that's the bringing together of 

442
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:27,351
spirit and soul or or articulated self 
at the end,

443
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:29,940
articulate itself,
something like that.

444
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,840
So now you're an organized from the 
perspective of your psyche,

445
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,033
but then there's another staff and so 
now you think of that as an organized 

446
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,363
thing.
The next step is to integrate that with 

447
00:27:41,431 --> 00:27:42,264
your body and that basically means not 
only to have that integrated state of 

448
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:50,340
being as a,
as a,

449
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,480
as a belief system and and system of 
representation,

450
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:55,314
that perception,
but also to act it out in the world 

451
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,810
because it's one thing to know 
something,

452
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:03,510
it's another thing to do it,
but if you really know it,

453
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,700
there's no difference between knowing it
and doing it.

454
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,760
Okay?
So then your body and your,

455
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,660
your mind and your body are unified.
And then there's a third step after that

456
00:28:12,661 --> 00:28:13,494
which is really quite complex.
And this is where you start to shade 

457
00:28:16,771 --> 00:28:20,360
into phenomenological perspective.
So you know,

458
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,080
when we were talking about 
phenomenology,

459
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:25,530
one of the things I pointed out was that
the phenomenologists are,

460
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,473
they're playing a,
you could say they're playing a complex 

461
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:32,300
philosophical game and the game is what 
if that.

462
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,143
What if is okay,
forget about the idea of subjective and 

463
00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:37,920
objective.
Just forget about it for a moment.

464
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,783
Okay,
we'll start with a new set of 

465
00:28:39,721 --> 00:28:40,554
presuppositions.
The presuppositions are that everything 

466
00:28:43,831 --> 00:28:48,510
you experience is real and everything 
you experience is you.

467
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:53,040
So you say reality is experience,
but there's an implication to that.

468
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:58,041
And the implication is that in so far as
you're part of my experience,

469
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,483
the separation between us is illusory 
and so the next stage that young 

470
00:29:03,871 --> 00:29:04,704
proposed was that the integrated itself 
eliminates the distinction between self 

471
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:12,870
and other.
So that would be.

472
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,580
That would be recognition.
For example,

473
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:16,414
and everyone already knows this,
that it's pretty hard for me to be 

474
00:29:18,421 --> 00:29:22,910
stable and happy if I see you miserable 
and suffering well,

475
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,060
why is that?
Well,

476
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:26,850
it's because in so far as I encountered 
you,

477
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:30,840
at least your misery and suffering is my
misery and suffering.

478
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,460
You know,
unless I'm psychopathic.

479
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:33,294
To the nth degree,
and so the idea that and that has to be 

480
00:29:36,571 --> 00:29:37,404
taken care of.
Well and you certainly see this in the 

481
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:39,744
realm of the family.
You know if you're in a family and one 

482
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:42,694
of your family members is you know not 
doing well in a manner they can't help 

483
00:29:48,191 --> 00:29:49,024
or not doing well in a manner that can 
help the probability that that's going 

484
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:57,121
to have a direct bearing on your quality
of being is 100 percent.

485
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,890
In fact,
it might be the prime determinant and so

486
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:04,180
then you can seriously ask yourself what
makes you think you're separate?

487
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,450
And you know a phenomenologist would 
say,

488
00:30:08,451 --> 00:30:11,780
well that's your assumption that the 
subject object divide is absolute.

489
00:30:11,781 --> 00:30:13,190
That's what makes you think you're 
separate.

490
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,170
And so the final step,
it's kind of akin to a Dostoevsky idea.

491
00:30:18,171 --> 00:30:19,004
Dostoevsky positive in one of these 
weird sort of transcendent moments that 

492
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:28,040
everything that happened to you was not 
only your fault,

493
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:28,874
but everything that happened to everyone
was your fault and he didn't mean it 

494
00:30:32,451 --> 00:30:33,284
precisely like that.
He meant it more like everything that 

495
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:37,544
happens to you is your responsibility 
and everything that happens to everyone 

496
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:44,210
else is also your responsibility know,
and that's it.

497
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,733
Well,
it's an insane claim to some degree 

498
00:30:48,211 --> 00:30:53,211
because it broadens the realm of your 
responsibility out to unlimited reach,

499
00:30:53,281 --> 00:30:54,114
but,
but life isn't insane thing and so 

500
00:30:58,181 --> 00:31:00,640
there's no reason to assume that just 
because of that,

501
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,623
you know,
seems exaggerated to the point if your 

502
00:31:03,831 --> 00:31:04,664
rationality that it's wrong.
There's lots of things about life that 

503
00:31:07,751 --> 00:31:09,950
are exaggerated to the point of 
irrationality,

504
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,660
like the fundamental structure of life.
Israel is irrational.

505
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,060
You,
you're born arbitrarily.

506
00:31:16,061 --> 00:31:18,370
There you are in your particular time 
and place.

507
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,133
You live in accordance with your talents
and limitations and then at the end of 

508
00:31:22,721 --> 00:31:24,280
that,
there's no you anymore.

509
00:31:24,281 --> 00:31:25,120
It's like,
good,

510
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:25,954
good luck.
Make an act rational like it's 

511
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,710
intrinsically irrational.

512
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:32,763
You know,
in one of the things that really 

513
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:34,504
advanced theories of human development 
posit is that to answer in irrational 

514
00:31:38,711 --> 00:31:39,544
question,
you need an irrational answer and I 

515
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:44,770
think that's exactly right.
You know,

516
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,930
if,
if life is an impossible burden,

517
00:31:46,931 --> 00:31:47,764
which is clearly the case,
then you need an impossible goal to set 

518
00:31:52,421 --> 00:31:56,170
against it,
to justify it and part of that might be,

519
00:31:56,171 --> 00:31:57,004
well,
you know,

520
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:00,370
get your act together,
improve the quality of being around you,

521
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:02,630
but then that starts to,
you know,

522
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:06,010
stretch its tentacles out to include 
more and more people.

523
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,800
And so,
you know,

524
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,780
one of the things I've thought about for
a long time is

525
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,260
there's this proclivity of people to 
flee into,

526
00:32:16,261 --> 00:32:20,550
let's say nihilism for,
for every good reason under the books or

527
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:21,384
ideological possession and the 
alternative to those two things you 

528
00:32:24,811 --> 00:32:27,390
might think of as chaos.
So.

529
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,210
Well nihilism is sort of a form of chaos
anyways.

530
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,343
It's not surprising that people become 
nihilistic plus it's easy and it's not 

531
00:32:34,951 --> 00:32:37,440
surprising that they become 
ideologically possessed.

532
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,040
Plus it's easy.
The question is,

533
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,050
is there any reasonable alternative to 
that?

534
00:32:42,051 --> 00:32:42,340
You know,
when,

535
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,173
if you read people like Ernest Becker 
who wrote a book called the denial of 

536
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:46,574
death,
he was a hyper Friday and really his 

537
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:49,484
whole hypothesis like the terror 
management theorists who derive their 

538
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:52,994
ideas from becker by the way,
is that everything people do is 

539
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,380
illusory.
You know,

540
00:32:57,381 --> 00:32:59,150
no matter what it is,
it's an illusion.

541
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,853
And so the fundamental underlying 
reality of human life is that it's 

542
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:04,424
hopeless.

543
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,110
Well,
God,

544
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:08,180
you know,
that's a hell of a conclusion to draw.

545
00:33:08,181 --> 00:33:09,014
And I think it's,
I think it's clearly the wrong 

546
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,133
conclusion because it leads to,
it leads to places you just do not want 

547
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:16,934
to go.
And for me that's enough evidence that 

548
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:20,060
there's something wrong with it.
You know,

549
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:23,660
like if you're following a path and it 
leads to Auschwitz,

550
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,740
I would say,
hey,

551
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,830
there's something wrong with that path.
And you might say,

552
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:30,230
well the whole paths are equally absurd.
It's like,

553
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:31,790
yeah,
okay.

554
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,800
But some of them really hurt and you 
know,

555
00:33:33,801 --> 00:33:37,050
maybe we could do without those.
And I think it's a very different,

556
00:33:37,051 --> 00:33:39,730
it's very difficult to dispute that as 
far.

557
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,790
I mean,
you can,

558
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,020
but what you have to say then is all the
pain and suffering in the world.

559
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:46,040
It doesn't matter.
You know,

560
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:46,874
along with all the good stuff,
you can make that irrelevant right away 

561
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,150
just by doubt,
but you're really going to take the next

562
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:55,460
step and say,
you know,

563
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,473
all that human induced unnecessary pain 
and suffering is actually meaningless 

564
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,414
and irrelevant.

565
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,380
It's like,
I think,

566
00:34:03,381 --> 00:34:06,270
yeah,
put that person in jail now you know,

567
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,540
before they do something really 
dangerous,

568
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,650
while I don't really mean that,
but you get,

569
00:34:10,651 --> 00:34:14,450
you get the point is that you,
you draw a conclusion like that,

570
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:16,700
which is a logical conclusion of 
nihilism.

571
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,920
You draw a conclusion like that.
It's like all,

572
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:19,803
all bets are off for you.
So there's something that just seems to 

573
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:24,740
be wrong.
It just seems wrong.

574
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:25,574
That conclusion.
And so then one of the things you might 

575
00:34:28,731 --> 00:34:29,600
ask,
it's okay,

576
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,420
that doesn't seem very good.
What's the opposite of that?

577
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:35,420
So one of the things that I've really 
been trying to figure out is what is the

578
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,180
opposite of the path that leads to 
Auschwitz?

579
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,313
You know,
once we can agree that that's a bad 

580
00:34:40,401 --> 00:34:41,151
path.
Okay,

581
00:34:41,151 --> 00:34:41,984
fine.
We've got a bad identified that implies 

582
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,920
the reverse.
Good Path.

583
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,810
It doesn't define it though,
right?

584
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,703
It just implies it.
So the implication would be whatever is 

585
00:34:52,461 --> 00:34:56,180
least likely to lead you,
there is defacto good,

586
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:57,014
or at least you could.
You've basically identified the 

587
00:34:59,151 --> 00:34:59,984
territory and it seems to me that the 
opposite of not caring about anyone and 

588
00:35:05,631 --> 00:35:09,590
wishing perhaps for their painful 
destruction is something like caring for

589
00:35:09,591 --> 00:35:13,400
everyone and wishing for their universal
betterment,

590
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,593
something like that.
And that seems to me to be associated 

591
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,014
with the idea of improving being itself 
and that means yours and your families 

592
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:24,074
and your communities and far out as you 
can reach probably starting with the 

593
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,940
local,
you know,

594
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:29,803
until you get yourself all practice.
And so that seems to be to be an 

595
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:39,311
impossible aim in some sense and that's 
actually a good thing because the,

596
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,713
the psychological consequences of 
pursuing an impossibly good goal are 

597
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:48,924
that everything you do starts to become 
meaningful because it's related 

598
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,910
intelligibly to that goal.

599
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,240
And you have a structure within which 
you can grapple with uncertainty,

600
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,590
you know,
because if someone says,

601
00:36:01,591 --> 00:36:04,800
well even you says,
well why do you bother with that?

602
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,150
You can say,
well,

603
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,610
because of this and this and this and 
this and this and this,

604
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:09,444
and then it leads down to Auschwitz and 
so we're not going there and that's why 

605
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:14,310
I'm doing this.
And that's a,

606
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,150
that's a hell of a tough argument to 
argue yourself out of.

607
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:18,993
And you know,
one of the things you really need in 

608
00:36:19,831 --> 00:36:24,690
life is an argument for life that you 
cannot dispute,

609
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:26,663
you know,
because otherwise you're playing like 

610
00:36:27,541 --> 00:36:32,190
the existentialists would say with this 
constant recurrence of existential doubt

611
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:35,790
and that paralyzes us and cripples you 
and it makes you weak.

612
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,970
And so and worse,
you know,

613
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,170
it's,
it works.

614
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,213
You can end up with so much self 
contempt just because of who you are as 

615
00:36:45,151 --> 00:36:49,200
a creature that you're unconsciously 
wishing for.

616
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:50,760
You know,
absolute denial.

617
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,600
I see this in many,
many places,

618
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:59,580
but one of the things I've seen it most 
frequently probably in the last 30 years

619
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:00,414
is the insistence on the part of certain
certain parties who are at least in 

620
00:37:07,341 --> 00:37:09,860
principle,
concerned with environmental issues that

621
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:12,440
the planet would be better off with no 
people on it.

622
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,743
It's like I think,

623
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,530
well the first thing I think is,
well let's start with you,

624
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:23,150
but the next thing I think is really 
that's really what you think.

625
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,271
It's like,
you know,

626
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:25,104
if you,
you,

627
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,083
you don't have to go very far down from 
a psychoanalytic perspective into the 

628
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:30,384
dream underlying a statement like that 
before you see that it is a sort of 

629
00:37:34,441 --> 00:37:35,274
dream that you did not want to have 
anything at all to do with because 

630
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:39,834
there's an actively genocidal component 
to it and it's based in loading of 

631
00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:45,240
humanity,
self-loathing,

632
00:37:45,241 --> 00:37:47,430
but also low thing on the entire 
species.

633
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,264
It's like
better be aware of that sort of 

634
00:37:50,881 --> 00:37:52,920
thinking,
which is not to say that,

635
00:37:52,921 --> 00:37:53,754
you know,
we don't have some things that we could 

636
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:55,440
clean up,
you know,

637
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:59,400
but you know,
little sympathy for humanity wouldn't be

638
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:00,234
a bad thing.
We do have a relatively hard time of it 

639
00:38:02,401 --> 00:38:03,234
after all,
which is also something the 

640
00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:05,380
existentialists know.

641
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,590
They're nice corrective to freud because
Freud says,

642
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:09,510
hey,
you're probably healthy unless something

643
00:38:09,511 --> 00:38:11,480
terrible has happened to you,
you know,

644
00:38:11,481 --> 00:38:13,470
and the existentialists called alarm 
come along and say,

645
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:14,304
yeah,
but something terrible happens to 

646
00:38:15,301 --> 00:38:16,890
everyone.
So you know,

647
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:21,090
existence itself is sufficient cause for
human insanity.

648
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,330
And you know,
I basically by that I think everyone has

649
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:28,230
an impossible existential and moral 
burden.

650
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,680
It's a condition of life.
And so,

651
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,710
so when you see a creature like that,
you think,

652
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:35,544
yeah,
it's no wonder you're a bit cracked and 

653
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,920
you know,
maybe somewhat dangerous,

654
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:40,480
but it's like,
man,

655
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:42,370
you've got the motivation for it.
So,

656
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,880
you know,
little understanding might be an order,

657
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:49,420
you know,
when I see people who are agoraphobic,

658
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,430
hey,
come and say to me,

659
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,380
well,
I've become afraid of everything.

660
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:55,060
I think,
ah,

661
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,443
that's easy to understand.
I just can't figure out how the hell it 

662
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:00,880
was ever any different than that.

663
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,570
How did you ever manage to not be afraid
of everything?

664
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,660
Because that's the question.
You know,

665
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:09,910
and that's the fundamental existential 
question too.

666
00:39:09,911 --> 00:39:13,330
When you're surrounded by infinite 
vulnerability,

667
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,240
how the hell can you stay calm?
Well,

668
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:17,074
you know,
part,

669
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,033
there's a bunch of answers to that.
We've explored some of that partly is 

670
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,960
where you organize yourself with 
everybody else.

671
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:26,160
So the chaos is at least held at bay,
you know,

672
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,063
you're not confronted every single 
second with the possibility of insanity 

673
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:31,894
or disease or death.
You could put some distance between you 

674
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:37,210
and that.
And that's not an illusion.

675
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:39,950
It's like,
you know,

676
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:44,960
you don't want to spend the night in a 
hospital room where an epidemic of Ebola

677
00:39:44,961 --> 00:39:45,794
is raging and that's not a psychological
problem that you just don't want to be 

678
00:39:50,091 --> 00:39:54,410
there and intelligibly so,
so even putting any distance between you

679
00:39:54,411 --> 00:39:55,244
and that outcome isn't the losery,
but then then there's the other things 

680
00:39:59,001 --> 00:40:00,200
that we do too,
which are,

681
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:05,230
which is try to find meaningful things 
within the confines of our own lives and

682
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,463
the destructive and nihilistic 
philosophies basically always claimed 

683
00:40:12,101 --> 00:40:15,290
that that's delusional and I don't 
believe that.

684
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:16,124
I think that's wrong and I think it's 
dangerous and I think it's almost 

685
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,143
everything that students are taught in 
universities and so over the last 10 

686
00:40:24,351 --> 00:40:28,250
years it seemed to me to be in.
Maybe this is an overstatement,

687
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:29,084
but the university education in the 
humanities and often in the social 

688
00:40:31,851 --> 00:40:34,460
sciences causes more harm than it does 
good.

689
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:35,953
You know,
because this is basically what it 

690
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:37,934
teaches students at a point in their 
life where instead of confronting the 

691
00:40:41,631 --> 00:40:44,740
radical uncertainty underneath 
everything is that,

692
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,700
you know,
you should be invited into life.

693
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:52,690
Helped find a niche that's fulfilling 
from a human perspective,

694
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,713
master that and then you know,
maybe start thinking about extending 

695
00:40:56,691 --> 00:40:59,030
yourself a little bit beyond that,
into the unknown,

696
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,990
but to take people who hardly know what 
the hell they're doing to begin with and

697
00:41:02,991 --> 00:41:07,570
then expose them to
a postmodernist,

698
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:12,260
ultra rational,
fundamental critique of everything.

699
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,153
It's like,
what do you expect is going to happen 

700
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:17,000
when people have that experience?
Plus I think it's.

701
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:19,910
I think it's wrong.
That's the worst of it.

702
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,073
I don't think it's factually true.
I don't think it's philosophically true 

703
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:27,770
and I think it's dangerous.
That's a bad combination.

704
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,023
And you know,
part of the reason I think that people 

705
00:41:30,261 --> 00:41:35,261
do this and are such admirers of 
postmodern nihilism is that it abdicates

706
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:38,630
the necessity of responsibility.
You know,

707
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:39,590
because people say,
well,

708
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:40,424
I'm just thinking it through.
It's like you're never just thinking 

709
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:43,394
something through the probability that 
motivation has nothing to do with that 

710
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:47,714
is zero because we already know just 
from the things we covered in this 

711
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:54,230
class,
that motivation frames your perceptions.

712
00:41:54,231 --> 00:41:56,660
You know,
you can't even see the damn gorilla when

713
00:41:56,661 --> 00:41:58,730
you're counting the basketballs.
And so,

714
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,220
you know,
if you're formulating a rationalist,

715
00:42:02,221 --> 00:42:04,580
a critique of everything and then you 
say,

716
00:42:04,581 --> 00:42:05,960
Oh,
well I'm not motivated.

717
00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:09,500
It's like while you're motivated,
when you count the basketballs,

718
00:42:09,501 --> 00:42:10,334
and so the probability that you're 
motivated when you're doing something 

719
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,033
far more extensive and difficult,
and that is 100 percent no human would 

720
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:19,904
say
know this is when we get back to the 

721
00:42:23,511 --> 00:42:25,880
mythological underpinnings of things as 
well,

722
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:28,400
you know,
in the,

723
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,630
in the,
in the,

724
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:30,464
uh,

725
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,733
Egyptian

726
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,410
myth of creation and reality.
Oh,

727
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,413
cyrus is the figure of tradition.
So he sort of represents the dominance 

728
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,870
hierarchy roughly speaking in all of its
manifestations.

729
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,680
And he has an evil brother named seth.
Seth is a typical figure in fairytales.

730
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,573
You know,
in the lion king you see scar who's 

731
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:57,123
exactly the same figure and the scar 
sort of seth figure stands for the 

732
00:43:01,391 --> 00:43:05,430
proclivity of bureaucracies to 
degenerate into look malevolent,

733
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,960
totalitarian states,
which is always a problem,

734
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:08,794
right?
Because they,

735
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:09,863
a rigidity fly and then press,
that's the price you pay for existing 

736
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:18,600
within a hierarchy.
And then they rigidified Oh,

737
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:21,550
press sometimes because that's just what
happens as the age.

738
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,760
And sometimes because there's a a voice,
I'm recommending that as a motive being,

739
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:31,390
it's okay if you do this,
it's okay if you break this rule,

740
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:32,283
you know,
what the hell difference does it make 

741
00:43:34,031 --> 00:43:38,890
any ways you see some of that being 
played out right now with the revelation

742
00:43:38,891 --> 00:43:40,780
of all those Panama papers.
Right?

743
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:44,260
So,
which is a huge revelation of corruption

744
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,420
at hardly surprising at high levels of 
power all around the world.

745
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,280
Now I see the

746
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,173
no at the bottom of everything.
So this is the archetypal Dabs I see 

747
00:43:58,901 --> 00:44:03,901
this battle in the human soul,
basically between an attitude that says,

748
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:07,443
despite its limitations,
life is valuable and worth preserving 

749
00:44:11,201 --> 00:44:12,034
and improving as proposition one and 
proposition is the suffering that life 

750
00:44:17,081 --> 00:44:17,914
involves,
renders it ethically untenable and 

751
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:24,010
physiologically and psychologically 
unbearable.

752
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:27,040
And as a consequence of that,
it should just be eradicated.

753
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:29,800
And so it's a binary choice is some 
sense,

754
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,330
yes to be in or no,
and you know,

755
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:36,450
you can,
you can conjure up powerful arguments on

756
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:37,284
both sides of that.
But to some degree your whole being is 

757
00:44:40,861 --> 00:44:45,050
an argument between those two questions.
You know,

758
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,900
and one of the things that young said,
which I think is extremely worthwhile,

759
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,310
is that you should figure out what 
archetypal forces are in charge of your,

760
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,240
of your ba because they're there whether
you know it or not.

761
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,103
Now you know,
we've walked through that with some 

762
00:44:58,801 --> 00:44:59,634
detail.
You could look at it in a sense from a 

763
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:05,970
biological perspective,
it's more mechanistic.

764
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:06,804
You know,
when you're a tool of hunger and anger 

765
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,640
and fear and love and loss and all those
primordial forces that

766
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,473
that

767
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:19,293
make up your field of experience.
That's a purely biological way of 

768
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:25,770
thinking about it,
more architectural way of thinking about

769
00:45:25,771 --> 00:45:26,604
it.
Just that those things are actually 

770
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:32,160
characters or personalities and they're 
organized into hierarchies that are also

771
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:34,440
characters and personalities.
You know,

772
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:38,800
an anger and fear and resentment and 
hatred and carton.

773
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,240
You know,
the carnivorous soul of human beings and

774
00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:43,074
all of those things aggregate into one 
form of Metta personality and all the 

775
00:45:46,981 --> 00:45:51,981
things that you might think about as 
existing in opposition to that aggregate

776
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:54,100
into another.
And then the.

777
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:58,440
The top most struggled for integration 
is a struggle between those two things.

778
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,350
That's a very common mythological theme,
you know,

779
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:04,140
that's basically the battle between good
and evil in heaven

780
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,690
and that's an unbelievably old.
It's a.

781
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:12,640
it's a.
it's an old idea as human beings have no

782
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,920
the battle of the gods for dominance and
habit,

783
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:17,200
even if it's not strictly between good 
and evil.

784
00:46:17,201 --> 00:46:18,034
You know what?
Even if it hasn't been developed to the 

785
00:46:18,971 --> 00:46:19,804
point of that ultimate opposition,
it's still a battle at some level 

786
00:46:23,741 --> 00:46:27,280
between titanic forces for domination.
Well,

787
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:28,143
that's partly a description of your own 
psyche and partly a description of the 

788
00:46:33,521 --> 00:46:36,400
organization or lack thereof of 
societies across

789
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,230
time and.

790
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,173
Well,
and it seems to me that that one of the 

791
00:46:43,741 --> 00:46:46,890
things young was insistent upon because 
he was trying to,

792
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,660
and many of the fingers that we've 
covered in this,

793
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,120
in this series,
you know,

794
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:56,190
they were,
they were trying to answer the question.

795
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:57,024
This was especially true for the 
clinicians of how it is that an 

796
00:47:00,301 --> 00:47:05,301
individual should conduct themselves so 
that their mode of being is optimized.

797
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:06,900
You could say,
well that's mental health,

798
00:47:06,901 --> 00:47:07,734
but that's.
It's a radically insufficient way of 

799
00:47:10,291 --> 00:47:11,610
describing that because,

800
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:14,943
well,
it's not merely the absence of 

801
00:47:15,701 --> 00:47:17,770
pathology,
it's something much more complex.

802
00:47:17,771 --> 00:47:20,200
That's something active and it's not 
even individual.

803
00:47:20,201 --> 00:47:22,000
It's individual and social,
you know,

804
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:22,843
because you're not going to be mentally 
healthy unless you're integrated into a 

805
00:47:25,481 --> 00:47:26,314
functioning social community.
You just can't do it because other are 

806
00:47:29,351 --> 00:47:31,070
part of what keeps you sane,
you know,

807
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,460
because they're always whacking you.
When you get out of line a little bit,

808
00:47:33,461 --> 00:47:34,294
they just tap you with sarcasm or raised
eyebrows or frowns or smiles or they're 

809
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:42,790
constantly tapping you into being a 
proper person.

810
00:47:42,791 --> 00:47:44,170
Whatever the hell that is,
you know,

811
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,390
but they're telling you all the time 
what it is.

812
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:47,993
So

813
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,420
you know,
so niches.

814
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:56,263
Idea was that the modern world had 
landed itself in hot water because it's 

815
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:01,933
own proclivity for searching out.
The truth had undermined it's faith in 

816
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,580
traditional axioms of morality.
Fair enough.

817
00:48:10,581 --> 00:48:12,890
That seems about right.
You know,

818
00:48:12,891 --> 00:48:17,120
and his cure for that was that people 
became,

819
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,260
he called it over.
Men often translated as superman,

820
00:48:21,261 --> 00:48:22,094
which were people who created their own 
values to fill the void left by the 

821
00:48:26,691 --> 00:48:27,524
absence of traditional values,
but there's a bunch of problems with 

822
00:48:30,081 --> 00:48:30,914
that idea.
One is individuals probably can't do it 

823
00:48:33,681 --> 00:48:35,570
because they don't live long enough,
and second,

824
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,793
it's really hard.
I mean just from my perspective of what 

825
00:48:39,621 --> 00:48:40,454
are you going to be the best philosopher
who ever lived because that's really 

826
00:48:42,891 --> 00:48:43,724
what it requires and then the third 
problem is what makes you think you 

827
00:48:47,271 --> 00:48:48,104
create values?
Like it doesn't phenomenologically 

828
00:48:50,631 --> 00:48:51,980
obvious that you do.

829
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,370
It's more like you experienced them and 
sometimes you don't even know where they

830
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,710
came come from.
You get angry.

831
00:48:57,950 --> 00:48:58,783
Do you know why?
Maybe you'll have to think about it for 

832
00:49:00,921 --> 00:49:05,921
like three days.
So in what way you created that as well.

833
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:10,130
It's not self evident and young's idea 
was,

834
00:49:10,131 --> 00:49:10,964
well,
the forces that we had regarded as 

835
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:19,100
traditional sources of values,
we're actually spontaneous constructions

836
00:49:19,101 --> 00:49:23,180
of the human psyche.
They weren't arbitrary systems of rules.

837
00:49:23,181 --> 00:49:24,014
They were way deeper than that and I 
think if you have an ounce of biologist 

838
00:49:28,331 --> 00:49:30,680
in you,
you immediately read that and think,

839
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:31,810
well,
yeah,

840
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:34,820
obviously,
obviously you know,

841
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,940
even the social rules that govern a 
dominance hierarchy,

842
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,210
like they're instilled in you,
you know them,

843
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:42,044
they're right in your body,
and so there's a biological basis for 

844
00:49:44,631 --> 00:49:48,680
your understanding of culture right at 
that level that's damn near spinal,

845
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:52,360
like it's old.
So you,

846
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,910
secondary proposition was,
and this is quite an interesting one,

847
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:56,803
is that by attending to your fantasies 
and your dreams and your daydreams for 

848
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:01,874
that matter,
you can come into contact with some of 

849
00:50:04,461 --> 00:50:08,810
the primordial psychic forces that 
originally produced religious revelation

850
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:13,250
and so that you can find what's lost by 
looking within,

851
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,620
you know,
and that's basically the entire point of

852
00:50:15,621 --> 00:50:18,470
union psychotherapy.
And part of the reason I'm concentrating

853
00:50:18,471 --> 00:50:21,560
on young is because guys like Rogers,

854
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,590
you know,
and the phenomenologists they're,

855
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:27,503
they're,
they're moving down the same trail of 

856
00:50:29,211 --> 00:50:30,044
thought,
but they didn't get as far as young as 

857
00:50:31,251 --> 00:50:32,084
far as I could tell.
Like they never took it to its ultimate 

858
00:50:33,981 --> 00:50:35,330
conclusion.
You know,

859
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:36,164
like maslow for example,
talk about a hierarchy of needs and the 

860
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:40,923
self actualized person was someone who 
had accomplished all those basic needs 

861
00:50:45,351 --> 00:50:46,940
and popped out at the top.
It's like

862
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,350
kind of true,
but sort of primitive,

863
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:52,303
you know,
because it is by no means obvious that 

864
00:50:53,691 --> 00:50:54,524
you have to take care of all your basic 
material needs before you can act 

865
00:50:58,491 --> 00:51:00,590
morally.
It's a foolish idea.

866
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:01,843
It assumes that people are going to get,
like they're going to be become more 

867
00:51:05,151 --> 00:51:05,984
moral as they get richer now.
Like I'm not saying they become less 

868
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:10,244
moral because I don't believe that,
but I don't see that there's any 

869
00:51:11,931 --> 00:51:13,280
positive association.

870
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:14,143
It's just you can use it,
you can use your wealth well or you can 

871
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:20,840
use it badly just like you can use your 
poverty well or use it badly.

872
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,720
So.
So maslow,

873
00:51:23,721 --> 00:51:24,381
it's like,
yeah,

874
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:25,490
there's a hierarchy.
Yes,

875
00:51:25,491 --> 00:51:27,140
something emerges at the top.
No,

876
00:51:27,141 --> 00:51:29,330
it's not a consequence of the 
fulfillment of needs.

877
00:51:29,331 --> 00:51:32,920
It's way too materialistic.
It's basically like a utopian select,

878
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:35,030
a utopian socialist idea,
right?

879
00:51:35,031 --> 00:51:38,390
If you feed people enough cake,
all of a sudden everyone will get along.

880
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,130
It's like people aren't like that at 
all.

881
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:41,773
So you took this idea of personal 
development as far as I can tell to its 

882
00:51:46,011 --> 00:51:46,844
ultimate extreme to its logical 
conclusion and that's where he ran into 

883
00:51:49,551 --> 00:51:50,384
the archetypes because what archetypes 
are in some sense is the ultimate 

884
00:51:53,571 --> 00:51:57,080
instantiation of an idea.
You can't go beyond.

885
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:59,210
That's why it's an archetype,
you know?

886
00:51:59,211 --> 00:52:00,890
So there's an archetype of death.

887
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:02,750
Well why?
Well,

888
00:52:02,751 --> 00:52:03,584
because he can't go past that.
Like words fail when you're confronted 

889
00:52:06,951 --> 00:52:09,890
by that and there's an archetype of love
and you know,

890
00:52:09,891 --> 00:52:10,724
there's an archetype of evil and all of 
those things are there beyond 

891
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:18,650
articulation and in,
in their archetipal form.

892
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,633
And they are the place where you're 
articulated thought ceases to be 

893
00:52:23,601 --> 00:52:27,290
relevant.
So for young,

894
00:52:27,291 --> 00:52:29,720
you know,
the self development

895
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:36,050
route was the confrontation of those 
things that you had abandoned within.

896
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:38,203
Now I've been thinking about young for a
very long time and I think that one of 

897
00:52:43,221 --> 00:52:44,054
the things that struck me about the 
cycle analyst is that they're much too 

898
00:52:46,461 --> 00:52:47,294
concerned about the idea that if you're 
properly properly organized as a human 

899
00:52:52,911 --> 00:52:56,060
being,
that organization is interest psychic.

900
00:52:56,090 --> 00:53:00,260
Like it's in you somehow,
and which is,

901
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:01,070
uh,
you know,

902
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:01,903
so for young,
the hero's journey was a journey into 

903
00:53:03,531 --> 00:53:06,530
the unconscious and individual journey 
into the unconscious.

904
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,293
Now he,
he started to see flaws in that idea as 

905
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:11,954
he moved forward with this thinking.
But one of the flaws in that idea is 

906
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:19,610
that you're not only individually not at
all and if you're,

907
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:20,773
if you're situated properly,
we'll say in being your relationships 

908
00:53:26,251 --> 00:53:27,084
are healthy as well as the proper 
balance being struck inside you between 

909
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:34,890
the competing sub personalities that 
make you up.

910
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,810
And those things are actually not 
different.

911
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:39,510
And you know what I mean,
you can't have one without the other.

912
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:41,123
So to think about them even as separate 
spheres is improper in a sense because 

913
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:50,160
you're limited in your wellbeing by the 
wellbeing of those people who are,

914
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:52,650
you know,
in concentric circles around you.

915
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:57,240
And no matter how well organized you are
internally,

916
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:00,160
it's insufficient.
No,

917
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,033
you see that reflective in stories like 
the story of the Buddha because at one 

918
00:54:03,421 --> 00:54:08,421
point the Buddha after being walloped by
knowledge of old age sickness and death,

919
00:54:09,811 --> 00:54:10,644
because that's really what does it mean 
he attains enlightenment under a tree 

920
00:54:14,101 --> 00:54:15,210
for variety of reasons.

921
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,940
We won't go into,
you know,

922
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:17,783
so he's attain the perfect state of 
primarily subjective Ba and that's sort 

923
00:54:22,591 --> 00:54:24,480
of like,
it's a temptation.

924
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:25,343
There is a temptation to remain there,
but he shuts that down and then goes 

925
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:29,304
back into the world and teaches people 
because his realization is nirvana 

926
00:54:32,821 --> 00:54:35,520
attained individually is not true.
Nervana,

927
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,940
you can't be not suffering in a sea of 
suffering.

928
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:39,833
You know,
all that means is that you've got a 

929
00:54:40,531 --> 00:54:43,440
particular kind of blinder on and so you
know,

930
00:54:43,441 --> 00:54:45,750
he goes back so to speak and then 
suffers.

931
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:49,440
No,
mythologically speaking suffers a normal

932
00:54:49,441 --> 00:54:50,274
human death.
And in some sense that's portrayed as 

933
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:53,664
voluntary.

934
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,013
So

935
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:04,560
sometimes I show People Pinocchio in 
this class.

936
00:55:04,561 --> 00:55:07,020
I think we did a little bit of that.
Did we do a little bit of that?

937
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,180
Well,
you know,

938
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:10,103
in Pinocchio,
Pinocchio was trying to become a real 

939
00:55:13,531 --> 00:55:18,360
person and he have to do a variety of 
very strange things to manage that,

940
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:19,403
one of which is to go down into the 
depths of the ocean and confront the 

941
00:55:22,921 --> 00:55:27,921
most frightening thing roughly speaking 
and simultaneously rescue his father,

942
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,990
which is a very,
very strange set of ideas.

943
00:55:30,991 --> 00:55:31,824
You know?
It's definitely a descent into the 

944
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:33,954
underworld.
There's elements of Jonah and the whale 

945
00:55:35,311 --> 00:55:37,050
in there.
I was very,

946
00:55:37,051 --> 00:55:37,884
very old story,
but there's an idea that's very much 

947
00:55:40,831 --> 00:55:41,664
associated with union thinking too.
And that is that in the in the 

948
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:49,610
background chaos of your mind,
there are depths and in those depths are

949
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:56,370
what the forgotten or non articulate 
structures of your culture.

950
00:55:56,371 --> 00:56:00,930
But more than that,
the forgotten or non articulate parts of

951
00:56:00,931 --> 00:56:03,150
your psyche that would make it a 
cultural,

952
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,253
a culture creating entity.
And that that has to be discovered in 

953
00:56:08,731 --> 00:56:12,210
order for you to be.
To have the courage to be an individual.

954
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,960
And there's nothing delusional about 
that.

955
00:56:16,961 --> 00:56:20,470
You know,
because the idea there as opposed to say

956
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:21,543
the typical nihilistic or terror 
theories is that if you got your act 

957
00:56:25,811 --> 00:56:29,260
together,
the fear of death would no longer be the

958
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:31,630
thing that fundamentally rules you like 
that.

959
00:56:31,631 --> 00:56:32,464
That's actually possible.
So there's a weird idea there and the 

960
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:39,541
idea is not the fear of vulnerability in
death is irrelevant or not.

961
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:41,733
Not even that it's not central,
but that people are so God damn tough 

962
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:46,863
that it's possible that they can face 
that directly and say that's not going 

963
00:56:51,011 --> 00:56:54,220
to be what rules my life.
And I believe people can do that.

964
00:56:54,221 --> 00:56:56,650
I've seen people do that certainly in 
their careers.

965
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:57,823
You know,
even if they can't articulate that 

966
00:56:58,991 --> 00:56:59,824
philosophy,
you put them in a situation where 

967
00:57:01,271 --> 00:57:05,240
they're doing nothing but dealing with 
death and destruction and you know,

968
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,800
they can do it,
which is mind boggling and a great thing

969
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:09,730
to be able to see.

970
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:11,730
And it's,
you know,

971
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:16,000
you search in vain throughout the annals
of psychology for optimistic ideas.

972
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:17,373
And I think that's particularly true 
with regards to like the more 

973
00:57:19,961 --> 00:57:20,794
experimental brands of psychology that 
are associated with being like social 

974
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,544
psychology personality.
We'll leave out of this for the time 

975
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:29,380
being because it's become more 
statistical,

976
00:57:29,381 --> 00:57:30,214
you know,
but the idea that there's enough in you 

977
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,253
so that if you don't flinch from life,
you can become strong enough to master 

978
00:57:39,371 --> 00:57:41,680
it.
That's an amazing idea.

979
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:44,770
It's the only optimistic idea I've ever 
seen that's profound,

980
00:57:44,771 --> 00:57:45,604
that I absolutely believe has most of 
the profound ideas that are easy to 

981
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:51,190
believe are terrible ideas,
you know,

982
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:52,203
they have to do with the inevitability 
of malevolence and death and insanity 

983
00:57:55,661 --> 00:57:57,490
and suffering and all of that.
You know,

984
00:57:57,491 --> 00:57:59,770
those things kind of blow through your 
persona.

985
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,190
But trying to find something optimistic 
to counterbalance that.

986
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:05,740
That's tough.
But you know,

987
00:58:05,741 --> 00:58:10,120
the other thing we know about people now
that we didn't know a few years ago

988
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:19,230
is that
if you put yourself in new environments,

989
00:58:20,351 --> 00:58:22,360
you actually change yourself 
genetically.

990
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,253
You know.
So if I take you out of your safe 

991
00:58:26,291 --> 00:58:27,970
environment,
start to expose,

992
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:30,610
you,
say to situations that you fear.

993
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:32,163
You could say that one of the reasons 
that you transform is because you 

994
00:58:34,691 --> 00:58:37,810
observe yourself mastering those 
situations,

995
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,420
you know,
so you get bigger,

996
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:42,730
so to speak in the situations,
get smaller,

997
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,590
lovely.
You can,

998
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:47,650
you can,
you can account for that by learning,

999
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:51,760
but there's an additional dimension that
might be related to the learning,

1000
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:55,000
which is that if you put yourself into a
new situation,

1001
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:59,690
then different proteins start to be 
encoded in your brain and you know,

1002
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:02,590
and the rest of your nervous system,
so you actually transmute,

1003
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:03,453
literally speaking,
and the total range of human 

1004
00:59:05,561 --> 00:59:10,561
transmutation is unexplored.
So there's this idea.

1005
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:14,440
Let me show you.
This is a cool thing to know about.

1006
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,593
Um,

1007
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:43,550
okay.
So that's a picture of a labyrinth at,

1008
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,413
in the shark feed federal.
Now a cathedral is shaped like a cross 

1009
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:51,403
and then the focal point of the 
cathedrals right at the middle of the 

1010
00:59:55,821 --> 00:59:58,460
Cross and the cross is an x,
so to speak,

1011
00:59:58,461 --> 01:00:03,461
in the center of the x is where you are.
And the reason it's a cross between this

1012
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:06,500
because of the center of that x is 
suffering.

1013
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,730
And so the central aspect of 
consciousness,

1014
01:00:10,731 --> 01:00:13,370
of being his integrity associated with 
suffering,

1015
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,840
betrayal,
all of those things,

1016
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:17,030
that's the nature of the center of the 
world.

1017
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,280
And so then the question might be,
well,

1018
01:00:19,281 --> 01:00:20,900
how do you cope with that?
Well,

1019
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:25,910
the typical religious ideas that you 
identify with a hero figure of some sort

1020
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,313
and although that's often warped and 
morphed into the idea that you believe 

1021
01:00:30,991 --> 01:00:32,540
in them,
that's not what.

1022
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,100
It's not the right idea.

1023
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,530
The right idea is that you identify 
with.

1024
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:40,250
So I can give you an example from that 
in the Christian mass ceremony,

1025
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,450
which is actually a cannibalistic ritual
and it's a very,

1026
01:00:44,451 --> 01:00:47,480
very old idea,
and the idea is that you become what you

1027
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:49,320
ingest,
right?

1028
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:52,790
And so it's the mass ceremony which is 
in principle,

1029
01:00:52,791 --> 01:00:53,624
the eating of the flesh of a god is not 
a ritual to instantiate articulated 

1030
01:00:59,901 --> 01:01:00,734
belief.
It's a ritual to instantiate embodied 

1031
01:01:03,501 --> 01:01:04,334
transformation.
You're supposed to become what that 

1032
01:01:05,991 --> 01:01:06,824
represents.
Question is what the hell does it 

1033
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:10,100
represent?
What we know?

1034
01:01:10,101 --> 01:01:11,870
Some of that it represents,
for example,

1035
01:01:11,871 --> 01:01:12,704
the ability to pay attention.
That's one thing that for sure it 

1036
01:01:15,051 --> 01:01:19,100
represents because Christ is an analog 
of of Horus,

1037
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:21,740
a very tight analog horse as a matter of
fact.

1038
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,470
So,
but what else does it represent?

1039
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,830
Oh,
I can give you some other suggestions.

1040
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:28,663
One of the things that is often required
of the believer in a traditional 

1041
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:34,784
religion is a pilgrimage right now that 
was quite common in Christianity in the 

1042
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:40,340
Middle Ages.
That's kind of disappeared.

1043
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:41,443
You see bits and pieces of it in Judaism
with the idea of modern Judaism in 

1044
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:45,434
particular,
with the idea that every North American 

1045
01:01:47,451 --> 01:01:48,290
Jew,
for example,

1046
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:53,291
she'd go to Israel at least once and 
then of course it's a massively featured

1047
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:56,030
element of tradition,
traditional Islam.

1048
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,021
So you think,
well,

1049
01:01:57,021 --> 01:01:59,600
what does a pilgrimage dude is someone?
Well,

1050
01:01:59,601 --> 01:02:02,490
partly it's a journey to the holy city.
Whatever that means.

1051
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:03,363
The holy city is a symbolic 
representation of an ideal mode of 

1052
01:02:06,331 --> 01:02:07,790
being.
So you're.

1053
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,510
You're making a symbolic journey to an 
ideal mode of being.

1054
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:12,351
Okay,
well,

1055
01:02:12,351 --> 01:02:13,184
let's say you're some ratty villager 
from somewhere and you've never been 

1056
01:02:15,501 --> 01:02:18,650
more than a mile away from your,
from your village,

1057
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:19,920
and you're functionally illiterate.

1058
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:22,410
You don't know anything about the world 
in one day you decided to,

1059
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:25,920
you know,
take up $1,500 or 3000 mile pilgrimage.

1060
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:27,293
The probability that you're going to be 
the same person when you come back as 

1061
01:02:30,271 --> 01:02:34,020
you were when you left is zero,
and the reason for that is,

1062
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:34,883
well,
a lot of things are gonna happen to you 

1063
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:36,384
along the way.
God only knows it's gonna be a big 

1064
01:02:37,951 --> 01:02:39,750
adventure and you might say,
well,

1065
01:02:39,751 --> 01:02:42,780
what's the utility?
And that utility is that,

1066
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:44,243
you know,
with each stressful situation you 

1067
01:02:46,051 --> 01:02:51,051
encounter and master your,
your capacity grows,

1068
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:55,890
and so maybe you'll encounter 500 of 
those on your pilgrimage.

1069
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:56,940
Maybe you don't even,
you know,

1070
01:02:56,941 --> 01:02:57,774
maybe it's dangerous enough so there's a
reasonable probability that you won't 

1071
01:03:01,171 --> 01:03:03,930
even come back alive.
But if you do come back,

1072
01:03:03,931 --> 01:03:06,570
you're not naive.
You've seen the world.

1073
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:09,960
You're going to be someone who's much 
more difficult to contend with.

1074
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:11,323
You know when you're going to be a bit 
of a forerunner to the people in your 

1075
01:03:13,051 --> 01:03:16,080
village price,
you pay for that member in the hobbit.

1076
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:21,540
When billable goes out to confront the 
dragon,

1077
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,120
then he comes back,
no one really likes them anymore,

1078
01:03:24,121 --> 01:03:25,950
like they respect them,
but they think,

1079
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,431
well,
you know,

1080
01:03:26,431 --> 01:03:30,570
here's this weird guy that transformed 
himself into like a thief and you know,

1081
01:03:30,571 --> 01:03:33,750
then when confronted a drag and he went 
way the hell away from his home,

1082
01:03:33,751 --> 01:03:36,990
so he started contaminated by the 
foreigner and he made it back.

1083
01:03:36,991 --> 01:03:37,824
You don't want to mess with him,
but he's not the same thing that he was 

1084
01:03:41,731 --> 01:03:44,040
when he was there,
you know?

1085
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:44,874
And that's all to the good.
I mean what happens in the next series 

1086
01:03:46,951 --> 01:03:47,784
of books that makes it quite evident 
that if Bilbo hadn't undergone his 

1087
01:03:51,241 --> 01:03:52,074
adventure,
than the battle between good and evil 

1088
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,340
would have gone to the evil side.

1089
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:57,253
Right?
That's the entire plot of the Lord of 

1090
01:03:58,981 --> 01:04:02,280
the rings.
It's this massive fantasy of good versus

1091
01:04:02,281 --> 01:04:03,114
evil,
just like Harry Potter and those things 

1092
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:09,340
like those ideas never go away.
You see that with the avengers too.

1093
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:10,800
You know,
in the,

1094
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:12,360
in the,
in the,

1095
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:15,210
the one of the scenes in there is 
extremely interesting.

1096
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,480
You know,
so there's this scene,

1097
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:19,403
this is where the,
what do they call those foreign alien 

1098
01:04:21,211 --> 01:04:23,190
things,
Qatari or something like that,

1099
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:25,043
you know,
the big monsters that come through the 

1100
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:29,340
portal and then invade New York.
I don't remember what they're called,

1101
01:04:29,341 --> 01:04:32,850
but there's a very interesting scene in 
there where the,

1102
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:34,533
uh,
armed forced to send a hydrogen bomb to 

1103
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:40,710
take New York out because of the descent
of these terrible aliens,

1104
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:41,544
right?
And iron man who's this weird android 

1105
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:45,683
things.
So he's a human being that's 

1106
01:04:46,321 --> 01:04:49,440
transforming himself into something 
that's more than a human being.

1107
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,753
One of the things that happens with iron
man suit gets increasingly gold as the 

1108
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:57,030
series continues.
There's a real reason for that.

1109
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:01,500
He makes a personal sacrifice to avert 
the hydrogen bomb,

1110
01:05:01,501 --> 01:05:02,334
right?
And then it blows up all the bad guys 

1111
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:06,450
and he falls to Earth just like ICARUS.
So that's pretty cool.

1112
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:07,763
And then what's really interesting is 
that when he falls to earth and he's 

1113
01:05:11,551 --> 01:05:14,730
dead,
it's the whole or wakes them up.

1114
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,433
And the reason for that is that like the
hulk represents masculine energy that's 

1115
01:05:19,721 --> 01:05:21,710
completely unbound,
you know?

1116
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,593
And then Tony Stark is this sort of 
tightly constrained intellect character 

1117
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:29,140
who's half machine,
he's not enough savage,

1118
01:05:29,141 --> 01:05:32,020
that's one way of looking at it.
And so when he's lying there half dead,

1119
01:05:32,021 --> 01:05:32,854
he's missing something.
And so the whole comes along and like 

1120
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:35,443
yelled at them into being again and he's
already made a relationship with the 

1121
01:05:38,261 --> 01:05:39,094
hulk.
Right?

1122
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:40,383
And these things are genuine myths 
because they're cocreated with their 

1123
01:05:44,681 --> 01:05:45,540
audience.
You know,

1124
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:46,413
all of these stories has a backstory.
And if you're a comic book writer and 

1125
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:52,120
you deviate improperly from the 
backstory,

1126
01:05:52,121 --> 01:05:54,400
then you're going to get like 10,000 
letters from fans.

1127
01:05:54,401 --> 01:05:54,971
Say,
well,

1128
01:05:54,971 --> 01:05:58,360
what about issue 118 on page 13?
You know,

1129
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,400
that's part of the necessary plot.

1130
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:01,733
Well

1131
01:06:08,810 --> 01:06:12,330
alright,
keep Tony Stark in mind for a minute.

1132
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:13,733
Now you see this labyrinth here.
So I'll tell you what you do in the 

1133
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:18,180
Shark Cathedral.
So you've got this cross.

1134
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:20,220
And then this thing is at the point of 
it.

1135
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,950
Now,
if you go on a pilgrimage,

1136
01:06:23,070 --> 01:06:23,903
you go out there and expand your 
personality by visiting the north part 

1137
01:06:26,791 --> 01:06:29,370
of the world in the west part of the 
world of the east part of the world,

1138
01:06:29,371 --> 01:06:30,204
in the south part of the world.
You go everywhere you are a wanderer 

1139
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:34,680
that's gone everywhere.
Okay,

1140
01:06:34,681 --> 01:06:37,680
but maybe you can go to the damn 
pilgrimage for one reason or another,

1141
01:06:37,681 --> 01:06:38,514
so you do a symbolic pilgrimage.
She'd go to the cathedral and you go to 

1142
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:43,410
the point of suffering,
so to speak,

1143
01:06:43,411 --> 01:06:47,190
and then you enter this maze and to get 
to the middle of the maze,

1144
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:51,090
which is very much like the Buddha,
the flower of the that the Buddhist sits

1145
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:53,580
in because it's a flower to get to the 
middle,

1146
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:55,620
you can't just walk straight to the 
middle.

1147
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:56,903
You have to wonder the entire maze and 
cover every square foot of it and only 

1148
01:07:02,851 --> 01:07:05,700
once you've done that,
so that's a symbolic journey to north,

1149
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:06,541
east,
west,

1150
01:07:06,541 --> 01:07:08,730
and south.
Only after you've done that,

1151
01:07:08,731 --> 01:07:09,564
do you get to the middle and the middle 
signifies the point where the suffering 

1152
01:07:13,351 --> 01:07:16,350
that's represented by the entire 
structure of that building.

1153
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:17,513
Can Be with stood and you know,
you got to understand this idea is so 

1154
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:24,173
you think about what those damn 
Europeans were doing when they were 

1155
01:07:26,341 --> 01:07:28,830
building those cathedrals.
You know,

1156
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:31,590
some of those things took 500 years to 
build.

1157
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:32,933
You can't even imagine a modern society 
building something that would take 500 

1158
01:07:36,601 --> 01:07:37,890
years to build,
you know,

1159
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:40,530
it's,
it's unimaginable to us.

1160
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:43,800
So,
and these cathedrals were so expensive.

1161
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:47,460
They were like the moon,
the trip to the moon in the 19 sixties,

1162
01:07:47,461 --> 01:07:48,294
you know,
the whole damn culture was devoted to 

1163
01:07:50,371 --> 01:07:51,204
producing these fantastic structures of 
stone in light that had this particular 

1164
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:57,240
message embodied in it.

1165
01:07:57,390 --> 01:07:59,130
It's like,
why were they doing that?

1166
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:00,031
Well,
you know,

1167
01:08:00,031 --> 01:08:00,864
you can get cynical about it,
although I think that'd be a little 

1168
01:08:03,151 --> 01:08:06,400
premature,
but this is part of the answer.

1169
01:08:06,401 --> 01:08:07,234
It's like the culture was trying to 
figure something out and what they were 

1170
01:08:10,621 --> 01:08:14,850
trying to figure out is where you should
be and how you should get there.

1171
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:16,130
And,
and,

1172
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:16,963
and to point out as well how massive the
consequences were of failure versus 

1173
01:08:21,201 --> 01:08:22,034
success.
Because failure that leads to hell and 

1174
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,333
success that leads to heaven and you 
know you can think about that as 

1175
01:08:27,501 --> 01:08:31,760
something projected into the,
into the future life which nature called

1176
01:08:31,761 --> 01:08:33,830
the biggest error Christianity ever 
made.

1177
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,670
But if you dispense with that,
at least provisionally,

1178
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,460
you know the reality of that becomes 
clear right away.

1179
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:41,563
What happens if you don't take the 
voyage while you become corrupt as your 

1180
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:48,170
week?
It's as simple as that.

1181
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:51,200
And as soon as you and you have every 
reason to become corrupt,

1182
01:08:51,201 --> 01:08:52,034
like you can say,
the conditions of existence are such 

1183
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:57,620
that if you cannot tolerate them,
you will become corrupt.

1184
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:00,890
And I just,

1185
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:07,090
I just can't see in any way how that's 
not self evidently true.

1186
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:09,763
And so if you don't take the voyage,
well what happens is everything tilts 

1187
01:09:13,071 --> 01:09:13,904
towards hell around you,
but you have a lot more influenced than 

1188
01:09:16,881 --> 01:09:17,714
you think.
So you don't know exactly what waves of 

1189
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:22,890
causality or emanating from your 
decision.

1190
01:09:22,891 --> 01:09:25,070
So you have no idea,
you know?

1191
01:09:25,071 --> 01:09:25,904
And then if you do just start to go 
everywhere and to pick up your 

1192
01:09:29,091 --> 01:09:32,980
responsibility,
then what emanates out from Jojo.

1193
01:09:32,981 --> 01:09:33,814
And no,
maybe in receiving waves is the idea 

1194
01:09:35,931 --> 01:09:39,230
that it's possible to live life properly
and to make things better.

1195
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:41,443
And

1196
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:42,913
that's an idea.
Like I think that idea is more powerful 

1197
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:46,394
than death

1198
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:50,860
and it would be really good if that was 
the case.

1199
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:51,953
You know,
they existential element comes in and I 

1200
01:09:53,301 --> 01:09:54,134
guess this is also the element of faith 
is the only way you're going to ever 

1201
01:09:56,151 --> 01:09:59,990
figure that out is if you try it because
no one else can demonstrate,

1202
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:00,853
you know,
the truth or falsity of those two 

1203
01:10:02,601 --> 01:10:07,601
branching pathways except you because 
you have to test it in the conditions of

1204
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:09,470
your own life.
You know.

1205
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:12,590
And at some point by the time you hit 
about 30,

1206
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,160
nobody can tell you what to do and you 
think,

1207
01:10:16,161 --> 01:10:16,994
well hooray.
It's like let's go a little easy on the 

1208
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:20,240
celebrating.
You know,

1209
01:10:20,241 --> 01:10:21,074
it's quite a relief when you have a 
problem and you can go to someone and 

1210
01:10:23,271 --> 01:10:25,040
they say,
well here's what you can do about it.

1211
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:30,460
But by the time you're fully adult,
your damn life is so individualized that

1212
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:35,660
you know you can use moral guidelines 
and you should for sure,

1213
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:40,190
but you're basically stuck with the 
choices.

1214
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:44,850
All these old ideas.
They suggest that

1215
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:51,540
if your choice is to voluntarily 
confront and to improve and to repair,

1216
01:10:51,990 --> 01:10:54,960
that not only do you repair the things 
around you,

1217
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:55,823
they don't have to be within you.
They can be anywhere around you and you 

1218
01:10:58,830 --> 01:11:02,940
continually healed the structure of 
being well.

1219
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:07,890
That'd be a good thing to try.
You know it's a big deal.

1220
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:12,600
It'll keep you busy in all.
It'll provide you're suffering with some

1221
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:13,434
meaning.
That's a big deal and the alternative 

1222
01:11:17,131 --> 01:11:18,300
looks dreadful.

1223
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:24,270
Well,
you know,

1224
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:26,460
I walked you through all these various 
theories,

1225
01:11:26,461 --> 01:11:27,294
some of them about behavior and some of 
them about personality and some of them 

1226
01:11:30,941 --> 01:11:33,700
have both philosophy and some of them 
about clinical psychology.

1227
01:11:33,701 --> 01:11:34,534
You know,
when it's an attempt to to allow you to 

1228
01:11:38,001 --> 01:11:41,690
take multiple snapshots of what a,
what a human being is,

1229
01:11:41,691 --> 01:11:45,230
and you know how we might manifest 
ourselves.

1230
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:46,873
For me,
knowing all those things has been 

1231
01:11:47,691 --> 01:11:50,630
ridiculously useful,
ridiculously useful.

1232
01:11:50,690 --> 01:11:53,210
Far More practical than anything else I 
ever learned,

1233
01:11:54,330 --> 01:11:55,163
you know,
and one of the advantages to knowing 

1234
01:11:57,201 --> 01:11:59,160
about personality is that,
you know,

1235
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:02,810
instead of reducing the individual to 
some set of measurable phenomenon,

1236
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:03,793
which I'm all for by the way,
it also expands your conception of what 

1237
01:12:07,551 --> 01:12:11,510
the individual can be to an almost 
unlimited degree,

1238
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:14,900
you know,
so instead of something like,

1239
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:15,763
instead of a human being,
some being something that has to waiver 

1240
01:12:18,261 --> 01:12:20,780
and be crushed under the weight of its 
own being,

1241
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,033
you know,
a human being could easily be something 

1242
01:12:23,031 --> 01:12:24,500
that could stand up and say,
yeah,

1243
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:29,460
well I can handle that and I think 
people can do that.

1244
01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:32,850
People are so damn tough.
It's unbelievable.

1245
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:34,183
You know,
I've seen people go through things that 

1246
01:12:35,221 --> 01:12:36,054
are just grinding terrible and
not only come out the other side but 

1247
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:42,774
actually put themselves together enough 
to clearly be a forest that rescues the 

1248
01:12:47,771 --> 01:12:49,730
culture and tries to improve the 
structure.

1249
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,040
And so like Ray,
for us,

1250
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:56,550
if we could do that,
not more than justifies whatever,

1251
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:58,673
you know,
horror horrors might be laid at our 

1252
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:02,700
collect at our collective feet.

1253
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:08,870
So I would say don't underestimate 
yourself,

1254
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:10,783
you know,
and you guys all have a lot going for 

1255
01:13:13,101 --> 01:13:13,850
you.
You know,

1256
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:16,220
you're smart,
you're young,

1257
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:21,730
you're reasonably conscientious,
and number of viewers are creative.

1258
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,073
You have access,
tremendous access to technological 

1259
01:13:26,421 --> 01:13:28,490
power,
you know,

1260
01:13:28,491 --> 01:13:29,324
so God only knows what you met might 
manage to hammer yourself into over the 

1261
01:13:32,301 --> 01:13:33,134
next 30 years or so.
But the more people that try to make 

1262
01:13:36,891 --> 01:13:39,470
things better consciously rather than 
worse,

1263
01:13:39,471 --> 01:13:41,450
the better off everything is going to 
be.

1264
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:45,410
That would be a hell of a fine thing to 
aim for.

1265
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:47,583
So

1266
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:50,390
that's mostly what I've learned from 
studying personality.

1267
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:53,103
So

1268
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,540
thank you very much for attending the 
course.

1269
01:13:55,541 --> 01:13:56,374
And a

1270
01:13:57,310 --> 01:13:58,143
good luck.
