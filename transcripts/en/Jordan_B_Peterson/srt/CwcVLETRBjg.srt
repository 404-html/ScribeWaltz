1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,760
You,
it's supposed to be nice.

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,510
So my name is Tammy Jordan and I known 
each other

3
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:23,140
for nearly 50 years.
Nearly 50 years.

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,653
Oh,
that's better.

5
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,410
We come from northern Alberta.
He lived up the street from me.

6
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:32,320
I always knew he would be a fascinating 
person.

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:33,933
So in my late twenties he moved east.
I was in Montreal and I thought it's 

8
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:41,614
probably time to marry them because if I
don't marry him I won't know what 

9
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:48,640
happens
and now we're seeing what's happening.

10
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:50,643
Yeah,
I mean he's been talking about these 

11
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:52,924
things.
He's been talking about what's going on 

12
00:00:53,981 --> 00:00:58,981
in our society and how it's moving left 
and how things are destabilizing for the

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,330
last 20 years.
And so when in September he said he came

14
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:09,760
down one morning and he was quite 
disturbed and he said,

15
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:14,200
you know,
I've got a couple of emails that I can't

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,220
deal with.

17
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,450
I can't deal with quietly and I'm going 
to have to say something.

18
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:20,770
What do you think can.
I said,

19
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:21,604
well,
you've been speaking to me and my son 

20
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:27,550
who was there to for for a very long 
time,

21
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:29,920
and maybe it is time for you to tell 
everyone

22
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,740
what's going on.
And so he didn't know.

23
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:36,400
He didn't know what would happen,
you know,

24
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:37,234
we didn't have any idea,
he just went up and made a video except 

25
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:44,670
what he's said and what he's always 
thought and what he sees coming down the

26
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:46,054
pipes.
And it resonated with tremendous 

27
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,950
response and mostly almost 95 percent or
more positive response.

28
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,650
So although it was destabilizing and I 
found beginning though,

29
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,700
it's,
it's,

30
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,610
it's a good thing.
And we've worked a lot with myself.

31
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:07,444
I wasn't as learned that,
but I sure liked a lot and I know you 

32
00:02:10,691 --> 00:02:14,320
guys have to and you're going to learn a
whole bunch of more today.

33
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,530
So welcome.
Thank you.

34
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,850
So who's your filming this?
Can I walk around?

35
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,430
Can you hear me without the microphone
then I will be able to walk around.

36
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,970
So I want to tell you a story.
It's not,

37
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,980
not be as good if you're

38
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,080
not on the mic is going to be broadcast.

39
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,420
So.
Okay,

40
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,363
so
I started studying the things that I 

41
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,253
have been talking about in.
Well really as long back as I can 

42
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:25,910
remember.
I think that's true.

43
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,470
I wrote an essay when I was about 13 on 
the,

44
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,390
on Auschwitz.
It wasn't very good essay but I was only

45
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:36,224
13 so it's not that surprising but,
and I don't know exactly why it was a 

46
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:42,204
particular concern to me except that of 
course it's the sort of thing that 

47
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:46,100
should be of concern to everyone.

48
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,320
How about if I speak a little louder?
Alright,

49
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,260
alright,
now I'll,

50
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,780
I'll do it.
I'll do it this way.

51
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,390
I think if you have any trouble at the 
back,

52
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:04,310
let me know what I'll,
I'll make sure that I'm,

53
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,150
I'm projecting.
So I said when I was about 13,

54
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:12,020
I wrote an essay on,
on our sweats and I,

55
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,190
I was trying to understand it.
Um,

56
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,033
I think maybe I tried to understand it 
in a way that was somewhat different 

57
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,233
than most people who examined historical
events because I was trying to 

58
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:30,041
understand how human beings could do 
that knowing full well that I was one of

59
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:33,374
them.
Then that's the critical thing because 

60
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,663
generally when people examine especially
something horrifying that's done by 

61
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,430
humanity,
they make the assumption that it's other

62
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:47,264
people doing it and that's a big mistake
in my estimation because if a lot of 

63
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:57,860
human beings have done something 
terrible,

64
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,383
you can be sure that
being a human being that you're capable 

65
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:04,934
of it
and you know one of the things that 

66
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,224
we've been asked repeatedly to do as a 
consequence of what happened in World 

67
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,233
War Two is to not forget it,
but it's always been my contention that 

68
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:25,250
you can't remember something you don't 
understand

69
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,173
and you don't understand what happened 
in Nazi Germany or in the Soviet Union 

70
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,864
for that matter.

71
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,990
Until you understand that had you been 
there,

72
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,543
the probability that you would have 
played a role and that wouldn't have 

73
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:42,500
been a positive one,
is extraordinarily high.

74
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,680
When people do think about themselves as
actors in situations like that,

75
00:05:47,721 --> 00:05:51,320
they have a proclivity to cast 
themselves in their heroic role.

76
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:52,154
Assuming that had they been say in Nazi 
Germany in the 19 thirties that they 

77
00:05:56,841 --> 00:06:01,841
would taken on the burden of
fighting against the Nazis and defending

78
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,630
the things that should have been 
defended,

79
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,210
but that's a very foolish 
presupposition.

80
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,583
Especially because it's more or less 
self evident from the historical 

81
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:17,150
perspective that that isn't what people 
did and in order for us to come to terms

82
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:22,151
with that it means that we have to 
understand how it happened,

83
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:27,890
but more importantly what role we still 
play as individuals in

84
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,080
acting in such a way that such things 
are not only likely but desired.

85
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,243
When I was older and in university,
I was plagued by nightmares mostly 

86
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:53,390
about.
They were apocalyptic nightmares,

87
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,253
mostly about the Third World War and I 
had very large long series of dreams 

88
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,283
about,

89
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,190
about nuclear bombs.
I remember one of them,

90
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,840
I was living in Edmonton at the time and
on the

91
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,563
on the south side,
and I can remember watching out through 

92
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:18,274
my window in the dream and seeing 
mushroom cloud form over the main core 

93
00:07:22,091 --> 00:07:22,924
of the city.
And then the dream shifted locales and 

94
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,780
there were a bunch of people in the 
wreckage and they started to fight and I

95
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:32,614
thought that's just exactly right.
And that was exactly what my nightmares 

96
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:37,714
were like,
is that no matter how tremendous the 

97
00:07:39,881 --> 00:07:40,714
catastrophe,
we don't seem able to derive the proper 

98
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,860
conclusions from it and start to act in 
a way that makes such things less rather

99
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,130
than more likely.

100
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,890
When I was in graduate school at Mcgill,
which would have been after that,

101
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,060
I was studying political science before 
that,

102
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:02,530
sorry,
back when I was in Edmonton.

103
00:08:02,531 --> 00:08:05,230
And before that I had even thought about
going into,

104
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:09,160
into law.
But as I studied political science,

105
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,503
I got increasingly disenchanted with the
explanations that were being offered to 

106
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:17,530
me about motivations for,
for human conflict,

107
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,240
um,
that especially in the upper years of my

108
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,613
undergraduate education,
that the lower years were pretty good 

109
00:08:25,601 --> 00:08:28,600
because mostly what I studied was 
political philosophy and literature.

110
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:31,270
And I found that very helpful.
But in the upper gears,

111
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,310
the contention of the professors was 
that people primarily

112
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,870
engaged in conflict for economic 
reasons.

113
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,733
That never struck me as a very deep,
deep explanation because it didn't get 

114
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:45,790
up the core of the issue,
which was,

115
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,020
well,
okay,

116
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:50,590
people fight about things of material 
value,

117
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:52,300
but why do they value those things?

118
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,133
I mean,
it's kind of self evident if you think 

119
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:57,510
about food and shelter and so forth,
but generally speaking,

120
00:08:57,511 --> 00:08:58,344
especially in the 20th century,
it wasn't necessarily about the basics 

121
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:04,230
of food and shelter that people were 
engaging in conflict about.

122
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:05,064
It was.
It was something much more subtle than 

123
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:06,954
that.
Maybe it had more to do with national 

124
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:09,690
identity,
with identity,

125
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,140
that kind of thing.
And so there was a psychological element

126
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:16,650
missing in the analysis of the human 
propensity for conflict.

127
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,933
That to me bloomed larger and larger and
so I decided at least in part for that 

128
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:23,904
reason to pursue a graduate degree in 
psychology and in clinical psychology 

129
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,750
and I went to mcgill and that's when I 
started to read very much more broadly I

130
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:35,670
suppose,
and I spent a lot of time reading.

131
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,653
I read a lot of Freud and a lot of all 
the classic clinical psychologists who 

132
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:44,700
were extraordinarily useful.
Carl Rogers and Sigmund Freud,

133
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,313
Alfred Adler and a whole host of them,
all the classic thinkers I could get my 

134
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:56,031
hands on and also most particularly the 
philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche,

135
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,953
most of whose major works I read at that
point and Theodore Dostoevsky who was 

136
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:05,490
writing very similar things to it very.
In fact,

137
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:07,230
Nisha was quite influenced by 
Dostoevsky.

138
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,700
Dostoevsky was a like a master in the 
literary genre,

139
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,620
has five great books

140
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,213
focused on the most difficult questions 
that face humanity both socially and 

141
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:21,134
individually.
I found those books overwhelmingly 

142
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:27,610
powerful and also extraordinarily useful
beyond good or a credit punishment,

143
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,160
for example,
is a brilliant,

144
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,713
brilliant piece of work outlining the 
motivation of someone who regards 

145
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:36,824
himself as above all law and who decides
that to not kill when necessary is an 

146
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:43,874
act of cowardice and so Dostoevsky walks
through his rationalization and and the 

147
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:53,420
murder and the aftermath of it in a way 
that's extraordinarily

148
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,723
enlightening and painful simultaneously 
and at the same time niche and Germany 

149
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:05,721
was writing philosophical tracts on 
exactly the same themes there.

150
00:11:05,961 --> 00:11:08,970
Their lives ran in in unbelievably close
parallel.

151
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,080
In fact,
when Nisha finally went insane,

152
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,410
he had some illness that has been very 
difficult to diagnose.

153
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,113
He had.
He'd seen someone beating a horse in a 

154
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:25,260
street and embraced it out of compassion
and there's a scene exactly like that in

155
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:29,490
one of Dostoyevsky's stories,
so it's the parallels are really uncanny

156
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,473
and I also read a lot of neuroscience 
because I did my thesis on the 

157
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:40,260
biological predisposition to alcoholism 
and that required a lot of investigation

158
00:11:40,261 --> 00:11:41,094
into more hardcore science investigation
into the structure and function of the 

159
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:45,294
brain and I tried to weave all of that 
together in a book that I published in 

160
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:51,000
1999.
It took me about 15 years to write.

161
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,300
I was writing three hours a day every 
day and thinking about it all the time,

162
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,330
like I was absolutely 100 percent 
obsessed by

163
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,710
by the sorts of issues that I'm 
discussing with you today.

164
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,270
It took me deep.
I read the Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,

165
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,190
much of what he wrote at the same time.
And then of course I,

166
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,243
I,
I,

167
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,070
I studied Carl young in great depth.
When,

168
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,983
when I finally started to crack,
what he was talking about was 

169
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,654
extraordinarily difficult material.
I read volume nine of his collected 

170
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:24,274
works,
which is called archetypes of the 

171
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:27,700
collective unconscious.
At first time I read it,

172
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:28,534
I didn't understand a word he was saying
and I think that's very common 

173
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,370
experience for people reading young 
who's certainly persona non grata in the

174
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,210
modern ECAP academy.
And I think the reason for that is that

175
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,780
while I think when you first encountered
union attended,

176
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:47,614
bounce off of,
and then the next thing that happens is 

177
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:53,350
you get very frightened and then you 
just leave it the hell alone.

178
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,810
And it's no wonder as far as I'm 
concerned,

179
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:58,490
because I don't think I've ever read 
anyone including me.

180
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,640
Chip that was more terrifying than 
young.

181
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,150
Um,
neat.

182
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,230
Young was a student of nature.
I don't,

183
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:08,260
I don't mean technically speaking,
although Nisha was everywhere.

184
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,750
Niches thinking was everywhere.
When human was maturing.

185
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,770
People know Carl young primarily as a,
as a disciple,

186
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:15,604
let's say a Freud,
which is true in part because Freud of 

187
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:20,730
course did the initial,
you might call,

188
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,070
might describe it as initial excavating 
work.

189
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,083
Outlining the fact that there was more 
going on in the human psyche then that 

190
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:29,164
met the conscious I and his greatest 
work likely was the interpretation of 

191
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:33,784
dreams where he started to perform an 
archeology of the of the symbolic 

192
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:45,091
unconscious.
I'm showing that much of our mental life

193
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,230
went on in some sense underneath our 
conscious awareness,

194
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:52,880
which is of course regarded as a truism 
now by psychologists,

195
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,130
but was quite revolutionary at the time.
It wasn't Freud's.

196
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,190
It wasn't entirely an original idea with
Freud.

197
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,293
Few things are entirely original ideas,
but he went farther than anyone else 

198
00:14:06,251 --> 00:14:07,084
synthesizing it and also publicizing and
promoting it and also basing a 

199
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:13,630
psychotherapeutic theory on it.
Really remarkable set of accomplishments

200
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:14,464
and young was very much influenced by 
Freud but also by niche and the reason 

201
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:19,774
he was influenced by nature most 
particularly was that niches 

202
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:25,414
announcement of the death of God.
In the late 19 hundreds was was a very 

203
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,940
striking philosophical event and and 
I'll,

204
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,823
I'll return to this,
but Nicha believed that because God was 

205
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:37,780
dead,
so to speak,

206
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,450
and the value structure upon which 
Western civilization was constructed,

207
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,493
had God at its foundation that that will
all crumble and that people would have 

208
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:49,564
to become their own daddy,
is in a sense they would have to 

209
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:57,551
discover or create furniture to create 
their own values and before nature could

210
00:14:58,761 --> 00:15:00,170
outline how that might happen.

211
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:05,260
He suffered the unfortunate descent into
madness and then died,

212
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,613
and so we left this major,
major problem behind which is if it's 

213
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:10,364
the case that the
ideational foundation of Western 

214
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:21,440
civilization
was predicated on an illusion,

215
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,330
on an illusion.
What?

216
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,350
What,
what?

217
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:28,040
What would we do next?
And he just said,

218
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:28,874
well,
that what we will certainly do next is 

219
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:36,761
descend into an unholy combination of 
nihilism and totalitarianism.

220
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,910
Because those will be the things that 
will back in most clearly in the chaotic

221
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:44,174
aftermath of the disillusion of the 
value structure upon which our society 

222
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:48,494
has been predicated and nature in his 
book will to power prophesied very 

223
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:54,284
directly that millions of people would 
die in the 20th century specifically 

224
00:15:58,581 --> 00:16:03,581
because of Communist revolutions and 
that was 40 years roughly speaking 30 to

225
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:07,280
40 years before the communist revolution
in the Soviet Union.

226
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:12,670
So that's an act of prophetic vision 
that's absolutely incomprehensible to.

227
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,000
I mean in the West.
We didn't know that the Soviet Union was

228
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:17,834
going to fall until the day it fell and 
niche and knew what was going to happen 

229
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:24,890
in the 20th century in like night in 
like 1880.

230
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,143
It's absolutely remarkable.
Young was very interested in the 

231
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:31,940
Nietzschean problem.
More interested in it than anything else

232
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,343
because he knew that the question of 
where we would derive our values from 

233
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:37,934
and how we would ground them in some 
sort of underlying solid underwrite 

234
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,593
lying reality would become was the 
paramount psychological question of the 

235
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,543
of the age.
And he spent his entire life his entire 

236
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,424
life attempting to address that.
You Young's idea was that we weren't 

237
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,553
going to be able to create our own 
values because human beings cannot 

238
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,990
create their own values and you know 
that if,

239
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:03,650
if,
if you observe your own action,

240
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,770
if you observe your own being,
you can make resolutions.

241
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,430
You can try to act in a particular way,
maybe a way that you regard as better,

242
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,473
but you'll find out very rapidly that 
you can't enslave yourself and tell 

243
00:17:14,841 --> 00:17:15,674
yourself what to do so easily.
Even when you're motivated to do good 

244
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:18,854
things.
You know when you make your New Year's 

245
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,510
resolutions and say that you're going to
eat properly and go to the gym.

246
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:27,850
That generally lasts about a week and so
you can't boss yourself around.

247
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,693
As it turns out,
no more than you can really boss other 

248
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:32,540
people around.
And it's because you do have a nature.

249
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,020
You have a nature and you can't just 
arbitrarily,

250
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,070
um,
mold and shape that nature because you,

251
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:42,980
like other people will rebel against 
your own will.

252
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:46,910
And so and so young.
His contention was that we would have to

253
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:49,740
go inside ourselves,
that that's how he looked at it,

254
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:50,574
into the symbolic background of our 
psychological structure and rediscover 

255
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:58,260
what we had lost,
and so

256
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,823
I found that's the ancient mythological 
motif of voyaging to the depths and 

257
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,970
rescuing your father from the belly of 
the beast,

258
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:13,971
and you see that idea
reflected often in popular culture.

259
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,220
A very well developed example of that is
in the Movie Pinocchio,

260
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,860
which I'm sure how many of you have seen
that movie.

261
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,751
Yeah,
right.

262
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:29,130
Well,
that speaks for itself,

263
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:29,661
right?
I mean,

264
00:18:29,661 --> 00:18:31,240
there's a why.
Why?

265
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,133
Why are you watching a puppet,
an animated puppet rescue his father 

266
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:39,150
from the belly of a whale?
It makes absolutely no sense,

267
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:40,560
but you don't care when you're watching 
it.

268
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,423
You think this is quite interesting and 
the reason it's interesting is because 

269
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:46,890
it speaks to you at a level that you 
understand,

270
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:49,380
but that you do not understand how you 
understand,

271
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,670
and of course any good work of art does 
exactly that to you.

272
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:58,870
It speaks to you about things that you 
almost know but don't yet know,

273
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,110
and that's what makes it profound.

274
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,143
And you knew that it would be necessary 
for modern people to journey to the 

275
00:19:07,471 --> 00:19:11,160
chaotic depths and rescue they're dead 
father from the underworld,

276
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,023
which is a very interesting symbolic 
realization in the aftermath of 

277
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:19,230
Nietzsche statement that God had died.
And so that's what you did.

278
00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:20,910
That's what he spent his entire life 
doing.

279
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:24,940
And he detailed that out in a very long 
series of very difficult and,

280
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,710
and very unsettling books,
um,

281
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,050
which people tend not to read and,
and,

282
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,820
and no wonder,
no wonder.

283
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,163
And so I read everything I could get my 
hands on that young had published at 

284
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:37,554
that point and a lot of work by various 
historians of religion and like Murcia 

285
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:42,990
Eliana,
who's,

286
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,560
who's out of favor because the 
postmodernists don't like him.

287
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,933
And uh,

288
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,363
and I put this altogether in this book 
that I published in 1999 called maps of 

289
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:55,920
meaning.
And it's also a very difficult book.

290
00:19:55,921 --> 00:20:00,510
And that was some somewhat purposeful 
and somewhat inevitable.

291
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:04,260
It was,
it was purposeful because I knew that if

292
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:09,150
I was going to discuss such things and I
didn't make it ridiculously rigorous,

293
00:20:09,151 --> 00:20:11,430
at least to the degree that I was 
capable of doing that,

294
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,700
that it would be easily dismissed and
that seems counterproductive,

295
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,503
but,
but it was also because I was trying to 

296
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:22,620
figure out rather than trying to write a
book,

297
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:23,454
I was trying to figure something out and
I was doing that by writing because 

298
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:26,964
writing is a very good way of figuring 
things out and I was trying to make it 

299
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,480
as clear as I could,
but that wasn't all that clear.

300
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:38,210
It's about 500 pages long.
I think this book and it's and I,

301
00:20:38,211 --> 00:20:41,520
I think I rewrote every sentence in it 
at least 50 times,

302
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,960
probably too many times because by the 
end it got.

303
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,800
I think I over edited it.
I think it was,

304
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,840
it,
it's in some sense too tight to it.

305
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:51,923
It's like it's like an overworked piece 
of art that that might be one way of 

306
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:54,970
thinking about it,
but.

307
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,213
And then it,
it's taken me decades of speaking about 

308
00:20:57,761 --> 00:21:01,930
it to continue to.
What would you call it?

309
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,913
Purify and refine it so that I can 
discuss it without having to go through 

310
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:07,893
dozens of hours of explanation and to 
condense it down into something that's 

311
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:12,214
more easily comprehensible.
So that's what I'm going to try to do 

312
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,773
this afternoon.
I want to tell you why I think we're in 

313
00:21:19,631 --> 00:21:22,840
the position that we're in,
what that position is,

314
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:23,674
and also potentially what can be done 
about it and those seams because also I 

315
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:32,050
believed and still do believe that if 
you actually understand the problem,

316
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,640
you can solve it,
but but you have.

317
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,910
That's actually an indication of your 
understanding.

318
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,930
Right?
If you,

319
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,910
if you,
if you haven't solved it,

320
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:40,744
you actually don't understand that 
there's things about it that you still 

321
00:21:42,371 --> 00:21:43,204
don't grasp.
And so when I was writing maps of 

322
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:46,084
meaning,
I wasn't so much trying to only figure 

323
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:49,024
out why it was that people were capable 
of the terribly barbaric things that 

324
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:52,714
they so happily did at Auschwitz,
but also to figure out what could be 

325
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:57,640
done,
if anything,

326
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:58,983
to stop that from happening.
Because it was also by no means self 

327
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:05,110
evident that anything in fact could be 
done about it because that might just be

328
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:05,944
an expression of that central human 
nature that I was talking about earlier 

329
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:11,320
and the fundamentally irreparable.
There's.

330
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,183
There's been no shortage of writers 
who've proposed that human beings are 

331
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:16,923
fundamentally flawed in a way that 
cannot be rectified and that are and we 

332
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:23,860
have a catastrophic destiny waiting for 
us.

333
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,873
As a consequence.
I mean in some sense that's built right 

334
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:27,574
into the fabric of Christianity itself 
because of course at least certain 

335
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:31,144
variants of it,
and I'm speaking about Christianity 

336
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:33,514
because in many ways it's at the 
foundation of Western Society because 

337
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,563
certain elements of Christianity at 
least regard people as irretrievably or 

338
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:42,304
irreparably tainted with original sin 
which emerged right at the birth of our 

339
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:48,244
species.
And there's something extraordinarily 

340
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:52,930
powerful about that idea because of 
course everybody in this room knows that

341
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:53,764
they're seriously flawed and also knows 
that they do things that make those 

342
00:22:57,161 --> 00:22:57,994
flaws more rather than less likely.
And everyone has that sense about 

343
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:01,924
themselves.
Unless they're narcissistic beyond 

344
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:07,900
belief.
In which case they also suspected.

345
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:08,763
But only at an unconscious level,
so we do carry this sense of ourselves 

346
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:15,140
as deeply flawed and imperfect and,
and,

347
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:19,270
and maybe fatally so and that seems to 
be built right into us.

348
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:23,650
And so maybe there is no solution,
but that seemed like a dismal hypothesis

349
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:24,484
to begin with.
So I wanted to do as in I wanted to 

350
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,313
investigate as deeply as I possibly 
could to see if I could conjure up 

351
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:35,290
something that vaguely rick represented 
the solution

352
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,350
for a long time.
You know,

353
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:45,590
there were months when I was writing
where really felt quite mad

354
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,223
and what the one of the most intense 
periods of time where that occurred was 

355
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:53,594
when I think I was kind of on the cusp 
of figuring out what I needed to figure 

356
00:23:57,711 --> 00:23:59,300
out.
I'd figured out two things.

357
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,780
One was that I kind of understood 
finally,

358
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:05,390
white people had belief systems and it 
wasn't

359
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:08,403
the belief system was there because we 
have to deal with an infinitely complex 

360
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:12,914
world and we have to simplify it down to
proportions that we can manage because 

361
00:24:15,591 --> 00:24:16,424
we don't have infinite cognitive or 
emotional or physiological resources 

362
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:23,510
were very bounded creatures living in an
unbounded environment.

363
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,493
Roughly speaking,
it's too much for us and so we have to 

364
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:30,820
impose structures of simplification on 
the world or or we we,

365
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:35,090
we get so stressed we die that that's 
roughly the bottom line.

366
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,423
For example,
if you develop posttraumatic stress 

367
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:39,344
disorder which occurs when you encounter
something in your life that you cannot 

368
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:43,790
compute,
so to speak,

369
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,670
your body goes into emergency 
preparation mode,

370
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,913
which which makes it hyper,
hyper responsive to threat and ready to 

371
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:52,604
do anything which is emergency 
preparation and that's so 

372
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,423
physiologically demanding that it 
demolishes your health is not merely 

373
00:24:58,551 --> 00:24:59,300
psychological.

374
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,860
It damages your brain.
I mean it,

375
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,640
it.
You just can't stay in high gear running

376
00:25:04,641 --> 00:25:09,641
flat out continually u dot and so people
need to simplify the world.

377
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:14,240
They need to live within structures of 
simplification because that's how they.

378
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,110
That's how they protect themselves from 
the terrible onslaught of complexity,

379
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,530
but by the same token,
we organize ourselves into these,

380
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,430
these structures of simplification.
That's what our cultures are.

381
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,580
We negotiate them,
we inhabit them jointly,

382
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,013
and because of that,
when we run into people who do that 

383
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:32,474
differently,
the probability that we'll engage in 

384
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:34,994
conflict is extraordinarily high because
I can't give up my beliefs just because 

385
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:41,270
you have different beliefs and if we 
don't have the same beliefs,

386
00:25:41,271 --> 00:25:43,580
then we can't peacefully occupied the 
same territory,

387
00:25:43,581 --> 00:25:46,970
so there's seems to be nothing for that 
except conflict.

388
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,820
If we can't negotiate,
then we have to fight.

389
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,430
So then I thought,
well that's,

390
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,930
that's,
that's that.

391
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:55,040
Then on the one hand,

392
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:02,190
the cat and our belief systems because 
they structure our realities and protect

393
00:26:02,801 --> 00:26:03,634
us,
but

394
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,100
and we can't fight because now we're so 
technologically powerful that if we do,

395
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:09,600
we're going to destroy everything.
It's like,

396
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:10,420
well,
that's that.

397
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,460
There's option one and its opposite.
That completely exhausts the options.

398
00:26:14,461 --> 00:26:15,294
And so that was a horrible realization.
Absolutely dreadful realization because 

399
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:20,064
you know,
it's certainly possible if you think 

400
00:26:20,971 --> 00:26:24,410
about this from a biological or an 
evolutionary viewpoint,

401
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,253
is that we're kind of a peculiar species
and we've developed these terrible 

402
00:26:28,141 --> 00:26:28,974
technologies of war and there's 
absolutely no reason to assume that we 

403
00:26:31,351 --> 00:26:33,600
won't just use them to wipe ourselves 
out and you know,

404
00:26:33,601 --> 00:26:34,434
maybe 30 percent of us as individuals 
and in our own psyches would be happy 

405
00:26:38,761 --> 00:26:39,594
about that because life is pretty 
dreadful and it's full of suffering and 

406
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:43,134
there's lots of that are harsh about 
existence and so maybe we should just 

407
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:50,340
let the whole thing go and believe me,
people are plenty motivated to do that.

408
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:54,810
If you haven't observed that motivation 
in yourself at some point in your life,

409
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:59,040
either you're not paying attention or 
don't want to pay attention or something

410
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:01,710
sufficiently dreadful has not yet 
happened to you,

411
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,930
but it will.
It will,

412
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:09,270
you know,
because everyone encounters catastrophic

413
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:10,104
crisis in their life and it drops the 
bottom out of them and makes them 

414
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,570
desperate and angry.
And,

415
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,180
and that's also part of the human 
condition.

416
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:23,530
Luckily after about three months of 
thinking about that,

417
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,420
I had a series of dreams that helped me 
sort out a third alternative,

418
00:27:28,421 --> 00:27:30,520
and that was of course,
at least in part

419
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,360
emerged as a consequence of all the 
things that I was reading,

420
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,413
so
I want recert return to the Nietzschean 

421
00:27:42,131 --> 00:27:44,410
conundrum,
so

422
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,800
Nisha was an extraordinarily astute 
critic of the Judeo Christian tradition.

423
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,713
He's.

424
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,720
He wrote a book called the antichrist in
fact,

425
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,243
and he also said that he philosophizes 
with a hammer and what he meant by that 

426
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:09,470
was that he was taking the hardest,
heaviest object he could and smashing up

427
00:28:09,471 --> 00:28:10,304
everything he possibly could with as 
much intellectual rigor as he could 

428
00:28:13,071 --> 00:28:15,740
manage,
and that was plenty because he was truly

429
00:28:15,741 --> 00:28:17,720
a genius,
but he was.

430
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,710
He wasn't a nihilistic person.
Quite the contrary,

431
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,120
had a very good reputation among those 
who knew him,

432
00:28:23,121 --> 00:28:24,710
for example,
is a very kind man,

433
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,220
but he was in part looking for something
that he couldn't destroy.

434
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,293
All right,
because that's partly how you find out 

435
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:33,470
what's real you.
You hit things so to speak.

436
00:28:33,471 --> 00:28:35,450
You push against the.
Your children do that to you.

437
00:28:35,451 --> 00:28:36,284
For example,
they push against you to see where you 

438
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:39,820
won't yield and then they think,
ah,

439
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,930
there's reality there.
There's a wall there.

440
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,823
I can't go beyond that,
and that's what Nisha was searching for 

441
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,110
and he was doing it all out.
Fundamentally,

442
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:54,040
how his contention was that what had 
happened in the West was that there that

443
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,303
the Judeo Christian tradition and even 
the precursors of that tradition upon 

444
00:28:58,571 --> 00:28:59,404
which from which that tradition he 
merged had insisted for millennia that 

445
00:29:04,761 --> 00:29:05,594
the pursuit of truth was the highest 
moral value and that one of the 

446
00:29:07,971 --> 00:29:09,800
consequences of that was that

447
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,323
the west developed science,
which was part of that pursuit of the 

448
00:29:15,491 --> 00:29:16,324
truth and then and then the tools of 
science once successfully grasped and 

449
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:27,310
universalized were then turned against 
the dogmatic structure of the church.

450
00:29:27,311 --> 00:29:30,520
When everyone woke up as scientists,
so to speak and thought,

451
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,363
well,
we're living by a set of superstitions 

452
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:40,850
and and they're not true
and we have to with them.

453
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,050
And so that was copernicus,
Darwin,

454
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:44,884
and that was Freud,
and that was these repeated blows that 

455
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,220
that are symbolic culture took at the 
hands of something that had fostered and

456
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:52,180
created and

457
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,483
Nisha said something as well.
At the same time when you remarked on 

458
00:30:08,491 --> 00:30:11,100
this,
on this consequences,

459
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,860
he said,
one of the most terrible things about

460
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,253
discovering
that assist them you believed in no 

461
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:24,861
longer functions is no longer sufficient
or can be undermined,

462
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:31,080
is that it raises the specter that all 
such systems have the same flaws.

463
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,623
You know sometimes you can jump from
atheism to Christianity and from 

464
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,710
Christianity to socialism,
say in success of leaps,

465
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:41,963
and then you're someone who's faithless 
from within the perspective of a given 

466
00:30:45,271 --> 00:30:46,104
system,
but you're faithful to the idea that 

467
00:30:47,641 --> 00:30:49,860
there are in fact systems that will 
work,

468
00:30:49,861 --> 00:30:54,000
but if your system fails enough,
then you can end up in a situation where

469
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,133
you don't even have any faith in the 
idea that systems as such can work and 

470
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:03,780
that makes you nihilistic.
And Nisha saw that as,

471
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,063
as,
as,

472
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,860
as the origin of the specter of 
nihilism,

473
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,600
hopelessness.

474
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,433
Fundamentally.
Now it's more complicated than that 

475
00:31:12,451 --> 00:31:14,970
because there are underground reasons,
so to speak,

476
00:31:14,971 --> 00:31:15,804
for being nihilistic,
that have nothing to do with the mirror 

477
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:22,020
collapse of irrational belief system,
and we'll talk about those too,

478
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,000
and he also talked about the,
the,

479
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,193
the,
the inevitable rise of totalitarianism 

480
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:36,060
as a medication for the loss of all 
meaning.

481
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,950
In some sense you might say,
well,

482
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,130
if you're in a chaotic state because you
no longer know what to believe,

483
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,263
it's very,
and someone offers you a set of 

484
00:31:44,431 --> 00:31:45,264
certainties to guide your life.
By then it's very attractive for you to 

485
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:54,060
reach out and grip onto those with all 
of your soul,

486
00:31:54,061 --> 00:31:57,870
so to speak,
because that stops you from merely being

487
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,750
adrift.
And then there's underground reasons for

488
00:32:00,751 --> 00:32:02,850
that too.
That all also returned to.

489
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:11,930
So the first question is,
was it necessary

490
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,333
for the sense of truth that needs you to
described as developed by the Judeo 

491
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,073
Christian tradition that then manifested
itself in the scientific methodology to 

492
00:32:24,241 --> 00:32:29,190
turn against the symbolic foundation of 
that structure and demolish it?

493
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:34,550
Was that inevitable and wasn't correct?
And that's the first question.

494
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,353
And so the answer to that was
the conflict between science and 

495
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:48,254
religion is a consequence of the 
immature state of both of those domains 

496
00:32:54,051 --> 00:32:54,884
of thinking.
It's not built into the structure per 

497
00:32:57,261 --> 00:32:58,094
se,
it's just that we aren't good enough at 

498
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:00,674
being religious or good enough about at 
being scientific in order to see how 

499
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,780
they might be reconciled.
Now that's a,

500
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,360
that's a hell of a claim

501
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,863
mean it's a frightening claim because,
and this speaks to some degree to the 

502
00:33:13,731 --> 00:33:15,860
underground reasons for being 
nihilistic.

503
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:16,694
So the terrible thing about being 
nihilistic is that nothing you do has 

504
00:33:19,521 --> 00:33:20,354
any meaning.

505
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:22,823
And,

506
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,683
and that's not so good because actually 
it's actually untrue because there are 

507
00:33:28,551 --> 00:33:32,180
forms of meaning in life that nihilism 
will protect you from or,

508
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,063
or even increase your exposure to.
And those are the tragic meanings of 

509
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:39,440
life.
I don't care how nihilistic you are,

510
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,513
what you don't believe in.
You're going to believe in your own 

511
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:43,544
pain.
You're going to believe in your own 

512
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:45,254
anxiety.
You're going to believe in the fact of 

513
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,210
pain and anxiety for everyone else.
You're going to believe in tragedy.

514
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,193
You can't think yourself out of the 
catastrophe of the world by being 

515
00:33:54,321 --> 00:33:57,830
nihilistic,
so the negative meanings remain.

516
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,920
You can dispense with the positive 
meetings,

517
00:34:00,921 --> 00:34:01,754
which seems to be a bad bargain,
but the upside of doing that is quite 

518
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,230
straightforward.
If I said to you,

519
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,570
here's your alternatives,

520
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,880
nothing you do matters or has any 
meaning.

521
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,673
Alternative one,
everything you do matters and has 

522
00:34:18,011 --> 00:34:20,590
meaning,
which one would you pick?

523
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:21,910
And you might think,
well,

524
00:34:21,911 --> 00:34:22,744
of course I would go for the second 
alternative because the first one is so 

525
00:34:25,451 --> 00:34:26,284
horrifying,
but the truth of the matter is the 

526
00:34:28,271 --> 00:34:29,104
second one is even more horrifying 
because it means that the things that 

527
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,154
you do for better or worse actually do 
matter and in some sense you're 

528
00:34:37,751 --> 00:34:38,584
responsible for them not only for the 
effect that they have on you in the 

529
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:42,124
immediate circumstances of your life,
but for the effect that they have 

530
00:34:44,651 --> 00:34:45,484
radiating out from you to others.
The other people that your network too 

531
00:34:49,211 --> 00:34:52,060
and also as they read,
as they,

532
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,013
as they make waves through time.
It couldn't be that everything you do 

533
00:34:56,051 --> 00:34:58,480
does matter.
That every choice that you make matters,

534
00:34:58,481 --> 00:34:59,314
and I do believe that that's the case,
that you're constantly making choices 

535
00:35:02,261 --> 00:35:03,094
between good and evil and that that 
determines the destiny of being and it 

536
00:35:07,211 --> 00:35:08,044
isn't obvious to me at all,
that that's something that you would 

537
00:35:09,581 --> 00:35:10,414
wish upon yourself and so one of the 
advantages to be nihilistic is it 

538
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:14,524
enables you to be totally irresponsible 
even though the price you pay for that 

539
00:35:17,771 --> 00:35:19,750
is the sacrifice of all positive 
meaning.

540
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,423
Well,
so much for the intellectual purity of 

541
00:35:22,571 --> 00:35:23,720
nihilism.
Right?

542
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,053
And so those sorts of things have to be 
considered very deeply because when 

543
00:35:28,421 --> 00:35:29,260
someone says,
well,

544
00:35:29,261 --> 00:35:31,450
I'm hopeless,
sometimes it's because they're suffering

545
00:35:31,451 --> 00:35:33,280
and people can suffer terribly because 
of that,

546
00:35:33,281 --> 00:35:37,800
but sometimes it's because they don't 
want to be responsible for anything.

547
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:43,670
And no wonder
back to your point,

548
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,960
young started to examine

549
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,850
religious idiation.
I would say symbolically,

550
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,940
but it's more complicated than that 
because you might think that the attempt

551
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:03,774
to analyze religious thinking 
symbolically would reduce it to nothing 

552
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:08,214
about psychology,
but that isn't what happens precisely 

553
00:36:11,641 --> 00:36:14,910
because it's as you reduce the religious
ideas to psychology,

554
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:15,744
you elevate the psyche and so they meet 
in the middle and this is something you 

555
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,670
understood very,
very well.

556
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,900
It was for that reason that he believed 
that Christ was a symbol of the self,

557
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,763
the self being your full totality.
That might be one way of thinking about 

558
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:31,170
it.
Everything that you could conceivably be

559
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,180
if you were everything that you could 
be,

560
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,433
and that's that potential,
that risks inside you that everyone 

561
00:36:36,181 --> 00:36:36,931
knows about.
You know,

562
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:37,764
we also even speak about it because we 
take people to task when we say you're 

563
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:44,460
not living up to your potential and 
everyone knows what that means,

564
00:36:44,461 --> 00:36:47,460
but no one knows what it means because 
what the hell is that potential?

565
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:49,980
It's not something that's real.
By definition,

566
00:36:49,981 --> 00:36:53,730
it's something that's virtual.
It's something that is yet to be and may

567
00:36:53,731 --> 00:36:54,564
never be,
but we still treat it as if it's real 

568
00:36:56,521 --> 00:37:00,420
and we also treat the entire world as if
it's made out of potential and I believe

569
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:02,220
that that is the correct way of viewing 
the world.

570
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:07,221
It's not the dead matter of the 18th 
century,

571
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,160
rationalist or empiricists.
It's the living domain of potential that

572
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:18,540
we interact with on a regular basis from
which at least to some degree,

573
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:20,040
we extract our own potential.

574
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,093
Here's a rough outline of the story that
that young told that I've been working 

575
00:37:29,001 --> 00:37:29,834
on.
So I'm going to tell it as I understand 

576
00:37:31,461 --> 00:37:32,294
it,

577
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:37,120
according to the,
this,

578
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,550
the selection of stories that were 
encapsulated in,

579
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:44,300
in the biblical tradition.
The world is roughly 6,000 years old.

580
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,290
And of course at one level of analysis 
that's palpably absurd.

581
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,700
I would say.
Um,

582
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:50,953
and also narrow because I think to 
conceptualize the world has 15 billion 

583
00:37:55,281 --> 00:37:56,114
years old with a developmental history 
that extends across that massive amount 

584
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:00,464
of time.
And to note that it extends 

585
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:07,600
incomprehensibly vastly outward is a 
much more magnificent view of the cosmos

586
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:13,421
than the rather constrained cosmos that 
we inherited from thinkers in the Middle

587
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,570
East,
say 10,000 years ago.

588
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:23,500
But there's something about it that's 
true and the truth in it seems to be its

589
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:27,830
relationship to the origin of 
civilization because it is the case that

590
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:33,100
civilization everywhere in the world of 
the sort that we would regard as complex

591
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:34,544
and technologically is about 6,000 years
old and why that is is not so self 

592
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:39,070
evident.

593
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:39,903
Although I suspect it has something to 
do with how long it took us to 

594
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:44,320
reformulate ourselves after the last ice
age,

595
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:47,770
which of course was only roughly 15,000 
years ago.

596
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,850
It's not really that far away in time.
So that's the first thing.

597
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:56,851
But the second thing is what the story,
the creation stories in genesis,

598
00:38:57,371 --> 00:38:59,410
for example,
actually mean because they actually mean

599
00:38:59,411 --> 00:39:00,244
something.
And what they mean is absolutely 

600
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,463
remarkable in my estimation.
And so I'm going to tell you a little 

601
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:05,494
bit about that story
because it's necessary to understand 

602
00:39:09,671 --> 00:39:10,504
what the story means to determine if 
what Nisha said about the inevitable 

603
00:39:13,271 --> 00:39:18,271
destruction of our symbolic religious 
structures by science was inevitable and

604
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:21,640
necessary.
And I think the answer to that is no,

605
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,713
we just didn't understand what the hell 
we were doing any more than we really 

606
00:39:25,301 --> 00:39:27,760
understand why we put up Christmas trees
at Christmas.

607
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:29,823
So we do that in part because the 
Christmas tree is a symbol of life 

608
00:39:32,591 --> 00:39:33,424
because the tree is a symbol of life 
because we inhabited trees for untold 

609
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:37,324
millions of years and we put lights on 
the trees to symbolize the coming back 

610
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,680
into the darkness of Midwinter of the 
Sun and the light.

611
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:45,993
And so we play this symbolic game that 
celebrates both life and the emergence 

612
00:39:49,811 --> 00:39:50,644
of light and consciousness.
And we associate that with the birth of 

613
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:54,820
the savior.
But we don't know that we're doing that,

614
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,370
but we do it anyways.
And,

615
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,920
and we do that sort of thing all the 
time because we're smarter than we know.

616
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,680
And that has to be the case because we 
don't know ourselves.

617
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:06,220
We would need a psychology or sociology 
and anthropology or any of those things.

618
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,930
If we were transparent to ourselves.
We're machines,

619
00:40:09,931 --> 00:40:13,270
so to speak,
that are far more intelligent and wise.

620
00:40:13,271 --> 00:40:17,980
Then the machines themselves can 
understand and we've reveal ourselves to

621
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:18,741
ourselves.
You know,

622
00:40:18,741 --> 00:40:21,460
our action and our symbolic gestures 
constantly.

623
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,473
And then have to reflect on that to try 
to understand what it is that we're up 

624
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,313
to.
So here's the idea that looks at the 

625
00:40:31,581 --> 00:40:33,830
beginning of Genesis.
So

626
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,510
there's,
there's three elements that are involved

627
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:41,030
in the creation of,
of habitable,

628
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:46,650
the creation of habitable order from 
chaos at the beginning of time.

629
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,160
One of them is whatever is represented 
by God,

630
00:40:50,161 --> 00:40:50,994
the father,
and one of them is whatever is 

631
00:40:52,051 --> 00:40:55,950
represented by the chaos that exists at 
the same time.

632
00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:00,030
And the other is whatever is represented
by the idea of God's word.

633
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,220
That's the logos from a Christian 
perspective,

634
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,750
which is a very,
very strange idea.

635
00:41:03,751 --> 00:41:04,584
So there's this idea that was developed 
over the course of thousands of years 

636
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:12,970
that a redeeming savior was also the 
thing that God used to extract habitable

637
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:16,080
order out of chaos at the beginning of 
time.

638
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,333
It's a very strange idea and and to to 
assimilate an idea of that 

639
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,553
preposterousness and magnitude to mirror
pre irrational superstition is foolish 

640
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,190
first of all,
because we don't even understand what it

641
00:41:29,191 --> 00:41:30,024
means,
but it means something outwardly 

642
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,980
profound and it means something

643
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,740
that we cannot forget.
We forget that at our peril.

644
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:44,500
The story at the beginning of Genesis 
means that structure,

645
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,510
that's the father,
that's the patriarchy,

646
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:51,050
if you will,
structure extracts habitable,

647
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:51,884
order from chaos through speech.
That's what we do is says in genesis as 

648
00:41:59,211 --> 00:42:00,044
well,
that human beings are made in the image 

649
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:05,951
of God and that's why because we've 
observed these are ancient ideas,

650
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,990
they were,
they were created with so much blood and

651
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:12,500
effort that it's incalculable.
You cannot contemplate it.

652
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,590
Now idea is that there's something about
the human being,

653
00:42:15,591 --> 00:42:16,424
whatever it is that makes us conscious,
that interacts with the chaotic 

654
00:42:19,491 --> 00:42:20,324
potential that constitutes reality and 
extracts out from that the order within 

655
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:25,184
which we live and that there's something
divine about that and that's the value 

656
00:42:29,241 --> 00:42:30,320
of the human being,
right?

657
00:42:30,321 --> 00:42:31,154
That's the ineradicable value of the 
human being and the idea that each 

658
00:42:34,731 --> 00:42:36,320
individual,
even criminals,

659
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:37,154
even murderers,
the worst and most reprehensible people 

660
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,693
have to be treated with the respect due 
a divinity because we partake in the 

661
00:42:45,081 --> 00:42:49,580
capacity to extract habitable order from
chaos with our consciousness,

662
00:42:49,581 --> 00:42:50,414
with our speech and with our capacity to
communicate and we recognize insofar as 

663
00:42:54,141 --> 00:42:57,020
we each recognize the other as valuable.

664
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:58,843
It's predicated on that observation.
We each have something to offer each 

665
00:43:01,881 --> 00:43:02,714
other and something vital and you know 
that if you engage in a real 

666
00:43:05,061 --> 00:43:05,894
conversation with someone,
a meaningful conversation that suspends 

667
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,200
your sense of fragile mortality for a 
moment.

668
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:16,070
You understand that in that 
communication between paypal,

669
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:16,904
something of inestimable value emerges 
that you have to pursue and you live 

670
00:43:21,021 --> 00:43:21,800
for,
that.

671
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,780
You live for that relationship with 
yourself.

672
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:27,050
You live for that.
That discovery of that relationship,

673
00:43:27,051 --> 00:43:29,030
when you're engaged in an artistic 
pursuit,

674
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:33,020
it's the core of meaning in life and 
it's not an illusion,

675
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:34,123
in fact,
it's a manifestation of the highest 

676
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:36,794
functions of your nervous system because
what your nervous system does is 

677
00:43:40,341 --> 00:43:45,341
signaled to you that you're in a place 
and time that you cannot see when you're

678
00:43:45,921 --> 00:43:50,540
engaged in something meaningful you need
comes upon you and it's the cure for the

679
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:53,480
catastrophes of tragic mortality.

680
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,140
That wonderful engagement in what's 
meaningful that you do,

681
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,033
you can undo experience and that you can
get better at experiencing if you 

682
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:02,114
practice,
and that's because your nervous system 

683
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,450
which has evolved over billions of 
years,

684
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:13,990
has learned to tell you when you're 
standing on the border between chaos and

685
00:44:15,081 --> 00:44:15,914
order and keeping them in balance and 
that's what manifests itself as 

686
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,074
meaningful and that's the same phenomena
that's referred to in the creation 

687
00:44:25,161 --> 00:44:25,994
stories in genesis and it's the same 
idea that's reflected in this strange 

688
00:44:29,781 --> 00:44:30,614
Christian insistence that the thing that
saves mankind is the same thing that 

689
00:44:34,261 --> 00:44:36,750
draws order from chaos at the beginning 
of time.

690
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:37,943
It's unbelievably brilliant and we've 
been trying to figure it out for who 

691
00:44:42,841 --> 00:44:47,700
knows how long forever and have never 
been able to fully articulate it because

692
00:44:47,701 --> 00:44:50,850
it's so complicated.
It's such a complicated idea,

693
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:53,820
but there's nothing in the lease that's 
illusory about it.

694
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,520
The habitable order that is created at 
the beginning of time.

695
00:45:02,521 --> 00:45:03,630
That's paradise,
right?

696
00:45:03,631 --> 00:45:05,250
Paradise.
That's a walled garden.

697
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:06,893
It's a well watered place.
That's what he did means Paradise Means 

698
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:12,870
Paradise is a walled garden and that's 
where Adam and Eve are first put.

699
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,520
And why is that?
Well,

700
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:18,030
it's because we do comment,
male and female form.

701
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,980
That's part of it.
So that's part of our,

702
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,160
our eternal landscape that that's how 
you can think about it,

703
00:45:23,161 --> 00:45:26,040
is it's the landscape that transcends 
all landscapes.

704
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:30,090
It's the landscape that is what all 
landscapes have in common.

705
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,190
That's what it is.
That's what makes it an archetype.

706
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,320
It's a walled garden.
Why?

707
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,393
Well,
the walls are structure and culture and 

708
00:45:37,021 --> 00:45:37,854
the garden is nature and all that says 
is that people live in an amalgam of 

709
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:41,904
nature and culture and of course that's 
precisely the case and that's another 

710
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:47,190
variant of the order.
Chaos,

711
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:49,623
juxtaposition,
order being culture and chaos being 

712
00:45:51,521 --> 00:45:52,354
nature and so we live eternally in the 
balance between nature and culture and 

713
00:45:57,611 --> 00:46:00,730
if it's properly balanced,
it's as close to paradise as it can get,

714
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,000
but paradise is flawed and why is it 
flawed?

715
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,793
Because there's always something lurking
in it that can turn it upside down and 

716
00:46:09,191 --> 00:46:10,024
that's the snake and the reason it's a 
snake is because the circuits that we 

717
00:46:13,601 --> 00:46:14,434
use to process the things that turn our 
lives upside down is the same circuit 

718
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:24,090
that are tree dwelling.
Ancestors used to identify predators $60

719
00:46:24,641 --> 00:46:25,474
million years ago,
and so the symbolic structure has 

720
00:46:28,091 --> 00:46:28,924
remained exactly the same.
That which lies outside what you 

721
00:46:31,901 --> 00:46:35,350
understand is predatory and dangerous.
Well,

722
00:46:35,351 --> 00:46:39,640
that's why you demonize others.
The foreign others because they do stand

723
00:46:39,641 --> 00:46:40,474
in that relationship to you and you use 
extraordinarily deep circuitry to do 

724
00:46:43,511 --> 00:46:44,344
that,
but human beings being slightly smarter 

725
00:46:46,001 --> 00:46:46,834
than your average chimpanzee also have 
noted that the terrible Predator that 

726
00:46:50,411 --> 00:46:51,244
lurks outside the domains of what you 
understand is also the thing that bears 

727
00:46:54,461 --> 00:46:55,180
gold.

728
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,610
Right?
And that's the Classic Dragon Myth.

729
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:58,563
The hero goes out beyond the confines of
order and culture into the chaotic 

730
00:47:02,141 --> 00:47:02,974
unknown,
to confront the ultimate Predator who 

731
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:09,310
simultaneously offers the best that can 
be possibly gathered,

732
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,220
and that's what human beings are like.
Predator,

733
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,173
animals and prey animals simultaneously 
we've learned to represent the unknown 

734
00:47:17,291 --> 00:47:21,880
is that thing that threatens us.
Hideously with a multitude of paralyzing

735
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:26,830
snakes in the head of Medusa,
but continually also offers us precisely

736
00:47:26,831 --> 00:47:27,664
what we need to continue our movement 
and everyone knows that which is why we 

737
00:47:31,151 --> 00:47:31,984
go to movies that tell us that over and 
over and over and over and over trying 

738
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,144
to learn what it means and that's what 
it means and that's what it means to 

739
00:47:40,271 --> 00:47:45,271
partake in the logos and the logos.
The reason that I made the videos that I

740
00:47:46,401 --> 00:47:47,234
made in September in relationship to 
free speech is because I know that 

741
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:51,813
respect for the logos and respect for 
free speech are the same thing and that 

742
00:47:55,721 --> 00:47:56,554
without that respect,
our societies cannot maintain their 

743
00:47:59,111 --> 00:48:01,870
structure,
differentiate and progress.

744
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:02,823
They cannot do it.
We use our free speech to face the 

745
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:11,320
chaotic potential of the world and its 
horrors to structure it,

746
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:13,750
to understand it,
to communicate about it,

747
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:17,590
and to reach consensus.
It's the mechanism by which we adapt.

748
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:18,573
There can be no restrictions put upon 
that unless you want to sacrifice 

749
00:48:22,091 --> 00:48:25,960
adaptations,
and I wouldn't recommend that things get

750
00:48:25,961 --> 00:48:28,300
stale,
old decay,

751
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:33,570
dad and dangerous with extraordinary 
rapidity if living people don't maintain

752
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:34,954
their responsibility to update the state
and there's no difference between that 

753
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,173
and diving down into the chaotic depths 
and rescuing your father from the belly 

754
00:48:45,071 --> 00:48:47,680
of the whale.
It's exactly the same idea.

755
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:48,743
It's an ancient,
ancient idea and the reason that we 

756
00:48:52,211 --> 00:48:57,010
haven't forgotten it was because 
everyone who forgot it died.

757
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,710
So unless that's where we want to go,
we better stop forgetting about it.

758
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:13,843
Nature said that after God had died,
there would be two things that would 

759
00:49:16,551 --> 00:49:17,384
happen.
One would be the emergence of nihilism 

760
00:49:20,241 --> 00:49:22,610
as a temptation,
and we already discussed nihilism.

761
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,300
It's like it's a logical consequence of 
the collapse of value systems,

762
00:49:26,301 --> 00:49:27,134
but it's also a place for the 
irresponsible to hide fine nihilism 

763
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,950
totalitarianism.
Well,

764
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:36,243
we need you to believe that once you had
experienced the collapse of one value 

765
00:49:39,801 --> 00:49:40,634
system,
you are unlikely to put your faith in 

766
00:49:42,231 --> 00:49:47,231
any value systems.
So then why totalitarianism particularly

767
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:48,123
say it.
It's nationalistic and communitarian 

768
00:49:50,931 --> 00:49:53,510
forums,
which are the two forms that we saw,

769
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:58,400
act as immense devils in the 20th 
century,

770
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,293
right?
With nationalism being pushed most 

771
00:50:01,221 --> 00:50:02,054
forcefully forward by the sorts of 
political creeds that were exemplified 

772
00:50:05,181 --> 00:50:06,014
by the Nazis and with communitarianism 
being put forth by the sorts of creams 

773
00:50:09,321 --> 00:50:11,000
that were exemplified by the Soviet 
Union.

774
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:15,890
Both absolutely catastrophic 
evolutionary dead ends.

775
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,430
Well,
nationalism is easier to understand,

776
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,570
I think because

777
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:25,003
you need an identity and it has to be 
collective because human beings live 

778
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:29,760
collectively.
I mean,

779
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:30,703
it's the fact that we share an identity 
that we can all sit here in this room 

780
00:50:34,551 --> 00:50:38,720
peacefully because the identity is 
partly who you think you are,

781
00:50:38,721 --> 00:50:39,554
but it's also partly what you expect 
from the world and from others and 

782
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,160
because you have an identity that's 
similar to you,

783
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:47,143
you can sit together peacefully because 
you expect and desire something and so 

784
00:50:51,321 --> 00:50:52,154
to you and it's the same thing and 
that's what it means to have a shared 

785
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:55,484
culture and so you can't.
You have to defend that culture and it 

786
00:50:58,191 --> 00:51:02,900
has to be of sufficient,
let's say tightness or magnitude so that

787
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:03,973
it makes sense for you to belong to it.
It's not so diverse and chaotic that it 

788
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:09,164
means nothing and I think that part of 
the reason why we're seeing a return to 

789
00:51:13,251 --> 00:51:16,040
nationalism in places like Europe is 
because

790
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:18,523
the European identity is so amorphous 
that people can't establish a 

791
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:22,874
relationship with it and that's not a 
good thing because identity is actually 

792
00:51:25,821 --> 00:51:27,710
something you have to have a 
relationship with.

793
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,370
And so you know,
it's the identity,

794
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:30,243
your identity.
It's the identity of you within your 

795
00:51:31,461 --> 00:51:32,294
family.
It's the identity of your family within 

796
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,473
the small community of friends that 
surround you and then the broader 

797
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:38,894
community of the town and a somewhat 
broader community of the province and 

798
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:44,030
the state and so forth,
but as it expands,

799
00:51:44,031 --> 00:51:49,031
it gets vague and it disperses and at 
some point the identity that's universal

800
00:51:49,251 --> 00:51:50,084
is so all encompassing that it means 
nothing at all and leaves people 

801
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,970
chaotic,
and so that's what's happening,

802
00:51:55,971 --> 00:51:56,804
at least in part in Europe.
It's happening to some degree in the 

803
00:51:58,970 --> 00:51:59,803
United States as well because we've been
pushed so quickly forward into adopting 

804
00:52:03,471 --> 00:52:08,330
a global identity that people are 
shaking because that's too amorphous for

805
00:52:08,331 --> 00:52:10,070
them.
And so we pulled back and say,

806
00:52:10,071 --> 00:52:10,904
no,
we need to be around people who we 

807
00:52:12,261 --> 00:52:15,800
understand.
Which is of course absolutely true.

808
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,173
Now the downside of the nationalist 
endeavor is that you also need to be 

809
00:52:20,841 --> 00:52:24,560
around people that you aren't alike and 
don't understand,

810
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,530
partly because they exist and if you 
don't take them into account,

811
00:52:27,531 --> 00:52:28,850
then you're going to have a war with 
them.

812
00:52:28,851 --> 00:52:29,684
Which is a very bad idea.
But also because they have something to 

813
00:52:31,851 --> 00:52:32,684
offer.
And so we're trying to sort out the 

814
00:52:34,191 --> 00:52:37,730
proper balance between differentiated 
identity,

815
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:39,373
say at the nation state level and the 
global identity that seems to be 

816
00:52:42,081 --> 00:52:45,980
manifesting itself partly because of our
widespread electronic communication.

817
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:47,203
So,
okay,

818
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:50,300
nationalism beckons.
If you're in a chaotic state,

819
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:52,760
you know,
I heard the Gallup people that pollsters

820
00:52:52,761 --> 00:52:55,370
at one point,
I had never seen this made public,

821
00:52:55,371 --> 00:52:58,790
but I remember it very well said that,
uh,

822
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:01,303
this was back when Quebec was still a 
large proportion of the Quebecois 

823
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,270
population was still agitating for 
separatism.

824
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,120
I'd always looked at that and I thought,
well,

825
00:53:09,121 --> 00:53:14,121
it made perfect sense because you,
if cal Catholicism collapses,

826
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:15,074
it leaves a void.
What are you going to fill the void 

827
00:53:16,431 --> 00:53:17,330
with?
Well,

828
00:53:17,331 --> 00:53:20,460
it's either nihilism,
which we've already discussed or well,

829
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,560
or what.
Well,

830
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:22,603
nationalism obviously,
and the Gallup people said that if you 

831
00:53:24,891 --> 00:53:25,724
are a lapsed Catholic,
you are 10 times more likely to be a 

832
00:53:27,391 --> 00:53:28,890
separate.
It's perfect.

833
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:31,950
It's exactly what you'd expect because 
you have to have an identity.

834
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:36,600
So you turn from church to state.
Well that's fine if you believe that the

835
00:53:36,601 --> 00:53:37,434
state is the ultimate identity.
And that's really this story that is 

836
00:53:41,311 --> 00:53:43,890
being sold to people who are sold a 
nationalist story.

837
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,990
The state is the ultimate identity.
It's like,

838
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:50,220
well actually that's technically wrong.
That's why.

839
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,143
That's why it's wrong.
It's not wrong because it's 

840
00:53:52,621 --> 00:53:55,700
ideologically wrong or morally wrong.
Precisely it's,

841
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:57,690
it's wrong because it's technically 
wrong.

842
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:58,733
Because the problem with the state is 
the state is what's uniform across 

843
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:02,364
people
and the thing is is that we need what's 

844
00:54:06,031 --> 00:54:06,864
actually diverse across people in order 
to rejuvenate the state and to keep it 

845
00:54:10,561 --> 00:54:11,394
awake.
And so if you reduce individuals to 

846
00:54:13,621 --> 00:54:16,710
what's homogenous about them across all 
people,

847
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:21,210
you eradicate the very variability that 
allows people to adapt to new things.

848
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:24,120
And because we're constantly being 
presented with new things,

849
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:27,360
we need to keep that individual 
variability

850
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,173
paramount because it's upon that 
variability that the very state depends 

851
00:54:32,961 --> 00:54:33,794
on.
That's actually what the West 

852
00:54:34,281 --> 00:54:35,114
discovered.
That's why we have always subordinated 

853
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:40,010
the state to the divinity of the 
individual.

854
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:43,070
And that's expressed,
as I already said in our,

855
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,593
in our,
in the primacy of free speech in our 

856
00:54:46,731 --> 00:54:49,160
civilization.
It's the cornerstone,

857
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,293
the primacy of free speech,
and it's because the individual has 

858
00:54:53,121 --> 00:54:53,954
something to offer the state,
and so state identity is something that 

859
00:54:57,201 --> 00:54:59,930
can only it constructure and it can 
reassure,

860
00:54:59,931 --> 00:55:02,930
but it also constrains to too great a 
degree,

861
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:08,110
and so societies that become only state 
immediately become old and blind,

862
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:14,060
malevolent and collapse,
and that's an ancient story.

863
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:14,894
The Egyptians had this figured out 3000 
years ago in their fundamental 

864
00:55:17,841 --> 00:55:18,674
mythologies.
They had a daddy named Cyrus who was 

865
00:55:20,721 --> 00:55:25,280
threatened by his evil brothers set who 
later became the Christian Satan.

866
00:55:25,281 --> 00:55:26,114
The words are related.
Etymologically and set was like scar in 

867
00:55:30,261 --> 00:55:31,094
the lion king.
He was waiting in the wings to for the 

868
00:55:34,851 --> 00:55:35,684
old king to turn a blind eye so that he 
could chop them into pieces and rule in 

869
00:55:41,061 --> 00:55:43,640
a malevolent way across the entire 
state.

870
00:55:43,641 --> 00:55:44,474
The Egyptians had another day at a 
horace who was the son of Cyrus and the 

871
00:55:47,481 --> 00:55:49,040
queen of the underworld.
Isis,

872
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:50,263
who is the eye,
the Egyptian I who was the fall can 

873
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:54,950
because falcons can see,
and horace was different than,

874
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,770
oh cyrus,
because he could see what set was up to.

875
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,780
He grew up outside the kingdom like King
Arthur and came back and try and find,

876
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:02,850
overcame,
set,

877
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,640
losing an eye in the process

878
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,210
you overcame as evil uncle and banished 
him to the corners of the world and then

879
00:56:10,211 --> 00:56:11,044
he took his eyes,
went into the underworld where his 

880
00:56:12,341 --> 00:56:12,831
father,
oh,

881
00:56:12,831 --> 00:56:17,350
cyrus was living a life of a of a dead 
ghosts.

882
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:21,810
That's one way of thinking about it and 
he gave him his eye and that revivify to

883
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:22,653
cyrus,
Cyrus and horus went back up to the 

884
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:25,114
surface from the chaotic underworld and 
their union was the symbol of what the 

885
00:56:29,231 --> 00:56:32,860
Pharaoh had to manifest in order to rule
Egypt properly.

886
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:36,330
The Egyptians figured that out 3000 
years ago in their.

887
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:37,303
In their great story,
but it's very difficult to make 

888
00:56:39,911 --> 00:56:41,950
something like that and articulated 
reality,

889
00:56:41,951 --> 00:56:42,784
but that's the relationship that has to 
obtain between the individual and the 

890
00:56:45,011 --> 00:56:46,930
state.
The state is a corpse.

891
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:50,680
The state is dead,
but it's a gift that the dead have given

892
00:56:50,681 --> 00:56:55,681
to you and you have to provide it with 
vision and with speech because otherwise

893
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:58,720
it can only blunder around like a 
Zombie.

894
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:02,283
You go to university,
you become educated so that you can 

895
00:57:04,271 --> 00:57:07,870
serve as the eye and the mouth of the 
rejuvenated state.

896
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:08,733
That's the purpose of developing.
Say had an education in the humanities 

897
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:16,180
when there was still such a thing left,
but that's the purpose of that education

898
00:57:16,181 --> 00:57:17,014
is to turn you into the thing that 
ensures that the entire ship doesn't 

899
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:24,540
founder in sync and that's your 
responsibility and if you're looking for

900
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:27,340
a meaning in your life,
that's the meaning.

901
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:30,310
Keep the state afloat.
Why?

902
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,173
Well,
because it's better for us all to be in 

903
00:57:32,381 --> 00:57:36,160
a ship than drowning in the icy water,
and that's the alternative.

904
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,353
No one if you're.
If you find that the tragedy of life is 

905
00:57:40,151 --> 00:57:40,984
too much for you to bear without 
becoming resentful and bitter and 

906
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:44,853
murderous and even genocidal,
it means that you haven't picked up 

907
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:48,214
enough responsibility because if you 
picked up enough responsibility for the 

908
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:55,420
rejuvenation of the state and the 
eradication of unnecessary suffering,

909
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:56,403
you find enough meaning in that so the 
idea of meaninglessness would vanish in 

910
00:57:59,951 --> 00:58:00,784
an instant.
You'd have more meaning than you knew 

911
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:05,110
what to do with and that's a terrifying 
thing as well,

912
00:58:05,111 --> 00:58:05,944
but to fight off one terrifying thing,
the specter of mortality and insanity 

913
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:11,523
and finitude and death,
you need another monster of equivalent 

914
00:58:14,651 --> 00:58:15,484
size and that's one that you can find 
and it's one that you can bear up and 

915
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:20,704
it's one that you can live and that's 
what we need to do because if we don't 

916
00:58:24,491 --> 00:58:29,470
do that,
then all hell breaks loose really,

917
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:33,640
really eternally.
That's what those stories mean.

918
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:45,180
Viewed in this light.
You can understand postmodernism because

919
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:46,253
postmodernism managers has a response.
It's a response to the NIETZSCHEAN 

920
00:58:49,561 --> 00:58:50,910
dilemma,
right?

921
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,433
The cornerstone of civilization has been
demolished by rational critique and no 

922
00:58:56,401 --> 00:58:57,234
wonder it needed to be criticized,
but it needed to be more deeply 

923
00:58:59,281 --> 00:59:00,114
understood and criticism and deep 
understanding are the same thing unless 

924
00:59:03,631 --> 00:59:07,290
the criticism is only destruction 
because if you criticize something,

925
00:59:07,291 --> 00:59:09,510
what you're doing is separating the 
wheat from the chaff.

926
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,460
You're not burning all of it.
You're saying,

927
00:59:11,461 --> 00:59:12,181
well,
not this,

928
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:14,010
not this,
but definitely this.

929
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,010
Definitely this,
and that's what education should provide

930
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:17,844
you with the opportunity to do as well.
What should we conserve and what should 

931
00:59:20,551 --> 00:59:23,300
we dispense,
what we can serve,

932
00:59:23,301 --> 00:59:25,670
what centrally true,
and now we need to understand it.

933
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:26,533
We have to conserve the idea that the 
individual has an infinite 

934
00:59:29,271 --> 00:59:30,104
responsibility to the direction of being
and we know that you know perfectly 

935
00:59:34,101 --> 00:59:34,934
well,
that you live in a relationship with 

936
00:59:35,601 --> 00:59:38,660
your own conscience and when you violate
the moral order,

937
00:59:38,661 --> 00:59:40,910
that's part and parcel of your soul.

938
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:44,810
You're ashamed and hide and bitter,
and then you get angry.

939
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:46,700
You can't show your face to other 
people.

940
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,940
You can't even look at yourself in the 
mirror and you know perfectly well.

941
00:59:49,941 --> 00:59:50,774
That's true.
Even though you may not know what to do 

942
00:59:52,431 --> 00:59:53,264
about it or how to get out of it,
it's there's a moral order built into 

943
00:59:56,901 --> 00:59:59,570
human beings.
If there wasn't,

944
00:59:59,571 --> 01:00:00,404
there was no way we could even 
communicate with one another because 

945
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:02,714
there'd be no rules of communication.
There'd be nothing that we mutually 

946
01:00:05,151 --> 01:00:07,370
wanted or expected from each other.
You know,

947
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:08,263
one of the things I figured out is that 
we're all appalled when we run into 

948
01:00:11,961 --> 01:00:15,290
another person who is not yet the 
redeemer.

949
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:17,293
Every person you ever meet your you're 
dissatisfied with because they're not 

950
01:00:20,631 --> 01:00:21,464
who they could be,
and you're broadcasting that message at 

951
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:25,280
everyone all the time.
You're not who you could be.

952
01:00:25,281 --> 01:00:27,650
You're not who you could be.
You're not who you could be.

953
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:28,573
I'm not who I could be and we're all 
facing each other with our emotional 

954
01:00:32,781 --> 01:00:33,614
displays,
pleading with each other to become that 

955
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:40,960
which we could become
and everyone knows it,

956
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:44,470
but we won't do it,
and it's no wonder

957
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:51,310
the postmodernists,
they're the.

958
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:54,400
They're the logical conclusion of the 
Nietzschean dilemma.

959
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:59,560
God is dead value.
The value structure collapsed.

960
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:04,090
The specter of rises of all value 
structures collapsing.

961
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:08,830
That's the postmodernists dogma.
All value structures have collapsed.

962
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:11,980
They're only there for the purposes of 
exclusion.

963
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:15,040
They have no intrinsic value.
It's a very,

964
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:15,933
very powerful argument.
That's why it dominates the 

965
01:01:18,881 --> 01:01:19,714
universities.
That and the fact that it allows people 

966
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,640
to dispense with their moral 
responsibility,

967
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:27,670
which is something that's never 
discussed by the postmodernist,

968
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:30,100
but you have to give the devil his due.

969
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,320
What's the problem with postmodernism?
Well,

970
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:37,154
if all value structures have collapsed,
then there's nothing to do because in 

971
01:01:41,571 --> 01:01:42,404
order to do something,
one thing has to be better than another 

972
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,433
because otherwise why do it and so 
people who are ensconced in the 

973
01:01:49,011 --> 01:01:53,420
postmodern tradition are undermined by 
their own philosophy.

974
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:56,930
They can deconstruct their own 
deconstruction,

975
01:01:57,170 --> 01:01:58,003
in which case they might as well just 
sit there and do nothing which would 

976
01:02:00,651 --> 01:02:02,660
actually be preferable to what they're 
doing now.

977
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:09,560
So how do they extract themselves from 
that dilemma?

978
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,673
They do ideologically,
but they don't care because the 

979
01:02:14,421 --> 01:02:17,450
postmodernists first of all,
don't believe in logic.

980
01:02:17,451 --> 01:02:21,720
That's a reflection of the logos they've
dispensed with dialogue.

981
01:02:21,721 --> 01:02:22,554
They don't believe that because that's a
reflection of the logos which they've 

982
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:28,200
dispensed with logic and dialogue are 
irrelevant.

983
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:29,423
Well,
that does bring up the problem of what 

984
01:02:30,601 --> 01:02:31,710
to do.
Well,

985
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,553
there's postmodernist finesse that by 
reverting to the Marxist doctrines from 

986
01:02:36,421 --> 01:02:39,300
which postmodernism emerged,
and so they say,

987
01:02:39,301 --> 01:02:40,230
well,
yeah,

988
01:02:40,231 --> 01:02:42,630
you can't get any direction from 
postmodernism,

989
01:02:42,631 --> 01:02:43,590
but we don't.

990
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:44,873
We're not going to worry about that 
because we don't worry about such 

991
01:02:46,171 --> 01:02:49,770
things.
What we'll do is just use slight of hand

992
01:02:49,771 --> 01:02:50,604
to push forward the communitarian 
doctrines out of which our original 

993
01:02:54,211 --> 01:02:57,030
hypothesis emerged and everyone says,
well,

994
01:02:57,031 --> 01:03:01,380
we'll turn a blind eye to the paradox 
because we actually need something to do

995
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,960
and plus to the degree that we're 
communitarian,

996
01:03:04,110 --> 01:03:04,943
we can take out our nihilistic 
resentment and arrogance and in 

997
01:03:08,341 --> 01:03:09,174
gratitude on every single person we 
deemed to have something more than we 

998
01:03:12,781 --> 01:03:13,614
have.
And so if you're wondering why certain 

999
01:03:17,281 --> 01:03:20,850
values can exist in the absence of any 
value,

1000
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:25,530
you have to look no farther than to 
understand that people who are desperate

1001
01:03:25,531 --> 01:03:26,364
and chaotic will still be angry and 
destructive and they can manifest that 

1002
01:03:30,721 --> 01:03:33,600
perfectly with the moral mask that says,
well,

1003
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:37,740
I'm not really after what you have 
because you have a little more than me.

1004
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:40,950
I'm speaking on behalf of these people 
who have even less.

1005
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:41,993
It's like it's absolute nonsense.
It's so funny watching Yale students 

1006
01:03:46,441 --> 01:03:50,100
complain about the privileged.
They're in the top,

1007
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:55,110
one 10th of 100th of a percent of people
who've lived in in the entire history of

1008
01:03:55,111 --> 01:03:55,944
the planet,
much less just the people that are on 

1009
01:03:57,631 --> 01:03:58,464
the planet.
Now they're dominating patriarchs in 

1010
01:04:01,441 --> 01:04:03,150
training,
right there,

1011
01:04:03,151 --> 01:04:03,984
baby representatives of the Patriarchy 
and all they do is complain about that 

1012
01:04:07,891 --> 01:04:08,970
tiny,
tiny,

1013
01:04:08,971 --> 01:04:13,800
infinitesimal fraction of people who 
have slightly more than they have now.

1014
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:19,290
It's appalling and their idiot 
professors pat them on the back and send

1015
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:23,550
them out the world to do that.
Instead of teaching them how to live,

1016
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:26,450
they damaged their mental health.
They they,

1017
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:27,383
they heard our society,
they're bringing things down and that's 

1018
01:04:30,721 --> 01:04:31,554
what they're aiming at.
The postmodernist managed to be 

1019
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:41,460
nihilistic and totalitarian at the same 
time,

1020
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:42,623
which is something that not even need 
should dreamed about despite the fact 

1021
01:04:45,391 --> 01:04:50,040
that he had the greatest imagination for
pathology that perhaps ever existed.

1022
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:51,323
In addition,
they combine the nihilism and 

1023
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,473
totalitarianism with the worst aspects 
of dogmatic religion because what 

1024
01:04:58,621 --> 01:04:59,454
they've essentially established is a 
cult into which children who attend 

1025
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:07,020
university are now indoctrinated at 
great cost,

1026
01:05:07,021 --> 01:05:10,110
I might add and with very little 
practical outcome,

1027
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:18,350
what's the alternative given that they 
have a point as far as I can tell,

1028
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,660
the alternative is a proper return to 
the past,

1029
01:05:22,661 --> 01:05:25,720
and that is precisely to journey into 
the chaos,

1030
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:26,554
to look at the worst possible thing and 
to pull the dead father up from the 

1031
01:05:29,921 --> 01:05:33,190
chaotic depths.
That's how you stop being a puppet.

1032
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:35,103
Someone whose strings are being pulled 
by forces they do not understand behind 

1033
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:39,334
the scenes,

1034
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:45,600
you find out what's great about your 
culture is thing that's provided us with

1035
01:05:45,601 --> 01:05:46,434
everything that we see in this room,
this amazing warmth that we're 

1036
01:05:49,051 --> 01:05:53,160
experiencing when it's 30 bloody below 
outside the fact that the electricity or

1037
01:05:53,161 --> 01:05:55,860
the heart and the computational 
resources are working in that we can all

1038
01:05:55,861 --> 01:05:58,230
sit here peacefully and then no one is 
hungry.

1039
01:05:58,410 --> 01:05:59,730
Fact,
we're too fat.

1040
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:02,100
That's our big problem.
Oh No,

1041
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:05,040
we have so much stuff.
We're getting fat.

1042
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:07,740
Yeah,
well that's a good problem to have.

1043
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:12,300
We should have some gratitude for what's
being produced that's brought us to this

1044
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:15,720
point and we need to wake up and 
understand what we're doing.

1045
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:16,823
Well,
that's what.

1046
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:17,753
That's what people like.
That's what the psychoanalysts were 

1047
01:06:19,651 --> 01:06:20,484
trying to do in the 20th century.
That's what all the great clinicians 

1048
01:06:22,471 --> 01:06:23,304
we're trying to do and I would say above
all else that was what Carl young was 

1049
01:06:26,191 --> 01:06:27,024
trying to do.

1050
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:28,163
He believed firmly that the idea of the 
divine spark within the individual was 

1051
01:06:32,311 --> 01:06:33,144
a,
was a metaphysical reality by which he 

1052
01:06:35,161 --> 01:06:35,994
meant a reality that actually 
transcended and existed super to the 

1053
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:41,874
physical reality of more real reality.
That's whatever consciousness is 

1054
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:48,600
something we understand from a 
scientific perspective,

1055
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:49,523
not at all that's been represented in 
our mythologies as far back as we can 

1056
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:57,750
push them as an independent agent in the
world,

1057
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:01,890
giving rise to form.
That's how we treat each other.

1058
01:07:01,891 --> 01:07:06,270
That's how we recognize ourselves.
That's how we judge each other.

1059
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:11,640
You make your bed and then you lie in it
and everyone knows it,

1060
01:07:11,641 --> 01:07:12,474
and that's not to say that you're not 
subject to random and chaotic 

1061
01:07:14,971 --> 01:07:15,804
circumstances and the tragedy of life.
Just because you can do some things 

1062
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,034
doesn't mean you can do everything,
but you can do some things and if you 

1063
01:07:23,641 --> 01:07:24,474
don't do them,
then things fall apart and the problem 

1064
01:07:27,571 --> 01:07:28,404
with things falling apart is that you 
will be happy about it to the degree 

1065
01:07:31,111 --> 01:07:31,944
that you're not trying to repair them 
because to the degree that you do not 

1066
01:07:34,891 --> 01:07:35,724
manifest what's within you,
then your life falls apart around you 

1067
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:40,163
and everything that could make you 
bitter multiplies until you're in a 

1068
01:07:42,631 --> 01:07:44,790
situation where you want the 
destruction.

1069
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:47,940
You want to bring it on,
and it's not surprising

1070
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:50,523
because life can be so terrible that the
question of whether or not it should 

1071
01:07:52,721 --> 01:07:53,554
exist at all can be a real question.
But the answer to that is his life so 

1072
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:01,390
terrible that it shouldn't exist.
Well,

1073
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:02,224
the answer is it depends on how you live
it and if your life is so terrible that 

1074
01:08:07,121 --> 01:08:07,954
you can't bear it,
then it raises the question of whether 

1075
01:08:09,851 --> 01:08:10,684
or not you're living it properly,
and that's not to say that people don't 

1076
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:17,630
suffer under burdens that are too great 
for them to bear.

1077
01:08:17,631 --> 01:08:18,464
They certainly do.
It doesn't matter because if you let 

1078
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:22,514
that embitter you,
if you let that destroy your allegiance 

1079
01:08:25,341 --> 01:08:26,174
to the proper path,
all it does is make that worse and 

1080
01:08:28,611 --> 01:08:31,040
everything else.
It's no out.

1081
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:44,453
So what did I learn from studying
from studying the terrible situation 

1082
01:08:50,131 --> 01:08:50,964
that obtained in the mid 19 eighties 
when the Soviets and the West had tens 

1083
01:08:57,330 --> 01:09:01,050
of thousands of hydrogen bombs pointed 
at each other,

1084
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:05,280
ready to go at a moment's notice.
Why did that happen?

1085
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:07,470
What did I learn?
It was simple.

1086
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:13,760
The reason that that situation existed 
was because I was not good enough.

1087
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:16,523
I was not good enough.
The reason that the terrible situations 

1088
01:09:19,261 --> 01:09:22,230
in the world exists now is because 
you're not good enough.

1089
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:24,840
You're not good enough,
you're not good enough.

1090
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:29,070
We could solve any problem.
We can solve any problem.

1091
01:09:29,071 --> 01:09:31,500
If we used all the resources that were 
available to us,

1092
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,590
if we live properly,
we have no idea what we could turn,

1093
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:39,300
what were in into,
so I would say

1094
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:43,323
you support free speech because it's the
mechanism that maintains the sanity of 

1095
01:09:49,241 --> 01:09:54,241
the individual and society and you live 
in relationship with the spoken truth to

1096
01:09:56,951 --> 01:10:00,700
the best of your ability because the 
alternative is hell,

1097
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:02,373
and if hell is what you want,
then you can remain arrogant and 

1098
01:10:06,131 --> 01:10:06,964
resentful and deceitful,
but if you want to work to better the 

1099
01:10:09,311 --> 01:10:11,500
world to bring it up to what it might 
be,

1100
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:13,323
then you speak forthrightly.
You clarify yourself and you act 

1101
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:21,910
properly in the world and then you see 
what happens,

1102
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,253
and this is the final thing I'll say,
I spent a long time studying the sermon 

1103
01:10:26,741 --> 01:10:29,080
on the mount.
It's a key document.

1104
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:33,880
It's Christ's commentary on the Ten 
Commandments.

1105
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:36,400
In a sense,
the question being,

1106
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:40,060
if you codify the rules by which a 
society might function,

1107
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:41,103
is there something within the structure 
of the rules that rises above them that 

1108
01:10:44,561 --> 01:10:47,830
acts as the fundamental principle from 
which they're all derived?

1109
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:50,470
It's the ultimate question of human 
ethics.

1110
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:55,000
What is the highest principle and the 
answer that's put forth in the sermon on

1111
01:10:55,001 --> 01:10:55,834
the mount is quite straightforward.
Aim at the highest possible good that 

1112
01:10:59,441 --> 01:11:00,274
you can conceive of whatever that is 
that you can conceive of that serves as 

1113
01:11:04,001 --> 01:11:06,460
your God.
For all intents and purposes,

1114
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:12,330
having aligned yourself with that good,
speak the truth and see what happens.

1115
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:15,623
That's the act of faith.
The act of faith is whatever the truth 

1116
01:11:20,131 --> 01:11:22,560
reveals is the best of all possible 
worlds.

1117
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:27,000
Regardless of how it appears to you.
Now it's a guess,

1118
01:11:27,001 --> 01:11:27,480
right?
It's a.

1119
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:30,450
it's something you stake a bat on.
Well,

1120
01:11:30,451 --> 01:11:34,290
what do you think the best of all 
possible worlds will be brought into?

1121
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:37,380
Being by deceit,
it seems unlikely.

1122
01:11:37,381 --> 01:11:39,060
You know that doesn't work in your own 
life.

1123
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:41,490
You Tangle yourself up in your own lies,
right?

1124
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:42,323
One lie breeds Tandon.
10 breeds a hundred and maybe you put 

1125
01:11:45,031 --> 01:11:45,864
the consequences on down the road and 
you don't fall into the pit for five or 

1126
01:11:48,391 --> 01:11:50,820
six years.
Maybe you've even forgotten why you fell

1127
01:11:50,821 --> 01:11:53,700
in when you finally do fall in,
but everyone knows that.

1128
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:58,820
Everyone knows that you don't get away 
with anything and so the issue is,

1129
01:11:59,191 --> 01:12:00,024
well,
what would happen if you just said what 

1130
01:12:01,891 --> 01:12:05,040
you thought stupid as it is,
inaccurate as it is,

1131
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:05,993
and listen to people criticize you in 
response to shape you and make you more 

1132
01:12:09,301 --> 01:12:10,134
articulate.
What would your life be like and 

1133
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:12,423
answered?
That is,

1134
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,270
and I know this to be true,
I've worked with many,

1135
01:12:15,271 --> 01:12:16,104
many people on precisely this problem.
Your life gets better and better and 

1136
01:12:20,311 --> 01:12:21,144
better and richer and deeper,
but that comes with a heavier and 

1137
01:12:25,261 --> 01:12:27,870
heavier burden of responsibility.
Well,

1138
01:12:27,871 --> 01:12:28,704
that's okay.
You use the observation of your own 

1139
01:12:31,111 --> 01:12:36,111
capability to bear responsibility to 
buttress yourself against the terrorists

1140
01:12:36,601 --> 01:12:38,820
of being finite.
You say,

1141
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:40,943
we can miserable as I am.
I can still stand up to the terrible 

1142
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:49,890
tragedy of life and prevail and that's 
good enough.

1143
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:57,550
Thank thanks.
