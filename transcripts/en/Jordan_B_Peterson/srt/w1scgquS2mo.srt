1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,280
Turns into Durga if you treat her 
property,

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:03,443
and I didn't use dirt because I wanted 
to show that I actually got accused by 

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,910
someone being a racist because I did 
this.

4
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:10,390
It was quite funny because they said,
well,

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,253
you use the into orders to indicate 
chaos in the Greco Roman goddess to 

6
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:15,954
indicate benevolence.
And that was obviously an indication of 

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:22,410
life fundamental pathology.
Anyways,

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,363
it is.
I just want them to show that the idea 

9
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:28,890
of the benevolent God isn't limited to a
single culture.

10
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:29,970
You know,
there's Diana,

11
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:32,100
she's got a lot of breasts.
That's what's,

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:33,723
that's what's down in front there.
So she's like the nourishing element of 

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,293
being the best way to think about it and
the nourishing element of being emerges 

14
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:44,004
in this sort of fashion.
So that's the differentiation of the 

15
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:49,230
archetype.
So way at the back there's the predatory

16
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,540
serpent chaos that lurks in the 
background.

17
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:54,200
And then that fragments.
I'll did one more differentiated.

18
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:57,720
So I would in one direction into the 
feminine and the Feminine.

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,310
This is a tough one because there's this
weird interaction here with,

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,940
with gender and archetype,
you know,

21
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:10,680
so.
So here's something to think about,

22
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,380
and I'm,
I'm,

23
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,303
I'm floundering on this because I have 
for a long time because it's very 

24
00:01:18,281 --> 00:01:19,114
difficult.
Which gender of person are you most 

25
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:25,400
likely to see on the cover of men's 
magazine?

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,833
A woman,
my gender and most likely to see on the 

27
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,340
cover of Woman's magazine.
Why?

28
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,630
Why is that?
Yes,

29
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,140
that's right.
I think that's why I think that's why.

30
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,243
And that means that they're both 
possessed by the same archetype in a 

31
00:01:51,951 --> 00:01:52,784
different way.
And the archetype is the architect will 

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,640
feminine fundamentally and for Women The
archetypal feminine is a judge and a and

33
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:03,230
an ideal,
the judge is,

34
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,150
well,
how far do you deviate from that?

35
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,970
The ideal is to what degree can you 
emulate?

36
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,550
And then from them it's the same damn 
thing.

37
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,300
The judge elements exactly the same 
thing and the possession element,

38
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,330
while it's slightly different,
but it's not that different,

39
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,450
you know,
so,

40
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,510
but it's a strange thing because the 
visual image,

41
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,610
general digital images that the 
feminine.

42
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,103
So it's a strange because I don't think 
the architectural structures were the 

43
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:30,130
same men and women.
So part of it,

44
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,940
the way I've tried to figure this out,
it's like the sun is the sun,

45
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,490
the like the mail,
not the shining sun,

46
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,324
although it's also that it's like,
but women obviously have an element of 

47
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,540
them that can be heroic and adversarial,
just like man.

48
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,033
But then in women that's complicated 
because the other primary elements of 

49
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:51,710
their Ba is the maternal feminine 
element.

50
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,993
And so.
But that's complicated because women or 

51
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:57,890
men can also be quite maternal.
Like for mammals,

52
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,873
predatory mammals,
mandarin unbelievably nurturing and 

53
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:04,330
feminine.
No grizzly bears.

54
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:06,070
We just eat our own problems.
Know.

55
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,153
So men are,
they're quite feminine as well as being 

56
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:10,990
masculine.
So I kinda think of it this way.

57
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:11,824
It's like if you're thinking about what 
your archetipal personality structure 

58
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:15,880
is,
it's for men.

59
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,930
The hero is at the forefront and the 
mother,

60
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:22,090
the feminine modern,
restorative behind that.

61
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,960
And for women it's reversed.
The Feminine Mother is sort of forefront

62
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:28,750
and the heroes behind that.
But both of the archetypes are,

63
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,390
are,
are operative.

64
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,420
So,
so you can think about that.

65
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,980
You can see,
see what you make of it.

66
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,093
But

67
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,270
you know,
because he might say,

68
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,380
well why would women isn't reasonable to
presuppose that for women,

69
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,320
the feminine represents the unknown just
like he does for man.

70
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,323
And I don't think it is just like it is 
for men because I think for women 

71
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,723
there's an element of the patriarchal 
structure that's more unknown Mathius 

72
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,370
for men,
you know,

73
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,720
and I think you see the reaction to that
in part,

74
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,440
you see the reaction to that in the 
feminist movement because the patriarchy

75
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:07,330
is like the tyrannical father,
you know,

76
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,343
and the patriarchy exists,
but it's not the tyrannical father is 

77
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:15,280
not the entire substrate of culture.
It's just ridiculous.

78
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:18,600
But I think because women are,
you know,

79
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,240
in some sense they're outsiders to the 
male dominance hierarchy,

80
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,453
that

81
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,343
the male dominance hierarchy is more 
contaminated by the unknown for women 

82
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:30,614
than it is for math.
And I think it's more likely to be 

83
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:34,370
interpreted as the tyrannical father 
because of that.

84
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,773
So anyways,
I can't exactly sorted out because he 

85
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,000
ended up with nest problems,
you know,

86
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:44,590
so in so far as your primary mode of 
being as feminine,

87
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,910
then your secondary motor being as 
masculine,

88
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,193
you're gonna have all the 
characteristics of something masculine 

89
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:51,560
and all the characteristics of something
feminine,

90
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:54,140
but the manner in which they manifest 
themselves,

91
00:04:54,141 --> 00:04:54,974
that's going to be different and I just 
can't sort that out too damn 

92
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:57,584
complicated.
Plus I think that that is what we're 

93
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,670
sorting out right now in our culture.
You know,

94
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,260
ever since women got the ability to 
control their reproductive function,

95
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,333
which was probably at least in part a 
consequence of an aide prior 

96
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,220
psychological transformation,
right?

97
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,450
Because you could say,
well the pill for women,

98
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,583
but then you could say,
well what was the precondition for 

99
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:21,320
creating a society in which the person 
who invented the pill didn't get killed.

100
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,210
You know,
because the Catholic church,

101
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:24,500
for example,
was not happy.

102
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:26,060
We build was invented.
Seriously,

103
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:26,894
not happy and no wonder know sold.
Obviously there had to be some shifting 

104
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,353
in the underlying conceptual landscape 
in relationship to the relationship 

105
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:36,674
between men and women.
For that invention to even have come 

106
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,820
out,
you know,

107
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,470
I think you can really see that starting
know if you read the classic Russian and

108
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:45,304
all those,
you can see that push towards equality 

109
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:51,270
to characterize women was really alive 
and well in 19th century Russia.

110
00:05:51,271 --> 00:05:54,260
I'm on mirrors to call aristocracy,
so you know like it,

111
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,183
it has a pretty lengthy history that's 
associated a wiping of gender 

112
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,560
differences across western countries.

113
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,700
Meet the,
the,

114
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,593
the waning.
You mean that widening of personality 

115
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:07,154
differences?
So big five differences are wider and 

116
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:13,940
more here and countries and depression 
of incidents.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,550
I don't know.
I don't know how to answer that.

118
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:17,384
Exactly.
So the point is that if you look at 

119
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:22,290
personality differences between men and 
women in the modern world,

120
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:25,550
the most egalitarian cultures have the 
biggest personality differences,

121
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,384
the gender,
and so the technical reason for that is 

122
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:29,744
all the environmental variability has 
been eliminated and so all that's left 

123
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:33,284
is genetic variability and there,
and that's not masked in some sense by 

124
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:39,710
the environmental variability.
So it's powerful and profound,

125
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,850
but it definitely shows that there's a 
lot of powerful genetic variability.

126
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,120
Definitely it's powerful evidence for 
that,

127
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,070
you know,
but it also could be,

128
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,523
it could easily be that didn't 
necessarily fit what you're aiming for 

129
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:58,010
in it.
The galitary in society is the right for

130
00:06:58,011 --> 00:07:00,830
everyone to be different in their own 
way,

131
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,090
whatever that happens to be,
you know,

132
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,970
and obviously that's going to be a 
limited,

133
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:06,140
right to some degree.

134
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,153
So any galitary and society wouldn't 
necessarily eradicate personality 

135
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:10,994
differences.
That would be a bloody totalitarian 

136
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:14,270
societies.
Like get rid of all the differences.

137
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,733
Well,
to the degree that you're a female and 

138
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,910
whatever the hell that means 
fundamentally,

139
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:22,490
and I mail,
if we have to be the same,

140
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,430
then that's going to be a function of 
increased tense.

141
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,110
What would you call control on the part 
of the state?

142
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,150
You know,
to the degree that that's intrinsic,

143
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,100
we don't know what,
how much of it's intrinsic.

144
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:37,970
I would be very hesitant to say not.
I mean let's,

145
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:39,470
let's be real about this

146
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:46,060
additionally complicated because 
architects like they're universally,

147
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:52,500
but you understand both the female and 
the male president.

148
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,200
I know you understand and as personality
traits,

149
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,413
the masculine stereotypical traits and 
feminine stereotypical traits across 

150
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,290
genders,
but people,

151
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,740
any person have you done there can be 
this as much or whatever,

152
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,350
like they're not opposites,
so wondering if it's complicated because

153
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:17,351
any individual person that is manifested
in parts of both at once in some.

154
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,933
No,
it's definitely.

155
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,483
It's definitely complicated,
but it's also a prerequisite for 

156
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:26,050
longterm relationships between men and 
women.

157
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:29,200
Right.
If we weren't a lot the same or at least

158
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:30,034
capable of being the same,
then we will be able to understand each 

159
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:33,990
other at all.
I mean,

160
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:34,731
he didn't.
I don't know if we,

161
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:35,564
if we do what we do,
we do more than other creatures that 

162
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,820
have our complexity,
that's for sure.

163
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,580
So yeah,
and you know,

164
00:08:41,581 --> 00:08:42,414
it's certainly the case that if you look
at a given individual and you look at 

165
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:49,330
the variability of their personality,
Leighton's behavior,

166
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:50,943
the variability within a person is 
generally greater than the average 

167
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:57,240
variability within the population.
So you know,

168
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,130
human beings,
if you're an extrovert,

169
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:03,000
you can be extremely introverted.
Like there's not very many extroverts at

170
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:03,834
a funeral.
Now the noisiest people at a funeral 

171
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,823
will be the extroverts,
but there are going to be hard to be 

172
00:09:09,501 --> 00:09:10,750
noisy at all,
you know,

173
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,670
and an introvert can find themselves in 
the situation where they can't shut up.

174
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,863
You know?
So there's a lot of inter individual 

175
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:20,070
variability.
I actually think that one of the indexes

176
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:20,963
of psychological health is the 
maximizations of individual variability 

177
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,290
because you should be able to be 
extremely compassionate,

178
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,980
for example,
when you're dealing with a sick baby and

179
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,220
extremely uncompassionate when you're 
dealing with someone who's,

180
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,173
you know,
using their illness as an excuse not to 

181
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:40,800
pull their own weight,
but you need both of those.

182
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:41,930
Right?
And you know,

183
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,773
you'll end up with an average point as a
consequence of your genetic structure 

184
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:49,320
and maybe your,
your socialization and sort of up to you

185
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,154
to widen yourself all across the full 
spectrum so that you can call and those 

186
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:54,594
abilities when it's necessary.
I think that's part of what 

187
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:59,160
differentiation as a person actually 
means.

188
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,303
You know,
because you,

189
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,183
you come to be able to do more things 
and so you can match yourself much more 

190
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:08,460
carefully to the immediate demands of 
the situation.

191
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,500
So yeah,
we have the questions.

192
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,380
Okay.
So the,

193
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,770
the assemble for,
for uh,

194
00:10:20,771 --> 00:10:25,620
normally the feminine differentiates 
into the negative feminine,

195
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,483
the positive feminine part of the issue 
is how do you get more of the positive 

196
00:10:28,691 --> 00:10:30,700
and keep the negative that day.
And you know,

197
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,563
that's,
that's a question that people have to 

198
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:33,364
ask themselves at the personal,
the individual at that level of the 

199
00:10:35,711 --> 00:10:39,280
individual interaction with other people
and with themselves.

200
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,840
But then it also works as a 
representation of the unknown and nature

201
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:44,674
as such.
It's because in some ways those are the 

202
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,800
same thing.
So that's,

203
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,390
you know,
that's a differentiation.

204
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,643
So,
so this is the relationship between the 

205
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:56,674
hero archetype in the feminist.
So what you have here is the chaos 

206
00:10:58,931 --> 00:11:01,300
dragon differentiating itself into the 
feminine,

207
00:11:01,301 --> 00:11:03,490
which is half positive,
half negative,

208
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,563
and the feminine.
They're being manifested in the form of 

209
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,683
the Virgin Mary with Christ on her lap.
You saw at the same representation when 

210
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:12,154
we were looking at Isis and horace,
and what's really quite cool about that 

211
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:16,480
as you see,
she's surrounded by this,

212
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,120
this matador law,
this,

213
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,043
this,
uh,

214
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,460
you know,
almond shaped

215
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,003
opening fundamentally.
And you see this as something that 

216
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:29,650
renaissance artists get a lot.
You see along the edges of the Mandurah,

217
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,523
there's all these little baby hits that 
are popping up with wings on them and 

218
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:34,530
those are called Pootie,
you know,

219
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,620
and it's very common that when you see 
representations of married with,

220
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,483
with,
with the cosmos sort of billowing out 

221
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:42,274
behind her because that's what you see.
It's like a whole into time and space 

222
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:47,860
that there's all these potential beings 
that are surrounding,

223
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:48,843
you know,
it's these little baby heads with 

224
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:51,311
weight.
It's like,

225
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,750
what the hell are they?
Well,

226
00:11:52,751 --> 00:11:54,520
what this thing,
you know,

227
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:55,354
it's so strange.
I went to a museum in New York where a 

228
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:00,300
number of renaissance paintings of this 
type were,

229
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,100
were arrayed in this one room.
It's like a rude word,

230
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,410
affiliate donors,
Nazy Room.

231
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,483
And there are people from all over the 
world and they're looking at these damn 

232
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,000
paintings.

233
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,270
And they say,
you know this,

234
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,104
it's like it's married and she's sitting
on the moon and there's a bunch of like 

235
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,450
winged baby heads around like,
what the hell's that all about?

236
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,850
Everybody's looking at it like,
wow,

237
00:12:19,851 --> 00:12:21,550
you know,
there's really something to this.

238
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:23,830
And it's like you've kept them on the 
shoulder and you say,

239
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,753
well,
why did you travel from like Cincinnati 

240
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:27,754
to come to this museum to look like this
woman who he don't even believe in 

241
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,840
sitting on the Chris Moon surrounded by 
baby hands?

242
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,710
They don't know.
I have no idea why they're there.

243
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,500
They're fascinated by the painting.
Right?

244
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,750
Fascinating.
If life interrupts a reasons,

245
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:44,584
but you know,
you don't even notice how absurd it is 

246
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:49,480
until you take the picture of a bit.
What the hell are these things,

247
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,770
these Pootie,
you know,

248
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:55,180
I think what they are essential beings.
That's the representation.

249
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:00,180
So Mary represents the feminine domain 
from which potential being emergence,

250
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,583
which is perfectly reasonable way of 
characterizing defendant in 

251
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:05,224
architecture.
You know what are the pictures I will 

252
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:08,314
show you,
which I just love is married to another 

253
00:13:10,031 --> 00:13:10,864
representation of Mary and she's got 
Christ in her hands and she's holding 

254
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:16,300
them up to the left and her foot.
Your foot is gone.

255
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,143
A snake's head,
which I think is so cool because if you 

256
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:19,924
look at that picture and you strip away 
the Judeo Christian presuppositions and 

257
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:26,170
you just look at it like a damn 
biologist,

258
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:26,981
you think,
well,

259
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:29,380
of course that's what she's doing.
You know?

260
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,303
It's like Mama chimp keeps the damn 
infant away from the snakes and that's 

261
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:38,050
the archetype and of course it's the 
archetype because that is what you do.

262
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,063
That's what you do when you're a mother,
especially if you have nice edible 

263
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,043
babies that snakes like to eat and that 
is certainly something that 

264
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,350
characterizes us in our evolutionary 
past.

265
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,060
So it's no wonder it's a divine 
archetype,

266
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,700
you know?
Of course it is.

267
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,530
How could it not be the.
You might say,

268
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:54,740
well,
I don't believe in that.

269
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,583
It's like the hell.
Does that mean you don't believe in 

270
00:13:57,521 --> 00:13:58,580
that?
No,

271
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,463
I.
I can't even understand what that means 

272
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:02,860
anymore.
When I think about such things,

273
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:03,694
it's like there's,
you don't have an option about bleeding 

274
00:14:06,531 --> 00:14:08,890
and that it's just the fundamental 
nature of reality,

275
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,013
you know?
Is that the mother of God and it's what 

276
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:13,354
you mean?
It all depends on how much divinity is 

277
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,400
embodied in your child and believe me,
once you have that child,

278
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,051
you're going to think,
hey,

279
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:22,930
there's a pretty big chunk of divinity 
and did that child.

280
00:14:22,931 --> 00:14:24,540
No one knows.
Makes to get that.

281
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,070
I'm going to keep it away from predators
and you know,

282
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,570
evil doers and try to raise it into the 
best possible things.

283
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,920
Like you may say,
you don't believe that.

284
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,853
It was like,
what the hell do you know in so far as 

285
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:36,364
you're a good mother,
you'll be acting that I was going mad 

286
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,530
and I'm not going to say that's wrong 
because I actually think it's right.

287
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,993
I think the child is a container of the 
divine and that your job as a mother is 

288
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:46,943
to allow that child can facilitate the 
development of that child into the 

289
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,124
mythological.
That's what you're up to and that's a 

290
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:54,674
holy mission in so far as you could use 
that word to describe anything and I 

291
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,390
failed to see how that is not real.
I think it's the most real thing.

292
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,003
So when I also think the degree to which
you're going to be able to do that as a 

293
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,040
monitoring will be the most rewarding 
thing you'll ever do in your life.

294
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,323
And you'll figure that out.
It's a powerful thing and your whole 

295
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:18,230
life can change this completely.
Once you have your own child,

296
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,150
it's like they're not like other 
children.

297
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,253
They're your old shot.
It's like they're the most important 

298
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:26,660
thing in the world right then and from 
then on,

299
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,360
if you're healthy,
it's like your priorities shift.

300
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,760
It's not about you anymore.
And that's a sacrifice,

301
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:33,620
you know,
it's a real sacrifice.

302
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:37,010
The sacrifice that women are called on 
for me and itself,

303
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,720
two major sacrifice.
Okay?

304
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:42,441
So the,
you know,

305
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,160
the mother gives birth to the hero.
Okay?

306
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:44,994
That's Hercules.
It's not priced as Hercules and this 

307
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:48,680
particular representation,
and she's,

308
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,350
I love this representation is.
It's so cool.

309
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,273
So Hercules',
he's out there in the darkness on the 

310
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,800
water,
so it's the water retail,

311
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,330
so that's where he's situated themselves
voluntarily and he's,

312
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,213
is he in this container now?
It's a good thing you can take about 

313
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,973
that as a maternal container or even 
think about it as cultural protection 

314
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,143
doesn't really matter.
And then he's got this clock and if you 

315
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:13,520
look on the cloud,
but it's got these weird bumps on it.

316
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,920
But if you look at the bottom,
what do you understand this?

317
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:17,750
Those aren't farms.
Those are our eyes.

318
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,310
So He's just like,
Marta,

319
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,630
he's got this club and what's the club?
It's like attention.

320
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,793
That's it.

321
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,873
You know what,
if you're going to clump something you 

322
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,040
had to us to pay attention to it.
Maybe it's like a rampaging light.

323
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,450
And then if you turn away from it,
well it's gonna eat you.

324
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,060
So the clubs useless without the 
attention.

325
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,080
But you know the picture says club,
which is a weapon.

326
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,670
A weapon is A.
Metta is a form of mental attention,

327
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,360
or sorry,
I've bought my reverse.

328
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,943
Attention is a better weapon.
It's the ultimate weapon against the 

329
00:16:50,011 --> 00:16:51,280
unknown.
And so there's,

330
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,123
her has got his eyes wide open,
he's peering out into the darkness he's 

331
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:58,890
got this lion had because he killed a 
lion and you know,

332
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,350
men used to do that,
you know,

333
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,610
and they were shepherds out in the 
desert in the Middle East.

334
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,580
One of the things they had to do was 
kill a lion with a spear.

335
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,443
It's like,

336
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,570
that's really worth thinking about,
man,

337
00:17:12,571 --> 00:17:13,404
that's hard to do that.
That would be very hard to be very 

338
00:17:15,421 --> 00:17:17,370
friendly to do that.
And so,

339
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:18,204
but men used to do that.
So that's really something to think 

340
00:17:20,251 --> 00:17:21,220
about.
Anyways,

341
00:17:21,221 --> 00:17:24,810
so he's got this light into going into 
and he's King of the beasts,

342
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:27,360
roughly speaking.
So it represents the thing that's at the

343
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:28,194
top of the dominance hierarchy.
You want to know that because otherwise 

344
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:31,044
he couldn't have understood the lion 
king and the lion is a solar beast 

345
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:35,810
because it's yellow golden word sounded.
You know,

346
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,663
what's a daylight creature?
It's out there on the belt where 

347
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,813
everything's son.
So it's associated with the Sonnet 

348
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,710
illumination and enlightenment.
And so it's like lions,

349
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:50,710
son Sutton with ice goes to conquer the 
unknown.

350
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,290
That's what the mother does,
if she raises the proper son,

351
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,740
so I know she's also doing that for the 
door,

352
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,603
but again,
that's complicated because women are 

353
00:17:57,931 --> 00:17:58,764
complicated and their role is very,
very complex and so to some degree 

354
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:05,220
they're the hero,
but to some degree they're the mother of

355
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:07,650
the hero and those are,
I would say,

356
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,060
I don't know.
I don't know how to,

357
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,120
how to configure that.

358
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,530
It's you could say,

359
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,960
okay,

360
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,183
you,
you could say that in some sense of a 

361
00:18:28,871 --> 00:18:33,871
conscious mind or gives up her own 
individual heroism as a sacrifice to the

362
00:18:35,171 --> 00:18:36,004
potential hero is a Mumford children's 
and that's worth thinking about because 

363
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:43,240
my guess is that for most of you,
your mother did that,

364
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,870
you know,
now you want to,

365
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:47,480
you know,
my wife had a three months about what do

366
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:50,050
you want her great grandmother's shoes.
Her grandmother shoots.

367
00:18:50,051 --> 00:18:52,120
She really liked her grandmother,
a very feminine person,

368
00:18:52,121 --> 00:18:54,130
you know,
like cookie making,

369
00:18:54,131 --> 00:18:57,060
Apple Pie,
they shadow play grandmother,

370
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:57,894
you know,
she had people in the old folks home 

371
00:19:01,151 --> 00:19:04,060
even when she was 80 and she was really 
cheerful and tough,

372
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,220
but she's a great person.
I really liked her,

373
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,623
but when my wife dream diversity driven,
she was trying on her shoes and the 

374
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:12,550
shoes were too small,
you know,

375
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,400
and that was very interesting because it
seemed to indicate to me,

376
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,220
and she loved your grandmother now 
there's no doubt about that,

377
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,780
that role,
despite her grandmother having fulfilled

378
00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:25,930
us so well it wasn't announced and you 
know,

379
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:26,764
women have kind of decided that and 
maybe that's for the best because now 

380
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,950
there's all these smart women's running 
around doing useful things and you know,

381
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,060
that's probably good,
but exactly how to sort that out.

382
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,490
You figure it out.

383
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,580
So what time is it.
