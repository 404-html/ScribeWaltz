1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,620
When you love someone,
you love them,

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:07,663
not only despite their fragile it,
but also because of it wouldn't be who 

3
00:00:11,841 --> 00:00:16,520
they were if they weren't fragile and 
limited in their particular way.

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,170
When you have a sick kid,
it's like,

5
00:00:18,171 --> 00:00:21,020
oh my God,
how can the world be constituted so that

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,690
a child can unfairly suffered in this 
map?

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,823
You can't have them being vulnerable and
cute and interesting and small and 

8
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:31,610
needing care,
but striving to develop and grow without

9
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:35,120
them also being prone to pain and 
destruction and vulnerability,

10
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:37,430
and then what do you do?
Teach them to be strong.

11
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,040
That's what you do.
You don't get rid of the vulnerability.

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,040
It teach them to be strong.
You don't protect your children.

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,630
In fact,
you do.

14
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,463
You do the opposite.
You expose them to the world as much as 

15
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:49,280
you possibly can and you make them 
strong.

16
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,560
That's the best antidote to their 
vulnerability.

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,590
The first noble truth of Buddhism life 
is suffering.

18
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,783
This is true and it's worse than that 
because it's suffering contaminated by 

19
00:00:58,941 --> 00:01:01,220
malevolence and so that's very 
pessimistic,

20
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,430
but the optimistic part is that you are 
so damn tough.

21
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,050
You can actually know that we deal with 
that,

22
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,080
oh,
well that's a horrible situation,

23
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,390
but it turns out that I'm armed for the 
task.

24
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,580
That's.
That's a great thing for people.

25
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,590
I think the fact that we're armed for 
the task is even more true than the fact

26
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:21,424
that life is catastrophe contaminated by
malevolence were stronger than things 

27
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,074
are terrible.
Do believe it's the case because I've 

28
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:28,984
watched people do very difficult things 
like people who work in palliative care 

29
00:01:31,451 --> 00:01:32,284
wards,
so all they're ever dealing with his 

30
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:35,110
pain and death,
right,

31
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:37,660
and they can do it and get up in the 
morning.

32
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,850
They go to work and they take care of 
those people.

33
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,300
They lose people on a weekly basis and 
yet they can do it,

34
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,553
and what that shows is that if you turn 
around and you confront the suffering 

35
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:51,490
voluntarily who find out that you are 
way tougher than you think.

36
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,680
It's not that life is better than you 
think.

37
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,830
Life isn't as harsh as you think.
It might even be worse,

38
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,880
but you are way tougher than you think.
If you turn around and confronted,

39
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,480
it's a very good thing to know and it's 
not naive optimism.

40
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,430
It's a very different thing.
It's like,

41
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:07,960
no,
things are terrible.

42
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,330
They are brutal and you are so damn 
tough.

43
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,440
You can't believe it.
