1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,240
About a month ago,
I had my funding for my ongoing research

2
00:00:04,241 --> 00:00:08,950
projects refused by the federal 
government,

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,560
a social sciences and Humanities 
Research Council,

4
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:12,394
and as an event from rebel media decided
to host on Indiegogo crowdfunding 

5
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:22,150
campaign to replace it,
which was very good of him.

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,463
Um,
so thank you to Ezra and also to itn 

7
00:00:25,781 --> 00:00:30,060
deal board who helped out a lot and to 
Hannah Vander Coi for managing it.

8
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:32,500
It was extraordinarily helpful.
Um,

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,573
we raised about $80,000 the first day 
and then since then we've raised about 

10
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:40,180
$180,000,
2,500 backers.

11
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,400
The original grant proposal was for 
$300,000 across five years.

12
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:47,440
So that's basically three years of 
funding.

13
00:00:47,441 --> 00:00:49,810
So I'm extraordinarily impressed by 
that.

14
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:53,590
And also very thankful for all of you 
who donated.

15
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,840
Um,
thank you very much.

16
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:56,674
I've put together this video with two of
my graduate students whose academic 

17
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:01,144
careers will be supported as a 
consequence of this funding so that you 

18
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,314
know a little bit more about them and 
also about what it is that you helped 

19
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:13,740
out with the third,
Christine Brophy is working on political

20
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:14,710
correctness.

21
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,780
And the relationship between personality
and political belief as well as on the,

22
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,050
on the biological basis of the big five 
personality traits.

23
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,410
She couldn't contribute to the video 
for,

24
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,813
for various reasons this time round,
although she did a lengthy interview 

25
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:32,810
with ray rebel media that you can catch 
on a,

26
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,840
on social justice issues and,
and their basis in personality.

27
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,070
And so,
uh,

28
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,993
after this very brief introduction,
I'm going to let the students speak for 

29
00:01:43,661 --> 00:01:44,494
each for five minutes.
They've prepared a video telling you 

30
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:48,820
what they're up to.
So anyways,

31
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:49,654
thanks very much.
We have one day left of the funding 

32
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:52,204
campaign runs for 24 hours.
So this is the final update in all 

33
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:58,280
likelihood by March.

34
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,790
Hi everyone.
My name's John Tenant.

35
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,990
I'm a first year master's student in Dr 
Peterson's lab.

36
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,590
My research interests include technology
for cognitive enhancement,

37
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,200
personality development,
and music cognition.

38
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,933
My background is a little bit different.
I did my bachelor's degree in music 

39
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:17,564
theory and my undergraduate research 
focused on mathematical models of 

40
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,703
musical harmony and timber.
This year I'll be designing and testing 

41
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:27,830
a biofeedback system for increasing 
people's ability to flow,

42
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,800
self regulate and get in tune with one 
another.

43
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm using a variety of sensors to 
measure things like heart rate,

44
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,040
breathing,
arousal,

45
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,323
and brainwaves.
How are we turning these signals into 

46
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:41,174
quads?
I'm musical stimuli to give people 

47
00:02:42,561 --> 00:02:44,750
feedback about their body and mind in 
real time.

48
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,363
They should be able to help people 
better understand themselves and 

49
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:51,380
regulate their stress and emotions if 
used in pairs,

50
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:53,780
they might even be able to help people 
sync up with one another,

51
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,033
perhaps fostering empathy and helping 
them get into a kind of interpersonal 

52
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,144
flow state.

53
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,530
I have a huge personal interest in 
combining music,

54
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,393
psychology and technology.
In my undergraduate work with Dr 

55
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,770
Peterson,
I tackled theoretical issues surrounding

56
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,700
visual representations of music.
While working on that project,

57
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:13,534
I developed a method for making 
important musical parameters such as 

58
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,320
harmony,
pitch,

59
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,680
rhythm and tamber accessible to our 
visual system.

60
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,323
I created two software.
Music visualizer is based on these 

61
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:24,874
principles.
I found these techniques also translate 

62
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:31,600
well to other applications such as the 
visualization of biological data.

63
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,050
If you'd like to see the music 
visualizes,

64
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:37,540
I developed or read about the principles
behind them,

65
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,900
you can check out my 
website@JohnMatthewtenant.com.

66
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,770
There you can also find my undergraduate
paper on math and musical harmony.

67
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,710
In my personality research this year,
I looked at female mate preference in an

68
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:51,544
online study.
Women read the profile of a fictional 

69
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:54,244
man and size picture.
Women then rated the man's 

70
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,670
attractiveness and personality.

71
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,163
They also answered questions about their
own personality and completed an Iq 

72
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:03,910
test.
From this data,

73
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:07,270
we were able to build a model of what 
kinds of personalities are attractive to

74
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:08,920
who.
On average,

75
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,500
women tended to prefer men who are 
conscientious,

76
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,420
extroverted,
agreeable,

77
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,583
emotionally stable,
and open to experience higher Iq 

78
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:19,570
participants.
However,

79
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,790
where the men is much less attractive on
average,

80
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,720
and they were less moved by those 
traditionally attractive characteristics

81
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:28,000
like extroversion,
conscientiousness,

82
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,300
emotional stability for more intelligent
women.

83
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,583
The only things that made a significant 
difference where creativity and 

84
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:35,284
plaintiffs,
which are sub aspects of openness and 

85
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:37,834
agreeableness,
we think creativity might be especially 

86
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:44,440
attractive because it indicates 
competence in unfamiliar situations.

87
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,263
The attraction to agreeableness might be
due to a desire for a partner who will 

88
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:49,804
share resources and care for children
in my upcoming personality research and 

89
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,894
developing a new method for 
investigating the structure of 

90
00:04:57,451 --> 00:04:58,284
personality.

91
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,853
In traditional personality studies,
participants rate themselves on every 

92
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:04,990
item.
This limits the number of items that can

93
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:07,780
be analyzed simultaneously.
Instead,

94
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:08,883
we're going to use collaborative ratings
of fictional characters and public 

95
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,244
figures.
Multiple people will provide ratings of 

96
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:15,274
the targets personality,
and we can build up a complete 

97
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:18,034
description from the multiple raters.
This will allow us to investigate the 

98
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:25,000
personality data contained inside larger
sets of descriptors.

99
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,753
This will help us rapidly expand the 
vocabulary of words we can use to 

100
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:30,064
measure personality,
which should increase the precision of 

101
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,464
our models.
The first study to use this method will 

102
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:35,254
attempt to integrate positive and 
negative person descriptors with our 

103
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:38,734
existing personality models.
This is important because when the 

104
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,700
original scales were devised,
researchers purposely omitted words like

105
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,010
evil,
untrustworthy wise and admirable,

106
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,043
but adding these words to our models of 
personality will be able to further 

107
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:55,900
explore the virtues and vices associated
with personality dimensions.

108
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,750
We might also be able to pick up on new 
effects and correlations.

109
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,330
This can be especially useful in the 
labs,

110
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:05,540
ongoing research into the personality 
underpinnings of political belief,

111
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,810
so I'd like to thank everyone for 
supporting our research.

112
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,410
It makes a really big difference,
especially to us the graduate students.

113
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,560
If you're interest in any of my work,
I'd love to hear from you.

114
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,340
You can also check out my site at John 
Matthew Tenon Dot com.

115
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,580
I have demos and papers posted there.
Thanks for watching.

116
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,170
My name is victor swift and I'm a phd 
student in Jordan Peterson's lab.

117
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,010
I joined the lab in 2013 as a master's 
student,

118
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,203
primarily researching how mental health 
is shaped by the ways in which people 

119
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:37,700
relate to their own descriptions of the 
world.

120
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,643
Today,
my overall research investigates the 

121
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:43,460
nature of the big five personality 
traits.

122
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,390
The big five represent distinct patterns
of feeling,

123
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,080
thinking,
and acting that are shared by all of us.

124
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,960
Humans and higher primates seem to 
possess five distinct dispositions,

125
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,153
hence the name openness,
a tendency to seek novel ideas and 

126
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:02,984
experiences.
Neuroticism tendency to seek certainty 

127
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,620
and experience negative emotions,
extroversion,

128
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,730
a tendency to seek attention and 
experience positive emotions,

129
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,313
agreeableness,
a tendency to seek social harmony 

130
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,840
through politeness and compassion,
and finally,

131
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,760
conscientiousness is a tendency to 
adhere to standards and goals by working

132
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:26,594
hard and staying organized.
This final trade has been the focus of 

133
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:33,230
my research for reasons that I will 
explain shortly.

134
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,773
Every person has these five traits to 
some degree and these traits remained 

135
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,890
relatively stable throughout adulthood.
As such,

136
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,053
the big five traits are important to 
both industry and academia because they 

137
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:52,010
can be used to reliably capture who a 
person is.

138
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,970
Now,
we are confident that the big five model

139
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:56,804
represents a real and meaningful 
psychological construct because it has 

140
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,980
been arrived at through several 
independent methodologies.

141
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,683
However,
we do not yet know why human 

142
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:09,950
dispositions cluster into these five 
traits,

143
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,560
nor do we know how to ascertain big five
traits without directly asking people to

144
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:19,280
introspect about themselves.
This is where my research comes in.

145
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,530
For the past three years,
I've been investigating how the big five

146
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:27,590
traits can be detected without self 
report.

147
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,503
This effort has taken many forms which I
will continue to pursue throughout the 

148
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:35,480
course of my phd.
For instance,

149
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,823
I've been investigating whether the big 
five traits map onto differences in 

150
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:45,350
fundamental cognitive processes such as 
attention thus far.

151
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,693
I have found support for the idea that 
conscientious people are remarkably 

152
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:54,200
better at deliberately attending to 
specific features under distractions.

153
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,093
Well,
people who score high on openness are 

154
00:08:57,961 --> 00:09:01,920
notably flexible at attending to 
changing attentional demands.

155
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,403
This research suggests that the big five
traits may have a basis in fundamental 

156
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,173
cognitive processes,
and this may lead to the development of 

157
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:13,164
personality screening measures that have
a basis in part on cognitive 

158
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:21,480
performance.
I've also been investigating whether the

159
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:22,314
big five traits reveal themselves in 
motivational reactions to positive and 

160
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:30,570
negative feedback on a variety of tasks.
So far,

161
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,640
this line of research has revealed that 
conscientious and neurotic people can be

162
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:39,180
provoked to work harder by using 
negative feedback.

163
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,733
However,
this effect only emerges when the task 

164
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:46,080
is somewhat enjoyable and the effect is 
first.

165
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,073
If the task is frustrating.
This line of research suggests that the 

166
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:55,470
big five may have a basis in more 
fundamental motivational tendencies,

167
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:56,843
and this may lead to the development of 
a motivational intervention that's 

168
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:02,460
tailored to specific personality 
profiles.

169
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,770
What am I most promising?
Research projects concerns the detection

170
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:08,604
of personality through language use.
This research is founded on the 

171
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:12,834
presupposition that character can be 
revealed through the words that 

172
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:16,344
individuals tend to use this ideas 
intuitive when we think about simple 

173
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:24,060
dispositions such as pessimism and 
optimism.

174
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,733
For example,
we would expect an optimist to use a 

175
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:30,480
disproportionate amount of positive 
words.

176
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,153
However,
it was unclear as to whether this would 

177
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:37,710
extend to complex dispositions such as 
conscientiousness,

178
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,300
which again represents a tendency to 
work hard and stay organized.

179
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,980
This disposition does not clearly map 
onto word choice,

180
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,323
so to test our hypothesis,
we generated a list of more than a 

181
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,063
thousand adjectives that are 
theoretically relevant to conscientious 

182
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:55,584
people.
These words included things such as 

183
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,790
methodical,
persistent,

184
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,043
and resourceful.
We then acquired a variety of writing 

185
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:05,094
samples from different groups of people.
These writing samples included 

186
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,340
recollections of positive memories,
negative memories,

187
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,790
ordinary experiences,
as well as stream of thought essays.

188
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,200
And even facebook statuses across all of
these samples,

189
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,423
we found highly conscientious people to 
use a disproportionate amount of 

190
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:27,180
conscientious related adjectives.
Not only that,

191
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,560
but we also found that the use of these 
adjectives predicts the same outcomes as

192
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:35,790
conscientiousness itself,
including increased income and increased

193
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:36,624
passion for work that we have 
demonstrated that it is possible to 

194
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:41,514
identify complex personality traits from
many different language samples easily 

195
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,703
and reliably.
We started with conscientiousness loan 

196
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,870
because of its clear real world 
applications.

197
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,943
Many of our most valued social,
organizational and individual outcomes 

198
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:01,990
are determined by conscientiousness.
People who possess this trait enrich our

199
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:06,010
communities by exercising social 
responsibility and relational fidelity.

200
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,563
As top performers at work in school,
conscientious people drive up the 

201
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:13,420
productivity of our organizations and 
the grades in our classrooms.

202
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,340
By demonstrating that conscientiousness 
can be detected through natural language

203
00:12:18,341 --> 00:12:19,174
use.
We have opened the door to a new 

204
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:23,830
approach for detecting a highly 
desirable personality traits.

205
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:29,790
The trait that many people lie about 
precisely due to its societal value.

206
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,433
Am I coming years in the Peterson lab?
I plan to develop a personality 

207
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:38,710
measurement battery based on these 
natural language findings.

208
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,503
The development of this battery will 
require more research into the language 

209
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:46,060
production tendencies associated with 
conscientiousness,

210
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,343
as well as an extension of this 
methodology to other big five 

211
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:50,524
personality traits taken together with 
my research and attention and 

212
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:54,754
motivation.
This work will help solidify what the 

213
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:57,994
big five represents and will afford the 
development of new tools for measuring 

214
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,790
and accommodating personality.
