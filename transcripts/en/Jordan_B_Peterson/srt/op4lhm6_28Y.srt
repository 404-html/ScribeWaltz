1
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,023
We just launched support Peterson,
research.com a crowdfunding campaign to 

2
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:10,870
pay for Professor Jordan Peterson is 
academic research.

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,303
And then the first 24 hours we raised 
more than an entire year's worth of 

4
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:18,970
research funding for them.
That's amazing.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,510
We did this because for the first time 
in his 20 year career,

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,613
the government agency that hands out 
research grants rejected his funding 

7
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:27,844
proposal,
which just coincidentally came after he 

8
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:32,770
made headlines for fighting against 
political correctness.

9
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:37,360
Well what a poetic victory.
We're getting him that funding after all

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,090
and now he's more independent than ever.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,430
Thanks very much for doing this.
Hey,

12
00:00:42,431 --> 00:00:45,590
it's working in an extraordinarily well.
I've been sitting here,

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,453
I'm down in Boston,
I'm going to do a talk at Harvard and a 

14
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,920
on political correctness and access 
compassion and free speech.

15
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:54,754
And I've been sitting here watching the 
numbers climb and I think there's more 

16
00:00:58,031 --> 00:01:00,880
than 1500 people who are supporting my 
research now.

17
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:01,714
And we've gone past for first year of 
funding already and I guess we're going 

18
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:07,150
to try it for the second year.
Um,

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,970
it's remarkable.
And,

20
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:12,490
uh,
well I,

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,873
I,
I don't know what to say except my 

22
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:19,450
graduate students are extraordinarily 
happy about this because it solves their

23
00:01:19,451 --> 00:01:22,240
problem.
Then we'll continue our research and can

24
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:24,410
just review that briefly.
Um,

25
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,443
the research is aimed first of all at 
improving the accuracy of the 

26
00:01:28,931 --> 00:01:31,960
measurement of personality and we've 
done some of some of that already.

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,470
Freaking the big five down into 10 sub 
components.

28
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:37,780
So for example,
we've looked at the relationship,

29
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,153
the subcomponents of conscientiousness 
and broken it down into industriousness 

30
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:44,500
and orderliness and associated with 
orderliness,

31
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:45,334
with disgust,
sensitivity and look its role in 

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,650
increasing the probability of 
conservative beliefs.

33
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:51,484
And we've looked at trade agreeableness 
and compassionate in particular and 

34
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:58,650
examine its relationship to politically 
correct leaf because it has,

35
00:01:58,651 --> 00:01:59,484
it seems to play a very strong role in 
determining a proclivity for people to 

36
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:04,594
adopt politically correct for leafs.
And we'll continue that and also 

37
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:09,844
continue doing the basic research into 
the development of programs like the 

38
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:14,380
self authoring suite.
Uh,

39
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,243
the future authoring portion of that has
already been demonstrated to raise 

40
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,200
college students,
grades five,

41
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:21,034
about 25% decrease the dropout.
And we've got 1200 high school students 

42
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:28,270
lined up to try a high school version of
that in the fall.

43
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,103
And we're very much looking forward to 
seeing if we can duplicate our success 

44
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:33,280
with that.
Anyways,

45
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:34,690
it's quite remarkable.
So,

46
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,603
um,
I'd like to thank everybody thoroughly 

47
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,950
for supporting this research and,
and supporting me.

48
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,010
I find it amazing that if this is 
possible even,

49
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,420
and so,
um,

50
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,090
our way we go I guess,
and once again thank you to,

51
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,330
to you and to everyone that's supporting
the research over to you as rough,

52
00:02:58,331 --> 00:02:59,164
we'll see how it goes over the next,
I guess we're gonna run this for a 

53
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:02,560
month.
We'll see how it goes over the month,

54
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,140
next month.
We've got lots of plans in the loud.

55
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,513
So,
um,

56
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,350
I think we can put the money to very 
good use and use.

57
00:03:09,351 --> 00:03:10,970
That will be,
what would you say?

58
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:11,804
It's not only scientifically valid,
but hopefully that will have a broad 

59
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:19,090
scale impact on practically speaking 
because as a clinical psychologist,

60
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:19,924
I like to conduct research that's going 
to be abroad practical benefit as well 

61
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:27,760
as theoretical and scientific utility.
So anyways,

62
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,050
thanks again already.

63
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,480
It is amazing and thank you to all of 
you.

64
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,420
All the net proceeds will be sent to 
Professor Peterson.

65
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,583
And remember the perks,
if you give $100 you'll receive a link 

66
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:40,974
to an exclusive video from him.
$250 get you an invitation to a 

67
00:03:44,611 --> 00:03:48,570
reception to meet him and his Grad 
students and a thousand dollar donor.

68
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,613
Well,
you'll actually get a bound copy of his 

69
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:54,150
research personally autographed.
So let's go forward.

70
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,163
Let's set our sights on the stretch goal
of funding the second year of his 

71
00:03:58,921 --> 00:03:59,754
recent,
remember it was a five year application 

72
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,220
that it was rejected.
So let's do what the politicians and the

73
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:10,221
bureaucrats won't visit.
