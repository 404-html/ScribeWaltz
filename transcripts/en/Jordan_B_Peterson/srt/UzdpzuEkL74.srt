1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,720
We're going to talk some more about
existentialism today

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:11,770
and I'm going to talk to you about a
couple of Swiss psychiatrists in swinger

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,810
and boss.
Just as a starting point.

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,410
Okay.

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,490
There are psychological viewpoint was
influenced to a large degree by a

6
00:00:21,491 --> 00:00:22,930
philosopher named heidegger.

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,573
Yeah.

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,060
And heidegger considered himself a
student of being and for heidegger that

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:36,190
the main mystery of the world was why,
why it existed and the the best way to

10
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:41,990
think about the phenomenal,
he was a phenomenologist.

11
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:46,850
And the best way to think about
phenomenology and existentialism is that

12
00:00:46,851 --> 00:00:51,851
phenomenology is the study of experience
as it's lived.

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,640
And then existentialism puts a twist on
that because existentialists assume that

14
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,040
being has implicitly moral dimension

15
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:06,623
and

16
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,460
the existentialists psychologists
presume that

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,770
pathology at least in part,
is a consequence of a disturbed

18
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,640
relationship,
a disturbed moral relationship with the

19
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:24,641
self and being.
It's very tricky thinking and it's not

20
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:30,350
often handled in personality courses
anymore,

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,780
but I think that's a big mistake.
The phenomenological element in

22
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:36,300
particular.
The one thing I really like about it is

23
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:41,301
that it's a really good counterpart to
modern materialistic viewpoint because

24
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:45,750
it puts consciousness at the center of
being,

25
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:50,751
instead of treating it as if it's
something that's a secondary phenomena

26
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:53,670
that emerges from something else.
And

27
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,940
okay,

28
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,490
our modern presuppositions,
especially the scientific

29
00:01:58,491 --> 00:02:02,180
presuppositions or what passed for
scientific presuppositions,

30
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,010
are generally extremely reductionist and
they assume that consciousness is in

31
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:11,780
some manner that's not yet been
determined,

32
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,130
I guess secondary biproduct of
fundamentally material processes,

33
00:02:16,131 --> 00:02:19,580
and it's a perfectly reasonable
hypothesis,

34
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:22,880
but I wouldn't say there's any real
evidence for it.

35
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,060
I mean,
it's,

36
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,060
it's hard to over state how mysterious
consciousness is as a phenomena.

37
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,703
Okay.

38
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,590
For heidegger,
consciousness was a mystery that was in

39
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:43,591
some sense equivalent to the mystery of
being and the way that the reason for

40
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:49,190
that was that he couldn't conceive of
existence without a soul,

41
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,240
without a subject.
So you can imagine if the world was

42
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:58,360
stripped of consciousness,
it's very difficult to describe what

43
00:02:58,361 --> 00:02:59,380
would be left.
I mean,

44
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:01,880
if you take a very straightforward
materialistic viewpoint,

45
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,350
you could make the presumption that if
everything that was conscious was

46
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,040
eradicated,
then things would be just the way they

47
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:09,970
are now.
But

48
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,313
that,

49
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,750
I think that's a shallow viewpoint
because consciousness is what gives

50
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,720
everything a perspective,
gives it a size and it gives it a

51
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:27,490
duration and it gives it colors and all
the qualities that we associate with

52
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:31,720
being and without that consciousness,
all that,

53
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,790
at least in comprehensible.
And then there are deeper problems that

54
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,670
are dealt with by people like John
Wheeler,

55
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:44,671
who's a quantum physicist,
who believes that consciousness is

56
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:49,711
necessarily is necessary for quantum
indeterminacy to resolve itself into

57
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:56,761
something that's concrete in actual so
wheeler and many physicists like him put

58
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:02,800
consciousness at the center of the
process that turns potential into

59
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:03,634
actuality.

60
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,010
Now,

61
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,440
at the same time,
these quantum ideas were being

62
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,430
developed.
These philosophical ideas and

63
00:04:13,431 --> 00:04:18,431
psychological ideas that I'm describing
are being developed and they provide

64
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:22,670
such a different take on the structure
of reality that

65
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,380
that I think they're indispensable.
I also think they're,

66
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,180
they're,
they're interesting in relationship in

67
00:04:30,181 --> 00:04:35,181
particular to piaget's thought because
the phenomenologists have a

68
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:38,660
constructivist element to their thinking
in that

69
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,080
they believe that consciousness plays a
constructive role in the establishment

70
00:04:45,081 --> 00:04:45,914
of being.

71
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,990
Okay,

72
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,120
so we're going to look at being,
so again,

73
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:53,850
the way to think about this is you've
got to flip your viewpoint in a sense is

74
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,870
you have to think about your experience
as reality and that everything that's

75
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,900
inside that experience,
so to speak as a subcomponent of that

76
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:07,010
reality instead of thinking of material
things as the reality and your

77
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:09,080
experience somehow emerging out of
those,

78
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,110
it's,
it's an inversion of what constitutes

79
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,470
the fundamental reality.
And so you could think about it in sense

80
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:21,100
as an intellectual exercise.
I mean most of the way that people think

81
00:05:22,431 --> 00:05:25,850
is predicated on some kind of implicit
set of axioms.

82
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,060
And if you changed the axioms,
you can also,

83
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,530
you can often shed light on reality in a
new and interesting way.

84
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,820
And so we're going to walk through the
phenomenological viewpoint and we're

85
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:42,470
going to see
why and how that might be interesting,

86
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,200
the phenomenological and existential
viewpoints.

87
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,560
And then I'm in the next lecture.
I'm going to put a twist on that because

88
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,780
what you think about the nature of
reality appears to have some powerful

89
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,110
relationship with how that reality
unfolds itself and the existentialists,

90
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,310
the phenomenologists.
We're very big believers in the reality

91
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:09,410
of subjective experience and the
existentialists.

92
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:14,060
We're very big believers in the ethical
responsibility of the individual.

93
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,990
And I'm going to talk to you about what
happened in the Soviet Union between

94
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:22,991
1919 in 1959 which is a period of world
history that isn't well covered in our

95
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:25,420
culture.
I mean,

96
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,530
everybody knows about the Nazi
Holocaust,

97
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,550
but very few people know that between 30
million and 60 million people were

98
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:35,300
killed as a consequence of internal
repression in the Soviet Union between

99
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:40,301
1919 to 1959 that's a figure that is
five times as big as the commonly held

100
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:44,720
figures for the Holocaust.
And the reason I'm going to introduce

101
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:47,660
that to you is first you should know
about it because it's the stellar

102
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:50,480
example of what happens when people
abandoned their individual

103
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:51,410
responsibility.

104
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,800
And second and related to that,
it's an object lesson in why in what

105
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:02,450
happens when the presuppositions that
the phenomenologists and the

106
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:05,150
existentialists hailed about the nature
of reality,

107
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,470
we're completely dismissed in favor of a
rationalist,

108
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:14,471
utopianism and rationalist utopias
ideologically rational utopias killed

109
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,360
millions and millions of people in the
20th century.

110
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,360
And it seems to me that you can make a
fairly powerful case that

111
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,993
if,
uh,

112
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,500
if,
if your view of reality when it's played

113
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:38,501
out in the social world turns genocidal
time and time again,

114
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,520
there's probably something existentially
wrong with it.

115
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:49,090
And then a secondary ovation of that
might be if there's something that

116
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:54,791
existentially wrong with a viewpoint in,
in what way can you consider it tenable

117
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,470
even if it makes sense.
And it's rational.

118
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,610
If the outcome is genocide and deceit
and misery,

119
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,240
it's perfectly reasonable to presume
that that's evidence that it's wrong.

120
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,480
Now,
most of you,

121
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,250
and this is particularly true,
I think of universities are taught a

122
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,260
kind of at least a kind of implicit
moral relativism.

123
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,033
You know,
that it's,

124
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,090
it is and that's fair.
That's reasonable from a scientific

125
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:27,650
perspective at least to some point.

126
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:35,140
But there's a problem with that because
there are forms of moral presupposition

127
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:41,290
that seemed to lead to horrendous ends
and it's always struck me because I grew

128
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:46,760
up like you and under the shadow of
nuclear destruction,

129
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:51,080
so to speak,
it always has struck me that if certain

130
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:55,100
viewpoints lead to
genocide load comes,

131
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,200
if they do that consistently,
then it's extremely dangerous for us not

132
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:05,880
to act as if that's wrong.
And of course if something's wrong,

133
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:07,980
then that also implies that something is
right,

134
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,630
right?
Because the opposite of wrong just

135
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,180
right.
And so even if you can't necessarily

136
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:15,270
figure out what's right,
you might be able to ground yourself to

137
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:18,090
some degree by figuring out what's
wrong.

138
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,590
And so we'll walk through the philosophy
and the psychology first and then we'll

139
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:26,850
walk through the sociological
consequences of it's abandonment in a

140
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:30,090
sense and well then you can see for
yourself if you think that this

141
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:32,940
perspective is worthy of some
consideration.

142
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,790
It's very complicated.

143
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,723
Okay,

144
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,010
well we'll look at this first.

145
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,433
Okay.

146
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:48,370
Phenomenology in part is based on this
idea of [inaudible] and [inaudible]

147
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,280
means being there.
And again,

148
00:09:51,281 --> 00:09:54,640
this way of simplifying madness is to
think about it as your experience.

149
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,590
And then this is a map I've made of
people's experience,

150
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,660
which I think is at least roughly
equivalent to the phenomenologists

151
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:07,240
design.
And it has the advantage that I can

152
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:09,190
explain it well,
so I'm going to use it.

153
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:13,000
And so the phenomenologists believed
that the past and the present and the

154
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:18,001
future all tangled up together in your
current experience in that say

155
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,090
everything that you're doing is related
to the future,

156
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,140
which of course is because you're
sitting in this class that has some

157
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:28,060
consequences for whether or not you
graduate.

158
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:32,920
And that has some consequences for your
status and your career moving forward.

159
00:10:32,921 --> 00:10:37,480
And you're perfectly aware of that so
that you experienced the meaning of the,

160
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,820
the lecture say in the context of your
conceptions of the future.

161
00:10:42,821 --> 00:10:47,680
And of course the same thing is true of
your experience now because of your

162
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:51,430
past.
And so the past and the future in some

163
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:56,080
sense are here now.
It's partly because

164
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,440
when you're experiencing things,

165
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,370
okay,

166
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,280
you consider your current situation and
you consider

167
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,100
where it is that you're headed.
And so dad's side and also has this

168
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:14,320
element of becoming in it.
There's you're not just a static thing

169
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:19,420
and you don't ever experience anything
that's in your environment as something

170
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:22,810
that's merely static.
You always experiencing,

171
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,020
you're always experiencing it in
relationship to your plans for

172
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:28,570
transformation.
And that might be short term,

173
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,660
like maybe your board of the class
because you need to go get a cup of

174
00:11:31,661 --> 00:11:36,300
coffee and not colors your current
experience or maybe it's long term or

175
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,660
medium term.
It doesn't matter.

176
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,930
The point is is that your viewpoint of
the future conditions,

177
00:11:40,931 --> 00:11:44,440
your experience in the present.
So in some sense the future is already

178
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:47,230
here.
It's also the case that what you do now

179
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:50,650
is going to have effects and
consequences into the future.

180
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,710
Here's a,
here's the more complicated consequence.

181
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,370
So you're somewhere now and you're going
somewhere in the future and one of the

182
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:16,550
consequences of that is that your
nervous system,

183
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,290
it's one way of looking at it parses up
the world in relationship to the

184
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:24,560
relationship between those two poles.
So,

185
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:27,800
for example,
when you walk into a class and your plan

186
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:30,830
is to sit down,
then you're immediately going to

187
00:12:30,831 --> 00:12:34,640
perceive an array of chairs.
Imagine you were coming in here to clean

188
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:38,420
up the room instead of sitting down for
a lecture.

189
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:43,910
Well then the things that would manifest
themselves to you would be qualitatively

190
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:46,460
different.
So maybe you'd only be looking for the

191
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:50,540
things that were out of place.
Or maybe you're coming in here because

192
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,970
you're a spectacularly lonesome and you
think that you know there's some buddy

193
00:12:55,971 --> 00:12:59,270
here who might be a potential partner.
And then the world's going to array

194
00:12:59,271 --> 00:13:01,820
itself in front of you in a different
manner.

195
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,680
And the degree to which what you're
pursuing in relationship to where you

196
00:13:06,681 --> 00:13:11,681
are determines even how the objects of
the world manifest themselves to you is

197
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,210
indeterminate.

198
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:21,730
It happens to a tremendous degree.
And it's not only that things manifest

199
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:26,810
themselves to you as objects in
relationship to your conception of your

200
00:13:26,811 --> 00:13:31,670
current situation and your goals,
but your emotions are also hang on that

201
00:13:31,671 --> 00:13:33,380
platform.
So,

202
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:35,840
for example,
if you're writing an exam and you expect

203
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:39,080
to see you're hoping for a c and you get
a b,

204
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,750
then you're going to be extremely happy
about it.

205
00:13:41,751 --> 00:13:44,450
But if you are hoping for an a and you
get a b,

206
00:13:44,451 --> 00:13:46,850
then you're going to be extremely
unhappy about it.

207
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,800
And what's interesting about that is
that in some sense the stimulus as the

208
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:56,210
behaviors would have it is the same,
but the emotional consequences actually

209
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:59,240
reversed.
It seems to me to be sort of related to

210
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:01,940
the idea of Maya,
which is a Buddhist idea,

211
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:06,230
which is that people live inside a
framework that's conditioned by desire

212
00:14:06,231 --> 00:14:08,750
and as a consequence it's not actually
real.

213
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:14,380
And the unreal lead,
the unreality of it is that you can

214
00:14:14,781 --> 00:14:19,781
change what manifests itself to you and
the importance of what manifests itself

215
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:23,210
to you by changing your conception of
your,

216
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,070
of your goal,
your future,

217
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:30,220
or also by changing your conception of
who and where you are right now.

218
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,280
And so in that sense being your
experiences malleable and

219
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,520
it's,
it's,

220
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,100
it's malleable at least in part as a
consequences of the choices that you

221
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:47,850
make.
And so what that implies from a

222
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,300
phenomenological perspective is that
freewill and the manner in which the

223
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:59,081
world manifests itself are integrally
related and from an existential point of

224
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:04,250
view,
it implies that you actually bear a fair

225
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:09,251
bit of responsibility for the ongoing
quality of your experience.

226
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,950
And the existentialists would presume
that that responsibility is built into

227
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:18,800
the nature of being.
There's no way out of it.

228
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,110
It's like a precondition for being

229
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,130
they,
the word phenomenon is from a Greek word

230
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,110
and the Greek word is famous thigh and
what saint is thigh means is to shine

231
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:46,060
forth.
Now one of the presuppositions of the

232
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,240
phenomenal logical viewpoint is that
reality and in some sense is composed of

233
00:15:51,971 --> 00:15:56,020
what shines forth.
Now this is a very difficult thing to

234
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,960
explain,
but I can do it partly this way.

235
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,410
So when you're moving from point a to
point b,

236
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,770
you can parse the world up into tools
and obstacles.

237
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,460
I showed you that in the last slide.
Tools or things that get you to where

238
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:11,870
you're going.
And so what the tools are,

239
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:14,920
it depends on where you're going and
obstacles are the things that get in

240
00:16:14,921 --> 00:16:17,620
your way.
And so if you perceive tools,

241
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:19,660
then that makes you happy because
happiness,

242
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:23,020
at least in part,
is experienced in relationship to

243
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:25,990
movement towards a goal.
And if you experienced nothing but

244
00:16:25,991 --> 00:16:28,150
obstacles that's going to produce
negative emotion.

245
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:33,460
And so this is a variant of that.
And the variant is when you're moving

246
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:36,160
from point a to point b,
you can experience things that you

247
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:41,161
predict or desire and those make you
hopeful and happy or you can experience

248
00:16:42,881 --> 00:16:45,790
things that are unpredictable and those
make you,

249
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,070
those are threats and they make you
anxious,

250
00:16:48,071 --> 00:16:52,120
but it's broader than that.
They disinhibit negative emotion in a

251
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:56,230
more general sense.
But sometimes you can experience

252
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:07,260
something that's so unpredicted and so
shocking that it blows the framework

253
00:17:08,831 --> 00:17:10,080
that you're using it.
It,

254
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:10,600
it,
it,

255
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,940
what would you say the phenomenologists
called?

256
00:17:12,941 --> 00:17:15,760
That loss of world,
the framework,

257
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:20,940
the thing that you encounter is so
unexpected that it's appearance blows

258
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,450
the structure of being apart.
And that happens,

259
00:17:25,451 --> 00:17:27,880
for example,
when people are betrayed by someone that

260
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:31,720
they love or maybe they're very
seriously hurt or they develop a very

261
00:17:31,721 --> 00:17:35,170
serious illness or,
or a dream that they've been pursuing

262
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:38,590
for a long period of time,
he's rendered impossible by some failure

263
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,640
or,
or some unexpected natural occurrence.

264
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,630
Now,
part of the question is,

265
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,690
what do you,
when your world falls apart,

266
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,380
your world emerges from something and
then when it falls apart,

267
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:58,620
it falls back into that something that
chaotic state.

268
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,040
And that the phenomenologists say that
what you experience most basically is

269
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,310
meaning.
So for,

270
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,260
from a phenomenological perspective,
when,

271
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:14,820
when you're looking at the world you
perceive meaning and then you derive

272
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,850
objects from that and you just arrived,
the objects in relationship to your

273
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,850
representation of your current state and
your future state.

274
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,960
So from a phenomenological perspective,
the base of the world is meaning.

275
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,300
Now I can,
I can give you some hints about how that

276
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:34,930
plays itself out.
So,

277
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,480
so,
so one

278
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,460
interesting phenomena

279
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,953
is

280
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,200
how interest guides your ability to
concentrate.

281
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,170
Okay.
So let's say that you've got,

282
00:18:48,171 --> 00:18:50,720
uh,
an array of difficult papers on your

283
00:18:50,721 --> 00:18:52,130
desk.
And you have to read them.

284
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,880
Now.
Some of those papers independently of

285
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:59,000
their difficulty,
some of those papers will presume that

286
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:02,930
you're actually interested in and some
of them you're not interested in.

287
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,720
And so,
so the papers that you're interested in

288
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,960
come with this quality that the
phenomenologists described,

289
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:14,590
a shining forth.
There's something about them that grips

290
00:19:14,591 --> 00:19:17,860
your attention,
that enables you to concentrate,

291
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,480
that enables you learn and that enables
you to remember and in a relatively

292
00:19:22,481 --> 00:19:24,490
effort,
effortless way.

293
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,310
Whereas the other papers that you're not
interested in,

294
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,320
assuming there have equivalent
difficulty,

295
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,510
it's very difficult to focus your
attention on and they lie there in sort

296
00:19:34,511 --> 00:19:37,210
of an inert manner.
So,

297
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:38,970
okay.

298
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,690
The fit thin,
his thigh phenomenon is partially

299
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:47,691
apprehendable by considering what the
differences to you between something

300
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:51,930
that you're interested in and something
that you're not now.

301
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,523
Yeah,

302
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:03,350
someone like you would think of that
interest as a consequence of an internal

303
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:07,310
process,
a psychological process that's guiding

304
00:20:07,311 --> 00:20:10,320
your attention.
But the phenomenologists at least in,

305
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,320
it's tricky because they go both ways on
this would consider the fact that some

306
00:20:15,321 --> 00:20:19,880
things are illuminated so that they're
easy to concentrate on is actually a

307
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:23,660
function of being itself.
It isn't something that you apply to the

308
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:25,580
world.
It's a characteristic of being.

309
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,630
Some things shine forth as meaningful
and some things don't.

310
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,610
Now the existentialists would say at
least in part that you have a duty to

311
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:39,110
follow the things that shine forth.
That's where the moral element of this

312
00:20:39,111 --> 00:20:41,840
comes in.
Now,

313
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,870
Ben Swagger said,
for example,

314
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:49,280
what we perceive our first foremost not
impressions of tastes,

315
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,620
tone,
smell or touch.

316
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,500
Not even things or objects,
but meanings.

317
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,980
And then Ben Swagger and boss split on
the

318
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:03,620
reason for
why some things manifest themselves as

319
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:10,530
compelling and some things don't.
Bins Wanger would say that you come

320
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:16,270
equipped with an,
it's like it's a Kantian idea with an a

321
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:21,271
priori ontological structure and that's,
imagine you're reading a book.

322
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,600
Okay.

323
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,230
So then you might say,
and the book obviously has meaning

324
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,970
you're reading it and you're,
you're into it.

325
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,600
You might ask yourself,
where is the book?

326
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,200
Okay.

327
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,370
And you could say,
well,

328
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,980
the book is the physical object that I
have in my hand.

329
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,430
I mean that's,
that's what people act like in some

330
00:21:44,431 --> 00:21:45,870
sense.
Or at least that's what they say.

331
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,510
They act like the book is the physical
object.

332
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,620
But then person a might read the book
and say,

333
00:21:52,621 --> 00:21:55,560
I thought that was a terrible book.
And Person B might read that book and

334
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:56,820
say,
I thought that was a great book.

335
00:21:56,821 --> 00:22:00,990
And Person A and B might differ on how
they responded to the characters.

336
00:22:00,991 --> 00:22:04,330
And they're going to differ in terms of
how the imagine the situation.

337
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,460
And like there's a tremendous amount of
flexibility in exactly what constitutes

338
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:10,950
the book.
And so you'd say,

339
00:22:10,951 --> 00:22:14,190
well,
the book is an artifact and the artifact

340
00:22:14,191 --> 00:22:19,080
is produced by the the author.
But of course it's not just produced by

341
00:22:19,081 --> 00:22:23,850
the author because it's produced inside
a cultural context that shape the author

342
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:24,750
and that shaped you.

343
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,480
And then you bring something to bear on
the book,

344
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,820
which is the sum total of your
individual knowledge and you're

345
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,710
enculturated knowledge.
And so what that means is that it's

346
00:22:34,711 --> 00:22:39,711
almost as if there's a pattern that
constitutes you and there's a pattern

347
00:22:39,721 --> 00:22:43,200
that constitutes the book and when you
put the two of them together,

348
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,640
you get a juxtaposition of the two
patterns and it's the juxtaposition

349
00:22:47,641 --> 00:22:51,720
that's the book and it's,
it's the realization of it.

350
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,780
This in some part it's led to the
oddities of postmodernism and and to the

351
00:22:57,421 --> 00:23:02,421
claim that there's no canonical meaning
to any given text because it's a matter

352
00:23:02,671 --> 00:23:04,410
of interpretation.
It's like,

353
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,900
yeah,
well just because it's a matter of

354
00:23:06,901 --> 00:23:11,901
interpretation and even maybe just
because the interpretations are very

355
00:23:11,911 --> 00:23:14,940
wide in potential scope,
that doesn't mean that the text doesn't

356
00:23:14,941 --> 00:23:17,670
have any meaning,
but you can understand how that idea

357
00:23:17,671 --> 00:23:20,610
might've come about now for been
swinger.

358
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,400
The reason the book would be meaningful,
at least in part it's because you're

359
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:29,180
imposing something on it and so that
would be your individuality.

360
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,960
Boss would say the opposite.
He would say,

361
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:33,381
well,
no,

362
00:23:33,381 --> 00:23:38,381
the book itself is manifesting its
meaning to you in some sense of its own

363
00:23:39,171 --> 00:23:41,840
accord and that that's because

364
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,170
boss doesn't make a distinction

365
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:50,070
between the thing.
The book and the entire context within

366
00:23:50,071 --> 00:23:52,890
which it's embedded.
And he would consider the meaning

367
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:55,560
emerging as a consequence of that entire
context.

368
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,390
You can't separate the book out from the
situation in which it's embedded.

369
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,580
Here's a map that I made a while back
that helped me understand this,

370
00:24:11,581 --> 00:24:16,581
at least to some degree,
the phenomenologists talk about three

371
00:24:17,851 --> 00:24:22,080
elements of being of Dad's side.
One is the unwell,

372
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,030
the other,
another is the Mitt wealth.

373
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,080
And the third is the AIGA dwells.
And there are various ways to

374
00:24:28,081 --> 00:24:30,870
conceptualize these.
And I can give you a couple.

375
00:24:30,871 --> 00:24:33,660
Now,
the Umwelt is the natural world.

376
00:24:33,661 --> 00:24:37,230
So when we say nature,
that's what we mean.

377
00:24:37,231 --> 00:24:37,831
We say,
well,

378
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:41,880
human beings live in nature.
We have a natural environment.

379
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:45,600
So the idea that there's a natural
environment is like a canonical idea.

380
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,370
And,
and you know,

381
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,770
we,
we even think of the natural environment

382
00:24:49,771 --> 00:24:54,210
sometimes as the unspoiled natural
environment as if they're our natural

383
00:24:54,211 --> 00:24:57,930
environments that exist in the complete
absence of human

384
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:00,763
endeavor.

385
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,870
And then we also have a social world.
And the social world is the world of

386
00:25:06,871 --> 00:25:08,880
culture.
So there's nature and culture.

387
00:25:08,881 --> 00:25:12,930
And that's Umwelt and Mitt wealth.
And then finally,

388
00:25:12,931 --> 00:25:15,360
other than that,
there's the world of the self,

389
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:20,930
which is the part of being
your being that's only accessible to

390
00:25:22,691 --> 00:25:24,430
you.
So it's you

391
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,350
in,
in the middle of culture,

392
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:34,180
in the middle of nature.
And so those are the elements of

393
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,870
Dad's side.
And

394
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,190
for
Ben Swagger,

395
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,640
it's the mid belt that contains most of
the meaning,

396
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,800
or at least that structures the meaning.
So if you're reading a great novel,

397
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,870
the degree to which you can extract
meaning from it is a consequence of your

398
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,950
previous education and your own
inculturation.

399
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,933
But

400
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,940
that isn't necessarily the only way.
Look at things like

401
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,150
if you walk into a bookstore,
say,

402
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,990
and a book catches your eye,
you might say that that book caught my

403
00:26:17,991 --> 00:26:21,140
eye while you think,
what exactly does that mean?

404
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,530
Well,
it means that out of all the innumerable

405
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,370
entities in the bookstore that could
have caught your eye,

406
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,750
only that one did.
And then you might ask why.

407
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,220
Well,
in Boston would say,

408
00:26:34,221 --> 00:26:37,340
well,
the world is disclosing a particular

409
00:26:37,341 --> 00:26:38,390
meaning to you.

410
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,130
Why?
Well

411
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:52,200
that has something to do with the way
that you're playing out your individual

412
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:53,034
destiny.

413
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,553
Yeah.

414
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:06,290
Let's show you this first.
So this is both a constructivist Stan,

415
00:27:08,261 --> 00:27:10,820
a phenomenological perspective.
And so here,

416
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,860
here's the idea that the thing that's at
the center of reality is the domain

417
00:27:18,101 --> 00:27:20,980
that's not yet mapped.
So

418
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,310
you're in a relationship,

419
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,720
okay.

420
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,640
The relationship is betrayed before
you're betrayed,

421
00:27:30,641 --> 00:27:33,400
you're in one place and after you're
betrayed,

422
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:36,220
you're in another place.
Before you're betrayed,

423
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:41,140
your world is all structured and you
know where you are and what you're doing

424
00:27:41,141 --> 00:27:43,360
and who you're with and what everything
is.

425
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:47,110
The second after you're betrayed.
None of that's true.

426
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,663
And so

427
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,080
the second after your be trade,
nothing is structured.

428
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,800
It's like everything reverts to see to a
chaotic place.

429
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:02,801
And so in some sense,
the only time that you encounter a pure

430
00:28:03,201 --> 00:28:05,690
view of what the world itself is made
out of,

431
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,720
what the ground of being is,
is when you encounter an error that's so

432
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:16,690
overwhelming that your current framework
of meaning is no longer applicable.

433
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,460
So the framework blows apart.
But it isn't as if nothing happens when

434
00:28:22,461 --> 00:28:26,300
the framework blows apart.
Like if you're in a committed

435
00:28:26,301 --> 00:28:30,080
relationship and you find security in
that and you believe that the security

436
00:28:30,081 --> 00:28:34,760
is genuine and that's blows apart,
then everything that you presumed is

437
00:28:34,761 --> 00:28:37,560
wrong,
that's your mid dwelt.

438
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,760
But when that disappears,
there's something underneath it.

439
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,690
And what's underneath it?
That's the,

440
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,670
that's the ground of reality.
And the ground of reality is what you

441
00:28:49,671 --> 00:28:54,671
explore to put yourself back together
and to put the world back together.

442
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,380
So you're betrayed and you fall into a
depression and you're anxious.

443
00:29:00,381 --> 00:29:02,960
But you know,
there's always the possibility of a new

444
00:29:02,961 --> 00:29:06,230
relationship that beckons.
And perhaps your previous relationship

445
00:29:06,231 --> 00:29:09,350
wasn't perfect.
So the chaos that you fall into is

446
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,700
depressing and anxiety provoking.
So generates a lot of negative emotion,

447
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,960
but sort of lurking behind that are the
sort of dim remnants of hope.

448
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,450
And then as you proceed forward with
your grief and your misery,

449
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:28,690
and you're attempting to reconstruct a
stable motive being you take out of that

450
00:29:30,171 --> 00:29:31,550
thing,
that's a normal us,

451
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:37,930
you and the world.
So another way of thinking about this is

452
00:29:39,981 --> 00:29:44,350
that for the phenomenologists,
and this is where they're similar to the

453
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:47,500
constructivists,
the ground of reality isn't so much

454
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:51,520
matter as it is information and when
you're,

455
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:55,120
when you're living in in your
constructed world and things are going

456
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:59,680
the way that you want them to go,
then you've constrained that information

457
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:02,410
in a particular way,
constrained and narrowed it in a

458
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:06,970
particular way that serves your
particular narrow end and that that

459
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,540
makes things much more comfortable
because then you don't have to deal with

460
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,780
the,
the information that constitutes the

461
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:14,800
entire world.

462
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:20,190
You can remove most of it and say,
well all that's relevant to me,

463
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:25,270
all that necessarily makes up my world
of being are these

464
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:31,910
circumscribed is this circumscribed set
of phenomena and that works well when

465
00:30:32,761 --> 00:30:35,460
it's working,
but when it doesn't work and it blows

466
00:30:35,461 --> 00:30:38,170
apart,
that puts you somewhere else and that

467
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:42,570
that being put somewhere else can be
well revelatory sometimes.

468
00:30:42,571 --> 00:30:46,650
I mean sometimes people make new
discoveries that blow their previous

469
00:30:46,651 --> 00:30:50,400
frames of reference and it's like are
inspiring and overwhelming to them in a

470
00:30:50,401 --> 00:30:54,090
positive way.
Sometimes you can come across something

471
00:30:54,091 --> 00:30:59,091
new that helps you reconfigure the way
that you're living almost instantly in a

472
00:31:00,061 --> 00:31:04,500
more comprehensive and fuller way.
But more common is the traumatic

473
00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:07,680
response,
which is when the presuppositions of

474
00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:12,681
your world are shifted dramatically and
you fall into the surrounding chaos,

475
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:18,560
then it's so hard on you that you know
it actually does use psychophysiological

476
00:31:18,721 --> 00:31:19,554
damage.

477
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,013
No.

478
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:31,710
You remember that
drawing I showed you

479
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:37,750
with the little ovals at the bottom and
the bigger ovals at the top,

480
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:40,030
the hierarchy,
you remember that?

481
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:45,031
Does everybody remember that
I decomposed say good person,

482
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:50,190
which is a very high order abstraction
down to put a fork on the table,

483
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:53,470
which is a motor movement that's part of
making dinner,

484
00:31:53,471 --> 00:31:57,220
which is part of being a good parent,
which is part of being a good citizen,

485
00:31:57,221 --> 00:32:00,730
which is part of being a good person.
So the idea was that the higher order

486
00:32:00,731 --> 00:32:05,731
abstractions can be concretized down to
the motor behaviors in hierarchy.

487
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,020
Okay.
Now.

488
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,093
Yeah,

489
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:16,250
if someone goes after you at the good
person level of analysis and they just

490
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,280
demolish you,
you know in the course of say a three

491
00:32:20,281 --> 00:32:25,281
year relationship hacking away at the
idea that you have any moral worth

492
00:32:25,741 --> 00:32:28,290
whatsoever,
this is what happens when you're abused,

493
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,740
then that's going to knock you into
pieces at a very complex and high level

494
00:32:35,281 --> 00:32:37,410
of abstraction.
So that can undermine your entire

495
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,240
worldview if the person instead,

496
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:41,940
yeah,

497
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,690
helps you retool the little behaviors
and little micro structures that make

498
00:32:45,691 --> 00:32:49,170
you up and if you're willing to
participate in that and if you're open

499
00:32:49,171 --> 00:32:54,000
to corrective feedback from the world,
then you can continually adjust yourself

500
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:58,590
at a small level and then that makes the
things in the hierarchy little higher,

501
00:32:58,591 --> 00:33:01,350
a little healthier,
and then that makes the aggregation of

502
00:33:01,351 --> 00:33:03,540
those things a little higher in the
hierarchy,

503
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:05,040
a little healthier and little more
complete.

504
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,420
Then you can do this

505
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,080
bit by bit retooling
without ever having to suffer the

506
00:33:13,661 --> 00:33:16,240
demolition of huge chunks of your
personality.

507
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,360
So let's go back to the relationship
where there's a betrayal.

508
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:24,780
It's like virtually every time someone
gets flipped upside down because of a

509
00:33:25,751 --> 00:33:29,080
betrayal interrelationship after the
betrayal happens,

510
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,560
they say to themselves,
there were all these signs I didn't pay

511
00:33:32,561 --> 00:33:37,561
attention to.
So when maybe the first sign is who

512
00:33:37,571 --> 00:33:40,540
knows,
your partner starts to flirt a bit more

513
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:45,340
when you go out on a social occasion and
not a lot more,

514
00:33:45,341 --> 00:33:50,110
just a bit more and you decide because
maybe you're timid that that that's

515
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,540
okay,
you're not going to just do anything

516
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:54,490
about it but,
but it's,

517
00:33:55,810 --> 00:34:00,810
it's interesting that it happens.
It grabs your attention and it means

518
00:34:03,071 --> 00:34:06,550
something.
But what you decide is it's not worth

519
00:34:06,551 --> 00:34:09,910
paying attention to.
And so maybe the next eight times that

520
00:34:09,911 --> 00:34:12,040
you go out,
the same thing happens,

521
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:16,840
but it happens at a somewhat accelerated
rate and then maybe the person starts to

522
00:34:16,841 --> 00:34:21,760
go out without you and so on.
There's this progression towards the end

523
00:34:21,761 --> 00:34:25,000
state of betrayal and every time you get
a little hint,

524
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,120
the world tells you that something's
going on,

525
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:32,770
you put it aside and you failed to take
it into account.

526
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:37,960
Well
you're forgoing your opportunity.

527
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:39,460
Yeah,

528
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:43,300
to adjust the relationship.
At micro stages because maybe what you

529
00:34:43,301 --> 00:34:46,960
should've done the first time that
happened is you should have gone home

530
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:48,990
with your partner and sad,
um,

531
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,710
what the hell is going on?
Like this is what was happening,

532
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,180
why are you doing that?
Um,

533
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,140
here's how you should have behaved.
And of course that's going to be a

534
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:01,030
fight.
There's absolutely no doubt about it,

535
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,463
but

536
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
it might be a micro fight instead of a,
the relationship is over fight and in

537
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:14,380
order to keep our relationship healthy,
it needs,

538
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:16,370
yeah,
it'd be retooled at micro levels

539
00:35:16,371 --> 00:35:20,360
constantly and the same as the case with
your own character.

540
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,450
When you encounter something that's
unexpected,

541
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,030
especially if it's small enough to
handle,

542
00:35:26,031 --> 00:35:28,070
you need to extract the information from
it,

543
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:32,450
rebuild the world and rebuild yourself.
And then maybe if you continue doing

544
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:35,660
that,
every time you get evidence of an

545
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:39,000
anomaly or an error or every the world
manifest some meaning to you,

546
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,530
then you won't have to fall apart
because the structure that constitutes

547
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:48,531
you is going to remain viable and
healthy from the bottom up.

548
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,590
And if you don't do that,
then those errors are going to

549
00:35:52,591 --> 00:35:57,591
accumulate.
And when they finally do manifest

550
00:35:57,841 --> 00:36:00,360
themselves as unavoidable,
like when your partner says,

551
00:36:00,361 --> 00:36:04,200
I don't want to be with you anymore,
or I've been with someone else for the

552
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,940
last year,
there's no ignoring that,

553
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,190
then the whole thing comes crashing
down.

554
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,850
You're no longer in a relationship,
you're no longer in a good relationship.

555
00:36:11,851 --> 00:36:13,800
And then all the other things become
questionable.

556
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:19,910
So
meaning manifests itself

557
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,880
so that you can read tool
being itself.

558
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:30,730
Yeah,

559
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:35,730
on a continual basis.
Well simultaneously minimizing the risk

560
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:41,451
of total collapse and morality then
becomes the act of paying sufficient

561
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:50,601
attention and reacting sufficiently so
that that corrective process occurs now.

562
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:07,310
So you're inside one of these,
you're going from point a to point b.

563
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:10,190
And as you do that,
things you want to have happen,

564
00:37:10,191 --> 00:37:14,660
happen and things you don't want to have
happen and things you don't understand

565
00:37:14,661 --> 00:37:17,960
happen.
And let's say that you investigate

566
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,230
the things that you don't want to have
happen and you investigate the things

567
00:37:23,231 --> 00:37:26,290
that you didn't expect and you do that
as soon as they come up.

568
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,890
So then what happens?
Well,

569
00:37:29,891 --> 00:37:34,891
partly what happens is you're going to
change your perceptions a bit and you're

570
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:37,980
going to change your actions a bit.
And what that'll,

571
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,110
okay

572
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,990
culminating over time is that this whole
structural change.

573
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,320
So instead of going from point a to
point b,

574
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:50,120
maybe you start shifting so that you're
going from point a to point c because as

575
00:37:50,121 --> 00:37:54,890
you're gathering information,
as a consequence of the inadequacies of

576
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:59,630
the way you're looking at the world,
not only are you improving your ability

577
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:04,010
to perceive and to act,
but you're also gathering information

578
00:38:04,011 --> 00:38:07,700
that helps shift your perspective to a
better point b.

579
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:08,451
Because you might say,
well,

580
00:38:08,451 --> 00:38:11,480
where are you going and why?
And the answer to that is while you have

581
00:38:11,481 --> 00:38:13,160
a plan,
you're going to get your degree.

582
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:17,990
I don't know what your longterm plan is,
but there's no reason to assume that

583
00:38:17,991 --> 00:38:22,880
your longterm plan is correct even
though there's no reason to assume that

584
00:38:22,881 --> 00:38:26,360
you can do without one.
So you're in this weird situation where

585
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:30,680
you have to live within a bounded space
and the bounded space is going to

586
00:38:30,681 --> 00:38:33,440
produce errors and it's also going to be
wrong.

587
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:38,110
But at the same,
if you use the bounded space,

588
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:41,110
then you can transform it continually
across time,

589
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,970
even what it's aimed at and you can
minimize the probability of precipitous

590
00:38:45,971 --> 00:38:46,804
collapse.

591
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,613
Now

592
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,710
I want to show you how this has been
represented.

593
00:38:52,711 --> 00:38:55,710
It's very complicated and difficult.

594
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:57,670
Okay?

595
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:02,670
So on the right you see that the Harry
Potter snitch thing,

596
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,720
right?
And then on the left here you see this

597
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,780
incredibly peculiar l chemical
image.

598
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,520
And the image is something like this.
This is what this image means.

599
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:22,960
It means at the base of the world is
this weird combination of matter and

600
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:25,180
spirit.
So this is matter and this is spirit.

601
00:39:25,181 --> 00:39:29,410
The winged element represents spirit.
And then out of that comes something

602
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:34,411
that's like primordial and Reptilian.
And then out of that comes something

603
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:37,340
that's associated with consciousness.
So it's,

604
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,433
it's like,
uh,

605
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,240
it's a map of the way that consciousness
emerges from the base of reality.

606
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,023
Now

607
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,140
you'll see that this thing and that
thing,

608
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,010
the snitch and that this thing is called
a round chaos.

609
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,710
This thing,
the snatch and the round chaos are the

610
00:39:55,711 --> 00:39:59,850
same thing.
Now in in Harry Potter,

611
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,560
when he plays Quidditch,
remember piaget had such an emphasis on

612
00:40:04,561 --> 00:40:05,394
games,
right?

613
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:08,400
Piaget believed that games were the sub
elements of human culture.

614
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,860
And quidditch is this weird two level
game.

615
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,380
We're on one level,
it's sort of like soccer,

616
00:40:13,381 --> 00:40:16,350
basketball,
and then on another level you have two

617
00:40:16,351 --> 00:40:19,920
players that are seekers.
And what they seek is this snitch

618
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:25,500
and the snatch is this thing that
captures your attention.

619
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,110
That's why it's Goldman winging.
It moves around very fast.

620
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,480
It's like mercury,
the spirit mercury,

621
00:40:30,481 --> 00:40:35,010
because mercury,
the God had winged feet and he was the

622
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,580
messenger of the gods.
So that's,

623
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,820
that's how mercury was conceived of it.
I'll tell you something else that's

624
00:40:41,821 --> 00:40:44,880
weird about mercury.
So mercury is a metal as well.

625
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,170
And if you mix mercury with sand and the
sand has gold in it,

626
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,470
then the mercury will pick up the sound
and then or the gold,

627
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,170
and then you can heat up the mercury.
And all that's left is gold.

628
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,300
So Mercury will lead you to where the
gold is and the spirit Mercurius the

629
00:41:00,301 --> 00:41:03,390
mercurial spirit was the messenger of
the gods.

630
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,480
And if you paid attention to mercury,
the God,

631
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,290
then you gathered the gold.
But it wasn't the gold of fools.

632
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:12,780
It was the gold that made your lives
valuable.

633
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:16,680
And that's the same thing that's played
out in this weird quidditch game.

634
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,320
The two best players,
the fastest,

635
00:41:19,321 --> 00:41:22,470
the ones that are most awake aren't
playing the normal game.

636
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:27,540
They're playing a super ordinate game
and the super ordered game is pay

637
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:30,270
attention,
pay attention.

638
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,620
And if you pay attention then you'll get
the thing

639
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,440
that's most valuable.
You win the game.

640
00:41:38,441 --> 00:41:40,870
But there's more than that because in
the Harry Potter series,

641
00:41:40,871 --> 00:41:42,820
for example,
there was a piece of soul in that.

642
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:48,460
And that's related to the idea that if
you pay attention to what interests you,

643
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:53,980
what manifest itself is meaning full.
Not only do you build the world out of

644
00:41:53,981 --> 00:41:58,600
that because you're differentiating
something that's undifferentiated into

645
00:41:58,601 --> 00:42:00,520
something that's comprehensible and
usable,

646
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,370
but at the same time you're doing the
same thing to yourself.

647
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,740
Cause.
And that's the constructivist idea,

648
00:42:05,741 --> 00:42:06,510
right?
It's that,

649
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,343
well,
where do you,

650
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,650
where do you come from?

651
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:13,860
Well,
you come from exploration and the

652
00:42:13,861 --> 00:42:15,870
generation of information and
exploration.

653
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:21,290
What should you explore while the things
that shine forth to you?

654
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:27,740
That's the phenomenal logical idea and
existential idea is if you refuse to

655
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,760
explore the things that shine forth for
you,

656
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:35,550
that capture your interest in your
attention,

657
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:41,600
then that will lessen you as a big,
it'll make you weaker and progressively

658
00:42:42,391 --> 00:42:45,750
weaker because not only do you remain
unformed,

659
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:51,080
but the ratio of chaos to world in your
domain of being becomes too intolerable,

660
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,640
too much chaos,
not enough order,

661
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:01,350
not enough of you.
Then the whole thing is unstable.

662
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:06,030
Then you've only got two options.
One is that you lose belief than being

663
00:43:06,031 --> 00:43:08,850
itself and that's like a nihilistic
reaction.

664
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:14,150
And the other is you turn to some sort
of totalitarian or ideological solution

665
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:20,270
that fills in for where you're not,
and that's an abdication of your

666
00:43:21,841 --> 00:43:26,100
individual responsibility.
And the consequences of turning to

667
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:30,450
totalitarian ideologies like that is
that

668
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:36,980
they stagnate and become brittle because
there's no transformation in them

669
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:39,930
anymore.
Because all of the people inside of them

670
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,740
have decided that transformation is
unnecessary.

671
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,160
And so they become increasingly outdated
and corrupt.

672
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,753
And then

673
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,080
okay,

674
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:57,080
that's the first step on the way to
having everything fall apart in the most

675
00:43:57,391 --> 00:44:02,250
horrible possible way.
And that plays out at the state level,

676
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:04,740
just like it plays out at the individual
level.

677
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,330
I'll tell you a dream I had about this
since we're just out of the

678
00:44:15,331 --> 00:44:18,270
psychoanalytic domain,
I can show you using this,

679
00:44:18,271 --> 00:44:22,730
how dreams often
solve problems.

680
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:26,933
Okay,

681
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,120
I'll just read it to you cause I wrote
it when I just,

682
00:44:30,121 --> 00:44:33,870
after I had it all,
I'll just tell it to you.

683
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,473
So

684
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,720
the first thing I saw was
it was like a view from a space shuttle.

685
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:51,840
So it was a global view and I could see
the Atlantic Ocean and on the surface of

686
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:56,710
the Atlanta Goshen,
there were four hurricanes and they were

687
00:44:56,711 --> 00:45:01,240
in a quadrant like this.
So there was a circle here in a circle

688
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:06,241
here in a circle here in a circle here.
And then we're very large hurricanes.

689
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,370
I mean one hurricanes quite good.
But for,

690
00:45:09,371 --> 00:45:12,010
that's a lot of hurricanes.
So it was impressive.

691
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:17,670
And so then the next thing I saw was a
bank of scientists in kind of a dark

692
00:45:18,311 --> 00:45:23,311
room watching TV screens focused on this
hurricane storm event and wondering what

693
00:45:26,411 --> 00:45:29,770
was going on.
And then the next thing I saw was this

694
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:34,771
little ball about this big hovering over
the surface of the ocean.

695
00:45:34,991 --> 00:45:39,220
So now I was in the eye.
So the four hurricanes had an eye in the

696
00:45:39,221 --> 00:45:40,810
middle of the immuno,
a calm place.

697
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:43,870
And so this little ball,
which was about 10 feet above the

698
00:45:43,871 --> 00:45:46,580
surface of the water,
was in that calm place.

699
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,960
And the storms were,
it's a company mint.

700
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,140
So,
and it was zooming along at a very rapid

701
00:45:53,141 --> 00:45:55,150
rate and it was bringing the storms with
them.

702
00:45:55,810 --> 00:46:00,100
And so all of the scientists with their
satellites,

703
00:46:00,101 --> 00:46:04,120
we're trying to figure out what this
little ball that was 10 feet off the

704
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:09,080
ocean surface and the needed like four
hurricanes to accompany in that a

705
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:11,920
company yet they're trying to figure out
what this thing was.

706
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:17,040
Okay.
So the next scene was I was a third

707
00:46:17,261 --> 00:46:20,710
person observer and I was in this room.
It was a small room,

708
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,950
about eight by eight,
say in the middle of the room there was

709
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:27,210
this display case like a museum,
you know,

710
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,350
like a Victorian Museum.
So it was made out of wood,

711
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:34,560
the top,
it had this glass and inside the case

712
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,880
was this ball and it was just floating.

713
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:40,870
And inside the room was Steven Hawking,
you know,

714
00:46:40,871 --> 00:46:45,871
the physicist in the wheelchair and a
faceless president of the United States.

715
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:49,600
It didn't matter who he was,
it just mattered that he was president

716
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:52,180
of the United States.
And then the room itself,

717
00:46:52,181 --> 00:46:55,930
I remember from the dream was made out
of titanium dioxide.

718
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:58,810
And I woke up and I after this dream and
I thought,

719
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,440
what the hell is titanium dioxide?
And the walls were seven feet thick.

720
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:10,740
So that the idea was that little ball
which had caused those four storms was

721
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:13,210
going to be,
they caught it and they put it in that

722
00:47:13,211 --> 00:47:17,350
room and it was going to stay there.
Titanium dioxide turned out to be the

723
00:47:17,351 --> 00:47:21,000
metal that the hall of the starship
enterprise is built out of.

724
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,010
Yeah.
So it's,

725
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:26,980
it,
it represented like an impermeable

726
00:47:26,981 --> 00:47:30,100
substance.
And so the,

727
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:35,460
so there was this box made out of this
high tech metal and then inside the room

728
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,330
the American president was there.
So he sort of representative of the myth

729
00:47:40,331 --> 00:47:40,931
dwelt,
you know,

730
00:47:40,931 --> 00:47:43,300
the social environment.
He sort of King of the social

731
00:47:43,301 --> 00:47:45,520
environment.
And then Stephen Hawking,

732
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,730
while Stephen Hawking is disembodied
rationality,

733
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:50,770
right?
Obviously.

734
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:56,420
So,
so the room was a classification system

735
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:58,000
in a sense.
And this ball,

736
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:01,270
whatever it was,
was stuck in there.

737
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:05,890
And so it was going to be a thing that
you could look at in a museum and it

738
00:48:05,891 --> 00:48:08,830
wasn't going anywhere.
So it had been fixed.

739
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,140
And so I was watching this thing

740
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,723
and then

741
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:18,460
when I was watching it,
it did two weird things in the museum

742
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:20,590
case,
the first thing it did was turned into a

743
00:48:20,591 --> 00:48:23,740
Chrysalis.
And then you know what a Chrysalis is.

744
00:48:23,741 --> 00:48:26,140
It's like a cocoon that a butterfly
comes out of.

745
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:29,170
And you may not know this,
but the word,

746
00:48:29,171 --> 00:48:31,090
the Greek word for butterflies,
psyche,

747
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:37,030
and the reason the psyche is a butterfly
is because the psyche is something that

748
00:48:37,031 --> 00:48:40,060
transforms and it transforms towards
something.

749
00:48:40,061 --> 00:48:44,320
Let's like an aerial spirit.
So this ball was transforming.

750
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,920
It transformed into a Chrysalis and then
it did a really strange thing.

751
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,310
It transformed into a pipe like a
smoking pipe.

752
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:54,400
It was a mere Sharm pipe,
which is a carve pipe,

753
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:58,000
I think it's Irish sort of looks like a
little saxophone and thing,

754
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:01,810
but it was definitely a pipe.
And so that was the whole dream.

755
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:05,950
And I woke up and I thought I got the
Chrysalis idea,

756
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:12,400
this whatever this ball was,
was the thing that's capable of

757
00:49:12,401 --> 00:49:14,890
transforming.
But then I thought,

758
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,780
what the hell,
what does that mean?

759
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,180
What could that possum pipe possibly
mean?

760
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,153
Yeah,

761
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:28,900
one other thing transformed into
Chrysalis and then back to a ball and

762
00:49:29,481 --> 00:49:34,400
then it transformed into a pipe and then
back into a ball and then went and shot

763
00:49:34,401 --> 00:49:38,390
out of the case and shot right through
the seven feet walls and it was gone and

764
00:49:38,391 --> 00:49:40,220
it just left a hole.
Like there was,

765
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:42,890
it was moving so fast,
there was just a hole in the case and

766
00:49:42,891 --> 00:49:44,510
there was a hole in the wall.
And that was the end of that.

767
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,180
So it,
it was a ball.

768
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,400
It did its Chrysalis thing,
get his pipe thing,

769
00:49:49,401 --> 00:49:54,401
and then it was gone.
That barks was not going to hold it.

770
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,880
So after I had that dream quite a while
later,

771
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,540
two years later,
I read this little poem from Dante is

772
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,070
from the inferno.
The inferno is an interesting book

773
00:50:13,071 --> 00:50:15,970
because it's Dante is attempt.
It's a,

774
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:21,020
it's a book about hell and it's Dante is
attempt in a sense to turn the old idea

775
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:23,090
of hell into something that was
psychological.

776
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:28,690
So Dante has this vision of hell as this
place has multiple depths with something

777
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:34,040
that's the absolute worst right at the
center.

778
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:38,660
So in some sense it's his attempt to
come up with a category structure of,

779
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:41,810
of evil.
He actually puts betrayers right in the

780
00:50:41,811 --> 00:50:44,660
center.
He figured that was the worst form of,

781
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:50,300
of moral error.
Anyways,

782
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,520
here's part of the poem.
Virgil and Dante are going into the

783
00:50:54,521 --> 00:50:56,470
inferno.
Virgil's the guide.

784
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:00,040
Suddenly they're broke on the dirty
swell of the dark marsh,

785
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,900
a squall of terrible sound that sent a
tremor through both shores of hell.

786
00:51:04,901 --> 00:51:09,901
A sound as if two continents of air,
one frigid in one scorching clashed head

787
00:51:10,181 --> 00:51:13,330
on in a war of wins that strips the
forest bare,

788
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:17,430
ripped off whole boughs and blew them
helter skelter along the range of dust

789
00:51:17,431 --> 00:51:22,431
it raised before it making the beasts
and shepherds run from shelter run for

790
00:51:22,631 --> 00:51:26,170
shelter.
That's a messenger from God comes down

791
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:29,680
and that's how he makes himself
manifested.

792
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:30,241
Right.
Wow.

793
00:51:30,241 --> 00:51:34,560
That's very much like this dream.
I had two continents of air

794
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:36,730
and

795
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:40,630
there was this similar idea that there
was something at the center that was

796
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,970
there.
Couldn't be encapsulated in a,

797
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:44,440
okay,

798
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,530
what a conceptual structure.
At least not for any length of time.

799
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,780
And you know,
being is like that.

800
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:54,220
You can't encapsulate it in a conceptual
structure for any length of time,

801
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,240
no matter what you think you're wrong.
And even if you're right enough for the

802
00:51:58,241 --> 00:52:01,840
time being,
being is transforming and you have to

803
00:52:01,841 --> 00:52:05,680
keep up with it because otherwise the
structure that you were inhabiting

804
00:52:05,681 --> 00:52:09,220
becomes dead and decays and then you
fall apart.

805
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:14,440
And so you need a conceptual structure
because it orients you,

806
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:19,870
but it can't be static.
And that's the problem with totalitarian

807
00:52:19,871 --> 00:52:23,800
ideology is that totalitarian ideology
is predicated on the idea.

808
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:28,660
It's utopia that you can finally model
things once and for all.

809
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,350
And so once you do that,
it's perfect and then it never has to

810
00:52:32,351 --> 00:52:33,880
change.
And that's,

811
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,850
that's wrong.
Technically,

812
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:41,110
it's not wrong arbitrarily.
It's not a kind of a relative wrong,

813
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:45,400
it's just wrong.
And it's because whatever being is,

814
00:52:45,401 --> 00:52:48,160
it's not static.
And so whatever it is that you inhabit

815
00:52:48,161 --> 00:52:53,161
to allow being to work in your favor
also can't be static,

816
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,200
even though it has to be a structure.
Then I figured out why it was a pipe and

817
00:53:02,191 --> 00:53:05,040
not talk about three years for me to
figure that out.

818
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,250
And this is a famous painting by
Magritte,

819
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:10,830
right?
And so it says this is not a pipe.

820
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,720
So what does that mean?

821
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:17,863
What does he mean?

822
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:21,140
The first question is,
is it a pipe?

823
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,800
What did we think?
Kind of idea.

824
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:26,160
But that's

825
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:26,993
the image.

826
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:30,470
It's certainly,
it's actually an image of an image of a

827
00:53:30,471 --> 00:53:31,400
pipe,
right?

828
00:53:31,401 --> 00:53:33,440
Because we're projecting it.
But yes,

829
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:35,960
you're exactly right.
It's not a pipe.

830
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,860
And so what?
What's my greed trying to

831
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:44,630
communicate?
What's the idea?

832
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:54,260
The idea is the conception is not the
object or another way of putting it is

833
00:53:54,261 --> 00:53:58,640
the map is not the territory and you
live in the map in some sense,

834
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:02,960
but the territory is always underneath
it and the reason that little ball

835
00:54:02,961 --> 00:54:06,200
turned into a pipe was to make that
case.

836
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:11,201
It's like it was in this box and it was
being transformed into a,

837
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:18,040
an entity that was defined and static
and it it,

838
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,900
it said two things.
It said,

839
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:23,960
everything transforms.
That's the Chrysalis and everything

840
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:28,961
transforms into psyche because the
butterfly is psyche and then it said

841
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:34,240
don't mistake the map for the territory
and then it left and

842
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:41,740
the being that manifests itself,
the being that shines forth in the

843
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,280
phenomenologists sense is the thing that
cannot be encapsulated inside any

844
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:54,170
conceptual structure.
It's always outside of it.

845
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,650
It's always outside of it and you have
to keep up with it.

846
00:54:57,890 --> 00:54:59,720
Well,
that's why in the Harry Potter book for

847
00:54:59,721 --> 00:55:04,721
example,
the best players don't play that game.

848
00:55:04,771 --> 00:55:09,771
They chased the snitch and what that
means is that they follow what manifests

849
00:55:10,021 --> 00:55:14,760
itself to them as most meaningful at any
given time.

850
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,940
Now young would have thought of that as
the manifestation of the self cause he

851
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:23,880
would say,
and it's like I can never remember who.

852
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:27,810
I can never differentiate these two
thinkers

853
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:37,310
young's like bins wanger he assumes that
the meaning is a consequence of the

854
00:55:38,471 --> 00:55:43,471
action of some internal structure,
more or less that he characterized as

855
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:48,631
the self
boss's perspective is more in some sense

856
00:55:53,631 --> 00:55:55,910
it's more like a classical religious
perspective,

857
00:55:55,911 --> 00:55:59,330
although he dispenses almost entirely
with any religion,

858
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:03,940
just language.
It makes the claim that meaning is the

859
00:56:03,941 --> 00:56:08,941
fundamental fundamental element of being
and that if you lose touch with meaning,

860
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:13,930
then the quality of your being is going
to

861
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:20,600
collapse and not only yours but also the
meaning of the society that you're part

862
00:56:21,151 --> 00:56:22,920
of it.
Because not only when you're,

863
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:25,600
when you're paying attention to what's
meaningful,

864
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:30,670
not only are you updating yourself,
are not,

865
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,460
not only are you improving the quality
of your own being,

866
00:56:33,461 --> 00:56:37,900
but because you're embedded in this myth
welk and you're like a node in a

867
00:56:37,901 --> 00:56:42,901
network,
your transformations effect the

868
00:56:43,511 --> 00:56:45,700
transformations of the people around
you.

869
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:50,740
And so you can't only transform yourself
or fail to,

870
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:54,250
if you transform yourself,
you also transform society.

871
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:58,420
And if you fail to transform yourself,
then you also fail to transform society.

872
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:03,100
And if you fail to transform society,
then it stays static and it stays

873
00:57:03,101 --> 00:57:04,630
static,
then it dies.

874
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,640
And so that's the relationship between
the phenomenal logical viewpoint and the

875
00:57:09,641 --> 00:57:14,300
existential viewpoint.
To me,

876
00:57:14,301 --> 00:57:17,810
what the phenomenologists force you to
grapple with is the phenomena of

877
00:57:17,811 --> 00:57:20,300
meaning.
Because it seems to me,

878
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,240
and this is basically heidegger's point,
he said,

879
00:57:23,241 --> 00:57:26,240
well,
what's self evident?

880
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,900
Well,
one answer is objects.

881
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:32,470
Okay?

882
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:37,090
The other ass answer is,
is is predicated on a different

883
00:57:37,091 --> 00:57:38,240
perspective.
Yeah.

884
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:43,990
Meaning is self evident in that you
can't escape from it.

885
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,690
You can,
you can escape from the positive

886
00:57:46,691 --> 00:57:51,691
elements of it by being locks.
But you cannot escape from the negative

887
00:57:53,231 --> 00:57:55,720
elements of it.
You can't argue yourself out of it.

888
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:56,823
And,
and,

889
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,270
and you act as if there's nothing more
real.

890
00:58:01,271 --> 00:58:03,940
So if you see,
if you think about it this way,

891
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:10,030
if is terrified,
they're going to act it out and you

892
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:13,250
cannot calm them down.
Using rational means if someone's in

893
00:58:13,251 --> 00:58:14,990
pain,
it's the same thing.

894
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:19,430
Both anxiety or terror and pain are
forms of meaning and they're not.

895
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:26,600
They're underneath rationality in a
sense in the rationality is powerless

896
00:58:26,601 --> 00:58:31,601
against terror and pain.
And if you're terrified,

897
00:58:31,701 --> 00:58:33,440
then you'll act that way.
And if you're in pain,

898
00:58:33,441 --> 00:58:36,950
then you'll act that way.
And you might do everything you can to

899
00:58:36,951 --> 00:58:41,090
say there's no such thing as meaning.
But if you're,

900
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:43,290
yeah,

901
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:46,740
b,
if your state of being is one of terror,

902
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:50,820
no matter what you say,
you're going to act like that's real.

903
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,370
And then you have to ask yourself
another question is,

904
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,020
okay,

905
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:00,550
what's more reflective of real,
what you say

906
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:07,640
or how you act
and it matters because what constitutes

907
00:59:08,551 --> 00:59:12,850
real changes with weather?
Like what,

908
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:17,700
what defines real changes?
Or depending on how you answered that

909
00:59:17,701 --> 00:59:22,350
question
and the existentialists

910
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,220
would say,
well,

911
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:27,330
how you act as what's Real,
how you act reflects what's real.

912
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:43,120
But greed played with this a lot.
So there's another painting by me.

913
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:47,640
Greet
you often uses men in suits.

914
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:53,850
Like a suit is representative of a
certain kind of a certain motive being,

915
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:57,930
and it's a mode of being that is focused
on,

916
00:59:57,990 --> 01:00:02,280
it's focused rather narrowly on whatever
a business suit represents.

917
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:05,180
Dominance,
hierarchy,

918
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:07,200
key success,
um,

919
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:09,750
materialistic possessions.
That's the,

920
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:14,310
at least the cliched and satirical
version of business.

921
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:19,460
It certainly represents conformity.
And Magritte migrates painting is a

922
01:00:20,131 --> 01:00:24,210
representation of blindness induced by
conformity.

923
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,160
These people can see,
but they're only seeing what's right in

924
01:00:29,161 --> 01:00:33,060
front of their eyes and what's right in
front of their eyes that they see blocks

925
01:00:33,061 --> 01:00:35,460
them from seeing everything else.
Yes.

926
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:44,530
In there in the first quarter of the
20th century.

927
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:48,060
More like kind of average.

928
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:50,450
Sure.
It's not a,

929
01:00:50,451 --> 01:00:51,350
it's a,
it's,

930
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:54,170
it's conformity essentially.
Yeah.

931
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:55,910
And it's not only that,
it's,

932
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:59,420
it's like it's moral conformity,
you know?

933
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:01,420
I'm not saying that it's right,
it's,

934
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:04,430
it's that it,
it's in the guise of moral conformity.

935
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,020
If you wear a suit,
you're,

936
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:10,340
you're representing what the culture
perceives to be

937
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,220
associated with citizenship and
responsibility.

938
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:31,610
Lot of what [inaudible] did was to try
to dissociate

939
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:35,480
the structure from the underlying
reality.

940
01:01:35,481 --> 01:01:37,070
And he does that.
For example,

941
01:01:37,071 --> 01:01:42,071
in the painting on the right where
he takes any image and then juxtaposes

942
01:01:43,011 --> 01:01:45,680
it with the wrong signifier.

943
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:48,140
Okay.

944
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:51,800
I suppose though in some sense those are
almost like that that painting is almost

945
01:01:51,801 --> 01:01:56,801
like a poem in that the juxtaposition of
the label and the entity forces you to

946
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:05,000
imagine more than either of them would
force you to do alone.

947
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:10,100
Cause you might say,
well in what manner is a horse like a

948
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:14,600
door
and what and what manner is the clock

949
01:02:14,601 --> 01:02:18,800
like the wind
or a picture like a bird?

950
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:26,990
Well and he returns to normal in the
last one and time flies like the wind.

951
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,780
When a horse is something that takes you
places,

952
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:31,980
it's like a door,

953
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,553
a bird.

954
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:38,810
It isn't exactly clear to me how vases
like the bird,

955
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:49,720
this is another dream

956
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:56,510
that's attempting to lay out the same
idea.

957
01:02:57,350 --> 01:03:01,870
So you are what you know,
I believe it's Davinci,

958
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:06,680
the Da Vinci's Vitruvian man,
it's this figure.

959
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:08,990
Presume you've all seen it.
It's very,

960
01:03:08,991 --> 01:03:13,970
very famous image.
So it's the man is in a square and then

961
01:03:13,971 --> 01:03:15,690
the squares in a circle.
Yeah.

962
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:19,220
Um,
in this dream,

963
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:24,980
this dream had that image except the
square wasn't a square,

964
01:03:24,981 --> 01:03:29,030
it was a cube.
So the figure inside the,

965
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:31,970
there was a figure inside the cube,
which was uh,

966
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:35,660
a man,
sort of a generic man or an idealized

967
01:03:35,661 --> 01:03:39,500
man.
And the cube was about nine feet maybe

968
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,870
or eight feet by eight feet by eight
feet.

969
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:45,020
And the man was suspended in the middle
of the cube.

970
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,380
So he was about a foot and a half off
the floor floating.

971
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:49,543
And then

972
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:54,880
from his hands to the wall was about a
foot and a half and

973
01:03:56,650 --> 01:03:59,980
he could reach close to the wall that
was in front of them.

974
01:03:59,981 --> 01:04:04,120
And then the inside of the cube,
no matter where the man looked,

975
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:08,830
was covered with these squares,
with the circle in them.

976
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,950
And inside the circle there was a little
dragon's tail.

977
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:14,770
And if the man walked forward,
then the cube went with them.

978
01:04:14,771 --> 01:04:16,780
And if the man walked backwards,
the cube went with them.

979
01:04:16,781 --> 01:04:21,250
And so it was a representation of what
surrounds you in reality.

980
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:27,160
And then the man could reach out to any
of these squares with the circle,

981
01:04:27,161 --> 01:04:30,340
with the tail,
and he can pull on one of the tails and

982
01:04:30,341 --> 01:04:34,960
that would pull something into being.
And there were all these choices in

983
01:04:34,961 --> 01:04:38,860
front of him that represented different
paths of being.

984
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:43,000
So.
So what that dream represented was this,

985
01:04:43,001 --> 01:04:43,781
you know,
you might say,

986
01:04:43,781 --> 01:04:45,790
well,
what is it?

987
01:04:45,850 --> 01:04:49,060
It's right in front of you.
And then you could say,

988
01:04:49,061 --> 01:04:54,061
well,
chairs and the floor and students and

989
01:04:57,390 --> 01:05:00,060
light.
And

990
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:04,370
that's true.
But there's another way of thinking

991
01:05:04,371 --> 01:05:07,100
about it,
which is that what's right in front of

992
01:05:07,101 --> 01:05:12,101
you is a landscape of possibility to
which your conception of objects blind

993
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:17,763
you.

994
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:20,163
So

995
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:25,080
no matter where you're going in your
life,

996
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:28,530
the things that present themselves to
you,

997
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:30,060
okay.

998
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:33,780
Offer an array of almost unlimited
possibility.

999
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:39,320
And so when I look ahead and I see a
student or students,

1000
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:45,080
then that makes all of you one bit of
information in a sense,

1001
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:50,460
right?
Because I've generalized across all of

1002
01:05:50,461 --> 01:05:54,540
you and there's some utility in that,
in that

1003
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:57,403
part of

1004
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:01,900
what you're doing here can be
conceptualized as being a student.

1005
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:07,710
But the loss in that perception might be
far greater than the gain because it

1006
01:06:09,761 --> 01:06:14,761
reduces all of your complexity to a
single utterance and makes you flat.

1007
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:19,720
And so then you think as you wander
around the world,

1008
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:26,190
are you seeing
this

1009
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:33,680
or are you seeing a wall in front of you
that from which you can pull anything

1010
01:06:34,561 --> 01:06:39,561
you want,
that the standard viewpoint would be

1011
01:06:40,501 --> 01:06:45,501
that this is real.
But it seems to me that you can make a

1012
01:06:48,761 --> 01:06:53,620
reasonable case that what you interact
with is not so much reality as it is

1013
01:06:53,621 --> 01:06:58,621
possibility.
And so the possibility is what lurks

1014
01:06:59,051 --> 01:07:04,051
behind your conception of what's there.
And that possibility is also the thing

1015
01:07:04,391 --> 01:07:06,490
out of which everything emerges.
So if I,

1016
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:12,210
if you come to my office and I sit and
talk to you and I

1017
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:19,300
try to approach you without any
preconceptions which would be saying a

1018
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:24,301
Rogerian approach,
then all sorts of things can emerge into

1019
01:07:24,941 --> 01:07:29,500
reality.
That wouldn't emerge at all if I stayed

1020
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:34,360
rigidly in a prescribed role.
Now there's some utility in the

1021
01:07:34,361 --> 01:07:36,760
prescribed role,
don't get me wrong because it gives

1022
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:40,840
people structure and it and it,
it helps to manage their expectations

1023
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:45,250
and it protects them from being exposed
to too much possibility at any one time

1024
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:49,450
because that can be overwhelming.
But the danger is,

1025
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:54,370
at least in part that you'll blind
yourself to all the things that are

1026
01:07:54,371 --> 01:07:59,371
there by only allowing yourself to see
what you can immediately see.

1027
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,500
The Buddhists talk about desire as
something to

1028
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,450
push aside,
and I think that's

1029
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:16,180
okay.
There.

1030
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:21,180
Attempt to warn people about the danger
of substituting their own preconceptions

1031
01:08:22,671 --> 01:08:27,520
about what should be or what is
four,

1032
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:32,530
four attention to what's behind that.
So imagine that you're depressed and

1033
01:08:36,401 --> 01:08:41,110
your board and all the positive meaning
has gone out of your life.

1034
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:47,980
Well perhaps it's because you've
substituted your a Priori perceptions

1035
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:55,300
for possibility and you're in this cage
that that's in part a mirror and all it

1036
01:08:56,781 --> 01:09:00,920
does is reflect back to you your sterile
preconceptions.

1037
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:07,210
Well behind that is the possibility and
it's conceivable in that possibility,

1038
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:14,230
which is maybe infinite possibility that
what it is that you lack now that's

1039
01:09:15,231 --> 01:09:20,231
making you so rigid and board could be
pulled out of that possibility.

1040
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:40,240
Boss said man's option to respond to
this claim or to choose not to,

1041
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,430
not to do so seems to be the very core
of human freedom.

1042
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:02,480
All right,
so I'm going to return to a theme that I

1043
01:10:02,481 --> 01:10:04,490
developed partway through this lecture.

1044
01:10:09,730 --> 01:10:10,563
Yeah.

1045
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,690
If being doesn't manifest itself to you
as structured,

1046
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,990
then it's as if you're falling
endlessly.

1047
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:24,740
It needs structure
is like a set of tools that that you

1048
01:10:26,091 --> 01:10:28,100
have at your disposal.
Now

1049
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:34,450
the problem with structures that it can
blind you to possibility

1050
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,870
and the possibility might be more
important than the structure.

1051
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:43,010
And that means that partly what you have
to do is balance the possibility and the

1052
01:10:43,011 --> 01:10:48,011
structure.
One possibility is that the things that

1053
01:10:50,311 --> 01:10:55,311
manifest themselves to you as meaningful
are constituted gateway between

1054
01:10:57,090 --> 01:11:02,090
structure and possibility so that if you
follow that which shines forth,

1055
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:07,350
then you stay sufficiently within the
structure.

1056
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:13,040
But at the same time you're pulling in
enough new possibility so that the stays

1057
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:18,360
dynamic and alive instead of static and
dead.

1058
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,900
If if your nervous system,
Huh,

1059
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:30,020
if you pay attention to the cues that
being is offering you,

1060
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:34,580
showing you where to look and you are
actually look,

1061
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:40,200
then maybe you can stay flexible enough
so that as things shift around you,

1062
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:45,680
you don't
grow a huge gap between yourself and the

1063
01:11:45,681 --> 01:11:47,570
world and fall.

1064
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:49,723
Maybe you just

1065
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:54,390
interact,
you know,

1066
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:58,690
like in a dance that's,
that's acceptable

1067
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:03,440
emotional significance.
It's,

1068
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:08,490
it's anxiety provoking enough to keep
you awake and it's compelling enough to

1069
01:12:09,461 --> 01:12:12,820
keep you interested.
And so those two things in some sense

1070
01:12:12,821 --> 01:12:15,940
constitute the core of meaning.

1071
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:21,943
Okay.

1072
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:25,800
In order to interact with the world in
that way,

1073
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:30,330
you have to flip your preconceptions
upside down

1074
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:37,040
and make the presupposition that the
material elements that people,

1075
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:43,700
modern people regard as most real are
actually secondary and limited

1076
01:12:44,491 --> 01:12:48,270
derivations of something that's more
fundamental.

1077
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,700
And the thing that's more fundamental is
possibility and possibility shines

1078
01:12:53,701 --> 01:12:58,170
through structure with meaning.
That's the phenomenal logical

1079
01:12:58,171 --> 01:13:03,171
perspective and the existential
perspective is follow that meaning or

1080
01:13:03,241 --> 01:13:04,590
suffer the consequences.

1081
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,153
That's that.

1082
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,030
See you Thursday.
