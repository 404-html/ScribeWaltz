Hello Am I Korean readers main fund,
my publisher.

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,080
I'm sitting here in Maui,
Hawaii,

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,303
taking a bit of a break from my tour and
I just received word that sales of 12 

4
00:00:16,931 --> 00:00:19,960
rules for life and Korea are approaching
the hundred thousand mark.

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,450
So I'm extremely gratified to hear that.
Um,

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,610
I'm a great admirer of South Korean 
culture.

7
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:28,743
I think that what you,
you're people have managed in the last 

8
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:34,264
40 years is nothing short of a miracle.
And I'm filled with admiration for your 

9
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:40,744
accomplishments.
I would really hope that the 12 rules 

10
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:48,370
for life can help your people,
young,

11
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,510
young,
and old alike,

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,873
and encourage them to develop a 
compelling vision for their life and to 

13
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,103
take on the sort of responsibility that 
you've been pastors at managing and to 

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,080
speak honestly and forthrightly and to 
live knowably and to bury your suffering

15
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:09,640
properly and to help make the world a 
better and less of place.

16
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,510
And so,
um,

17
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,693
thank you for all your support so far 
and I hope at some point to be able to 

18
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:19,450
come to your country and perhaps talk to
you.

19
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,770
Thanks very much Dr. Jordan Peterson.

20
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,223
Bye Bye.
