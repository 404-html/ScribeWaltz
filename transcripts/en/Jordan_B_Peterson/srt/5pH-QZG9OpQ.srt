1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,753
Well
you might as well start by writing down 

2
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:09,044
that url.
I'll show it to you again at the end of 

3
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:15,410
class.
That's where the syllabus is.

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,443
The syllabus will tell you pretty much 
everything you need to know about the 

5
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:22,400
class.
The,

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,860
there's a text,
this is it.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,310
It consists of readings from a larger 
text.

8
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:33,763
I use it because it's old,
but a lot of the theorists that we're 

9
00:00:37,581 --> 00:00:41,150
going to talk about
are also old.

10
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,493
And so I found this particular text 
accurate and many of the people that 

11
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:52,820
we're going to talk about
are very,

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,440
uh,
very sophisticated views of personality.

13
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,383
And I think that it does you a 
disservice unless you read something 

14
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:09,641
that's sufficiently sophisticated so 
that you actually understand at least to

15
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:14,510
some degree what the people that were 
going to study,

16
00:01:14,511 --> 00:01:19,400
we're talking about,
we might as well start,

17
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:23,060
I suppose with a definition of 
personality,

18
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,070
it's hard to define something that's 
that general because

19
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,503
when you're speaking about human beings,
it's not that simple to figure out what 

20
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:38,230
constitutes personality and what 
constitutes something else.

21
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,143
But
so I'm going to hit at it from a couple 

22
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:45,304
of different perspectives.
And while I'm doing so I would like you 

23
00:01:50,591 --> 00:01:51,670
also to consider

24
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,000
the nature of what you're going to 
learn.

25
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,050
Human personality is essentially 
unfathomable.

26
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,383
Human beings are unbelievably 
complicated and and we're nested in 

27
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:09,070
systems that are also unbelievably 
complicated.

28
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,470
There are more patterns of connections 
between neurons in your brain.

29
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:18,400
Then there are sub atomic particles in 
the universe by a substantial margin.

30
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,600
You can look up Gerald Edelman if you 
want to find out about that.

31
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,543
And so it's not unreasonable to point 
out that you're the most complicated 

32
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:31,144
thing we know of by many orders of 
magnitude and the probability that you 

33
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:38,344
can understand yourself in anything 
approaching totality is extraordinarily 

34
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:44,014
low.
So this makes the study of personality 

35
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:53,091
something very
daring and hopeless and complicated.

36
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,980
Now we're to cycle through a

37
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,813
very large number of theorists.
And what you'll find is that although 

38
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,870
there are commonalities between them,
there are market differences.

39
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,460
And so then you might ask yourself,
well,

40
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,000
what's the point of studying this 
sequence of theorists and ideas?

41
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,390
If there's no point of agreement between
them.

42
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,313
Now,
I would say first there are points of 

43
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:27,394
agreement between them.
Although personality hasn't advanced to 

44
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:32,614
the point where I would say that we have
a homogenous theory that's free of 

45
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:41,440
internal contradictions.
But I would also say that

46
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,200
personality is a hybrid discipline.
It's partly science

47
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,563
but it's partly engineering.
The clinical element of it I would say 

48
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,174
is more like engineering.
And what engineers do is try to do 

49
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,114
things.
They tried to make something happen and 

50
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:04,324
they are informed by theory,
but the point is still to build 

51
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:08,344
something.
And when you're working as a clinical 

52
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:11,644
psychologist and most of the initial 
theorists that we'll discuss for the 

53
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:18,730
first little more than a third to a half
of the chorus or clinical theorists,

54
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,190
they're trying to build something and 
they're dealing with very,

55
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:28,360
very difficult
conceptual problems because

56
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,623
they're either trying to cure mental 
disorders or maybe even unhappiness and 

57
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:37,264
trying to bring about health.
And the problem with that is that it's 

58
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:43,024
not a straight forward thing to define a
mental disorder from a scientific 

59
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:51,751
perspective because what's healthy 
mentally and what's not is partly social

60
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:59,401
judgment.
And it's partly socially constructed and

61
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:00,484
it partly has to do with norms.
And it partly has to do with ideals 

62
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:08,890
because you might also say that to be 
healthy is to be normal,

63
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,490
but you could also say that to be 
healthy is to be ideal.

64
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,983
And then of course you run into the 
problem of having to conceptualize an 

65
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:22,471
ideal and it isn't self evident that 
science is capable of conceptualizing an

66
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:30,691
ideal because ideals tend to fall into 
the domain of moral judgments,

67
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,773
say,
or philosophical judgements rather than 

68
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:37,360
scientific judgements per se.

69
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,003
So what I would say to you is that
it would be worthwhile to approach this 

70
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:51,150
course as if you were an engineer of the
human spirit,

71
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,350
an engineer of your own spirit to begin 
with,

72
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,380
but also an engineer of the spirits of 
other people.

73
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,590
Because as you interact with other 
people,

74
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,470
you inevitably tell them what you want 
and what you don't want.

75
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,930
When they give you what you want
and what you admire,

76
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:17,930
you respond positively to them.
You pay attention to them,

77
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:20,270
you smile at them,
you focus,

78
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,750
you focus your thoughts on them,
you interact with them.

79
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,470
Then you reward them for acting in a 
particular manner.

80
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,610
And when they don't respond the way that
you want,

81
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,743
then you punish them with a lock or by 
turning away or by rejecting their 

82
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:40,970
friendship or when were a child by 
refusing to play for them,

83
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,953
play with them and so
we're engaged in the co creation of 

84
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,493
personalities,
our own and others and that also brings 

85
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,124
up the same question,
what is it that we are all collectively 

86
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,500
trying to be
and trying to create?

87
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,973
I suspect that you all have the 
experience of falling short of the 

88
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:11,564
ideal,
an ideal that you hold for yourself or 

89
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:19,691
an ideal that other people hold for you.
I suspect that you all feel the negative

90
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:23,300
consequences of falling short of that 
ideal.

91
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,233
Freud would conceptualize that as the 
superego imposing its judgment on the 

92
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:33,980
ego,
you being ego,

93
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,370
the superego being
a hybrid I suppose of

94
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,123
external external forces and also your 
internalization of those judgments and 

95
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:54,481
forces.
Now personality per se I would say

96
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,203
has these elements of ideal and how 
structural elements of oil as well and 

97
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,700
we're going to talk about those more in 
the second half of the class.

98
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:15,390
The structural elements can be lined up 
and outlined more scientifically.

99
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,140
The second half of the cow class 
concentrates more on

100
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,713
physiology,
brain physiology and on statistical 

101
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:27,330
approaches to the description of 
personality.

102
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:28,963
Um,
I suppose you might say that that 

103
00:08:30,421 --> 00:08:31,650
outlines the territory.

104
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,590
The course is called personality and its
transformations because

105
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,820
we have personalities.
That's who you are now.

106
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,450
But our personalities are also capable 
of transformation of change.

107
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,420
I mean obviously we think about that is 
learning.

108
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:52,943
Um,
some of that might be regarded as 

109
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,950
factual learning and some of it might be
regarded as learning how to perceive and

110
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:03,624
behave.
And I would say that the clinical 

111
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,490
psychologists that will cover to begin 
with

112
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,003
are much more concerned with the nature 
of the implicit structures that shape 

113
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:24,231
your perceptions and also the implicit 
structures that shape your behaviors and

114
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:31,851
how they're integrated in relationship 
to your negative emotion,

115
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,623
health and wellbeing.
Whereas the thinkers in the second half 

116
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,203
are more concerned about laying out the 
structural elements of those features 

117
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:47,760
and relating them to underlying say,
mechanistic phenomena,

118
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,480
making the assumption which seems 
warranted,

119
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:56,190
that there's some relationship between 
your personality and the manner in which

120
00:09:56,191 --> 00:09:57,150
your brain functions.

121
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,723
I'm going to try to provide you with a 
Meta narrative that will help you unite 

122
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:07,014
these different theories.
I've often found it useful when I'm 

123
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:14,130
trying to remember something to have a 
story to hang the fact on.

124
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,323
Otherwise you're faced with the 
necessity of doing nothing but 

125
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:18,234
memorization.
And it isn't obvious to me that 

126
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,620
memorization actually constitutes 
knowledge.

127
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,993
Um,
what constitutes knowledge is that 

128
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,993
generation of a cognitive structure that
enables you to conduct yourself more 

129
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,373
appropriately in life.
And so I suppose you might say that of 

130
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:41,910
course in psychology you could argue 
that of course in psychology,

131
00:10:41,911 --> 00:10:45,990
especially in personality is of course 
in applied wisdom as well.

132
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,243
Assuming that wisdom is in part your 
capacity to understand yourselves so 

133
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:56,340
that you don't,
so that you don't present too much of an

134
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:57,174
intolerable mystery to yourself.
And also to understand others so that 

135
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:06,951
you can predict their behavior,
understand their motivations,

136
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,660
and negotiate with them,
listen to them and formulate joint games

137
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:15,264
with them so that you can integrate 
yourself reasonably well with another 

138
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:23,670
person,
with a family and in society.

139
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,863
Well,
the structural elements of personality 

140
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:30,814
might be regarded as the implicit 
structures that govern your perception 

141
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,360
and that tilt you towards certain kinds 
of behaviors.

142
00:11:40,361 --> 00:11:41,194
I can give you some examples.
We can talk about the big five model 

143
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:45,244
just briefly.

144
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,780
The big five personality model is a 
statistical model,

145
00:11:49,781 --> 00:11:54,781
which we'll cover in detail,
trained by trait there partly during the

146
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:55,684
second half of the course.
The way that the big five was generated 

147
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:00,304
was that it's stretton being generated 
over about 50 years that personality 

148
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:06,544
psychologists gathered together 
adjectives within the English language 

149
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,104
first that were used to describe human 
beings as many adjectives as they could 

150
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:21,190
collect and then subjected them to a 
process called factor analysis.

151
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:22,024
And what factor analysis does is enable 
you statistically to determine in some 

152
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:28,750
sense how similar adjectives are to one 
another.

153
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:29,650
So,
for example,

154
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,323
if you gave a thousand people a list of 
adjectives to describe themselves with 

155
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:42,580
and one of the adjectives was happy and 
another of the adjectives was social,

156
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:48,030
you'd find that those who rated 
themselves high on happy would also rate

157
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:49,264
themselves high on social.
And those who rated themselves low on 

158
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,670
happy would also rate themselves low on 
social.

159
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,360
And by looking at those patterns of 
Covariation,

160
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:03,190
you can determine what the essential 
dimensions are of human personality.

161
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,720
One of the dimensions is roughly 
happiness.

162
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,400
That's extroversion.
Another dimension is neuroticism.

163
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:18,090
It's a negative emotion dimension.
So if you ask someone if they're anxious

164
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,640
and they score high,
say on a scale of one to seven,

165
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:26,710
they're also likely to score high on 
another item that says that they're sad.

166
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,700
And it turns out that negative emotions 
clump together.

167
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,563
And so that people who experience more 
of one negative emotion have a 

168
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:37,360
propensity to experience more of all of 
them.

169
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,840
There's another dimension called 
agreeableness.

170
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,070
And agreeable people are self 
sacrificing,

171
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,113
compassionate and polite.
If you're dealing with an agreeable 

172
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:51,640
person,
they don't like conflict,

173
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,140
they care for other people.
Um,

174
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,070
if you're dealing with an agreeable 
person,

175
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,850
they're likely to put your concerns 
ahead of theirs.

176
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,610
They are non competitive and 
cooperative.

177
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,433
It's a dimension where women are women 
score more highly than men on 

178
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,473
agreeableness across cultures including 
those cultures where the largest steps 

179
00:14:14,951 --> 00:14:15,784
have been taken towards producing an 
egalitarian social circumstance like 

180
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:19,714
Scandinavia.
Actually the gender differences in 

181
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:24,220
personality there are larger than they 
are anywhere else.

182
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,630
Um,
another trait is conscientiousness.

183
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,350
Conscientiousness is an excellent trait 
if you want to do well in,

184
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:33,903
in school and in work,
especially if you're a manager and 

185
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:36,903
administrator.
I can't say we understand a lot about 

186
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:41,320
conscientiousness,
although it,

187
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,633
it reliably emerges from factor analytic
studies of adjective groups across 

188
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:49,030
different countries.
Conscientious people are diligent,

189
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:49,923
industrious and orderly.
Their orderliness tilts them towards 

190
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:53,864
political conservatism by the way,
because it turns out that your inbuilt 

191
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,850
temperament,
your inbuilt personality,

192
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,073
which constitutes a set of filters 
through which you view the world also 

193
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,563
alters the manner in which you process 
information and influences the way that 

194
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:11,720
you vote.
And so you might say,

195
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,913
and I do believe that this is true,
are we've been doing a lot of research 

196
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,220
on this as of late.

197
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,710
The more accurate a measure you take of 
someone's political beliefs,

198
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,280
the more you find that personality is 
what's predicting them.

199
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,150
And I think that's a reasonable thing to
think about because you know,

200
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,913
you have to,
you have to figure out ways of 

201
00:15:33,271 --> 00:15:34,740
simplifying the world,
right?

202
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:38,580
Because you just can't do everything.
And so people are specialized,

203
00:15:38,581 --> 00:15:41,820
they have specialized niches that they 
occupy and you could think about them as

204
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:44,850
social niches.
A niche is a place where your particular

205
00:15:44,851 --> 00:15:49,440
skills would serve to maintain you.
And so if you're extroverted,

206
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,340
you're going to look for a social niche 
because you like to be around people.

207
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,383
And if you're introverted,
you're going to spend much more time on 

208
00:15:55,861 --> 00:15:57,840
your own.
And so if you're an introverted person,

209
00:15:57,841 --> 00:15:58,674
for example,
you're going to want a job where you're 

210
00:16:01,651 --> 00:16:02,484
not selling and where you're not 
surrounded by groups of people who are 

211
00:16:04,801 --> 00:16:07,590
making social demands on you all the 
time because it will wear you out.

212
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,980
Whereas if you're extroverted,
that's just exactly what you want.

213
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,413
And so the extrovert sees the world as a
place of social opportunity and the 

214
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:20,370
introverts sees the world as a place to 
retreat from and spend time alone.

215
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,710
And it turns out that both of those 
modes of being are valid.

216
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,750
The issue,
at least to some degree,

217
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:28,584
is whether or not you're fortunate 
enough to match your temperament with 

218
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:33,234
the demands of the environment.
And I suppose also whether you're 

219
00:16:35,191 --> 00:16:36,024
fortunate enough,
fortunate enough so that you're born in 

220
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:39,444
an era where there actually is a niche 
for your particular temperament because 

221
00:16:42,661 --> 00:16:45,630
it isn't necessarily the case that that 
will be the case.

222
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,793
Imagine that all of these temperamental 
dimensions very because of evolutionary 

223
00:16:51,571 --> 00:16:52,680
pressure,
right?

224
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:54,630
So there's a distribution of 
extroversion,

225
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,480
a normal distribution.
Most people are somewhere in the middle.

226
00:16:57,481 --> 00:16:59,730
And then as you go out towards the 
extremes,

227
00:16:59,731 --> 00:17:00,564
there are fewer and fewer people.
And what that means is that on average 

228
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,213
across large spans of time,
there have been environments that match 

229
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,870
every single position on that 
distribution with most,

230
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,060
most of the environments matching the 
center.

231
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:15,923
Because otherwise we wouldn't have 
evolved that way and so sometimes being 

232
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:22,860
really extroverted is going to work well
for you in a minority of environments,

233
00:17:22,861 --> 00:17:26,130
a minority of niches and sometimes it's 
just going to be a catastrophe.

234
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:30,750
I suspect for example,
that if you live in a tyrannical society

235
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,360
where any sign of

236
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,740
of,
of,

237
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,723
of

238
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,720
personally oriented activity is likely 
to get you in trouble,

239
00:17:39,721 --> 00:17:44,190
that being extroverted and low in 
neuroticism wouldn't be a very good idea

240
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,053
because you're going to be mouthy and 
happy and saying a lot of things unable 

241
00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:51,570
to keep your thoughts yourself and 
you're going to be relatively fearless.

242
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,493
Now I don't know that for sure because 
we haven't done the studies that 

243
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:59,070
precisely match temperamental proclivity
to environmental demand,

244
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,340
but you get what I mean,
so conscientious people anyways,

245
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:09,090
conscientious people are industrious and
orderly.

246
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:09,983
We know a little bit about orderliness.
It seems to be associated strangely 

247
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:17,430
enough with disgust sensitivity,
which I suppose isn't that surprising.

248
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:18,264
You know,
if you take an orderly person and you 

249
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:20,784
put them in a messy kitchen,
they respond with disgust and want 

250
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,780
nothing more than to straighten it all 
out and organize it and clean it.

251
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,450
And there's tremendous variability in 
orderliness.

252
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,330
Um,
and as I said,

253
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:35,340
orderliness predicts political 
conservatism.

254
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:37,650
It's not the only thing,
but it's certainly one of the things.

255
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,443
MMM.

256
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,530
The correlation between 
conscientiousness and grades,

257
00:18:45,531 --> 00:18:49,310
it's about 0.4.
It's about 16% of the variance.

258
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,383
It's,
it's the second best predictor of 

259
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:55,310
university grades after intelligence.
And we'll talk about intelligence during

260
00:18:55,311 --> 00:18:59,870
this course to intelligence is actually 
a relatively straightforward concept.

261
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,070
I don't think I'll get into it today,
but conscientious people,

262
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,993
their industriousness and their 
orderliness makes them schedule their 

263
00:19:07,251 --> 00:19:09,650
time so they make efficient use of their
time.

264
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:11,390
They use schedules and that sort of 
thing.

265
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,800
We haven't been able to figure out 
anything about the underlying biology or

266
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:17,850
psychology of industriousness.
We've,

267
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,793
we've tried really dozens and dozens of 
tests attempting to find a laboratory 

268
00:19:24,861 --> 00:19:27,260
measure on which industrious people do 
better.

269
00:19:27,261 --> 00:19:28,094
And we failed completely.
And there's no animal models of 

270
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:30,914
industriousness either.
And so I would say it's great mystery 

271
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,720
that remains at the heart of trade 
psychology.

272
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,093
Um,
and maybe it's a human specific 

273
00:19:38,631 --> 00:19:39,560
category,
you know,

274
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:40,394
I mean,
you can think of sled dogs maybe of 

275
00:19:41,901 --> 00:19:42,734
being industrious and maybe and maybe 
sheep dogs and animals that work like 

276
00:19:45,741 --> 00:19:46,574
that,
but of course they've been trained by 

277
00:19:47,181 --> 00:19:47,870
human beings.

278
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:48,703
So,
but it isn't obvious that animals are 

279
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:53,900
industrious the same way we are.
I mean,

280
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,980
industriousness involves sacrificing the
present for the future,

281
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,760
something like that.
And it seems like you have to be able to

282
00:20:01,761 --> 00:20:05,540
conceptualize time in order to sacrifice
the present for the future.

283
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,910
One of the things that I would recommend
that you do as students,

284
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,820
um,
in this course and maybe in every course

285
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:18,730
speaking of industriousness is come up 
with a plan of attack for the course and

286
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,100
use a scheduler.
You know,

287
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,230
if you treat your university career like
a full time job,

288
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,573
you're much more likely to succeed.
And if you keep up on the readings and 

289
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:32,480
you keep up on the,
on the essays and all of that,

290
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:33,703
then you're much less likely as well to 
fall into despair when you get too far 

291
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:38,804
behind.
Using a google calendar or something 

292
00:20:40,731 --> 00:20:41,564
like that to organize a schedule for the
entire semester at the beginning of the 

293
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:46,454
semester can be invaluable,
especially if you're not very 

294
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:52,270
industriousness,
very industrious because it can keep you

295
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:52,900
on track.

296
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,380
And one of the things we know about 
industrious people is that they are very

297
00:20:56,381 --> 00:21:00,190
good at using schedules and it planning 
the use of their time.

298
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,850
And so I would like to say that you 
should all be smarter,

299
00:21:03,851 --> 00:21:05,710
but I don't know how you could be 
smarter.

300
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,860
We don't know anything about how to 
improve intelligence.

301
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:09,694
And I suppose we don't really know 
anything about how to improve 

302
00:21:11,891 --> 00:21:12,724
industriousness either.
But I can tell you that people who are 

303
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:20,131
industrious come up with a strategy for 
solving the problem that's ahead of them

304
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:23,260
and then they do whatever they can to 
stick to the strategy.

305
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:24,094
And so for example,
if you sat down today or tomorrow for a 

306
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,523
couple of hours,
three hours and you filled in a google 

307
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:32,134
calendar,
whatever you happen to use with a 

308
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,713
strategy for studying and a list of when
all your assignments are due and all of 

309
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:39,574
that,
and when you're going to sit down and 

310
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:42,004
study,
then you won't be in a position where 

311
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:44,764
you have to cram for 10 hours a day 
hopelessly right before you know an 

312
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:49,840
important exam.

313
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,270
It's also a very ineffective way of 
studying.

314
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:53,500
By the way,
I'm being,

315
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:55,990
first of all,
people who cram for 10 hours say they're

316
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:58,300
studying for 10 hours,
but they rarely are because,

317
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,740
well,
I can't study for 10 hours.

318
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:06,400
I don't have the power of concentration 
that would enable me to do that for that

319
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:07,234
prolonged period of time.
I can manage about three hours of 

320
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:10,354
intense intellectual activity before I'm
pretty done and it's also the case that 

321
00:22:14,891 --> 00:22:15,724
if you study and then sleep and then 
study and then sleep and then study and 

322
00:22:18,341 --> 00:22:19,810
then sleep,
you space it out,

323
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,090
then you're much more likely to 
remember.

324
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,613
It's also much more likely that you're 
much more likely to remember if you try 

325
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:27,334
to recall the material.
And so highlighting in that sort of 

326
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:31,900
thing isn't very useful.
But reading,

327
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,913
closing the book,
summarizing what you've read without 

328
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:38,050
opening the damn book,
that's useful.

329
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,423
And the reason for that is that you're 
practicing remembering and that's what 

330
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:45,670
you have to practice.
If you're practicing memorization,

331
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:46,504
you have to practice remembering.
You don't just go over the thing over 

332
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:50,314
and over.
That'll help you with recognition 

333
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:53,170
memory,
but some,

334
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,790
but it won't help you with recall 
memory.

335
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,670
Anyways,
the last trade is openness.

336
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,133
Openness is a creativity trait.
It's also associated with intelligence 

337
00:23:02,471 --> 00:23:05,500
in that intelligent people,
and I'm speaking technically of Iq,

338
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:09,370
tend to be higher in,
tend to be more creative,

339
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,263
which is hardly surprising.
Creative people are more likely to be 

340
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:16,210
liberal politically by the way.
Um,

341
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,210
they like novelty.
They like aesthetics,

342
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:21,640
they like fiction,
they like movies,

343
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:23,350
they like,
are they like poetry?

344
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,750
There's something about them that grants
them.

345
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,040
Anesthetic sensitivity and,
and that's,

346
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:33,610
uh,
that's an inbuilt trait and it's not the

347
00:23:33,611 --> 00:23:35,500
case by the way,
that everyone's creative.

348
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,620
In fact,
far from it.

349
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,493
Ah,
we've used the creative achievement 

350
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:42,100
questionnaire to you measure people's 
creativity.

351
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,960
I'll talk to you about that later in the
class.

352
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,243
And the creative achievement 
questionnaire takes 13 dimensions of 

353
00:23:48,381 --> 00:23:49,910
creativity.
So you know,

354
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,170
writing,
dancing,

355
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,960
acting,
scientific investigation,

356
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:57,230
entrepreneurial activity,
architectural activity,

357
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,060
cooking,
um,

358
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,310
there's a,
there's a handful of others,

359
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,810
singing,
et Cetera,

360
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,733
you know,
the sorts of things that you would 

361
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,560
assume that people could be creative 
about.

362
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:07,394
And then it asks people to rate 
themselves on a scale from one to 10 on 

363
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:16,070
their level of achievement with regards 
to all those creative domains.

364
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:16,904
With zero being,
I have no training or proficiency in 

365
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:20,834
this area,
and 70% of people score zero across the 

366
00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:25,760
entire creative achievement 
questionnaire.

367
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,480
A tiny proportion of people are outliers
way out.

368
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,443
They're creative in many dimensions 
simultaneously and exceptionally 

369
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:36,020
creative.
And it turns out as you'll find out that

370
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:38,360
that pattern,
which is called a prieto distribution,

371
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:39,194
where most people stack up at zero and a
few people are way out on the creative 

372
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:44,204
end,
characterizes all sorts of 

373
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:47,990
distributions,
like the distribution of money,

374
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:48,913
for example,
which is why 1% of the people have the 

375
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:54,890
overwhelming majority of the money.

376
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,570
It's a different 1% across time.
It he'd like it churns,

377
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,960
and you're much more likely to be in the
1% if you're older,

378
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,513
logically enough,
because one of the things you do as you 

379
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,760
age is you trade youth for money.
If you're fortunate,

380
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,160
I don't think the trade is really worth 
it,

381
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:16,490
but that's the best you've got.
So anyways,

382
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:17,983
those particular traits,
you can think of those as ways that you 

383
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:22,400
simplify the world,
right?

384
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,563
There's lots of different places that 
you can act in the world and there's 

385
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:29,390
lots of different ways you can look at 
it and survive.

386
00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:32,870
That's why you can be a plumber and a 
lawyer and an engineer,

387
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,490
and they,
those all work,

388
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,440
right?
Even though they're very different modes

389
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:37,274
of being and you can have different 
personalities and survive as long as 

390
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:42,314
you're capable of finding the place 
where your particular filters and 

391
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:50,660
behavioral proclivities match the demand
of the environment.

392
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:55,520
And a huge part I would say of 
successful adaptation is precisely that.

393
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,550
Are there other elements of personality 
too?

394
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,130
One of the things that I've been struck 
by,

395
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,023
and this is actually one of the 
criticisms I have of the psychoanalysts 

396
00:26:05,121 --> 00:26:05,954
and the clinicians in general,
even though I have great admiration for 

397
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:09,224
them and would say that what they have 
to say is very much worth listening to 

398
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,180
is that it's not obvious that your 
personality is inside you.

399
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,293
You know,
you think you know a human being is a 

400
00:26:21,631 --> 00:26:25,040
strange multilevel thing and you might 
ask yourself,

401
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,020
well for example,
no,

402
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:32,230
is your mother more a part of you then 
your arm or maybe even more precisely,

403
00:26:32,781 --> 00:26:36,020
is your child more a part of you then 
your arm?

404
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,423
It's certainly people will do 
drastically self sacrificing things to 

405
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:44,490
maintain the lives of their children.
And so you're,

406
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,710
you're a person and you're made out of 
all sub,

407
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,110
sort of subcomponents of,
of a person,

408
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:51,390
none of which you can see when you look 
at a person,

409
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,930
all the complicated machinery inside you
that makes you who you are.

410
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,763
And then outside of that,
of course he are nested in all sorts of 

411
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:01,830
complex systems.
So you're part of a family and,

412
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,590
and you're part of a community and 
that's part of a province.

413
00:27:04,591 --> 00:27:05,424
And that's part of a state.
And that's part of an international 

414
00:27:08,011 --> 00:27:10,500
consortium of states.
And that's part of an ecosystem.

415
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:15,501
And how you make a distinction between 
you and the systems that you're embedded

416
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:20,900
in is also an extraordinary difficulty.
And,

417
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,113
and,
and in one of the things that you have 

418
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,960
to do as a clinical psychologist,
for example,

419
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:27,090
if you're trying to diagnose someone 
with depression,

420
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,680
is that you think,
well,

421
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,200
this person's dreadfully unhappy.
Well,

422
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:35,340
you can think about that as a problem 
with their psychological adjustment.

423
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:36,620
You know,
the way that they're learning,

424
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,483
looking at the world.
But if you look at the epidemiological 

425
00:27:41,581 --> 00:27:42,840
literature,
for example,

426
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,320
one of the things that you find is that 
very many people have a first depressive

427
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:52,290
episode after something genuinely 
terrible has happened to them,

428
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,573
right?
They've lost someone or they've become 

429
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:59,160
injured or or they've become unemployed 
because unemployment is a terrible shock

430
00:27:59,161 --> 00:27:59,994
to people and it's not precisely self 
evident that you can consider someone 

431
00:28:04,231 --> 00:28:09,030
who's unhappy and desperate because they
no longer have a job depressed.

432
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,630
They're certainly sad and they're not 
doing very well,

433
00:28:13,631 --> 00:28:14,464
but the fact that they no longer have an
income is actually something with 

434
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,623
dramatic practical consequences and 
treating that as if it's a mental 

435
00:28:23,681 --> 00:28:28,681
disorder seems to be counter productive.
It's also the case for example,

436
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:32,620
that if you're,
if someone comes into you to talk to you

437
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,640
and they're very upset and they may 
manifest the signs of say,

438
00:28:36,641 --> 00:28:37,474
an anxiety disorder or again,
depression or or other other clinical 

439
00:28:40,931 --> 00:28:41,764
features for that matter,
you have to do a careful analysis of 

440
00:28:45,161 --> 00:28:47,860
their manner in which they're embedded 
in their family.

441
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:48,694
Because,
and this is something that we'll talk 

442
00:28:50,171 --> 00:28:51,004
about quite

443
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,270
thoroughly when we come to discussing 
Freud,

444
00:28:55,271 --> 00:28:56,230
is that,
well,

445
00:28:56,231 --> 00:28:57,064
you know,
it's not like everybody's families are 

446
00:28:58,141 --> 00:29:00,700
necessarily particularly happy places to
be.

447
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,773
You know,
I mean,

448
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,733
human beings are very dependent.
We have a very long period of 

449
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:08,710
dependency,
partly because we're so cortically hyper

450
00:29:08,711 --> 00:29:09,544
developed.
It takes a very long time to program us 

451
00:29:11,411 --> 00:29:16,411
into something that's vaguely capable of
maneuvering on its own and that produces

452
00:29:16,931 --> 00:29:19,720
of course the very tight familial bonds 
that we all,

453
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,580
that we all desperately require because 
who wants to be alone in the world?

454
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:29,790
But it also,
it also exposes us to the probability of

455
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:34,801
becoming entangled into even 
multigenerational family pathology.

456
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,303
And it isn't obvious always and 
certainly hasn't been to me when I've 

457
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:43,660
seen my clients.
That fundamental problem with the client

458
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:46,900
is the client.
Sometimes the fundamental problem is

459
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,063
is the family
and and perhaps that person has been 

460
00:29:54,151 --> 00:29:54,984
identified as the problem person.
It's rather convenient for everyone who 

461
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,273
involved to make that presupposition.
It's also the case that this is the 

462
00:30:04,381 --> 00:30:05,880
Friday and idea.
Fundamentally,

463
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:10,470
this is the depaul idea,
that it's very easy for people to become

464
00:30:10,471 --> 00:30:14,310
over dependent on their parents and for 
the parents to facilitate that.

465
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,700
And then for the primary developmental 
problem for the individual,

466
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,413
in fact,
to become free of the interfering 

467
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:30,290
elements of the family so that they can 
exist as independent individuals.

468
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,273
Well,
and then of course there are cultural 

469
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:37,680
variations in that that make that 
proposition complex,

470
00:30:37,681 --> 00:30:41,670
but that's a fundamental tenant,
say a Freudian psychology.

471
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:47,150
A lot of the clinical psychologists,
all of whom that we're going to study,

472
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,313
have a pronounced Western orientation.
One of the fundamental presuppositions 

473
00:30:53,461 --> 00:30:54,294
is that part of the hallmark of positive
psychological development is the 

474
00:30:59,431 --> 00:31:03,270
creation of an individual that's capable
of acting independently.

475
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,220
And that's,
I would say,

476
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:06,054
an implicit ideal that lurks at the 
bottom of the clinical presuppositions 

477
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:14,430
of all the theorists that are classic 
psychologists.

478
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:20,540
So yeah,
now it's a very old picture.

479
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:23,420
Okay.

480
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:28,230
It's Jonah emerging from the whale.
It's a variant of a myth.

481
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:29,893
The Myth is the dragon myth.
I suppose the Dragon Myth is that 

482
00:31:34,191 --> 00:31:38,810
there's a dragon that lives under the 
ground that's eternal.

483
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:44,740
And now and then it rises out of the 
ground to threaten the state and someone

484
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:51,490
within the state determines to go 
confront the dragon voluntarily and does

485
00:31:52,731 --> 00:31:55,730
so and then brings back something of 
great value.

486
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:01,450
Sometimes if the,
if the hero is generally male,

487
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:06,470
sometimes the thing of great value is a 
female that the dragon has kidnapped.

488
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,850
That's a St George Story and sometimes 
it's gold and other treasure,

489
00:32:10,851 --> 00:32:12,530
like in the story of the Hobbit and

490
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,610
story that you all know very well,
it's a classic hero story.

491
00:32:17,611 --> 00:32:18,444
And the hero's story is another 
fundamental element of the clinical 

492
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,024
theories.
I would say it's predicated on the idea 

493
00:32:26,371 --> 00:32:31,371
that you learn through voluntary contact
with that that frightens or disgusts you

494
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:38,790
and that's a hallmark of psychoanalytic 
theory.

495
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,063
Young Carl Young who will discuss in 
detail said his primary dictum was in 

496
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,193
steer Colinas invented tour,
which I'm sure I'm massacring because 

497
00:32:49,071 --> 00:32:49,904
it's Latin,
but it meant in filth that will be 

498
00:32:52,341 --> 00:32:55,160
found.
And one of the hallmarks of the clinical

499
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:59,930
theories is that within the confines of 
everyone's experience,

500
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,973
and you could think about this as 
experience out in the world or 

501
00:33:03,471 --> 00:33:07,340
experience in the unconscious mind,
there are

502
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:13,990
dirty little secrets let's say,
and skeletons and

503
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,553
dreadful old fears and remnants of abuse
and memories of pathological behavior 

504
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:24,254
and failures of courage that you leave 
you undeveloped perhaps out of 

505
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:31,004
avoidance,
and that the psychoanalytic process is 

506
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:35,144
precisely the careful encounter with 
those forgotten and and repressed 

507
00:33:41,991 --> 00:33:46,991
elements of the self in the hope that a 
clear encounter will redeem them,

508
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,873
unite them with the remainder of your 
personality and make you make you 

509
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,880
stronger in consequence.

510
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,343
And I would say that that's just a 
variant of the manner in which human 

511
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:01,034
beings learn.
And we'll talk about this more in 

512
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:07,310
relationship to piaget because you 
always learn when you're wrong,

513
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,463
which is very annoying.
Now what do you learn when you're 

514
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:14,120
correct you,
you're walking in the world,

515
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:14,954
you're operating in the world,
you have a sense of what you want to 

516
00:34:18,021 --> 00:34:18,854
have happen.
You're always looking at the world 

517
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:23,120
through this sense of what you want to 
have happen.

518
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:27,530
You're acting so that what you want to 
have happen will happen.

519
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,400
And when it happens,
well then you're happy because,

520
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:34,520
well first of all,
you get what you want and that's good.

521
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,443
Maybe depending on what you want.
But it's also good because if you get 

522
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:42,740
what you want when you act,
then it turns out that your model of how

523
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:44,980
to act is valid right now.

524
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:45,823
Outcome that you get what you want 
indicates no error on the part of your 

525
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:50,594
model.
But it's very frequently the case that 

526
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,470
when you act to get what you want,
you don't get what you want.

527
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:02,150
And then that's unpleasant because you 
don't get what you want.

528
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,433
But it's even more unpleasant because it
brings with it the hint of a suggestion 

529
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:07,723
that the manner in which you're 
construing the world is incorrect at 

530
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:15,350
some indeterminant level.
So for example,

531
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,240
if you tell a party,
tell a joke at a party,

532
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,680
you presume that people will attend.
And then when they hear the joke,

533
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:25,783
they will laugh.
And then if you tell the joke and it 

534
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:32,630
goes flat or even worse,
disgusts and offends people,

535
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,793
then you're going to be taken aback.
And that's partly because you get what 

536
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:39,660
you want and that's not so good.
But it's,

537
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,490
but it's more because there's something 
wrong with the way you conceptualize the

538
00:35:44,491 --> 00:35:47,790
situation and then you're faced with a 
problem.

539
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:51,840
And the problem is the emergence of a 
domain of the unknown.

540
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:54,120
It's like,
well what kind of mistake did you make?

541
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,340
Maybe you're not as funny as you think 
you are.

542
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,740
Not.
That could be a big problem.

543
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,780
Maybe you're not around people that who 
are the way you think they are.

544
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:06,690
Maybe they don't like you as much as you
thought they liked you.

545
00:36:06,691 --> 00:36:07,524
I mean the,
the potential for various paranoid 

546
00:36:11,161 --> 00:36:11,994
thoughts of increasing severity to come 
welling up at you in a situation where 

547
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:17,334
you make a,
even a trivial social mistake is quite 

548
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:23,010
broad.
And when you make an error of that sort,

549
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,593
you have to face it and sort through all
the possibilities so that you can find 

550
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:31,680
out what it was that you did wrong and 
how to retool it.

551
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:35,130
So that in the future you don't make the
same mistake.

552
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,380
And that requires,
well,

553
00:36:37,381 --> 00:36:38,214
that requires in some sense what you 
might describe as a journey into the 

554
00:36:40,561 --> 00:36:41,550
belly of the beast.

555
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,383
The beast being that place where things 
have fallen apart and where you're 

556
00:36:45,421 --> 00:36:49,240
overwhelmed with negative emotion and 
chaos and confusion.

557
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:50,074
And that's a very old story.
That's the story of the journey to the 

558
00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:55,530
underworld.
And the hero is the person who makes the

559
00:36:55,531 --> 00:36:56,364
voluntary journey to the underworld to 
collect what's been languishing down 

560
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:00,984
there.
And that's the basic motif of 

561
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:06,960
psychoanalytic theory.
I would say it's the basic motif in some

562
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:11,961
sense of clinical practice because one 
of the things that you do as a clinician

563
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:17,820
is find out what people are afraid of 
and what they're avoiding.

564
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:21,540
And that can be in their past or in 
their present or in their future.

565
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,243
Break it down into smaller pieces and 
help them devise strategies of approach 

566
00:37:28,141 --> 00:37:28,974
and mastery.
And that improves the quality of their 

567
00:37:32,191 --> 00:37:33,024
personality and helps develop them into 
people who won't make the same mistakes 

568
00:37:38,851 --> 00:37:39,930
over and over again.

569
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:42,870
All right,
so,

570
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,990
well,
why these,

571
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,900
this plethora of tools?
Well,

572
00:37:48,901 --> 00:37:53,901
I said in some sense being a personality
psychologist is like being an engineer.

573
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:00,870
You're trying to build better people and
you might say that if you're a carpenter

574
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,513
or a mechanic,
that your ability to fix a vehicle or 

575
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:12,270
build a house is dependent on your 
proficiency with regards to the use of a

576
00:38:12,271 --> 00:38:15,390
multitude of tools.
And so then you might say,

577
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:16,224
well,
the more tools you have at your 

578
00:38:16,801 --> 00:38:17,634
disposal,
the more likely it is that you're going 

579
00:38:20,611 --> 00:38:25,611
to manage things properly.
And so what I would like to offer you is

580
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:29,190
the possibility that what you're going 
to encounter in this course

581
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,583
is a series of sophisticated conceptual 
tools that will help you understand 

582
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:40,900
yourself better and therefore better 
orient yourself in the world.

583
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,943
I regard this course is intensely 
practical and that's because I believe 

584
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:51,451
that you have nothing to rely on in your
life that's more crucial to your success

585
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,073
as you move through life,
then your character and your 

586
00:38:57,821 --> 00:38:58,654
personality,
that's what you bring to every 

587
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:01,390
situation.

588
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:07,230
And the more sophisticated you are in 
relationship to yourself and others,

589
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,673
the more you understand people,
the deeper you understand the nature of 

590
00:39:12,281 --> 00:39:13,114
your own being,
the more likely it is that you're going 

591
00:39:15,881 --> 00:39:16,714
to proceed through your life in a manner
that will make you pleased to exist 

592
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,463
rather than displeased to exist.
I've collected the writings of people 

593
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:32,950
that I regard as of in comparable,
brilliant.

594
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:37,930
They're difficult to understand.
Their concepts are complex,

595
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:38,973
but it's not surprising because the 
subject matter is complex and vital and 

596
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:48,730
so it requires work and I would say try 
to keep up on the readings if you would.

597
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,030
It's going to make the course much more 
much richer for you.

598
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,820
And I would say because people often ask
me,

599
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:56,860
well,
how should I read for this course?

600
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:01,980
Cause there's a lot of reading and 
answer is read as if it matters.

601
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,323
That's the right answer.
Don't be thinking about how it's going 

602
00:40:06,761 --> 00:40:07,594
to be tested.
If you do the readings and you come to 

603
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:09,694
the lectures,
then the tests aren't particularly 

604
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,993
difficult.
But you should read the readings as if 

605
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:20,920
the person is writing about you and you 
should try to understand what the person

606
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:23,560
says because it's another tool for you 
to use.

607
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,860
And I would say,
well with my clients,

608
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,023
you know I use the approaches of one 
theorist for one client and the 

609
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:32,470
approaches of another theorist for 
another client.

610
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,543
It seems to me to depend to some degree 
actually on the temperament of the 

611
00:40:36,221 --> 00:40:37,054
client.
I found for example that people who are 

612
00:40:39,251 --> 00:40:42,310
very high in openness,
which is the creativity dimension,

613
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:46,000
are quite amenable to a young Ian 
Approach.

614
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:49,090
Whereas people who are more practical,
conscientious,

615
00:40:49,091 --> 00:40:52,840
low and openness are much more amenable 
to a behaviorist approach.

616
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,063
We don't really know enough about 
psychology yet to match treatment to 

617
00:40:58,511 --> 00:40:59,344
temperament,
but those are the some of the things 

618
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:04,090
that I've experienced.
Okay.

619
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:04,924
Practicalities.
Well there's a website I gave you the 

620
00:41:10,181 --> 00:41:11,014
url,
I'll put it up again at the end of 

621
00:41:11,771 --> 00:41:12,604
class.
The Url lists all the readings that 

622
00:41:14,951 --> 00:41:19,480
aren't in the textbook and so the 
textbook contains the classic readings,

623
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,990
readings from people like young and 
Freud,

624
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,770
piaget and so forth.
Rogers.

625
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,593
And as I said,
I picked that particular textbook 

626
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:30,634
because I believe that the author did a 
very credible job of summarizing what's 

627
00:41:35,091 --> 00:41:35,924
very difficult to summarize.
So and then also on the website there 

628
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:41,114
are links to papers because much of the 
more modern material that pertains say 

629
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:48,980
to neuroscience and also to trait 
personality,

630
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,503
I think it's better just to read the 
original papers and all detail them out 

631
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:53,804
with you as we go through.
And that'll also give you some 

632
00:41:56,151 --> 00:41:58,760
familiarity with original psychological 
papers,

633
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,640
which are again,
there's a,

634
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,840
there's an idiom that you have to master
in order to understand them,

635
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,123
but you might as well practice it,
especially if you're interested in 

636
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:15,071
continuing with psychology in your 
educational practice or as a career.

637
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:19,430
It's good to get accustomed to it.
So

638
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:26,920
there again is the url for the class.
If you go to Jordan B.

639
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,900
Peterson Dotcom,
which isn't too hard to remember,

640
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:34,090
assuming you can remember my name,
then classes are listed on the left hand

641
00:42:34,091 --> 00:42:36,820
side.
You can just find the syllabus there.

642
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:38,723
MMM.

643
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,480
All right,
so here's what we're going to cover.

644
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:43,933
Well today,
obviously this is the introduction and 

645
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:46,214
overview class is a little strange this 
year because one day it's an hour and 

646
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:49,784
the next day it's two hours,
so not exactly sure how we're going to 

647
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,770
negotiate our way through that but we'll
figure it out.

648
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:01,250
Historical perspectives,
mythological representations.

649
00:43:01,251 --> 00:43:02,084
Well I told you that I would try to 
provide you with a Meta narrative that 

650
00:43:05,511 --> 00:43:10,160
might enable you to link the theories 
that we're going to talk about together.

651
00:43:10,161 --> 00:43:10,994
So I'm going to describe to you what you
might regard as a conceptual language 

652
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:18,080
and as far as I can tell,
it's the imagine,

653
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:18,943
imagine that there are two kinds of 
things that you need to know and I 

654
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,880
believe this to be the case.
I believe that you need to know what the

655
00:43:25,881 --> 00:43:29,660
world is made of and I suppose that's 
the proper domain of science,

656
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,033
but then you need to know how to act and
that's a whole different thing and you 

657
00:43:35,121 --> 00:43:37,070
need to know how to act.
That's the thing.

658
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:39,320
You need to know most of anything of 
anything.

659
00:43:39,321 --> 00:43:41,380
Because of course you're a living 
creature.

660
00:43:41,381 --> 00:43:45,830
And action in relationship to desired 
goals is,

661
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,240
is everything to you.

662
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,000
And you can think about that from a 
Darwinian perspective.

663
00:43:50,001 --> 00:43:52,580
You have to act at least so that you can
survive,

664
00:43:52,581 --> 00:43:56,210
at least so that you can find a partner 
that's,

665
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:59,000
that's life.
And so part of the question is,

666
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,770
well,
how does the world look?

667
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:06,040
If you think about it as a place to act?
And the answer isn't a place of value.

668
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:10,760
Free objects.
That's not what the world looks like.

669
00:44:10,761 --> 00:44:11,594
And you can't act in a world of value 
free objects because there's no way of 

670
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:19,130
choosing between them.
If everything has zero value,

671
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,800
why would you choose one thing over 
another?

672
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:26,980
You live in a world where things present
themselves to you as of different value.

673
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:30,470
And that's partly a consequence of your 
temperament,

674
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,370
although it's consequence of other 
things.

675
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:37,850
And so what I'm going to try to do is to
provide you with a Schema that describes

676
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:41,910
the world of morality,
roughly speaking,

677
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:42,744
which is how to act and tell you a 
little bit about what I think the 

678
00:44:45,961 --> 00:44:48,750
languages,
which I think was derived from Darwinian

679
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,830
processes.

680
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,053
And I believe that it's within that 
structure that the clinical theories 

681
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:57,570
logically nest.
And so that'll give you a way of linking

682
00:44:57,571 --> 00:44:58,404
one theory to another from a conceptual 
perspective without having to rely so 

683
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:03,924
much on sheer memorization.
Then we'll talk about heroic and 

684
00:45:06,741 --> 00:45:09,450
shamanic initiations.
And the reason we're going to do that is

685
00:45:09,451 --> 00:45:10,410
because,
well,

686
00:45:10,411 --> 00:45:11,244
people,
people use [inaudible] initiations for 

687
00:45:13,861 --> 00:45:17,100
tens of thousands of years all over the 
world and they have a particular kind of

688
00:45:17,101 --> 00:45:20,280
structure.
The paper by Murcia Ellie Outta which is

689
00:45:20,281 --> 00:45:21,114
linked on the site is a very interesting
one in details out some of these 

690
00:45:24,271 --> 00:45:25,700
processes.
Um,

691
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,693
there have been intelligent commentators
like on [inaudible] or j who wrote the 

692
00:45:30,601 --> 00:45:33,510
discovery of the unconscious,
which I think is an outstanding book,

693
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,290
who linked the processes that the 
psychoanalysts,

694
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:38,124
psychoanalysts uncovered in the late 
part of the 19th century and early part 

695
00:45:42,421 --> 00:45:46,860
of the 20th century,
back to these more primordial rituals of

696
00:45:46,861 --> 00:45:48,420
personality transformation.

697
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:53,420
And so we're going to situate ourselves 
in some sense in deep history,

698
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:59,070
talking first about the underlying 
mythological landscape,

699
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,910
then talking about archaic modes of 
personality,

700
00:46:02,911 --> 00:46:03,744
conceptualization and transformation.
And then moving from there into 

701
00:46:07,201 --> 00:46:10,800
constructivism and,
and we're going to concentrate mostly on

702
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:13,320
John Piaget who has a developmental 
psychologist.

703
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,360
Constructivists believe that you make 
yourself out of the information that you

704
00:46:18,361 --> 00:46:21,030
gather in the world.
So you're an exploring creature.

705
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,133
You explore specifically when the maps 
that you're using in the world are no 

706
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:28,500
longer orienting yourself properly when 
they're producing errors.

707
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:29,334
You'd go out and gather information and 
assemble yourself from the information 

708
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:34,910
that you discovered.
Then the depths,

709
00:46:34,911 --> 00:46:36,870
psychologists,
young and Freud,

710
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:38,123
I think I'm going to with young,
I'm going to walk you through some 

711
00:46:42,991 --> 00:46:46,170
films.
I'm not going to use the films per se.

712
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:49,350
I'm going to use clips stills from the 
film,

713
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:50,580
but in,
you know,

714
00:46:50,581 --> 00:46:51,090
the film.

715
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:53,130
So in,
in chronological order,

716
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:54,503
and I'm going to try to explain to you 
how you might use union presuppositions 

717
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,210
to understand what the films are about.
You know,

718
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:05,580
if you think about a film,
say like the Lion King,

719
00:47:05,581 --> 00:47:07,440
which was an extraordinarily popular 
film,

720
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:10,920
it's a very strange phenomena that you 
go and watch it,

721
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:12,121
right?
I mean,

722
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:12,954
think about it,
it's drawings of animated animals that 

723
00:47:16,771 --> 00:47:21,180
in some sense represent you.
They're very low resolution,

724
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:22,014
but you perceive them immediately as 
living things and you attribute to the 

725
00:47:26,851 --> 00:47:28,470
motivation and,
and,

726
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:29,763
and motive power and understanding.
You do it automatically without even 

727
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:33,034
thinking about it.
And there's a classic plot that lies 

728
00:47:35,531 --> 00:47:38,140
underneath those stories.
And the plots are very,

729
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:38,861
very,
very,

730
00:47:38,861 --> 00:47:42,130
very old.
And that's why you can understand them.

731
00:47:42,131 --> 00:47:45,490
And the reason you can understand them 
is because life has a plot,

732
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:48,340
or maybe it has a couple of plots,
a multitude of plots,

733
00:47:48,341 --> 00:47:49,980
but life has applaud.

734
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:50,853
And if it didn't,
we wouldn't be able to understand each 

735
00:47:51,881 --> 00:47:52,714
other.
And so I'd like to illustrate that for 

736
00:47:54,461 --> 00:47:57,520
you by an analysis of some of these 
films.

737
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:02,380
I think it's the best way to understand 
someone as sophisticated as young who is

738
00:48:02,381 --> 00:48:05,320
very difficult to get a handle on.
Freud.

739
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:06,603
I'm going to do the same thing,
although I am going to show you a film 

740
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:09,334
with Freud.
I'm going to show you a film called 

741
00:48:10,301 --> 00:48:11,134
Crumb,
which is a documentary and it's about a 

742
00:48:14,621 --> 00:48:19,210
very badly in meshed family and the 
attempts of the family members too,

743
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,940
I suppose escape it.
I'll talk to you about Freud.

744
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:22,774
I'll show you the film.
That should give you a sense of Friday 

745
00:48:24,231 --> 00:48:25,064
and psychopathology,
which is a very difficult thing 

746
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,460
otherwise to understand.
Then there's a midterm.

747
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:33,580
Midterm is multiple choice.
You'll do it in class.

748
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,160
You'll,
you'll have lots of time to finish it.

749
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:39,670
It'll cover the material that we took.
We studied up to that point.

750
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:44,200
Then we're going to talk about Rogers.
Carl Rogers who was a humanist.

751
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:46,503
Rogers has a body centered philosophy I 
suppose and he's interested as well in 

752
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:51,663
optimal personal development and the 
role that interpersonal communication 

753
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,520
plays in that Rogers hypothesis.
Fundamentally,

754
00:48:57,521 --> 00:49:01,960
and it's a very interesting one,
is that honest communication between two

755
00:49:01,961 --> 00:49:04,450
people can produce personality 
transformation.

756
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,460
And you know,
you might think,

757
00:49:06,461 --> 00:49:07,294
well you kind of know that already 
because there's something very engaging 

758
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:13,720
about a deep,
honest conversation where you're able to

759
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:15,970
say things that you wouldn't normally 
say,

760
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,373
where you're being listened to by 
someone who's actually listening to you 

761
00:49:19,721 --> 00:49:20,554
and you're listening to them and in the 
conversation you're moving both of you 

762
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:24,663
further to a different point.
That's different than a conversation 

763
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:28,204
where you're right and you're trying to 
convince me or I'm right and I'm trying 

764
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:31,864
to convince you,
which I would say is the typical 

765
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:33,874
conversation.

766
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:36,850
The,
the healing conversation is more,

767
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,680
well,
what's up with you?

768
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:39,670
You know,
how are you doing?

769
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,930
What,
how's your life going?

770
00:49:40,931 --> 00:49:42,610
Where,
what sort of problems are you facing?

771
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,593
What do you think about those problems?
Can you conceptualize what a solution 

772
00:49:46,571 --> 00:49:47,404
might be?
Is there a way we could figure out how 

773
00:49:48,521 --> 00:49:49,900
to get there?
You know,

774
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:50,291
it's,
so,

775
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:51,124
it's a problem solving conversation and 
it's predicated on the presupposition 

776
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:58,270
that the person that you're conversing 
with has the capacity to grow.

777
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:00,580
In a positive direction if they so 
choose.

778
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:04,900
That's the fundamental,
that's the fundamental presupposition of

779
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:09,040
Rogerian psychology.
May and Frankl are also humanists

780
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,373
all finished.
Tell you what the rest of the rest of 

781
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:14,680
the material is.
The next time that we meet,

782
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,530
I should show you,
let you know a little bit more about the

783
00:50:17,531 --> 00:50:20,980
structure of the course.
The second midterm is March 14th,

784
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,720
the and there's a final at the end as 
well.

785
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:28,090
So

786
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:28,923
the,
the multiple choice tests are graded in 

787
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:35,080
that manner.
25% 25% in 27.5%.

788
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,243
They're not cumulative.
Each test only covers what you covered 

789
00:50:39,821 --> 00:50:41,650
before,
since the last test,

790
00:50:41,651 --> 00:50:42,484
including the final,
you'll be required to write an essay of 

791
00:50:44,951 --> 00:50:47,590
15%.
It's a thousand words,

792
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:49,510
sorry,
not 750 words.

793
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,710
And you'll also do an online exercise,
a personality analysis,

794
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:56,620
um,
which is pass fail.

795
00:50:56,621 --> 00:50:59,440
All you have to do is complete it and 
show proof of completion.

796
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:04,300
It helps you do a modified big five 
analysis of your own personality,

797
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,540
concentrating on your virtues and your 
faults.

798
00:51:07,541 --> 00:51:09,460
So that so,
so it's uh,

799
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:10,743
it's an active exercise in the 
application of personality theory to 

800
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:17,560
personal development.
And so that's the,

801
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:20,470
that's the structure of the course.
Um,

802
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,580
I can tell you

803
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:28,130
there's a signup sheet on the,
on the syllabus.

804
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:30,583
We,
I've broken the essays down into 

805
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,800
multiple types across the entire 
semester.

806
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:36,290
I would highly recommend that you go 
there and sign up.

807
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,670
There are limited slots for each topic.
And the reason for that is,

808
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:41,773
well,
I don't want my ta to have to grade 200 

809
00:51:43,161 --> 00:51:43,994
essays the last week of classes.
We have to spread them out across the 

810
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,533
year.
So figure out a topic and sign up 

811
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,523
please.
And please do that sooner rather than 

812
00:51:52,851 --> 00:51:53,660
later.
It's,

813
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:57,530
it's an industrious thing to do.
It'll help you organize yourself.

814
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,190
I'll post something that's quite useful 
about how to write,

815
00:52:01,191 --> 00:52:02,024
especially a thousand word essay and 
I'll close the essays are due one day 

816
00:52:07,161 --> 00:52:08,510
before class.
Oh,

817
00:52:08,511 --> 00:52:09,740
close.
By the way,

818
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:13,280
by telling you who shouldn't take this 
course.

819
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:15,320
Okay.
First of all,

820
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:19,730
if you didn't like this lecture,
then don't take this course because this

821
00:52:19,731 --> 00:52:21,440
is what the lectures are going to be 
like.

822
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,200
So,
and they're not for everybody.

823
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:25,483
Um,
I use a lot of loose associations and 

824
00:52:27,921 --> 00:52:32,120
try to gather them back in and I kind of
wander around that way.

825
00:52:32,121 --> 00:52:34,430
I can talk directly to you,
which I liked doing,

826
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:37,340
but I sacrifice a certain amount of 
organization for that.

827
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,790
But my stance is that it's worth the 
sacrifice.

828
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:46,180
The second thing is there's a lot of 
reading a lot and a lot of it is,

829
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:51,470
I would say a lot of it's hard science,
the last half in particular,

830
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:55,040
but the first half of a lot of its 
philosophical in nature,

831
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:56,030
philosophical,
slash,

832
00:52:56,031 --> 00:52:59,960
psychological.
And so if you're not interested in that,

833
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,033
like if you're a pure science type and 
you're not interested in the clinical 

834
00:53:05,271 --> 00:53:06,104
elements,
say have personality and in the end in 

835
00:53:08,501 --> 00:53:09,334
investigating the philosophical 
underpinnings of those clinical 

836
00:53:11,961 --> 00:53:12,794
theories,
then I would say this isn't the course 

837
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:14,624
for you.
And so you should take that seriously 

838
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:17,564
because the readings are hard.
There's a lot of work involved in this 

839
00:53:19,551 --> 00:53:20,384
course.
And it would be better if you took a 

840
00:53:22,101 --> 00:53:25,250
course that you actually wanted to take.
So,

841
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,633
well,
welcome to psychology to 30 and we'll 

842
00:53:28,501 --> 00:53:29,334
see you in a bit.
