1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,163
Yeah,

2
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:36,400
so today I'm going to tell you the best 
three stories that I know.

3
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,473
I think these stories are absolutely 
phenomenally potent and the reason for 

4
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:47,851
that is that I think they illustrate in 
an extraordinarily powerful way

5
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,593
the nature of the processes that lead to
the establishment of Western democratic 

6
00:00:57,071 --> 00:00:57,904
ideals received whose work I rely on 
substantially substantially to make the 

7
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:05,194
following argument has taken Western 
academic culture to task in a manner 

8
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:17,071
that hasn't fully been revealed yet.
He said that like all human cultures,

9
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:20,140
the West is parochial and narrow in its 
viewpoint,

10
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,543
and although over the last 300 years,
there's been a substantial amount of 

11
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,413
cross cultural intermingling and a 
potential broadening of philosophical 

12
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:33,100
and religious horizon broadening has not
been sufficiently complete.

13
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,623
If we build on the viewpoint that I've 
been developing with you over the last 

14
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,913
few courses and make the presupposition 
that religious modes of thinking are 

15
00:01:48,071 --> 00:01:50,560
more phenomenological than they are 
rational,

16
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,890
which means that they deal more with 
what you experience say.

17
00:01:53,891 --> 00:01:54,724
Then with the objective world,
if we look at archaic religious stories 

18
00:01:58,061 --> 00:01:58,894
through that Lens,
then they can start to open up and so 

19
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,160
given that I want to open up three 
religious stories to you today too,

20
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,940
in depth and one only in passing because
we'll return to it later.

21
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,840
I'll start with a Judaeo Christian myth 
of genesis.

22
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,010
When I say myth,
I don't mean untruth.

23
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,173
I mean a form of knowledge that's 
narrative instructor and predicated on 

24
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,983
presumptions that aren't empirical.
A myth describes processes of 

25
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:33,904
transformation.
A myth describes the process whereby 

26
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,770
elements of experience come into being 
and transform.

27
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,623
The fundamental structural
elements of genesis are the word of God 

28
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,610
and chaos
and Hebrew,

29
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:52,444
words for chaos and waste our tail for 
chaos and Tau who for waste and Tom in 

30
00:02:58,691 --> 00:02:59,524
particular,
Tohu who as well are very interesting 

31
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:06,340
words because you can track their 
derivation historically and sometimes if

32
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:08,560
you can track the derivation of words 
historically,

33
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,460
you can get some sense of the culture 
mill you out of which the word sprang,

34
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,343
and we know what time at means because 
we have written records of a story that 

35
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,114
involves a character named ty Matt and 
time out as a dragon who lives at the 

36
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:24,220
bottom of the ocean.

37
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,940
In the oldest creation myth we have,
which is the Enuma Elish,

38
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,600
the Sumerian creation myth,
Sumeria,

39
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,183
Babylon acadia rightly regarded as the 
birthplace of modern western 

40
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:38,560
civilization.

41
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,520
In Genesis two,
processes unite to produce being

42
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,920
the first of those processes are states 
is chaos represented by tail Marto,

43
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,913
who?
The second of those processes is logos 

44
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,960
and logos is another word that has an 
extraordinarily broad range of meaning.

45
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:12,710
It's generally transcribed in the 
Christian tradition has the word,

46
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:13,764
and it's identified with Christ,
which is a very peculiar identification 

47
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:20,430
because it's the word of God that 
creates order out of chaos,

48
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,593
and of course the word of God in Genesis
is a phenomena that predates the birth 

49
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:29,040
of Christ infinitely from a classical 
religious perspective,

50
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,003
so the fact that the two beings are 
identified as a great peculiarity and 

51
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:37,584
also of great interest,
the fundamental story of genesis as 

52
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:41,814
something like this
and it's perhaps the most brilliant 

53
00:04:45,361 --> 00:04:49,320
contribution of Judeo Christian thought 
to world history,

54
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,513
it's,
it's total impact is virtually 

55
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:56,620
incalculable.
The idea is this,

56
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:57,454
that chaos can be conceptualized as 
something that has an essentially 

57
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:01,104
feminine aspect as a matrix and a matrix
is a structure from which other 

58
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:09,471
structures emerge and the story in 
genesis makes the hypothesis that logos,

59
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,853
which is the word of God,
a phenomena associated with speech and 

60
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:18,150
communication and logic,
logos,

61
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,310
logic,
rationality,

62
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,040
courage,
exploration,

63
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,420
all combined into a single entity or a 
trait logos.

64
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,660
The combination of logos and chaos is 
what brings order into being.

65
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,870
That's what the story in genesis means.
It's not an empirical description of the

66
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:37,584
origin of objects.
It's a phenomenological description of 

67
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:45,591
the origin of experience,
the idea being that without the piercing

68
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,333
glance of whatever consciousness is,
whatever the background of experience 

69
00:05:52,021 --> 00:05:53,880
is,
the Matrix,

70
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:54,743
chaos cannot be conceptualized as real.
It takes the interplay between the 

71
00:05:58,851 --> 00:05:59,684
feminine principle chaos and the 
masculine principle logos in order to 

72
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:04,004
produce being
now that's of substantial importance 

73
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:12,260
when you give some consideration to the 
fact that immediately in genesis,

74
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,250
after the establishment of livable 
order,

75
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,173
the data Yahuah identifies as the 
individual human being with logos right 

76
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,573
made in God's image.
That's the essential characteristic of 

77
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:28,484
the human being and what that means is 
that the logo is that operates in human 

78
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:35,240
beings,
which is this capacity to make order out

79
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:36,074
of chaos is identical to the principal.
That gives rise to the cosmos from a 

80
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:39,944
mythological perspective,
so it partakes of the daddy in a very 

81
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:44,024
direct sense.
In so far as being itself is dependent 

82
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:51,200
on its operation.
Now,

83
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,543
it's still possible to claim given that 
perspective that a story with that sort 

84
00:06:57,441 --> 00:07:01,610
of structure is superstitious and then 
it doesn't bear any relationship.

85
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:02,444
To what actually constitutes reality,
but you have to understand that that 

86
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:07,500
story,
old as it is,

87
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:08,334
is predicated on older stories and it's 
on the ground that those older stories 

88
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:16,070
established that our entire concept of 
natural rights rests.

89
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,353
So if you believe that natural rights 
have an existence that's more than 

90
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:22,580
merely arbitrary,

91
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,490
the reason you believe that is because 
they're predicate,

92
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,490
those rights are predicated on the ideas
that are expressed in these myths.

93
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,260
Okay,
so now we're going to go back in time to

94
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:38,094
Sumeria and I'm going to show you how 
this Sumerian creation myth lays itself 

95
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,480
out.
And not only that,

96
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:47,481
I'm going to describe to you the direct 
political implications of the enumerated

97
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,010
list,
the Sumerian creation myth,

98
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:50,844
because the political implications of 
that myth are well understood because 

99
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:54,714
the political structure of Sumeria was 
directly associated with the structure 

100
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,244
of the myth because the Sumerian emperor
was regarded as the earthly 

101
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,400
representative of the highest God in the
Mesopotamian Pantheon,

102
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,150
whose name was Marta.
So in so far as you were emperor,

103
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:16,410
the reason that you were emperor,
and this is what gave your sovereignty

104
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,320
legitimacy,
right?

105
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,030
Because sovereignty has to have 
legitimacy,

106
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:21,864
otherwise there's constant revolutions.
What gave sovereignty legitimacy in 

107
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:29,250
Mesopotamia was the identification of 
the emperor with Marta and that has,

108
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,230
that has certain implications for the 
emperor,

109
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:34,830
which we'll discuss in some detail.
The story starts like this,

110
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,780
you've got this dragon,
Talia,

111
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:42,390
Matt,
and tie them out is a great primordial

112
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,773
beast who lives at the bottom of the 
ocean and the ocean is water and water 

113
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:54,420
is associated with the primal element in
archaic thinking,

114
00:08:54,421 --> 00:08:56,550
and I you.
There's reasons for that already.

115
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,563
If you viewed the transformation of 
deserts as a consequence of rain can 

116
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:04,410
understand why water would be considered
the element that gives life,

117
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:05,244
right?
That the element that that brings life 

118
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:07,464
fourth,
and we know from an evolutionary 

119
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:09,174
perspective that that's accurate and we 
know that we're 90 percent water and so 

120
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:13,380
to consider water.

121
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,950
The primal element is no trivial 
conclusion.

122
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,813
No,
no less than presuming that the sun is 

123
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:21,930
the ultimate source of life,
the ultimate God,

124
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:22,764
because the sun is the ultimate source 
of life as far as we're concerned on 

125
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:26,071
earth,
right?

126
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:27,570
Because it's the source of all our 
energy.

127
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,610
These aren't stupid concepts.
All right,

128
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,444
so timeout is this horrible creature 
that lurks at the bottom of the primal 

129
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,450
element right now.
She has a husband app suit.

130
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,363
Now,
the massive Batavia and creation myth 

131
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:40,284
doesn't say much about Appsu.
We only know that he's the male consort 

132
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,003
of the dragon of chaos,
and we know from reading other sources 

133
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:52,551
of mythology that the male consort of 
the dragon of chaos generally represents

134
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,613
either logos or culture.
So we're gonna make the presupposition 

135
00:09:56,341 --> 00:10:01,341
in this particular case that the husband
of chaos is order or culture.

136
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,423
Okay?
And then the Mesopotamians don't say 

137
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,140
much about that.

138
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,973
That that doesn't.
The development of the idea of apps who 

139
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:08,144
are order or culture doesn't.
It doesn't take new force until the 

140
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:14,190
ancient Egyptians.
We'll talk about them today too.

141
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:15,024
Okay,
so timeout naps who are locked into a 

142
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:21,310
kind of sexual embrace according to the 
Mesopotamian creation,

143
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,860
death.
And what does that mean?

144
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:23,963
It kind of means two things.
It means that they're not really 

145
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:30,420
distinguishable because they're locked 
into this embrace and it also means that

146
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,254
they're up to something creative because
the act of sexual congress in mythology 

147
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:36,144
is most usefully,
is most frequently utilized as 

148
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:40,404
representation of something creative or 
as representation of the probability of 

149
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,730
some new form coming to be right.
All right,

150
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,564
so cop suit and tie them out are locked 
into this embrace in a state that other 

151
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,450
creation myths describe as egg,
like the pre cosmo Gonek egg,

152
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:03,723
there are intermingling gives rise to 
the initial state of being according to 

153
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:09,710
the Sumerians and the initial state of 
being.

154
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,323
According to the Sumerians is 
characterized by the dominion of the 

155
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:18,731
elder gods.
These gods feeding none to bright make a

156
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:24,340
tremendous amount of racket doing things
well.

157
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,700
What does that mean exactly?

158
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,163
Well,

159
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,430
it means something like this.
They make a lot of racket and they cause

160
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:35,450
a lot of trouble.
They make a lot of wind and all of their

161
00:11:35,451 --> 00:11:37,790
racket and trouble and wind and 
activity.

162
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,290
Rouses tire.
Matt,

163
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,113
what does that mean?

164
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,000
Well,
it means if you do things,

165
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:45,834
you get in trouble.
It means even if you're trying to solve 

166
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:48,924
problems,
you get into trouble because the 

167
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:51,144
solution to a problem,
Chin tends to generate a whole bunch of 

168
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:54,250
new problems,
right?

169
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:55,084
It's like the Hydra,
so what it means is that it's more or 

170
00:11:57,521 --> 00:12:02,521
less fainted that any form of activity 
whatsoever

171
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:10,630
is likely to produce the threat of 
catastrophe,

172
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,853
and of course we're absolutely keenly 
aware of that in the modern world 

173
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:18,901
because were possessed by this sense 
that all of our frenetic activity,

174
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,104
all of our frenetic motivated activity 
is producing alterations in the world 

175
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:29,131
order such that nature itself is going 
to be destroyed and eliminate us,

176
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,263
and of course we're absolutely keenly 
aware of that in the modern world 

177
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:45,281
because were possessed by this sense 
that all of our frenetic activity,

178
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:46,514
all of our frenetic motivated activity 
is producing alterations in the world 

179
00:12:50,511 --> 00:12:55,511
order such that nature itself is going 
to be destroyed and eliminate us.

180
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,303
Right?
That's classic Sumerian fear and 

181
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,020
nothing's changed in the last 5,000 
years.

182
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,123
The Sumerians presumed that once the 
elder gods were constructed and started 

183
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:10,670
moving around on the planet,
that their activity,

184
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,760
they're mindless activity.
Because remember,

185
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:16,070
these aren't well integrated 
motivational forces.

186
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:16,904
They're more like primordial beasts 
right there on the integrated activity 

187
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,400
risks,
plunging everything back in chaos.

188
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,860
Well Tire Max,
the representative of chaos,

189
00:13:27,861 --> 00:13:29,400
this generative chaos,
but so what?

190
00:13:29,401 --> 00:13:30,860
At the Sumerian say,
well,

191
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,753
the elder gods caused a lot of racket.
They move around the planet and they 

192
00:13:35,601 --> 00:13:40,601
upset time at and she decides that 
enough is enough and she's going to wipe

193
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:42,704
them out.

194
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,560
So she's sitting at the bottom of the 
ocean,

195
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,910
fuming away as the elder gods go about 
their business,

196
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,750
and then they take one step too many and
they kill Appsu.

197
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:57,763
Who's her husband.
Now the Sumerian creation myth doesn't 

198
00:14:00,261 --> 00:14:01,094
say much about this,
but we know that aps who is the male 

199
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:05,840
consort of chaos,
that makes it harder.

200
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:10,460
So what happens is the elder gods 
destroy order itself.

201
00:14:10,461 --> 00:14:13,130
They destroyed culture itself,
and as soon as you've destroyed culture,

202
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:13,964
all hell breaks loose.
And that's exactly what happens in the 

203
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,124
Sumerian creation myths.
So tye Maddie merges just going to wipe 

204
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:20,624
everything out and the world will revert
back to its primordial non-existent 

205
00:14:24,921 --> 00:14:27,860
state.
Now the elder gods get wind of this,

206
00:14:27,861 --> 00:14:28,694
and of course they're just terrified 
because they know that this thing that 

207
00:14:30,741 --> 00:14:32,840
gave rise to them,
whatever it is,

208
00:14:32,841 --> 00:14:36,350
the matrix of being can easily wipe them
out at a moment's notice,

209
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,393
and so despite the fact that they're 
transpersonal and immortal and 

210
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:43,550
characterized by a certain amount of 
power in the face of absolute chaos,

211
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,810
they're insufficient.

212
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,210
Now this occurrence is extending over a 
protracted period of time,

213
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,343
and as elder gods are threatened,
they're also breeding and mating and 

214
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,810
producing new forms,
and they produce a great,

215
00:14:56,811 --> 00:14:59,630
great grand son whose name is Marta.
Now,

216
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:02,090
mark has a lot of very interesting 
attributes.

217
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,750
The attributes are described in the 
Enuma elish in the following manner.

218
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:06,584
So this is what [inaudible] father sees 
when his wife Damn Kina gives birth to 

219
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:13,700
Marduk.
So when he who's murdered,

220
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:16,220
his father saw his son,
he rejoiced.

221
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,010
He beamed.
His heart was filled with joy.

222
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,500
He distinguished him and conferred upon 
him double equality with the gods.

223
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:25,334
Okay,
so that's the first indication that 

224
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:30,860
whatever Martik represents is something 
that's elevated beyond the normal status

225
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:31,694
of a primordial daddy.
So that he was highly exalted and 

226
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:38,780
surpassed them in everything artfully 
arranged beyond comprehension,

227
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:41,600
where his members not fit for human 
understanding,

228
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,140
hard to look upon for where his eyes 
forward,

229
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:47,090
his ears,
when his lips move,

230
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:48,500
fire blazed forth.

231
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,543
Each of his four years grew large and 
likewise his eyes to see everything he 

232
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:56,420
was exalted among God's surpassing was 
his form.

233
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,900
His members were gigantic.
He was surpassing in height.

234
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,640
Mary Youtube,
Mary Youtube,

235
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,860
one of his names,
son of the son,

236
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:06,200
God the son,
God of the Gods.

237
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,890
Okay.
Complex bit of poetry.

238
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,540
It says a bunch of things.
It says,

239
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,374
well,
whatever Martech is is the offspring of 

240
00:16:14,631 --> 00:16:17,690
the gods.
Whatever Marta is,

241
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,060
is characterized by high heightened 
awareness,

242
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:20,894
right?
Because he has four years and four eyes 

243
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:22,454
and they're large.
Whatever Martech is characterized by as 

244
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:28,490
the status that surpasses that of his 
father's.

245
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,620
Whatever he's characterized by is 
associated with the power of speech.

246
00:16:33,621 --> 00:16:36,260
Real power,
because when he speaks fire spurts.

247
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:40,100
Fourth Marta is also huge,
but more importantly,

248
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:42,830
he's associated in this particular poem 
with a Sun.

249
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,540
Why is that?
Well,

250
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,400
the sun dominates consciousness,
right?

251
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,780
Because we're conscious during the day,
most of our brain is visual Cortex,

252
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:51,763
so we're visual creatures,
so when the sunrises is when the day 

253
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:56,294
begins,
so Martin is also associated with 

254
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:58,934
whatever dandy dominates the day,
and that's the daddy of consciousness 

255
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,920
and there's more to the story of the 
Sun,

256
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,783
right?
Because the sun is also something that 

257
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:06,764
rises and sets repeatedly,
and that means that the dandy that 

258
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:13,820
dominates consciousness is characterized
by a cyclical nature.

259
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,020
That's a son.
Myth,

260
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,183
sunrises in the morning renewed as a 
consequence of fighting a terrible 

261
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:20,534
battle in the night with the enemies of 
everything that's associated with 

262
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:25,580
consciousness.
A Classic Solar Myth,

263
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,170
so absolutely entire Matt give rise to 
the world of the gods,

264
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,430
the activity of the world of Gods 
reawakens timeout.

265
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,713
She decides to destroy everything,
but at that moment the gods give birth 

266
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:46,960
to mark.
Now,

267
00:17:46,961 --> 00:17:51,750
that's a typical motif which is that the
is born at the time of maximal crisis,

268
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,600
and the reason for that is in part it's 
simple.

269
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,750
Look,
if your culture is dealing well with the

270
00:17:57,751 --> 00:18:01,080
forces of the unknown so that everything
is static,

271
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,430
static but productive,
so the problems themselves don't arise.

272
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,140
There's no reason for the hero,
right?

273
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:08,730
There's no reason to confront the 
unknown.

274
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,390
It's only when crisis beckons that the 
birth of the hero is necessary.

275
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:18,480
Marta constitutes the birth of the hero 
and they say,

276
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:19,314
look,
you know,

277
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,153
we're in real trouble unless someone 
goes out there and confronts tire Matt 

278
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,590
Straight on,
she's going to wipe everything out.

279
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,790
Um,
it's a dangerous and terrifying job,

280
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,650
but somebody has to do it.
And Mark says,

281
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:32,610
oh,
well that's no problem,

282
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,444
but I got a few rules here and this is 
the first rule I'm in charge from here 

283
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:41,640
on forward.
What does that mean exactly?

284
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,143
Well,

285
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,920
these archaic stories,
our policy in our policy mic in Northrup

286
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:51,934
fries terminology,
and what that means is that they can be 

287
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,670
misread validly had multiple levels of 
analysis simultaneously.

288
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:58,683
And so one thing it means is that if you
take the two year old child who's 

289
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:07,720
essentially under the dominion of 
assorted primordial Gods and Goddesses,

290
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:09,250
right?
Aggression,

291
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,310
fear,
panic,

292
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,430
and according to Freud,
a certain degree of sexual aggression,

293
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,073
the child moves from domination,
from motivated state to domination for 

294
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:23,874
motivated state,
and it isn't until the age of three and 

295
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:30,681
four when under the pressure applied by 
the social world and as a consequence of

296
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:31,704
the maturation of the prefrontal Cortex,
which matures throughout childhood and 

297
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:36,594
adolescence and doesn't reach its final 
form until perhaps into the early 

298
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,840
twenties.
All of those fundamental motivational us

299
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:46,740
to start taking on a structured 
relationship to one another,

300
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:52,010
which is to say that once your,
as your personality becomes integrated,

301
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,053
a single motive force forward has to 
bring all of these underlying 

302
00:19:58,141 --> 00:20:01,080
motivational systems into some sort of 
harmonious arrangement.

303
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,213
Okay,
so let's,

304
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,230
let's see what the Sumerians are doing 
here.

305
00:20:04,231 --> 00:20:05,011
Okay.
First of all,

306
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:06,600
they're,
they're doing psychology.

307
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:11,550
They're trying to figure out,
given the dominion of the elder gods,

308
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,030
the indisputable dominion of the elder 
gods instincts.

309
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,250
Who should rule,
right?

310
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,293
What should be in charge,
how do you construct the hierarchy of 

311
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:23,790
values and then more complex.
Lee,

312
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,090
when you integrate a state,
which is what?

313
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:28,980
The mesopotamians dead,
right?

314
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:31,170
The first great civilization,
what does that mean?

315
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,333
The first time hundreds of tribes were 
hammered into some sort of stable 

316
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:40,500
hierarchical order.
How do you represent that order?

317
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,240
So Marta gets his act together.
The gods all meet in a huge chamber.

318
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,510
They elect him king.
Then they prepare them for battle.

319
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,233
When the gods,
the father's beheld the power of his 

320
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:57,364
word,
they were glad and then homage saying 

321
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,780
Martin is king.
They bestowed upon them a sceptre,

322
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,733
a throne,
and a royal robe that gave him an 

323
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:05,194
irresistible weapons.
Fighting the enemy saying Golan cutoff 

324
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,650
the life of Tire Matt may the winds 
carry her blood out of the way.

325
00:21:11,651 --> 00:21:12,484
Places after the gods,
his father's had determined the destiny 

326
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:16,864
of Martech.
They set them on the road the way to 

327
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:19,840
success and attainment.

328
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,820
So then he goes to the heart of 
darkness,

329
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:26,470
so to speak,
and confronts tire.

330
00:21:26,471 --> 00:21:27,304
Matt
accuses her of treachery and challenges 

331
00:21:30,431 --> 00:21:32,950
are to battle.
When ty Imad heard this,

332
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:35,680
she became like one in a frenzy and lost
her reason.

333
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,670
She cried out loud and furiously to the 
very roots or two legs,

334
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:40,504
shook back and forth.
She recited an incantation repeatedly 

335
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,510
casting her spell.
As for the gods of battle,

336
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:51,100
they sharpen their weapons,
Tiamat and Marduk the wisest of the gods

337
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,053
advanced against one another.
They pressed onto single combat and 

338
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:57,910
approached for battle.
Okay,

339
00:21:57,911 --> 00:21:58,744
well,
things don't go out so well with 

340
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,630
timeout.
From this point forward,

341
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:05,510
the first thing that Martech does,
it encapsulate her and then net,

342
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,700
and I think that's a really interesting 
metaphor because that's essentially what

343
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:11,830
human beings do when they encounter the 
unknown,

344
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:12,664
right?
They encapsulated in an explanatory 

345
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:15,634
network,
so it's a way of binding up the the 

346
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,680
anomaly or the unknown and giving it a 
substantive form.

347
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,260
Then he cuts her into pieces and then he
makes the world out of her pieces.

348
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,693
In fact,
one of Martin's names is he who makes 

349
00:22:34,361 --> 00:22:37,770
ingenious things as a consequence of the
combat with tire mapped.

350
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:39,850
Oh,
that's very,

351
00:22:39,851 --> 00:22:43,660
very interesting because what it means 
is that the Samaritans are presenting in

352
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:47,200
metaphorical forum.
The notion that when the chips are down,

353
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,034
the survival of being depends on the 
capacity of whatever Martech represents 

354
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:55,720
the solar God to encounter the Matrix of
being,

355
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:58,300
to cut it into pieces and to make the 
world.

356
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,190
If you think about it in those terms,
it's a very,

357
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:01,720
very straightforward story,
right?

358
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:03,520
It's basically the story of human 
beings.

359
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,953
Fundamentally the story of human beings 
because we in the words of a famous 

360
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,820
evolutionary psychologist whose name 
completely escapes me.

361
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,280
We occupied the cognitive niche,
right?

362
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,293
Our motive being his creativity and the 
in the face of the unknown and when 

363
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:24,691
chaos threatens the established motive 
being.

364
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,283
It's necessary for us to put our 
creativity into action and to carve out 

365
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:30,154
new territory or territory as a 
consequence of encounter with the 

366
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,660
unknown.
Why?

367
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,300
Well,
because we can take the world apart with

368
00:23:37,301 --> 00:23:38,134
our hands and put it together in new 
ways and then we can scold what we've 

369
00:23:41,201 --> 00:23:42,034
done verbally and we can transmit it to 
another person and then they can do the 

370
00:23:44,861 --> 00:23:45,694
same thing and we're all doing this all 
the time and we're all telling each 

371
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,124
other how we're doing it.
And that's how the embodiment of logos 

372
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,693
in the human being,
which is precisely equivalent to the 

373
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:55,094
Sumerian notion of Martech.
That's precisely how it is that we're 

374
00:23:57,861 --> 00:24:00,440
constantly capable of redeeming the 
world.

375
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,353
And that's why you make resolutions at 
New Year's because the new you is 

376
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,860
supposed to be born at the new year.
Okay.

377
00:24:11,861 --> 00:24:14,080
So what are the Mesopotamians do it the 
new year,

378
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:18,490
they take their king and they bring them
outside the city.

379
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:22,390
Now you have to understand that outside 
the city is chaos,

380
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,300
right?
Because these are city states.

381
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,590
When you go outside the dominion of the 
human,

382
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,543
you're in chaos.
And then the priest makes the Emperor 

383
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:37,780
Neil and takes all his marks,
have status off him.

384
00:24:37,781 --> 00:24:38,614
So He's reduced to his assets,
fundamentally bereft of his social 

385
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:43,983
persona.
And then he slaps him with a glove and 

386
00:24:46,481 --> 00:24:50,530
humiliates him and the king is reform 
forest to recount his since right?

387
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:54,340
Everything he did in the last year,
that wasn't up to standard so to speak.

388
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,323
And you can see how that'd be pretty 
useful thing to have somebody who's in 

389
00:24:57,641 --> 00:24:59,380
power do on a regular basis.
Right?

390
00:24:59,381 --> 00:25:00,214
Because it reminds them that they're in 
fact subject to a transpersonal 

391
00:25:04,031 --> 00:25:06,970
structure who's nature isn't precisely 
evident,

392
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:11,740
but is nonetheless there,
which is the case act like Marduk or all

393
00:25:11,741 --> 00:25:14,080
hell will break loose and demolish your 
kingdom,

394
00:25:14,081 --> 00:25:16,570
which is,
of course it's true now as it was then.

395
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:21,100
So the emperor gets humiliated.
He asked to recount his sins,

396
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,840
then he's locked up.

397
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,050
Then he reenacts the battle with Tire 
Matt,

398
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,500
and when he emerges victorious,
he's locked up with a ritual prostitute,

399
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,780
a higher duel,
and they mate.

400
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,880
Why?
Well,

401
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:40,714
the higher duel,
the ritual prostitute represents tire 

402
00:25:43,301 --> 00:25:44,021
Matt.
Now,

403
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:46,840
why the hell would that be?
Because timeouts a dragon,

404
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:47,703
right?
A horrible man eating dragon that lives 

405
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:50,314
at the bottom of the ocean,
which is to say that in any encounter 

406
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:55,810
with the unknown,
as difficult,

407
00:25:55,811 --> 00:25:56,644
traumatic and violent as that might be,
there's also the possibility for 

408
00:25:59,651 --> 00:26:02,770
something creative to emerge as a 
consequence,

409
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:03,604
right?
Because it's out of the unknown that we 

410
00:26:04,721 --> 00:26:05,950
mind new information.

411
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,933
So in so far as the Mesopotamian emperor
acted out the role of Marta than he was 

412
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,543
a good emperor.
Then he deserved his sovereignty and 

413
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,580
literally as well as figuratively in so 
far as he did play that role,

414
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,950
then the society was going through 
remain not only stable,

415
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:24,784
but constantly updated because he's 
engaged in this constant creative 

416
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,793
contact with the unknown,
aided and abetted by his attempts to 

417
00:26:33,941 --> 00:26:34,774
remember his own inadequacies and 
weaknesses and to do something about 

418
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:38,800
them.
Okay.

419
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:39,643
So that's a pretty interesting story.
And it gets even more interesting when 

420
00:26:41,831 --> 00:26:42,664
you start to understand the Judeo 
Christian creation myth is assimilated 

421
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:47,274
to the Sumerian creation myth by the 
union of the notions of chaos and tire 

422
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,423
matt.
So the logo's in Judeo Christian 

423
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:55,644
thinking,
the word of God that produces order out 

424
00:26:57,121 --> 00:27:02,121
of chaos is also essentially equivalent,
at least metaphorically speaking,

425
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,790
to whatever Martech represents in the 
Sumerian creation myth.

426
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:10,860
And we know that our relationship with 
the Enuma elish is obscured by time,

427
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:11,694
but our relationship with the stories 
that lay out the fundamental 

428
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:17,130
substructure of Western culture is not 
so ameliorated.

429
00:27:17,131 --> 00:27:19,740
Even though we may not believe them 
explicitly anymore,

430
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,200
they still sit at the basis of our 
society.
