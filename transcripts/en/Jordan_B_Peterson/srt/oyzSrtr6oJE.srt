1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,880
Well,
I'm speaking today with Dr Steven Hicks,

2
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,870
who's a professor of philosophy at in 
the Department of Philosophy at Rockford

3
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,260
University in Illinois,
and Professor Hicks has written a book 

4
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,070
that I found several books,
but he's written one in particular that 

5
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:44,741
I want to talk to him about today called
explaining postmodernism skepticism and 

6
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:47,630
socialism for Moose,
so to food code,

7
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,740
which was published fair,
why it fair while ago now in 2004,

8
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:56,120
but I think has become even more 
pertinent and relevant today.

9
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:01,270
And I have talked a lot to my viewers 
about your book and so let's talk about 

10
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,760
postmodernism and its relationship with 
new Marxism.

11
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:09,850
That's an so maybe you could tell our 
viewers here a little bit more about 

12
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:12,920
yourself and how you got interested in 
this.

13
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:13,640
And

14
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,280
finished graduate school in philosophy 
in the early nineties.

15
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,190
I'm originally from Canada,
born in Toronto.

16
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,780
Uh,
at that point a Pittsburgh and Indiana 

17
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,070
had the two strongest philosophy of 
science and logic programs.

18
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,770
And that's what I was interested in at 
the time.

19
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:35,771
So on a professor recommendation,
I ended up at Indiana and it worked out 

20
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:39,470
very nicely for me.
So most of my graduate work was actually

21
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:42,950
in epistemology philosophy of science,
logic,

22
00:01:42,951 --> 00:01:46,720
some cognitive science issues as well.
So a lot of the ecosystem,

23
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:51,730
a lot of people and philosophical 
linguistic issues that come up being 

24
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,090
postmodernism.
Uh,

25
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:58,091
the groundwork was laid for that when I 
finished Grad school teaching full time,

26
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,080
uh,
came to rutgers university is teaching 

27
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,780
an honors program and the way that 
program worked,

28
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:07,520
it was essentially a great books 
program.

29
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:10,670
So it was like getting a second 
education wonderfully.

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,130
But,
uh,

31
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:16,010
the way it was done was a,
each course was taught by two professors

32
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:21,011
to our honor students and so the 
professors would be from different 

33
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:21,920
departments,
so paired with literature,

34
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:25,580
professors,
history professors and so on.

35
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,130
And this was now the middle of nineties.
I started to hear about to thinkers.

36
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:33,260
I had not read,
I kind of heard about them,

37
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:37,850
but now I was reading them more closely 
and finding that in history,

38
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:42,851
in literature and sociology and pro a 
names like dairy dog who the others were

39
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,690
not omnipresent,
were huge names.

40
00:02:47,691 --> 00:02:51,230
So I realized I had a,
have a gap in my education to fill.

41
00:02:51,231 --> 00:02:55,770
So start reading a deeply in them,
uh,

42
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,910
my education in some ways was a broad in
the history of philosophy but narrow at 

43
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,280
the graduate school level than I focused
mostly on annual American philosophy.

44
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:10,480
So my understanding of the continental 
traditions was quite limited,

45
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,900
but by the time I got to the end of the 
nineties,

46
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,930
uh,
I realized there was something 

47
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,701
significant going on coming out of 
continental philosophy and that's where 

48
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,210
the book came out.

49
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,390
When you say significant,
do you mean what do you mean by that?

50
00:03:26,391 --> 00:03:28,580
You mean intellectually do you mean 
socially?

51
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:33,581
Politically,
there's lots of different variants of 

52
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:33,581
significant

53
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:34,880
at that point,
intellectually this is still the 1990,

54
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:39,540
so postmodernism was not yet outside of 
say are a,

55
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,580
a cultural wars.
But it was strongly an intellectual 

56
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,301
force in that at that point,
a young phds coming out of sociology,

57
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,640
a literary criticism,
some subdisciplines in the law,

58
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,820
you're getting paid,
he's in the law,

59
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,120
historiography and so on.
And certainly in a departments in 

60
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:05,340
philosophy still dominated by 
continental,

61
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,370
traditional,
provocative,

62
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,430
uh,
that almost all of them are primarily 

63
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,351
being schooled in what we now call 
postmodern thinkers.

64
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,870
So the leading gurus are people like a 
leotard from whom we get the label,

65
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:25,560
postmodern condition,
Fuko and,

66
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,820
and the others.

67
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,060
Maybe you could walk us through what you
learn because people are unfamiliar.

68
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:34,060
I mean,
you had,

69
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,760
you had,
you were advanced in your education,

70
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,880
including in philosophy and still 
recognized your ignorance say with 

71
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:46,891
regards to postmodern thinking.
And so that's obviously a condition 

72
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:49,330
that's shared by a very large number of 
people and postmodernism is one of those

73
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,870
words like existentialism that covers an
awful lot of territory and sober.

74
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,500
Maybe we could zero in on exactly what 
that means and who these thinkers were,

75
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,740
Derrida,
Gluco,

76
00:04:58,741 --> 00:05:01,930
and who you are and what you learned 
about them.

77
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:02,400
Okay.
Yeah.

78
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:02,700
Fair enough.

79
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,690
Well,
all of the things you just named,

80
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:12,170
they think broadly,
they think strategically and they do 

81
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,471
have a very strong historical 
perspective on their disciplines and at 

82
00:05:15,471 --> 00:05:18,660
the same time they are trying to assess 
where they think we are culturally,

83
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:20,040
politically,
socially,

84
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,050
and all of them are making a very,
uh,

85
00:05:22,051 --> 00:05:27,051
dramatic claim that to some extent or in
some way modernism has either ended or 

86
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:34,610
it has reached its major right or all of
the kind of the pack,

87
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:37,120
apologies and negative traits,
uh,

88
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,200
within the modern world are reaching a 
culmination in their generation.

89
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,900
And so it's time for us to both 
recognize that modernism has come to an 

90
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,761
end,
that we need some sort of new 

91
00:05:52,761 --> 00:05:55,191
intellectual framework.
A post modern framework isn't

92
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,970
that they're criticizing what,
how would you carry that?

93
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,930
That's it.
That's the enlightenment values.

94
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:02,960
That's scientific rationalism.
How would you characterize it?

95
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,200
Exactly right.
Elements of it.

96
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,910
So of course there are some discipline 
specific differences.

97
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:12,650
So literature,
people in philosophy,

98
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:16,070
people and the historians will use 
modernism slightly differently.

99
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,790
But the idea of core is that if you look
at the mortem world,

100
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,430
essentially the world of the Middle Ages
saying that that was a itself broken up 

101
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:34,421
by a series of revolutions,
the renaissance reformation and counter 

102
00:06:34,421 --> 00:06:38,281
reformation,
early scientific revolutions and all of 

103
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:40,550
this is going on in a historic or short 
chunks of time.

104
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,610
15 hundreds and 16 hundreds.
And so if you look at the both the 

105
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:49,200
intellectual world and the social world,
uh,

106
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,970
comparing,
say the 14 hundreds with the 17 hundreds

107
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:58,450
culturally and intellectually you're in 
a different universe actually at that 

108
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,010
point.
So the features then of the,

109
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:01,340
of the modern world.

110
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,790
And now I'm going to use my 
philosophical labels here are that we're

111
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,840
now natural listing,
right in our thinking that we were no 

112
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,670
longer primarily supernatural mistake in
our thinking.

113
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:19,090
So we might still be open to the idea 
that there's a god or some sort of 

114
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,270
supernatural dimension like the way 
deists are.

115
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,020
But first and foremost,
we're taking the natural world as a more

116
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:29,021
or less self contained self governing 
world that operate supporting the cause 

117
00:07:29,021 --> 00:07:33,821
and effect.
And we're going to study it and its 

118
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:36,101
terms,
but we're not seeing the natural world 

119
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:36,101
as a derivative,
right?

120
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:40,961
Have a higher world or that everything 
that happens in the natural world is a 

121
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:45,730
part of God's plan.
And we read omens and so forth into 

122
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,301
everything.
So metaphysically then where there's 

123
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:52,120
been a revolution will naturalistic 
epistemologically in terms of knowledge.

124
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:57,311
There also has been a revolution,
a how do we know the important truths 

125
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,890
that require the beliefs that were 
fundamentally going to commit our lives 

126
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,730
to four by the time we become modern,
we,

127
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,740
uh,
we take experience seriously personal 

128
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:09,740
experience.

129
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,410
We do that more rigorously and we're 
developing and scientific method,

130
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:18,060
the way of organizing the data.
We're taking logic and all of the 

131
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,061
sophisticated tools of rationality and 
developing those increasingly.

132
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,290
And so our,
our,

133
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:28,291
our opposition then is either you know,
something because you can experience it 

134
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,961
and verify it for yourself or we've done
the hard work of scientific method a and

135
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:38,261
as a result of what comes out of that,
that's what we can call knowledge or 

136
00:08:38,261 --> 00:08:41,180
best approximation to that.
So revolutionary.

137
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,920
Let me just say one more thing because 
the prior intellectual framework,

138
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:50,921
right,
was much more intellectually 

139
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:51,320
authoritarian in the framework,
right?

140
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,950
So you would accept in the Catholic 
tradition the authority of the church,

141
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,190
right,
and who are you to question the 

142
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,691
authority of the church and who are you 
to mount empirical rational arguments 

143
00:09:02,691 --> 00:09:06,750
are against the authority of the church,
or you take the authority of scripture,

144
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,300
right?
Or you accept on faith that you've had a

145
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:14,301
mystical revelation of some sort.
So in all of those cases you have non 

146
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:18,681
rational epistemologies that are 
dominating intellectual discourse that 

147
00:09:18,681 --> 00:09:20,780
is all buying logs swept away by the,
in the,

148
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,960
in the modern world.

149
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:22,790
Okay.
So,

150
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:26,500
so prior to the emergence of the modern 
world,

151
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,540
in the same people are dominated 
essentially by their willingness to 

152
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,091
adhere to a shared tradition.
And now shared tradition is somewhat 

153
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:37,570
tyrannical enforced,
but there's no real alternative in terms

154
00:09:37,571 --> 00:09:39,130
of epistemology,
let's say.

155
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:44,550
And then as the modern world emerges,
people discovered the technologies of 

156
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,171
science and the value of rigorously 
applied method and the comparison of 

157
00:09:50,171 --> 00:09:52,960
shared experiences.
And that makes us technologically,

158
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,200
technologically powerful and in a new 
way and philosophically different from 

159
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,540
what we were before.

160
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,640
Yes,
the assured tradition praise that,

161
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:02,720
uh,
that you added there,

162
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:07,721
that's an important one.
So I would say in the early modern 

163
00:10:07,721 --> 00:10:10,421
world,
there's not necessarily a skepticism 

164
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:12,551
about assured traditions of students.
So it would be an acceptance of shared 

165
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:15,970
conditions.
The idea is that you would not 

166
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,020
uncritically accept your tradition,
that you will accept the tradition,

167
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:23,021
but only have two.
You've thought it through the major own 

168
00:10:23,021 --> 00:10:23,021
Independent.
Okay.

169
00:10:23,021 --> 00:10:26,930
So you're elevated to the status of 
someone who's capable of taking a stance

170
00:10:26,931 --> 00:10:29,960
with regards to the,
to the tradition and assessing.

171
00:10:29,961 --> 00:10:34,961
It's pretty sad.
So there's an elevation of the 

172
00:10:34,961 --> 00:10:37,160
individual and the critical intellect 
alone along with the,

173
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,510
with the elaboration of the scientific 
method.

174
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:45,770
Okay.
So then then we might know perhaps that 

175
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,520
that's a tremendously effective 
transformation,

176
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,400
although maybe it leads in a somewhat 
nihilistic direction.

177
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:51,330
Metaphysically we can leave that to the 
side,

178
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,350
but it's a very,
very successful revolution because by 

179
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,231
the time,
at least the beginning of the 20th 

180
00:10:59,231 --> 00:10:59,270
century comes along.
There's this staggering.

181
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,190
And of course,
before that,

182
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:06,220
the industrial revolution,
there's this staggering transformation 

183
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,011
of technology and technological and 
conceptual power and then a stunning 

184
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:14,621
increase in the standard of living and 
that starts at about 1890 to really to 

185
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:16,730
move exponentially in the eighties,
nineties,

186
00:11:16,731 --> 00:11:18,230
or,
or at least to get to the really,

187
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,100
really steep part of the exit ex 
exponential curve.

188
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,200
Okay.
So that seems to be going well.

189
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:27,110
So what is it that the postmodernists 
are objecting to?

190
00:11:27,111 --> 00:11:27,740
Precisely?

191
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:29,940
Well,
by the time,

192
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,000
just on those two issues,
um,

193
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,300
the metaphysical naturalism and then 
the,

194
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:40,301
uh,
the elevation of critical empiricists 

195
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:42,690
and a belief that we can through science
and,

196
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:46,410
uh,
even not necessarily a science,

197
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,440
the social scientists and so on,
come to understand powerful general 

198
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,530
principles about humanity and social 
systems.

199
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,770
Those two revolutions both are then 
subjected to counter attacks.

200
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,790
Uh,
and again,

201
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,020
uh,
what happens in this case is there was a

202
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:07,000
revolution,
uh,

203
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,360
probably by the time we get to 1800,
the height of the enlightenment or the 

204
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,741
beginnings of more powerful skeptical 
traditions that they come to be 

205
00:12:16,741 --> 00:12:20,751
developed.
So the thinkers are starting to say 

206
00:12:20,751 --> 00:12:20,751
things like,
well,

207
00:12:20,751 --> 00:12:24,200
you know,
if a scientific method is based on the 

208
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,110
evidence of the senses that we,
uh,

209
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,510
we observed the natural world,
that's our first point of contact,

210
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:34,190
and then on the basis of that reform,
have distractions and we put those apps 

211
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,830
integrated into a propositions and then 
we take a propositions and put them in 

212
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,820
networks that we call theories and so 
on.

213
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:45,180
So we start to critically examine each 
of the elements of scientific method and

214
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,000
over time,
uh,

215
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,040
weaknesses in the existing accounts of 
how all of those rational operations 

216
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,540
work come to be teased out.
And philosophy then starts to go down a 

217
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,740
more skeptical path.
So if,

218
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:02,710
for example,
you take perception,

219
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,410
uh,
as fundamental as our,

220
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,360
you know,
the individual subjects,

221
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,030
first point of contact with the natural 
world,

222
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:15,570
then you have to immediately deal with 
issues of a perceptual illusions for the

223
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:22,021
possibility that people will have 
hallucinations or that the way you 

224
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:27,361
report your perceptual experience is at 
odds with how I report my perceptual 

225
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:30,610
experiences.
So we have all

226
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,630
tell me if I've got this right.
So with the dawning of the empirical 

227
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,510
age,
let's say there's this idea that you can

228
00:13:38,511 --> 00:13:41,690
derive valid information from sensor 
data,

229
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,920
especially if you contrast that sense 
data rigorously without others.

230
00:13:45,921 --> 00:13:47,930
Okay.
So that's sort of the foundation for the

231
00:13:47,931 --> 00:13:52,931
scientific method in some sense.
But then I think this is with manual 

232
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:53,270
con,
there's an objection to that,

233
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,300
which is that while you can't make the 
presupposition that that sense data 

234
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,580
enters your cognitive apparatus,
your apparatus of understanding without 

235
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,481
a prior restructuring,
it seems to me that that's where the 

236
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:08,160
postmodernists really go after the 
modernists.

237
00:14:08,161 --> 00:14:13,161
It's that given that you have to have a,
a very complex perceptual structure that

238
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:18,401
modern people might say was instantiated
as a consequence of biological 

239
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:19,640
evolution.
You can't make the case that what you're

240
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:22,730
receiving from the external world is 
something like peer information.

241
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,760
It's always subject to some very 
difficult to delimit degree to 

242
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,760
interpretation.
And then you also have to take into 

243
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,301
account the fact that about a 
restructure and what it might mean for 

244
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:39,620
your concept of objective reality.
And that's con.

245
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,390
I think if I've got that right.

246
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,060
Well,
the postmoderns,

247
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,810
we'll use both of those strategies,
the,

248
00:14:44,811 --> 00:14:49,811
uh,
the strategy and the rationalist 

249
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:53,290
strategy.
And what's important about con right is 

250
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:53,290
that cloud is integrating,
right?

251
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,180
Both of those and by strategy.
So in the generations before Khan,

252
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,530
the,
uh,

253
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,850
the skeptical arguments about perception
by directed against the empiricists,

254
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:05,660
you just want to say everything is based
on observational data,

255
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,080
but then if you don't have good answers 
about hallucinations and relativity and 

256
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,080
illusions,
right,

257
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,730
and so forth,
and it seems like your structure,

258
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,990
intellectual structure,
whatever it comes to be,

259
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:20,991
it,
it's all based on probabilistic or 

260
00:15:20,991 --> 00:15:21,790
possibly faulty perceptual data than the
whole thing is a,

261
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,850
is a tottering mess.
And by the time we get to con,

262
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,560
the appearance is tradition is a largely
unable to respond to those kinds of 

263
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,750
objections.
And so contract recognizing and saying,

264
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:40,751
all right,
we've been trying now for a couple of 

265
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:43,000
centuries,
we haven't been able to do so 

266
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,000
successfully,
uh,

267
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,000
we're not going to be able to do so.

268
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,050
Now.
You also nicely right,

269
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,760
emphasize that one of the other,
the other response.

270
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:51,080
So it had been on the rationalist solid,
which is to say,

271
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:52,390
well,
no,

272
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,400
you don't start with pure empirical data
instead that we do have perhaps some 

273
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,520
innate,
a priori structures built into the human

274
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:02,570
mind,
how they got there.

275
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:06,050
Maybe they're put there by God,
maybe they're put there naturalistically

276
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:07,850
regular or whatever.
Uh,

277
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,760
but what enables us to have legitimate 
knowledge,

278
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:15,761
right,
is that our empirical data comes in and 

279
00:16:15,761 --> 00:16:19,460
it is filtered and structured by these 
preexisting right cognitive structures 

280
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:23,820
as well.
The problem with that side of the line,

281
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,170
and this is also well worked out by the 
time we get to the content,

282
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:32,171
is the same world.
If you're starting with inbuilt 

283
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:34,220
cognitive structures and everything that
comes in so to speak,

284
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:38,600
goes through the structural machine and 
you're aware of the outputs.

285
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,880
It goes.
That's what's presented to your mind.

286
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:46,390
Well,
how do you know that those inbuilt 

287
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,650
structures I have anything to do with 
the way reality actually is out there.

288
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:49,910
It seems.
I've been.

289
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:54,911
What you are stuck with is the end 
result of a subjective processing and 

290
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,070
there is no way for you,
so to speak,

291
00:16:58,071 --> 00:17:03,071
to jump outside of your head or to 
compare it to end result with the way 

292
00:17:03,071 --> 00:17:07,181
the world actually is our independently 
of how your mind has structured the 

293
00:17:07,181 --> 00:17:08,450
awareness.
So once again,

294
00:17:08,451 --> 00:17:12,560
you're struck stuck rather in a rather 
subjective place and again,

295
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:17,561
the importance of contours and he's also
looking at this more rationalist 

296
00:17:17,561 --> 00:17:17,990
tradition and he's saying,
well look again,

297
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:22,991
we've been trying now for a couple of 
centuries to work these things out here 

298
00:17:22,991 --> 00:17:26,110
from descartes who spinosa lightness in 
the others and rationalism also has 

299
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:30,350
reached a dead end.
So we're not going to be able to do so.

300
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,460
So conference in effect standing at the 
end of these two traditions and saying,

301
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:35,360
you know,
uh,

302
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:38,420
the skeptics have it right on both 
sides.

303
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,420
The empiricists and the rationalist 
tradition fail.

304
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:46,750
There is no way for us to objectively 
come to know and external reality 

305
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,590
restructuring some sort of subjectivism.

306
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:55,270
Okay.
So I don't know now whether to talk a 

307
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,211
little bit of Rote American pragmatic 
approach to that or whether to maybe we 

308
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:02,321
should go ahead and continue our 
discussion of the postmodernist because 

309
00:18:02,321 --> 00:18:02,900
they're developing these claims.

310
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:08,170
Absolutely.
And some of the postmodernists who 

311
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:08,870
describe themselves as neo pragmatist,
Richard Horton for example.

312
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:13,871
So yes,
that's exactly the direction it's worth 

313
00:18:13,871 --> 00:18:13,871
going.

314
00:18:13,871 --> 00:18:13,871
Okay.
Okay.

315
00:18:13,871 --> 00:18:16,420
So my,
my understanding of that,

316
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,760
if I was going to defend the modernist 
tradition,

317
00:18:18,761 --> 00:18:21,770
let's say,
I would say that we,

318
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:27,250
we have instantiated within us an a 
priority perceptual structure that's a 

319
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,901
consequence of millions,
billions of years for that matter of 

320
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,170
biological evolution.
And yet it is,

321
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,560
it has emerged in tandem with continual 
correction of its presuppositions by,

322
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:42,930
by the selection process,
but it's still subject to error because 

323
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,020
we have a very limited viewpoint as 
specific individuals.

324
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,940
And we can,
we can,

325
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,940
not only are we limited,
but we also make,

326
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:56,440
you might say moral errors and I'll get 
back to that cloud our judgment.

327
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,040
And so in an attempt to,
um,

328
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:03,160
expand our purview and rectify those 
errors,

329
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:08,161
we do two things.
We test our hypothesis practically 

330
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:08,980
against the world,
which is to say we say,

331
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,630
here's a theory of reality.
We acted out if the theory of reality is

332
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:17,631
sufficiently correct when we acted out,
we get what we want and then that's 

333
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,360
sufficient proof for the validity of the
theory.

334
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,310
It's not absolute proof,
but it's sufficient proof.

335
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:24,760
And then the other thing we do,
and I think this has been paid attention

336
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:27,250
to much less except by thinkers such as 
piaget,

337
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,180
is that we further constrain our 
presumptions,

338
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,240
presuppositions about reality with the 
necessity of constructing theories that 

339
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,891
are also acceptable to people around us,
so they have to be integratable within 

340
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,850
the,
the currently existing social contract,

341
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:50,910
and they have to be functionally 
appropriate in the external world.

342
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,430
And that's a nice set of constraints.
And it seems to me that that at least in

343
00:19:54,431 --> 00:19:59,431
some part goes along ways to answering 
the objections to the,

344
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,790
to the limits of the scientific method 
that had been discussed,

345
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:09,180
that were discussed and that you just 
discussed that had been discussed 

346
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:09,180
historically that you just summarized.

347
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:15,730
Uh,
I'm sympathetic too much of what you 

348
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,581
went through.
The five point like a response to the 

349
00:20:18,581 --> 00:20:20,600
kinds of arguments that have been played
out,

350
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:25,870
but you're actually putting me in a 
position then of the defending the 

351
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,080
postmodern condition,
right,

352
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:30,020
about how it would undercut each of 
those components.

353
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,430
So if you take for example,
a evolutionary epistemology and you give

354
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:38,940
a nice sketch of one standard 
evolutionary epistemological framing,

355
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,470
which we said,
okay,

356
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,860
maybe we have these Infield,
a priority structures,

357
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:48,000
but we can rely upon them because here 
we are standing at the long end of,

358
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:48,600
uh,
you know,

359
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,750
uh,
hundreds of thousands or millions of 

360
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,680
years of evolution and they would not 
have survived or enabled us to survive 

361
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,440
had they not serve some sort of reliable
cognitive role in accurately 

362
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,550
representing the way that it works with 
the,

363
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,700
uh,
the postmodern.

364
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,720
Uh,
this is actually too early for the 

365
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:11,720
postmodern.

366
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,610
Postmodern will agree with this is to 
say all of that kind of begs the 

367
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,940
question right in a very deep way 
against the kind of skeptical objections

368
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:23,941
that we're raising.
Because in order to make that paragraph 

369
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:27,880
long description of what evolutionary 
epistemology is,

370
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,200
what I have to do is take for granted as
basic assumptions,

371
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,830
certain truth right about the world that
for example,

372
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,540
there is an external world,
right,

373
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:43,980
that we are biological creatures that we
have in built structures,

374
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:49,790
that those structures are evolutionarily
responsive and conditioning by changing 

375
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:56,510
forces like and so forth,
and if you take those assumptions right 

376
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,950
to be true,
then as a consequence or inclusion,

377
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:05,100
you can infer that therefore the 
intellectual products that come out of 

378
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:11,230
our cognitive processing or reliable 
right in some way,

379
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:16,120
but where did you get those for premises
from?

380
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,910
How do you know?
Right?

381
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,450
That there was an extra in a world.

382
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:22,660
How do you know that we are biological 
creatures?

383
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:28,020
How do you know for that evolution is 
true with all of the historical 

384
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,420
knowledge is necessary to reach the 
conclusion that evolution is true.

385
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:36,690
All of that presupposes that we have 
legitimate cognitive methods become to 

386
00:22:37,991 --> 00:22:42,991
understand the world,
but our having legitimate cognitive 

387
00:22:42,991 --> 00:22:45,550
processes understand the world.
That's exactly what we are arguing about

388
00:22:45,551 --> 00:22:50,170
in the first place and you can't just 
assume that right for the sake of coming

389
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:55,171
up with some premises that are then in 
turn going to validate those cognitive 

390
00:22:55,171 --> 00:22:58,120
processes.
So something like that or say is there's

391
00:22:58,121 --> 00:22:59,410
a,
there's a big circle,

392
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,520
a circular reasoning problem that the 
evolutionary epistemology find some 

393
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:10,890
crap.
Then now I think there are some 

394
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,680
responses to that and this is just the 
first back and forth,

395
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:16,681
right on that particular debate,
but that is the kind of response that 

396
00:23:16,681 --> 00:23:16,681
will be there.

397
00:23:16,681 --> 00:23:21,020
So the third and fourth are keeping 
track accurately is to say that we also 

398
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,120
have a constraints,
right,

399
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,480
with respect to,
to ourselves,

400
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,980
uh,
that if we have a certain set of 

401
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,310
hypotheses are certainly fatal theories 
and we're testing them out,

402
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:38,790
uh,
we will accept those that give us what 

403
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:38,790
we want.
That's sort of what I want.

404
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:43,270
So the street and I'm also necessarily 
in a social situation.

405
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:46,490
So what you to do is check my results 
against the,

406
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:47,620
uh,
the results of others.

407
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,610
Purely review,
experiment,

408
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:51,290
replication,
like and so forth.

409
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,930
Or we live in the same household.
Yes,

410
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:55,970
absolutely right.
More prosaically,

411
00:23:55,971 --> 00:23:58,730
right?
A sharing our frameworks right with each

412
00:23:58,731 --> 00:23:59,180
other,
right.

413
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:01,730
And so on.
And so if so to speak,

414
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,790
uh,
and this is the more pragmatist 

415
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,240
orientation.
If we then say we have a theory or a set

416
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:13,241
of principles or guidelines or whatever,
and they do enable me successful,

417
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,130
you navigate the world or to get what I 
want,

418
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,970
or they do enable me to navigate my 
social world.

419
00:24:19,971 --> 00:24:24,971
We get us what we want.
Then they're reliable crew or some sort 

420
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:27,960
of a success label epistomological that 
we're going.

421
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:33,860
Okay.
So let me ask you a question about this 

422
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,810
is a place where I got honored and very 
badly with a Sam Harris.

423
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,000
We were discussing metaphysical 
presumption.

424
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:39,480
So you know,
and,

425
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:44,660
and I'm confused about this.
I would say to some degree conceptually 

426
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:44,660
because I'm,
I'm an,

427
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,640
I'm a scientist and certainly operate 
most of the time under the 

428
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,940
presupposition of an independent 
objective world.

429
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:54,830
But then I also have some difficulty 
with the idea that objective truth.

430
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,060
It's that it's objective truth within 
which all other truths are nested.

431
00:24:59,061 --> 00:25:04,061
And that's something that Sam and and 
the people that he represents in some 

432
00:25:04,061 --> 00:25:06,350
sense are very dead set on insisting.
Now,

433
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:11,410
it seems to me though that the crux of 
the matter is something like the method 

434
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:16,451
of proof and districts me is very 
important because my theory is correct 

435
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,080
enough if when I implemented,
I get what I want is not the same as the

436
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:23,840
claim.

437
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,840
My theory is true because it's in 
accordance with some independently 

438
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,760
existing objective world.
I mean both of those things can exist at

439
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:36,761
the same time,
but I think the more appropriate claim 

440
00:25:36,761 --> 00:25:40,480
to make with regards to human knowledge 
is something like it's biological 

441
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,201
functionality,
which is that your knowledge is of 

442
00:25:44,201 --> 00:25:46,310
sufficient accuracy,
which is about the best you can hope for

443
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:51,311
because of your fundamental ignorance.
If when you implemented it reliably 

444
00:25:51,311 --> 00:25:55,991
produces the results that are 
commensurate say with your continued 

445
00:25:55,991 --> 00:25:59,501
existence.
Now it seems to me that that's a 

446
00:25:59,501 --> 00:25:59,501
reasonable claim from a Darwinian 
perspective.

447
00:25:59,501 --> 00:26:04,151
And it also seems to me that it's very 
much in keeping with the claims of the 

448
00:26:04,151 --> 00:26:05,560
American pragmatists.
And I mean,

449
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,990
it's not like they were radical 
postmodernists because they weren't,

450
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:14,140
but they were trying to solve this 
problem to some degree of our 

451
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:18,191
fundamental ignorance and our,
our inability to be certain about the 

452
00:26:18,191 --> 00:26:18,980
nature of the reality that surrounds us.

453
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:24,420
Okay.
Let's set aside a Sam Harris's a version

454
00:26:24,421 --> 00:26:27,810
of this and focus on the pragmatist 
Reggie tradition here.

455
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,490
So No,
you're absolutely right.

456
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,560
A William James,
John Dewey,

457
00:26:31,561 --> 00:26:32,350
right?
And the others,

458
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,650
late 19th century,
early 20th century.

459
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:40,130
They are coming a century after the 
content revolution after ideally ism,

460
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,420
uh,
and so forth.

461
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:50,421
And so they are very much trying to 
solve this problem one way.

462
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:53,140
And this is a very American right sort 
of things to say.

463
00:26:53,141 --> 00:26:58,141
Look,
maybe the problem with philosophy is 

464
00:26:58,141 --> 00:27:01,371
that we have been to like intellectual 
ising like cognition that we're not just

465
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:09,040
embodies.
Brains are disembodied minds that are 

466
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,820
trying to kind of contemplate abstract 
in some other realm.

467
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,980
Maybe what we need to do is understand 
right?

468
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:20,030
The mind and cognition as a naturalistic
process and that the purpose of 

469
00:27:20,581 --> 00:27:25,050
knowledge is not to come up with these 
pure and beautiful truths that are going

470
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:28,110
to be kind of museum pieces that we will
admire her,

471
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,760
but rather the purpose of knowledge is 
functional.

472
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,430
The purpose of knowledge is to guide 
action.

473
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,680
Uh,
and so they will then harking back to 

474
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,540
the earlier they konijn traditional the 
knowledge knowledge is not an end in 

475
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,080
itself,
but as they can afford it.

476
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:51,410
A Francis Bacon,
a knowledge is power and by its fruits,

477
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,680
right?
So to speak,

478
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,400
you know it's worth.
And so what we then should do is to see 

479
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,351
that the chest of crew is not like 
whether it meets purely intellectual 

480
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:11,271
standards of logic and mathematics,
but rather when we put it to practice 

481
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:17,721
and then we act upon it,
we actually get good results or we get 

482
00:28:17,721 --> 00:28:22,221
the results we want or I get the results
I will become and more individualistic 

483
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:24,920
form or more socialized,

484
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,390
right?
Because then we can get on.

485
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,520
That's ignorance in some sense.

486
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,510
So there's two things that are being 
packaged here,

487
00:28:31,511 --> 00:28:36,511
right?
One is to say that knowledge right is 

488
00:28:36,511 --> 00:28:37,400
functional and that part I think is 
important.

489
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:41,150
I think it's a very nice correction or 
the pragmatists are,

490
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:46,151
it's not original with them,
but they are re emphasizing that in the 

491
00:28:46,151 --> 00:28:49,601
19th century,
knowledge needs to be pushed to the 

492
00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:49,601
test.
Uh,

493
00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:52,010
and uh,
it's ability to do,

494
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,330
enable us to,
uh,

495
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:58,450
to be pragmatic,
but so to speak in the real world is a 

496
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:58,450
test.

497
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:03,860
Then there's a code to data as well.
And I think this is relevant to Thomas 

498
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:09,370
Kuhn's discussion of scientific 
revolutions because code is often read 

499
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,800
as positing a sequence of,
in some sense discontinuous revolutions.

500
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,500
But if you,
if you and,

501
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,040
and,
and,

502
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:19,970
and that the conceptual structure that 
characterized one epoch,

503
00:29:19,971 --> 00:29:24,971
let's say like the Medieval Lee Park was
so totally different and it's 

504
00:29:25,341 --> 00:29:28,190
presuppositions from the conceptions 
that characterize the next.

505
00:29:28,191 --> 00:29:31,160
He parked that,
that you can't even mediate between them

506
00:29:31,161 --> 00:29:36,161
in some sense.
And now the reason I'm bringing this up 

507
00:29:36,161 --> 00:29:38,921
is because coon is at least read as 
hypothesizing that there's not any 

508
00:29:38,921 --> 00:29:42,640
necessary progress when you make leaps 
from one conceptual system to another.

509
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,600
But if you take this pragmatic approach,
the one that we've been outlining,

510
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:48,790
it seems to me that you can say,
well,

511
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:53,890
something like this,
your conceptions of the world are more 

512
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:58,831
tool like than objective truth,
light and tools can have a greater or 

513
00:29:59,021 --> 00:30:00,820
lesser range of convenience.

514
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,120
And so if you come up with a really good
tool which would also be something that 

515
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:06,850
would look objectively true,
generally speaking,

516
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:12,150
then that's something that you can use 
in almost every situation and it will 

517
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:15,391
never fail.
You and I would think of something like 

518
00:30:15,391 --> 00:30:18,061
Newtonian physics and in that regard,
or even more particularly quantum 

519
00:30:18,061 --> 00:30:22,380
mechanics because it's never failed us 
and so it seems to me the pragmatic 

520
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,970
approach in some sense allows you to 
have your cake and eat it too.

521
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,150
You can pause it,
a hierarchy of truths,

522
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:32,160
moving towards an absolute truth even,
but also retain your belief in your own 

523
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,991
ignorance and not have to beat the drum 
too hard about the like what eternal 

524
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:40,210
accuracy of your objective 
presuppositions.

525
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,180
Okay.

526
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,330
Again,
I'm sympathetic.

527
00:30:44,331 --> 00:30:49,331
I think with about 80 percent of that,
but let me put my skeptical hat back on 

528
00:30:51,081 --> 00:30:51,660
and say,
well,

529
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,680
how the postmoderns or the critics of 
pragmatism for first generation 

530
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,960
pragmatism will respond to that.
So if we then say,

531
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,310
right,
all of these,

532
00:31:01,311 --> 00:31:05,250
uh,
cognitive results and to rephrase,

533
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,820
so we're going to assess all of our 
cognitive,

534
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:14,120
uh,
results or cognitive hypotheses in terms

535
00:31:14,121 --> 00:31:19,121
of their work with unity or they're 
getting what I want or what we want.

536
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,920
Well,
then the big question we have to turn to

537
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:22,730
is to say,
well,

538
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:27,820
how do we judge whether something works 
or say that it's good because I get what

539
00:31:33,411 --> 00:31:35,990
I want.
We get what we want,

540
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,410
what is a want,
right?

541
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:43,420
And where do these wants come from and 
why should we accept wants and desires 

542
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,560
and,
uh,

543
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,800
achieving certain goals as our bottom 
line,

544
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,430
so to speak.
Great.

545
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:52,750
Okay.
So that's right.

546
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,780
So you can start to question the 
framework,

547
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,900
the framework within which you're 
constructing the answer.

548
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:03,290
That's where I end at this point,
we're leading epistemology right 

549
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:03,540
neutrally,
so to speak,

550
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:08,541
and moving into normative issues.
And so the whole status of normative,

551
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,210
uh,
goals and,

552
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,680
and then the means that are going to 
enable us to reach,

553
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,920
reach rather those ends comes into play.
So if I want to say the it's important 

554
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,830
thing is that I put it very baldly here,
right?

555
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,080
I get,
I want,

556
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:29,490
right?
And I'm going to assess intellectual 

557
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,741
structures and beliefs and hypotheses in
terms of do they give me what I want?

558
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:36,130
Well,
that already sounds like a fairly,

559
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,980
uh,
normatively subjectivist standpoint.

560
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:45,580
Why should you take your wants as having
some sort of high status it,

561
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:50,970
everything has to be evaluated in terms 
of a.

562
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,940
and then philosophically,
then we say,

563
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,330
well,
where'd wants come from?

564
00:32:54,331 --> 00:32:57,000
And forces along anthropological,
psychological,

565
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,650
that set of literature a here,
what,

566
00:32:59,651 --> 00:33:01,730
what's the relationship of our ones?

567
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,730
Are they based in biological drives or 
the instinctual or they acquired or the 

568
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:11,951
intellectual.
Do they have any relationship to our 

569
00:33:11,951 --> 00:33:15,521
rational capacities when I'm acting?
Should I act on my desires and my wants,

570
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:16,580
my console?
So poor.

571
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:22,180
So there's that whole tradition and we 
have to have a sophisticated theory 

572
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:27,560
about how all of that is going to work.
If we're going to say we'll solve all 

573
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,850
these cognitive because the mechanical 
issues in terms of once or the 

574
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:36,251
satisfaction of desires or the 
achievement of goals the way private 

575
00:33:36,251 --> 00:33:38,090
does want us to do,
and again,

576
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,190
uh,
it's fairly easy to,

577
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,200
uh,
to imagine what the skeptical you're 

578
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,200
going to be,
right?

579
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:45,620
If it's a matter of what I want,
well,

580
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:49,430
isn't science supposed to be about 
coming up with general truths,

581
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,420
uh,
or,

582
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:55,421
or maybe even universal cruise.
And if we're immediately going to 

583
00:33:55,421 --> 00:33:57,210
devolve it to whatever individuals want,
well then we're going to be in there

584
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,240
fairly scattered because that also opens
up a good point for a segue into the 

585
00:34:03,061 --> 00:34:06,150
potential link between new Marxism,
let's say,

586
00:34:06,151 --> 00:34:11,151
and postmodernism,
because maybe you could say once you've 

587
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:14,240
opened the door to an admission that you
can criticize the,

588
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:18,360
the idea of want as a social construct,
let's say.

589
00:34:18,361 --> 00:34:20,070
Which is one of the things that you 
intimated,

590
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:25,130
nor the only thing obviously.
Then you open the door to also making 

591
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,450
the claim that,
that,

592
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:31,990
that social construct that governs the 
wants that governs the truth can be 

593
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:32,270
governed by power,
relationships.

594
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:35,730
Something like that.
And then by unfair power relationship so

595
00:34:35,731 --> 00:34:37,650
you can spin off down that aisle,
which,

596
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,810
and,
and that's the other thing I really want

597
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:42,240
to talk to you about is because on the 
one hand,

598
00:34:42,241 --> 00:34:47,241
the postmodernists are following this 
intellectual tradition of the critique 

599
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:48,180
of,
of western thinking,

600
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:51,780
which is exactly in some sense what 
philosophy should be doing,

601
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:57,050
but in another way they seemed 
simultaneously to be introducing almost 

602
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:01,431
by sleight of hand,
I kind of social critique that has its 

603
00:35:01,431 --> 00:35:03,180
origin more in political revolution and 
class based theory.

604
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:08,181
And they do that.
They do that under the guise of pure 

605
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:12,261
philosophy in some sense.
But with the intent and motivation of 

606
00:35:12,261 --> 00:35:14,910
something like justifying the social 
revolution or continuing the Marxist,

607
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,640
the Marxist analysis of power 
differential.

608
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,640
It can go both ways.
Yes,

609
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,380
it is possible that follow the road that
we've just been going down to say,

610
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:23,870
well,
you know,

611
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,290
if it's a matter about,
uh,

612
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,230
you know,
what works for you,

613
00:35:27,231 --> 00:35:30,320
then that immediately starts to sound to
relativistic and subjectivist.

614
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,130
We don't have

615
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,900
an explanation or an answer rather to 
all the Weirdos want to do strange 

616
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:36,970
things because that's what they wanted 
to.

617
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,900
So we might introduce as a corrective a 
socializing right of the process.

618
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,500
So we might then say,
no,

619
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:45,750
it's not so much what you want as an 
individual,

620
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:50,040
but rather what we want and we need to 
achieve some sort of a consensus here.

621
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,980
So this is a slightly cartoon version 
here,

622
00:35:52,981 --> 00:35:57,981
but the difference between William James
who was more individualistic and John 

623
00:35:57,981 --> 00:35:59,560
Dewey in the next generation will 
collect advisors things,

624
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:04,570
right a little bit more.
So then we have a corrective on all of 

625
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,690
the individual Weirdos who knows what 
their desires and goals,

626
00:36:06,691 --> 00:36:08,130
right are going to be.
Right.

627
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,160
But anyway,
just to confront the same problem there 

628
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:13,170
as soon as we start doing anthropology 
because then if we say,

629
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:18,171
well,
if we relativize it to the social group 

630
00:36:18,171 --> 00:36:18,171
and when we start looking at different 
social groups,

631
00:36:18,171 --> 00:36:22,971
obviously different social groups have 
dramatically different wants and needs 

632
00:36:22,971 --> 00:36:24,390
and desires and evolve very different 
traditions.

633
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:29,930
And if it's a matter of saying what's 
true is what works for the group,

634
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,840
uh,
there is then no sorta speak Uber Group,

635
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:34,950
right,
or,

636
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:39,951
or highest group of all groups that has 
status overall of the others.

637
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:46,170
And if you do,
and this is the second point that you 

638
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:46,170
said,
right?

639
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:46,170
Exactly right.
Uh,

640
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,060
then you say,
well,

641
00:36:47,061 --> 00:36:47,480
no,
no,

642
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:51,900
this group's norms and goals are better 
than that group's goals,

643
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:55,310
or hey,
then you're into a,

644
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,080
what the critics are going to call 
imperialism,

645
00:36:58,081 --> 00:36:58,430
right?
Of,

646
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,160
uh,
of the,

647
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,990
of the Lgu,
inappropriate form,

648
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,760
right?
So that leaves us,

649
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,600
that leaves us with our current 
political situation in some sense,

650
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:09,000
which is because that's been,
it's been,

651
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,240
that idea has been taken to what,
to a logical conclusion.

652
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:18,690
And that logical conclusion has now been
instantiated to a large degree as a,

653
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:22,260
as an intellectual and political 
activist movement.

654
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:22,890
I would say that.

655
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,150
Sure,
absolutely.

656
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:29,270
So it can start as an intellectual 
movement that we're trying to do some 

657
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,300
hardcore epistemology,
right?

658
00:37:30,301 --> 00:37:35,301
And we go through the empiricism,
the rationalist and the content 

659
00:37:35,301 --> 00:37:35,520
revolution.
And the pragmatists are right now,

660
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:40,521
we're in the second generation 
pragmatism where we'd relativize 

661
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:43,071
relative to various kinds of groups and 
then we're just stuck in a kind of group

662
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,200
relativism and then the operational 
principles socially then is going to be 

663
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,170
that each group,
so to speak,

664
00:37:49,171 --> 00:37:54,171
should stick to itself and not think 
that it can impose its ideas and its 

665
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,160
norms on any.
Any other group.

666
00:37:56,161 --> 00:37:57,660
Right.
All groups so to speak,

667
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,260
are equal.

668
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,640
Yeah.
There was an equal claim to have an 

669
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,190
equal claim to their formulation of the 
truth.

670
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:10,610
The problem with the postmodern 
conjunction with neo Marxism to me,

671
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,430
seems to be the idea,
the acceptance of idea,

672
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:19,431
that there's an intrinsic moral claim by
the dispossessed to the,

673
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:25,100
to the obtaining of status,
and that actually constitutes a higher 

674
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,420
moral calling in and of itself.
So they're swallowing a moral claim that

675
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:30,720
it making it universal in some sense.
At the same time,

676
00:38:30,721 --> 00:38:34,710
they criticize the idea of say general 
narratives are universal moral claims.

677
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,100
Okay.
Now that's

678
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,640
also A.
Right.

679
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:41,660
So that's,
that's the other way rather than 

680
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:41,660
starting with epistemology.
Right.

681
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,120
In ending up getting into a kind of 
cultural relativism,

682
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:48,570
right?
You can start a course committed to a 

683
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,300
certain normative framework,
regular certain ideological framework,

684
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,650
uh,
as Marxism is where you're very critical

685
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:58,940
part of one of those traditions.
And then the cultural relativism can be 

686
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,070
right a part of that that you used to 
criticize the tradition,

687
00:39:02,071 --> 00:39:02,920
right?
Internal.

688
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,400
Now then we're explicitly into a not to 
met an ethics and asking where do we get

689
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:16,110
our ethical principles off the ground or
where do they come from in the first 

690
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:20,191
place,
but kind of a robust normative ethics 

691
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,710
where people have committed commitments 
rather to fairly strong ethical 

692
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:29,311
principles and ethical ideals.
And this is where there was a debate 

693
00:39:29,311 --> 00:39:33,951
between say Nisha and mark's becomes 
relevant and this is a late 19th century

694
00:39:35,161 --> 00:39:35,420
right?

695
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:38,580
Debate.
So I suppose we say as both the Marxists

696
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:43,730
who will do is say there is no proof in 
any objective sense.

697
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,360
And we said,
oh,

698
00:39:45,361 --> 00:39:50,150
we have the subjectivity in relativity 
regular very sorts and we have different

699
00:39:50,151 --> 00:39:55,151
individuals in different groups and they
are in antagonistic conflict,

700
00:39:56,211 --> 00:40:01,211
relationship with each other.
And that means there's not really going 

701
00:40:01,211 --> 00:40:01,920
to be any,
uh,

702
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:06,710
know rational and civil resolution of 
these discussions with each other.

703
00:40:06,711 --> 00:40:11,711
Instead,
it all comes down to power a sleight of 

704
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:14,740
hand claim there too,
because why?

705
00:40:14,741 --> 00:40:19,741
It has to come down to powers that seems
to introduce the necessary need.

706
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:21,710
Okay?
Yeah,

707
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,580
that's another thing.
We set that aside just for a moment,

708
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,990
uh,
but then we say,

709
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,550
okay,
so we have power,

710
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,620
right?
And one thing that we can say is,

711
00:40:30,621 --> 00:40:35,621
while we don't think any one individual,
any one group has a better objective 

712
00:40:36,921 --> 00:40:41,921
claim to truth or better ideals,
it is nonetheless the case that some 

713
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:46,460
individuals and groups have more power 
than others.

714
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:52,210
And so then we have to make our 
allegiance clear in this unequal power 

715
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:57,281
struggle.
Are we on the side of those who have 

716
00:40:57,281 --> 00:40:58,550
more power or are we on the side of 
those who have less power?

717
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,570
And that's where we get then a 
Nietzschean and Marxian that fork in the

718
00:41:02,571 --> 00:41:03,530
road,
right?

719
00:41:03,531 --> 00:41:05,750
So the nutrients following nature will 
say,

720
00:41:05,751 --> 00:41:07,060
look,
uh,

721
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,840
it's all about power.
Uh,

722
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:12,560
then we can try on some crude 
evolutionary thinking here.

723
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:16,310
It's only the exercise of power,
right by the stronger,

724
00:41:16,311 --> 00:41:17,870
the fitter,
healthier,

725
00:41:17,871 --> 00:41:22,871
and so forth that are willing to impose 
their power on the weaker and use them 

726
00:41:23,811 --> 00:41:27,530
for their own ends that we as 
individuals and groups are going to make

727
00:41:27,531 --> 00:41:30,020
any sort of progress toward the next 
best thing.

728
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,290
But whatever that is.
So in the power struggle,

729
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,730
there is no objective morality and 
objective truth,

730
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:42,790
uh,
we just throw our lot in with the 

731
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:42,790
stronger,
with the richer,

732
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:45,110
with the more powerful,
and they say whatever it is that they do

733
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:50,111
in order to advance themselves,
that's normative best that we can do 

734
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:50,630
better.

735
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,620
Of course,
there's a long,

736
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:54,170
kind of aristocratic tradition,
right?

737
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,720
Uh,
innovative thinking that one can draw on

738
00:41:56,721 --> 00:42:00,150
to support that.
And in a Marxist mattress rather,

739
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:02,000
of course it was on the other side of 
that equation,

740
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:04,100
right?
Where their sympathies,

741
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:06,340
right initially are going to be say,
you know,

742
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,440
in any power struggle,
our kind of a prior or I commitments 

743
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,680
that should always be to the weaker to 
those on the losing end or the pistol,

744
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:22,150
those who suffer and so forth.
And it's always the rich and powerful 

745
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:28,301
people who are oppressing and harming 
them and so we throw our lot in with the

746
00:42:28,491 --> 00:42:33,491
weaker and we're willing to use power 
whatever amount of power we have on 

747
00:42:33,491 --> 00:42:37,601
behalf of the weaker.
And then when we're just into what I 

748
00:42:37,601 --> 00:42:42,011
think of as the major false alternative 
that really has driven much of 20th 

749
00:42:42,011 --> 00:42:44,630
century with intellectual life.
Are you a nutrient or are you a Marxist?

750
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,670
Well,
okay,

751
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:51,671
so now we can get to the crux of the 
matter here to some degree because to 

752
00:42:51,671 --> 00:42:53,630
even engage in that argument means to 
accept the a priority position.

753
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:56,480
Which would you made quite rationally 
compelling?

754
00:42:56,481 --> 00:43:01,481
Let's say that its power,
its power because there's no other way 

755
00:43:01,481 --> 00:43:03,950
of differentiating between the claims of
different groups.

756
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,140
It's power.
That's the determining issue.

757
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:11,740
But yeah,
that that's something I really have a 

758
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,751
problem with and,
and I think it's crucial importance 

759
00:43:13,751 --> 00:43:14,150
because first of all,
I think there's a big difference between

760
00:43:14,151 --> 00:43:19,151
power.
There's a difference between power and 

761
00:43:19,151 --> 00:43:19,970
authority and competence.
Those are all not the same thing because

762
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:25,490
you might be willing to see greater 
status to me in some domains,

763
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:29,060
if there are things I can do that you 
value that you can't do,

764
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,370
and that's not power.
Exactly.

765
00:43:31,371 --> 00:43:36,050
Power seems to be more than I'm willing 
to use force to impose my interpretation

766
00:43:36,051 --> 00:43:38,390
of the world to get my wants fulfilled 
on you,

767
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,840
and it seems to me that were the 
Marxists make a huge mistake.

768
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,390
Not that the Nietzsche ends aren't 
making mistakes as well,

769
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:49,391
but for the Marxists make a huge mistake
is that they failed to properly 

770
00:43:49,391 --> 00:43:53,051
differentiate between hierarchies of 
interpretation that are predicated on 

771
00:43:53,051 --> 00:43:57,371
tyrannical power and hierarchies of 
interpretation that are predicated on 

772
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,320
authority,
confidence and mutual consent.

773
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:05,480
Because those and the other issue that 
they failed to contend with,

774
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,880
and I believe this is a form of willful 
blindness,

775
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:12,881
is that it isn't obviously the case that
every society is set up equally to only 

776
00:44:14,841 --> 00:44:19,841
fulfill the desires of the people who 
are in principle situated at the 

777
00:44:19,841 --> 00:44:24,521
pinnacles of the hierarchies.
I actually don't think that that's 

778
00:44:24,521 --> 00:44:27,401
fundamentally characteristic of the 
western tradition because it has a very 

779
00:44:27,401 --> 00:44:27,740
strong emphasis,
weirdly enough,

780
00:44:27,741 --> 00:44:32,741
and this is how I think it extracts 
itself out of the social socialized,

781
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:38,550
the conundrum that accepting a a 
socialized version of truth presents to 

782
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:39,000
you.

783
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:44,480
The West does two things.
It says we have a social contract that 

784
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,380
constraints are views of the world and 
our actions in it,

785
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:51,381
but that social contract is also 
simultaneously subordinate to the idea 

786
00:44:51,381 --> 00:44:55,341
of the sovereignty of each individual 
and so the social contract is bound to 

787
00:44:57,451 --> 00:45:01,890
serve the needs of each individual.
Not any privileged set of individuals.

788
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:06,891
Although sometimes it works out that way
and I don't believe that the postmodern 

789
00:45:06,891 --> 00:45:08,400
NSF contended with that properly with 
their.

790
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:11,310
With their criticism of logo centers and
for example,

791
00:45:11,311 --> 00:45:12,990
which was something that characterized 
data.

792
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,900
Because I think that that because it 
doesn't.

793
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:20,990
It never has seemed to me that what you 
had with Stalinist Russia and and the 

794
00:45:21,391 --> 00:45:26,391
Marxist view of the world and what you 
had on the side of the West was merely a

795
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:33,140
matter of a difference of opinion 
between two equally valid socialized 

796
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:33,690
modes of interpreting the world.

797
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:39,170
You know there's something wrong.
There's something more to the view of 

798
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:41,710
the West.
Then what's in battle,

799
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,270
what's embodied in the conflict between 
capitalism and socialism.

800
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:49,320
Because it could've just been a matter 
of argumentation and opinion.

801
00:45:49,321 --> 00:45:51,460
But I think that that's.
That's fault.

802
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,870
And I thought this way in part because 
of piaget,

803
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,340
because piaget was interested in what 
the intrinsic constraints.

804
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:04,341
We're on a social contract and he said,
and he was trying to address this issue 

805
00:46:04,341 --> 00:46:08,220
of the insufficiency of want as a,
as a,

806
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:13,460
as a,
as a tool to justify your claims to 

807
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,551
truth.
And that's when he introduced the idea 

808
00:46:16,551 --> 00:46:17,070
of the equilibrated state.
So if you're sophisticated,

809
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:22,670
you have to put forward your want and 
then need it in a way that will meet it 

810
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:29,280
today and tomorrow and next month and 
next year and in a decade.

811
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:34,550
So you have to iterate yourself across 
time and you have to take all of the 

812
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:40,070
iterations of yourself across time with 
some degree of seriousness and then you 

813
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:44,871
also have to do the same thing as you 
extend yourself out into the social 

814
00:46:44,871 --> 00:46:47,961
community.
So it has to be what's good for me now 

815
00:46:47,961 --> 00:46:51,650
and repetitively into the future in a 
manner that simultaneously good for you 

816
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:55,530
now and simultaneously into the future.
And that starts to become an.

817
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,700
And he thought about that as the 
playable game,

818
00:46:57,701 --> 00:47:00,030
something like that.
The voluntarily playable game.

819
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:05,540
And there's something deep about that 
because it includes the idea of 

820
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:05,540
iteration,
you know,

821
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:06,960
iterated interpretations into the 
equation,

822
00:47:06,961 --> 00:47:09,450
which strikes me as like,
of crucial importance.

823
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:11,660
Okay.
Yeah.

824
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:17,950
Again,
I think by my count about six very 

825
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:20,611
interesting subtopics built into that 
and the latter part of a very nice 

826
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:26,730
statement I think of kind of lightened 
meant humanism where we're going to take

827
00:47:26,831 --> 00:47:31,831
power seriously,
but we're going a constraint power in a 

828
00:47:31,831 --> 00:47:36,091
way that respects the individual and 
simultaneously enables individuals to 

829
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,760
form mutually beneficial social network 
across time.

830
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,570
And so,
uh,

831
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:45,980
and uh,
I'm very sympathetic to a,

832
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,680
that overall right construction,
uh,

833
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:51,940
that comes out of them.
The first part,

834
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:53,440
which is a taxonomy,
right?

835
00:47:53,441 --> 00:47:58,441
That you're offering about the nature of
power and that taxonomy does differ 

836
00:47:58,451 --> 00:48:03,451
significantly from both the Marxist and,
and the Nietzschean one I would say is,

837
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
you know,
I think it's better to take power right 

838
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,860
more neutrally.
Um,

839
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,750
so there's a continuity with what the 
physicists do.

840
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,820
My understanding there is a power or 
just the,

841
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:20,740
the ability to get work done.
So it's a,

842
00:48:20,741 --> 00:48:24,640
it's a tool and functionality,
right?

843
00:48:24,641 --> 00:48:29,641
Language,
right power is what gets you from a to 

844
00:48:29,641 --> 00:48:29,641
B.
Great.

845
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:36,210
I love that description because it fits 
very nicely in with the narrative 

846
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:40,440
conceptualization of b,
because narratives seem to be 

847
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,620
descriptions of something like how to 
get from point a to point B,

848
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:46,870
right?
But it also doesn't say anything about 

849
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:49,900
being in the status of be how we choose 
where we should be going,

850
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,760
but what our ends are or what are our 
goals are going.

851
00:48:52,761 --> 00:48:56,690
So in that sense,
power is normatively neutral.

852
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:59,460
It's a means to an end.
Uh,

853
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:04,460
and that means that when we start to try
to evaluate the uses of power,

854
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:09,970
we're going to be evaluating power in 
terms of the ends towards which is put 

855
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,420
a,
if I can end with that pip position.

856
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:17,480
Yeah.
So now then we say,

857
00:49:17,481 --> 00:49:22,481
okay,
well power comes in all kinds of 

858
00:49:22,481 --> 00:49:22,481
hormones,
right?

859
00:49:22,481 --> 00:49:24,710
We're quite happy to say those 
intellectual power or the ability to use

860
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:29,711
our minds to,
to address and solve certain problems 

861
00:49:29,711 --> 00:49:32,630
that there's muscular power will the 
ability to move physical objects.

862
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,620
There's a social power people respect 
you and are,

863
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:41,790
are willing to spend time with you and 
divert resources to voluntarily and so 

864
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:42,890
forth.
Uh,

865
00:49:42,891 --> 00:49:44,600
there's military power,
political power,

866
00:49:44,601 --> 00:49:48,080
and so we're going to have a whole set 
of subspecies of power.

867
00:49:48,081 --> 00:49:51,890
And what they all have in common is a,
in each of those domains,

868
00:49:51,891 --> 00:49:56,891
there are goals and having the power 
enables you to achieve your goals in 

869
00:49:56,891 --> 00:49:57,440
those domains.

870
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:02,720
Great.
And we shouldn't fall prey to the 

871
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:02,720
illusion that there's necessarily any,
like,

872
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,610
what would you call it,
unifying matrix that makes all those 

873
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:08,100
different forms of power.
Importantly,

874
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:11,100
similar except for the terminology you 
know,

875
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:16,480
we,
and this is another thing that bothers 

876
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,860
me about the both,
the Nietzschean in the Marxist Marxist 

877
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:21,801
view,
is that there's this proclivity to 

878
00:50:21,801 --> 00:50:24,141
collapse these multiple modes of power 
into power itself and that's not 

879
00:50:24,141 --> 00:50:28,971
reasonable because if it's reasonable to
note many of the forms of power that you

880
00:50:29,061 --> 00:50:34,061
just described contend against one 
another rather than mutually fortifying 

881
00:50:34,061 --> 00:50:34,660
one another.
It's like a.

882
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,450
it's like the balance of power in a.
In a polity like the American polity,

883
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:42,080
that's a deep point that you're making 
a,

884
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:47,090
I think both the Marxists and the 
Nietzschean to do ended up collapsing 

885
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:50,340
power into a unitary type.
Alright,

886
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:55,390
that's when the steak,
but it's a mistake only if you deny 

887
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:58,310
right?
As both the marshals and the Nietzschean

888
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:03,360
do that.
There is a deep individuality right 

889
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,290
about a world.
So if you think by contrast,

890
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:10,320
right about the kind of individual human
rights respecting and lightening and 

891
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:13,660
vision,
you're articulating that I agree with as

892
00:51:13,661 --> 00:51:16,780
well.
For normatively,

893
00:51:16,781 --> 00:51:21,781
that wants to devolve social power to 
the individual or individuals with a 

894
00:51:22,931 --> 00:51:27,931
great deal of self responsibility and 
control over their own domain.

895
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:33,450
Right?
So the speed and the idea then is that 

896
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:35,911
if we're going to form social 
relationships or any sort of social 

897
00:51:35,911 --> 00:51:39,931
interaction,
it has to be mutually respecting that I 

898
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:43,981
have to respect your control over your 
domain and you respect my control over 

899
00:51:43,981 --> 00:51:47,020
my domain,
but we agreed to share domains,

900
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,460
so to speak,
that voluntary.

901
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:49,690
Right?

902
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:56,270
And this is a place where I think the 
post modernists are really open to you 

903
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:59,770
might say conceptual assault is that you
know,

904
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,670
in order to have that freedom devolve 
upon the individual in that manner,

905
00:52:04,671 --> 00:52:09,671
it also means that the individual has to
take responsibility for acting as a 

906
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:14,261
locus of power in world actual 
responsibility and cannot conceive of 

907
00:52:14,261 --> 00:52:19,121
themselves or act in a manner that only 
makes them an Avatar of a social 

908
00:52:19,121 --> 00:52:22,631
movement.
And I think that art of the preferred 

909
00:52:22,631 --> 00:52:26,040
anthony individualism of the radical 
left is precisely predicated on that 

910
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,810
refusal to take responsibility.
And I think that's also reflected in the

911
00:52:29,811 --> 00:52:32,990
fact that by temperament,
they're low in trait conscientiousness,

912
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,900
so it's deep,
it's not merely an opinion,

913
00:52:35,901 --> 00:52:38,420
it's an expression of something that's 
even deeper than opinion

914
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:41,320
prayed.
Locus of responsibility,

915
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:43,880
locus of power,
locus of control.

916
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:49,540
You're right that the far left in 
Marxist in Neo Marxists form does deny 

917
00:52:50,361 --> 00:52:55,361
that.
But you also find that in far right in 

918
00:52:56,091 --> 00:52:56,990
general,
right?

919
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,910
So this is a bit of cartoon,
right?

920
00:52:58,911 --> 00:53:00,570
To intellectual history,
right?

921
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:03,860
But then if you try to trace it to the 
Marxist on the left and the nutrients on

922
00:53:03,861 --> 00:53:08,861
the right,
both of them do denied that individuals 

923
00:53:08,861 --> 00:53:12,311
are locus Loci,
rather have responsibility by both of 

924
00:53:12,311 --> 00:53:15,731
them in their views of human nature have
strongly deterministic views for what we

925
00:53:16,461 --> 00:53:17,870
call an individual.
Right?

926
00:53:17,871 --> 00:53:19,710
According to both of them,
right?

927
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,760
It's just a vehicle through which right 
outside forces are flowing,

928
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,040
so to speak.

929
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:27,210
Right?
Well,

930
00:53:27,211 --> 00:53:32,211
you can also see that in some sense,
as a perverse consequence of the 

931
00:53:32,211 --> 00:53:34,950
scientific revolution because you're 
still see this among modern scientists.

932
00:53:34,951 --> 00:53:35,550
It's like,
okay,

933
00:53:35,551 --> 00:53:38,220
what are the causal forces that regulate
human behavior?

934
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:40,350
Okay,
there's two primary sources,

935
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:42,850
mature slash biology and culture.

936
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:47,420
So it's the crude nature versus nurture,
debate being played out through them.

937
00:53:47,421 --> 00:53:47,930
Yes.

938
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:49,320
Right.
So,

939
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:54,340
and that's in my opinion,
and I've derived this conclusion from 

940
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:59,241
studying mythology mostly,
is that there's a missing third element 

941
00:53:59,241 --> 00:53:59,970
there,
which is whatever the active force,

942
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:05,030
whatever it is that constitutes the 
active force of individual 

943
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:05,030
consciousness,

944
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:08,940
right?
We don't have a good grounds right in 

945
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:13,740
being an independent private initiator 
of power instead of merely a responder 

946
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,610
to other power forces,
right?

947
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:20,240
Or a vehicle through which those other 
power forces operate.

948
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,600
So yeah,
the individualism,

949
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,190
right?
Uh,

950
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:26,530
that is built into enlightenment 
humanism.

951
00:54:26,531 --> 00:54:31,531
We start to see it developing in 
renaissance humanism is to take 

952
00:54:31,531 --> 00:54:31,531
seriously,
right?

953
00:54:31,531 --> 00:54:34,510
The notion that individuals have some 
measure,

954
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:37,870
some significant measure of control over
their Fox,

955
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,310
over the actions,
the shape,

956
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,660
the shape,
their own destiny,

957
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:47,170
and that is fundamental right to one 
moral dignity as a human being.

958
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:52,710
And so that is going to be a live view 
of human nature built into the ethics 

959
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:59,520
fundamentally.
And then all of social relationships 

960
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,060
have to be respectful of that 
individuality.

961
00:55:01,061 --> 00:55:06,061
And then consequently,
when we start to turn to political 

962
00:55:06,061 --> 00:55:06,400
theory,
or we thought knockabout very heavy duty

963
00:55:06,401 --> 00:55:10,270
use of power such as the police and the 
military,

964
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:13,600
uh,
we want to have a serious constraints on

965
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:18,630
government power to make sure that we 
are respecting the individual 

966
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:18,820
sovereignty.

967
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,450
Okay.
So here's something perverse to that,

968
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,480
that,
that emerges as a consequence of 

969
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:27,600
something you pointed out earlier in the
conversation.

970
00:55:27,601 --> 00:55:30,980
You know,
you mentioned that when modernism emerge

971
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:36,110
out of medieval Islam,
the two things happened and one was the 

972
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:39,351
elaboration of the conceptual frames 
that enabled us to deal with the 

973
00:55:39,351 --> 00:55:42,471
external world,
but the other was the elevation of the 

974
00:55:42,471 --> 00:55:45,561
individual to the status of valid critic
predicated on the idea that there was 

975
00:55:45,561 --> 00:55:48,450
something actually valid about 
individual experience as such.

976
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:51,090
Now the problem there as far as I can 
tell,

977
00:55:51,091 --> 00:55:53,340
and maybe this is part of the reason 
we're in this conundrum,

978
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:58,341
is that the,
the elaboration of the objective 

979
00:55:58,341 --> 00:56:02,301
scientific viewpoint let us left us with
the idea that it was either nature or 

980
00:56:02,551 --> 00:56:05,850
nurture that was the source of human 
motive power.

981
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,700
But the missing element there is.
Well,

982
00:56:08,701 --> 00:56:13,701
if that's the case,
then why grant to the individual to 

983
00:56:13,701 --> 00:56:14,670
begin with the role of independent 
social critic?

984
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:17,130
Like on what grounds do you,
and it's like the,

985
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:20,850
it's like the resentment.
It's like a residual belief in something

986
00:56:20,851 --> 00:56:25,851
like the autonomy of the soul.
You can't just sneak in and not justify 

987
00:56:25,851 --> 00:56:26,080
without,
without,

988
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,660
without problems like the ones that we 
have now.

989
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:35,200
That's well put and I think it's fair to
say that we still are in the infancy of 

990
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,830
the psychological sciences.
You can speak to this better than I can,

991
00:56:38,831 --> 00:56:43,831
but as someone in philosophy,
I think we're still at the beginnings 

992
00:56:43,831 --> 00:56:48,060
and we are still in the grip of early 
and crude versions,

993
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:52,290
crude scientific understandings of how 
cause and effect operators.

994
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:55,420
And so what we are starting with is very
mechanical,

995
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:57,580
uh,
understandings.

996
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:01,420
And we can understand how people that 
are pushed around by biological forces.

997
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:04,480
We can understand to some extent now the
push around by the external,

998
00:57:04,481 --> 00:57:09,481
physical and mechanical forces,
but we do not yet have a sophisticated 

999
00:57:09,481 --> 00:57:11,260
enough understanding of the human brain,
the human mind,

1000
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:16,261
human psychology.
To understand how a volitional 

1001
00:57:16,261 --> 00:57:20,401
consciousness can be a causal force 
causal power in the world.

1002
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:22,280
Right?
So that's perfectly put.

1003
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:27,320
So in this,
I do a detailed analysis that some of 

1004
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,480
the people who watch,
we're familiar with this movie Pinocchio

1005
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,480
and Un Occhio is got a very classic 
mythological structure and it basically 

1006
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,201
introduces three elements of va,
so there's the element of being that's 

1007
00:57:39,201 --> 00:57:43,550
associated with Japan and also the evil 
tyrannical forces that are kind of 

1008
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:46,290
patriarchal in nature and that's sort of
the conceptualization of society.

1009
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:49,580
I've been evolent element and a level at
the elements.

1010
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:53,530
And then there's the introduction of 
this other causal factor in it.

1011
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:58,900
It's personified in the form of the blue
fairy in the blue fairy is a 

1012
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,840
manifestation of mother nature and she 
animates the Nokia,

1013
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:05,580
so Japan creates them and then sets up a
wish for his independence.

1014
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:10,170
And then nature appears in the guise of 
the blue fairy and and grants that wish.

1015
00:58:10,171 --> 00:58:13,680
So you have culture and nature 
conspiring to produce.

1016
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:18,180
I'm a puppet that could in fact 
disentangle itself from its strength,

1017
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:23,540
but the movie insists and it does this 
on profound mythological grounds that 

1018
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:26,520
the puppet itself has a causal role to 
play in it's own,

1019
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:31,870
um,
what would you call its own capacity to 

1020
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:31,870
transcend the deterministic change that 
it's being,

1021
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:37,230
that,
that have the deterministic processes 

1022
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:38,250
that have given rise to it,
but that also enslaved it and you know,

1023
00:58:38,251 --> 00:58:38,670
in,
in,

1024
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,610
in all of our profound narratives,
I would say,

1025
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:47,030
and this is part of the way that they 
differ from the standard scientific 

1026
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:47,030
account.
There's always that third element.

1027
00:58:47,030 --> 00:58:50,580
There's always the autonomous individual
who is in some sense,

1028
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,730
you know,
lifting himself up by his own bootstraps

1029
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:59,120
and,
and I don't think it's a problem that 

1030
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,521
science is unable to account for that,
but it's a very big problem with 

1031
00:59:01,521 --> 00:59:06,351
scientists who are unable to account for
that deny that it exists because they 

1032
00:59:06,351 --> 00:59:09,150
can't explain it then becomes 
extraordinarily dangerous,

1033
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:09,860
right?

1034
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:13,820
Once you stop looking,
uh,

1035
00:59:13,821 --> 00:59:14,740
you stopped crying,
right?

1036
00:59:14,741 --> 00:59:17,570
Then you're left with a,
an impoverished account.

1037
00:59:17,571 --> 00:59:20,710
So in a way,
there's a kind of Hubris right?

1038
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:22,620
Built into the skepticism,
right?

1039
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:23,640
It says,
you know,

1040
00:59:23,641 --> 00:59:26,480
I know that this is a problem that we 
just can't solve that,

1041
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:29,010
and so I'm not going to try.
I'll try anymore.

1042
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:35,140
There's A.
There's a performative contradiction as 

1043
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:35,320
well,
which is much worth pointing out because

1044
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:41,040
on the one hand,
the scientists might well claim as far 

1045
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,330
as I'm concerned from an epistomological
person perspective,

1046
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,940
the only two causal forces are nature 
and culture,

1047
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:51,510
but then I'll go about my actions in the
normal world as an existential being,

1048
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:56,910
acting in the world,
and I will swallow whole heartedly the 

1049
00:59:56,910 --> 01:00:00,451
proposition that each individual is 
responsible for his own actions because 

1050
01:00:00,451 --> 01:00:04,381
that's how I constantly interact with 
everyone in the world and I get very 

1051
01:00:04,381 --> 01:00:04,810
irritated if they violate that 
principle.

1052
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:08,640
Right?
So how you live,

1053
01:00:08,641 --> 01:00:13,641
so to speak with your skepticism or with
your relativism in a way that doesn't 

1054
01:00:13,641 --> 01:00:14,760
mean snarl you in the countries and 
contradictions.

1055
01:00:14,761 --> 01:00:16,740
That's a.
that's a hard contract itself.

1056
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:22,720
It does.
It does seem to be that I think it's 

1057
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,851
reasonable to point out that it's not 
possible to find a person who acts as if

1058
01:00:26,881 --> 01:00:30,330
he or anyone else is biologically are 
culturally determined.

1059
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,270
We just don't behave that way in the 
real world.

1060
01:00:33,271 --> 01:00:38,271
We act as if we're responsible for our 
own actions and the consequences of 

1061
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:38,271
those actions.

1062
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:41,760
So then we have a tension between what 
our intellectual theories,

1063
01:00:41,761 --> 01:00:45,960
right are telling us and what are kind 
of empirical data,

1064
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:51,080
right was telling them.
So we don't yet have a way to put those 

1065
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,320
two together.
And then what you as an individual do in

1066
01:00:52,321 --> 01:00:55,170
response to that tension between theory 
and practice.

1067
01:00:55,410 --> 01:01:00,410
Uh,
that's a whole other can of things to 

1068
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:00,410
explore.
Great.

1069
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:03,210
To get the backup to our discussion 
about power.

1070
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:08,360
Um,
it's interesting that the way our 

1071
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,450
discussion right up to that point then 
integrates,

1072
01:01:09,451 --> 01:01:11,940
right free thing.
So we started talking about proof,

1073
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:18,080
uh,
and then we started talking about goals 

1074
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,500
and normative ends,
right in ideals.

1075
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:25,280
And then we talk about power.
So there was already the big three 

1076
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,570
truth,
a ideals,

1077
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:31,230
right and power.
I discussion about truth right?

1078
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:34,770
Took us into a logical issues,
right in philosophy,

1079
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:39,900
our discussion about ideals that takes 
us into ethics and ethics issues.

1080
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:44,940
Again,
also in philosophy or discussion of 

1081
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:44,940
power,
right?

1082
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:46,530
Takes us in to issues about human 
nature,

1083
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:49,850
which traditionally,
but a branch of philosophy now,

1084
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,920
smarter sub disciplines were doing so we
already have to have a theory of 

1085
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,610
epistemology,
theory of human nature,

1086
01:01:56,820 --> 01:02:01,820
a theory of efforts,
and we sometimes try to integrate those 

1087
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:04,650
and postmodernism is going to be an 
integration,

1088
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:09,690
right,
of certain views that develop in 

1089
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:13,140
divisions in all three of those areas.
So maybe one way to put it is this,

1090
01:02:13,141 --> 01:02:18,141
if you,
if you contrast it to again taking white

1091
01:02:19,431 --> 01:02:24,431
moment as our touchstone a since we're 
both fans of the enlightenment because 

1092
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:28,650
they were fine with,
with power,

1093
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:33,390
like knowledge is power and we want to 
empower the individual,

1094
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:38,440
right?
We want to eliminate slavery and 

1095
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,791
empower.
People want to eliminate or fashion 

1096
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:42,660
sexism and empower women.
So power.

1097
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:45,980
Yeah.
We actually want to remove arbitrary and

1098
01:02:45,981 --> 01:02:48,370
unnecessary impediments to the 
expression.

1099
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,320
Yeah.
Proper power.

1100
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:54,580
That's so there are legitimate uses of 
power that are stopping and disempower 

1101
01:02:56,141 --> 01:02:58,650
and right people.
So it's the double edge sword,

1102
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:04,390
uh,
and as long as power is properly 

1103
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:06,501
directed or properly located,
right then we are confident that by and 

1104
01:03:06,501 --> 01:03:11,271
large people individually and socially 
we'll use their power to put together 

1105
01:03:11,311 --> 01:03:16,311
useful lives,
build a successful economies and 

1106
01:03:16,311 --> 01:03:20,271
societies and so forth.
So it was actually a very optimistic 

1107
01:03:20,271 --> 01:03:21,470
right overall assessment about,
uh,

1108
01:03:21,471 --> 01:03:22,770
about,
about power,

1109
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:27,870
but power right is then structured as a 
means to an end.

1110
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:33,410
And we want to empower people 
cognitively teach them how to read,

1111
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,630
teach them how to think,
right,

1112
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:40,230
so that they themselves can understand 
the truth and discover new truth.

1113
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:45,410
But so power leads to true,
but we also then want people to be free 

1114
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:49,110
to,
uh,

1115
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:49,920
to,
uh,

1116
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:50,620
to,
uh,

1117
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,650
to act on the basis of their,
their power.

1118
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:57,900
Because then we think that if people are
respected as individual agents are going

1119
01:03:57,901 --> 01:04:00,270
to be happier,
uh,

1120
01:04:00,271 --> 01:04:03,760
and so they will achieve good goals and 
they will mute workout,

1121
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:05,660
share together,
fair will,

1122
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:07,860
uh,
agreements and deals,

1123
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:13,020
a kind of justice will,
the society will get better and better 

1124
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:16,870
and so forth.
So power is in the service of just 

1125
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:19,780
social relations.
And powers in the service of truth.

1126
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:23,700
Great.
That's a great,

1127
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:29,070
that's a great justification for the 
enlightenment viewpoint.

1128
01:04:29,071 --> 01:04:34,071
And it seems,
I don't want to stop you from pursuing 

1129
01:04:34,071 --> 01:04:36,831
that,
but it also seems to me that to the 

1130
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:39,870
degree that that's true,
a valid description of the enlightenment

1131
01:04:39,871 --> 01:04:44,871
aims and to the degree that that's 
actually manifested itself in reality in

1132
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:47,190
the state,
in the current state of human affairs,

1133
01:04:47,191 --> 01:04:52,191
that it's perhaps unwise of us to allow 
our Marxist or are Nietzschean 

1134
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,720
presuppositions to take,
uh,

1135
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,460
take two careless to swing at that 
foundation.

1136
01:04:59,461 --> 01:05:00,530
Given that it's actually okay.

1137
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:06,610
Absolutely right.
And that's why the enlightenment 

1138
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:08,700
articulation power is good.
If it's in the service of proof,

1139
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,800
right?
Or power is good.

1140
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:15,830
If it's in the service of justice and 
you were fine and we're optimistic 

1141
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:18,580
enough about human beings cognitively 
and morally,

1142
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:23,380
that we think empowering them,
giving them lots of freedoms is going to

1143
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:28,440
increase the net stocker approved and 
it's going to increase the net stocker 

1144
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:32,190
justice.
So that entire enlightenment package is 

1145
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:35,461
precisely what the counter enlightenment
attacks and attack very fundamentally.

1146
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:41,700
So that by the time we get to two,
three generations later to the 

1147
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:44,050
generations of marks and eat you,
it has been hollowed out.

1148
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:46,750
So on the epistomological side,
right?

1149
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,160
We don't believe,
right,

1150
01:05:48,290 --> 01:05:50,820
that there is such a thing as true 
anymore.

1151
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:56,850
So it's not the case that power is in 
the search for truth because we don't 

1152
01:05:56,850 --> 01:06:00,901
believe that human beings are capable of
getting any sort of objective proof 

1153
01:06:00,901 --> 01:06:02,590
anymore.
So we're just left with power.

1154
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:08,250
And also on the normative side,
we don't believe in dressed us right 

1155
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:12,210
anymore.
We don't believe that any sort of 

1156
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:14,290
normative principles or ethical ideals 
can be objective.

1157
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:17,380
We ground up.
And so then once again,

1158
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:19,370
maybe we're left with subjective 
designers,

1159
01:06:19,371 --> 01:06:20,320
right?
And so forth.

1160
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,990
But we're just left again with power.
So Howard,

1161
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:26,830
service approved power in the service of
justice that goes away.

1162
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:29,940
All we are left with is power.
Sure.

1163
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:35,770
Well we could mount a psychoanalytic 
critique of that set of objections 

1164
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:38,470
because I could say,
okay,

1165
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:41,110
here's some reasons.
Let's,

1166
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,780
let's assume that you're doing something
simple

1167
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,860
and and

1168
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:52,150
let's assume you're doing something 
simple and easy instead of complicated 

1169
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:56,111
and difficult with your objections,
and so here's the simple and easy 

1170
01:06:56,111 --> 01:06:59,681
explanation you want to dispense with 
the idea of justice and truth because 

1171
01:07:00,471 --> 01:07:05,471
that lightens your existential lobe 
because now there's nothing difficult 

1172
01:07:05,471 --> 01:07:08,921
and noble that you have to strive for 
and you want to reduce everything to 

1173
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:12,200
power because that justifies your use of
power in the pursuit of your immediate,

1174
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:18,220
in pursuit of those immediate goals that
you no longer even have to justify it 

1175
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:21,881
because you don't have to make reference
to any higher standards of justice or 

1176
01:07:21,881 --> 01:07:26,081
true,
and so I would say that's a deep 

1177
01:07:26,081 --> 01:07:30,730
impulsive and resentful nihilism that's 
manifesting itself as a glorious 

1178
01:07:31,341 --> 01:07:35,750
intellectual critique.
Now I'm understanding as well that there

1179
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:40,370
is the history of genuine intellectual 
critique that you'd be laying out,

1180
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:45,430
which is not trivial,
but those things have to be 

1181
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:45,430
differentiated.
You know,

1182
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:48,800
it's certainly not reasonable either.
For those who claim that all there is is

1183
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:53,830
power,
that they're not themselves motivated 

1184
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:53,830
equally by that power.

1185
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:55,700
So in one way,
right?

1186
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:59,430
What you could always say in the tech 
philosophy is autobiographical,

1187
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:04,520
in many cases were philosophers will put
their pronouncements in bird person 

1188
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:05,630
form.
I don't generalize form,

1189
01:08:05,631 --> 01:08:10,631
but if you always put it down to the 
power or sort of person formulations 

1190
01:08:10,821 --> 01:08:13,280
that can be profoundly self regulatory,
right?

1191
01:08:13,281 --> 01:08:17,570
So if you say for example,
human beings are Scamo,

1192
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:22,660
where then you have some sort of 
pessimistic already assessment of the 

1193
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:23,480
human condition,
a well built into that.

1194
01:08:23,481 --> 01:08:26,720
Then as the idea that I think if I 
personally I am scum,

1195
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:28,970
we're really doing is a,
is a,

1196
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:34,580
is a first person confession and it's 
always done in a legitimate move to 

1197
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:36,960
exempt yourself from the,
from the general principle,

1198
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:41,500
right?
Everything just is to come back.

1199
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:45,770
You are more likely topic,
your power relations and people imposing

1200
01:08:45,771 --> 01:08:48,890
their agendas on other people than what 
you're saying is,

1201
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:52,160
well,
my fundamental commitment is power and I

1202
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:54,680
just want to impose my agenda on other 
people.

1203
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:57,830
So I think you're right that it can go 
both ways.

1204
01:08:57,831 --> 01:09:00,530
It can of course be that you have people
who,

1205
01:09:00,531 --> 01:09:05,240
for whatever reason,
have a predisposition to nihilistic,

1206
01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:09,440
uh,
a more power seating and they,

1207
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:11,900
when they become adults and 
intellectual,

1208
01:09:11,901 --> 01:09:14,660
they latch onto theories,
uh,

1209
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:19,430
that in indulgent that enabled them to 
rationalize their predispositions.

1210
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:25,050
Uh,
and so in many cases you are a lot of 

1211
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:26,390
postmodernism in some of the 
manifestations is disingenuous,

1212
01:09:26,391 --> 01:09:31,391
right in that form that people don't 
necessarily buy into the postmodern 

1213
01:09:31,611 --> 01:09:36,140
philosophical framework,
but rather in kind of pragmatic form,

1214
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:42,160
postmodernism as a set of tools is 
useful for them to advance their own 

1215
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:47,891
personal and social agenda.
But whatever those happen to be because 

1216
01:09:47,891 --> 01:09:47,891
they find it.

1217
01:09:47,891 --> 01:09:49,160
Okay.
So let's switch a little bit.

1218
01:09:49,610 --> 01:09:51,320
Let's switch over into that a little 
bit.

1219
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:54,980
And I found our discussion for what it's
worth,

1220
01:09:54,981 --> 01:09:58,580
I found her discussion extremely useful 
on the philosophical and,

1221
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:01,220
but now I would like to make it a bit 
more personal.

1222
01:10:01,221 --> 01:10:02,600
So now you,
if you don't mind,

1223
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:07,630
you've written this book and it's a 
fairly punchy but say critique of 

1224
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:13,600
postmodernism and its alliance with neo 
Marxism and,

1225
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:18,500
and you've done a careful job of laying 
out the historical development of that,

1226
01:10:19,150 --> 01:10:21,230
have both of those movements and their 
alliance.

1227
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:22,980
Um,
what,

1228
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:27,620
what was your motivation for doing that 
and what do you,

1229
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:32,450
what have you experienced one as a 
consequence of writing the book and to,

1230
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:36,980
as a consequence of a professor who's in
the midst of a,

1231
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:41,660
of an academic society that's basically 
running on postmodern principles?

1232
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,680
Yeah,
that's a good trio of questions there.

1233
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:50,070
But my,
my motivation for writing the book was a

1234
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:54,410
motivations plural.
A one is an intellectual exercise.

1235
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:59,500
A year was a movement that was complex.
Many philosophical and cultural screens 

1236
01:11:01,511 --> 01:11:06,511
were coming together and uh,
I enjoy the intellectual history very 

1237
01:11:06,511 --> 01:11:09,200
much so.
It was a pleasure for me to,

1238
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:14,650
to read back into the histories and the 
cheese out over the lines of and how 

1239
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:15,540
things were packaged,
be packaged.

1240
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:21,340
Uh,
so that the postmodern synthesis right 

1241
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:23,430
as it came together in the front of the 
second,

1242
01:11:23,431 --> 01:11:24,840
third and 20th century,
right,

1243
01:11:24,841 --> 01:11:28,060
came,
came into being as a,

1244
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:31,170
as a purely intellectual historical 
enterprise,

1245
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:36,260
found that fulfilling a partly also this
was a 19,

1246
01:11:36,691 --> 01:11:38,760
90,
late 19 nineties.

1247
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:41,280
It's end of the Cold War.
Uh,

1248
01:11:41,281 --> 01:11:46,281
one of the things I had done,
not professionally but just out of 

1249
01:11:46,281 --> 01:11:48,990
personal interest was read a lot of 
political philosophy,

1250
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,960
read a lot about the Cold War and the,
uh,

1251
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:56,050
the intellectual developments and 
political developments that have gone on

1252
01:11:56,051 --> 01:11:56,160
there.

1253
01:11:56,160 --> 01:12:01,160
So I had a very good say amateur working
knowledge before I started researching 

1254
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:06,291
the book about the history of Marxism 
and history of the Cold War geopolitics 

1255
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:13,670
and sort of one of the big questions 
that are on everyone's mind person in 

1256
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:14,190
the 19 nineties with the fall of the 
Soviet Union.

1257
01:12:14,191 --> 01:12:17,880
The end of the Cold War is what's going 
to happen next,

1258
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:21,150
whether it's the new geo political 
alignment going to be.

1259
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:24,640
But then from my academic position,
uh,

1260
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:29,700
the big question inside the intellectual
world is since far left politics had 

1261
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:36,440
been so prominent and that for 
generations,

1262
01:12:37,201 --> 01:12:42,201
right?
Intellectuals inside the academic world 

1263
01:12:42,201 --> 01:12:43,290
at large will given the benefit of the 
doubt too far,

1264
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:48,291
leftists experiments,
even going out of the way to be fellow 

1265
01:12:48,291 --> 01:12:50,670
travelers and so forth that,
uh,

1266
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:52,830
by the time you get to the end of the 
cold war,

1267
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:57,831
basically everybody except for a few 
true believers is rethinking.

1268
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:03,920
Right?
So what does this mean for not 

1269
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,700
necessarily left politics more broadly,
but certainly for our lab by politics.

1270
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:12,710
Uh,
and so even the far right of the 

1271
01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:15,831
leftists are recognizing that they're 
going to have to come up with some sort 

1272
01:13:15,831 --> 01:13:19,311
of a new strategy in order to remain 
intellectually respectable and some sort

1273
01:13:20,371 --> 01:13:25,371
of a new strategy in order to become a 
culturally and politically feasible.

1274
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:31,580
So I didn't have a kind of a cultural,
political interest in what the thinking 

1275
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:37,221
was on the far left about what they're 
going to do now that the Soviet Union 

1276
01:13:38,461 --> 01:13:43,461
has collapsed and the whole world is 
shifting more toward market liberalism 

1277
01:13:43,771 --> 01:13:48,771
or to some sort of third way central is 
loaded up on the beach.

1278
01:13:49,561 --> 01:13:54,561
So yes.
So you have a huge amount of empirical 

1279
01:13:54,561 --> 01:13:58,030
data that you have to confront and uh,
uh,

1280
01:13:58,190 --> 01:14:03,190
yeah,
I think this is certainly going to be 

1281
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:04,521
part of the postmodern package,
but there was a lot of denial of the 

1282
01:14:04,521 --> 01:14:07,190
relevance of Empiricism,
a lot of denial of the,

1283
01:14:07,191 --> 01:14:12,191
uh,
the relevance of logic and social 

1284
01:14:12,191 --> 01:14:14,721
scientific statistical methods of 
aggregating that data and which normally

1285
01:14:14,861 --> 01:14:19,861
the conclusions on the basis of that.
So we can understand the temptation on 

1286
01:14:19,861 --> 01:14:24,181
the part of a lot of people to find 
psychological devices that will enable 

1287
01:14:24,881 --> 01:14:28,810
them to deny the gulag and various other
things

1288
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:35,040
either are stacked viciously and get the
facts as even you would constrain them.

1289
01:14:38,131 --> 01:14:41,910
Are Stacking officiously in 
contradiction to your theory.

1290
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:45,920
It's time to mount an all out assault on
what constitutes a fact.

1291
01:14:47,090 --> 01:14:47,870
One strategy,

1292
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:49,940
and that's again,
one of the sub strategies,

1293
01:14:49,941 --> 01:14:52,610
I think that postmodern postmodern 
worldview,

1294
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:57,840
so if you then have a loss suffers and 
social scientists and the people who are

1295
01:14:57,981 --> 01:15:02,960
up to speed in their epistemology who 
are telling you well know there are just

1296
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:08,030
know different narratives that are out 
there and there are no such things as 

1297
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:11,240
objective facts and logic was not 
necessarily pointing in one direction.

1298
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,360
There are poly logics or,
or,

1299
01:15:13,361 --> 01:15:15,610
or multiple frameworks.
Then,

1300
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,840
uh,
if you have one framework that says no,

1301
01:15:17,841 --> 01:15:19,830
there are objective facts,
uh,

1302
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,810
and,
and the logic is all going against your,

1303
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:27,830
your version of political idealism.
It's to be very tempting for you to say,

1304
01:15:27,921 --> 01:15:32,921
well,
I can just dismiss that as just one 

1305
01:15:32,921 --> 01:15:33,350
narrative way of constructing the 
historical facts.

1306
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:37,610
I can come up with a different narrative
that softens organized like all together

1307
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:41,880
and certainly some of the bad faith 
postmodernist who go down that road like

1308
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:43,790
very much so.

1309
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:48,200
In part that was my motivation for 
writing the book part.

1310
01:15:48,201 --> 01:15:53,201
I did feel that I was in a good position
intellectually to do so because my,

1311
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,670
my phd work had been in,
in logic,

1312
01:15:58,671 --> 01:16:03,671
philosophy of science systemology,
so it was up to speed on the entire 

1313
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:08,740
history of a log from the modern world 
on blue things are the way things were 

1314
01:16:09,891 --> 01:16:14,891
in the eighties and early nineties.
So I was reading the same people that 

1315
01:16:15,141 --> 01:16:20,141
were already had,
I have to say I've learned an enormous 

1316
01:16:20,141 --> 01:16:22,781
amount from reading Richard Rorty.
He's first rate even though I ended up 

1317
01:16:22,781 --> 01:16:26,140
disagreeing fundamentally everything,
uh,

1318
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:31,370
who goes phd also was in philosophy.
He also a phd in psychology.

1319
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:35,170
There's another philosophy,
Phd Realtor,

1320
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:40,190
another philosophy phd,
so not necessarily put myself on the 

1321
01:16:40,190 --> 01:16:42,350
same stature right intellectually,
but,

1322
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:47,740
uh,
all of the so to speak or first grade 

1323
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:47,740
educated,
any piss demolished,

1324
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:52,540
so I know where they're coming from and 
where all of that is going at the same 

1325
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:52,730
time.

1326
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:53,780
Uh,
my,

1327
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:58,800
uh,
my undergraduate and master's degree at 

1328
01:16:58,800 --> 01:16:59,180
Grove,
just down the road from you,

1329
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:00,730
uh,
in a,

1330
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:05,760
in history of philosophy.
So a long standing passion for how 

1331
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,300
arguments and movements develop over 
time.

1332
01:17:08,910 --> 01:17:09,800
Uh,
so,

1333
01:17:09,801 --> 01:17:10,730
uh,
I thought I had,

1334
01:17:10,731 --> 01:17:15,731
it was in a good position to see how 
postmodernism have evolved out of 

1335
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:20,120
various other earlier movements that had
developed over time and I am enough of a

1336
01:17:20,121 --> 01:17:25,121
political animal to be interested in 
political philosophy and I believe that 

1337
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,050
abstract philosophical theory when it 
puts it,

1338
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:33,070
gets put into practice,
make life and death practical 

1339
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:33,410
differences.
So the stakes are high.

1340
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:38,800
Uh,
so it was motivated then to put it all 

1341
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,281
together.
How does the history and the philosophy 

1342
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:42,050
and the politics all come together in.
And so,

1343
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:47,610
so I wrote the book now a yeah.
How it has affected me personally in an 

1344
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:50,090
academic life.

1345
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:51,420
Well,
let me see.

1346
01:17:51,421 --> 01:17:56,421
I think in one way I think I was 
fortunate that I had tenure by the time 

1347
01:17:56,421 --> 01:18:00,530
the book was published and my university
is a vital,

1348
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:02,570
larger tolerant case.
We have some,

1349
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:08,080
some issues here,
but by and large my colleagues on a 

1350
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,890
reasonable decent people,
uh,

1351
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:14,180
and uh,
I was able to get tenure on the strength

1352
01:18:14,181 --> 01:18:18,020
of my teaching abilities and my,
my publication.

1353
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:21,620
Um,
so it wasn't that I was going to lose my

1354
01:18:21,621 --> 01:18:25,820
job right over this fracture.
First areas,

1355
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:30,850
there's blow back.
I did have difficulty getting the book 

1356
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:33,161
published right in the first place.
Actually I finished writing the book by 

1357
01:18:33,161 --> 01:18:37,210
the year 2000.
I had taken a sabbatical from 1999 to 

1358
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:40,400
2010.
I was not able to get the book published

1359
01:18:40,401 --> 01:18:45,401
until 2004.
And a reason for that was a number of 

1360
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:49,550
desk rejections.
You know,

1361
01:18:49,551 --> 01:18:53,300
the editor sends a form letter back for 
very few of those,

1362
01:18:53,301 --> 01:18:55,760
but more seriously what happened three 
times,

1363
01:18:55,761 --> 01:19:00,761
possibly four times,
I don't remember exactly now was that 

1364
01:19:00,761 --> 01:19:00,761
would get past the,
uh,

1365
01:19:00,761 --> 01:19:05,141
the,
the editor at the press and then it 

1366
01:19:05,141 --> 01:19:05,240
really sent out to two or three 
reviewers.

1367
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:10,750
And in each case what happened was I 
would get split and poor I slipped a 

1368
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,820
review for at one would come back and 
say,

1369
01:19:14,210 --> 01:19:15,650
yeah,
this is a really good book.

1370
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:18,440
You've done his homework.
It's a good argument,

1371
01:19:18,441 --> 01:19:21,830
is a fresh argument.
Don't necessarily agree with all of it,

1372
01:19:21,831 --> 01:19:24,410
but this really ought to be out there 
right as a book.

1373
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:28,920
And then the other review or the other 
two reviews on the other side would be a

1374
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:33,970
equally savaging at this terrible book,
or he doesn't know his history of 

1375
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:35,810
philosophy.
He butchered the sat or act or the other

1376
01:19:35,811 --> 01:19:39,070
thing and I strongly recommend that you 
don't like publishes books.

1377
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:41,630
And then almost always in that 
situation,

1378
01:19:41,631 --> 01:19:42,160
the,
uh,

1379
01:19:42,161 --> 01:19:47,161
the editor just said no.
So it wasn't until 2000 and I guess late

1380
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:52,660
2003 a or few thousand for a scholar,
ged,

1381
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:55,340
which was at a small press working out 
of Arizona,

1382
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:56,950
uh,
took the book on.

1383
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,160
And I'm happy to say that to accurate 
published.

1384
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:04,930
It's an imprint consistently since then.
So remarkable.

1385
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:09,950
Just remarkable how many book,
let alone an academic book and then 

1386
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:12,520
multiple translations and those 
continue.

1387
01:20:12,521 --> 01:20:13,810
So,
so,

1388
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:18,820
so I'm happy about that now to say the 
scholar and the responses have been from

1389
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:27,460
the moderate liberal,
also kind of traditional the one who 

1390
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:28,950
used the word necessarily traditional,
but the rational,

1391
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:32,700
naturalistic liberal right thinkers,
uh,

1392
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:37,090
conservatives and libertarians that 
reviews have all been strong,

1393
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:42,140
strongly positive or not received any 
formal reviews from any of the 

1394
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:47,990
postmodern for or far left journals.
So I'm not sure what that means,

1395
01:20:50,071 --> 01:20:55,071
but there is a,
at least some level of unwillingness to 

1396
01:20:55,071 --> 01:20:57,020
engage with might be a sign of respect.
Well,

1397
01:20:57,030 --> 01:21:00,180
there is one sign of respect that comes 
out and that is that every,

1398
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:03,750
let's say once a year,
so probably a dozen times since the book

1399
01:21:03,751 --> 01:21:08,751
has been published,
I've been asked by the editor of a 

1400
01:21:08,751 --> 01:21:12,950
postmodern foreclose fellow traveler,
a critical theory type of journal to be 

1401
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:15,690
a second reviewer right on one of your 
articles.

1402
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:19,200
So I'm in their Rolodex,
so to speak.

1403
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:24,640
We use the old fashioned label has that 
when they are actually looking for 

1404
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:28,461
someone who's likely to give an 
objective but critical respect 

1405
01:21:28,461 --> 01:21:32,090
perspective on some articles to be 
submitted to the journal once in a while

1406
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:34,290
my name floats up and they'll send it 
out to me.

1407
01:21:34,291 --> 01:21:37,920
So I'll just do the standard thing of 
reading it and getting my mindset,

1408
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:41,670
my professional opinion on that.
So I think when they are aware of me,

1409
01:21:41,671 --> 01:21:44,850
but there hasn't really been any direct 
intellectual engagement.

1410
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:46,440
Kind of sad.

1411
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:50,750
When you set yourself up to write the 
book,

1412
01:21:51,290 --> 01:21:55,400
were you thinking of writing a critique 
of postmodernism or,

1413
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:59,570
or were you thinking of conducting an 
exploration of postmodernism?

1414
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:03,230
Right now I'm working on the critique or
the,

1415
01:22:03,231 --> 01:22:05,100
the book ends,
uh,

1416
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,040
I don't want to say abruptly because it 
did set out the purpose of.

1417
01:22:08,041 --> 01:22:10,440
It does,
but it doesn't end with the door open,

1418
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:14,590
right.
To say how then do we respond to a,

1419
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:19,620
this is this dead end of counter 
enlightenment thought or in 

1420
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:20,790
postmodernism are.
So we're at a point culture.

1421
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:25,820
We were that the meaning of 
postmodernism has now it's infected the 

1422
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:27,140
academy.
And we see problems there,

1423
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:32,150
but it's also left the academy and so 
for people outside the academy are 

1424
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:34,830
seeing results.
And so the big question is what do we do

1425
01:22:34,831 --> 01:22:35,400
next?
So,

1426
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:38,270
so I am actively working on the sequel 
to,

1427
01:22:38,271 --> 01:22:40,680
uh,
to explaining postmodernism now.

1428
01:22:41,210 --> 01:22:43,770
And I did go back and forth in the 
writing.

1429
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:49,070
My first purpose was to write a straight
diagnosis and intellectual history of 

1430
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:50,070
postmodernism.

1431
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:55,700
And uh,
that's where I ended up leaving it 

1432
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:57,990
because in one sense this is a bit 
artificial,

1433
01:22:57,991 --> 01:23:02,991
but I really liked 200 page books.
It's a kind of long enough for you to 

1434
01:23:02,991 --> 01:23:07,731
get into a subject deeply enough and to 
make a good point in integrated argument

1435
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:13,350
and then stop.
And so I realized if I wrote the sequel 

1436
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:18,241
then it would be a 400 page book.
And I thought it was more important to 

1437
01:23:18,241 --> 01:23:21,070
get this self contained intellectual 
history of postmodernism out there.

1438
01:23:21,071 --> 01:23:26,071
So I brought things to a logical 
conclusion right where I ended the book 

1439
01:23:26,621 --> 01:23:28,420
and,
and now I'm working on

1440
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:34,440
which the next one called just as a,

1441
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:37,720
the working title of something.
And it changes every year,

1442
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:38,800
every few months,
right?

1443
01:23:38,801 --> 01:23:39,340
Or,
or,

1444
01:23:39,341 --> 01:23:44,341
so sometimes I think about it,
the fate of the enlightenment or 

1445
01:23:44,341 --> 01:23:45,490
something to do with the neo 
enlightenment,

1446
01:23:46,110 --> 01:23:49,790
uh,
or it won't be this,

1447
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:54,640
but post postmodernism or after 
postmodernism something.

1448
01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:00,760
Yeah,
we've been struggling with terminology 

1449
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:00,760
as well.
Absolutely.

1450
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:00,760
Talking about with such things.

1451
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:04,020
And it's a very hard thing to do because
it's a,

1452
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:06,880
as we've seen Phyllis philosophically,
right?

1453
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:11,200
Postmodernism is multidimensional.
It's a metaphysical critique,

1454
01:24:11,201 --> 01:24:13,720
it's informative critique,
it's a political critique,

1455
01:24:13,721 --> 01:24:16,000
it's an epistemological right set of 
views.

1456
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:20,520
And so the alternative then also has to 
be integrated philosophical.

1457
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:22,530
There has to be an entire prosoft 
package.

1458
01:24:22,531 --> 01:24:24,330
And so what,
uh,

1459
01:24:24,370 --> 01:24:27,190
what label is going to capture all of 
that,

1460
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:32,830
uh,
and at the same time make a connection 

1461
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:33,650
to postmodernism.
And also,

1462
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:34,820
uh,
I'm,

1463
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:37,360
I'm basically an optimistic positive 
guy.

1464
01:24:37,361 --> 01:24:38,480
So I want something that,

1465
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:42,620
that has a as a way forward.
Yeah,

1466
01:24:42,621 --> 01:24:43,490
that's right.
Yeah.

1467
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:47,570
Make it a better place.
Right?

1468
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:48,400
Right.
Exactly.

1469
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:49,430
Exactly.
So,

1470
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:54,790
look,
I think an hour and a half interview is 

1471
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:54,800
approximately the equivalent of a 200 
page book.

1472
01:24:56,230 --> 01:25:01,230
So why don't we,
why don't we end with that and what I 

1473
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:04,931
would like to propose is that we have 
another discussion in a couple of months

1474
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:10,310
about what you're thinking about with 
regards to what you're writing.

1475
01:25:10,311 --> 01:25:15,311
Now.
We've covered the intellectual 

1476
01:25:15,311 --> 01:25:18,551
territory.
We've covered the historical territory 

1477
01:25:18,551 --> 01:25:18,551
and done a reasonable reasonably good 
job,

1478
01:25:18,551 --> 01:25:23,111
I think of both justifying posts,
postmodernism in this discussion and 

1479
01:25:23,111 --> 01:25:25,820
also pointing out its pitfalls and 
dangers.

1480
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:31,750
We haven't outlined a much for an 
alternative vision except making 

1481
01:25:33,351 --> 01:25:37,670
tangential reference to the potency of 
individual capacity.

1482
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:41,900
That seems to be.
That would seem to be reasonable grounds

1483
01:25:41,901 --> 01:25:43,550
for the next discussion.
So

1484
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:50,320
the next time we chat,
right talking about the current culture 

1485
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:50,320
war issues,
you know,

1486
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:54,470
one of the things I'm very interested in
is younger people in particular who are 

1487
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:57,150
in the front lines in universities,
so to speak,

1488
01:25:57,151 --> 01:26:02,151
and they're surrounded in a bewildered 
and angry and in some cases intimidated 

1489
01:26:02,611 --> 01:26:04,040
by all of

1490
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:08,870
the microaggressions and so forth and 
the indoctrination of getting.

1491
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:14,270
But I'm actually kind of glad that we 
didn't talk about the political end of 

1492
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:17,921
it today because it enabled us to have a
conversation that was almost entirely 

1493
01:26:17,921 --> 01:26:19,490
philosophical in nature and I really 
think that's the right,

1494
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:24,960
that's the right level of analysis 
because the battle that's occurring in 

1495
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:28,661
our culture is actually occurring at a 
philosophical level and there's other 

1496
01:26:28,661 --> 01:26:28,661
levels as well.
But that's,

1497
01:26:28,661 --> 01:26:33,630
that's,
that's even more important than the 

1498
01:26:33,630 --> 01:26:33,630
political level as far as I'm concerned.
Well said.

1499
01:26:33,630 --> 01:26:36,730
I agree 100 percent nicely.
Right.

1500
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:38,540
Well it was a pleasure speaking with 
you.

1501
01:26:38,541 --> 01:26:43,541
Is very much worthwhile or do you have a
remarkable capacity for tracking the 

1502
01:26:43,541 --> 01:26:48,101
content of conversations and on point.
So that's quite amazing to see because 

1503
01:26:48,110 --> 01:26:53,110
we did branch out and a lot of different
directions more or less similar 

1504
01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:56,160
caneously it was quite helpful in 
keeping the chorus on track that you 

1505
01:26:56,661 --> 01:26:59,990
could so rapidly organized the,
you know,

1506
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,810
it was almost like you're putting a 
paragraph structure in the conversation,

1507
01:27:02,811 --> 01:27:07,811
ask occurred.
So that was something that was really 

1508
01:27:07,811 --> 01:27:07,811
interesting to see.
So anyways,

1509
01:27:07,811 --> 01:27:11,891
it was a pleasure meeting you and thanks
very much for talking with me and I'll 

1510
01:27:11,891 --> 01:27:13,640
obviously input recommend book like.
Sorry,

1511
01:27:13,641 --> 01:27:18,641
go ahead.
I want to say much respect for the work 

1512
01:27:18,641 --> 01:27:18,641
you're doing.
Thanks for having me on your show.

1513
01:27:18,641 --> 01:27:19,820
Be Happy to talk again.
Great,

1514
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,410
good.
We'll set that up right.

1515
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:23,420
Thanks Jordan.
Bye.

1516
01:27:23,421 --> 01:27:23,660
Bye.
