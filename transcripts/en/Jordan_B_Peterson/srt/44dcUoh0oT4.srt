1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,030
So the last time we met,
we talked about a Greek myth,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,680
I believe.
Is that correct?

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,790
We talked about horace and Isis and.
Okay,

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:14,723
good.
So I want to talk to you about this 

5
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:28,290
symbol today,
which reminds me.

6
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,720
There's another slide that I need to use
to do that.

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,093
Hmm.

8
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:38,803
This took me a long time to sort out.
It looks to me like Ms Dot lg uses to 

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,993
classic myth and the symbols that are 
associated with classic myth use two 

10
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,853
different symbols to represent the 
unknown and one of them as far as I can 

11
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:59,690
tell,
represents the absolute unknown.

12
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:05,910
And so that would be things that.
It's a complicated conceptual category.

13
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,533
All these are because otherwise they 
would be articulated and explicit 

14
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:11,864
categories instead of images stick and 
artistic categories and so they're 

15
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:17,744
trying to.

16
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,283
The symbols express a very large variety
of things that are difficult to 

17
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:28,860
formulate into an explicit set.
Now,

18
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:31,290
one of the theories that young had about
symbols,

19
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,630
which I really like.
It's different than the Freudian idea.

20
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:36,893
Now.
Freud believed that your mind produced 

21
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:43,191
symbols to represent content that you 
repressed.

22
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,310
Basically.
Maybe it does that from time to time,

23
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,030
but you thought of the symbol in a 
different way.

24
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:58,440
He thought of it as something that 
floated up from the depths so to speak.

25
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,770
I actually think that's the right way of
thinking about it.

26
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,630
Like a dream.
Now,

27
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,570
we don't really know much about 
consciousness.

28
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,553
It's proved very elusive to scientific 
study and we don't really know much 

29
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:15,744
about the process by which the 
understanding of very complex concepts 

30
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:22,410
comes about.
What we've started to take that apart to

31
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:24,000
some degree in the class,

32
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,723
you're often confronted with things that
you don't understand and can't control 

33
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,313
and it's necessary to categorize those 
because you have to figure out how to 

34
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:39,764
deal with them and we've already 
established the proposition that most 

35
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:48,830
human categories that are,
that are fundamental art associated with

36
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:49,664
action rather than than representation.
Or you could think in some sense that 

37
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:55,130
the action is the representation,
right?

38
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,010
Which which would mean you might say,
well,

39
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:02,050
what's a monster where we could even do 
something simpler.

40
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:04,780
We can say what's a chair?
And I could say,

41
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:05,750
well,
a chair,

42
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:06,584
it could be a beanbag and a chair.
It could be a stump and that you might 

43
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:10,474
ask,
well,

44
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,793
a chair in a beanbag and a stump have 
virtually nothing in common apart from 

45
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:17,770
the fact that they're both made out of 
matter.

46
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,413
They're very dissimilar entities and yet
you can encapsulate them under the same 

47
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:23,824
headache and the reason for that is 
because you can sit on and so the 

48
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:27,994
categories are actually predicated on 
the use and we've talked about the idea 

49
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:31,924
that we categorize things as as tools or
or that we categorize them in 

50
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:36,640
relationship to their

51
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,493
there

52
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,170
implication for action.

53
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,653
Now

54
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:52,660
there were mammalian creatures around 
between 60 and 220 million years ago.

55
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,070
This is very long time.
It's,

56
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,943
it's long enough for those mammals to 
have been overlapping with dinosaurs 

57
00:03:59,661 --> 00:04:02,390
quite nicely.
And you know,

58
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,980
our early ancestors were quite small and
easily preyed upon and then are later.

59
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:07,814
Ancestors were tree dwelling primates 
and then they were ground dwelling 

60
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:14,480
primates and now we're city dwelling 
primates,

61
00:04:14,481 --> 00:04:18,200
you know,
and there was a tremendously long period

62
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:23,201
where we were preyed on things that came
in from the outside.

63
00:04:24,421 --> 00:04:29,421
That's one way of looking about looking 
at it and from this perspective,

64
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,490
a monster is something that's predatory 
and that comes out from outside and that

65
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:37,324
something you don't expect and that 
inhabits unexplored territory and 

66
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:44,480
something that you don't understand.
It's all of those things at once

67
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,363
and then

68
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:53,050
do to the degree that the psyche is 
transpersonal,

69
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,220
which means to the degree that your mind
is capable,

70
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,103
excuse me,
the concepts so that your mind uses to 

71
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:11,941
organize the world are an expression of 
a heritable structure.

72
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,123
Then

73
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,233
it's reasonable to propose that you have
an inbuilt representation of something 

74
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:28,024
like the Predator,
but it's more complicated in human 

75
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:31,690
beings.
Now you might say,

76
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:33,190
well,
is there any evidence for that?

77
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,680
Because it,
you know,

78
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,543
Young's ideas of archetypes of the 
collective unconscious has never really 

79
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:41,764
been accepted by general psychologists.
A lot of biological psychologists are 

80
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:46,354
interested in it by the way,
because they're much more familiar with 

81
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:49,804
the idea of built in instinct and action
pattern and instincts and action 

82
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:56,740
patterns that are built in can be 
unbelievably complicated and we do know,

83
00:05:56,741 --> 00:05:57,574
for example,
that rats that are never exposed to a 

84
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:06,311
cat in their life will still panic if 
you waft cat older over their domicile.

85
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,013
So rats do not like the smell of cats 
and they don't have to learn that for a 

86
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:15,824
long time.
Psychologists believe that you learn 

87
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:20,294
theory through conditioning and then 
there was an idea that there were 

88
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,103
prepared,
that there are certain fears were 

89
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,040
prepared so you could learn them more 
easily.

90
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,730
So for example,
if I wanted to condition a fear response

91
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:34,564
to you and I showed you a picture of a 
snake and associated with a small 

92
00:06:37,451 --> 00:06:41,190
electric shock compared to fy associated
with a picture,

93
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,930
say of a,
a daisy or even a pistol,

94
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,793
which is also a dangerous thing.
Obviously you're going to learn to be 

95
00:06:47,831 --> 00:06:49,750
conditioned to the snake much faster.

96
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,450
So that's sorta the weak version of 
prepared categorization,

97
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:55,284
but they're stronger versions of 
prepared categorization to and I 

98
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:58,284
actually think they're correct and I 
can't see why they wouldn't be the 

99
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:09,760
stronger version is that no,
you don't have your,

100
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,580
your,
your,

101
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,930
your apprehension,
you're alert,

102
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:14,980
apprehension,
the alert,

103
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:15,814
apprehension that you would devote 
towards something like a predatory 

104
00:07:17,801 --> 00:07:21,100
reptile is not something that you need 
to learn at all.

105
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,200
You already know how to do it.

106
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,563
And

107
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,340
I wouldn't say that that's been proven 
beyond a shadow of a doubt,

108
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:31,174
but,
but we do know that chimpanzees react 

109
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:37,384
with fear to a variety of stimuli that 
they didn't necessarily come into 

110
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:45,220
contact with during their developmental 
periods.

111
00:07:45,221 --> 00:07:46,054
So for example,
chimpanzees don't like bodies of 

112
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:53,690
chimpanzees that don't move.
So if you bring on,

113
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,090
and that's the tie is champion to a 
group of chimps in a zoo.

114
00:07:57,091 --> 00:07:59,340
Say the chimps are not happy about that 
at all.

115
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,493
They also don't like snakes.
They don't like even plastic snakes and 

116
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:07,030
they don't like snakes.
Even if they've never seen a snake.

117
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:09,910
And if they see a snake when and they 
never have,

118
00:08:09,911 --> 00:08:11,500
they'll get the hell away from the 
snake,

119
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,633
but then they'll turn around and look at
it and look at it and look at it and 

120
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:15,754
look at it.
And in the wild they do something 

121
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:18,250
similar.
So if a,

122
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,293
if a chimp comes across a snake,
a big snake say it has a particular 

123
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:24,911
noise,
it makes,

124
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:25,744
which is called a snake Ra.
And I guess that's a representation of 

125
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:30,694
the noise that the chimp makes.
But what happens when the chimp makes 

126
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:33,454
that noise is all the other chimps will 
come running and they'll look at the 

127
00:08:35,411 --> 00:08:37,960
snake.
They're sort of enraptured by the snake,

128
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:39,520
I think is the right way to think about 
it.

129
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:42,490
I think they're in all of the snake to 
tell you the truth.

130
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,500
Um,
you might take,

131
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:46,520
well,
chimpanzees can't feel all.

132
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,740
It's like,
well,

133
00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:51,970
don't be so sure you're a modified 
chimpanzee and you can feel all and.

134
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,830
But there's more to this story than 
that.

135
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:55,963
You ever listened to a piece of music 
that makes the hair on the back of your 

136
00:08:57,841 --> 00:09:00,360
neck stand up or a shiver run through 
you?

137
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,590
Is that a familiar experience to people?
Has Anybody not had that experience?

138
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,180
Okay.
Okay.

139
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,490
You're the only person in the whole 
room,

140
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,960
Huh?
Okay.

141
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,220
Well,
maybe,

142
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,900
maybe whatever.
Whatever.

143
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,993
The shiver.
The Shiver is a consequence of pillow 

144
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,083
erection,
and what that means is that when you 

145
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,193
have that feeling,
you're doing the same thing that a cat 

146
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:32,730
does when it puffs out,
and the reason that the cat does that is

147
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:33,564
to look big and the reason it wants to 
look big is because it sees something 

148
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:37,224
that is inspiring and that's partly.
It's an admixture mixture of terror 

149
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,100
around and

150
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,650
fascination.
Yes.

151
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:48,484
That's.
That's the right way of thinking about 

152
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:50,760
buddy.
What's interesting about the pilot where

153
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:51,594
reaction response in human beings is 
it's often manifested to something of 

154
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:57,190
great beauty or great excitement,
you know,

155
00:09:57,191 --> 00:09:59,660
so anyways that,
that,

156
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,280
that reaction is so old.
My point is that reaction is so old that

157
00:10:03,281 --> 00:10:07,030
we still have hangovers,
biological hangovers from it,

158
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:07,864
so to speak.
From the time when it was actually 

159
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:09,724
useful for us to puff up our for and 
that was a long time ago and so I don't 

160
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:17,710
think it's unreasonable to presuppose 
the chimpanzees can feel something like,

161
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,563
aw,
now I would also like to point out that 

162
00:10:21,281 --> 00:10:23,440
our can be felt to a variety of 
different things.

163
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:24,274
So I think that what a low ranking chimp
feels to a very high ranking chimp is 

164
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:34,651
also something akin to all the reason I 
think that is,

165
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,090
well first because of how low ranking 
chimps act around high ranking chimps,

166
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,610
the act subordinate,
but also because there has been studies,

167
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:48,730
there have been studies with monkeys and
I think these were done with Vervets,

168
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,580
although I'm not precisely sure of the 
breed.

169
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,623
They showed vervets troop.
They took vervets from a troop and they 

170
00:10:56,711 --> 00:10:58,690
showed verve.
It's pictures of the low ranking.

171
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,060
I told you this,
the low ranking vervets,

172
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,103
and they showed pictures that verve.
It's pictures of the high ranking 

173
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:09,391
vervets and the verbiage preferred to 
gaze at the high ranking vervets.

174
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,613
And so the vervets were the high ranking
vervets were the target of their 

175
00:11:13,571 --> 00:11:15,460
retention now.
Yes.

176
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,663
Perfect,

177
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,033
they knew them,
but there might also be something about 

178
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:26,390
them physically.
I don't know the answer to that.

179
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,463
I mean,
we know that human beings can 

180
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:35,710
hypothetically can look at,
are an array of middle aged men and pick

181
00:11:36,981 --> 00:11:37,814
out the ceos without knowing them.
They can do it at better than chance 

182
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,213
now.
They're not exactly sure what cues are 

183
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:45,464
being used or maybe they are and I just 
don't know the literature well enough 

184
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,580
that,
that might be,

185
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,540
that might be part of it.
Um,

186
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,160
so we do pick up cues,
dominance that are,

187
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,090
I think their innate wide jaws.
One of them,

188
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,153
you know,
and there's weird variations on this 

189
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:01,570
too,
so I can tell you,

190
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:02,404
for example,
if you show women pictures of the same 

191
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:10,831
man and you vary the jaw width.
When the women are ovulating,

192
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:15,100
they liked the guy with the thick jaw,
heavy jaw.

193
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:15,934
And when they're not,
when they're completely opposite to 

194
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,810
ovulating,
they liked the guy with the thinner jaw.

195
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,290
And so,
I mean,

196
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,133
I think this is part of the reason that 
women have trouble with men now 

197
00:12:25,131 --> 00:12:25,964
actually,
because I think that from a sexual 

198
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:28,894
perspective,
they might be more wired to be 

199
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,640
attractive to men who produce monstrous 
sons,

200
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,740
but you know,
like powerful,

201
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,060
attractive sons because from an 
evolutionary perspective,

202
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,730
you're much more likely to get a 
grandchild or to speak,

203
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:47,000
to speak in a more Darwinian sense.
You're more likely to pass on your genes

204
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:50,180
if you have a son who's successful at 
attracting mates.

205
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,583
And there's no reason to assume that the
man who will produce sons that's more 

206
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,693
more capable of attracting mates is 
going to be the sort of man a that will 

207
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:00,434
treat you right or b won't fool around 
because basically you're gambling in 

208
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:04,994
some sense that your son will have the 
opportunity to fool around because 

209
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:11,210
that's your best bet.
In terms of moving your genetic material

210
00:13:11,211 --> 00:13:12,044
forward,

211
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,720
why is it that white job,
it

212
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,520
dominance testosterone?

213
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:24,150
Has it been shown that people with live 
jobs are actually more.

214
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,490
Yes,
its teeth we bite.

215
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,630
So a heavy more muscular jaw,
like people don't anymore,

216
00:13:30,631 --> 00:13:34,080
but chimpanzees certainly bite.
Yeah,

217
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,880
they are.
They are.

218
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,090
Wider face is one of the markers 
actually.

219
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,070
Yeah.
Yeah.

220
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,730
So these are,
you know,

221
00:13:41,731 --> 00:13:43,950
I wouldn't say they're overwhelmingly 
powerful effects,

222
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:45,750
but they're detectable.
No.

223
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,190
So know it also goes along,
I think with some things like preference

224
00:13:50,191 --> 00:13:51,024
for symmetry because you know there's a 
higher probability that an asymmetrical 

225
00:13:56,641 --> 00:13:57,474
person has had something go wrong with 
them at some point in their biological 

226
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,464
development.
So people find it symmetrical people 

227
00:14:03,121 --> 00:14:07,530
more attractive and that that's true 
even for for creatures like butterflies.

228
00:14:07,531 --> 00:14:08,364
So there are butterflies that will not 
meet with another butterfly even if 

229
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,820
they're asymmetrical by almost an 
unmeasurable amount is they're very,

230
00:14:17,131 --> 00:14:17,964
very attuned to it.
I think what this symbol stands for as 

231
00:14:29,991 --> 00:14:30,824
far as I can tell is that,
which exists beyond our comprehension 

232
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,940
and that's,
that's different than something unknown.

233
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,850
It's different in some ways.
Anyways.

234
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,303
You remember the,
remember the hierarchy diagram I showed 

235
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:49,480
you,
I showed you that over and over,

236
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:50,620
right with the little,
you know,

237
00:14:50,621 --> 00:14:51,454
the high resolution actions at the 
bottom and then the really low 

238
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:54,044
resolution actions at the top.
So maybe you can think about it this 

239
00:14:58,071 --> 00:14:58,904
way.
So the unknown seems to be able to be 

240
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:06,311
represented by this serpent reptile 
predatory symbol.

241
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,930
It also seems to be able to be 
represented by the negative feminine and

242
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:14,390
it also seems to be represented by the 
positive feminine.

243
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,830
And so Mandy,
if you think about that hierarchy,

244
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,993
what happens is that the trivial 
novelties you know that you encountered 

245
00:15:25,281 --> 00:15:28,100
whenever you do something wrong,
that's only a small mistake.

246
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,293
Those trivial novelties,
maybe their best symbolized by the 

247
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:32,474
positive mother because they're not 
going to blow you into pieces just 

248
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:37,790
because you know,
because you've encountered a small error

249
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,730
and you'll learn something from it and 
it won't be very costly.

250
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:45,440
You might even be interested in it.
And then I think as you go higher up the

251
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:46,274
hierarchy,
it's likely that the positive mother 

252
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,130
representation is gonna Shade into the 
negative mother representation.

253
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:56,690
Because what's happening is if you get 
hint at a high level of abstraction,

254
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:57,524
is that it's going to start to demolish 
larger and larger proportions of your 

255
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,610
personality structure.
And then maybe at the very top.

256
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,970
The thing that would demolish that is,
is this.

257
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,313
It's this for the same reason that this 
is the thing that would eat you if you 

258
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:13,604
went to a far away from your tribe or 
this is the thing that would eat you if 

259
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:21,941
you move too far away from the fire or 
if you fell out of the tree,

260
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,793
you know,
or the thing that would slither along 

261
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,664
the branches and swallow.
You maybe swallow your offspring 

262
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,130
millions of years ago.
Now you might think,

263
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:31,964
well,
is there any reason to presuppose that 

264
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,560
those experiences left traces on us?

265
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,393
Well,
I think,

266
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,293
I think,
I actually think that the propositions 

267
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:43,520
that psychologist started with,
and this happens very frequently,

268
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,593
are backwards.
I think the onus is on people to prove 

269
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:52,190
that our minds aren't structured by our 
biological and evolutionary past.

270
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:53,990
Rather than that they are.
I mean,

271
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,390
the whole bloody physiology is 
structured.

272
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,040
The entire,
you know,

273
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,620
the body in which the mind,
the body,

274
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:04,130
the mind and habits is structured by 
evolutionary processes.

275
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,940
Um,
you know,

276
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:11,270
we know that there are certain sets of 
pretty formulaic cues that men and women

277
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:12,104
use to evaluate each other.
And those don't seem to be learned in 

278
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:16,760
any important way,
although learning can modify them,

279
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,610
we know that,
you know,

280
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,820
we,
we don't,

281
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,743
we're not born able to speak a language,
but we are born able to babble the full 

282
00:17:26,141 --> 00:17:29,270
names of all languages,
so I don't know if you know that,

283
00:17:29,271 --> 00:17:32,300
but when a baby's laying in their crib 
and they're babbling,

284
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,333
they're capable of babbling virtually 
every noise human beings used in all of 

285
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:39,080
their languages.

286
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,240
And then what happens is that they lose 
the ability to babble all the names that

287
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:45,074
aren't used in that language.
And then it's very difficult often for 

288
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:51,750
an adult either learn to hear or to say 
those full needs.

289
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,940
So.
So babies are obviously born prepared to

290
00:17:56,941 --> 00:18:00,180
learn the language and it's not like we 
actually teach them to speak.

291
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:01,450
Right.
You know,

292
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,820
we might make minor corrections now and 
then and tell them how to say a word,

293
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:08,550
but most of the time they just pick it 
up by observing.

294
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,700
And they do it very rapidly and they're 
incredibly good at it.

295
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,563
So clearly that's biologically prepared 
because no other animal does it and you 

296
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:22,920
can't get other animals to do it really,
except maybe parrots,

297
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,840
African gray parrots turn out to be 
extraordinary language users.

298
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,080
Um,
but other animals,

299
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,800
you don't get very far with them.
You might get to the word level or maybe

300
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:36,570
to the simple sentence level,
you know,

301
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:40,260
when people have claimed that chimps 
have got up to the three year old level,

302
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,270
but about obviously you're pushing a 
rock up a steep hill.

303
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,163
It's not,
it's not a straightforward thing for an 

304
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:49,890
animal to pick up language like a human 
being just,

305
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,990
you know,
you just drop them in there and Poof,

306
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:52,824
away they go.
So obviously there's something about us 

307
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:55,254
that's prepared for that.
And of course we can talk and I don't 

308
00:18:58,741 --> 00:18:59,574
know if you know this,
but our whole breathing apparatus is 

309
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:07,581
oddly designed to allow us to talk and 
we can control our breathing very well.

310
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,053
Um,

311
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:11,823
compared to most animals,
we can hold our breath and we can 

312
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:15,520
exhale.
And it actually,

313
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,503
that modification actually makes this 
slightly more prone to choking when we 

314
00:19:20,231 --> 00:19:22,810
eat.
Because most animals can't do that,

315
00:19:22,811 --> 00:19:25,330
but because of the peculiar way our 
throat and our,

316
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,900
um,
are,

317
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,853
are,

318
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,260
I don't remember the name of it 
unfortunately.

319
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:36,670
Yeah.
And brachial brachial tubes,

320
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,160
the way their throat,
I guess.

321
00:19:39,161 --> 00:19:39,970
No,
that's wrong.

322
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,960
Yes,
yes.

323
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,040
The way those are arranged that they 
kind of conflict with each other now and

324
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,620
then.
And that can't happen in animals.

325
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,870
So not only are we prepared mentally to 
speak,

326
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:50,883
but we're too to learn language,
but we're prepared physiologically to 

327
00:19:53,831 --> 00:19:54,664
speak.
And that means we have tremendous 

328
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:59,680
control over our tongue and we have 
tremendous control over our lips and our

329
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:02,920
breathing and all of those things.
So it's kind of hard to believe,

330
00:20:02,921 --> 00:20:03,754
you know,
that we'd have this whole physiology 

331
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:05,704
that's evolved to be devoted to language
without having a biological substrate 

332
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:13,590
for language somehow as part of our 
biological mental makeup.

333
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,383
And you know,
with regards to the relationships 

334
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:20,740
between the sexes,
I mean sex is very old.

335
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:23,500
Sexual differentiation is exceptionally 
old.

336
00:20:23,501 --> 00:20:26,620
The probability that we're not evolved 
to that is zero.

337
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,293
So.
So I'm going to show you another 

338
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,413
picture.
I want to tell you a little bit about 

339
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:39,730
this one first,
I guess,

340
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,730
so this symbol means a lot of things go 
well.

341
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,510
First of all,
it's a dragon.

342
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,790
It's a serpent,
so it's a snake,

343
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,570
but it's.
It's it.

344
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,270
It's also a lizard.
It's a predatory thing and it's.

345
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,943
It can breathe fire.
That's one of the characteristics of a 

346
00:20:58,421 --> 00:20:59,254
dragon and fire is a transformative 
substance and it's a very mysterious 

347
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:03,004
substance.
And one of the things you might note 

348
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:04,594
about fires,
what happens when you're sitting around 

349
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:10,180
a campfire?
What do you look at the fire?

350
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,280
Right?
You can't not look at a fire.

351
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:14,250
It's like a baby.
If there's a baby in the room,

352
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:14,980
a two year old,
you're gonna.

353
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,140
Look at that two year old.
You can't keep your eyes off.

354
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:20,440
It's like a flickering TV and fires like
that for people.

355
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:25,180
We can't keep her demise off it and I 
think the reason for that was that we're

356
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:26,014
all descended from the first creature 
who decided that he was going to play 

357
00:21:29,111 --> 00:21:31,450
around with fire far more.
You know,

358
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:35,110
he probably came home with his furl 
burnt off when he was an adolescent,

359
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:36,580
you know,
and his mother said,

360
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,410
are you out there playing with fire 
again?

361
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:38,921
It's like,
yeah,

362
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:40,480
I can't help it,
you know,

363
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,703
is a mutation that made it impossible 
for that creature to become accustomed 

364
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:49,330
to fire,
was fascinated by it.

365
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,643
And you know,
once we had fire there was no stopping 

366
00:21:53,381 --> 00:21:54,214
us.
So the probability that we're all 

367
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:59,800
descended from arsonist apes is 
extremely high.

368
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,970
What's that?
Yes.

369
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,900
No,
no doubt.

370
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:10,930
No doubt.
Insane fire wielding chimpanzees.

371
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:12,400
That's our ancestors.
So,

372
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,270
so,
and fire is a transformative substance,

373
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:16,641
right?
It's,

374
00:22:16,641 --> 00:22:17,770
it's,
it's strange.

375
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,930
It's this strange mode of material.
If you put something into it,

376
00:22:22,931 --> 00:22:25,420
it turns into something else,
which is very,

377
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:26,830
very cool.
And you know,

378
00:22:26,831 --> 00:22:29,530
which is also an extraordinarily useful 
as it turns out.

379
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,980
So the fire fire is a fire,
is not only a transformative phenomenon,

380
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,910
but it can be used to represent other 
transformative phenomena.

381
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,153
So the dragon is something that's 
innately attractive for a whole variety 

382
00:22:45,251 --> 00:22:47,770
of reasons.
It can breathe fire.

383
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:49,780
It's very predatory.
It's also,

384
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:50,883
it's also an infinite creature.
And that's why it has its tail in it's 

385
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,680
mouth,
it's self contained,

386
00:22:56,681 --> 00:22:58,960
it needs nothing else.
It's,

387
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,400
and this is where the symbols starts to 
stretch beyond the representation of the

388
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:06,700
Predator to the representation of the 
unknown.

389
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,850
As such,
you know,

390
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:13,480
so one of the things you might wonder if
you're a human being is,

391
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,520
well,
what is the unknown like?

392
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,880
And you might think,
well why do you have to understand that?

393
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:19,714
And the answer is because it's horrible.
Things come leaping out of the unknown 

394
00:23:22,271 --> 00:23:24,070
all the time.
And so then you might ask,

395
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,173
well,
is it better to figure out how to deal 

396
00:23:26,141 --> 00:23:26,974
with each of those horrible things?
Or is it better to learn how to deal 

397
00:23:30,341 --> 00:23:32,680
with the source of all those terrible 
things,

398
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:33,514
which would be the unknown itself.
Now you remember ty and Matt in the 

399
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:40,570
Mesopotamian myth when she went to war 
against Marduk,

400
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,140
she was sort of in the background and 
created all sorts of monsters.

401
00:23:44,141 --> 00:23:46,160
And then they all went to battle against
Murdoch.

402
00:23:46,161 --> 00:23:46,994
So I'm going to tell you a dream that my
nephew had and I think this is a good 

403
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:54,671
way of representing what this symbol 
means and remember human beings abstract

404
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:57,883
and so what we're trying to do is to 
look at singular phenomena and abstract 

405
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:07,280
out what's common across them so that we
can learn to deal with the common things

406
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,233
so that we can apply it to the entire 
set of those things instead of having 

407
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:12,050
to.

408
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:12,730
And you know,
we,

409
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,563
we know in some sense possibly that 
human beings can do this and animals 

410
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:17,894
can't.
And so I went and heard Temple grandin 

411
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:23,180
speak at one point and I don't know if 
you know who temple grandin is,

412
00:24:23,181 --> 00:24:28,181
but she's probably the most accomplished
autistic professor and she has.

413
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,580
She has built,
when she was a small child,

414
00:24:34,581 --> 00:24:35,414
she learned that if she built this 
enclosure that Kinda tightened in on 

415
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,130
her,
that it would calm her down.

416
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,533
And she,
she applied the thing she learned that 

417
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:49,790
would calm her down to calming down 
cattle when they're being,

418
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,060
when they're being held in pens prior to
being slaughtered.

419
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,373
And so she's redesigned all the cattle 
handling facilities or many of the 

420
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:02,450
candle cattle handling,
handling facilities in the United States

421
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,793
to keep the animals calm and one of the 
things she's designed is this kind of 

422
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:13,511
spiral enclosure so the cows can't see 
what's in front of them basically.

423
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:17,060
And it's fenced in because if,
if cows are going down a,

424
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,673
a,
an enclosed area like an alley and 

425
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:25,370
there's a coke can lying in the middle 
of it,

426
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,293
they'll all stop and look at the coke 
can or they'd stop and look at a 

427
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:30,860
briefcase there,
kind of freaked out by these things.

428
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:31,694
And if they're walking down a enclosure 
and it's open and there's a windmill or 

429
00:25:35,421 --> 00:25:38,930
something spinning off to the side,
they'll stop and look at that too.

430
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:42,530
Now Temple Grandin and thinks that she 
thinks like an animal,

431
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,880
which is why she thinks that she can 
figure out how animals think.

432
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,340
And one of the things she said,
I remember her,

433
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,480
her,
her presentation,

434
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:55,040
she said,
okay.

435
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,950
So if I say to you,
church,

436
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,460
what do you see in your mind?
Just anybody.

437
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:03,290
Tell me what?
What's the.

438
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,430
What's the prototypical church?
How,

439
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,080
how,
what,

440
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,861
what,
how would it appear?

441
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:07,694
Yeah.

442
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,000
Okay.
Okay.

443
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,480
Does that seem reasonable to people?
What?

444
00:26:12,481 --> 00:26:13,314
What led?
What popped into your mind when I said 

445
00:26:15,411 --> 00:26:18,440
that?
Church bells.

446
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,420
Okay.
Okay.

447
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,280
Stained glass.
Okay.

448
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,443
Okay.
Now when temple grandin thinks of 

449
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,533
church,
she doesn't think of church she thinks 

450
00:26:27,831 --> 00:26:32,831
of at Church.
She can't abstract out the commonalities

451
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:33,914
across churches and she thinks that's 
partly why autistic people have a hard 

452
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:41,420
time learning language because for an 
autistic person there aren't.

453
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,463
There isn't the prototypical church.
There are just churches and she thinks 

454
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:51,300
that's how animals see.
They see the particulars.

455
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,200
They don't see the abstracted universals
that unite the particulars.

456
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,193
And of course that makes sense if you 
think about it and you know one way of 

457
00:27:00,781 --> 00:27:05,781
thinking about that too is that until 
you can abstract out the,

458
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:10,290
the common era commonalities across a 
class of phenomena,

459
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:12,090
and maybe you have to do that in an 
image,

460
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,613
you can talk because you can't use the 
word church unless what you do when you 

461
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:24,900
receive the word church is apply it to a
class of phenomena.

462
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,090
You know,
that may have very little in common from

463
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:27,924
a visual perspective.
I mean just think about how different a 

464
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:32,400
given church looks from different 
angles.

465
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,013
Now,
I don't know if you knew about the 

466
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,190
autistic.
They're artistic Savannah's who can draw

467
00:27:38,191 --> 00:27:42,480
like mad and so you can see some of 
these people on Youtube.

468
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,430
I mean one guy is just.
Absolutely.

469
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:45,264
He's so amazing.
It's just staggers the imagination 

470
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:48,863
making fly them across the city and the 
helicopter and then he can go home and 

471
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:55,860
they own this huge piece of paper.
Draw the whole city.

472
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:57,743
He can.
It only has to see it for about an hour 

473
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:02,190
and he can draw the windows and like 
everything and their artistic people who

474
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:04,920
can figure out how many windows are on a
building with one glance.

475
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,050
They don't see things the same way we 
do.

476
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:10,380
They don't see the abstractions and 
animals don't seem to either.

477
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,723
And the reason I'm telling you that is 
because you got to understand the 

478
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:18,630
process of abstraction before you can 
understand what symbols mean.

479
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,493
Now,
what young believer that assembled did 

480
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:21,534
was exactly what I just described,
which was that there's a class of 

481
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:30,831
phenomena that were struggling to 
understand and the way that we build our

482
00:28:31,021 --> 00:28:31,854
first representations of it is an image,
just like you had the image of a church 

483
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,070
and then you,
you can,

484
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,933
you can label that image with a word and
then you can use the word Madel evoke 

485
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:44,520
the image and that will evoke the class 
of phenomena.

486
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,970
But part of the reason that that normal 
so to speak,

487
00:28:47,971 --> 00:28:50,790
human beings can't draw is because when 
they draw,

488
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,880
they draw,
they draw here or glyphic.

489
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,330
So think about,
you know,

490
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,200
you think a child's drawing of a person 
is very primitive,

491
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,520
you know,
had stick,

492
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:00,151
stick,
stick,

493
00:29:00,151 --> 00:29:00,540
stick.

494
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,840
Maybe they put little circles on the 
feet or something and you think,

495
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:05,730
wow,
that's pretty primitive.

496
00:29:05,731 --> 00:29:06,990
It's like,
that's wrong.

497
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,300
That's really,
really sophisticated.

498
00:29:09,301 --> 00:29:10,134
It's ridiculously sophisticated that a,
that a child can figure out how to 

499
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:18,711
scheme and ties a person with like five 
sticks in a circle and then Maine,

500
00:29:19,131 --> 00:29:21,390
they know that it's a person and that 
you do too.

501
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,880
That's amazing.
That's not primitive now,

502
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:27,200
the autistic savant,
they,

503
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,910
they seem to draw.
They seem to be able to draw.

504
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:33,150
So Dan accurately because they don't see
the abstraction,

505
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:33,984
they just see the particularities.
So another really interesting phenomena 

506
00:29:37,351 --> 00:29:40,020
that goes along with autistic drawing is
sometimes you'll see,

507
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,700
remember this girl who could draw horses
like mad,

508
00:29:42,701 --> 00:29:45,280
she lost the ability later when she 
picked up language,

509
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,740
but she could start with any part of the
horse.

510
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,810
She could start by drawing the tail,
you know,

511
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:54,520
which is not how a normal person would 
draw a horse at all.

512
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,353
You know,
first of all you'd sort of centered on 

513
00:29:56,231 --> 00:29:59,710
the paper and then you maybe you'd 
sketch it in and like it's work.

514
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,800
You just don't start somewhere and like 
draw out a whole horse.

515
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,680
And her horse drawings were like 
Michelangelo Quality.

516
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,440
They're remarkable.
So,

517
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,383
so this symbol,
I think this is the symbol that people 

518
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:13,414
were using or that are,
that we use to represent the ultimate 

519
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,003
unknown.
And the ultimate unknown is a very 

520
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:20,164
difficult thing to represent.
And so this symbol is making a case and 

521
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:24,311
the case is,
well,

522
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:25,144
it's something like fire because it's a 
transformative substance and it's 

523
00:30:27,671 --> 00:30:28,504
something like a predatory reptiles 
because it lurks in places where you 

524
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:35,500
don't expect it to look and it can 
consume you and not an end.

525
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:40,290
It's also something like a spirit or a 
bird of the air because it has wings and

526
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,320
and why that is.

527
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,153
Well,
maybe that's because things come 

528
00:30:42,731 --> 00:30:47,731
swooping down that you don't expect.
I mean there's lots of pr primates,

529
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:51,910
small primates that are attacked fairly 
frequently by predatory birds.

530
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:54,310
And so the error is another place where 
the unknown can emerge,

531
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,353
but the air is also sort of the place of
spirit and the ground is sort of the 

532
00:30:58,241 --> 00:30:59,074
place of matter.
And so this symbol here is a 

533
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:05,530
representation of the conjoined union of
spirit and matter.

534
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,470
And I'll talk about that a bit later 
because that's a very,

535
00:31:08,471 --> 00:31:11,440
very complicated idea.
And okay,

536
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,570
now I'm going to tell you my nephew's 
dream.

537
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,433
So he,
he was about five and he was having 

538
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,980
nightmares and during the day and night 
terrors.

539
00:31:24,981 --> 00:31:28,080
So He'd wake up screaming and when 
people ask them what the problem was,

540
00:31:28,081 --> 00:31:30,510
he didn't know which is quite common 
with night terrors with children,

541
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,620
but you know,
you can kind of infer that he was having

542
00:31:34,621 --> 00:31:37,410
terrible visions at night.
Okay.

543
00:31:37,411 --> 00:31:38,244
So anyways,
during the day he was running around 

544
00:31:39,841 --> 00:31:44,841
with a plastic night hat and a and a 
sword and a playing night and you know,

545
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:50,230
and you might think,
well why would he play night?

546
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,260
It's like,
well it's,

547
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,100
I don't know exactly why it would play 
night,

548
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,953
but you know,
he'd watched Disney cartoons and that 

549
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,430
sort of thing and he'd been exposed to a
fair bit of media.

550
00:31:57,431 --> 00:31:58,264
So his little brain was picking up 
archetypes in some sense and he was 

551
00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:06,040
acting them out trying to figure out 
what they meant and you know,

552
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:07,990
he's a pretty smart kid and

553
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,523
when you went to bed he'd put the sword 
and the little night hat beside it and 

554
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:14,520
then,
you know,

555
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:15,563
regardless he,
he was having night terrors now there 

556
00:32:17,461 --> 00:32:18,294
were,
there were some problems in his family 

557
00:32:19,411 --> 00:32:22,620
at that point and a divorce happened 
relatively soon after.

558
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,633
So there were things lurking under the 
surface around him and he was also 

559
00:32:26,431 --> 00:32:28,860
preparing to go to kindergarten,
which is definitely,

560
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,023
you know,
when you take a step out into the 

561
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:33,300
broader world,
whatever that happens to be.

562
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:37,440
So he was surrounded by unknown things.
Um,

563
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:40,783
so

564
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,043
one night when I was there,
he had night terrors and he came to sit 

565
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:50,290
at the table with his family and my 
family and um,

566
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:51,643
I asked him if he dreamed about anything
and he said he got very intense and he 

567
00:32:55,761 --> 00:32:56,594
said yes,
I was out in this field and I was 

568
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:00,974
surrounded by these little dwarfs that 
were just only came up to my knees and 

569
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:08,340
they didn't have any arms and they,
they,

570
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,760
they had a huge beak like this and they 
were covered with hair and Greece and on

571
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:16,790
the top of their head there was a cross 
shaved in them and they had big,

572
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,850
strong feet and legs.
And when I was walking around,

573
00:33:19,851 --> 00:33:23,210
these things would jump at me and bite 
me with their beaks.

574
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,530
With the breakfast table got very quiet 
when he said that.

575
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:29,990
As you might imagine,
it's pretty horrifying vision really,

576
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:31,640
you know,
and uh,

577
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,840
and you know,
you can think,

578
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:34,610
well that's why he's waking up 
screaming.

579
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:35,210
It's like,
you know,

580
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,043
little

581
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:40,940
peak dwarfs are like gnawing on him at 
night.

582
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:44,150
It's like that's a reason to be freaked 
out.

583
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:48,680
So I said,
what could you do about that?

584
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:49,963
And now you see that.
That's an interesting question because 

585
00:33:52,761 --> 00:33:53,594
you know,
you often think that when you ask 

586
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:57,410
someone a question,
they provide you with the answer,

587
00:33:57,411 --> 00:34:01,550
but it's not exactly right because when 
you ask them a question you also provide

588
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:05,240
them with the seed of an answer and you 
can't help that,

589
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:08,690
which is why it's very difficult not to 
lead witnesses in a trial.

590
00:34:08,691 --> 00:34:09,524
And it's also very difficult to 
interview children because every time 

591
00:34:12,381 --> 00:34:15,680
you ask them a question,
you're inevitably hinting about what you

592
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:18,380
want the answer to be.
But I was doing that on purpose and what

593
00:34:18,381 --> 00:34:19,214
I was telling him was it's 
hypothetically possible that a creature 

594
00:34:22,581 --> 00:34:23,414
like you could do something about that.
And if such a creature could do 

595
00:34:26,721 --> 00:34:29,090
something about that,
what would it do?

596
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:31,643
So I was introducing really what I was 
doing was introducing the idea of the 

597
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:36,264
hero to them.
It's like you're beset on all sides by 

598
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,700
monstrous enemies.
What's the appropriate response?

599
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,403
Well,
I do know if you have a client who has 

600
00:34:48,871 --> 00:34:49,704
nightmares,

601
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,010
you can get them to envision the 
nightmare.

602
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,720
So you say sit down,
close your eyes,

603
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,190
bring the images back to mind.
And some people are really good at this.

604
00:35:02,191 --> 00:35:03,024
I think my experience has been that 
women are better at than men and women 

605
00:35:06,181 --> 00:35:08,820
are somewhat more open than men on the 
openness dimension.

606
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,230
Maybe that's why they like fiction 
better to.

607
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,743
But anyways,
because women like fiction and men like 

608
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,110
nonfiction,
roughly speaking,

609
00:35:16,111 --> 00:35:16,944
I mean there's lots of overlap,
but if you have a client who has a 

610
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:22,350
nightmare and you have them bring it to 
mind,

611
00:35:22,351 --> 00:35:23,184
you can get them to change the ending.
But it has to be some in some cause I 

612
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:27,234
realistic manner.
So I had a client once who she had two 

613
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,790
fears at the same time.
She was afraid of mice.

614
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,340
She was particularly afraid of mice 
running upper leg,

615
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,293
which they will do,
but she was also afraid of being 

616
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:42,480
attacked and raped in the cabin that she
had that was north of this was Montreal,

617
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,343
north of Montreal.
So there was a Friday and connection 

618
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:46,560
between the most fear and the fear.

619
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,240
We treated her mouse phobia with 
exposure.

620
00:35:51,241 --> 00:35:54,480
I took her to mcgill and where the rat 
labs were and you know,

621
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:58,470
first of all she just kind of peered in 
the rats and then she got closer and you

622
00:35:58,471 --> 00:35:59,304
know,
we just did graduated exposure and find 

623
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,034
me.
She picked up a rat and petted and all 

624
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,100
the same day by the way.
And so that was quite.

625
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,240
She was quite happy about that.
Direct behavior,

626
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,140
behavioral treatment exposure.
Right.

627
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,320
And then with the,
with the whole cabin thing,

628
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:14,154
what we did was,
first of all suggest that you get a 

629
00:36:15,511 --> 00:36:18,960
decent lock and maybe an alarm because 
she was up there alone and you know what

630
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:19,794
the hell part of her fear might've been 
predicated on an observation that she 

631
00:36:24,091 --> 00:36:24,924
was at risk.
That was higher than it might be 

632
00:36:27,661 --> 00:36:29,100
appropriate to me.
I didn't know,

633
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:29,934
but you might as well err on the side of
conservatism and then maybe she could 

634
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,920
bring a dog up there that might be 
helpful too.

635
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,310
So that was the practical addressing of 
the problem,

636
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,740
but she had these dreams where some guy 
would break in the window and you know,

637
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:43,883
rape her and so we had her bring the,
bring the dream to mind and then we'd 

638
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:49,704
armed her with various things.
So one thing was a bath and another 

639
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:54,990
thing was some rope and another thing 
was a can of ovens spray.

640
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:58,770
And so when the guy jumped in,
she sprayed him with the ovens spray and

641
00:36:58,771 --> 00:37:01,050
hit him with the baton and tied him up 
and she was like,

642
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:01,884
so she visualized this quite intently 
and she was pretty damn happy about the 

643
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:05,970
whole visualization,
you know?

644
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,730
Um,
and I think it was because it put her in

645
00:37:08,731 --> 00:37:10,800
the role of,
of,

646
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:11,903
you know,
person able to defend herself rather 

647
00:37:14,071 --> 00:37:16,410
than in the role of helpless victim.
Anyways,

648
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:19,710
that was the end of your nightmare.
So that's not actually very uncommon.

649
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,413
I had another client who she was walking
down a beach in her dream and on the 

650
00:37:26,851 --> 00:37:27,684
beach above the dunes.
There was this man who had a big Boa 

651
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:35,211
constrictor and he was showing it to the
crowd and she just walked on by and uh,

652
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,110
she was facing a variety of very 
difficult things.

653
00:37:40,111 --> 00:37:40,861
And I said,
well,

654
00:37:40,861 --> 00:37:41,694
you know,

655
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:46,000
all those other people were curious 
about looking at the snake.

656
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:48,190
Maybe you could look at the snake.
And she said,

657
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,383
well,
I think that the person who's handling 

658
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:53,100
the snake is a,
is a charlatan and a phony.

659
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,540
And I didn't want to have anything to do
with it.

660
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:56,680
So I said,
well,

661
00:37:56,681 --> 00:37:58,540
let's,
let's play with the dream of bath.

662
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,620
And so

663
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,070
she closed her eyes and we went into it 
and I said,

664
00:38:03,071 --> 00:38:05,890
now I want you to go up there and just 
take,

665
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,510
take a look at the snake.
Get closer.

666
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,373
She says,
I'm afraid that the crowd will make me 

667
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:11,643
touch the snake.
So that's interesting because what that 

668
00:38:14,471 --> 00:38:18,790
meant was she was afraid that if she 
associated with people that she would be

669
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:23,020
forced by peer pressure to engage in 
things that she was afraid of doing.

670
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:23,883
So she was,
she was afraid of the crowd and it's 

671
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,410
attitude.
And I said,

672
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,430
okay,
well if people ask you to do that,

673
00:38:30,431 --> 00:38:33,280
you just tell them that you know,
thanks very much,

674
00:38:33,281 --> 00:38:34,114
but I'm not comfortable with that.
It's enough me to look at the snake and 

675
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,290
you know,
probably they'll back off.

676
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:43,291
And so she did that and they backed off 
and so then she was watching and this is

677
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:46,660
an act active imagination,
you would call this act of imagination.

678
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:50,870
She was watching the guy handled the 
snake and she said you can,

679
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,290
because the fantasy was continuing like 
a daydream.

680
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,430
And she said,
well,

681
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:57,130
he's not a charlatan and all he knows 
how to handle these,

682
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,023
these snakes.
And he's out here on the beach to show 

683
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:02,980
other people how to handle snakes 
safely.

684
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,350
And he's actually a good guy.
And I thought,

685
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:07,980
well,
that's pretty damn interesting because a

686
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:11,020
snake handler,
like a snake handler is an architectural

687
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:12,520
Messiah,
fundamentally.

688
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,223
So.

689
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:19,590
So I told you those stories back to my 
back,

690
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:21,630
to my little nephew now.
Alright?

691
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,530
So beat things jumping on him.
I said,

692
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:26,850
well,
what could you do about that?

693
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,560
And he,
he kind of perked up,

694
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,023
which is an interesting postural 
adjustment take because he was sort of 

695
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:32,874
like this before.
And then he perked up and his eyes got 

696
00:39:34,111 --> 00:39:36,630
kinda bright.
So he's excited about this idea.

697
00:39:36,631 --> 00:39:39,300
And I think that was activation of the 
approach systems,

698
00:39:39,301 --> 00:39:40,140
right?
Rather than,

699
00:39:40,141 --> 00:39:40,980
uh,
the,

700
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,070
the freezing and retreat systems,
we sits up,

701
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,170
his eyes get bright,
he's excited.

702
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,183
He says,
I would take my sort and I would get my 

703
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:51,630
dad.
Oh,

704
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,610
sorry,
I'm missing one key element.

705
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:57,030
After he told us about the beat

706
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:03,220
monsters,
he said there's a dragon behind them and

707
00:40:03,221 --> 00:40:06,100
the dragon is puffing out,
smoke and fire.

708
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,110
And every time it pops,
puffs out,

709
00:40:08,111 --> 00:40:12,430
smoke and fire,
the smoke turns into the beaked dwarfs.

710
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,380
And so it's a big problem,
right?

711
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:17,980
Because you got all these big dwarfs 
around and you're gonna be fighting them

712
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:18,814
off hypothetically,
but there's an infinite supply of beak 

713
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:21,904
dwarfs because there's a dragon behind 
it that is like puffing up all the beat 

714
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,863
big door.
So what the hell are you going to do 

715
00:40:26,621 --> 00:40:27,454
about that?
And I knew that that was like a hydro 

716
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:31,240
story.
It's an old story.

717
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:36,190
A Hydra is this multi-headed snake and 
if you cut off one head,

718
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,180
seven more heads grow.
It's like that's a problem.

719
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,553
It's a problem.
Apparently you're supposed to drop a 

720
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:43,954
very large rock on hydro because cutting
the heads off it isn't going to be 

721
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:47,380
helpful.

722
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,400
And you know,
there's,

723
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:52,610
it doesn't take a tremendous amount of 
imagination to notice that.

724
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:56,530
What that story means is that sometimes 
when you solve a problem,

725
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:59,140
you bring on seven more problems.
Right?

726
00:40:59,141 --> 00:40:59,974
And that's actually life because very 
few things that we provide solutions to 

727
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:07,870
don't generate a host of new problems.
You know,

728
00:41:07,871 --> 00:41:10,330
like the car is a really good example of
that,

729
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:12,590
you know,
because we like to think that the car is

730
00:41:12,591 --> 00:41:14,830
the thing to get from one place to 
another end.

731
00:41:14,831 --> 00:41:16,960
But it could turn out that what a car 
actually is,

732
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,093
is a,
an entity that transformed cities and 

733
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:22,330
also the atmosphere,

734
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,350
right?
So,

735
00:41:25,351 --> 00:41:28,440
or maybe it's the assembly line that's 
not just an assembly line.

736
00:41:28,441 --> 00:41:29,274
Maybe this assembly line is the thing 
that transformed cities by making cars 

737
00:41:32,581 --> 00:41:35,360
and also fills the atmosphere with 
carbon dioxide.

738
00:41:35,361 --> 00:41:36,800
And then we all die,
right?

739
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:40,070
That's a big problem.
So at least hypothetically,

740
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:42,480
it's a big problem.
So.

741
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:45,683
So it's not.
It's always the case in life that when 

742
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:48,104
you move forward in one direction,
and even if you solve a problem that 

743
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:55,421
doesn't mean you solved the problem of 
problems and that the best solution to a

744
00:41:56,661 --> 00:41:57,494
problem isn't the solution to a problem.
The best solution to a problem is the 

745
00:42:01,131 --> 00:42:04,490
solution to the problem of problems,
right?

746
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,713
It's a category how best to face the 
world if the world is composed of 

747
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,060
problems.
All right,

748
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,390
so here's this dragon.
Now,

749
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,830
that's when I said,
what could you do about that?

750
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,143
And he said,
I would,

751
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,153
I would,
I would take my sword and I'd go get my 

752
00:42:19,311 --> 00:42:21,890
dad,
and then I go jump on the dragon's head.

753
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,113
And then I poked both of the sides out 
with the sword and then I'd go right 

754
00:42:25,581 --> 00:42:26,414
down its throat to where the firebox was
and I'd cut off a piece of the firebox 

755
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,510
and I'd make a shield.
And I thought,

756
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:33,703
wait,
go.

757
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,870
Perfect.
Right?

758
00:42:35,871 --> 00:42:40,130
Because what he did was so perfect.
First of all,

759
00:42:40,131 --> 00:42:41,780
I went right to the source of the 
problem,

760
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,640
right?
Right to the heart of the matter,

761
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,310
right down the dragons throat.
Perfect.

762
00:42:46,311 --> 00:42:47,144
Perfect.
And then the best part about it was 

763
00:42:48,681 --> 00:42:49,514
though that was that he cut a piece of 
the firebox off so that he could use 

764
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:54,620
that as a shield.
It's so brilliant.

765
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:58,880
And the reason it's brilliant,
it's brilliant on multiple levels,

766
00:42:58,881 --> 00:42:59,714
but the first reason it's brilliant and 
the most important one is that it is 

767
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:06,290
possible that if you confront a dragon,
that you will obtain a shield.

768
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,900
And that that's like the story of 
humanity,

769
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,600
right?
If we face down our predators,

770
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,420
if we confront the unknown instead of 
running away,

771
00:43:14,421 --> 00:43:15,254
if we explore and voluntarily it turns 
out that every time we encounter a 

772
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:20,384
problem we can extract out a solution 
and that solution might be a solution 

773
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:27,350
for all sorts of things rather than just
a solution for that problem.

774
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,980
And so we've had to learn that the 
problem is,

775
00:43:30,981 --> 00:43:31,730
uh,
is,

776
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:34,700
is also the place that generates 
solutions.

777
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:37,490
So there's nothing more informative than
a problem.

778
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,590
Now the problem is that a problem might 
kill you.

779
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:40,663
That's a problem.
But so it's not like we have been able 

780
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:44,924
to make the problem disappeared,
but we've come up with a pretty damn 

781
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:47,924
good way of dealing with them.
It's like confront the damn problem and 

782
00:43:50,391 --> 00:43:52,790
figure it out.
And what do we do?

783
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:54,050
We,
what do we do?

784
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,630
Then from that,
what are we extracting?

785
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:58,423
Well,
he extracted out a shield and of course 

786
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:00,374
that would protect them from the fire 
because it was made out of the firebox 

787
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:06,230
like good work kid.
When we confront a problem,

788
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:11,720
what we extract out his information and 
we use the information,

789
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:15,620
we use the information we build with it,
we learn new things about it,

790
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:19,850
and so you can conceive of a problem as 
a place of information.

791
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:21,260
Now it's,
it's more,

792
00:44:21,261 --> 00:44:22,700
it's worse.
It's worse than that.

793
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:23,534
If that's not sufficient 
conceptualization because it's a place 

794
00:44:26,511 --> 00:44:29,670
of information that has this nature.
You know you,

795
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:30,523
you can't get it.
You can't just turn it into an abstract 

796
00:44:32,281 --> 00:44:33,114
issue because the place of information 
is also the place of horrible predatory 

797
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,100
matter.
Spirit,

798
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,470
reptile.
It's,

799
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:44,530
it's all tangled together in one thing.
We use the systems that we've evolved to

800
00:44:50,111 --> 00:44:54,640
identify rapidly identify predatory 
reptiles,

801
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:55,773
but predators of all sorts,
but predatory reptiles for the point of 

802
00:44:58,031 --> 00:45:02,740
this argument,
once we became capable of abstraction,

803
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:06,820
we use the same damn system to represent
problems.

804
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,200
Abstract problems,
you know,

805
00:45:10,201 --> 00:45:13,170
because we know how evolution works.
It's a conservative business.

806
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,213
Once you lay the platform for one kind 
of perception or cognition and then you 

807
00:45:18,451 --> 00:45:19,780
transform that,
you,

808
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:22,340
you increase its power and generalized 
ability.

809
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,900
You have to build it on the same 
platform.

810
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,273
You know,
it's like that continuous generation of 

811
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:32,040
new versions of windows,
you've already got the infrastructure in

812
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:32,874
place.
You can't just demolish everything 

813
00:45:34,261 --> 00:45:36,460
completely and build it from scratch.
You know,

814
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,480
we have the same body plan as reptiles 
and mammals and birds and whales and not

815
00:45:43,411 --> 00:45:44,520
fish,
but you know,

816
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:45,354
that's,
that's a pretty wide range of things 

817
00:45:47,431 --> 00:45:49,590
that basically have the same skeleton we
do.

818
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:52,230
So evolution is a very conservative 
process.

819
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:58,160
Now my nephew intuited that if you 
confronted the heart of the problem,

820
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:00,303
you could extract out something that 
would protect you from the problem 

821
00:46:03,821 --> 00:46:05,980
itself.
And that's what human beings do,

822
00:46:05,981 --> 00:46:07,750
right?
We're always on the frontier.

823
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:12,310
Some of us are on the frontier

824
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,970
and the front,
there's always a frontier.

825
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,033
You know,
we conceptualize the frontier as the 

826
00:46:19,181 --> 00:46:20,014
place where our knowledge.
And so there are journals called 

827
00:46:24,011 --> 00:46:29,011
frontiers of neurology and we also think
about that as the cutting edge.

828
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,593
Right?
That's well,

829
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,550
what's it cutting into?
Well,

830
00:46:33,551 --> 00:46:36,430
it's cutting into a mat.
That's one way of thinking about it.

831
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:37,603
It's,
it's sort of a variant of Plato's idea 

832
00:46:39,071 --> 00:46:39,904
that you cut nature at the joints.
There's a knife like element to it as 

833
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:45,803
well in that,
and that's partly because of course you 

834
00:46:46,781 --> 00:46:49,900
do use a knife to cut things up so that 
you can figure out what they are.

835
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:50,341
You know,
it's,

836
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:51,174
it's,
it's the symbols are as grounded in 

837
00:46:52,721 --> 00:46:56,110
reality as they can possibly be.
They're not as young pointed out,

838
00:46:56,111 --> 00:46:58,000
the symbols aren't trying to make things
hard.

839
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:59,133
They're trying to make things we don't 
understand easy and the so the symbol 

840
00:47:02,381 --> 00:47:06,700
stands when you get out to the frontier 
is all you've got when you look past the

841
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:07,534
frontiers into the abyss is the symbol 
and the symbol is created by the parts 

842
00:47:12,251 --> 00:47:13,084
of your mind that are capable of sort of
groping blindly in the darkness and 

843
00:47:16,571 --> 00:47:17,404
formulating monstrous representations of
what might be there as first pass 

844
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:25,780
approximations of what it is,
and then of course you.

845
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:26,763
You refine that and you refine that and 
you refine that and at some point gets 

846
00:47:29,321 --> 00:47:30,154
so refined that you can articulate it 
and you can lay it down in a 

847
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:34,810
mathematical theory and you can control 
it.

848
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:37,330
But to begin with,
it starts like that.

849
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:39,303
It starts like that.
Now there is a matter of spirit element 

850
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:46,150
here and there's an informational 
elements,

851
00:47:46,151 --> 00:47:51,151
so I think the best way to approach that
is to think about it from a p,

852
00:47:51,341 --> 00:47:56,341
a jetty and perspective.
Now Piaget was a constructivist,

853
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:59,360
so this is how he thought.
Children learn things.

854
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,930
They would run through a routine that 
they've mastered.

855
00:48:05,931 --> 00:48:07,880
They started out with just basic 
reflexes,

856
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:09,950
so there were things they could do as 
soon as they're born.

857
00:48:09,951 --> 00:48:10,940
For example,
they can,

858
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:11,803
they can,
they can take in milk and that also 

859
00:48:13,521 --> 00:48:14,354
helps them establish an initial 
relationship with the mother and their 

860
00:48:18,201 --> 00:48:19,034
eyes are roughly focused in so far as 
they're focused at all about the same 

861
00:48:23,061 --> 00:48:26,240
distance that the mother's face would be
from their eyes if they're breastfeeding

862
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:27,823
and they're capable of some movements 
and their tongue in their mouth or 

863
00:48:29,631 --> 00:48:34,190
pretty wired up and they get control 
over their eyes relatively quickly.

864
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:36,283
So,
and then they start to experiment with 

865
00:48:37,731 --> 00:48:38,780
these reflexes.
You know,

866
00:48:38,781 --> 00:48:40,840
they can kind of fling their arms around
because they're,

867
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:41,703
they myelinate from the center outward.
So they start out on differentiated 

868
00:48:44,781 --> 00:48:45,614
basically and then they differentiate 
outward and become more and more 

869
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,090
articulated,
articulated,

870
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:51,823
and they learn to experiment with their 
basic reflexes and modify them and you 

871
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:56,360
know,
it's like,

872
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,390
think about when,
when you,

873
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,810
when you're first learning to dance,
you kind of clunk around,

874
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:00,740
you know,
you lose,

875
00:49:00,741 --> 00:49:04,670
you use low resolution movements and 
those are often by the way,

876
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,530
controlled more by your right 
hemisphere.

877
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,100
Once they become high resolution and an 
extremely skilled movements,

878
00:49:10,101 --> 00:49:12,380
they start to be more controlled by your
left hemisphere.

879
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:15,440
So you started,
you sort of start out like Frankenstein,

880
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:17,820
you know,
and you end up like Nuria have,

881
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,340
if you're,
if you're fortunate.

882
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:22,820
So although you probably don't,
you probably stay more like Frankenstein

883
00:49:22,821 --> 00:49:24,470
or at least I do.
So

884
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:27,743
now what Piaget pointed out was that now
you want to remember that piaget was 

885
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,400
mostly interested in figuring out how 
people figured out things.

886
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:38,430
That was his primary goal.
And underneath that,

887
00:49:38,431 --> 00:49:39,264
by the way,
was the goal of uniting science with 

888
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:41,394
religion,
which is something that hardly anybody 

889
00:49:42,331 --> 00:49:43,164
knows about piaget.
But he stated it bluntly and actually 

890
00:49:47,461 --> 00:49:48,294
wrote a novel about it anyways,
so he was curious about how people 

891
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:56,031
figured out things and so his notion was
that a child would be lumping along with

892
00:49:56,101 --> 00:49:56,934
it's sort of low resolution,
psychomotor Schema and it would do 

893
00:50:01,381 --> 00:50:03,090
something that it didn't expect.

894
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,133
Now,

895
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:09,170
I don't know how many of you are really 
familiar with babies,

896
00:50:09,171 --> 00:50:11,110
but they have a remarkable startle 
response.

897
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:13,880
Say so if you have a relatively new baby
and you blow on it,

898
00:50:13,881 --> 00:50:15,200
it just goes like this,
you know,

899
00:50:15,201 --> 00:50:16,520
it's really,
it's really amazing.

900
00:50:16,521 --> 00:50:19,370
And it as a full body startle,
you know,

901
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:21,763
it's quite cool.
So they're very capable of being 

902
00:50:25,011 --> 00:50:26,600
surprised by things.
And so,

903
00:50:26,601 --> 00:50:27,434
you know,
maybe laying in their crib and they're 

904
00:50:28,221 --> 00:50:30,200
looking at a,
a mobile up there.

905
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:31,970
If you buy your child immobile,
by the way,

906
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:37,160
it should be black and white and you 
shouldn't hang the damn things this way.

907
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,010
Right?
Because the child actually is gonna.

908
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,350
He's looking up so people by their 
children,

909
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,930
mobiles all the time and from the 
child's perspective,

910
00:50:44,931 --> 00:50:47,240
they just looked like lines hanging in 
the air.

911
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:47,961
It's like,
no,

912
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,640
no,
they're supposed to be facing down,

913
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,470
so keep that in mind.
So anyways,

914
00:50:51,471 --> 00:50:53,390
the baby's lying in the crib,
you know,

915
00:50:53,391 --> 00:50:57,280
and it's looking at things and sort of 
moving around in like,

916
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,470
like this because it hasn't got great 
control of itself.

917
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:08,660
Sorry about that.
And maybe it wax the mobile,

918
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,180
you know,
so it's pretty,

919
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,880
it goes wax the mobile,
it goes like this.

920
00:51:16,881 --> 00:51:17,714
It's like that was not what it expected.
And then from Piaget's perspective what 

921
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:27,791
would happen is the job would try to do 
that again because it was interesting.

922
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:42,670
So in some sense the first interaction 
with the mobile was quasi random,

923
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,470
you know,
because it doesn't really know what it's

924
00:51:45,471 --> 00:51:48,890
doing,
but then maybe it's foot kick the mobile

925
00:51:48,891 --> 00:51:52,160
and something interesting happened.
So then the child tries to see if it can

926
00:51:52,161 --> 00:51:56,330
organize itself to give that thing a 
kick again and then maybe it'll practice

927
00:51:56,331 --> 00:51:56,751
that.
You know,

928
00:51:56,751 --> 00:51:57,650
what kids are like,
man,

929
00:51:57,651 --> 00:51:59,690
they will obsessively practice 
something.

930
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:03,260
So when my daughter was young,
probably 18 months old,

931
00:52:03,261 --> 00:52:06,350
we gave her these Disney books and they 
were,

932
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:09,920
were hard back.
There were only about this big and maybe

933
00:52:09,921 --> 00:52:13,160
10 pages and there was like five of them
that fit in the little box.

934
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:14,383
Well,
it turned out not to be so easy to put 

935
00:52:15,351 --> 00:52:17,900
them in the box and so she probably 
spent,

936
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:19,813
Oh God,
40 hours picking up a little hard cover 

937
00:52:24,351 --> 00:52:25,184
thing and putting it in the box and then
picking up another and getting them all 

938
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:31,220
in and then shake them all out and then 
she'd do it again and you might think,

939
00:52:31,221 --> 00:52:32,150
well,
what was she doing?

940
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:35,300
Well,
she was sharpening up her putting things

941
00:52:35,301 --> 00:52:36,134
into things ability,
which is a pretty good ability because 

942
00:52:38,211 --> 00:52:39,044
you're going to be doing a lot of that 
throughout your entire life and so by 

943
00:52:41,721 --> 00:52:44,180
practicing that's.
That's how she built up that,

944
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:48,320
that particular subset of transferable 
skills.

945
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,200
Okay,
so then you might think,

946
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:58,300
well exactly.
What was that box of books for her?

947
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,930
How would you conceptualize it?
No,

948
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:03,070
because if you look at it,
you say,

949
00:53:03,071 --> 00:53:04,480
well that's a box of books.
It's like,

950
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:05,343
no,
it's not.

951
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:11,260
It's a box of books for you,
but for her it was something else.

952
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,393
It was a.
It was a phenomena that enabled her to 

953
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:21,151
extract out information about how to 
organize her motor activity and so,

954
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:23,980
you know,
so then I could say,

955
00:53:23,981 --> 00:53:26,940
well to the degree you think it's a 
book,

956
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:28,873
a box of books,
you're just blinded by your own 

957
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:34,260
presuppositions.
It was far more than that for her.

958
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:36,810
And it's quite interesting.
You see this with kids all the time,

959
00:53:36,811 --> 00:53:37,644
you know,
you buy them,

960
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:41,770
you buy them a,
a toy for one purpose,

961
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:42,743
you know,
you buy them a big toy and then they 

962
00:53:43,331 --> 00:53:45,670
play in the box.
So.

963
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,053
So you know,
when it was interesting when we had 

964
00:53:49,831 --> 00:53:52,770
little kids because they would go around
and they do weird things with things all

965
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:53,604
the time.
So we got milk and milk bottles at that 

966
00:53:55,471 --> 00:53:56,304
point in the milk bottles had these like
foil wrappers on them and my daughter 

967
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:04,281
would always use those as sons in her 
little house drawings and show she'd be.

968
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:05,543
She'd walk around and take things that 
we'd already categorized as a certain 

969
00:54:09,001 --> 00:54:11,970
kind of thing and she'd do something 
completely different with it.

970
00:54:11,971 --> 00:54:12,804
That's,
that's in part lack of latent 

971
00:54:14,071 --> 00:54:14,904
inhibition.
The fact that she hadn't categorized 

972
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:17,454
that thing meant that it was polyvalent.
There is many things that you could do 

973
00:54:20,551 --> 00:54:23,850
with it instead of the thing that you do
once you categorize it.

974
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:25,163
So Piaget basically conceptualized the 
unexpected event as a source of new to 

975
00:54:34,881 --> 00:54:35,714
things as a source of new matter,
roughly speaking and as a source of new 

976
00:54:40,671 --> 00:54:42,770
spirit.
Roughly speaking,

977
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,233
why?

978
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:47,221
Well,
first of all,

979
00:54:47,221 --> 00:54:50,760
the novel thing would attract your 
attention and then second,

980
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:51,893
as you're interacting with it,
you're doing two things just like 

981
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:56,880
Marduk,
so this little baby in the crib.

982
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,420
It's like by whacking the things with 
his hands,

983
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:01,583
it starts to conceptualize their 
function as a defined and categorized 

984
00:55:06,691 --> 00:55:07,860
entity,
right?

985
00:55:07,861 --> 00:55:10,080
Because you get a sense of,
I mean,

986
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,520
imagine,
imagine this,

987
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:12,483
like let's say your eyes are closed and 
you have a basketball and there's a 

988
00:55:15,631 --> 00:55:16,464
pillar in a room and you're trying to 
figure out what's in the room and all 

989
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:22,680
you can use as the basketball,
but you can move around.

990
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:23,663
You could bounce the basketball off that
pillar a lot and sooner or later you 

991
00:55:26,591 --> 00:55:28,380
develop a visual image of it,
right?

992
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:31,320
It's a low resolution investigative 
tool,

993
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:32,323
a basketball,
but you could still use it if you're 

994
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:36,150
bouncing off it,
so to speak.

995
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:40,470
You can build up a representation of it.
And so from the Piagetian perspective,

996
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:43,560
that's how a child builds up the 
representation of the world.

997
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:47,760
That's how it creates the world.
It creates the material world for itself

998
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,500
that way,
by banging up against it.

999
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:51,960
And,
and at the same time,

1000
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:56,370
it's learning how to bang up against it 
in ever better ways.

1001
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,713
So the unknown,
which is the thing that attracts the 

1002
00:55:59,491 --> 00:56:02,070
child's attention,
can be best conceptual.

1003
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:03,540
Imagine this,
here's another.

1004
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:08,580
So the child is surprised by a mobile 
that it kicks.

1005
00:56:08,581 --> 00:56:11,040
The child is surprised when it drops a,
uh,

1006
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,373
a clump of baby food on the floor.
The child is surprised when a glass of 

1007
00:56:16,921 --> 00:56:17,754
water tilts over.
The Charlie's surprised when he pulls 

1008
00:56:20,071 --> 00:56:22,380
the dog's tail on the dog barks,
you know,

1009
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:24,430
the child surprised all the time.
Okay,

1010
00:56:24,431 --> 00:56:25,264
so then the question is,
what is the similarity between all of 

1011
00:56:28,331 --> 00:56:29,500
those surprising events?

1012
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:33,400
If you had to categorize the category of
all surprising events,

1013
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,030
what would that category look like?
Well,

1014
00:56:37,031 --> 00:56:38,010
you might think,
well that's,

1015
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,270
you know,
that's not an appropriate category.

1016
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:41,291
It's like,
wow,

1017
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:42,124
it's not clear that that's not an 
appropriate category because the 

1018
00:56:44,471 --> 00:56:45,304
category of all surprising events is 
exactly the category of the unknown as 

1019
00:56:49,091 --> 00:56:51,880
such.
And as I said before,

1020
00:56:51,881 --> 00:56:55,210
it's better to know how to deal with the
unknown as such,

1021
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:57,100
then it is to deal with,
to know,

1022
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:59,290
to deal with specific aspects of the 
unknown.

1023
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:02,530
And that's exactly what was expressed in
my nephew's dream,

1024
00:57:02,531 --> 00:57:03,364
right?
He wasn't going to fight off the little 

1025
00:57:04,571 --> 00:57:06,100
doors,
there was no point in it.

1026
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,620
He had to go to the thing that was the 
source of the trouble and fight that.

1027
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,080
And you know,
that's how people are.

1028
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:19,060
That's what our most archetipal stories 
are about.

1029
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:21,790
So some of you are star trek fans 
perhaps.

1030
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:25,510
Um,
what's the motto of Star Trek?

1031
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:29,140
It's to boldly go where no one has gone 
before,

1032
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:31,470
right?
And everybody's pretty happy about that,

1033
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,680
you know,
and it's very,

1034
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:33,514
very basic archetipal story.
But it does encapsulate the human 

1035
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:39,720
relationship with reality.
It's not,

1036
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,450
we,
we,

1037
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:45,040
we think of reality that way.
We think of the known and unknown and we

1038
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:45,874
think of there being a boundary between 
the known and the unknown and we think 

1039
00:57:48,041 --> 00:57:52,590
about being on the edge of that boundary
and looking over and that's the,

1040
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:55,090
that's the architect of exploratory 
behavior.

1041
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:56,223
Now the serpent symbol is even deeper 
than that because the serpent symbol 

1042
00:57:59,381 --> 00:58:02,860
represents the world before it's even 
been categorized.

1043
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,650
It's like what's there when there's no 
one there.

1044
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:09,880
That's what this symbol represents.
It's the ultimate in the unknown.

1045
00:58:09,881 --> 00:58:10,714
It's the source of all things and so 
it's infinite and self contained and 

1046
00:58:14,651 --> 00:58:16,640
it's matter and spirit at the same time.

1047
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,473
And partly it's infinite because you 
never run out of an unknown things and 

1048
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:22,264
it's um,
it's eternal because you never run out 

1049
00:58:25,181 --> 00:58:26,260
of unknown things.
And,

1050
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,260
and it's mattered because when you 
interact with it,

1051
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,510
you,
you conjure up the material world,

1052
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:33,580
so to speak,
and all sorts of different ways.

1053
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:34,653
You know,
sometimes by actually crafting material 

1054
00:58:36,461 --> 00:58:37,294
things and other times by merely 
defining the material of the space that 

1055
00:58:41,231 --> 00:58:42,064
you're in,
but you also extract information out of 

1056
00:58:43,781 --> 00:58:46,960
it to build yourself out of because you 
might say,

1057
00:58:46,961 --> 00:58:48,160
well,
where do you come from?

1058
00:58:48,161 --> 00:58:49,810
Well,
part of it is there you are,

1059
00:58:49,811 --> 00:58:53,560
you have a biological structure.
But obviously we think of nurture.

1060
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,620
You're extracting information from the 
environment all the time.

1061
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:59,590
Now you might say,
well how do you do that?

1062
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,410
And I think there's,
there's a variety of ways.

1063
00:59:02,411 --> 00:59:03,101
One is,
you know,

1064
00:59:03,101 --> 00:59:07,750
Piaget would say,
well you mimic the world with your motor

1065
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:09,260
apparatus apparatus.

1066
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:10,370
Hi,
you're.

1067
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:13,750
So for example,
when you look at the can,

1068
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,980
this is part of looking at the can,
the can is a graspable object.

1069
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,080
That's the can,
that's how you define it.

1070
00:59:20,081 --> 00:59:20,914
So this is like the can.
And so that's a pattern in so far as 

1071
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:26,264
it's stable in space across time,
it's a pattern and you can match that 

1072
00:59:30,321 --> 00:59:31,154
pattern.
And so it's a transfer of the pattern 

1073
00:59:33,381 --> 00:59:36,650
here to a transfer to the,
to the pattern here.

1074
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:39,050
And that's,
that's the use of information.

1075
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:42,480
Information is information.
It's,

1076
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:43,730
it's,
there's something,

1077
00:59:43,731 --> 00:59:46,160
there's lots of different definitions of
information by the way,

1078
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:47,263
but,
but the information that we think of as 

1079
00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:54,020
information is that that you can gather,
that you can then use,

1080
00:59:54,021 --> 00:59:56,270
you incorporate it,
and then it's in you,

1081
00:59:56,271 --> 00:59:57,104
and then you can use it.
So in so far as you're constantly 

1082
00:59:59,481 --> 01:00:02,330
adjusting to the external world and its 
demands,

1083
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,433
you're,
you're reproducing the pattern of the 

1084
01:00:05,211 --> 01:00:06,770
external world in your body.

1085
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:10,040
That's one form of representation that's
a,

1086
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,053
that's an informed representation.
And then you abstract out of that to 

1087
01:00:13,731 --> 01:00:14,564
make your abstract representations.
But the point is you're pulling the 

1088
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:20,270
information out of it.
So the unknown is the ultimate source of

1089
01:00:20,271 --> 01:00:24,290
information and it can be very,
very dangerous,

1090
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:26,870
but it doesn't matter because it's less 
he.

1091
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:31,990
The human supposition is that the 
unknown is there and it's dangerous,

1092
01:00:32,001 --> 01:00:34,880
but the best thing you can do with it is
confronted voluntarily.

1093
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,460
When it makes itself manifest,
when you're prepared,

1094
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:41,600
that's your best bet.
And that's,

1095
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:45,350
that's,
that's our archetype.

1096
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:47,990
Fundamentally,
that's our bat on reality.

1097
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:49,423
You know,
evolutionary biologists say that we 

1098
01:00:51,261 --> 01:00:56,261
occupied the cognitive niche.
Well,

1099
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:13,740
I'm trying to do that.
It's okay.

1100
01:01:13,741 --> 01:01:16,530
I will.
That's what this next bit is about.

1101
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,680
So.
So your question is perfectly timed.

1102
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:21,533
Okay.
So now I want to show you this image 

1103
01:01:24,481 --> 01:01:27,120
that I forgot to put it in here.

1104
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,033
There we go.

1105
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:10,973
Okay,
so I'm going to walk you through this 

1106
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:17,240
diagram.
So in the middle is an anomaly.

1107
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:18,930
Now I want to tell you a little bit 
about.

1108
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:22,590
So normally it's the unexpected that 
emerges when you're,

1109
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,260
when you're laying down a routine on the
world,

1110
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:25,990
you,
you,

1111
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:28,230
you want the world to do something,
but it does something else.

1112
01:02:28,231 --> 01:02:31,680
We talked about that a lot.
What does it do that something else?

1113
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,620
Here's a way of thinking about it.
So

1114
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:41,943
the word phenomenon phenomenon comes 
from a Greek word famous thigh and that 

1115
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,673
word means to shine forth.
So when the normally is something that 

1116
01:02:51,791 --> 01:02:55,210
shines forth and you might say,
well what does that mean to me?

1117
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,210
And I would say,
well you can watch for this.

1118
01:02:58,211 --> 01:03:02,170
Like all you have to do is watch in the 
next week,

1119
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:07,060
watch the things that attract your 
attention because they will.

1120
01:03:07,061 --> 01:03:09,520
There are things that will automatically
attract your attention.

1121
01:03:09,521 --> 01:03:11,000
You get interested in them,
you know,

1122
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:14,070
or they catch the corner of your eye and
you,

1123
01:03:14,071 --> 01:03:15,630
you have to look at them.
I mean,

1124
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:19,180
and those are the things that are 
shining forth in some sense and the idea

1125
01:03:19,181 --> 01:03:20,014
that they're shining forth is actually 
quite an accurate idea because here's 

1126
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:25,000
the way of looking at your perception.
So you know,

1127
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,790
I mentioned that my little daughter 
would take all these foil things,

1128
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:30,653
make sense out of them.
She was always making one weird thing 

1129
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:33,880
out of something that we'd already 
categorized.

1130
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:34,743
So here's something to think about.
What do you see when you look at the 

1131
01:03:37,211 --> 01:03:38,044
world?
And the answer is mostly you see your 

1132
01:03:41,711 --> 01:03:42,544
memory

1133
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:45,870
because you're not smart enough to 
actually see the world.

1134
01:03:45,871 --> 01:03:46,704
It's too damn complicated.
So you spent a lot of time seeing the 

1135
01:03:49,051 --> 01:03:49,884
world and so you've built up all these 
representations of the world and so now 

1136
01:03:53,191 --> 01:03:54,024
when you see the world,
you use the representations because why 

1137
01:03:56,611 --> 01:04:00,270
the hell wouldn't you?
It's so hard to look at the world.

1138
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:01,823
So once you learn to do it,
you're going to use what you've learned 

1139
01:04:04,501 --> 01:04:06,210
and then what you see is what you've 
learned.

1140
01:04:06,211 --> 01:04:09,450
You don't see the world,
and so I could all even say that as long

1141
01:04:09,451 --> 01:04:11,670
as things are going your way,
you never see the world.

1142
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:14,100
You only see your representations of the
world.

1143
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:15,750
And so then you might say,
well,

1144
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:17,730
what's behind that representation?

1145
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:19,783
Well,

1146
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,730
what's behind the representation is the 
thing that shines forth.

1147
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:26,943
Now

1148
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:28,463
I think people experience this when they
take hallucinogenic drugs because I 

1149
01:04:33,121 --> 01:04:33,954
think what the hallucinogenic drugs do 
in part is stopped them from seeing 

1150
01:04:37,021 --> 01:04:42,021
their memories and then they see they 
see the unknown as such more.

1151
01:04:42,631 --> 01:04:44,970
Although you can never see the unknown 
as such,

1152
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:46,043
but everything that's,
that's no longer hyper attractive than 

1153
01:04:49,721 --> 01:04:54,721
new and fresh and vital revitalizes.
That's what Huxley reported in the doors

1154
01:04:56,641 --> 01:05:00,340
of perception.
And we know that if you're,

1155
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:04,950
we know that if you're predisposed to a 
stimulus and the stimulus means nothing,

1156
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:05,873
so first of all,
something pops up and it attracts your 

1157
01:05:07,621 --> 01:05:08,454
attention,
but then you see it again and again and 

1158
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:11,580
again and again and again and again and 
again.

1159
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:15,540
You habituate to it and then it no 
longer has any effect on you.

1160
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:18,720
It becomes invisible.
I really believe that you habituate,

1161
01:05:18,721 --> 01:05:19,930
I think it's the wrong word.

1162
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:21,603
You habituate.
If it's the kind of stimuli that your 

1163
01:05:24,881 --> 01:05:27,070
spinal cord could process,
you know.

1164
01:05:27,071 --> 01:05:32,071
So if you take a snail and it comes out 
of its shell and you tap it,

1165
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:33,940
it'll go into a shell and then it'll 
come out.

1166
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:35,740
You tap it and go into a shell and will 
come out.

1167
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:36,753
You keep doing that.
Sooner or later you can tap the snail 

1168
01:05:38,261 --> 01:05:40,650
and it won't go into its shell.
And the reason is,

1169
01:05:40,651 --> 01:05:41,484
is that the snail has figured out that 
tap does not imply an event that would 

1170
01:05:45,881 --> 01:05:50,230
require a snail to pull into its shell.
Now it hasn't done that because it's all

1171
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:54,790
reflex,
but in people we still have those simple

1172
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:55,624
reflexes that can just habituate,
but then we have much more complex 

1173
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:03,721
models of the world that we have to 
actively engage in constructing and also

1174
01:06:04,091 --> 01:06:04,924
once we construct those,
they can stop us from reacting to the 

1175
01:06:07,271 --> 01:06:08,950
stimulus.
Now think about it.

1176
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:12,940
Here you are in this room.
Look at everything around you,

1177
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:16,390
which you can't do by the way,
but look at everything around you.

1178
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:19,210
How many of those things are you 
reacting to?

1179
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:25,480
And the answer is none really,
so I bet I could take half of you out of

1180
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,670
this room.
I can take all of the order of this room

1181
01:06:27,671 --> 01:06:29,890
and half of you wouldn't know what color
the room is.

1182
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,433
Well,
right and right as long now because 

1183
01:06:34,771 --> 01:06:36,600
that's all of a sudden.
Then it shines forth.

1184
01:06:36,601 --> 01:06:37,051
It's like,
oh,

1185
01:06:37,051 --> 01:06:38,640
now that has meaning.
Again,

1186
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,960
you wouldn't know what color those sound
absorbing panels on the backer.

1187
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:45,540
You probably wouldn't even know that 
there's those are there.

1188
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:49,890
You wouldn't know the color of the floor
or the design on the floor.

1189
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:54,660
You might not even know the color of the
chairs and and why would that be?

1190
01:06:54,661 --> 01:06:57,930
It's because,
well,

1191
01:06:57,931 --> 01:06:58,764
why is it,
why wouldn't you know those things that 

1192
01:07:01,711 --> 01:07:06,711
you've been exposed to so often,
and part of the answer to that is,

1193
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:08,610
and this is an interesting way of 
thinking about it,

1194
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:13,040
it doesn't matter.
Well then you might think,

1195
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:14,270
well,
what does matter mean?

1196
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:15,860
Because matters a weird word,
right?

1197
01:07:15,861 --> 01:07:18,650
Because things are made out of matter,
right?

1198
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:22,160
But you can also think that things are 
made out of what matters

1199
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:24,673
and it's actually more accurate to think
of things as being made out of what 

1200
01:07:27,171 --> 01:07:28,004
matters.
And what happens when you build a model 

1201
01:07:30,891 --> 01:07:33,650
of what matters is that most of it stops
mattering.

1202
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:35,623
And that's okay because you know you 
don't want to be overwhelmed by 

1203
01:07:37,911 --> 01:07:41,620
everything all the time.
Mean maybe that's a paradise ul or maybe

1204
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:45,380
a hellish experience,
but it kind of makes you nonfunctional.

1205
01:07:45,381 --> 01:07:48,350
There's just not enough of you to 
process everything all the time.

1206
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:53,560
So you zero everything out by building a
model of it and the mortal says you this

1207
01:07:53,991 --> 01:07:55,610
is zero.
It's irrelevant.

1208
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:59,120
It has no bearing whatsoever on what 
you're trying to accomplish in this time

1209
01:07:59,121 --> 01:07:59,954
and place,
and it ceases to draw your attention 

1210
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,393
now.
Then you think,

1211
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:05,353
wait a sec.
Not Everything has ceased to draw my 

1212
01:08:08,121 --> 01:08:08,954
attention

1213
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:11,930
now.
That's a strange thing.

1214
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:13,243
That's a strange thing.
You remember that little thing that 

1215
01:08:15,831 --> 01:08:18,770
Harry potter used to chase around when 
he was playing quidditch?

1216
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:23,120
That's the unknown by the way.
That's actually a symbol of the unknown.

1217
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:28,300
It's called the winged chaos and I had 
no idea how the hell j Dot k dot rowling

1218
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:32,830
knew about the weighing the chaos or the
round chaos is another way of,

1219
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:37,070
of describing because if you put round 
chaos into Google,

1220
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:39,920
the only thing you get is my website.
Now.

1221
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,130
It's something I took from us,
but it's pretty damn old obscure.

1222
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:44,413
But apparently she studied lot of 
alchemy before she wrote Harry Potter 

1223
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:52,370
and that knowledge consciously or not 
made it into.

1224
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,700
She's pretty damn smart.
So it's ad,

1225
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,910
but she's creative,
you know?

1226
01:08:55,911 --> 01:08:56,744
So if you're creative,
there's always a dance between your 

1227
01:08:58,521 --> 01:09:01,210
consciousness and your unconscious mind 
at creative dance.

1228
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,920
Things emerge and you play with them.
But,

1229
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:05,720
and the emerge and then you play with 
them,

1230
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:06,554
like the writers,
I know their characters come alive for 

1231
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:12,050
them and they may just write down what 
the characters are likely to do.

1232
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:12,913
You know,
when there's going to be some conscious 

1233
01:09:13,401 --> 01:09:14,234
direction.
But it's this dance between 

1234
01:09:15,831 --> 01:09:18,710
unconsciousness and consciousness that 
really makes up creativity.

1235
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:19,851
But anyways,
you know,

1236
01:09:19,851 --> 01:09:20,684
in the Harry Potter quidditch game,
what happens when Harry gets the little 

1237
01:09:23,031 --> 01:09:23,864
ball,

1238
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:26,013
right?
Right,

1239
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:26,853
right.
So there's really two games going on at 

1240
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:28,900
the same time,
right?

1241
01:09:28,901 --> 01:09:30,310
There's the game,
everyone else's playing.

1242
01:09:30,311 --> 01:09:31,144
And then there's the game that the 
seeker is playing and when the seeker 

1243
01:09:33,341 --> 01:09:34,960
wins,
everyone wins.

1244
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:38,110
That's the rule and quidditch.
And that's the rule.

1245
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:40,660
When the seeker wins,
everyone wins.

1246
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,480
That's the rule.
And that's an archetype too.

1247
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:47,910
So,
and the chaos,

1248
01:09:47,911 --> 01:09:48,744
the thing that Harry's chasing,
that's the coolest thing because that 

1249
01:09:50,731 --> 01:09:52,980
was the alchemical representation of 
matter,

1250
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:58,020
and it was a container and it contained.
It's like the dragon in some sense,

1251
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:01,380
it contained matter and spirit.
And if you caught it,

1252
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:06,410
then you could inculcate the matter or 
the spirit and utilize the matter.

1253
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:11,070
Now,
back to what attracts your attention.

1254
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:17,810
I hate to say this,
but because what attracts your attention

1255
01:10:21,251 --> 01:10:24,310
is the same thing that Harry's chasing 
in the quidditch games.

1256
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:25,263
It's the same thing now.
It's the category of what attracts your 

1257
01:10:28,091 --> 01:10:28,871
attention.
Now,

1258
01:10:28,871 --> 01:10:30,430
young was very interested in this.

1259
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:37,343
He thought that what attracted your 
attention was a consequence of the 

1260
01:10:40,081 --> 01:10:43,500
manifestation of the higher self.
The self is what he called it.

1261
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:49,230
The self is what you are,
the ego is what you think you are,

1262
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:53,820
and it might also.
That's close enough.

1263
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:55,680
The self is what you actually are.
Well,

1264
01:10:55,681 --> 01:10:56,514
you have no idea what you actually are 
because you don't know very much about 

1265
01:10:58,381 --> 01:10:59,730
yourself and you're really,
really,

1266
01:10:59,731 --> 01:11:00,421
really,
really,

1267
01:11:00,421 --> 01:11:01,254
really complicated and there's lots of 
things going on that you have no idea 

1268
01:11:03,811 --> 01:11:04,644
about.
And the world is a really strange place 

1269
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:07,403
and the self is also the thing that you 
are now and the thing that you were and 

1270
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:13,290
all of the things that you could 
potentially become.

1271
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:14,543
And that's a strange idea.
So maybe you guys can help me think 

1272
01:11:18,301 --> 01:11:19,090
about this.
You know,

1273
01:11:19,090 --> 01:11:22,560
because I'd been thinking for a long 
time about these sorts of things,

1274
01:11:22,561 --> 01:11:23,370
so there's that.

1275
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:24,001
You might say,
well,

1276
01:11:24,001 --> 01:11:24,834
is the unknown?
Is that a reasonable representation of 

1277
01:11:28,051 --> 01:11:29,460
the unknown?
As such,

1278
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,750
the unknown as such is the place from 
which matter and spirit emerges.

1279
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,210
Okay,
now you think,

1280
01:11:36,211 --> 01:11:38,460
well,
no,

1281
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,850
I'm saying that's the best definition of
reality.

1282
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:43,620
That's the best definition.
Or we're gonna.

1283
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:45,420
We're gonna.
Make that proposition.

1284
01:11:45,421 --> 01:11:45,901
You'd say,
well,

1285
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:46,171
no,
no,

1286
01:11:46,171 --> 01:11:47,490
no,
that's not right.

1287
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,340
The best definition of reality is 
material reality,

1288
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:51,893
material reality.
You can decompose it down to the 

1289
01:11:53,611 --> 01:11:54,444
elemental and this and the atomic level 
and that's objective reality and 

1290
01:11:58,291 --> 01:11:59,124
everything else is a secondary 
manifestation of that and that's the 

1291
01:12:01,861 --> 01:12:02,694
modern worldview.
Although we don't and can't factor 

1292
01:12:07,081 --> 01:12:08,580
consciousness into that,
but whatever.

1293
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:12,330
It's a pretty powerful view.
It's enabled us to get a lot of places.

1294
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:15,750
So then if you're going to offer a 
counter position,

1295
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:20,520
and by the way,
although it took me probably 30 years to

1296
01:12:20,521 --> 01:12:21,354
figure this out,
there are many other people who have 

1297
01:12:23,581 --> 01:12:25,100
made this case.
So heidegger,

1298
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:25,943
for example,
made the case that I'm making in young 

1299
01:12:27,661 --> 01:12:30,730
made the case that I'm making all the 
white knew that um,

1300
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:35,190
so other people have wandered down this 
path fundamentally.

1301
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:40,020
So it's not as idiosyncratic,
as strange as you might think.

1302
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:43,133
What do you see?
What is it that you are facing when you 

1303
01:12:45,331 --> 01:12:46,200
face the future?

1304
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:49,533
Now there's,
there's a variety of ways of thinking 

1305
01:12:51,341 --> 01:12:52,174
about that,
but let's think about how you act and 

1306
01:12:53,771 --> 01:12:54,604
how you think.
When you think about confronting the 

1307
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:58,900
future,
I would say,

1308
01:12:59,050 --> 01:12:59,883
well,
you see the future as a field of 

1309
01:13:00,821 --> 01:13:02,950
possibilities,
right?

1310
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:04,420
You do.
That's what you do.

1311
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,313
You see the future as a field of 
possibilities and you use your faculty 

1312
01:13:08,261 --> 01:13:13,261
of imagination to map potential routes 
through that sea of potentiality because

1313
01:13:14,471 --> 01:13:16,840
you imagined that you could be a.
or you could be be,

1314
01:13:16,841 --> 01:13:18,460
you could be a plumber,
you could be a lawyer,

1315
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:20,800
you could be a supermodel,
you could be a nerd.

1316
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:22,390
Like there's all,
there's this,

1317
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:23,333
there's all of these possibilities that 
lie open to you and some of them are 

1318
01:13:27,251 --> 01:13:28,084
more at hand than others in in that you 
could get from here to there very 

1319
01:13:31,931 --> 01:13:33,250
rapidly.
So for example,

1320
01:13:33,251 --> 01:13:35,980
if you want it to go get a drink of 
water in the next 10 seconds,

1321
01:13:35,981 --> 01:13:39,580
you could probably make that reality 
manifest itself,

1322
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:40,683
but if you want it to be a billionaire 
then it's going to take a fair bit of 

1323
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:46,420
maneuvering to make that reality 
manifest itself.

1324
01:13:46,421 --> 01:13:50,890
So some are,
some are there and some are far,

1325
01:13:51,310 --> 01:13:52,143
but you act as if what's your,
what you're up against this possibility 

1326
01:13:55,001 --> 01:13:58,360
and then what you also act out is that 
your,

1327
01:13:58,361 --> 01:13:59,194
the thing that can transform itself in 
response to the transformations of that 

1328
01:14:02,291 --> 01:14:06,340
possibility and everyone believes that 
even though they don't notice it.

1329
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,340
And so your parents say live up to your 
potential.

1330
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:17,280
What in the world is that your potential
now?

1331
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:21,550
It's weird.
It seems to me it's weird like it's hard

1332
01:14:21,551 --> 01:14:23,290
to measure.
I mean,

1333
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:24,124
if I gave you guys an Iq test,
that would be some clunky way of 

1334
01:14:28,231 --> 01:14:32,730
measuring part of your potential,
but it's not even easy for us to measure

1335
01:14:32,731 --> 01:14:34,890
potential.
Then you think,

1336
01:14:34,891 --> 01:14:35,724
well,
what is this stuff that we call 

1337
01:14:36,601 --> 01:14:37,980
potential?
Is it?

1338
01:14:40,530 --> 01:14:45,150
It's not the way things are.
It's the way they could be and they it.

1339
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:47,730
It seems to be that they could be a 
whole bunch of ways,

1340
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:53,390
not just one,
and so what seems to happen is that this

1341
01:14:54,811 --> 01:14:55,644
field of potential collapses into a 
single league actuality as we interact 

1342
01:15:00,481 --> 01:15:01,260
with it.
Now,

1343
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:06,260
I should also point out that there are 
models propagated mostly by John Wheeler

1344
01:15:07,621 --> 01:15:09,180
and his school.
He's,

1345
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:13,320
he's a quantum physicist and his 
hypothesis,

1346
01:15:13,321 --> 01:15:18,321
he calls his hypothesis it from bit that
being a piece of information.

1347
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:19,733
He believes that the ground of reality 
is basically something that's best 

1348
01:15:22,021 --> 01:15:26,310
conceptualized as information and that 
when consciousness interacts with it,

1349
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:27,173
whatever consciousness happens to be,
it transforms itself from potential to 

1350
01:15:30,241 --> 01:15:33,840
actuality.
It snaps into place and there is weird

1351
01:15:35,370 --> 01:15:36,600
corollaries to this.
So here,

1352
01:15:36,601 --> 01:15:39,150
here's a weird.
Here's a bloody weird thing.

1353
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,840
This is from wheeler,
so let's say you go outside and you look

1354
01:15:42,841 --> 01:15:47,150
at a distant galaxy.
It's maybe who knows how far it is away.

1355
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,560
It doesn't really matter.
3 million light years away.

1356
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,170
You look at it in a Photon,
hits your retina.

1357
01:15:55,970 --> 01:16:00,970
Wheeler claims that that photon couldn't
have left that star 30 million years ago

1358
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:04,070
unless you're.
I was there now to perceive it.

1359
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:08,850
Now that's a bloody weird thing to say 
and if you don't believe me,

1360
01:16:08,851 --> 01:16:09,930
you can look it up.
I mean,

1361
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:10,963
I wouldn't say something like that 
unless I was reasonably sure that that 

1362
01:16:14,761 --> 01:16:19,761
is in fact what he would say we learned 
believes that the quantum wave form,

1363
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:26,120
which is in,
I think it's something like this horizon

1364
01:16:26,121 --> 01:16:26,954
of potentials doesn't become realized 
until it's interacted with by something 

1365
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:33,554
that's conscious.

1366
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,170
Now,
not everybody believes wheeler,

1367
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,273
but the physicist who don't believe 
wheeler believe something that's even 

1368
01:16:40,411 --> 01:16:41,244
weirder.
They believe that every time a quantum 

1369
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:45,474
event,
so if you go down far enough into the 

1370
01:16:47,101 --> 01:16:47,934
subatomic realm,
you get to events that are no longer 

1371
01:16:50,101 --> 01:16:52,470
divisible basically.
So a quantum event,

1372
01:16:52,471 --> 01:16:53,304
for example,
would be the bouncing of an electron 

1373
01:16:55,501 --> 01:17:00,240
from one shell atomic shell to a lower 
shell,

1374
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:01,980
in which case,
if I remember correctly,

1375
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:05,010
it emits a photon.
So the bounces a quantum event,

1376
01:17:05,011 --> 01:17:05,844
the electron goes from here to here,
but it doesn't pass through the 

1377
01:17:07,561 --> 01:17:08,394
intervening space.
However that happens and then it 

1378
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:14,060
releases a photon and the photon is a 
quantum event.

1379
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:18,140
And so things are quantum because at 
some point you can't break them down any

1380
01:17:18,141 --> 01:17:19,100
further.
So your,

1381
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:20,043
your computer screen is quantized right?
Because if you get the resolution of 

1382
01:17:23,481 --> 01:17:24,314
higher high enough,
you can see the singular pixels that 

1383
01:17:27,111 --> 01:17:28,520
it's made out of.
And that's it.

1384
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:29,930
You can't go any farther than that.

1385
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:33,643
So these other physicists believe that 
every time there's a quantum event that 

1386
01:17:38,511 --> 01:17:39,344
could go one way or could go another,
that a new universe is created in which 

1387
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:46,790
if it goes one way here it goes the 
other way in that new universe.

1388
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:47,713
And so there's like infinite numbers of 
infinitely branching universes and you 

1389
01:17:50,931 --> 01:17:52,280
might say,
well where are those?

1390
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:53,533
And the answer is they don't know.
They can't really detect them in some 

1391
01:17:57,651 --> 01:17:59,180
sense and then you might say,
well,

1392
01:17:59,181 --> 01:18:00,014
that's a hell of a theory.
To explain something simple by all you 

1393
01:18:02,871 --> 01:18:07,100
do is posit an infinite number of 
infinite universes and Poof,

1394
01:18:07,101 --> 01:18:07,934
you solved your problem.
It's hardly an outcomes razor solution 

1395
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:15,020
and then you might say,
well why even bother with that theory?

1396
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:16,580
And part of the answer is,
well,

1397
01:18:16,581 --> 01:18:20,810
there are people that are working very 
hard on quantum computer computation and

1398
01:18:20,811 --> 01:18:22,100
quantum computation

1399
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,680
involves the use of these things that I 
don't comprehend it all called cubits q.

1400
01:18:27,690 --> 01:18:31,920
You be its.
And a cubit is a state of matter.

1401
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,173
That could be a variety of different 
states but isn't any of those yet and 

1402
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:38,813
you can use those cubits to compute.
But the simplest way of saying what 

1403
01:18:42,121 --> 01:18:42,954
you're doing when you're doing quantum 
computation is that you're using the 

1404
01:18:45,151 --> 01:18:45,984
universes that are pretty close to ours 
to do your computations in so that you 

1405
01:18:49,681 --> 01:18:53,430
can get a lot more done in a lot shorter
time because you're doing some things in

1406
01:18:53,431 --> 01:18:54,264
this universe and you're doing some 
other things in a bunch of other 

1407
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:56,664
universities.
And so that's a lot more efficient and 

1408
01:18:58,261 --> 01:19:00,660
you might think,
well sure,

1409
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:01,703
but quantum computation does work.
Now there's even a company that has 

1410
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,600
manufactured what they claim is a 
quantum computer,

1411
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:10,823
although you can do quantum computations
at very local levels that's been 

1412
01:19:13,291 --> 01:19:14,124
demonstrated.
No one doubts that it's published in 

1413
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:18,060
journals like science and nature.
This actually happens.

1414
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:19,043
There is a company that claims that they
produced a commercial quantum computer 

1415
01:19:21,661 --> 01:19:23,910
and people aren't sure if that's true or
not for again,

1416
01:19:23,911 --> 01:19:24,744
for reasons I don't understand,
but the computer is capable of doing 

1417
01:19:27,031 --> 01:19:30,210
certain kinds of calculations much 
faster than a normal computer camp.

1418
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:35,200
So that's all pretty damn weird,
that's for sure.

1419
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:36,513
Now it seems to me,
and I wrote a paper with my graduate 

1420
01:19:38,771 --> 01:19:39,604
students about this and you know,
we were stretching our knowledge to the 

1421
01:19:44,110 --> 01:19:44,943
right to the end of our limits.
We were trying to unite the theory of 

1422
01:19:50,201 --> 01:19:54,160
anxiety with,
with thermodynamics basically.

1423
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:58,360
And we published this paper in a journal
called Psych Review,

1424
01:19:58,361 --> 01:19:59,194
which is a very good journal,
but it's very hard to publish in psych 

1425
01:20:00,991 --> 01:20:01,824
review.
It's the only paper I've ever published 

1426
01:20:02,981 --> 01:20:04,180
there.
And,

1427
01:20:04,181 --> 01:20:05,014
uh,

1428
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:10,840
we're basically proposed that when you 
get anxious,

1429
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:16,540
what you see in front of you,
what you perceive in front of you,

1430
01:20:16,541 --> 01:20:18,370
you can't actually see it with your 
eyes.

1431
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:22,480
It's more like you perceive with your 
body or your body perceives it.

1432
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:23,553
What you see unfolding in front of you 
is a large and indeterminant space of 

1433
01:20:27,731 --> 01:20:30,640
potential world,
roughly speaking.

1434
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:31,833
And that the reason you get anxious is 
because all of a sudden there's all 

1435
01:20:34,241 --> 01:20:35,074
those potential worlds you have to deal 
with and you didn't think that you were 

1436
01:20:37,181 --> 01:20:39,250
going to have to deal with any of them.
So you might say,

1437
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:40,600
well,
when does that happen to you?

1438
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,950
And I would say,
okay,

1439
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:42,903
so it's 20 below and you're late for 
class and you jump in your car and it's 

1440
01:20:47,441 --> 01:20:52,420
snowing like mad and you drive two miles
and all of a sudden your car stops.

1441
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,470
And then you might say,
well,

1442
01:20:57,300 --> 01:21:00,990
what is it that you're sitting in now?
And you will say,

1443
01:21:00,991 --> 01:21:02,940
well obviously I'm sitting in a car.
It's like.

1444
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:06,720
And it's by no means obvious that what 
you're sitting in is now a car.

1445
01:21:07,110 --> 01:21:12,110
It couldn't be a tomb if it's called 
enough and even if it's not a tube,

1446
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:13,883
you're not where you expected to be.
You're not where you want to be and it 

1447
01:21:16,111 --> 01:21:21,000
isn't exactly clear where you are and so
that your body is going to get all.

1448
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:25,710
Uh,
I just saw a dinosaur like,

1449
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:30,280
and it's an apprehension.
It's a,

1450
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,133
it's a perception.
It's a perception that the map that you 

1451
01:21:35,131 --> 01:21:35,964
were using to map your environment to 
define all the objects and to define 

1452
01:21:39,901 --> 01:21:44,250
your relationship to those objects no 
longer fits the territory.

1453
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:46,380
And so then you might say,
well,

1454
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:50,130
if your map doesn't fit the territory,
then what the hell is the territory?

1455
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:54,930
And the answer to that is many things,
many of which you cannot control.

1456
01:21:55,140 --> 01:21:55,973
Now you know,
you might get lucky and all that has to 

1457
01:21:57,661 --> 01:22:00,720
happen is that somebody comes and tells 
you how long it takes you to a mechanic,

1458
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:03,180
but even now it's going to rattle your 
chains because,

1459
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:05,220
well,
if your car breaks down,

1460
01:22:05,221 --> 01:22:07,830
how do you feel about having to take it 
to a mechanic?

1461
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:11,160
Well,
mostly you don't feel good about it.

1462
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:12,001
Why?
It's like,

1463
01:22:12,001 --> 01:22:13,620
well,
you don't know if the mechanic will find

1464
01:22:13,621 --> 01:22:14,454
the damn problem.
You don't know if you might have to get 

1465
01:22:15,721 --> 01:22:16,554
a new car,
you don't know if you can trust the 

1466
01:22:17,731 --> 01:22:19,860
mechanic to tell you whether you need a 
new car.

1467
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:24,600
Maybe it's a $2 part and like he offers 
to put a whole new motor in and then you

1468
01:22:24,601 --> 01:22:27,570
have to deal with them or you have to 
find a place to take it.

1469
01:22:27,690 --> 01:22:30,210
You have to assess whether or not the 
sharp is honest,

1470
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:34,110
so it's like a whole can of snakes and 
part of that kind of snakes is,

1471
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,393
can I,
is it the case that the mechanic to who 

1472
01:22:38,971 --> 01:22:39,804
might take this car is the thing that he
presents himself as now in an honest 

1473
01:22:44,641 --> 01:22:45,474
transaction,
that problem never comes up because you 

1474
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:47,874
just assume that the person in front of 
you is two dimensional and that you can 

1475
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:54,720
assume that they're identical with what 
they say.

1476
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:56,460
Right?
That's an honest transaction.

1477
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,830
So then you're not dealing with a kind 
of snakes.

1478
01:22:58,831 --> 01:23:02,040
You're dealing with a few words,
but if it's not an honest transaction,

1479
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:02,874
it's like what kind of snakes?
So maybe someone stops to help you on 

1480
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:10,780
the side of the road and you think,
well,

1481
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:18,030
that a good thing or is that a bad thing
because the person who's approaching you

1482
01:23:18,031 --> 01:23:18,864
in the snow storm,
when it's isolated is also a can of 

1483
01:23:21,151 --> 01:23:21,984
snakes.
And then there's the other snakes that 

1484
01:23:24,901 --> 01:23:26,350
come out like,
well,

1485
01:23:26,351 --> 01:23:29,640
you weren't going to get to class and so
maybe you have an exam,

1486
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:31,650
and so then there's the whole,
well,

1487
01:23:31,651 --> 01:23:33,890
what happens if I miss this exam and 
maybe that'll,

1488
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:36,120
you know,
I won't do so well in this course,

1489
01:23:36,121 --> 01:23:36,954
and then I have to go talk to the 
professor and it's going to be a big 

1490
01:23:38,821 --> 01:23:40,500
mess,
et cetera.

1491
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:44,640
And so I would say that what happens 
when your car stops on the way to school

1492
01:23:44,641 --> 01:23:47,490
is that everything around you turns into
a massive snakes.

1493
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:51,780
Now obviously that's a symbol,
right?

1494
01:23:51,781 --> 01:23:53,970
Because if it's not,
they're not real snakes,

1495
01:23:54,870 --> 01:23:55,703
but they're not your damn car either.
And you might to the degree that you 

1496
01:24:01,021 --> 01:24:03,450
confuse what you're sitting in with a 
car,

1497
01:24:03,870 --> 01:24:04,703
all you're going to be be as irritated 
and upset because it's going to 

1498
01:24:07,531 --> 01:24:08,070
manifest.

1499
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:08,903
None of the features of a car,
because a car isn't a block of metal 

1500
01:24:12,151 --> 01:24:15,540
with four tires on it,
a car is something you can ignore.

1501
01:24:15,541 --> 01:24:18,300
Well,
it takes you from point a to point B and

1502
01:24:18,301 --> 01:24:20,610
as soon as it isn't doing that,
it is the car.

1503
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:24,960
It's some bloody chunk of metal with all
sorts of parts that you don't understand

1504
01:24:25,170 --> 01:24:26,003
that a bunch of people you don't know 
anything about are going to have to 

1505
01:24:27,991 --> 01:24:30,420
manipulate before it will turn back into
a car,

1506
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:34,200
at your expense and the day that you 
proposed,

1507
01:24:34,201 --> 01:24:35,970
which you had all mapped out,
was quite simple.

1508
01:24:35,971 --> 01:24:38,220
Poof.
All of a sudden it's not that day at all

1509
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:40,560
and God only knows what sort of day it's
going to be.

1510
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:41,791
You know,
it's a.

1511
01:24:41,791 --> 01:24:44,880
it's a perfect setup for a movie.
These things happen all the time.

1512
01:24:44,881 --> 01:24:46,830
You know what?
Someone's car breaks down on a dark,

1513
01:24:46,831 --> 01:24:51,000
lonely road and you know God only knows 
who comes out of the shadows to help.

1514
01:24:51,390 --> 01:24:55,980
It's a classic setup for horror movie,
so the question is,

1515
01:24:55,981 --> 01:24:58,320
where are you when you don't know where 
you are?

1516
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:03,303
I would say you're as close to reality 
is every as you're ever going to get 

1517
01:25:08,301 --> 01:25:09,134
when you are where you don't know where 
you are and it's a bit much to take and 

1518
01:25:15,051 --> 01:25:15,884
so people do everything they can all the
time to make sure that the amount of 

1519
01:25:20,571 --> 01:25:25,571
reality that they have to come into 
contact with is the limited filtered and

1520
01:25:27,291 --> 01:25:28,124
control

1521
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:30,910
and we do that a bunch of different 
ways.

1522
01:25:30,911 --> 01:25:33,400
We do that by organizing our beliefs in 
a certain way.

1523
01:25:33,401 --> 01:25:35,350
That's terror management theory 
fundamentally,

1524
01:25:35,351 --> 01:25:36,184
right?
Is that we organize our beliefs to 

1525
01:25:37,271 --> 01:25:39,430
shield ourselves from the reality of 
death,

1526
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:40,773
but we also organize our societies and 
our interpersonal relationships in such 

1527
01:25:45,821 --> 01:25:46,654
a way that were shielded from death and 
so that we don't kill each other and 

1528
01:25:49,631 --> 01:25:50,464
that has nothing to do with the utility 
of our beliefs and keeping the fear of 

1529
01:25:54,131 --> 01:25:54,964
death at bay.
That's something that keeps the lights 

1530
01:25:56,351 --> 01:25:59,290
on and keeps this room warm.
When it's minus 20 outside,

1531
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:02,020
you think,
well,

1532
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:06,830
here we are in this room and everyone 
knows what this room is,

1533
01:26:06,831 --> 01:26:09,680
but it's not the same room.
If someone pulls out a pistol,

1534
01:26:10,590 --> 01:26:11,423
it is really not the same place and 
insofar as you think it's the same 

1535
01:26:15,711 --> 01:26:18,080
place,
all that means is you're in real trouble

1536
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:19,123
because it is not the same place,
so things can shift and change on you 

1537
01:26:22,701 --> 01:26:25,760
all the time and in fact to some degree 
that's what time is doing.

1538
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:26,683
Okay.
Now

1539
01:26:30,450 --> 01:26:31,590
you remember though,
oh,

1540
01:26:31,591 --> 01:26:33,390
Cyrus Horace Story.
Right?

1541
01:26:33,450 --> 01:26:34,180
Okay.
So there's no.

1542
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:38,460
Cyrus and ozharvest is like.
He's like the way things are now.

1543
01:26:38,550 --> 01:26:41,580
There's a problem with that.
He's like the map.

1544
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:46,110
There's a problem with that is because 
the territories are always moving around

1545
01:26:46,111 --> 01:26:50,100
and so your map is never quite uptodate 
and so you can't rely on no cyrus,

1546
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:55,260
you know that if you have one of those 
google gps now and then they've taken me

1547
01:26:55,450 --> 01:26:57,330
to the,
to the middle of parking lots,

1548
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,250
you know,
because the map thinks there's something

1549
01:26:59,251 --> 01:27:01,530
there that isn't there and it's.
There's nothing there.

1550
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:04,260
Maybe it's not updated.
It wasn't google.

1551
01:27:04,261 --> 01:27:07,530
It was the thing that I was using in my 
car because Google tends not to do that.

1552
01:27:07,531 --> 01:27:08,364
But anyways,
when the map isn't an accurate 

1553
01:27:10,531 --> 01:27:14,940
representation of the territory and 
accurate pragmatic representation of the

1554
01:27:14,941 --> 01:27:17,520
territory,
then you can't navigate in it and you're

1555
01:27:17,521 --> 01:27:19,290
going to end up places that you don't 
understand.

1556
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,620
So the map gets out of date as the 
territory changes.

1557
01:27:22,621 --> 01:27:24,360
So Oh,
cyrus isn't good enough.

1558
01:27:24,361 --> 01:27:27,810
The old map never works.
It kind of works,

1559
01:27:27,930 --> 01:27:32,430
and so you need horace because horace is
the thing that updates the map.

1560
01:27:32,431 --> 01:27:34,380
It's like he's attending to those 
things.

1561
01:27:34,410 --> 01:27:35,243
He's attending to those locales where 
the map is no longer valid and updating 

1562
01:27:38,521 --> 01:27:40,170
it.
Now,

1563
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:45,300
back to the idea about the things that 
attract your attention.

1564
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:49,193
It was either been swagger or boss and 
unfortunately I don't remember which 

1565
01:27:52,150 --> 01:27:52,983
because I always confuse the two 
existential phenomenal logical 

1566
01:27:55,710 --> 01:28:00,660
psychologists and one of them,
and I think it was been swinger,

1567
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:04,380
said that reality shines forth and the 
other one said,

1568
01:28:04,381 --> 01:28:04,651
no,
no,

1569
01:28:04,651 --> 01:28:05,484
no.
You lay a structure on reality and the 

1570
01:28:09,731 --> 01:28:10,564
structure is what allows things to shine
forth and it doesn't matter because you 

1571
01:28:14,381 --> 01:28:16,060
can just put those two theories 
together.

1572
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:17,163
There's something shining in the 
background and you have a map that's a 

1573
01:28:20,171 --> 01:28:21,004
filter and now and then there's a little
hole in the map and you can see the 

1574
01:28:24,221 --> 01:28:25,054
things that are shining through.
Those are the things that attract your 

1575
01:28:27,131 --> 01:28:27,964
interest.

1576
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:30,463
Now imagine that you have a part of your
brain that likes the map and just 

1577
01:28:33,081 --> 01:28:33,914
follows it,
and I would say that's the automatized 

1578
01:28:35,381 --> 01:28:36,590
part of you,
right?

1579
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:38,720
That's the part that's running on 
algorithms.

1580
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:41,330
So when you know a territory,
when you're driving home,

1581
01:28:41,331 --> 01:28:42,164
the hundredth time,
you hardly have to pay attention at all 

1582
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:47,660
because he paid attention 100 times 
before you know the route.

1583
01:28:47,810 --> 01:28:51,950
You can rely on your preexistent skills 
they're built into you.

1584
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:55,780
Literally.
You've built neurological models of,

1585
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:59,570
of the landscape and the reaction.
So here's an example.

1586
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:03,540
You know before you can be a London taxi
cab driver,

1587
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,940
you bloody,
you have to take a test.

1588
01:29:05,941 --> 01:29:10,290
It takes like four years of study.
You have to know the city and London's a

1589
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:12,030
big city.
It isn't that.

1590
01:29:12,031 --> 01:29:13,740
You just have to know how to navigate 
and it.

1591
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:14,603
You actually have to sort of memorize 
the whole damn city and so they've done 

1592
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:24,110
scanning studies on people who've done 
the London cab training process and what

1593
01:29:24,301 --> 01:29:27,900
they find is that from the beginning of 
the four year,

1594
01:29:27,901 --> 01:29:29,100
three year,
whatever it is,

1595
01:29:29,101 --> 01:29:31,530
training period to the end,
their hippocampus grow.

1596
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:34,780
So while why?
Well,

1597
01:29:34,781 --> 01:29:37,240
cause they have a big map.
It's a bloody big map.

1598
01:29:37,241 --> 01:29:39,190
It's all of London,
you know.

1599
01:29:39,191 --> 01:29:40,024
So the reason I'm saying that is you 
don't want to be thinking that when 

1600
01:29:42,791 --> 01:29:46,200
you've learned a route that you've just 
updated your psyche.

1601
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:47,063
You know what I mean?
It's not just your abstract conscious 

1602
01:29:49,571 --> 01:29:50,404
mind that knows something.
You've built the damn thing right into 

1603
01:29:52,391 --> 01:29:55,810
your body.
You've built neuro structures that are,

1604
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:57,033
that correspond in some manner,
some minimal manner to the territory 

1605
01:30:01,211 --> 01:30:02,044
itself.
And so then you can just run on 

1606
01:30:03,371 --> 01:30:07,360
automatic and you want to run on 
automatic because you know,

1607
01:30:07,361 --> 01:30:11,730
I bet you've experienced this.
You go somewhere for the first time it,

1608
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:15,010
it's much longer the first time.
Then it is the third time.

1609
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:16,300
Have you had.
Has that,

1610
01:30:16,330 --> 01:30:19,630
have you experienced that as.
How common is that experience?

1611
01:30:20,210 --> 01:30:22,120
To put up your hands if you've 
experienced that.

1612
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:24,370
Okay.
As people not experienced that.

1613
01:30:24,910 --> 01:30:25,690
Okay.
Okay,

1614
01:30:25,690 --> 01:30:30,310
so I think the reason that is is that 
you're doing a lot more neural.

1615
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:31,173
There's a lot more neural events going 
on when you're doing it the first time 

1616
01:30:35,651 --> 01:30:36,484
and part of your time perception is how 
many neural events are occurring per 

1617
01:30:39,971 --> 01:30:44,500
fragment of time and so if a lot of them
are happening per fragment of time,

1618
01:30:44,501 --> 01:30:47,500
the time is going to seem longer.
If hardly any of them are happening.

1619
01:30:47,501 --> 01:30:50,830
It's like you hardly even notice the 
time and why should you?

1620
01:30:50,890 --> 01:30:52,840
There's no point in it.
You run,

1621
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:55,180
you're running on automatized machinery,
so I'll say,

1622
01:30:55,181 --> 01:30:58,540
well that's so cyrus.
Then you have another piece of machinery

1623
01:30:58,541 --> 01:30:59,374
that's Horus.
That's the thing that attends to those 

1624
01:31:01,121 --> 01:31:01,954
things that the map hasn't covered and I
would say this is a union idea of 

1625
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:06,933
primarily,
although of course you extracted it out 

1626
01:31:08,951 --> 01:31:09,784
from all these ancient stories where 
things shine through the map is what 

1627
01:31:14,501 --> 01:31:19,300
attracts your attention and that tells 
you whether or not you know it.

1628
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:21,393
The map has a hole there.
You should fix it now as you fix the 

1629
01:31:25,441 --> 01:31:26,400
hole in the map,

1630
01:31:28,010 --> 01:31:31,850
you also fix yourself because you're 
building yourself out of information.

1631
01:31:31,851 --> 01:31:32,684
Now,
corollary of that is you have a map of 

1632
01:31:34,101 --> 01:31:34,934
the past,
your past and there's holes in it 

1633
01:31:36,981 --> 01:31:40,880
everywhere and you can tell where those 
holes are because you can't forget about

1634
01:31:40,881 --> 01:31:43,910
them,
so the whole might be you got bullied in

1635
01:31:43,911 --> 01:31:44,744
grade three and you were traumatized.
It's like that's a hole in the map 

1636
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:51,260
because you're still that person.
Unless you've repaired the hole,

1637
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,153
you're still that person and that's 
never going to stop shining through for 

1638
01:31:55,101 --> 01:31:57,080
you unless you go back there and repair 
it,

1639
01:31:57,230 --> 01:31:58,063
and what that also means is imagine that
that whole what shines through is is 

1640
01:32:03,970 --> 01:32:06,700
horror in part.
It's hard on you,

1641
01:32:06,910 --> 01:32:11,380
but it's also information.
It's information and information.

1642
01:32:11,381 --> 01:32:13,900
There would be,
how the hell do you deal with a bully?

1643
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:17,140
And so maybe you go back and you think 
about that.

1644
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:18,820
You really think through it and you 
think,

1645
01:32:18,821 --> 01:32:19,654
well,
how did I get bullied and why did I get 

1646
01:32:20,591 --> 01:32:21,424
bullied?
And exactly what it is about human 

1647
01:32:23,081 --> 01:32:23,914
nature that allows someone to be 
malevolent like that and what should a 

1648
01:32:27,791 --> 01:32:28,624
person do to defend themselves against 
that possibility and how can I become 

1649
01:32:32,051 --> 01:32:33,660
that person.
It's like poof.

1650
01:32:34,110 --> 01:32:34,943
Whole fixed and what that means in some 
senses that you've extracted out the 

1651
01:32:39,041 --> 01:32:39,874
residual information from that 
occurrence that you hadn't been able to 

1652
01:32:44,381 --> 01:32:48,370
or refuse to process when you first had 
the experience.

1653
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:52,720
Now in your brain being no stupid thing 
is it's really concerned about this map.

1654
01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:54,723
It cares about the map and we're things 
shine through because it doesn't want 

1655
01:32:57,491 --> 01:32:58,324
you falling through holes and so every 
place that what you don't know shines 

1656
01:33:03,131 --> 01:33:03,964
through is either something you have to 
attend to now or something you can't 

1657
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:12,120
forget and what you do when you forget 
something,

1658
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:13,073
you don't actually forget it.
You learn that it doesn't mean anything 

1659
01:33:16,651 --> 01:33:20,730
anymore because you've mastered it.
That's what it is to forget.

1660
01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:24,103
A traumatized person can't forget 
because they haven't mastered the 

1661
01:33:27,861 --> 01:33:31,250
territory that constitutes the locale of
the trauma.

1662
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:33,050
You know?
So you might say,

1663
01:33:33,051 --> 01:33:33,884
well,
let's say you're a soldier and you did 

1664
01:33:38,691 --> 01:33:42,530
something seriously brutal in 
Afghanistan or Vietnam,

1665
01:33:42,830 --> 01:33:47,830
like seriously brutal and you can't 
forget it.

1666
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:53,310
What do you do about that?
Well,

1667
01:33:53,430 --> 01:33:54,263
you know,
I've dealt with people who have been 

1668
01:33:54,781 --> 01:33:55,614
traumatized in one way or another,
or sometimes by things they've done in 

1669
01:33:57,751 --> 01:33:59,490
sometimes by things that have happened 
to them.

1670
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:01,083
Um,
in order for people to deal with a 

1671
01:34:06,281 --> 01:34:08,590
traumatic event that involves 
malevolence,

1672
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:11,740
they have to develop a theory of good 
and evil

1673
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:16,190
because it's the evil in the malevolence
that traumatizes them.

1674
01:34:16,370 --> 01:34:17,870
And I,
I think I've told you already,

1675
01:34:17,871 --> 01:34:22,871
I had two clients who suffered post 
traumatic stress disorder because of the

1676
01:34:23,301 --> 01:34:24,134
way someone looked at them once.
It was only one time the person looked 

1677
01:34:27,951 --> 01:34:29,090
at them,
the other,

1678
01:34:29,091 --> 01:34:32,330
it was repeated.
This is a person who been bullied and it

1679
01:34:32,331 --> 01:34:34,970
took me a while to figure out that she 
had posttraumatic stress disorder,

1680
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:37,790
but she kept talking about the look on 
his face.

1681
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:39,260
What was an archetypal look?
Right?

1682
01:34:39,261 --> 01:34:42,970
It's the luck of pure evil in so far as 
someone can manifest that look,

1683
01:34:42,980 --> 01:34:46,630
it's like you can manifest that look,
you know,

1684
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:50,600
and if you're a soldier and you 
manifested that spirit,

1685
01:34:50,601 --> 01:34:53,510
that might be enough to knock out part 
of your consciousness,

1686
01:34:53,511 --> 01:34:54,344
right?
That's what happens to horace when he 

1687
01:34:54,951 --> 01:34:56,690
encounters seth.
It's like,

1688
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:58,520
oh,
eyes open.

1689
01:34:58,670 --> 01:35:02,210
You encountered something like that.
You lose an eye.

1690
01:35:02,570 --> 01:35:03,650
You pay a price,
right?

1691
01:35:03,660 --> 01:35:06,560
It can damage you because it's so deep 
and terrible.

1692
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:11,000
One of the things you said about human 
beings and as such,

1693
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:12,053
and this is the adversarial part of the 
person there a heroic side and there's 

1694
01:35:15,051 --> 01:35:18,650
an adversarial side,
and he said all of your moral flaws,

1695
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:21,980
your moral flaws are like.
They're like,

1696
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:25,640
hmm,
there's an abyss underneath.

1697
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:26,713
That's what.
That's where the image of hell comes 

1698
01:35:27,891 --> 01:35:31,250
from.
Everything you do that's wrong.

1699
01:35:31,251 --> 01:35:34,490
Morally wrong is associated with the 
abyss.

1700
01:35:34,491 --> 01:35:36,650
If you look into it deeply enough,

1701
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:45,800
one of the things young thought was that
if you,

1702
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:49,370
and this is also the same with the 
phenomenologists by the way,

1703
01:35:49,371 --> 01:35:50,204
and it's also the same with Viktor 
Frankl and I believe it's also the same 

1704
01:35:52,911 --> 01:35:53,744
with Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn when he 
wrote about how to stand up against 

1705
01:35:55,851 --> 01:36:00,410
totalitarian states.
It's like you have to maintain an honest

1706
01:36:00,411 --> 01:36:02,810
relationship with the things that 
attract your attention.

1707
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:06,230
You can't ignore them if you ignore 
them.

1708
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:07,540
Well,
what happens what?

1709
01:36:07,541 --> 01:36:11,390
We've already figured that out and you 
don't fix the holes in your map and then

1710
01:36:11,391 --> 01:36:14,420
whenever you wander on that territory 
going to fall right through and when you

1711
01:36:14,421 --> 01:36:15,710
fall through,
then you're going to think,

1712
01:36:15,711 --> 01:36:17,060
oh my God,
the world's cursed.

1713
01:36:17,061 --> 01:36:18,980
Look at all these terrible things that 
are happening to me.

1714
01:36:18,981 --> 01:36:19,551
It's like,
yeah,

1715
01:36:19,551 --> 01:36:24,551
well if you weren't wandering around 
with a self imposed degenerative map,

1716
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:27,920
then maybe it wouldn't fall into the 
pits.

1717
01:36:28,570 --> 01:36:30,470
And that's a very interesting 
proposition.

1718
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:31,873
You know,
because one of the propositions is if 

1719
01:36:35,091 --> 01:36:36,860
you read the terror management 
theorists,

1720
01:36:36,861 --> 01:36:37,694
say those guys think that you gotta have
a psychological theory that's pretty 

1721
01:36:42,201 --> 01:36:45,170
coherent and integral in order to 
protect yourself against death,

1722
01:36:45,171 --> 01:36:46,004
anxiety,
and even though in the final analysis 

1723
01:36:47,811 --> 01:36:49,970
that theory is false,
it's insufficient,

1724
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:53,060
it's there as a defense like a Friday 
and defense.

1725
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:54,140
Okay,
and if,

1726
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:57,620
if not that then you have to 
conceptualize yourself as a hero because

1727
01:36:57,621 --> 01:37:00,470
that boosts your ego,
makes you feel good about yourself,

1728
01:37:00,650 --> 01:37:01,483
and you can find temporary relief in the
delusional fantasy that there's 

1729
01:37:05,751 --> 01:37:08,890
something special in heroic about you.
Okay?

1730
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:10,753
That's a materialist interpretation of 
archetypal reality and it's a powerful 

1731
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:14,744
one.
That was Ernest Becker and Becker was a 

1732
01:37:15,831 --> 01:37:19,040
smart guy and he took Friday and theory 
to its ultimate limit.

1733
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:22,250
He never read young adult and was a big 
mistake.

1734
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,740
Giving has a different proposition.
It's really,

1735
01:37:27,741 --> 01:37:28,574
really different.
His proposition is if you extract out 

1736
01:37:33,591 --> 01:37:34,424
all the information that's available to 
you by paying attention to the 

1737
01:37:37,161 --> 01:37:39,920
disjunction between the territory and 
the map,

1738
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:41,263
so if you let your.
If you let what shines forth guide you 

1739
01:37:44,301 --> 01:37:45,134
and you explore it,
then you'll extract out enough 

1740
01:37:47,961 --> 01:37:48,794
information from that process of 
exploration so that you can build 

1741
01:37:51,081 --> 01:37:55,500
yourself into something so strong that 
you're actually just no longer afraid of

1742
01:37:55,501 --> 01:37:58,710
death and there's nothing false about 
that.

1743
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:02,310
See the backer and the Friday instinct,
that's impossible.

1744
01:38:02,430 --> 01:38:03,091
They think,
you know,

1745
01:38:03,091 --> 01:38:08,091
basically you're a,
you're a sand sculpture in a hurricane.

1746
01:38:11,950 --> 01:38:12,783
We don't know what people are and we 
don't know how tough they can be and 

1747
01:38:16,541 --> 01:38:19,270
people can be unbelievably tough.
You know what I mean?

1748
01:38:19,271 --> 01:38:20,104
You think about people for God's sake.
It's like my sister in law works in 

1749
01:38:23,261 --> 01:38:26,110
Palliative Care,
you know,

1750
01:38:26,170 --> 01:38:28,630
that's kind of rough.
Everybody she works with is gonna.

1751
01:38:28,631 --> 01:38:32,620
Like they're gonna die in three weeks.
She knows it.

1752
01:38:33,410 --> 01:38:35,550
She diluted about it,
you know,

1753
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:36,393
I don't think so.
I talked to her like she seems to be 

1754
01:38:38,231 --> 01:38:42,610
quite aware and also quite happy when 
her life is going well,

1755
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:44,620
you know,
because she sees all the time.

1756
01:38:44,621 --> 01:38:48,070
What happens if it doesn't go well?
It's like whole damn bottom falls out.

1757
01:38:48,130 --> 01:38:48,963
It's like if,
if you have a little joke that I was 

1758
01:38:51,401 --> 01:38:52,830
telling myself about,
this is like,

1759
01:38:52,900 --> 01:38:53,733
how can you tell when you're having a 
good day and answered that is there 

1760
01:38:56,291 --> 01:39:00,370
isn't a crocodile attached to your leg 
and that's about the right attitude.

1761
01:39:00,370 --> 01:39:01,203
And you know,
if you're dealing with something like 

1762
01:39:01,931 --> 01:39:02,764
palliative care,
that's basically how you think all the 

1763
01:39:04,211 --> 01:39:04,991
time.
Oh,

1764
01:39:04,991 --> 01:39:07,720
he had a rough day at school.
That's not so bad.

1765
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:09,970
At least there isn't a crocodile 
attached to your leg.

1766
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:11,273
You know?
And I also think that that's what 

1767
01:39:11,891 --> 01:39:12,724
happens to adolescents in cultures where
they undergo a really profound 

1768
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:18,910
initiation.
You know,

1769
01:39:19,270 --> 01:39:22,690
they're taken out of there.
It's usually happens with the boys.

1770
01:39:22,691 --> 01:39:23,524
And I think that's because mother nature
benefit blesses women with their own 

1771
01:39:26,650 --> 01:39:28,520
automatic initiation.
Um,

1772
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:30,453
they take the boys out from their 
mothers often their mothers are all 

1773
01:39:32,591 --> 01:39:33,424
crying and unhappy about this and some 
of that's ritual and some of it's true 

1774
01:39:35,981 --> 01:39:36,814
because they're going to lose their 
child and they take the kids out the 

1775
01:39:40,451 --> 01:39:42,970
boys out and they like,
they just scare them to death.

1776
01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:44,680
You know,
they burry them,

1777
01:39:44,681 --> 01:39:46,540
they put them in,
they put them in a cave.

1778
01:39:46,541 --> 01:39:48,610
I don't know if you've ever been in a 
cave with the lights off,

1779
01:39:48,611 --> 01:39:51,910
but I can tell you a cave is very dark 
and you can imagine.

1780
01:39:51,911 --> 01:39:55,090
Imagine sitting in a cave for two days.
Okay?

1781
01:39:55,091 --> 01:39:56,260
Now you might say,
well,

1782
01:39:56,261 --> 01:39:59,800
what's in that cave?
And the answer to that is who knows?

1783
01:39:59,801 --> 01:40:00,611
Right?
Spiders,

1784
01:40:00,611 --> 01:40:01,720
snakes,
whatever,

1785
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:03,400
cave monsters,
whatever.

1786
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:07,480
But I can tell you one thing that's in 
that cave and that's your imagination,

1787
01:40:08,890 --> 01:40:11,200
and believe me,
you're going to confront that sucker

1788
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:16,100
with two days inside a cave.
You're going to wonder,

1789
01:40:16,101 --> 01:40:18,770
well,
are they ever going to come back and get

1790
01:40:18,771 --> 01:40:20,930
me?
I'd be wondering that.

1791
01:40:21,050 --> 01:40:23,690
It's like,
what if the roof caves in?

1792
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:26,420
What if this is an evil trick?
And then you think,

1793
01:40:26,421 --> 01:40:26,960
well,
what are,

1794
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,030
what are all the things that could be in
that cave?

1795
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:31,880
Well,
whatever is really in that cave is,

1796
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:32,853
is certainly not going to be any more 
horrible than the things that you might 

1797
01:40:35,991 --> 01:40:38,870
imagine could be in that cave.
So you know,

1798
01:40:38,871 --> 01:40:39,704
in some sense and initiation like that 
is a confrontation with the ultimate 

1799
01:40:42,891 --> 01:40:47,600
horrific limits of imagination and my 
suspicion is if you get through that,

1800
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:48,903
I mean and there's more to the initial 
initiation ceremony then that because 

1801
01:40:51,441 --> 01:40:56,350
you also get inculcated with the tribes 
customs and beliefs at the same time,

1802
01:40:56,580 --> 01:40:58,990
you know,
so you're stripped bare in some sense in

1803
01:40:58,991 --> 01:40:59,824
that rebuilt as an adult.
I think part of what that initiation 

1804
01:41:03,671 --> 01:41:04,504
does is show you the difference between 
things you should be worried about and 

1805
01:41:07,151 --> 01:41:07,984
things you shouldn't be worried about.
And it isn't clear to me that you can 

1806
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:10,743
have your nervous system calibrated 
properly until you've taken yourself 

1807
01:41:14,410 --> 01:41:17,320
right to the edge because then you know

1808
01:41:19,870 --> 01:41:24,040
what's frightening and what isn't.
And there's every reason to believe that

1809
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:28,370
we have no idea how courageous people 
can be.

1810
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:29,713
You know,
they can be insanely ridiculously 

1811
01:41:31,521 --> 01:41:32,354
courageous.
And I think palliative care work is a 

1812
01:41:33,771 --> 01:41:35,480
good example of that,
you know,

1813
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:37,370
caring for the dying.
That's,

1814
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:39,493
you know,
I think that people who work in funeral 

1815
01:41:40,401 --> 01:41:41,690
homes are like that.
They,

1816
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:44,180
they seem to manage it.
You know,

1817
01:41:44,270 --> 01:41:45,103
I mean,
I've talked to people who work in 

1818
01:41:45,771 --> 01:41:46,521
funeral homes.
I said,

1819
01:41:46,521 --> 01:41:47,354
well,
like how the hell can you stand doing 

1820
01:41:48,711 --> 01:41:49,221
this?
They say,

1821
01:41:49,221 --> 01:41:50,054
well,
it really makes me appreciative of my 

1822
01:41:51,831 --> 01:41:54,530
life.
Isn't that interesting?

1823
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Like the things that shine forth can you
shine towards some reality shining forth

1824
01:42:05,860 --> 01:42:10,860
from the structure that kind of covers 
of reality.

1825
01:42:12,461 --> 01:42:15,610
So I kind of see that as like our social
work world.

1826
01:42:15,611 --> 01:42:20,611
Do you think humans can discern between 
kind of that shallow social,

1827
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:26,710
um,
social things that interest us from what

1828
01:42:26,830 --> 01:42:30,880
reality actually is?
Things that shine from reality?

1829
01:42:31,850 --> 01:42:32,411
Well,
you know what,

1830
01:42:32,411 --> 01:42:34,460
that diagram I showed you with the 
stacks,

1831
01:42:34,461 --> 01:42:37,220
there's a square,
it has a little dragon on it.

1832
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:38,980
Then there's a disc that's the great 
mother.

1833
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,980
Then there's another disc that's the 
great father,

1834
01:42:40,981 --> 01:42:43,490
and then there's a disk inside.
That's the hero.

1835
01:42:44,030 --> 01:42:45,140
Those are,
those are,

1836
01:42:45,200 --> 01:42:46,033
it's a map of the waste.
Things shine through fourth to some 

1837
01:42:48,531 --> 01:42:49,790
degree,
you know,

1838
01:42:49,850 --> 01:42:52,310
because I think the background is 
illuminated.

1839
01:42:52,311 --> 01:42:55,220
The background of things is illuminated,
so to speak.

1840
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:59,600
And then we place what is essentially a 
social structure on top of that.

1841
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,673
Part of that's conceptual and perceptual
and part of it's actually out in the 

1842
01:43:04,731 --> 01:43:05,630
world,
so you know,

1843
01:43:05,690 --> 01:43:07,880
when we're all sitting here just sitting
here,

1844
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:09,013
you know,
we're all keeping the tremendous 

1845
01:43:13,161 --> 01:43:16,250
potential that we all have for one thing
or another.

1846
01:43:16,251 --> 01:43:17,084
We're all keeping that under really 
tight control and we're all doing it in 

1847
01:43:19,011 --> 01:43:20,120
exactly the same way.

1848
01:43:20,150 --> 01:43:20,983
So basically the polite way to act in a 
situation like this is as if you're 

1849
01:43:25,790 --> 01:43:29,180
something that can be safely ignored.
Now the thing is,

1850
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:30,373
you have a map of the social world,
just like you have a map of the natural 

1851
01:43:32,961 --> 01:43:35,780
world,
there is the social world and you have a

1852
01:43:35,781 --> 01:43:39,530
map of it and there is the natural world
and you have a map in it of it.

1853
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:40,933
So the thing is,
novelty in the social world can also 

1854
01:43:43,941 --> 01:43:46,970
shine forth.
Now here's here are you out?

1855
01:43:47,030 --> 01:43:49,100
You see what you think about this?
So,

1856
01:43:50,450 --> 01:43:52,430
so let's say you fall in love with 
someone,

1857
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:54,873
okay?
And you think the clearly that's a 

1858
01:43:56,331 --> 01:44:00,800
delusional state because while it fades 
usually,

1859
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:02,960
and uh,
you know,

1860
01:44:02,961 --> 01:44:04,940
often what happens in a relationship,
is that,

1861
01:44:04,941 --> 01:44:05,774
right?

1862
01:44:06,430 --> 01:44:07,263
The person who sort of illuminated that,
that would be the effect they have on 

1863
01:44:10,991 --> 01:44:14,810
you when you're infatuated or when 
you're in love and then you know,

1864
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:15,763
you learn all the ways that they don't 
quite match that maybe or you habituate 

1865
01:44:19,271 --> 01:44:20,104
to them or you know,
the relationship accumulates a 

1866
01:44:22,361 --> 01:44:26,050
tremendous number of errors and then 
that disappears and you think,

1867
01:44:26,051 --> 01:44:29,020
well that was just like,
that's an instinct and you're the victim

1868
01:44:29,021 --> 01:44:31,090
of it.
You have to fall in love like that.

1869
01:44:31,091 --> 01:44:31,924
You have to be stupid like that because 
otherwise men and women wouldn't be 

1870
01:44:34,391 --> 01:44:36,130
attracted to each other.
And that would be the end of it,

1871
01:44:36,131 --> 01:44:37,750
but it.
But it's an illusion.

1872
01:44:37,751 --> 01:44:39,700
Maybe it's a chemically induced 
delusion.

1873
01:44:40,330 --> 01:44:41,710
Okay,
that's one way of looking at it.

1874
01:44:41,711 --> 01:44:45,340
But here's another way of looking at it.
Now I'm going to switch it a little bit.

1875
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:50,650
It's one thing your,
the women in the class will particularly

1876
01:44:50,710 --> 01:44:52,900
experienced this,
although men can experience it too,

1877
01:44:52,901 --> 01:44:55,780
but I think it's something that's 
particularly granted to women.

1878
01:44:56,470 --> 01:44:59,230
So let's say you see someone else's 
baby.

1879
01:44:59,890 --> 01:45:00,723
Okay,
well most women and some men are quite 

1880
01:45:03,131 --> 01:45:04,360
interested in babies.
You know,

1881
01:45:04,361 --> 01:45:06,130
so they'll go up,
they like to interact with them,

1882
01:45:06,180 --> 01:45:07,990
they're,
they're attracted to baby so,

1883
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:09,333
but being attracted to someone else's 
baby is nothing like seeing your own 

1884
01:45:13,361 --> 01:45:14,194
baby.
Like those are like those are 

1885
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:16,533
cataclysmically different experiences 
and I think the reason for that is the 

1886
01:45:20,471 --> 01:45:22,900
only baby you can actually see as your 
own

1887
01:45:25,230 --> 01:45:26,063
for everyone else's baby.
You just see your representation of a 

1888
01:45:27,931 --> 01:45:30,690
baby and the real baby shines through a 
little bit but not very much.

1889
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:33,360
But what you're blessed with,
if you have a child,

1890
01:45:33,361 --> 01:45:34,194
and I think this probably is a 
consequence of a biochemical 

1891
01:45:36,031 --> 01:45:36,864
transformation,
is that the memory structures that you 

1892
01:45:39,931 --> 01:45:40,764
would use to process that child as a 
known object disappear and all you see 

1893
01:45:45,571 --> 01:45:46,404
is the baby.
It's like that's the same idea as the 

1894
01:45:48,241 --> 01:45:49,590
archetypal infant.
You know,

1895
01:45:49,591 --> 01:45:52,140
the architectural holy child,
you know,

1896
01:45:52,141 --> 01:45:56,460
and it's certainly possible that each 
infant is an architecturally holy child,

1897
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:58,590
but the only person that can see that is
the mother.

1898
01:45:59,040 --> 01:45:59,821
And then you might say,
well,

1899
01:45:59,821 --> 01:46:03,390
is that true?
Is that an architect holy child?

1900
01:46:03,810 --> 01:46:04,643
Well,
one answer that might be it depends on 

1901
01:46:05,911 --> 01:46:07,960
how you treat it,
you know,

1902
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,860
if you treat it as if it's an 
architecturally holy child,

1903
01:46:11,010 --> 01:46:13,320
then it has a pretty good chance of 
developing into one

1904
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:16,730
so and so.
Then let's,

1905
01:46:17,290 --> 01:46:18,123
let's switch that a bit and think about 
a relationship that you would have with 

1906
01:46:20,181 --> 01:46:23,960
someone when you fall in love.
One possibility is that you're diluted.

1907
01:46:24,110 --> 01:46:24,943
The other possibility is you get the 
chance briefly to see what that person 

1908
01:46:28,281 --> 01:46:33,281
could be like if you interacted with 
them in the most perfect way you could,

1909
01:46:34,130 --> 01:46:34,963
so it's like a glimpse.
It's like a glimpse into a potential 

1910
01:46:39,890 --> 01:46:40,723
extraordinarily positive future,
so they visioned emerges and then it 

1911
01:46:46,521 --> 01:46:49,860
shuts,
and then it's up to you to build it,

1912
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:53,370
to make it happen,
to take what you've seen in transform it

1913
01:46:53,371 --> 01:46:56,970
into reality.
Now that doesn't mean I don't think that

1914
01:46:56,971 --> 01:46:58,590
people can be diluted about

1915
01:46:59,890 --> 01:47:00,723
their partner.
I think they're diluted about their 

1916
01:47:01,541 --> 01:47:02,374
partners all the time.
I think part of the reason for that is 

1917
01:47:04,691 --> 01:47:09,691
that we build corrupt maps and we do it 
on purpose and to the degree that you've

1918
01:47:11,311 --> 01:47:12,144
built a corrupt map,
then the things that shine forth aren't 

1919
01:47:14,921 --> 01:47:18,910
even going to be in the right place.
So one of the corollaries,

1920
01:47:18,911 --> 01:47:21,160
and we're going to talk about this a lot
near the end of the class,

1921
01:47:21,161 --> 01:47:24,550
that is if you're going to follow the 
things that shine forth,

1922
01:47:24,790 --> 01:47:25,623
you better make sure you're not looking 
at the world with flawed machinery 

1923
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:32,680
because my suspicions are that for 
someone like Jeffrey Dahmer,

1924
01:47:32,681 --> 01:47:35,470
for example,
the things that Sean fourth,

1925
01:47:35,710 --> 01:47:38,200
we're not exactly the things that you 
would like to follow.

1926
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:41,140
You know who Jeffrey Dahmer was?
Oh,

1927
01:47:41,650 --> 01:47:45,780
he was a brutal serial murderer.
Yeah.

1928
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:46,680
Yeah.
He was.

1929
01:47:46,830 --> 01:47:47,663
And you know,
in in many situations like that when 

1930
01:47:49,951 --> 01:47:53,010
someone is oriented towards 
extraordinarily brutal crimes,

1931
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:55,860
the brutality of the crime increases 
with time.

1932
01:47:55,950 --> 01:47:58,410
The brutality of the crime increases.
It starts with.

1933
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:02,790
It often starts with the torture of 
animals and then it proceeds and there's

1934
01:48:02,791 --> 01:48:03,624
no stopping it.
Like God only knows where it would go 

1935
01:48:05,940 --> 01:48:07,350
and I mean it.
It's bad enough.

1936
01:48:07,351 --> 01:48:10,200
So one character like that,
John Wayne Gacy,

1937
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:11,393
he was a clown.
He was quite the character when they 

1938
01:48:14,041 --> 01:48:16,530
finally caught him,
he asked to be killed.

1939
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,560
So you know,
the shine forth thing,

1940
01:48:19,561 --> 01:48:23,400
is it kind of a tricky business because 
you know,

1941
01:48:23,401 --> 01:48:24,234
there's a line in the old testament or 
the new testament that says something 

1942
01:48:26,491 --> 01:48:27,324
like,
test the spirits to be sure to be 

1943
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:32,310
certain that they are from God.
It's something like that.

1944
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:34,650
But you know,
if you're looking at things in a crooked

1945
01:48:34,651 --> 01:48:37,290
way,
what shines forth might not be the thing

1946
01:48:37,291 --> 01:48:38,124
that's best for you.
So there's this like there's this 

1947
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:40,853
parallelism.
So if you're going to take the risk of 

1948
01:48:43,201 --> 01:48:45,120
having a life that's governed by 
meaning,

1949
01:48:45,121 --> 01:48:45,954
let's say you bloody well better,
make sure that you're not lying to 

1950
01:48:48,181 --> 01:48:49,014
yourself because all that will happen 
then is that you'll follow a blind 

1951
01:48:52,021 --> 01:48:54,900
person and you'll both fall into a pit.
Okay?

1952
01:48:54,901 --> 01:48:55,950
So let's take a break.
