30
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:41,304
in Switzerland and in California and in 
Australia and New Zealand and that 

31
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:48,990
should uh,
do quite nicely for January and February

32
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:52,260
and also get my wife and I out of the 
cold weather.

33
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,210
So that'll be good.
So,

34
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:56,040
um,
I hope to see you there.

35
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,550
