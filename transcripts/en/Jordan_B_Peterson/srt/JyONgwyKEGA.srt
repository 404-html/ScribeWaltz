1
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:17,143
So I'm talking today with Nina Paley,
who's a brilliant animator and she's 

2
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,583
making a variety of short films,
which I guess are going to be joined 

3
00:00:27,351 --> 00:00:31,580
together into a longer film about that 
feature,

4
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:32,414
old testament themes,
and she's the creator of the animated 

5
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:37,940
musical features.
Sita sings the blues,

6
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,970
her adventures in our broken copyright 
system,

7
00:00:40,971 --> 00:00:44,930
let her to join question,
copyright.org as artists in residence in

8
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:45,764
2008 where she produced a series of 
animated shorts about intellectual 

9
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:54,371
freedom called minute means or recently 
she made this land is mine,

10
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,460
which is absolutely brilliant,
shocking,

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
a devastating and also aesthetically 
impressive film about Israel Palestine,

12
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,000
Canaan,
the Levant,

13
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,930
and that's intended for her new feature 
film sadomasochism.

14
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:17,470
And you can find a lot of Nina's pieces 
of pieces of that film online.

15
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,400
And I would highly recommend watching 
the wheel,

16
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:26,030
a couple of them into this interview so 
that you can see what she's up to.

17
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:29,000
So I guess there's two things that we 
could really talk about.

18
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,350
I think that most important one 
obviously is your work,

19
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:34,184
but I guess the second one is your 
concern for intellectual freedom and 

20
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,690
your feeling with regards to two 
copyrights.

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,520
Copying is not stealing and less less 
copying.

22
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,323
It makes one thing.
That's what toppings for copying is not 

23
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,750
the
one for me and one for you.

24
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:11,150
That's what God is doing.
There's one for each of us.

25
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:27,030
That is what we call copy sharing ideas 
with everyone.

26
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,960
That's why it caught me,

27
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,150
but let's,
let's start.

28
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,190
Let's start by talking about you first 
tell,

29
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,093
tell my listeners and tell me who you 
are and where you come from and what 

30
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:44,794
you're about.

31
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,190
You want to know about my identity.
I guess that's,

32
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:50,020
that's.
Yeah,

33
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,460
trust me to identify myself.
I don't trust myself there.

34
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,280
Well that's okay.
You're the best source we have today.

35
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,900
Actually.
I'm not,

36
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,550
am not sure about that.
Um,

37
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:03,903
I mean,
I think most of us would agree that I'm 

38
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:06,154
an artist and currently an animator.
I guess I've been doing animation since 

39
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,400
1998.
Uh,

40
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,470
before that I was a newspaper cartoonist
is still do comics from time to time.

41
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:23,810
Not very often,
I mean,

42
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,283
I guess the thing is I've just been,
I just came back from a bike ride and 

43
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:27,963
I've just been thinking about identity 
like all the time and how incredibly 

44
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,860
unreliable it is and how I don't respect
it,

45
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:35,410
including ways that I identify myself.

46
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,740
Well I guess that's part of being an 
artist,

47
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:38,574
you know,
because people who are artistic or high 

48
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,350
in trait openness and that gives them a 
very fluid identity.

49
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,313
I mean it's an advantage because people 
who are high in openness can think 

50
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:50,850
loudly and they're always coming up with
creative ideas,

51
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:51,684
but it does tend to make their identity 
rather pluralistic and sometimes 

52
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:58,650
unstable.
And that could also be a problem.

53
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,063
Well,
I guess I guess it's not even that it's 

54
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:01,900
fluid.
It's not like,

55
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,300
oh,
I identify this way one day and this way

56
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,290
another day.
It's just,

57
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,680
I don't really currently have much 
respect for the idea of identity at all.

58
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,303
Uh,
and I could say all kinds of things 

59
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:17,320
about myself,
but you know,

60
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,940
does that actually do me any good?

61
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,383
Well,
let me ask you a couple of basic 

62
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:23,060
questions.
Where do you live?

63
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,930
I live in Urbana,
Illinois.

64
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,610
That's verifiable.
Alright,

65
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,510
and where were you born?
I was born in her band.

66
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,140
So you've been there your whole life 
essentially?

67
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,420
No,
I left when I was 20.

68
00:04:35,421 --> 00:04:38,540
I moved to Santa Cruz,
California and I wanted to be a hippie.

69
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,680
I failed a.
But then you know,

70
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,810
I was already out on my own.
So I briefly moved to Austin,

71
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:46,490
Texas.
That didn't work out.

72
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,230
I moved to San Francisco in 1991.
I lived there for 11 years.

73
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,590
In 2002 I had followed my then 
boyfriend.

74
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:57,770
Actually we were legally married,
so my then husband to India,

75
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,140
uh,
which is the subject,

76
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,300
one of the subjects of Sita sings the 
blues.

77
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,930
And then later in 2002 I moved to 
Brooklyn,

78
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:10,340
New York and lived in various places in 
New York for a total of about 10 years.

79
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,840
I moved back to her Urbana in 2012 right
after my father died.

80
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,160
And here I am.

81
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,780
And so why did you move back to her band
and after all that adventuring?

82
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,920
First I was done with New York.
Even though I really love New York,

83
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,100
especially know my first five years 
there,

84
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:28,934
I was fantastic.
I kind of achieved more than I even 

85
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:34,604
expected I would be able to and started 
to just get the love affair with New 

86
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,720
York kind of wore off and I wanted a 
little more peace and quiet and I wanted

87
00:05:47,451 --> 00:05:50,690
cooler summers and I didn't want to 
smell garbage everywhere all the time.

88
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,423
Uh,
I had an opportunity to move back here 

89
00:05:53,841 --> 00:05:54,674
because my dad died.
My mom was threatening to sell the 

90
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:00,200
house.
I joined the occupy movement,

91
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,213
occupy moms house,
trying to keep her from selling that 

92
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,003
house.

93
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,510
You actually had a specific demand with 
your occupied movement.

94
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,850
Failed.
She sold the house anyway,

95
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,370
but I think in our new house,
yeah,

96
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,373
I was,
I was dating somebody that lived here 

97
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,610
and uh,
that has ended,

98
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,640
but I actually really like it.
It's much more relaxed and inexpensive.

99
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:29,534
I get lots of fresh air.
I take lots of bike rides and I don't 

100
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:34,430
really care about,
uh,

101
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,780
the less stressed out
identity less.

102
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,060
Yes.
Well you have plenty of adventure,

103
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:45,600
so obviously.
So I guess it must take a fair bit of,

104
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,950
I would think time of quiet and,
and,

105
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,440
and some isolation in order to work on 
your animation.

106
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,133
Yeah,
well I achieved that quite an isolation 

107
00:06:55,881 --> 00:07:00,500
in New York actually by just living in 
New York in an apartment by myself.

108
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,633
I would rather live in New York than 
visit New York because when you live 

109
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,024
there you can actually control your 
environment somewhat and you can shut 

110
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:09,404
everything out.
Whereas when you're visiting usually 

111
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:13,610
have to be out all the time being 
overstimulated.

112
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,301
Rick.
Yes.

113
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,490
Well it's definitely an overstimulating 
place.

114
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,360
So you.
When did you start doing your animation?

115
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,213
I started animating as an adult in 1998.
Before that I had done some animation 

116
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:32,531
when I was 13 years old using a borrowed
super eight camera and I just completely

117
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:35,234
stopped because I was in central 
Illinois and there was no support for 

118
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,753
doing animation.
There was no way I could have advanced 

119
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:46,300
beyond the neighbor super eight camera.
Uh,

120
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,293
but then in 1998 I was burning out of my
daily comic strip and wanted to do 

121
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:53,984
something and borrowed somebody else's 
super eight camera and in 1998 it was 

122
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,784
easier to advance,
especially in San Francisco where a lot 

123
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:05,270
of people were doing independent film 
and yeah,

124
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:06,104
I just picked up where I left off.
I did plasticine clay stuff on super 

125
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:10,784
eight and shared that film with a band 
called Nick Phelps in the sprocket 

126
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:19,550
ensemble that did live music to 
animation and that was really fun.

127
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:20,384
I was being gratified by audience 
feedback and so I made another film on 

128
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,910
16 millimeter and then my next film was 
drawing and scratching on 35 millimeter.

129
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:33,911
And then my next film after that was 
drawing and scratching on Imax film,

130
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:37,100
which is 70 millimeter.
Really big frames.

131
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,503
And then I got into flash,
macromedia flash and I've been digital 

132
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:43,964
ever since.

133
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,630
Are you using macromedia flash now?
What's your primary technology?

134
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,240
A lot of those clips for sadomasochism 
more animated in macromedia flash,

135
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,433
adobe flash and crippled it and ruined 
it in the opinion of many flash 

136
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:02,850
animators.
So I'm still using macromedia flash from

137
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:07,851
1990 2007.
Is that when my copy of flashes from,

138
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,390
I don't know,
macromedia flash eight.

139
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:14,040
It only runs on older computers actually
I think it might be from 2006 or 2005.

140
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,413
So I have this old Mac here,
a running ios 10 point six because it 

141
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:24,600
won't run on any more recent machines 
and uh,

142
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,520
you know,
it's like impossible to integrate with a

143
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,760
modern video editing system.
So I have a new Mac as well.

144
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,240
And the newer parts though Sadomasochism
I'm using a program called Moho pro 12,

145
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,180
which is kept up and runs on modern 
computers.

146
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,473
Yeah,
it's funny how sometimes software peaks 

147
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:51,400
in terms of complexity and usability and
then it goes downhill,

148
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,123
you know,
I think we're seeing that not just with 

149
00:09:54,251 --> 00:09:55,084
software but with computers altogether,
like personal computers I think peaked 

150
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,843
around 2007,
maybe 2010 and they've been getting 

151
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:04,444
worse ever since.
Like any sort of upgrade to operating 

152
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:10,900
systems just means more surveillance and
less user freedom at this point.

153
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,780
Yes.
As well as the steep learning curve.

154
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,933
What annoying.
If you happen to be an expert with the 

155
00:10:17,141 --> 00:10:18,040
previous system,

156
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,481
yeah.
Anyway,

157
00:10:19,481 --> 00:10:22,120
I don't know if I don't know if I can 
keep animating digitally,

158
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,470
uh,
because it,

159
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,453
you know,
like the software that I'm using now 

160
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:26,104
motto,
I just found out that the person that 

161
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,503
created it and was an integral part of 
it's team this whole time just left the 

162
00:10:32,951 --> 00:10:33,940
company.
So,

163
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,560
uh,
you know,

164
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,900
we'll host faith is unclear and I'm 
like,

165
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:42,340
if I have to learn a whole other piece 
of software again,

166
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,260
I just don't know if I can take this 
anymore.

167
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,030
I mean,
I'm so fluent with flash.

168
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:48,070
It took me years to become fluent at 
all.

169
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,953
Whoa.
Whoa.

170
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,183
Yeah.
Well that's another thing is that it 

171
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,293
takes a long time to become an expert 
user of a complex software program and 

172
00:10:55,361 --> 00:10:58,090
then when it shifts the ground shifts 
from underneath you,

173
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:58,924
it's rather disheartening because all of
that expertise is essentially 

174
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:03,424
disappears.
And I guess it's part of what we're 

175
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:05,974
experiencing as our technology advances 
fast enough so that our lifespans are 

176
00:11:10,031 --> 00:11:12,010
too long really to keep up.
You know,

177
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,933
we get,
we get outdated and superannuated on 

178
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:19,450
about a five year rotation and it does 
get exhausting.

179
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,100
Yeah.
Well maybe I'll just die early.

180
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,600
Won't have to worry about that.
That'll solve the problem.

181
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,950
Then you won't feel finished your film.
And now it seems like a bad idea.

182
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,570
Well,
I'm going to finish this film.

183
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:33,810
I finally see the light at the end of 
the tunnel for sadomasochism.

184
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,880
Good for you.
So,

185
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:37,100
so let,
let me ask you something about that.

186
00:11:37,101 --> 00:11:39,950
So now you made this land is mine.
When was that?

187
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,340
That was in 2012 I think it was.
That's the first scene that I made.

188
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,990
God gave this
to me.

189
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,660
I
see.

190
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,680
So it's going to be the last scene in 
the film,

191
00:15:02,681 --> 00:15:03,940
but it's the first one that I made.

192
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,250
I see.
And what,

193
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,470
what possessed you to make that?

194
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,413
So I knew I wanted to make a movie about
Passover because I was ready to just 

195
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,480
observing Passover,
although not much else.

196
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,350
And so I was doing research.
I'd never seen the movie exodus,

197
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,613
you know,
that movie.

198
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,053
I'd never seen it.
So I watched it as part of my research 

199
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:26,843
and I learned that the theme music had 
lyrics written to it by Pat Boone and 

200
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:34,830
that it was a really popular song in the
sixties.

201
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,680
Tons of artists did it.
I'd never even heard it before.

202
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,260
So I heard it and I just thought it was 
ridiculous.

203
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,610
Right?
This land is mine.

204
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:43,410
God gave this land to me.
I mean,

205
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,360
any.
Everyone would say that,

206
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,410
right?
Everybody,

207
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:49,170
every group feels that way about the 
land that they're on,

208
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,630
every single one.
So the absurdity of it was just apparent

209
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,473
in the song and no,
there wasn't even really a process of 

210
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,913
coming up with a concept for it.
It was just that was what the song 

211
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,853
evoked for me.
It was just showing how every single 

212
00:16:06,511 --> 00:16:08,200
person,
or not every single person,

213
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:12,750
but every single tribe has that attitude
towards their land.

214
00:16:12,751 --> 00:16:16,530
And so saying that this land is yours 
and God gave this land to me,

215
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:21,460
gives you no authority at all because
every.

216
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:25,410
I mean that's just what it is to be a 
tribe living on land.

217
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,273
So what's,
what sort of reaction did you garner 

218
00:16:30,011 --> 00:16:31,840
from this land is mine,

219
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:36,220
this land is mine is the most popular 
thing I have ever made.

220
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:39,820
It's been viewed on various channels 
more than 10 million times.

221
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,340
Uh,
and you know,

222
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,270
many people like it in terms of 
criticism,

223
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,133
the criticism seems equally divided 
between people that say that I'm a 

224
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:54,100
Zionist and people that say I'm an anti 
Zionist,

225
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:58,180
so it's either a really anti Zionist 
film or it's a really Zionist film.

226
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,273
I see.
So you can just add that criticism 

227
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:02,670
together in sum to zero and ignore it.

228
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,910
Yeah.
Well,

229
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,930
I'm really flattered by it,
right?

230
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:08,810
Because if people that passionately,
you know,

231
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,140
I'm on polar opposite sides are saying 
that,

232
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:16,310
then I feel like I've really done 
something.

233
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:17,120
Right.

234
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,710
Well,
you've definitely done something right.

235
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:21,320
I mean,
I think that was the first film of yours

236
00:17:21,321 --> 00:17:23,210
that I saw and then I've watched many of
them.

237
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:24,044
I think everyone I could get my hands on
since then and instruct me in a variety 

238
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:28,490
of ways.
I mean,

239
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,323
the first thing that's,
let's say strange about your animation 

240
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:35,900
is that it's this.
If first of all,

241
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:37,520
you have great taste,
didn't use it,

242
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,350
I'll get the best.
And how do you get permission?

243
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,820
How do you be done to?
Good.

244
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,013
Oh,
you're doing.

245
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,460
I don't really,
really.

246
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,700
How's that working out for you?
Well,

247
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:52,640
okay.
In the case of this land is mine.

248
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,120
It's pretty clear cut,
fair use because the film is parody,

249
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:57,983
like I said it,
it's literally a parody of those lyrics 

250
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:05,160
and you know,
that's fair use.

251
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,490
Uh,
I,

252
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,590
I actually think most of my uses are 
fair use,

253
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:11,424
their transformative,
but a lot of uses are not as clear cut 

254
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:16,134
as parody.
So that's actually a really interesting 

255
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,703
issue with the film and how is this film
going to be released and how's it going 

256
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:24,264
to be shown because there is no,
no way I am going to ask for permission 

257
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,813
to use this music,
particularly music that entered my head 

258
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:35,010
as a child,
uh,

259
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,190
which I did not consent to and I had no 
control over it.

260
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,250
Of course nobody has any control over 
what goes into your head,

261
00:18:41,251 --> 00:18:43,230
right?
Like you'd go out in the world and music

262
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:44,850
is playing,
it goes into your head,

263
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,920
uh,
and yet once it's there,

264
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,520
that part of your head that it occupies 
belongs to a corporation.

265
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,240
And I'm just done asking corporations 
for permission to use what's in my head,

266
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,430
which they put there.
Okay.

267
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,430
So you basically solve the problem by 
saying to hell with it,

268
00:19:02,431 --> 00:19:05,760
I'm going to do this,
I'm going to do this no matter what.

269
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,153
And you're going to hire note whatever 
difficulties there are with that as you 

270
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:12,210
move along.
It's an illegal film.

271
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,640
I mean,
in the case of Sita sings the blues,

272
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,433
I Made Sita sings the blues when I was,
I was certainly questioning in 

273
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:20,334
copyright,
but I didn't really see it as a 

274
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:27,111
completely bankrupt institution.
So when that film was done,

275
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,183
I cleared all the rights,
which was an incredibly difficult 

276
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:33,234
process and required hiring 
intermediaries because the rights 

277
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:38,640
holders don't talk to normal people.

278
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,500
So if you do make a film and you don't 
have permission to use the music in it,

279
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:46,320
you can't simply ask for permission.
They won't talk to you.

280
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,230
So you have to pay lawyers.
And intermediaries,

281
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,363
just for them to even listen to you to 
tell you how much money they're 

282
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:53,664
demanding,
which is inevitably an absurd amount 

283
00:19:54,871 --> 00:19:55,704
that you can't afford.
But I ended up spending a mere $70,000 

284
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,583
to make sita sings the blues legal to 
show for free and legal to share for 

285
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:08,850
free.
If I wanted some other model,

286
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:13,851
it would have been more than that 
$70,000 to be able to give it away.

287
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,780
Uh,
but I'm not doing that with a new film.

288
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:20,940
The new film,
I'm making an illegal film.

289
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,390
All of my music choices have to do not 
with their licenses,

290
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:29,010
but with the content and meaning and 
resonance of the songs.

291
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,293
Most songs have a kind of cultural 
resonance that is related to the point 

292
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:39,021
in time they were circulating.
For example,

293
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,960
this land is mine,
you know,

294
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,770
refers directly to this period of the 
sixties.

295
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,643
Yeah.
It has a cultural resonance because of 

296
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:47,410
that.
Which a new song.

297
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:50,410
If I commissioned a new song,
sort of like that,

298
00:20:50,411 --> 00:20:52,210
it wouldn't have the same meaning at 
all.

299
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,390
No,
definitely no.

300
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,363
Songs like that they pick up.
It's really interesting to watch what 

301
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,880
happens to a song across time because it
picks up again,

302
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,853
it's embedded in the context and that 
context grows and develops and 

303
00:21:03,381 --> 00:21:06,740
transforms.
The song is really a mutable entity.

304
00:21:06,741 --> 00:21:07,820
You know,
it,

305
00:21:07,821 --> 00:21:10,700
it transforms tremendously as it moves 
across time.

306
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,933
Yeah.
And that.

307
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,950
And that meaning comes from the 
audience.

308
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,920
It doesn't come from even the person 
that wrote it,

309
00:21:16,921 --> 00:21:18,780
let alone the copyright holder.
Right.

310
00:21:18,781 --> 00:21:21,330
The value of it comes from us.

311
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,110
Okay.
So back to this land is mine.

312
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:26,410
So when I watched that,
it produced a lot of mixed feelings.

313
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:31,411
I mean the first was that it was very 
blackly humorous and you know,

314
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:38,410
you have this stirring propaganda stick 
anthem,

315
00:21:38,411 --> 00:21:42,100
light music in the background.
It's sort of overblown.

316
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,090
I'm the singer,
he,

317
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,283
he,
he amplifies the emotional resonance of 

318
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:52,561
it and then you have this just nonstop 
carnage in the background to this,

319
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:54,843
to this stirring music and then.
But what's really strange about it as 

320
00:21:58,031 --> 00:21:58,864
far as I was concerned is that it's 
eerily beautiful and that's something 

321
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:05,860
that's,
it seems to be a perverse and remarkable

322
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:06,694
element of all of your films is that 
they deal with extremely harsh 

323
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,390
realities,
metaphysical and,

324
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,433
and genuine,
but you have this amazing capacity to 

325
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,930
generate these complex,
beautiful images and to set them in a,

326
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,183
in a,
in an equally beautiful relationship to 

327
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:27,970
the music.
And so,

328
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,673
I mean,
I didn't know and still don't know what 

329
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,084
to make of the film because you don't 
often see what you might describe as 

330
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,000
stunningly beautiful satire,
stunningly beautiful artistic satire.

331
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,633
I don't know.
Mad magazine was pretty stunningly 

332
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:51,560
beautiful
back back in the day.

333
00:22:51,561 --> 00:22:53,860
It hadn't had like the best artists 
working for it.

334
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,560
Yeah,
that's true.

335
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,910
That's true.
But you're,

336
00:22:56,911 --> 00:22:59,400
you're,
there's an element to what you're doing,

337
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:02,620
especially with the juxtaposition of the
music that seems to elevate it,

338
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,520
in my opinion,
to something like the level of high art.

339
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:07,980
What's high?
What's low?

340
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:08,581
Well,
thank you.

341
00:23:08,581 --> 00:23:11,340
I thank you for the compliment.
I can't really respond to any,

342
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,960
anything other than thanking you.

343
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:18,580
So your aesthetic sense and the style 
that you've developed,

344
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,700
do you have sources for that?
Do you have influences that,

345
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,020
that,
that helped you,

346
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:27,680
helped you develop that particular 
style?

347
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,110
I mean,
I know it's a foolish question,

348
00:23:30,111 --> 00:23:31,970
dial star artists where they get their 
ideas,

349
00:23:31,971 --> 00:23:35,300
but I'm,
I'm wondering how it is that you came up

350
00:23:35,301 --> 00:23:37,340
with the concepts that you're working 
with?

351
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,570
Well,
graphically,

352
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,200
some of the style is determined by the 
software that I use.

353
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:48,650
So this land is mine and all the song 
scenes and Sadomasochism,

354
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:51,230
arch,
flash and flash.

355
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,050
The way I use it,
it's what we call a cutout style.

356
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,183
We're all drawing shapes and I'll,
I'll move them in relation to each 

357
00:23:58,191 --> 00:23:59,024
other,
but the ships themselves don't bend or 

358
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:02,474
anything they're just cut out is an 
animation technique where people would 

359
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:11,441
literally cut out shapes from paper and 
move them around under a camera.

360
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,980
So that's part of the style,
uh,

361
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,013
with this land is mine in particular I 
was looking at ancient Assyrian art and 

362
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:23,000
ancient Egyptian art.
Some of that is reflected.

363
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:27,590
There's like little border of flowers 
which comes from a Syrian art.

364
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,560
Um,

365
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,320
those are the main things,
a cutout style and this Syria and stuff.

366
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,163
And

367
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,780
when you,
when you made this way or this morning,

368
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:45,710
did you have the sadomasochism film in 
mind or did that emerge afterwards?

369
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,480
No,
I knew,

370
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:52,460
I knew I wanted to make this film about 
Passover and that's why I watched exodus

371
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,480
and that's how sadomasochism,
I mean that's how this land is.

372
00:24:56,481 --> 00:24:57,314
Mine came to be.
So I just knew I wanted to do a film 

373
00:24:59,391 --> 00:25:00,224
about Passover.
I didn't know what it was gonna be 

374
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:04,390
because I had never read the Old 
Testament before.

375
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,060
And reading exodus was of course an eye 
opener.

376
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,030
Um,
and the film,

377
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,300
I don't,
I didn't imagine what the film was gonna

378
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,040
be like when I started it other than the
topic I would work around.

379
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:19,850
But the way the film is actually shaping
up is a surprise to me.

380
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:25,670
So we should probably walk everyone 
who's listening through the film itself.

381
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:30,671
So you've created a variety of what 
appear at least to be at the moment,

382
00:25:31,011 --> 00:25:31,844
to be animated shorts that detail out 
different episodes in the biblical 

383
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:38,570
narrative surrounding essentially 
surrounding Moses.

384
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:39,404
There's more to it than that,
but certainly surrounding Moses and so 

385
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,423
does the film,
does the film essentially concentrate 

386
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,430
solely on exodus or are there other 
elements of,

387
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,770
of Old Testament stories that are you 
that you're including?

388
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,353
It's really just exodus,
leviticus and deuteronomy and numbers 

389
00:26:01,131 --> 00:26:04,110
all have bits of exodus in them.

390
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,840
Right?
Right.

391
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,760
So it's basically the story of Moses.

392
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,070
It's a story of Moses,
right?

393
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,080
It's the story of the exodus and then be
establishment of the,

394
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,813
you know,
the Tabernacle and the priesthood and 

395
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:18,850
the religion.
Right.

396
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:22,720
That's sort of a mean.
It's regarded as the birth of the Jewish

397
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,583
people.

398
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,510
Right.
Right.

399
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,430
And so now you said that when you were 
growing up,

400
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:31,790
you observed Passover but not much else.
Yeah.

401
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,740
So,
but you're,

402
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:37,790
it's not unreasonable,
I think to observe that there appears to

403
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:40,760
be something like a deep religious 
sensibility in your,

404
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,990
in your work.
I mean,

405
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:44,040
you seem to be treating the stories with

406
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,810
a tremendous amount of respect.
And so what,

407
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,523
what do you,
what do you think's welling up from 

408
00:26:50,641 --> 00:26:53,540
inside of you to do that?
Well,

409
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,790
I'm glad you recognize the risk and the 
respect.

410
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,023
Any respect for this was like I,
I approached these stories with an open 

411
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:08,301
mind and an open heart and was expecting
to find some wisdom in them.

412
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,833
Uh,
when I began this project I thought I'm 

413
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,550
going to explore the religion of my 
father.

414
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,030
My father came from a religious Jewish 
family,

415
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,280
but he wasn't really religious when I 
was growing up.

416
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,310
Although he had,
he,

417
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:34,370
he wanted us to observe Passover.
I guess as part of our,

418
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,263
he want us to have some Jewish identity.
He wanted us to be in touch with our 

419
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:45,321
heritage as Jews,
but it was a bit muddled.

420
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,220
Um,
like we,

421
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,890
we were forbidden from observing any 
Christian holidays.

422
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,880
There was no Christmas in our house,
whereas a lot of secular Jews do observe

423
00:27:56,881 --> 00:27:57,714
Christmas.
There was like a really half assed 

424
00:27:59,241 --> 00:28:02,730
Hanukkah and there were no other high 
holy days.

425
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,623
And my dad was an atheist.
So after spending years reading many 

426
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,653
different versions of exodus and 
commentary on it and things relating to 

427
00:28:18,481 --> 00:28:19,314
it and trying to understand it and 
trying to find some way to connect to 

428
00:28:23,191 --> 00:28:24,024
it.

429
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,680
What happened was I realized that I had 
found the religion of my father and that

430
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:32,370
was atheism.
So I,

431
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:37,300
I became sort of a born again,
atheist reading this stuff.

432
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,163
My neutrality towards the religion 
changed to a kind of a boring towards 

433
00:28:44,501 --> 00:28:45,740
it,
um,

434
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,510
which is,
which is not to take away from.

435
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,400
It's important,
you know,

436
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,970
as a cultural foundation,
right?

437
00:28:52,971 --> 00:28:53,804
Like I live in western culture and these
texts are stories that everybody knows 

438
00:28:59,421 --> 00:29:03,880
to some extent and you know,
they're very important and I,

439
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:04,723
I respect them for that reason that 
there were like a cultural touchstone 

440
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:12,580
for everyone.
But I did not emerge from exodus within,

441
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:17,120
you know,
I had like less connection to God than I

442
00:29:17,121 --> 00:29:20,510
had ever had in my life.
I actually had like a spiritual crisis,

443
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:22,070
like,
you know,

444
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,323
it was really hard for me to have any 
kind of sense of a power greater than 

445
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:30,950
myself after reading this and,
and working with it.

446
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,300
And that's also been the case as a 
consequence of doing the animation.

447
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,920
Yeah.
Because you know,

448
00:29:36,921 --> 00:29:40,190
animation is like a meditation when you,
when you made an old story,

449
00:29:40,191 --> 00:29:41,024
it's just a long out meditation on it 
and sometimes insights can pop up while 

450
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:46,630
you're working on it.

451
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,640
I mean,
it's just like in your face everyday.

452
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,980
I mean,
I have there,

453
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,020
there are insights that I have.
One of them,

454
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,913
a lot of them are comparative religion 
insights because the previous film with 

455
00:29:56,141 --> 00:29:56,974
Sita sings the blues.
So in this film I included Aaron a lot 

456
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,563
in Sita sings the blues.
I left out Luckman who is a Rahm's 

457
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,703
brother.
And I decided not to do that here even 

458
00:30:09,461 --> 00:30:12,640
though with a lot of these stories when 
they're turned into films,

459
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,623
Erin is made into this minor character 
and a lot of things that Aaron does in 

460
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:22,321
movies they show Moses doing,
like casting the staff down and it turns

461
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:25,480
into a snake that was,
that was Aaron's business.

462
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:26,314
But anyway,
I showed Aaron in this and I fought 

463
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,550
about how both stories have these 
brothers,

464
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,443
they have like the big important,
memorable brother and the other brother 

465
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:36,820
who actually carries out quite a bit of 
the work.

466
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:38,803
Um,
so that's a similarity and of course 

467
00:30:40,811 --> 00:30:45,811
both stories also have a really gruesome
scene after what we normally think of as

468
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:48,280
the end.
Like with exodus,

469
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,173
especially growing up with Passover,
I'd always thought the story was the 

470
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,080
Hebrews were slaves and then you know,
they were free,

471
00:30:58,181 --> 00:30:59,350
right?
Like the end is,

472
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,213
they're free.
They crossed the Red Sea to get away 

473
00:31:01,241 --> 00:31:02,074
from the Egyptians for Ray.
And of course what actually happens in 

474
00:31:05,111 --> 00:31:05,944
the story after that is there's this 
Hebrew on Hebrew slaughter because of 

475
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:14,230
the golden calf and a whole bunch of 
those Hebrews who were liberated,

476
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,303
they die.

477
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:16,601
Yeah.
Well,

478
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:19,240
liberation turns out to be a very 
complicated thing.

479
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,483
Yeah.
You know,

480
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:21,483
it's funny when I,
when I watched the Americans go into 

481
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:25,550
Iraq,
you know,

482
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,433
with her initial optimism and then the 
absolute disintegration of the Iraqi 

483
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:31,720
state,
I thought,

484
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,583
well,
and then the failure to produce 

485
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:35,040
something,
you know,

486
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,450
stable.
And as a consequence,

487
00:31:37,451 --> 00:31:38,284
I thought,
well,

488
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:41,410
a little bit of exodus would have gone a
long ways.

489
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,410
It was quite funny in some sense because
in a black way,

490
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:50,230
because of course the people who invaded
Iraq who planned the invasion or

491
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:55,840
we're at least nominally committed 
Christians and I thought,

492
00:31:55,841 --> 00:31:56,674
well,
they took out the tyrant like just as 

493
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:01,950
the Hebrews escape from retirement,
let's say,

494
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,930
but you know,
exodus lays it out pretty clearly is you

495
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:09,880
escaped from tyranny into the desert and
that's no joke and it's 40 years,

496
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:12,280
right?
It's three generations before the desert

497
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,850
disappears and in the desert there's 
nothing but inter,

498
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,460
inter tribal warfare and,
and,

499
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,830
and,
and the,

500
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:24,580
and the conflict around new emerging 
values,

501
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:25,414
which is of course that the conflict 
between the idealization of the golden 

502
00:32:29,561 --> 00:32:33,010
calf and,
and the necessity for the new rules that

503
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:34,240
Moses imposes.

504
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:37,930
It's no picnic and then meet.
A lot of the old testament is like that.

505
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,550
Even.
I've been a series of lectures.

506
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:41,384
I don't know if you know about this,
but I've done 12 lectures on the old 

507
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:46,280
testament that have actually become 
quite popular.

508
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:50,600
I think the first one has about three 
quarters of a million views and I'd been

509
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:55,050
attempting to treat the stories with as 
much respect as I can because like you,

510
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:58,940
I believe that their foundation stories 
and um,

511
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,850
I would say that my respect for them has
actually grown and,

512
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,833
and,
and my relationship with whatever you 

513
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:08,870
might regard as transcendent has been 
improved by that,

514
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:09,763
but
be that as it may even in the story of 

515
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,690
Abraham,
you know,

516
00:33:14,691 --> 00:33:17,720
he's called forward by God to go out 
into the world.

517
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,730
He's an old man by that time,
right?

518
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,280
He's 75 years old.
He should have left his family,

519
00:33:22,281 --> 00:33:26,060
his father's house and,
and his kinsmen long before.

520
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:29,990
But God calls him on an adventure to go 
out into the land of the stranger and to

521
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,490
leave his home.
And you know,

522
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,430
it just goes terribly badly.
For Abraham,

523
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:36,800
it means the first thing he encounters 
is a famine.

524
00:33:36,801 --> 00:33:38,960
And then he moves into the tyranny of 
Egypt.

525
00:33:38,961 --> 00:33:39,794
And then,
you know,

526
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:40,763
the Pharaoh takes his wife.
So it's one of the things that you can 

527
00:33:45,171 --> 00:33:46,004
say about the old testament is that it's
not easily optimistic in any sense of 

528
00:33:49,731 --> 00:33:50,564
the word,

529
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:57,040
but the Passover story kind of is as,
it's as people observe it,

530
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:02,540
like when you read the Passover story,
it's just this nice part and that,

531
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:06,510
like I say that other part,
that later chapter,

532
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:10,090
we never discussed that at Passover and 
you know,

533
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,360
the closest will come as 40 years in the
desert.

534
00:34:12,361 --> 00:34:15,870
Like I didn't know that the Jews 
wandered the desert for 40 years.

535
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,180
I didn't know they kill each other.
Right.

536
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,493
And,
and this is something that's similar to 

537
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:21,624
the Ramayana because the Ramayana is 
frequently told without the last 

538
00:34:25,561 --> 00:34:27,110
chapter,
without the authority Aconda,

539
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,980
which is the difficult part,
right.

540
00:34:28,981 --> 00:34:32,490
Which I think is the richest and most 
interesting part of the whole story.

541
00:34:32,491 --> 00:34:34,770
So I focused on it in Sita sings the 
blues.

542
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:36,243
Um,
but,

543
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,980
but yeah,
I mean I think that what

544
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,823
the most valuable parts of these stories
are the most difficult and other parts 

545
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:46,230
that are left out.
Most people don't know about.

546
00:34:46,231 --> 00:34:47,370
You have to actually read them.

547
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,473
It will be the most useful parts because
life is full of difficulty and so with 

548
00:34:53,051 --> 00:34:53,884
you over,
if you leap over the parts of the 

549
00:34:56,741 --> 00:35:01,540
stories that are pessimistic and dark,
then you missed part of what the stories

550
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:04,870
are trying to teach you about how to 
prepare for catastrophe mean it says,

551
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:05,853
obviously in the exodus story,
the fact that the Hebrews escaped from 

552
00:35:09,851 --> 00:35:13,420
tyranny is presented as a good segue and
even as something that God wills,

553
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:14,283
but it's by no means a straightforward 
passage from tyranny to the promised 

554
00:35:19,361 --> 00:35:19,861
land.
I mean,

555
00:35:19,861 --> 00:35:22,420
in Moses doesn't make it to the promised
land right here.

556
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,100
He dies before he gets there.

557
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,600
Yeah,
and even the promised land is not nearly

558
00:35:27,601 --> 00:35:31,950
as much fun as it's been as we have been
led to believe,

559
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:32,890
right?
Like they're,

560
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:36,150
they're constantly the Jews that are 
constantly falling short.

561
00:35:36,151 --> 00:35:38,010
Right?
They're constantly and God,

562
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,990
they're never getting their shit 
together.

563
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,150
You know,
God just keeps,

564
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,680
you know,
God's ambivalence towards persists.

565
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:47,881
Yeah.
Yeah.

566
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:48,714
Well,
well,

567
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:53,730
and I also think that's very realistic 
because there are very few times in life

568
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:59,121
where even if you're not suffering from 
the tyranny of other people or yourself,

569
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:02,010
that it's very difficult to walk the 
proper,

570
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,873
straight and narrow path and to keep 
everything organized and to keep things 

571
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:06,144
going.
Property.

572
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,053
And there's no,
there's never any shortage of severe 

573
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:10,930
challenges.
Yeah.

574
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,230
So in that,
even if you're chosen by God,

575
00:36:13,231 --> 00:36:14,064
let's say,
there's no shortage of severe 

576
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:15,864
challenges,
you also see that in all the other 

577
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:19,000
stories in the Old Testament.
I mean,

578
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,593
even when God is walking with someone,
say like Abraham or Noah for that 

579
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:25,854
matter,
it's pretty still pretty much nonstop 

580
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:28,920
carnage.
I mean,

581
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,510
noah,
Noah has his family together and um,

582
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,130
his generations are perfect,
right?

583
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:37,950
And he walks with God so he's properly 
oriented in the world,

584
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:42,951
but he still has to build the Ark and,
and get through the damn storm and,

585
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,570
and,
and,

586
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,460
and be humiliated by his children at the
end.

587
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:49,200
And it's,
it's,

588
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,440
it's very rough business.
So in the,

589
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,900
in one of your,
uh,

590
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,780
shorts and I don't know the name of it,
it's the one where the,

591
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,673
I guess it's the one that specifically 
deals with the Passover where the 

592
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:03,740
Egyptian firstborns are all killed.
Yeah.

593
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,400
Yeah.
What's that one called?

594
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,650
Death of the firstborn.
Egyptians go,

595
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,180
hold on.

596
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,620
There we go.
And appropriate title.

597
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,473
I can't help but harbored the suspicion 
that you had a fair bit of sympathy for 

598
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:16,100
the Egyptians.

599
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,460
Yeah.
Well,

600
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:21,900
you know,
they had some great art.

601
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:23,563
Yes.

602
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,800
Yeah.
And you do a wonderful job by the way of

603
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:26,634
incorporating that into that film.
It's not wanting to spectacularly 

604
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,414
beautiful.

605
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,480
Well thank you.
And they had religion and uh,

606
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,000
so doing visual research for this 
project,

607
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,713
there was not a lot of really great 
ancient Hebrew art possibly or probably 

608
00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:54,360
because it's against the religion to 
make art.

609
00:37:54,361 --> 00:37:56,340
You're not supposed to make graven 
images.

610
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:57,174
So
in terms of coming up with a style that 

611
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:04,170
evoked this,
I had to,

612
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,810
I was looking at art from the region and
I was like,

613
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,210
oh,
it's all Egyptian and Syrian.

614
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:13,290
Those are the ones.
Those are the people there that made the

615
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,124
art fantastic art.
It breaks my heart that that's supposed 

616
00:38:19,711 --> 00:38:20,700
to be evil,
right?

617
00:38:20,701 --> 00:38:21,331
That,
that,

618
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:22,164
that art,
which actually moves me when I look at 

619
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:27,450
it,
is what we're supposed to smash,

620
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,111
right?
Like,

621
00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:28,944
that's,
that's what we're commanded to destroy 

622
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,850
because it's,
it's all full of idols.

623
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,230
Um,
I,

624
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,143
I'm not down with that.
So I just naturally was going to 

625
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:41,520
sympathize with the Egyptians.
This is all we'll do.

626
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:46,880
There's a real tension there that I 
think is worth thinking about,

627
00:38:46,881 --> 00:38:47,714
you know,
because I understand why from a 

628
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:51,594
psychological perspective and understand
why there was an injunction against 

629
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:57,170
making images and you know,
you see the same thing,

630
00:38:57,171 --> 00:39:00,870
kept it out right now with isis say in 
the Middle East where they're destroying

631
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:01,830
the world,
for example,

632
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,790
all the great Buddhist art and all those
ancient monuments,

633
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:09,090
which of course is an absolute and utter
catastrophe,

634
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,493
but

635
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,393
religion,
I mean they were following it better 

636
00:39:13,281 --> 00:39:14,114
than we do.

637
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,300
Right,
right.

638
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:15,901
Well,
so,

639
00:39:15,901 --> 00:39:20,220
so the conundrum seems to me to be that,
and this is also played out in the story

640
00:39:20,221 --> 00:39:23,230
of exodus with the golden calf,
is that no,

641
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,670
the idea of God is supposed to be 
something at least in principle,

642
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,533
that you can't really grip,
that you can't really encapsulate that 

643
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,093
know that you can't dogmatically 
represent because then it turns into an 

644
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:37,380
idol and an article in etiology are very
much the same thing.

645
00:39:37,381 --> 00:39:39,930
And I think ideology is terribly 
dangerous.

646
00:39:39,931 --> 00:39:42,270
You know,
because you take something concrete like

647
00:39:42,271 --> 00:39:44,050
an axiom of some sort,
you,

648
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:44,983
you,
you,

649
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:45,893
that's very concrete.
And then you make that your highest 

650
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,233
value and it narrows you and,
and restricts you and also makes you 

651
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:52,044
incredibly dangerous.
And so the idea that there's a great 

652
00:39:55,711 --> 00:39:59,670
danger in idolization I think is a,
is a very,

653
00:39:59,671 --> 00:40:00,504
very powerful notion.
And so I think that's what informed the 

654
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:03,834
restrictions against making graven 
images of God because you end up 

655
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:10,770
confusing the image with the 
transcendent reality.

656
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:11,663
Right?
And then you think that you understand 

657
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:13,344
it and you have it in your hands,
but it certainly does seem to have some 

658
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:17,214
pretty dramatically negative 
consequences when the consequence of 

659
00:40:20,371 --> 00:40:23,790
that is the absence of visual arc in any
profound sense.

660
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:28,791
And also this injunction to destroy the 
idols of well of the foreigner or,

661
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,510
or of the,
of the person who's heretical or,

662
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,030
or,
and I,

663
00:40:35,031 --> 00:40:37,770
I'm not exactly sure how to.
What would you say?

664
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:43,000
I'm not exactly sure what the mediating 
path is between those two extremes and I

665
00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:44,500
think a real artist and,
and,

666
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,370
and,
and I,

667
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:50,370
I definitely think that you belong in 
that category is someone who isn't using

668
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,373
idols as representation because you're 
using your artistic talent to push 

669
00:40:56,701 --> 00:40:57,534
beyond what you already know.
Like it's a form of exploration rather 

670
00:41:00,151 --> 00:41:04,680
than a form of Canada [inaudible] or,
or categorization,

671
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,191
right?
It's,

672
00:41:05,191 --> 00:41:06,420
it's a,
it's a,

673
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,500
it's a journey into the unknown and an 
extension of the way that people think.

674
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:14,520
And I think of that as a way of uniting 
with the transcendent rather than trying

675
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:17,880
to encapsulate it in some sort of 
formulate box.

676
00:41:17,881 --> 00:41:21,870
But there is a great danger of that kind
of formula formulization.

677
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,760
So anyways,

678
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,753
there is that danger and that's,
that is of course the commonest 

679
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:31,700
interpretation of the injunction against
idols.

680
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:35,770
But I think,
I mean it's,

681
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,630
it's never borne out,
right?

682
00:41:37,631 --> 00:41:42,631
It's like any injunction against that 
kind of a idolatry has never resulted in

683
00:41:46,361 --> 00:41:49,570
the absence of idolatry ever.
Uh,

684
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,270
and we can clearly do it with abstract 
concepts.

685
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,133
We can clearly do it.
You have a clearly don't need images to 

686
00:41:55,331 --> 00:41:56,164
do this.

687
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,890
You could argue that you could do it 
with words just as effectively

688
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:05,230
you never have anything.
And so if it doesn't work,

689
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,220
I wondered while I was working on the 
film,

690
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:11,683
whether it might have been a simple and 
misunderstood injunction against using 

691
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,053
Egyptian hieroglyphics and that it,
it was a requirement to use submitted 

692
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:22,903
written language rather than Egyptian 
because Egyptian hieroglyphics are full 

693
00:42:27,351 --> 00:42:32,330
of things that fly in the air and things
that crawl on the ground and things that

694
00:42:32,331 --> 00:42:34,940
swim in the sea and men and women.
All that stuff.

695
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:37,440
Because I was working on these little 
animated hieroglyphs and I was like,

696
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:40,220
maybe it was just this.
Which would have made sense,

697
00:42:40,221 --> 00:42:41,180
right,
because

698
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,873
because anti-depression when when these 
stories were written down and they were 

699
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,440
promoting the Semitic language,
that's what you were supposed to use.

700
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,480
Well now we've put it in some sense in 
the same categories,

701
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,120
the dietary prescriptions,
right?

702
00:42:55,121 --> 00:42:55,954
Because the best evidence for the reason
for those dietary prescriptions isn't 

703
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,980
hygiene or anything like that.
It's don't eat the food that you're,

704
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,220
that the people who worship other gods 
eat.

705
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,350
Right.
And there's a variety of,

706
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,010
of useful reasons for that.
Certainly one of them.

707
00:43:12,011 --> 00:43:13,320
Is that it?
Yep.

708
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:14,543
Yeah.
Well it's a price at an advantages that 

709
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,153
the people you eat with your kinsmen and
your tribesmen pretty much by 

710
00:43:21,251 --> 00:43:23,560
definition.
And so if you share a pallet,

711
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:27,040
if you share a menu and there and you 
share it restrictions,

712
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:27,874
it's much easier for you to socialize 
with the people who have the same 

713
00:43:30,011 --> 00:43:30,844
restrictions that you do.
So it seems to be a reasonably 

714
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:35,330
intelligent way of keeping your culture 
cohesive.

715
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:36,483
While it certainly,
it certainly worked for a very long 

716
00:43:38,261 --> 00:43:43,090
period of time so that that would be an 
idea that's in keeping with that,

717
00:43:43,091 --> 00:43:43,924
isn't it?
You certainly don't use the idol 

718
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,233
representations of the people who you 
are not because then you integrate with 

719
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,930
them and your and your culture 
disappears.

720
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:54,800
Right.
And you don't use their language and you

721
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:55,634
don't use.
You don't write down things that they 

722
00:43:56,781 --> 00:43:57,614
can read.

723
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:03,270
Right.
But so much of these books of Moses were

724
00:44:03,271 --> 00:44:05,160
about being different from your 
neighbors.

725
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:08,100
Like don't let your neighbors corrupt 
you are different from your neighbors.

726
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:11,310
And interestingly,
I was raised with that,

727
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,960
right?
Like my father,

728
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,183
the atheist Jew was adamant about
not doing the Christmas things when I 

729
00:44:22,051 --> 00:44:24,130
went to school.
Uh,

730
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,553
you know,
they would have Christmas projects in 

731
00:44:27,211 --> 00:44:30,360
the winter and he would say,
just tell your teacher you don't have to

732
00:44:30,361 --> 00:44:32,010
do this project,
you're Jewish.

733
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,233
He never said you don't have to do the 
project because you're an atheist just 

734
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,130
because you're Jewish.
Right.

735
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,113
Right.
And so we maintain some sort of 

736
00:44:40,081 --> 00:44:45,081
difference in spite of not actually 
practicing Jewish religion.

737
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:47,154
Really.

738
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,073
Yeah.
Well that's one of the things that's 

739
00:44:48,651 --> 00:44:51,680
always been interesting,
interesting to me about Judaism,

740
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:55,420
particularly in a mystery I would say.
And you know,

741
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,393
I think there are very many ways of 
believing in God and one way of 

742
00:45:00,201 --> 00:45:05,201
believing is conscious and that would be
the sort of belief that you can state as

743
00:45:07,131 --> 00:45:07,964
I believe or I don't believe,
and I think in some sense that's the 

744
00:45:11,271 --> 00:45:14,940
weakest form of belief and it's also the
one that's most easily undermined.

745
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:16,423
I think the more profound forms of 
belief or ones that you act out there 

746
00:45:20,241 --> 00:45:21,074
like a dance in some sense and they're 
built into your behavioral coding and 

747
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,873
they're not so easily criticized and 
undermined because they don't really 

748
00:45:28,371 --> 00:45:30,890
operate at an intellectual level.
No.

749
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,240
Like,
like for example,

750
00:45:32,241 --> 00:45:36,820
watching your videos
and it's not,

751
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:40,010
they're not reduceable to an 
intellectual exercise.

752
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:41,670
You know,
I can't watch them.

753
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:45,560
And first of all I can't say exactly 
what it is that you're up to.

754
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,113
And even if I could lay out a reasonably
comprehensive description of what you 

755
00:45:50,301 --> 00:45:51,051
are up to,
which,

756
00:45:51,051 --> 00:45:51,884
which would be by no means complete.
It wouldn't be easy for me to mountain 

757
00:45:54,891 --> 00:45:59,330
intellectual attack on that.
Because because of your use use of dance

758
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:00,223
in some sense with the catapults and 
your use of imagery in your use of 

759
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,333
music,
it it puts the entire discussion on a 

760
00:46:06,951 --> 00:46:10,940
plane that can't be easily reducible to 
an intellectual discussion.

761
00:46:10,941 --> 00:46:14,810
And so in Judaism you see this,
and this is the case,

762
00:46:14,811 --> 00:46:15,644
I think with the atheist Jews perhaps 
most self evidently is that the rituals 

763
00:46:20,781 --> 00:46:21,614
are kept in.
The division is kept and the encoded 

764
00:46:23,811 --> 00:46:27,140
actions are kept and the person might 
say,

765
00:46:27,141 --> 00:46:28,490
well,
I don't believe in God,

766
00:46:28,491 --> 00:46:31,490
and the proper objection to that might 
be something like,

767
00:46:31,491 --> 00:46:32,324
well,
you might say that you don't believe in 

768
00:46:34,221 --> 00:46:35,870
God,
but you sure acted out.

769
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:38,840
It seems to me that,
you know,

770
00:46:38,841 --> 00:46:40,940
people have asked me about my religious 
faith,

771
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:45,540
which is a question that I find quite 
intrusive and I'm not that.

772
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:46,403
No,
not that people don't have the right to 

773
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:50,540
ask it because they certainly do.
But I mean I'm,

774
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,153
I'm sufficiently.
I'm ignorant about my own orientations 

775
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,180
in some sense to not know exactly how to
answer that.

776
00:46:59,181 --> 00:47:04,181
But one answer that I find quite useful 
and I think fairly truthfulness that are

777
00:47:04,631 --> 00:47:09,631
certainly act as if there's a god and 
then the rest of it I leave I suppose in

778
00:47:11,121 --> 00:47:15,290
some sense in a cloud of an,
of as,

779
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:16,124
of yet into bleakly explored ignorance 
because I do believe that human beings 

780
00:47:20,451 --> 00:47:22,490
have a relationship with the 
transcendent.

781
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:25,790
Now I see that manifest itself in,
in great art,

782
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:26,624
for example,
where people seem to be able to reach 

783
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:32,080
beyond to produce something that's a 
spectacular,

784
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:32,943
lasting,
intense emotional and practical 

785
00:47:35,111 --> 00:47:35,920
significance.

786
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,810
That's the realm of inspiration,
you know?

787
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:38,644
And I don't think that we understand 
that very well at all and I don't think 

788
00:47:41,601 --> 00:47:45,970
that we understand consciousness very 
well as well at all in stockton.

789
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,630
I think it is a fundamental element of 
being so.

790
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,030
But,
but it is interesting and it in,

791
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:54,480
in your,
in your work too,

792
00:47:54,481 --> 00:47:55,314
like I see it.
It's interesting to hear you talk about 

793
00:47:57,761 --> 00:48:00,250
it.
I see a profound religious,

794
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:02,490
what would you call it?
Oh

795
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:05,223
well I see a profound religious spirit 
at work and it's so interesting to me 

796
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,793
that your experience of reading exodus 
and also doing these animations has 

797
00:48:13,361 --> 00:48:17,680
actually for you being an increased 
sense of divorce from the,

798
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:20,240
from let's say the realities of the 
text.

799
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,790
Yeah,
but you know that.

800
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:27,230
So the word I use to describe it as I 
was bereft,

801
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:29,253
uh,
after spending all this time with them 

802
00:48:31,591 --> 00:48:33,420
because the more time I met with the 
tests,

803
00:48:33,421 --> 00:48:35,340
the more time I spent working on this,
the,

804
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,413
the,
just the other less connected to 

805
00:48:39,811 --> 00:48:44,811
anything I would call God I felt.
And after I finished those scenes,

806
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:51,590
it took me a really long time to get 
inspiration for finishing the film.

807
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:59,090
I guess I finished the last scene of it,
of the Moses parts a year and a half ago

808
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,073
and I just could not continue working on
the film because I was thinking like 

809
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:04,643
more Moses,
more old testament and it just made me 

810
00:49:07,021 --> 00:49:10,650
feel sick every time I approached it.

811
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:12,763
Is it possible just out of curiosity 
that that was a form of something like 

812
00:49:15,951 --> 00:49:18,360
spiritual exhaustion?
Because it'd be.

813
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,410
Your films are very,
very serious and they're,

814
00:49:21,411 --> 00:49:22,244
and they're,
and they're very complex and so I kind 

815
00:49:25,161 --> 00:49:27,450
of wonder too,
is if you just haven't like,

816
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,300
drained yourself of,
of,

817
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,600
of inspiration as a consequence of 
working on this for so long.

818
00:49:32,601 --> 00:49:34,190
I mean,
they're very complex,

819
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,980
deep themes and you know,
as you said,

820
00:49:36,981 --> 00:49:37,814
they do sit at the bottom of the culture
and it's no joke to mess around with 

821
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:41,444
that kind of thing.

822
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:45,950
That's true.
But I now see what I was missing.

823
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:46,610
I mean,
I've,

824
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:49,970
I've,
my Muse has returned so I,

825
00:49:49,971 --> 00:49:52,220
you know,
I could say that I'm not religious,

826
00:49:52,221 --> 00:49:53,054
but I clearly practice like a religious 
person because I have a Mus and I'm 

827
00:49:56,301 --> 00:49:57,134
inspired by my muse and I have faith in 
my muse and I even have prayer that I 

828
00:49:59,931 --> 00:50:02,090
say to my muse.
So,

829
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:03,440
uh,
that's,

830
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:04,740
you know,
that's,

831
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:09,740
that's a sort of religious lifestyle or
spiritual one anyway.

832
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:10,891
Yes.
Well,

833
00:50:10,891 --> 00:50:11,311
you.
Okay.

834
00:50:11,311 --> 00:50:15,230
And so you said that you even prayed to 
tell.

835
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,330
Tell me,
tell me about the muse.

836
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:17,971
Okay.
Well,

837
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:19,590
would you like to hear it?
My Muse prayer?

838
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:21,930
Sure,
definitely amusing.

839
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:22,853
Okay.
Our idea which art in the ether that be 

840
00:50:27,601 --> 00:50:28,434
named by vision come by,
we'll be done on earth as it is an 

841
00:50:32,791 --> 00:50:35,700
abstraction.
Give us this day,

842
00:50:35,701 --> 00:50:36,534
our daily spark,
and forgive us our criticisms as we 

843
00:50:39,391 --> 00:50:44,391
forgive those who critique against us 
and lead us not into stagnation,

844
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,350
but deliver us from ego for dynasty 
division,

845
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:50,910
the power and the glory forever.
Amen.

846
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:58,600
That certainly seems to me to be like,
I would think of that as a,

847
00:50:58,690 --> 00:50:59,523
as a,
a mantra to open up the gateway between 

848
00:51:02,481 --> 00:51:06,200
you and this transcendent forest that 
allows people religious inspiration.

849
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,300
I mean,
and you're doing something like clearing

850
00:51:08,301 --> 00:51:09,134
out your ego and I think it is very 
interesting that it's associated with 

851
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:13,990
the,
with the,

852
00:51:13,991 --> 00:51:15,650
uh,
the Lord's prayer,

853
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:18,340
especially with regards to,
you know,

854
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:22,790
you make this interesting identity 
between criticism and temptation.

855
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,560
No.
In one of the things,

856
00:51:24,561 --> 00:51:27,800
of course it does interfere with 
stagnation.

857
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,930
Yes.
But yes,

858
00:51:29,931 --> 00:51:32,540
but deliver us from criticism.
I think you something you,

859
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:33,713
yeah.
Faded,

860
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,250
but deliver us.
Oh wait,

861
00:51:36,251 --> 00:51:38,160
wait,
but deliver us from ego.

862
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:39,863
Oh boy.
I will forgive us our criticisms as we 

863
00:51:42,301 --> 00:51:43,330
forgive those who critique.

864
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,633
Yes,
that that well and the criticism that 

865
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:46,883
that.
That's a very interesting element of it 

866
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:48,624
too because it's often the case.
One of the things that I teach my 

867
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:52,524
students when they're writing is to get 
a critical spirit the hell out of the 

868
00:51:54,871 --> 00:51:56,430
way to begin with.
No,

869
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,353
because what people try to do is produce
and edit at the same time and you 

870
00:52:00,901 --> 00:52:01,734
actually can't do that.
What you have to do is open yourself up 

871
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,793
to the to the to to the creative process
and all of its errors because when you 

872
00:52:10,381 --> 00:52:11,214
first start,
it's going to be very much error 

873
00:52:12,301 --> 00:52:13,134
written,
but you have to allow yourself to 

874
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,833
manifest that ever written spark of 
creativity to begin with and keep the 

875
00:52:20,071 --> 00:52:24,990
criticism at bay and also the ego 
element I think is extremely interesting

876
00:52:24,991 --> 00:52:25,824
because to the degree that you're trying
to bend your artistic production to the 

877
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:34,110
proximal demands of your ego,
then you actually.

878
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:38,100
You've polluted you propaganda is it and
you reduce it.

879
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,550
I would say to something like an idol 
because it then it.

880
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:41,703
Then it's to serve some other master 
rather than whatever it is that is 

881
00:52:45,391 --> 00:52:47,610
supposed to be in some sense flowing 
through you.

882
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:52,343
That's a good way to put it.
I have a real problem doing work for 

883
00:52:54,991 --> 00:52:59,130
money.
I love money and what I like to do is do

884
00:52:59,131 --> 00:53:01,770
my work and then encourage people to 
send me money.

885
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,590
But the whole,
this whole thing where somebody says,

886
00:53:07,591 --> 00:53:09,540
I'll give you this money if you do the 
work.

887
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:10,853
I've done that.
It's just called being a professional 

888
00:53:12,721 --> 00:53:16,580
artist and it never works out for me.
I mean,

889
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,670
I did this,
a segment of this commercial film.

890
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,950
Um,
ironically it was Kahlil Gibran,

891
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,180
the profit,
uh,

892
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:30,240
all animated and I did it for money.
I got paid well.

893
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:31,403
I thought it was never going to animate 
again after that because it burned me 

894
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:34,344
out so badly.
It was a really unpleasant process 

895
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:40,500
because the authority in this was not my
muse.

896
00:53:40,501 --> 00:53:42,660
The authority was the people with the 
money.

897
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:43,733
Really.

898
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:47,770
The money you subjugating the greater to
the lesser.

899
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,480
Yeah.
And if I do that even a little bit,

900
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:55,120
it's,
the feeling is horrible and I can.

901
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,720
I liken it to how I imagine 
prostitution,

902
00:53:59,721 --> 00:54:02,630
like all the warnings about prostitution
and what it,

903
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:06,500
what it does to your soul,
even if you think it's Hunky Dory.

904
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,060
Um,
I,

905
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:11,870
I can relate to that when I do the work 
for money,

906
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,170
it's really different than when I'm 
doing it.

907
00:54:15,171 --> 00:54:15,750
Right.

908
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:17,410
Okay.
So which of your prayer.

909
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,910
So now you've modified the Lord's 
prayer.

910
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:24,790
Yeah.
And so did you write that down?

911
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:25,624
Like how,
how in the world did you come up with 

912
00:54:26,621 --> 00:54:28,750
this?
Thank you for actually telling me.

913
00:54:28,751 --> 00:54:29,584
I'm quite amazed that you did because of
course it's a peculiar thing and I mean 

914
00:54:33,101 --> 00:54:33,934
that in the best possible sense,
but it seems also to be quite a private 

915
00:54:36,971 --> 00:54:37,804
thing

916
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:39,913
out about it since,
I mean the thing with the blues is it 

917
00:54:41,901 --> 00:54:46,901
was such a profoundly weird experience 
making that film and it was so much like

918
00:54:48,111 --> 00:54:51,200
the channeling and it was so much just 
getting out of my own way.

919
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:53,230
Um,
that I,

920
00:54:53,231 --> 00:54:56,420
I did want to share that.
I mean because people would ask me these

921
00:54:56,421 --> 00:54:58,080
questions.
So how did you make that?

922
00:54:58,081 --> 00:54:59,960
And it's like,
I don't ever really know,

923
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:05,110
Jeremy,
you said you got out of your own way,

924
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:07,200
you know,
in one of the things that,

925
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:10,330
that,
that I've been struck by with regards to

926
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,193
both the prophetic tradition in the Old 
Testament and also the passion story in 

927
00:55:15,731 --> 00:55:18,250
the New Testament,
is that there's a tremendous emphasis in

928
00:55:18,251 --> 00:55:21,550
those stories are on getting out of your
own way,

929
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,920
you know,
because the idea is supposed to be.

930
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,310
This is part of the idea of the dying 
and resurrected hero of course,

931
00:55:27,311 --> 00:55:31,240
is that you're supposed to let 
everything in you that gets in your way,

932
00:55:31,241 --> 00:55:36,241
burn away and die so that whatever can 
flow through you that,

933
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:40,180
that has true value and that's oriented 
towards the highest good,

934
00:55:40,181 --> 00:55:41,014
let's say.
Which I think is what you're doing when 

935
00:55:42,371 --> 00:55:44,470
you're establishing a relationship with 
your muse,

936
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:47,740
is that there isn't anything that's part
of the Ego,

937
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:51,700
part of that critical capacity that's,
that's inappropriate or part of,

938
00:55:51,701 --> 00:55:54,880
let's say,
worldly concerns that's interfering with

939
00:55:54,881 --> 00:55:58,290
your ability to reach beyond yourself.
And that's,

940
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,880
that's a holy calling.
I would say it's.

941
00:56:00,881 --> 00:56:03,550
And maybe it's the primary holy calling.
I think,

942
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:04,970
I certainly think it is,
it's,

943
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:05,833
it seems to me to be the case and I,
I do think in some sense that's what 

944
00:56:08,621 --> 00:56:11,440
artists act out when they're really 
being artists because they're,

945
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:15,880
they're establishing a relationship with
the source of inspiration,

946
00:56:15,881 --> 00:56:16,714
whatever that is.
And it's not like we understand that we 

947
00:56:19,121 --> 00:56:21,010
don't understand that it's something 
that's very,

948
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:21,844
very deep.

949
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,110
Yeah,
I do.

950
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:24,010
Or I

951
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:24,843
do believe if I have beliefs,
I do believe that regarding it as 

952
00:56:29,111 --> 00:56:29,944
something that comes from elsewhere,
something bigger than yourself is for 

953
00:56:33,011 --> 00:56:33,940
me.
Helpful.

954
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:35,441
Uh,
I don't,

955
00:56:35,441 --> 00:56:36,274
I don't like this idea that it's all me.
I'm connected to other people and 

956
00:56:40,571 --> 00:56:41,404
connected through culture and through 
language which is culture and through 

957
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:44,860
art,
which is culture.

958
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:50,200
I mean I'm just like a fish swimming in 
a sea of culture on a,

959
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:51,453
what we call creating is really 
absorbing and processing all of this 

960
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:03,060
culture that I'm a part of and just 
expressing a little bit out.

961
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,460
I'm very dubious.
And the idea of originality.

962
00:57:06,461 --> 00:57:09,250
For example,
I wrote an essay about that,

963
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:14,650
the cult of originality.
I think that's delusional.

964
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,440
Maybe difficult part of the originality 
idea is that it's it,

965
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:20,623
it's tied up with ego
because I think that people can be 

966
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:25,324
spectacularly original,
but I don't know if you give to 

967
00:57:27,251 --> 00:57:29,160
attribute that to their ego,
you know,

968
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:34,190
Tibet part of them that you call me and 
the mind is a very strange place because

969
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:39,690
there's obviously a part of it that we,
that we identify with as ourselves.

970
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,593
That would be,
to me that would be the ego and it's 

971
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:43,003
obviously it and it's the thing I think 
that is capable of generating eagle 

972
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,473
testicle criticisms and,
and standing on principles for self 

973
00:57:53,141 --> 00:57:55,750
defense or for dominance display or 
something like that.

974
00:57:55,751 --> 00:57:56,281
That's,
you know,

975
00:57:56,281 --> 00:58:00,010
it's sort of a,
it operates at a relatively low level of

976
00:58:00,011 --> 00:58:00,844
moral virtue.
But then there's parts of us that are 

977
00:58:02,651 --> 00:58:05,500
obviously far beyond ourselves,
you know,

978
00:58:05,501 --> 00:58:07,050
and that's the part,
for example,

979
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:11,140
to generate dreams and visions and 
perhaps even ideas.

980
00:58:11,141 --> 00:58:14,400
Because one of the things I really liked
about reading curl young,

981
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:18,070
one of the things he made me really 
conscious of was the fact that.

982
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:21,580
And nature of course talked about this 
in the same way.

983
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:25,600
To some degree is that it's not so much 
that you have ideas,

984
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:27,940
it's the one you could say,
no,

985
00:58:27,941 --> 00:58:30,370
no,
don't be so sure about that.

986
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:33,310
The ideas have you.
So there's that,

987
00:58:33,311 --> 00:58:34,630
and then the next thing is,
well,

988
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:37,450
it isn't so much that you think up the 
ideas,

989
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:38,493
it's that you encountered them if you 
open yourself up to the possibility of 

990
00:58:41,861 --> 00:58:42,694
encountering them and it is like a 
process of discovery rather than a 

991
00:58:45,671 --> 00:58:47,920
process of origination,
let's say.

992
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,333
And that's also so you could say,
even if you're like a biological 

993
00:58:52,181 --> 00:58:53,014
materialist,
which I actually don't think you can be 

994
00:58:55,391 --> 00:58:59,560
because biological materialism doesn't 
help us account for consciousness in the

995
00:58:59,561 --> 00:59:00,580
least.
So far.

996
00:59:00,581 --> 00:59:02,230
We don't have a good theory of 
consciousness.

997
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:03,463
You're saying like a biological 
materialist theory of consciousness 

998
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:09,340
because I'm a biological materialists.
Biology exists.

999
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:10,503
Well,
yes,

1000
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:11,510
of course.

1001
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:14,330
I just don't.
I just don't think that it provides.

1002
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:15,253
It isn't sophisticated enough to provide
answers to some of the most fundamental 

1003
00:59:18,081 --> 00:59:20,870
questions about human existence that 
we're.

1004
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,211
Right.
No,

1005
00:59:22,211 --> 00:59:23,530
I agree with that.
And you know,

1006
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:27,140
the idea that you just expressed that 
when you're in a creative,

1007
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:28,323
uh,
when you're engaging in the creative 

1008
00:59:29,301 --> 00:59:31,820
process with whatever it is that you're 
praying to,

1009
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:36,080
let's say that you're opening yourself 
up to something that's beyond you.

1010
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:40,130
Now you could say that that comes from 
deep within the human psyche,

1011
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:43,300
which is a psychoanalytic way of 
thinking about it and,

1012
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,760
and I think a reasonably appropriate way
of thinking about it,

1013
00:59:46,761 --> 00:59:47,594
but I don't think it's any more 
reasonable in some sense than making 

1014
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:52,244
the,
generating the hypothesis that you're 

1015
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:54,464
opening yourself up to unknown forces in
the cosmos because I think that's just 

1016
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:03,680
as just as intelligent and account for 
the phenomena as the,

1017
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:05,540
as the,
as the former one,

1018
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:09,110
we are in contact with things that are 
beyond us.

1019
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:13,970
And I do think that that's a large part 
of what the artist actually demonstrates

1020
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,433
and keeps and keeps in front of people.
I think beauty in particular is a 

1021
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,200
powerful force for that.
And that's,

1022
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:23,180
I mean,
when I've watched your videos really,

1023
01:00:23,181 --> 01:00:26,780
they are so beautiful that they,
they virtually bring me to tears.

1024
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,510
Aw.
Especially in combination with the music

1025
01:00:29,511 --> 01:00:30,344
because I'm very sensitive to music,
but you have this unbelievable capacity 

1026
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,120
for,
for grace and for color and for,

1027
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,133
and for deep respect for the music,
which I think is also really quite 

1028
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:43,124
remarkable.
Like your noi often see movies that use 

1029
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,280
good music,
but they don't have much respect for the

1030
01:00:49,281 --> 01:00:50,060
music.
They'll,

1031
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:51,020
they'll cut it,
you know,

1032
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:53,600
in the middle of a phrase or something 
like that.

1033
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,600
Um,
I remember the movie Magnolia was a real

1034
01:00:56,601 --> 01:00:58,690
exception to that,
that,

1035
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,600
that move uses music beautifully.
And a

1036
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:06,110
woody allen is very good at using music 
beautifully.

1037
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:07,190
And so is,
um,

1038
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:12,520
who is the director of the shining?
I'm Kimra Kubrick Kubrick.

1039
01:01:12,561 --> 01:01:13,011
Hey.
I mean,

1040
01:01:13,011 --> 01:01:15,580
he loves music and his,
his,

1041
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:16,443
his,
his,

1042
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:21,640
his work a clockwork orange has some of 
the same kind of perverse,

1043
01:01:21,861 --> 01:01:24,110
but that some of your animation has,
you know,

1044
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:24,953
because he,
he used those great beethoven pieces 

1045
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:28,293
that were,
that were transformed into electronic 

1046
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:35,050
music by Walter Wendy Carlos and uh,
and set these brutal scenes of mayhem to

1047
01:01:36,711 --> 01:01:38,420
beautiful music,
which was also,

1048
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,340
I think,
a very profound thing to do.

1049
01:01:40,341 --> 01:01:41,600
It kind of,
I mean,

1050
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:42,463
of course Germany is the home of 
Nazi-ism and it's also the home of 

1051
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,613
Beethoven and Bach and so you really 
can't separate those things in some 

1052
01:01:48,321 --> 01:01:50,960
sense and so,
okay,

1053
01:01:50,961 --> 01:01:53,630
so let's go to the copyright issue to 
some degree now.

1054
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:54,763
Now you're,
you're not a fan of the idea of 

1055
01:01:56,451 --> 01:01:57,830
copyright and,
and that's,

1056
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:02,660
that's interesting to me because it has 
been arguably a reasonably

1057
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:05,143
efficient way for people to,
let's say protect theft of they're 

1058
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,970
protecting themselves from theft if 
their intellectual property.

1059
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:12,343
Although I would say that's broken down 
quite badly now for people like 

1060
01:02:14,661 --> 01:02:18,260
musicians because their work is so 
distributable.

1061
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:19,663
Are you against copyright for all forms 
of intellectual property or why don't 

1062
01:02:23,971 --> 01:02:26,250
you tell us a little bit about your,
your ideas?

1063
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:29,180
Well,
you say that is if intellectual property

1064
01:02:29,181 --> 01:02:32,420
exists,
what is intellectual property?

1065
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:34,023
Well,
I guess to some degree I'll take the 

1066
01:02:35,411 --> 01:02:37,510
easy way out and say that's a legal 
issue,

1067
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:40,140
but I would,
you know,

1068
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:42,490
I would say that at least to some 
degree,

1069
01:02:42,491 --> 01:02:47,491
intellectual property is the consequence
of abstract work when you.

1070
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:50,883
Because it's,
it's certainly possible to work 

1071
01:02:52,031 --> 01:02:52,864
abstract,
deconstructing something like you're 

1072
01:02:54,191 --> 01:02:55,024
constructing your movies or perhaps a 
book and it seems to me that it's not 

1073
01:02:58,301 --> 01:02:59,134
unreasonable to propose that that 
deserves some of the same ownership 

1074
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,400
protection that a physical entity like,
uh,

1075
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:07,290
I'm not,
I'm not sure that there's,

1076
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:09,003
there's some level of similarity between
you owning your house and not allowing 

1077
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:16,750
other people then you owning the more 
abstract work that you've done.

1078
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:17,643
But I'm not,
and I'm certainly not attempting to 

1079
01:03:19,901 --> 01:03:22,460
engage you in an argument about the 
benefits of copyright.

1080
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:27,410
I presume that you have a very well 
thought through stance on s and m.

1081
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:28,463
well was it begins with.
It begins with acknowledging that 

1082
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:34,020
culture is not property.
It just didn't.

1083
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,930
And what we were just talking about a 
few minutes ago where,

1084
01:03:36,931 --> 01:03:38,530
where does this stuff come from?
You know,

1085
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:40,050
it comes from something bigger than 
ourselves.

1086
01:03:40,051 --> 01:03:41,290
We were just talking about,
you know,

1087
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:44,730
we do not actually originate this.
We certainly work,

1088
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:50,580
but I didn't originate any of the work 
that I'm putting out there.

1089
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:52,650
I mean,
I just stated it.

1090
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:55,230
Uh,
but we don't own children either.

1091
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:56,064
You know,
we let our children go out into the 

1092
01:03:57,031 --> 01:03:57,710
world.
If you,

1093
01:03:57,710 --> 01:04:01,290
if you want to own your child for 96 
years and you know,

1094
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:02,610
control everything,

1095
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:04,560
well then that serves you,
right?

1096
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:07,370
You get exactly what you deserve.
If I do that,

1097
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:10,640
you get a dead trial.
Basically you get a crippled,

1098
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,460
you know,
non human being.

1099
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,280
And the thing with cultural works is 
they,

1100
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:18,620
like I say,
I'm a fish swimming in there,

1101
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:19,790
you know,
it's like water.

1102
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:22,760
What happens when you enclose water?
It becomes stagnant,

1103
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:27,680
it becomes nasty,
it becomes toxic and you know,

1104
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:28,573
I know that for my own work it has to go
out in the world and it has to continue 

1105
01:04:32,721 --> 01:04:33,554
circulating and for me personally,
copyright interferes with that because 

1106
01:04:37,191 --> 01:04:38,750
you put a monopoly around something.
If,

1107
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:39,673
if I,
if one person or even if I am licensed 

1108
01:04:42,561 --> 01:04:45,620
my copyrights to others when when it's 
centrally controlled,

1109
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:49,130
it does not move.
And I did a lot of experiments.

1110
01:04:49,131 --> 01:04:49,964
The Sita sings the blues and by far the 
best way to get it into the world is to 

1111
01:04:54,771 --> 01:04:56,450
just let people carry it into the world.

1112
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,480
Great.
They have.

1113
01:04:59,150 --> 01:04:59,983
That's certainly what I've experienced 
as well and people are also taking more 

1114
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:04,493
lectures and cutting them into pieces,
which is not something I expected and 

1115
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,050
then putting up pieces of different 
length on,

1116
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:11,530
on,
um,

1117
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:12,630
on the,
on the net,

1118
01:05:12,631 --> 01:05:14,760
and I've had companies contact me and 
say,

1119
01:05:14,761 --> 01:05:16,080
you know,
for um,

1120
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,100
for a fee we'll more or less hunt

1121
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,740
these people down and it's forced your 
copyright.

1122
01:05:20,741 --> 01:05:22,210
And I thought,
well no one,

1123
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,193
I'm,
I'm more thinking about the message in 

1124
01:05:25,151 --> 01:05:28,450
the bottle approach to this and I'm 
willing to let go where,

1125
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:32,500
where it to let the wind blow where it 
wants to blow,

1126
01:05:32,501 --> 01:05:34,180
let's say he could put it that way

1127
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:35,383
and I'll say if you're making more money
that way because as you just pointed 

1128
01:05:37,991 --> 01:05:39,700
out,
people are sending,

1129
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:40,534
people want to support you,
they want to support you because they 

1130
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,920
actually see your work.
Right.

1131
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:48,460
If you were taking down all these,
all these instances of your work getting

1132
01:05:48,461 --> 01:05:51,670
seen because of copyright,
fewer people would see your work.

1133
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:55,510
The audience is the most efficient 
distribution machine that exists.

1134
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:56,483
It's definitely been a case for me and 
I've been fortunate too because I've 

1135
01:06:00,971 --> 01:06:01,804
been involved in some political 
controversy over the last year and some 

1136
01:06:04,811 --> 01:06:07,750
people that I know who,
who,

1137
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:09,363
who have been involved in say let's say 
broadly similar political controversies 

1138
01:06:13,271 --> 01:06:15,670
have been demonetized on Youtube,
you know,

1139
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:16,893
and I'm outside of that because 
everything I put up is free and people 

1140
01:06:21,101 --> 01:06:26,101
are perfectly willing to support me.
But I mean it's also very fortunate that

1141
01:06:26,581 --> 01:06:27,414
a new thing that this,
these new platforms for direct support 

1142
01:06:30,011 --> 01:06:33,130
of creative people let's say have just 
emerged and developed,

1143
01:06:33,131 --> 01:06:33,930
which is,
you know,

1144
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:34,763
thank,
thank God for that because it's very 

1145
01:06:35,801 --> 01:06:38,410
difficult for creative people to 
monetize their production.

1146
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:39,623
Yup.
So,

1147
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:41,020
so now.
All right,

1148
01:06:41,021 --> 01:06:41,790
so

1149
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:45,300
art is just to say something about more 
on this,

1150
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:46,140
you know,
with,

1151
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:46,973
with my films going out for free,
but benefit to me is that far more 

1152
01:06:49,921 --> 01:06:50,754
people see them that way than would see 
them if I were trying to control them 

1153
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,320
and trying to get people to pay me to 
see the thing.

1154
01:06:56,321 --> 01:07:00,540
So I made more money releasing sita,
sings the blues for free than I ever had

1155
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:03,330
before in my career where everything was
copyrighted,

1156
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:04,373
the consequences of all my comic strips 
being copyrighted is that people just 

1157
01:07:06,571 --> 01:07:08,730
don't see them.
So yeah,

1158
01:07:08,731 --> 01:07:11,430
so just releasing it as good,
but the other assets,

1159
01:07:11,431 --> 01:07:13,020
so that,
that's the benefit to me,

1160
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:14,303
uh,
the benefit to society is that you 

1161
01:07:16,591 --> 01:07:21,420
overcome like a form of societal brain 
damage when you ignore copyright.

1162
01:07:21,421 --> 01:07:23,970
And I gave a talk called copyright is 
brain damage.

1163
01:07:23,971 --> 01:07:25,740
You can look that up,
but if you,

1164
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:26,603
if you look at all of us are neurons and
a great mind and all of us transmit and 

1165
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:32,964
receive information,
copyright blocks that function or in an 

1166
01:07:36,751 --> 01:07:38,790
attempt to control that function.
I mean,

1167
01:07:38,791 --> 01:07:39,624
of course you can't,
you can't have a brain with totally 

1168
01:07:41,671 --> 01:07:43,200
uncontrolled,
you know,

1169
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:45,930
firing of sign apses,
that's madness.

1170
01:07:45,931 --> 01:07:50,520
But I really think that each human being
shares work that they love.

1171
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:55,650
So if you just let humans share work 
that they love and you know,

1172
01:07:55,651 --> 01:07:58,020
they naturally will not share work that 
they don't love,

1173
01:07:58,021 --> 01:08:00,210
then you end up with a really healthy 
system.

1174
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:01,463
And you know,
really good works are going to succeed 

1175
01:08:04,261 --> 01:08:05,094
in that system.
Whereas controlling things with 

1176
01:08:06,751 --> 01:08:07,584
copyright,
is this artificial damage to that 

1177
01:08:10,411 --> 01:08:10,800
system?

1178
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:11,633
Well there's also been a Sarah bit.
It's crooked tree in relationship to 

1179
01:08:14,241 --> 01:08:15,074
that.
In recent I would say perhaps Disney is 

1180
01:08:17,481 --> 01:08:20,300
more responsible for that than any other
organization,

1181
01:08:20,301 --> 01:08:21,134
you know.
And so it was Disney that was 

1182
01:08:23,091 --> 01:08:27,290
instrumental in getting copyright 
extended from 50 to 75 years.

1183
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:28,124
And I really did think that that was a 
form of crime because some of those 

1184
01:08:30,621 --> 01:08:31,454
early Disney movies and I would put milk
in that category particularly are are 

1185
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:39,860
incredibly culturally significant.
And to forestall

1186
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:44,300
a proper discussion of those cultural 
artists.

1187
01:08:44,301 --> 01:08:45,134
Alex I think is truly damaging.
And it was a travesty that that 

1188
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:50,120
copyright extension was granted

1189
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:52,820
over and over again.
And Disney is not the only one.

1190
01:08:52,821 --> 01:08:56,750
I mean most of our cultural heritage is 
controlled by five big corporations.

1191
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:57,973
Almost everything now.
I mean everything is owned by someone 

1192
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,390
and once it's owned it can be sold to 
someone else.

1193
01:09:02,391 --> 01:09:04,900
And it all ends up in the hands of,
you know,

1194
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:07,730
buy a calm and Sony everything.

1195
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:12,200
So now with regards to copyright,
do,

1196
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:17,180
do you draw a distinction?
What about patents and things like that?

1197
01:09:17,181 --> 01:09:19,160
Do you think that they are technically 
different?

1198
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:21,390
No,
I have a problem with patents,

1199
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:26,391
although my expertise is not in the area
of patents though the one legal concepts

1200
01:09:26,971 --> 01:09:29,160
that is classified as intellectual 
property,

1201
01:09:29,161 --> 01:09:33,720
which is a misnomer that is not 
completely fundamentally bankrupt.

1202
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:34,613
His trademark,
because the trademark theoretically has 

1203
01:09:38,611 --> 01:09:40,590
something to do with fraud and you know,
you need,

1204
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:43,920
you don't need or desire some mechanism 
to,

1205
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:47,760
to uh,
control or punished fraud.

1206
01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:51,290
So roof arc,
trademark alone would be that.

1207
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:52,124
It's not usually used that way.
It's usually abused is as much as 

1208
01:09:56,521 --> 01:09:59,610
anything under the intellectual property
label,

1209
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:00,863
but at least it has some.
You could make some excuse for it to 

1210
01:10:03,691 --> 01:10:04,524
exist.

1211
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:05,991
Right,
right.

1212
01:10:05,991 --> 01:10:06,890
So yeah.
Well,

1213
01:10:06,891 --> 01:10:07,611
I mean,
part of it,

1214
01:10:07,611 --> 01:10:10,700
I guess part of the claim for the 
protection of originality,

1215
01:10:10,701 --> 01:10:14,240
we might say it's also the protection 
you could argue for,

1216
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:17,060
for the,
for genuineness you don't like,

1217
01:10:17,061 --> 01:10:20,630
I might want to know that and maybe 
legal protection can help with this,

1218
01:10:20,631 --> 01:10:21,464
that I might want to know that the thing
that I'm watching or the thing that I'm 

1219
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:27,680
consuming is actually produced by the 
person who said that they produced it.

1220
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:29,810
So if I go on your website and I've 
watched it,

1221
01:10:29,811 --> 01:10:30,644
Nina Paley animated short,
I want to make sure that it isn't 

1222
01:10:33,201 --> 01:10:37,580
something someone copying you and using 
your identity as a,

1223
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:39,290
as a,
as a form.

1224
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:42,110
Well,
it's a form of parasitism essentially.

1225
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,273
So

1226
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,100
yeah.
But the thing is I don't,

1227
01:10:45,101 --> 01:10:48,260
I don't have a lot of need for that 
largely because I do free my work.

1228
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:53,520
So most people are aware of something 
that's by me is by me,

1229
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:54,860
the,
you know,

1230
01:10:54,861 --> 01:10:55,694
there's I guess some danger or the way I
might invoke trademark law is if 

1231
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,033
somebody edited something of mine,
everyone's welcome to edit and 

1232
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:07,304
redistribute it.
But if they said that the edit and 

1233
01:11:09,141 --> 01:11:11,180
redistribution was mine,
it was like,

1234
01:11:11,181 --> 01:11:11,920
no,
you know,

1235
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,890
like,
like the work I did is mine.

1236
01:11:13,891 --> 01:11:17,340
But you have to take responsibility for 
that edit and redistribution.

1237
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:19,830
I'm not responsible for your edit and 
redistribution.

1238
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:24,060
So if they add some message to it that 
is not mine,

1239
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,133
I don't want that attributed to me.
And I suppose I could invoke trademark 

1240
01:11:30,571 --> 01:11:32,740
or something to do that,
I don't know.

1241
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:35,370
Something,
but really would do is just go and say,

1242
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:36,450
Hey,
I never said that.

1243
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:38,343
Yes.
Well that's a lot simpler than engaging 

1244
01:11:39,611 --> 01:11:43,960
in legal battles were roughly the 
equivalent of a fairly serious disease.

1245
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:46,970
Yes,
I took a legal valid nonviolence.

1246
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:49,880
I don't want that system.

1247
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,113
Yeah,
well it's certainly a way of keeping 

1248
01:11:51,901 --> 01:11:54,600
your life simpler and unless,
you know,

1249
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:55,434
unless you get attacked by something 
that's truly malevolent and of course 

1250
01:11:57,721 --> 01:11:59,760
that can happen from time to time.
Okay.

1251
01:11:59,761 --> 01:12:00,594
So let's go back to your masochism.
So it's going to come out in 2018 and 

1252
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,620
I'm,
I'm very much looking forward to that.

1253
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,200
Yes,
I bet.

1254
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:11,760
Okay.
So we're a couple of things is,

1255
01:12:11,761 --> 01:12:14,720
um,
you know,

1256
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:17,310
it's so interesting because when I watch
your,

1257
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:19,260
your shorts,
I,

1258
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,673
I,
I remember a couple of them that have 

1259
01:12:22,441 --> 01:12:23,274
Moses wandering through the desert with 
the pillar of light leading him on and 

1260
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:29,610
cloud pillar of cloud.
Yes,

1261
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:30,540
that's right.
That's right.

1262
01:12:30,541 --> 01:12:31,321
The cloud.
Yes.

1263
01:12:31,321 --> 01:12:32,154
And,
and you've animated that very 

1264
01:12:33,361 --> 01:12:35,880
interesting way and it's got a kind of 
grandeur as well,

1265
01:12:35,881 --> 01:12:36,714
which,
which again spoke to me of something 

1266
01:12:38,401 --> 01:12:40,830
approximating a profound religious 
sensibility,

1267
01:12:40,831 --> 01:12:45,831
which is partly why I was
surprised by your comments about the,

1268
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:47,023
let's say,
the intellectual effect of your 

1269
01:12:47,971 --> 01:12:50,760
endeavors on your,
on your relationship with belief.

1270
01:12:50,761 --> 01:12:51,594
But

1271
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:55,830
this is the ego,
the ego talk.

1272
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:56,770
Well,
you know,

1273
01:12:56,770 --> 01:13:00,060
I think now and then we managed to make 
it a muse to muse talk.

1274
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:02,920
Well maybe a little bit,
but maybe a little bit.

1275
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:05,020
You're going to hear from my ego.

1276
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:06,470
Yes,
yes,

1277
01:13:06,471 --> 01:13:08,270
yes.
Well that's always the danger in talking

1278
01:13:08,271 --> 01:13:10,030
to artists,
right?

1279
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,290
Because I think generally when you speak
with artists,

1280
01:13:12,291 --> 01:13:13,124
you speak to the inferior part of them,
not because their ego is inferior 

1281
01:13:17,001 --> 01:13:17,834
compared to the ego of other people.
But because the part of them that you 

1282
01:13:21,051 --> 01:13:21,884
would like to communicate with is 
actually the part that's generating the 

1283
01:13:23,901 --> 01:13:26,630
art already doing it's communication.

1284
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:28,400
Exactly.
That's why I would rather,

1285
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:29,463
I mean in general it's like I speak 
better through my art than any other or 

1286
01:13:32,471 --> 01:13:34,520
an amendment anymore,
right?

1287
01:13:34,521 --> 01:13:39,521
It's whatever by his Dick Expressions,
my talking head.

1288
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:42,910
Yes.
Yes,

1289
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,330
absolutely.
Absolutely.

1290
01:13:44,331 --> 01:13:45,164
And I mean,
part of the reason I wanted to do the 

1291
01:13:47,031 --> 01:13:47,864
interview though was to find out what 
your ego thinks of all of this as well 

1292
01:13:50,991 --> 01:13:53,810
as to take the opportunity hopefully to 
bring your work to,

1293
01:13:54,050 --> 01:13:56,690
to perhaps do some people who don't know
about it yet.

1294
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,350
And okay.
So now you're making this magnificent,

1295
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:01,593
a production about exodus and about the 
old testament and that's a pretty 

1296
01:14:05,061 --> 01:14:07,640
strange thing to do.
Let's say in the modern world,

1297
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:13,930
what do you have any sense of what 
you're hoping that will accomplish?

1298
01:14:13,931 --> 01:14:14,764
I know,
I know that you want to launch it and 

1299
01:14:16,091 --> 01:14:19,030
see what happens and that there's 
curiosity associated with that,

1300
01:14:19,031 --> 01:14:21,640
but.
But do you have.

1301
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:22,863
Do you have a hypothesis or a theory 
about what it is that this is doing in 

1302
01:14:28,121 --> 01:14:28,954
the broader sense,
how you're contributing to the cultural 

1303
01:14:30,731 --> 01:14:31,570
conversation?

1304
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:36,910
I,
I'm sure that I do.

1305
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:39,880
I can't access those thoughts right now.
Uh,

1306
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:43,360
but I'll learn a lot more once it,
once it goes out.

1307
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:44,513
All right.
We'll sort of focus it a bit more in 

1308
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,120
the,
in the Pinocchio Movie,

1309
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:52,360
of course.
Mrs. Very ancient theme in order for the

1310
01:14:52,361 --> 01:14:56,050
puppet Marionette,
whose strings are being pulled by forces

1311
01:14:56,051 --> 01:14:59,620
beyond his control.
In order for him to become real,

1312
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:01,600
there's a variety of things he has to 
do.

1313
01:15:01,601 --> 01:15:04,960
He has to learn to tell the truth and he
has to learn not to be a neurotic victim

1314
01:15:04,961 --> 01:15:08,710
and he has to learn not to be an 
impulsive pleasure seeking,

1315
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:13,780
uh,
a victim of totalitarian processes,

1316
01:15:13,781 --> 01:15:14,614
all of those things.
But then he asked to go down to the 

1317
01:15:16,331 --> 01:15:19,180
bottom of chaos itself and rescue his 
father.

1318
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:22,900
I can't help but think that that's part 
of what you're doing.

1319
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:24,910
I mean,
you said it yourself in the interview,

1320
01:15:24,911 --> 01:15:25,744
right?
Because you said that you were 

1321
01:15:27,311 --> 01:15:28,144
attempting to make some connection with 
the belief of your father and to make 

1322
01:15:30,581 --> 01:15:35,050
some sense out of it and so you are in 
fact going into the void,

1323
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:35,943
let's say,
to rescue your father from the belly of 

1324
01:15:38,681 --> 01:15:41,170
the whale and,
and you know,

1325
01:15:41,171 --> 01:15:43,620
it seems to me that we're in a period 
of,

1326
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:44,783
of chaotic instability in our culture 
that it actually has a fair bit of 

1327
01:15:48,161 --> 01:15:48,994
danger associated with it and that I've 
felt a strong impulse to go back to 

1328
01:15:52,961 --> 01:15:57,961
these original stories to find out what 
they are and to establish them,

1329
01:15:58,631 --> 01:15:59,464
to reestablish them,
let's say his foundation or whatever 

1330
01:16:01,361 --> 01:16:02,270
that might mean.

1331
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:03,453
It might be my imagination,
but it seems to me that that's 

1332
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:06,994
associated,
that that's akin in some sense to what 

1333
01:16:09,311 --> 01:16:10,690
you're doing with exodus.

1334
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:12,310
Well,
yes,

1335
01:16:12,311 --> 01:16:16,210
and when I set out,
I did set out to connect to my father,

1336
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,650
your rescue,
my father.

1337
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:22,720
Uh,
but what I have learned in the past year

1338
01:16:22,721 --> 01:16:27,721
is that actually I'm looking for my 
mother and I think I found her.

1339
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:30,640
Okay.
Well now,

1340
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:34,270
now obviously I'm going to have to ask 
you to elaborate on that.

1341
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:37,310
I don't know if I can in words,
right,

1342
01:16:37,311 --> 01:16:39,710
like it's still in the process of doing 
this,

1343
01:16:39,711 --> 01:16:44,711
but it's like,
it's like I have been seeking to connect

1344
01:16:45,741 --> 01:16:47,750
with this,
this father,

1345
01:16:47,751 --> 01:16:51,410
this God the father,
and also my own father,

1346
01:16:51,411 --> 01:16:53,450
which I didn't have the best connection 
with.

1347
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:54,530
Nothing,
you know,

1348
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:58,280
nothing really terrible or anything,
just never really connected with him.

1349
01:16:58,281 --> 01:17:00,080
And I,
I've longed for that,

1350
01:17:00,081 --> 01:17:00,914
right?
Like a lot of my life because the 

1351
01:17:01,851 --> 01:17:05,300
culture tells me that that's really 
important,

1352
01:17:05,301 --> 01:17:06,060
you know,
like,

1353
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:11,060
and all the,
all the psychologists say,

1354
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:12,830
oh,
I need a really important thing.

1355
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,390
So my whole life it's been like,
oh,

1356
01:17:14,391 --> 01:17:16,150
you know,
maybe I,

1357
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,440
I wouldn't be messed up about this or 
that thing.

1358
01:17:18,441 --> 01:17:19,274
Maybe this is a daddy issue.
Now I gotTa get right with my dad even 

1359
01:17:22,941 --> 01:17:24,110
though he's,
he's dead.

1360
01:17:24,111 --> 01:17:26,360
And I'm just like looking and looking 
there and it's like,

1361
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:29,060
wait,
I missed something,

1362
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:30,470
right?

1363
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:33,560
Like it's my mother.
It's not,

1364
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:34,633
it's all of our mothers.
And you talked about the original 

1365
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:38,280
stories.
You referred to the Old Testament texts,

1366
01:17:38,281 --> 01:17:40,040
the original stories.
Well,

1367
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:41,660
they're not,
you know,

1368
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:46,690
we have most of the history of human 
religion was not these stories as far as

1369
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:56,410
as far as I have read or learned.
The early human conception of the divine

1370
01:17:56,601 --> 01:17:57,434
was female everywhere and we have broken
the connection to that and actually the 

1371
01:18:02,241 --> 01:18:03,074
story of exodus to me,
what it is is it's the solidifying of 

1372
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:08,203
the that change that it was a long 
gradual process of moving from goddess 

1373
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:18,770
to gods and Goddesses to just God just 
one God,

1374
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:23,990
but I'm reaching further back and I 
realize,

1375
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:24,933
you know,
when I.

1376
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:29,980
When I found that and when I started 
working with that earlier religion where

1377
01:18:30,741 --> 01:18:35,180
we have no text for it,
all we have is some artifacts,

1378
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:36,103
many artifacts from all over the world 
and beautiful symbols and of course 

1379
01:18:39,081 --> 01:18:41,960
there's a book by Eric Newman,
the great mother,

1380
01:18:41,961 --> 01:18:45,510
which talks about all the symbols
book.

1381
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:48,110
I read that sucker cover to cover

1382
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:49,670
that.
You read the origins.

1383
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:52,280
Have you read the origins and history of
consciousness?

1384
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:54,680
I have eight by Norman.
I have not,

1385
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,080
but I did.
I would highly recommend,

1386
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:00,080
but let me just,
I'm with you.

1387
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,210
I liked the other.
He writes like a lead weight.

1388
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:03,373
Uh,
it was just good to immerse myself in 

1389
01:19:04,881 --> 01:19:07,400
that.
So definitely that is what I was longing

1390
01:19:07,401 --> 01:19:09,080
for.
And back to the Old Testament.

1391
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:10,273
Those things are in the Old Testament.
They're all portrayed as the other and 

1392
01:19:14,121 --> 01:19:17,180
the enemies and what we're trying to 
stop out,

1393
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:19,520
but they're in there.
So,

1394
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:23,030
so in that way I relate to the Old 
Testament,

1395
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:27,350
not the heroes of the Old Testament.
Moses and Aaron and them.

1396
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:30,410
I,
I take

1397
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:36,470
inspiration from the stiff necked people
now it's like,

1398
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:37,570
oh,
it's too stiff.

1399
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:39,070
Neck people.
They're disobedient.

1400
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,820
Yes.
That's great.

1401
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:42,030
You know,
those are the,

1402
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:44,120
if there's,
if there's any history to this,

1403
01:19:44,121 --> 01:19:44,954
which there probably isn't,
but it's like those are the ones I'm 

1404
01:19:46,881 --> 01:19:49,020
descended from,
the bad one.

1405
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:51,003
Um,

1406
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:54,420
what was the,
I don't know,

1407
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:55,423
it's interesting because in the 
Pinocchio Story and in the classic 

1408
01:19:58,961 --> 01:19:59,794
stories of,
of journeying to the belly of the whale 

1409
01:20:01,931 --> 01:20:02,764
or journeying into the underworld,
it's often but not always males who are 

1410
01:20:06,371 --> 01:20:08,020
doing it.
And the farther,

1411
01:20:08,021 --> 01:20:08,854
and it isn't obvious to me 
psychologically what happens when a 

1412
01:20:11,311 --> 01:20:12,144
woman goes to the underworld to rescue 
her father isn't clear what she's going 

1413
01:20:15,421 --> 01:20:17,260
to discover their,
you know,

1414
01:20:17,261 --> 01:20:19,270
when it seems to me that you're,
you're,

1415
01:20:19,670 --> 01:20:22,620
you're,
you're using your creative pseudopods to

1416
01:20:22,621 --> 01:20:25,710
sort of feel out that territory and 
discover what might be there.

1417
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:30,490
So that seems very important too,
because obviously there's,

1418
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,620
there's a problem in our culture and the
problem is how,

1419
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:39,680
what is exactly the relationship between
femininity and women and these,

1420
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:44,490
let's call them patriarchal religions.
I mean there's,

1421
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:45,030
you know,
one of,

1422
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:48,060
one of your criticisms of,
of Christianity.

1423
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:51,060
And of course this is also evident in 
Eric moments work,

1424
01:20:51,061 --> 01:20:53,610
is that there's,
there's a trinity,

1425
01:20:53,611 --> 01:20:55,410
obviously Christianity,
let's say,

1426
01:20:55,411 --> 01:20:56,244
and it's a fairly comprehensive.
Well there's God the father and that's 

1427
01:20:58,501 --> 01:20:59,334
tradition and there's the Holy Spirit 
and that you might think about that is 

1428
01:21:02,071 --> 01:21:05,860
the news.
And there's God in the Sun Forum,

1429
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:06,694
which is,
you know,

1430
01:21:06,730 --> 01:21:07,563
you take human being who's,
who's vulnerable and mortal and who's 

1431
01:21:10,831 --> 01:21:11,664
destined to live on earth,
that those are nice elements of the 

1432
01:21:13,861 --> 01:21:14,694
divine.
But there's a missing fourth as far as 

1433
01:21:16,670 --> 01:21:17,503
you're concerned and he thought about as
sometimes constituted by the figure of 

1434
01:21:20,941 --> 01:21:22,980
Satan,
so that was where evil standard,

1435
01:21:22,981 --> 01:21:26,840
but also sometimes constituted by 
femininity itself and,

1436
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,910
and that,
those two things were often conflated as

1437
01:21:29,911 --> 01:21:32,580
well because they were the other.
And um,

1438
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:38,250
and that is a complicated technical 
problem because it's not obvious,

1439
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:42,900
it's not precisely obvious what the 
divine model is for women,

1440
01:21:42,901 --> 01:21:46,110
especially now that they have control 
over their reproductive function because

1441
01:21:46,111 --> 01:21:50,490
they're sort of half women in the 
traditional classic biological sense.

1442
01:21:50,491 --> 01:21:54,680
Half the email,
but also in some sense half male freedom

1443
01:21:54,730 --> 01:21:55,010
now

1444
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:57,740
control over the reproductive function.
Sadly.

1445
01:21:58,070 --> 01:21:59,720
I mean if we lived in that world we 
could,

1446
01:21:59,810 --> 01:22:01,370
we could talk that way,
but it's.

1447
01:22:01,371 --> 01:22:02,630
No,
practically speaking,

1448
01:22:02,631 --> 01:22:03,530
women really don't.

1449
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:08,140
Well because of it.
You mean because it's unreliable?

1450
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:10,560
Well,
for one thing,

1451
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:11,423
uh,
are you talking about like a hormonal 

1452
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:15,000
pills?
Birth control?

1453
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:17,200
I'm talking about birth control pills.
Well,

1454
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,650
like I can't take them right?
Like they,

1455
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:22,290
you know,
they have horrible side effects for me.

1456
01:22:22,291 --> 01:22:23,880
I'm quite a few women.
Yes,

1457
01:22:23,881 --> 01:22:25,800
definitely.
So it's not like,

1458
01:22:25,801 --> 01:22:26,330
it's not like,
oh,

1459
01:22:26,330 --> 01:22:28,020
we invented this pill.
I mean,

1460
01:22:28,021 --> 01:22:31,310
that's actually one of the,
that's like a great example of,

1461
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:33,570
you know,
our Patriarchal Society,

1462
01:22:33,571 --> 01:22:35,610
right?
Like that could be developed for men.

1463
01:22:35,611 --> 01:22:36,444
Men wouldn't tolerate the side effects 
and back they weren't developing a pill 

1464
01:22:39,451 --> 01:22:40,284
like that for men.
And then they cut the experiments short 

1465
01:22:41,701 --> 01:22:42,480
because men weren't,
uh,

1466
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:43,313
weren't tolerating the side effects,
which were worse than the side effects 

1467
01:22:46,021 --> 01:22:46,854
for women.
But women are going to tolerate that 

1468
01:22:48,061 --> 01:22:51,550
shit because they're just,
yeah,

1469
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:56,750
we're physically more vulnerable anyway.
It never ends all the old.

1470
01:22:57,690 --> 01:22:59,580
This is why I believe from biological 
reality.

1471
01:22:59,581 --> 01:23:02,570
By the way,
this is what biological materialist just

1472
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:06,340
because regardless of my identity,
regardless of my ideas,

1473
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:10,120
you know,
every month I'm doubled over in pain and

1474
01:23:10,290 --> 01:23:11,123
you know,
having like very real consequences of 

1475
01:23:14,111 --> 01:23:15,480
bright of my biology.

1476
01:23:15,530 --> 01:23:16,040
Well,
you,

1477
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:19,910
you just did a short about the great 
mother and now you know,

1478
01:23:19,911 --> 01:23:20,744
I wondered if you had read a book when I
saw that because I know there's 

1479
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:24,993
[inaudible] that,
that is an absolutely great book and as 

1480
01:23:26,481 --> 01:23:27,314
I said,
I would recommend or just history of 

1481
01:23:28,671 --> 01:23:29,650
conscious.
Obviously it's,

1482
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:31,273
I think it would help answer some of the
questions that you were talking about 

1483
01:23:33,651 --> 01:23:35,140
today.
I believe you.

1484
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:35,991
Yeah.
So,

1485
01:23:35,991 --> 01:23:36,824
and you know,
it was the book that you said he wished 

1486
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:39,374
he would have written,
which is hell of a thing for someone 

1487
01:23:41,571 --> 01:23:44,180
like him to say because he was a 
remarkable genius.

1488
01:23:44,181 --> 01:23:45,600
And so,
um,

1489
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:46,963
so,
so I guess that the new film and what's 

1490
01:23:51,171 --> 01:23:53,090
it called when the feature is the great 
mother

1491
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:54,133
godmother.

1492
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:55,420
Yes,
exactly.

1493
01:23:55,421 --> 01:23:56,254
And so is that now that seems 
importantly related to this issue that 

1494
01:23:59,411 --> 01:24:03,850
you brought up about rediscovering the 
connection with your mother going to.

1495
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:04,993
Yeah,
yeah.

1496
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:08,070
My actual mother,
the mother,

1497
01:24:08,430 --> 01:24:09,780
the great mother,
right.

1498
01:24:10,490 --> 01:24:12,840
I live with my actual mother.
She great and everything,

1499
01:24:12,841 --> 01:24:17,841
but we're on a metaphorical.
Yeah.

1500
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:19,783
And that,
that actually is the first scene of 

1501
01:24:22,621 --> 01:24:23,454
sadomasochism.
So I did the last scene first and then 

1502
01:24:25,171 --> 01:24:28,560
it took years for me to figure out what 
the first scene is.

1503
01:24:29,310 --> 01:24:34,290
So That's interesting and there's gonna 
be no introduction and no explanation.

1504
01:24:34,291 --> 01:24:35,124
It's just,
that's gonna set the stage for the 

1505
01:24:37,891 --> 01:24:39,660
exodus story.
Is that,

1506
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:40,653
that follow?

1507
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:46,980
Thank you for talking with me.
Thank you for being with me.

1508
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:48,540
I think that,
uh,

1509
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:53,490
I wish you the best of luck with your 
film and I hope that exactly what should

1510
01:24:53,491 --> 01:24:54,324
happen with it will happen and I'm going
to steal liberally from your films to 

1511
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:01,500
illustrate this interview if you don't 
mind,

1512
01:25:01,501 --> 01:25:04,620
and I'll try to be very respectful and 
careful with the editing.

1513
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:07,780
Excellent.
But actually be copying not stealing.

1514
01:25:07,950 --> 01:25:09,530
Oh yes.
Okay.

1515
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:12,190
Well thank you very much.
It was a pleasure talking with you.

1516
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,510
Thank you.
Likewise.

1517
01:25:13,570 --> 01:25:15,070
All right.
Bye.

1518
01:25:15,071 --> 01:25:15,904
Bye.
