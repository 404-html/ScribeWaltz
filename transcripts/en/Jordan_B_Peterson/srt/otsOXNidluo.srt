1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,200
If you don't have a goal,
you suffer.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,960
And then you get cruel and bitter and 
resentful and then you start to actively

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,620
try to make the world a worse place.
And so,

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,483
so because you can't suffer pointlessly 
without becoming bitter and you can't 

5
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:16,690
become bitter without becoming cruel.
So you need an eight.

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,350
The question is then the question.
You should David.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,850
Yeah,
yeah.

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,540
Better aim,
that's for sure.

9
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,800
So then the question is,
what's your dream?

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,673
Hmm.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,650
Welcome everyone.
Back to the school of greatness podcast.

12
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:46,380
We've got the legendary Jordan Peterson 
in the house.

13
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:47,400
Good to see us,
sir.

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,840
Good to see it.
Very excited about this.

15
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:51,330
You've got a book out called 12 rules 
for life.

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,820
Makes you guys check this out.
You've probably already got it,

17
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:54,654
but if you don't,
I'm telling you to go pick it up right 

18
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:57,840
now.
An antidote to chaos.

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,393
Uh,
you've had so much attention over this 

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,993
last couple of years and I've been 
digging into the research and just been 

21
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,330
fascinated by everything that you've 
been up to.

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,720
And I just love your stance on the 
vision you have for humanity in terms of

23
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,010
how we can all live better lives.
And I think you simplify a lot of things

24
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:17,844
in this book,
which some things people don't like to 

25
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:22,680
simplify.
I like to complicate.

26
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,653
Hmm.
And I think that's what's gotten you a 

27
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:28,560
lot of attention is that you try to 
really simplify a lot of these things.

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,860
I try to make everything concrete so 
that it's actually implementable.

29
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:32,843
Right?
I mean there's a lot of high level 

30
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:34,404
abstractions in the book because it 
ranges up into the theological and 

31
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,380
philosophical,
but it's always grounded in what you can

32
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:41,214
actually do in your life practically.
You want to bridge that gap from the 

33
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:45,024
highest steps,
traction down to the lowest level of 

34
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:48,450
behavior so that it becomes 
implementable.

35
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,420
And that's how philosophical concepts 
take on their meaning.

36
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,740
Right?
Cause they have to,

37
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,933
they have to have some impact on the way
you see the world in the way you act in 

38
00:01:56,071 --> 00:01:58,000
the world.
Or they're not fully realized,

39
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:00,630
they're not understood.
Because partly what we mean,

40
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:03,180
I would say when we say that we 
understand something,

41
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,410
it's kind of a state strange phrase to 
understand something,

42
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:12,411
but it means to be able to embody it in 
a shift of view and a shift of action.

43
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,120
And then you've got it.
It's graspable,

44
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:17,850
it's in your hand and body.
Something in a shift of view,

45
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,810
mother.
Well they're the same thing because your

46
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:22,644
perceptions are very tightly linked to 
your actions because of course when 

47
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:25,464
you're acting,
you're aiming at something you have to 

48
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:29,730
be devoted towards some,
some,

49
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,530
some aim,
some target,

50
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,600
right?
We play that out in sports all the time.

51
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:34,434
Yeah.
That's why sports are so entertaining 

52
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:37,710
for people is because they dramatize the
idea of aim,

53
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,110
right?
And then not only of aim,

54
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:43,800
but of the pursuit of excellence in 
pursuit of that aim.

55
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:44,843
That's the game.
And the reason it's a spectacle and the 

56
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:47,724
reason that people participate in it is 
because it dramatizes something 

57
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:50,754
absolutely essential about life.
And so you want to take philosophical 

58
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,490
abstractions and you want to use them 
to,

59
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,940
to structure your aim and then your 
perceptions organize around that aim.

60
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,280
And then you act it out and then you've 
got it.

61
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:04,280
That's then,
then it's,

62
00:03:04,281 --> 00:03:06,730
it's become part of your life.
It's not just an,

63
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:07,843
it's just,
it's not just a philosophical 

64
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:09,634
abstraction that floats free in space.
Why is there so much conflict in the 

65
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:14,554
world?
Is it because there's so many different 

66
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:18,550
perceptions that people have what they 
think should be,

67
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:19,930
right?
Well,

68
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:20,764
part of it is part of it.
Of course there's conflict because we 

69
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:23,704
have real problems.
And so life is actually difficult 

70
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,350
independent of the,
of psychological foolishness,

71
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:32,950
let's say independent of the obstacles 
that we put in our own path,

72
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,750
like this judge,
it's already,

73
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,180
it's already fatally challenging.
Right?

74
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,400
Life is the ultimate challenge.
We will die.

75
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,360
Yes,
yes,

76
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,380
there is.
Well,

77
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,760
a challenge.
Yes.

78
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,440
Well,
fear,

79
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,161
pain,
all those,

80
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:46,060
yes,
all the things,

81
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,953
all,
everything that goes along with 

82
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:49,120
suffering is a challenge.

83
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,721
And it's,
it's,

84
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:52,930
it's the full challenge because it takes
everything you have.

85
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,273
And so part of the reason we disagree is
because there are complex problems to 

86
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:58,264
solve.
And then we also disagree because we're 

87
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:02,710
willfully blind and because we're more 
ignorant than we should be.

88
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:03,544
And we're not everything we should be.
And we tilt towards malevolence from 

89
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:08,800
time to time and we betray each other 
and ourselves.

90
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:12,280
And so we take a bad lot in many ways 
and make it worse now.

91
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:14,380
Not always obviously,
and we don't have to,

92
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:17,110
but that's sort of the baseline that 
we're working against.

93
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,083
And I think people are most disappointed
in life when they're disappointed in 

94
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:22,990
themselves.
You know,

95
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:25,510
they see that they've made things worse 
than they had to be,

96
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:28,450
even though the baseline can be pretty 
brutal.

97
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,943
So yeah.
And so the book and all my lectures I 

98
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:34,060
suppose are,
are,

99
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,163
are put forward in an attempt to take 
the high level philosophical 

100
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:38,794
obstructions and to make them into 
something that's actionable and to take 

101
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,514
the next best action in your life,
improve your life so we don't have to 

102
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:46,630
suffer as much while.

103
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,480
And hopefully also so that people around
you don't have to either.

104
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,883
So one of the things I've been talking 
to my audiences about is the 

105
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:55,960
relationship between responsibility and 
meaning,

106
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,000
which is,
what would you say?

107
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:00,370
It's a,
it's a constant refrain in the book.

108
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:02,520
It's one of its underlying,
um,

109
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,023
messages let's say,
or themes is a better way of thinking 

110
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:08,210
about it.
Um,

111
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,933
you know,
if you start with the presumption that 

112
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,610
there's a baseline of suffering in life 
and that that can be exaggerated by as a

113
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:18,634
consequence of human failing as a 
consequence of malevolence and betrayal 

114
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:22,084
and self betrayal in dc to know all 
those things that we do to each other 

115
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:26,770
and to ourselves that we know that 
aren't good,

116
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:27,604
that amplifies the suffering.
That's sort of the baseline against 

117
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:31,450
which you have to work.
And,

118
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,383
and,
and it's contemplation of that often 

119
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,424
that makes people hopeless and depressed
and anxious and overwhelmed and all of 

120
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:38,410
that.

121
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,060
And,
and,

122
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,510
and they have the reasons,
but you need something to put up against

123
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:44,344
that.
And what you put up against that is 

124
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,223
meaning,
meaning is actually the instinct that 

125
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,340
helps you guide yourself through that 
catastrophe.

126
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,410
And most of that meaning is to be found 
in the adoption of responsibility.

127
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,340
So if you think,
for example,

128
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:59,174
if you think about the people that you 
admire while you think about when you 

129
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,610
have a clear conscience first,
cause that's a good thing to aim at,

130
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,380
which is something different than 
happiness,

131
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:07,730
right?
Um,

132
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,650
a clear conscience is different than 
happiness.

133
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,513
Yeah.
It's better.

134
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,970
Yeah.
That's better guilting yourself.

135
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,780
You're not feeling bad about your Isas,
right?

136
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,930
You feel that you've justifying,
you've justified your existence,

137
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,793
right?
And so you're not waking up at three in 

138
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:20,714
the morning in a cold sweat thinking 
about all the terrible things that 

139
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:23,264
you've involved yourself in what you 
said to someone that you shouldn't have 

140
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:26,270
said,
or my,

141
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,210
you acted or lie the opportunity you 
lost or,

142
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:29,991
or,
or,

143
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:30,770
or yeah.

144
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,780
Or,
or the things that you've,

145
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,260
that you've let go that you should have 
capitalized on and all of that.

146
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,060
And so if you think about the times when
you're at peace with yourself,

147
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:43,640
with regards to how you're conducting 
yourself in the world,

148
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:47,270
it's almost always conditions under 
which you've adopted responsibility,

149
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,310
right?
At least the most,

150
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,430
the most guilt I think that you can 
experience perhaps is the sure knowledge

151
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:55,694
that you're not even taking care of 
yourself so that you're leaving that 

152
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:00,800
responsibility to other people.
Cause that's pretty pathetic.

153
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,500
And I,
unless you're psychopathic and you know,

154
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:05,700
and,
and you're living a parasitical life and

155
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,603
that,
that as a very small minority of people 

156
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,150
and an even smaller minority think 
that's justifiable.

157
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,930
But most of the time you're in guilt and
shame because you're not,

158
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,663
you're not,
not only are you not taking care of 

159
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:19,611
yourself,
let's say,

160
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:20,444
so someone else has to,
but you're not living up to your full 

161
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:24,050
potential.

162
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,960
And so there's an existential weight 
that goes along with that.

163
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,880
So as you suffer even more,
when you don't take care of yourself and

164
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:34,700
take the best actions or do the work 
that you know you can do,

165
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,360
and you rely on someone else to support 
you financially,

166
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:39,560
emotionally,
physically,

167
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:40,520
whatever you know,
home,

168
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:41,440
whatever it may be.
Yeah.

169
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:42,590
Well,
cause you're not only,

170
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,110
you're not only not being what you could
be,

171
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:47,870
you're interfering with someone else 
being what they could be.

172
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:48,561
Right.
So you're,

173
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:50,390
you're,
you're not only a void,

174
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:53,300
you're a drain Jesus.
That's a catastrophe.

175
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:56,870
And we usually don't even know when 
we're in that situation cause we're in a

176
00:07:56,871 --> 00:07:59,540
depressed state or where or we don't 
want to see it.

177
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,673
You know,
you wake up at three in the morning and 

178
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:03,170
you know,
and so,

179
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:04,004
and then you think of the people that 
you admire yourself or perhaps you can 

180
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:10,310
at least live with yourself when you're 
taking responsibility,

181
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,930
at least for yourself.

182
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,393
And so that settles your conscience.
But then if you look at the people that 

183
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:20,720
you spontaneously admire,
and so the act of spontaneously admiring

184
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:24,140
someone is the manifestation of the 
instinct for meaning.

185
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:24,980
Right?
So,

186
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,813
and this is partly why people are so 
enamored of sports figures because the 

187
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:29,954
sports figures are playing out.
The drama of attaining the goal of 

188
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:35,000
attaining a certain kind of,
let's say,

189
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,000
psychological and physical perfection in
pursuit of the goal.

190
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,983
That's the drama.
And to spontaneously admire that is to 

191
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:42,464
have that instinct for meaning latch on 
to something that can be used as a 

192
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:45,884
model.
And then that model should be 

193
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:49,460
transcribed into something that's 
applicable in life.

194
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,623
You know,
and you really like to see in an 

195
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:52,484
athletic performance.
You really like to see someone who's 

196
00:08:54,021 --> 00:08:55,870
extremely disciplined and,
and,

197
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,730
and in shape,
do something physically remarkable but,

198
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,773
and,
and to stretch themselves even beyond 

199
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:03,054
their previous exploits because you 
really like to see a brilliant move in 

200
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,780
an athletic match.

201
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:07,883
But you also like to see that person 
ensconced in a broader moral framework 

202
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,773
so that not only are they trying to win 
and disciplining themselves in pursuit 

203
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,264
of that victory and then stretching 
themselves so they're continually 

204
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:23,190
getting better,
but they're doing it in a way that helps

205
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:24,024
develop their whole team.
And that's good for the sport in 

206
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:26,454
general.
And that reflects well on the broader 

207
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:29,610
culture,
a great leader and their team.

208
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,444
They're positive,
they're good sportsmen and against the 

209
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:35,040
competitors and not negative towards the
other people.

210
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,620
They're lifting them up to like the 
ultimate.

211
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,300
That's right.
That's right.

212
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:40,134
So that they can,
they can work for their own improvement 

213
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:42,294
in a way that simultaneously works for 
the improvement of their team and that 

214
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,650
and,
and for the sport and while,

215
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:47,484
and then to the degree that that spills 
over into the broader culture so much 

216
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:50,660
the better.

217
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,690
So that's all being dramatized in a,
in an athletic event.

218
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,360
And it's really,
it's not philosophical,

219
00:09:57,361 --> 00:09:58,370
it's concrete,
right?

220
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,590
It's dramatized in the world and that's 
what the game's represent.

221
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,240
And so,
well,

222
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,780
and it's partly because,
well in some sense life is a game.

223
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,810
It is,
it's in that you're always,

224
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,260
the analogy is that in in life,
like in sports,

225
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,850
you're,
you're,

226
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,893
you're setting forth the name and then 
arranging your perceptions and your 

227
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:23,220
actions in pursuit of that and that you 
also,

228
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,063
we generally do it well,
cooperating and competing with other 

229
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:26,634
people.
So that's also the game like element as 

230
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,540
well.
All of that's dramatized in athletics.

231
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,600
That's like philosophy for people who 
aren't philosophical.

232
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,640
And I'm not being smart about that 
tonight.

233
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:36,474
It's like it really is philosophy for 
people who aren't being philosophical 

234
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,130
cause it's played out.
You know,

235
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,630
and you can see it too.

236
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:47,220
You can see the spontaneous appreciation
for the human spirit manifest itself.

237
00:10:47,221 --> 00:10:51,090
When you see people rise to their feet 
spontaneously in a sports arena,

238
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:53,700
when they see someone do something 
particularly remarkable,

239
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,773
see an athlete who's extremely trained,
stretch themselves beyond what you'd 

240
00:10:58,441 --> 00:10:59,274
think is a normative human limit and 
everyone celebrates that like 

241
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,430
spontaneously.
So it's quite something to behold.

242
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,493
And so talking back to responsibility 
and meaning when we're watching sports 

243
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,463
or someone to do this act,
what does this do for us with in terms 

244
00:11:13,201 --> 00:11:14,940
of responsibility and meaning?
Well,

245
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:15,330
it,
it,

246
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,163
it,
it helps us figure out what we can 

247
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:20,070
imitate.
Gives us a model.

248
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,193
It's a model as a model of something 
that I respect while even what 

249
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:28,980
philosophy is or even theology for that 
matter is an abstract model.

250
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,870
Like it's laid out in words.
Now the problem often is,

251
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:32,704
is it becomes so abstract that people 
don't know how to bring it back down to 

252
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:35,850
total embodiment.

253
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,040
Yes.
Whereas something like,

254
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,630
like the drama of a sports event is sort
of midway between philosophy and action,

255
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:43,500
right?
It's so it's,

256
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,310
it's not entirely abstracted because 
it's not only coded in words,

257
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,353
it's acted out visual.
You can see an example of what just 

258
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:53,650
happened and you can try to reverse 
engineer how they feel that,

259
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,060
yes,
exactly.

260
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:56,170
Well,
at least you,

261
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,400
the fact that you admire the person 
means that you might start to try to act

262
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:01,234
like family.
Now it's not easy and maybe that would 

263
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:03,784
mean maybe that would mean that you 
start to discipline yourself with 

264
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:06,574
regards to a particular sport,
but it might also be that you start to 

265
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:12,010
mimic or at least affected in some way 
by their,

266
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,360
their sportsman sportsman like behavior,
right?

267
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,980
Which is the ground of a certain kind of
ethic.

268
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:20,140
Because if you can play well with 
others,

269
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,540
which is sort of the hallmark of a good 
sport,

270
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,703
then that actually means that you're a 
reasonably sophisticated and civilized 

271
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:27,040
person.

272
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,950
It's really important to learn to play 
well with others.

273
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,933
There isn't.
That's the ground of ethics and you can 

274
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:35,410
do it there and that's setting.
Then hopefully you can translate it into

275
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:36,190
like,
well,

276
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,360
right.
That's exactly right.

277
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,220
That's my goal.
That's what you hope for,

278
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:39,611
right?
Yeah.

279
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:41,860
That's the goal of this.
So if the,

280
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:46,180
if the goal of the game is to put the 
ball through the ball into the net,

281
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,433
then the goal of having games is to 
produce people who can take proper aim 

282
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:52,600
no matter where they are.
Right.

283
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,610
That's exactly what we're trying to do 
with,

284
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:55,211
with,
with,

285
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:56,950
with athletics.
So,

286
00:12:56,951 --> 00:12:57,970
um,
uh,

287
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,430
so I've been talking to my audiences a 
lot about that,

288
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:01,264
about Andy Weil,
and there's more to it too because if 

289
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,420
the background of life has,
is there's a,

290
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:08,254
there's an ineradicable component of 
suffering and that's complicated by 

291
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:12,274
let's say malevolence and the proclivity
of people to be trade themselves and 

292
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:15,490
others,
which,

293
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,480
which complicates it makes it worse then
the,

294
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,780
if you don't have a noble aim and,
and,

295
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,380
and if that isn't imbuing your life with
sustainable meaning,

296
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,110
then you fall prey to all the 
catastrophe,

297
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:33,100
the pain and the anxiety and the anger 
that that's suffering generates.

298
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,933
And that makes you bitter.
Because what I'm hearing you say is 

299
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,310
that,
and correct me if I'm wrong,

300
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,050
we must have an aim in our life,
no matter what stage of life we're in.

301
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:44,943
And if we don't have some type of aim,
even if for a few months of an aim of 

302
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:49,420
going somewhere,
direction,

303
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,883
we're going to,
suffering is going to be even more 

304
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:53,610
suffering.
Pointless,

305
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,430
because we're already going to face the 
greatest challenges,

306
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,720
right?
You're stuck with 30 struggling.

307
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,120
That's right.
There's no way of diversity is coming no

308
00:14:01,121 --> 00:14:01,980
matter what.
That's right.

309
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,350
We have big goals or small little goal 
or whatever it may be,

310
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:09,970
but it's going to be the less suffering 
if we have an aim.

311
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,040
Yeah.
Well not only that,

312
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,730
it's worse than that even because the 
suffering is zero,

313
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,541
meaning,
well,

314
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,810
the suffering is pain and the suffering 
is anxiety and uncertainty,

315
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:21,160
and the suffering is hopelessness.

316
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,650
But the consequences of all that is that
you get bitter.

317
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,023
And when you get bitter,
you get mean and you get cruel and you 

318
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:29,680
start to hurt yourself and other people.
So it's not only that,

319
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:31,720
if you don't have a goal,
you suffer.

320
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:33,700
It's that you,
if you don't have a goal,

321
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,683
you suffer.
And then you get cruel and bitter and 

322
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:37,324
resentful,
and then you start to actively try to 

323
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:41,020
make the world a worse place.
And so,

324
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:41,883
so because you can't suffer pointlessly 
without becoming bitter and you can't 

325
00:14:45,821 --> 00:14:49,080
become bitter without becoming cruel.
So you need an ame.

326
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,770
And the question is then the question,
of course you should aim.

327
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,240
Yeah,
yeah.

328
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,010
Better aim,
that's for sure.

329
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,580
So then the question is what should you 
name be?

330
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,863
And we have a program.
It's one of the things I wanted to talk 

331
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:01,580
to you about today.

332
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,413
I,
I have this website called self 

333
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:08,060
authoring.com and that program helps 
people write about their life.

334
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,060
And so there's a past authoring program 
to,

335
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,350
to,
to establish your aim.

336
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:13,184
You have to know where you are.
It's like you're trying to orient 

337
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,544
yourself on a map.
You can't Orient Yourself on a map 

338
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:19,124
unless you know where you are.
You'll also have to know where you're 

339
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:21,081
going.
Right?

340
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:23,660
So those are the two relevant things.
The past,

341
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:26,650
our three program helps people write 
about their lives.

342
00:15:26,651 --> 00:15:27,484
So it's a guided autobiography.
We asked people to break their life up 

343
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:34,130
into six epochs,
six sections and then to write about the

344
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:39,131
emotionally important events in those,
in those epochs and to detail out why,

345
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,270
why the positive things happen and why 
more of that could conceivably happen in

346
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:45,104
the future and to detail out why the 
negative things happened in to try to 

347
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:51,380
understand why with a name,
to not replicating them in the future.

348
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,710
Because the purpose of memory isn't to 
remember the past.

349
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:55,963
The purpose of memory is so that you,
you figure out what went wrong when 

350
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:02,450
something went wrong so you don't 
duplicate it in the future.

351
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,303
So that's the purpose of memory and the 
past authoring program can help people 

352
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,124
catch up and you know,
you have to catch up if you have 

353
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:10,274
memories that are older than about a 
year and a half that still cause you 

354
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:16,160
emotional pain when you think about them
or if you dwell on them,

355
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:18,890
they come spontaneously back to mind.
It means you haven't,

356
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,460
it means that there's part of your life 
that you haven't mapped out properly and

357
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:24,560
it still has emotional valence that's 
gripping.

358
00:16:24,561 --> 00:16:27,790
You should that story or it's still 
holding on to you,

359
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,153
right?
Go,

360
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,901
yeah,
yeah.

361
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:32,090
Well you haven't been able to navigate 
your way through it.

362
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,133
There's a pitfall there that you fell in
and you don't know how to avoid similar 

363
00:16:36,531 --> 00:16:37,364
pitfalls in the future,
and that's why your brain won't let it 

364
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:40,574
go.

365
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,680
Cause it's saying that's what the 
anxiety systems do.

366
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:44,360
It's like this happened to you.
It wasn't good.

367
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:45,410
This happened to you.
It wasn't good.

368
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:46,550
This happened to you.
It wasn't good.

369
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,520
Fix It,
fix it,

370
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,440
fix it,
fix it.

371
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,600
That will never go away unless you fix 
it.

372
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,650
How do you fix it?
Well,

373
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:53,900
you have to figure out why it happened.
Right?

374
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:55,580
That's the first thing is like how did 
you,

375
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,360
how was it that that situation arose to 
pull you down?

376
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,160
And that's not simple.
That's why.

377
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,113
Well,
that's why we have the writing program 

378
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,520
because it's complicated to think 
through,

379
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,400
but you,
but if you face it and you,

380
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,260
and you meditate on it,
let's say and say,

381
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,103
and you do this voluntarily,
there's a pretty high probability that 

382
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:16,820
you'll be able to decrease the 
probability that will be repeated in the

383
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:18,110
future.
So

384
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,110
go ahead.

385
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,050
I don't want to say,
oh well,

386
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,213
well we,
that the second part of the program 

387
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:26,960
helps people do an analysis of their 
virtues and their faults.

388
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,893
Same sort of idea.
What's good about you that you could 

389
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:33,770
capitalize on what's weak about you that
you need to fix so that it doesn't bring

390
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:34,970
you down.
Right?

391
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,833
And that's the present or three.
But the future authoring program is 

392
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,624
probably most relevant to you and your 
listeners because you're interested in 

393
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:42,554
helping people establish aims.
And so we already talked about the fact 

394
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,260
that you need an aim in life or,
or that's where you derive your meaning.

395
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:51,420
And without that,
things go to hell.

396
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,270
And,
and as literally as that can be taken.

397
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,020
And so,
but it's not easy to ask people to say,

398
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,303
well,
it's easy to ask them what do you want 

399
00:18:00,971 --> 00:18:01,804
in your life?
It's a very hard question to answer 

400
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,940
cause it's too vague and grantee.

401
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,400
So we help in the future authoring 
program,

402
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:10,080
we help people break that down.
So,

403
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:10,830
okay,
so here's,

404
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,663
here's the situation.
So you put yourself in the right frame 

405
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:15,780
of mind.
So what's the right frame of mind?

406
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,340
It's like rural too.
In this book,

407
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,100
treat yourself like you're someone 
responsible for helping your,

408
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,210
someone that you are responsible for 
helping.

409
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:28,470
So what that means is you have to start 
from the presupposition that despite all

410
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:31,920
your flaws and insufficiencies that it's
worth having you around.

411
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,290
And that it would be okay if things were
better for you.

412
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,363
So you need to take care of yourself 
like you're taking care of someone you 

413
00:18:37,261 --> 00:18:38,094
care for.
So there's a bit of a detachment in 

414
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:41,760
that.
And then the next thing is,

415
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:43,830
okay,
so now look three to five years down the

416
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,311
road.
Okay.

417
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:45,144
You get to have what you need and want,
assuming you're being reasonable and 

418
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:48,504
that you actually want it to means 
you're willing to make the sacrifices 

419
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:52,920
that would,
that would make it possible.

420
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,630
What do you mean by reasonable?
Well,

421
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:56,010
that that's,
that's the next thing.

422
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,630
Well,
within your grasp,

423
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,320
that would be something is out of your 
grasp,

424
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:06,470
but you still push hard enough,
then you need an incremental plant,

425
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,873
right?
You need to break that goal down into 

426
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:11,070
steps.
Phrase goal within a year.

427
00:19:11,071 --> 00:19:11,940
That's like,
yeah,

428
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,740
I haven't even done the work to mass 
riskily yet.

429
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,150
Yeah,
I got it.

430
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah.
Well that's it.

431
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:18,420
And you can have a high end goal and 
more power to you if you do need it.

432
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,070
Well,
you need a pathway to it.

433
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:24,540
If it's 10 stories up above you,
you need a staircase to get there.

434
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,403
Right?
And so you have to build the staircase 

435
00:19:26,401 --> 00:19:29,430
to,
and so in the future authoring program,

436
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:30,540
so you're asked,
first of all,

437
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,170
okay,
here's,

438
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,530
you get to have what you want and need.
That's the proposition,

439
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,940
but you have to imagine it.

440
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,200
You have to define it,
name at it.

441
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,880
So,
so then the first thing is,

442
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:39,714
okay,
um,

443
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,260
if you could put your family together 
the way you wanted it to be,

444
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:44,094
what would that look like?
And so that might be your siblings and 

445
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:48,000
your parents,
but that also might be,

446
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,070
you know,
your wife or your husband and your kids,

447
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:50,904
assuming that you're at that point in 
your life could have the family you 

448
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:55,110
wanted.
What would that look like?

449
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,393
Right.
Okay.

450
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,170
Career,
same thing.

451
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,320
You get to have the career or the job 
that that is within your grasp necessary

452
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,820
and,
and suitable for you.

453
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:08,370
If you were taking care of yourself,
how are you going to educate yourself?

454
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:09,840
Because you're not as smart as you 
should be.

455
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,610
There's lot more things you need to 
know.

456
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,130
So you gotta keep learning and moving 
forward.

457
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:15,120
So you need to plan for that.

458
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,940
How are you going to take care of 
yourself mentally and physically?

459
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,193
Right?
So,

460
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,810
um,
how are you going to avoid that?

461
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,330
The catastrophic temptations for 
example,

462
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:25,164
of drugs and alcohol because that pulls 
a lot of people doubt and you need a 

463
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:28,830
plan for that.
You're going to be a social drinker.

464
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:30,750
How much are you going to drink?
How much is too much?

465
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:31,703
What about your drug use?
Got to regulate that so it isn't a 

466
00:20:33,631 --> 00:20:34,464
pitfall.
How are you going to use your time 

467
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:39,180
meaningful and productively outside of 
work is needed to plan for that.

468
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,523
So that's um,
there's one other that that's a fixed 

469
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,070
mindset,
right?

470
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,903
Yeah.
I think there are seven initial 

471
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:47,530
questions and I don't,
I don't remember the one,

472
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,850
um,
oh,

473
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:51,400
intimate relationship of course.
So you have,

474
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,980
do you want,
do you want to longterm stable,

475
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:54,814
intimate relationship and if you do then
how would you like that to lay itself 

476
00:20:57,911 --> 00:20:58,350
out?

477
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,300
You got to have vision for that because 
if you don't have a vision,

478
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,550
you're not going to aim at it.
And if you don't aim at it,

479
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:06,010
then you won't even see the 
opportunities when they arise.

480
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,010
That's the thing that's so cool.
I wrote about this in chapter 10,

481
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:09,844
which is be precise in your speech.
It's a chapter about the fact that ame 

482
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,660
structure your perceptions.
So for example,

483
00:21:16,661 --> 00:21:19,210
once you aim at something,
your brain,

484
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,103
literally that perceptual structures in 
your brain and your visual cortex 

485
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:23,554
reorient themselves to calculate a 
pathway to the ame and then what they 

486
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:30,000
show you in the world is obstacles to 
that path and,

487
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,133
and open pathways to the path.
That's actually how the world reveals 

488
00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:34,360
itself.
Just like,

489
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:39,810
just like when you're driving in a car 
and you have a map and you or you aim at

490
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:40,714
a particular place,
then all the things that are related to 

491
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:43,474
that place show up in the world,
it's exactly the same thing because you 

492
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:48,550
are traveling through time and space,
right?

493
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,590
And you need a map.
And so,

494
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,160
so after you answer these seven 
questions and you're encouraged to do it

495
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:57,220
badly because you don't have to get 
perfectionistic,

496
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,360
just complete it,
right?

497
00:21:58,361 --> 00:22:02,170
Because a bad plan is better than no 
plan gives you something to improve.

498
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:05,980
So even if your aim is vague and even if
it's off target,

499
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,010
if you start aiming and you see you're 
off target,

500
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:11,020
then you can shift and you can make it 
more precise.

501
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,030
Start to recognize what you don't want 
in that.

502
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,900
Yes,
exactly.

503
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:15,100
Exactly.
I thought I wanted this,

504
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:16,000
but I don't,
sorry.

505
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,000
Let me re navigate and figure out what I
do.

506
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:19,750
Exactly and you to have to try a bunch 
of,

507
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,610
well you will have to,
you can be,

508
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:23,620
that's why you shouldn't get 
perfectionistic about it.

509
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,573
You will absolutely be wrong,
but you won't be as wrong as you would 

510
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:28,450
have been if you were aimless.

511
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,381
Right,
right.

512
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,840
So it's a,
so there's a bit of no man's land,

513
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:36,280
no man's land is norris.
Then go men's room is a bit worse than a

514
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:38,230
bad path.
That's exactly right.

515
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,600
Like that's a good one.
That's a good one.

516
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:41,770
And it's right.
It's right.

517
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,560
You don't want to be a no man's land.
Why did you use that phrase?

518
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,480
Because that's right.
That's exactly right.

519
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,343
I think
for me the idea of walking around 

520
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:54,370
aimlessly is like the worst idea in the 
world.

521
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,420
It's like zero purpose,
zero mission,

522
00:22:56,421 --> 00:22:57,254
zero certainty at all.
It's like walking around in no man's 

523
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:00,664
land right aimlessly.
But it's funny too because in no man's 

524
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:04,150
land,
everybody shooting at you.

525
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,000
All right?
Cause that's a military term in no man's

526
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:09,300
land is the space in the middle and the 
positions,

527
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,140
you bet.
So if you're aimless,

528
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,270
you're also at a place where everything 
is shooting at you.

529
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,000
So it's a very good metaphor that came 
to mind.

530
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,130
Yeah,
well that's why that worked on it.

531
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:19,180
That's very,
very cool.

532
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,250
So then we say to people,
okay look now,

533
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,740
okay,
now you thought about this for a while.

534
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,690
It's nice to do this over a couple of 
days too,

535
00:23:25,691 --> 00:23:28,450
because then you get to sleep on it and 
that helps reorient yourself.

536
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,710
So then,
okay,

537
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:32,130
now you write for 20 minutes.
Don't worry about grammar,

538
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,310
spelling.
This isn't a,

539
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,100
this isn't a composition exercise,
right?

540
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,800
You get to have what you want three to 
five years down the road.

541
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,230
What does your life look like?
Hypothetically?

542
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,460
Write it up.
Write it out.

543
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,290
Okay,
so then that's the first part,

544
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,124
the second part of exercise.
So now you've got your thing d that you 

545
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:47,961
think,
well,

546
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:50,300
I'm motivated because I got my thing.
Do you think they map?

547
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,183
It's like you're not as motivated as you
could be because you don't yet have you 

548
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:55,790
thing to run away from.

549
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,040
Because if you really want to be 
motivated,

550
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:01,760
you want to be going somewhere and you 
want to be not going somewhere else,

551
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:03,580
which typically is a pain,
right?

552
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,090
Yes.
Or pain or anxiety,

553
00:24:05,091 --> 00:24:07,670
yet some,
some domain of suffering and guilt.

554
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,650
I don't want to feel this anymore.
Yes,

555
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:10,940
exactly.
Exactly.

556
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,130
So,
so the other thing we ask people is,

557
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:13,964
okay,
now take stock of your weaknesses and 

558
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:16,784
imagine that you let them multiply.
You got hopeless and you ordered in and 

559
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:23,780
things were as bad for you as they could
be in three to five years.

560
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:26,840
What are some examples of weaknesses 
that people might have?

561
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,450
They lie,
they procrastinate,

562
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,990
they avoid their grandiose,
they're narcissistic,

563
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,850
they're undisciplined.
Uh,

564
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,010
there are nihilistic.
They're aimless.

565
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,810
All of those things,
right?

566
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,760
Um,
victim mentality.

567
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:42,120
They take the sh,
they take the,

568
00:24:42,121 --> 00:24:43,250
the,
the quick way out.

569
00:24:43,251 --> 00:24:44,960
They pursue and pleasures.

570
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,793
They sacrifice meaning for expediency.
They don't take care of their basic 

571
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:51,620
responsibilities.
They fight stupidly with their parents.

572
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:53,990
They don't,
they don't negotiate properly with their

573
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:54,824
spouse.
They are bitter at work because they 

574
00:24:56,271 --> 00:24:57,104
haven't said what they have to say.
They haven't thought through what 

575
00:24:59,061 --> 00:25:01,070
they're doing tomorrow.
They drink too much.

576
00:25:01,071 --> 00:25:02,930
They smoked too much.
They take too many drugs.

577
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:05,560
They don't regulate their there.
Yeah.

578
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,333
Everyone knows.
Everyone knows and everyone's got a set 

579
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,500
of weaknesses that they know about and 
so we say,

580
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:14,420
all right.
What are some of your weaknesses?

581
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,313
Like three weaknesses that you know 
right now you could still work on it in 

582
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,110
three things that you think are really 
well,

583
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:19,963
a lot of things.
A lot of things are things that I've 

584
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:24,110
taken care of in my life.
Like I used to smoke when I was a kid.

585
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:25,190
I smoked a pack a day.

586
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,980
I used to drink a lot.
I didn't work out like there,

587
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:28,843
there,
there I wasn't nearly as disciplined as 

588
00:25:30,351 --> 00:25:31,184
I should have been.
I wasn't just careful with what I was 

589
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:34,480
saying.
Like I,

590
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,083
and I,
I suppose my most likely negative 

591
00:25:38,151 --> 00:25:40,790
outcome probably would have been,
I really liked to drink.

592
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,470
Like alcohol was a really good drug for 
me.

593
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:44,780
I want you to do losses on that.
Um,

594
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,550
well partly it was mostly because the 
opportunity came up for me,

595
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,061
uh,
to,

596
00:25:50,061 --> 00:25:50,894
to investigate drug and alcohol use.
But I came from a little town in 

597
00:25:53,331 --> 00:25:55,350
northern Alberta.
It was a heavy drinking town and,

598
00:25:55,351 --> 00:25:56,530
uh,
and uh,

599
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,910
that,
that could have been a real trap for me,

600
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,120
you know,
and,

601
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:00,953
and,
and,

602
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,510
and so anyway,
so we have these PPC,

603
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,403
okay,
now you know your weaknesses and you 

604
00:26:06,351 --> 00:26:07,184
know,
what particular hell you would descend 

605
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:08,924
to if you allowed yourself to descend 
into it because you've probably had a 

606
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:11,840
taste of it.

607
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,673
It's like you really let that go and 
you're in a terrible place in three to 

608
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:16,970
five years because you haven't done what
you should do.

609
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:20,030
What does that look like?
It's like everybody writes that down.

610
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,320
Write it down.
So you know,

611
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:23,570
because one of the things you want to 
have behind you,

612
00:26:23,571 --> 00:26:24,890
let's say you have to do something 
difficult,

613
00:26:24,891 --> 00:26:26,930
like go confront your boss.
It's like,

614
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:28,940
well,
maybe hope isn't enough to encourage you

615
00:26:28,941 --> 00:26:30,350
to do that.
You think,

616
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:30,891
well,
no.

617
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:34,250
If I don't encourage,
if I don't go confront my boss carefully

618
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,630
and intelligently,
right,

619
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,870
then I'm going to hate my job and then 
I'm going to drink more.

620
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,680
Then I'm going to end up in that little 
hell place that I designed for myself.

621
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,291
It's like,
oh,

622
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:44,550
I'm not going there.
Well,

623
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:45,384
I don't want to talk to my boss or I 
don't want to confront my wife or my 

624
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:48,210
husband,
whatever it is,

625
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:50,610
or my father or my children's for that 
matter,

626
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,713
but if I don't,
then I'll resent myself or I'm going 

627
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:56,910
down this terrible pathway.

628
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,743
It's like,
because sometimes when you moving 

629
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:00,564
forward,
you have to do something difficult and 

630
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:02,490
you might think,
well,

631
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,970
why bother and answer is well,
so I don't end up in hell.

632
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,860
How about that?
Oh yeah.

633
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,170
Oh yeah,
there's that deep.

634
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,940
If you don't experience the pain now or 
the difficulty now,

635
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:16,680
you're going to have a deeper pain 
later.

636
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:17,161
Yeah.
Yeah.

637
00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:17,994
That's life.
Much deeper pain there and that's why I 

638
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:24,250
think at you mentioned at one point is 
like putting ourselves in um,

639
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,770
structured pain,
like structured in sense of feeling pain

640
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:31,080
throughout the day.
Whether it be the tough conversation,

641
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,060
I don't want to do that.
It's painful,

642
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:33,894
but I'm going to because I know 
afterwards it's going to probably feel 

643
00:27:36,811 --> 00:27:38,670
better.
It's a bit of a sacrifice,

644
00:27:38,671 --> 00:27:39,504
right?
So you sacrifice stability in the 

645
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:41,544
present for a gain in the future.
That's the big discovery of human 

646
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:44,634
beings.

647
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,400
Face works.
Were you a big athlete growing up?

648
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:48,300
No.
No,

649
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,030
but I know when I was a small kid and I 
just skipped the grade,

650
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,043
although I skied and I went cross 
country skiing and he didn't see 

651
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,220
individual sports things.
Mostly with my dad.

652
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,730
You understand that and in order to 
improve as an athlete or in any sport,

653
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,510
you have to put yourself through daily 
pain.

654
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,130
Yeah.
Right.

655
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:02,963
If you want to achieve that model of 
excellence that you watch someone 

656
00:28:05,611 --> 00:28:06,444
playing basketball as a child and you 
see someone living this model is going 

657
00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:15,411
to be 15 years of deliberate pain.
That's a discipline that's it worked out

658
00:28:15,751 --> 00:28:17,370
for a long time with weights,
you know,

659
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,030
so you know,
dealt it every day.

660
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,933
I didn't want to push through pain but 
you knew that would get you a greater 

661
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:22,631
result.
Yeah.

662
00:28:22,631 --> 00:28:24,510
Well and it's easier not to do it then 
to do it,

663
00:28:24,511 --> 00:28:25,530
but not in the long run.

664
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,233
You know,
I really seen the benefits for example 

665
00:28:28,711 --> 00:28:31,500
for weightlifting cause I've watched 
people cause I'm 58 50,

666
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,170
how old am I?
56 is a great,

667
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:34,004
you know what I'm seeing as I'm getting 
older and I really noticed the 

668
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:38,430
difference between people in when they 
age,

669
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,543
um,
between people who laid down a good 

670
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:44,310
physiological platform when they were 
young and those who didn't.

671
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,173
Because by the,
if you haven't worked out weights 

672
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:48,384
particularly I would say you start to 
get pretty soft in your thirties and 

673
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:54,090
your cardiovascular system starts to go 
and really early.

674
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,013
They all,
the other thing too is the best thing 

675
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:58,260
you can do to maintain cognitive,
uh,

676
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:01,560
ability isn't to do exercises like 
lumosity.

677
00:29:01,561 --> 00:29:03,780
It's not brain exercises that keep you 
sharp.

678
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,390
It's exercise.
So if you're 50,

679
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,060
both cardiovascular and weight lifting,
if you're 50,

680
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:09,894
you can restore your cognitive function 
to the level of a 30 year old through 

681
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:13,134
exercise,
your mental function through physical 

682
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:16,490
lights.

683
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,323
Yeah.
Well your brain is a very demanding 

684
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:19,104
organ.
And if your cardiovascular system is 

685
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:21,900
compromised,
then you get stupid.

686
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,131
And so,
yeah,

687
00:29:23,131 --> 00:29:25,560
it's really cool because as you move and
the bigger you get,

688
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:27,290
the more stupid you'd become.
Mm hmm.

689
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,830
Yeah.
Well,

690
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,753
you compromise,
you compromise its function because the 

691
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:32,750
brain is,
it's,

692
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,010
it's,
it's the organ that uses more.

693
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,170
It's,
it's very metabolically demanding.

694
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,890
And so if you're not in good physical 
shape,

695
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,380
then one of the things that suffers most
greatly as your cognitive function.

696
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,770
And so that's quite an interesting thing
to see how tight that linkage is.

697
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,410
So in the next part of the program,
we have people,

698
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,150
now it's okay,
now you've got your vision.

699
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,920
Yeah.
Even if it's a bad one,

700
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:54,460
it's,
yeah.

701
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,470
That's right.
What's better than no vision at all,

702
00:29:56,471 --> 00:29:57,880
right?
It's something that you could improve.

703
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,833
Well,
think you're trying to get through a 

704
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:02,650
territory you don't understand and 
here's your option.

705
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:03,603
No map a map that's not so good,
but has some things about it or a great 

706
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:10,750
map while obviously the great map is the
thing you want,

707
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:11,823
but the,
the map that something is way better 

708
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:15,070
than the map.
That's nothing.

709
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,940
Plus as you explore because of your map,
you can start to fill in the details.

710
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:21,320
You start to learn,
you just start to overcome stuff and you

711
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:23,900
start to master skills journey.
Right?

712
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,323
Yeah.
Well that's the other thing too is like 

713
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:26,944
let's say you,
you aim at something and you and you 

714
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:29,434
develop some skills along the way and 
then you get like a third of the way 

715
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:33,130
there and you think,
oh,

716
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,360
that's not for me.
It's like,

717
00:30:34,361 --> 00:30:35,051
well,
yeah,

718
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:35,884
fair enough.
But now you've still got the skills you 

719
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:38,554
developed.
You know exactly why it's not for you 

720
00:30:41,081 --> 00:30:43,490
now instead of vaguely don't have to 
keep going after that.

721
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,853
Exactly.
Well and you have a rationale and then 

722
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:50,380
you can bring that wisdom back even 
though it's not perfect,

723
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:51,214
you can bring it back to your next plan.
And so take responsibility for the next 

724
00:30:54,341 --> 00:30:55,030
steps.
Yes,

725
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,500
yes.
And so as you plan,

726
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:59,020
you get better at planning,
which is the crucial thing.

727
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,183
So,
so then we say to people will take your 

728
00:31:01,571 --> 00:31:05,650
pause division and make it into eight 
stateable goals.

729
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,543
Right?
So and then rank them in a hierarchy 

730
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,060
because you need to know what like a top
goal and then yeah.

731
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,150
And incremental goals.
Yeah.

732
00:31:12,151 --> 00:31:12,571
And,
and,

733
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:14,290
and that,
well that's the other thing is break the

734
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,124
goals into incremental goals so that you
have a reasonable probability of 

735
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:19,930
succeeding.
So cause what you want to do,

736
00:31:19,931 --> 00:31:21,640
this is also what you want to do with a 
kid.

737
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:25,930
You don't tell your kid,
here is an impossible thing.

738
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,973
Why don't you go out and fail?
You say here's something worth going 

739
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:30,934
after.
Here's the step you could take that 

740
00:31:32,411 --> 00:31:36,940
would push you beyond where you are,
but that you also have a reasonably high

741
00:31:36,941 --> 00:31:39,100
probability of succeeding yet.
Right.

742
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,740
They'd call that in a timeframe.
Within some time frame.

743
00:31:41,741 --> 00:31:44,050
That's the other thing.
You have to parameterize it with regards

744
00:31:44,051 --> 00:31:45,160
to timeframe.
That's right.

745
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,890
And that puts you in the zone of 
proximal development.

746
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:50,350
And that's a,
that's a concept that was generated by a

747
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:51,184
guy named [inaudible].
He was a Russian developmental 

748
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:53,764
psychologist and the smart one,
that's where the idea of the zone comes 

749
00:31:56,021 --> 00:31:58,600
from to be in the zone.
And when you're in the zone,

750
00:31:58,990 --> 00:31:59,823
you're expanding your skills at in a 
manner that's intrinsically rewarding 

751
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,390
because you're succeeding and so you 
want to set,

752
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,980
if you're good to yourself,
you think,

753
00:32:08,981 --> 00:32:10,210
okay,
I need to set a goal,

754
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,463
but I need to set a goal that someone is
stupid and useless as me could probably 

755
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:16,090
attain.

756
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,310
If they put some effort into it.
And then you've got,

757
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,173
then you've got it perfectly because 
it's not so high that it's grandiose or 

758
00:32:22,091 --> 00:32:25,990
impossible that you fail necessarily and
then justify your bitterness.

759
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,033
It's like,
well I could do well done cause that 

760
00:32:28,091 --> 00:32:30,000
happens to people all the time.
Yeah.

761
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,040
It's like,
it's like it's,

762
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,920
yes,
exactly.

763
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:34,490
While I set a goal and I didn't attain 
it.

764
00:32:34,491 --> 00:32:36,640
And so I'm not gonna set any more goal.
It's like,

765
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:37,474
no,
you set a goal that was inappropriate 

766
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,440
for the timeframe.
Yeah,

767
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,860
that's right.
You didn't calibrate it properly and you

768
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:43,694
were playing a trick on yourself because
you want it to fail so that you could 

769
00:32:45,651 --> 00:32:48,500
justify not having to try.
So I'm being a victim.

770
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,980
It's just helpful.
You're still going to be a victim.

771
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,990
It's like there's no way out of that 
man.

772
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:57,260
So you know,
because life is this life is a challenge

773
00:32:57,261 --> 00:32:59,180
that in some sense can be surmounted.

774
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,013
So there's no way out of your problem.
But there is certainly proper ways of 

775
00:33:02,901 --> 00:33:03,734
dealing with it.
Yeah.

776
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,460
And so you lay out those eight steps,
lay them out,

777
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,870
and then the next thing is,
okay,

778
00:33:08,871 --> 00:33:09,704
you need a rationale for them because 
you're going to have doubts and other 

779
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,700
gonna people are gonna put up obstacles.
Does that mean to me?

780
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,380
Is that a Mimi rationale?
Means A,

781
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,840
yeah.
Justification.

782
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:18,470
Yeah.
It's like,

783
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,520
okay,
so here,

784
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:22,730
what sort of justification is a good 
justification for your goals?

785
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,250
It's easy.
Why would it be good for you?

786
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,383
Okay.
Why would it be good for your family if 

787
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:28,904
you attain that goal?
Why would it be good for the broader 

788
00:33:30,471 --> 00:33:32,480
community?
Because if it's a good goal,

789
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,060
it should be good for you.
That's fine.

790
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,253
But if it's a really good goal,
it should be good for you in a way 

791
00:33:37,701 --> 00:33:38,750
that's good for other people.

792
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,941
Yes,
exactly.

793
00:33:39,941 --> 00:33:40,774
And you,
and if you're going to decide what your 

794
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:46,460
goals are,
why not set up the ones that benefit the

795
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,860
largest number of people simultaneous.
Yes.

796
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,773
If you can do that,
you should start with your own concerns 

797
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:53,720
cause you have to take care of yourself 
needs first.

798
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:55,880
Yes.
Put Your own oxygen mask on,

799
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,320
then put your child's oxygen mask on.
Yeah.

800
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,930
Right.
And then you can,

801
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,460
as you,
as you build up a,

802
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,443
the basis of competence locally,
you might develop enough skills so that 

803
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:06,584
you can expand that outward.
And it also gives your goal a certain 

804
00:34:08,961 --> 00:34:09,794
amount of nobility.
And so if someone challenges you and 

805
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:13,160
says,
well why are you doing that?

806
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:14,323
That seems stupid.
You could say I'm doing that because it 

807
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:18,860
helps me take care of myself,
but it benefits my family.

808
00:34:18,861 --> 00:34:19,694
And here's the reasons why,
and this is the repercussions out into 

809
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:22,790
the broader community.

810
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,893
And like people aren't,
people who are putting up objections in 

811
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:27,074
doubts aren't,
aren't armed to deal with that kind of 

812
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:29,984
response.
And then when you have those doubts in 

813
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:32,084
your mind that plague you,
which they go back to your reason to go 

814
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:37,130
back to your reasons why it's right to 
say,

815
00:34:37,131 --> 00:34:38,360
why,
why am I doing this?

816
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,320
Oh yeah.
It's because,

817
00:34:39,321 --> 00:34:40,154
well I have to take care of myself 
because otherwise I'm pathetic and 

818
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:45,410
useless and bitter and cruel and then 
I'm going somewhere terrible.

819
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:46,244
So that's a bad idea and here's how it 
would help my family and here's how it 

820
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:49,994
would help the community.
And that's good enough set of reasons 

821
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:53,420
for it unless I can think of better 
ones.

822
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,260
Right,
right.

823
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,940
Without better ones.
That's good enough.

824
00:34:55,941 --> 00:34:59,270
Because I think the question comes back 
to after,

825
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,313
you know,
someone could go down the rabbit hole 

826
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:02,121
and say,
why,

827
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:04,280
why am I doing this and why is this,
you know,

828
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,020
meaningful for me.

829
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,380
And I think a lot of people go back to 
a,

830
00:35:08,381 --> 00:35:09,810
why am I here on the first?
Yes,

831
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,780
yes.
Why am I here?

832
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,033
What is the meaning of my life?
And is this real or is this just some 

833
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,860
dreamworld?
Well,

834
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,873
and then in that,
then people do go back to that and then 

835
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,850
they get stuck on that.
Yeah.

836
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,873
What,
but none of this even matters because 

837
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,510
why am I even here?
Well,

838
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:27,603
the thing is,
is that that's a self defeating set of 

839
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:33,140
propositions in some sense because of 
the consequence of being stuck.

840
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:33,974
There is no reason you stuck there to 
begin with is because you're not very 

841
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:37,574
happy about the fact that life is 
intrinsically tied up with suffering 

842
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,450
because he wouldn't be asking that 
question to begin with.

843
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,673
Okay?
So if you let that pull you in and take 

844
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:46,680
you down,
all it does is make the suffering worse,

845
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,820
not helpful.

846
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:48,893
And then,
and then the cascade that we talked 

847
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:52,650
about happens.
You suffer stupidly and pointless.

848
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,690
You get bitter,
give cruel,

849
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,720
you make everything worse.
It's like that's your answer is it?

850
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,850
You're going to make everything worse.
It's bad enough,

851
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:03,480
you're going to make it worse.
Mostly people won't do that consciously.

852
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:04,951
So you think,
well,

853
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:06,120
what's the alternative?
Well,

854
00:36:06,121 --> 00:36:09,330
here's one.
If you have a sufficiently noble purpose

855
00:36:09,331 --> 00:36:12,120
to suffering will justify itself.
And I think,

856
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:12,983
I think that's empirically testable.
And I do believe it's the case because 

857
00:36:15,721 --> 00:36:16,554
I've watched people do very difficult 
things like people who work in 

858
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:19,344
Palliative care wards.
So all they're ever dealing with his 

859
00:36:21,361 --> 00:36:22,830
pain and death,
right?

860
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:25,440
And they can do it and get up in the 
morning,

861
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,600
they go to work and they take care of 
those people.

862
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:31,080
They lose people on a weekly basis.
And yet they can do it.

863
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,273
And what that shows is that if you turn 
around and you confront the suffering 

864
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:36,774
voluntarily,
you find out that you are way tougher 

865
00:36:38,551 --> 00:36:39,384
than you think.
It's not that life is better than you 

866
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:41,994
think.
Life is as harsh as you think it might 

867
00:36:43,741 --> 00:36:44,574
even be worse,
but you are way tougher than you think 

868
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,993
if you turn around and confronted.
And so then what you discover is that 

869
00:36:50,701 --> 00:36:53,070
there's a spirit within you that 
pursues,

870
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,510
that can pursue something meaningful 
that has the resilience and the strength

871
00:36:57,511 --> 00:37:02,070
to contend properly with the catastrophe
of existence without becoming bitter.

872
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,080
That's actually the central.
So,

873
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,293
and then I would say that's one of the 
central themes of 12 rules for life is 

874
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:08,514
that make no mistake about it.
Like the first noble truth of Buddhism 

875
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:12,683
life is suffering.
This is true and it's worse than that 

876
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:17,880
because it's suffering contaminated by 
malevolence.

877
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,530
That's the baseline.
But,

878
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:20,364
and so that's very pessimistic.
But the optimistic part is that you are 

879
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,324
so damn tough,
you can actually not only deal with 

880
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:26,810
that,
you can improve it.

881
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,850
It's like,
oh well that's a horrible situation.

882
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,190
But it turns out that I'm armed for the 
task.

883
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,620
Well that's,
that's a great thing for people to know.

884
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,573
And I do believe,
I think the fact that we're armed for 

885
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:42,621
the task is even more true than the fact
that life is catastrophe contaminated by

886
00:37:42,691 --> 00:37:45,720
malevolence.
We're stronger than things are terrible,

887
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,580
so hadn't,
things are pretty terrible,

888
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:50,010
so that means we're pretty damn strong.
Wow.

889
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,053
Yes.
It's a very good thing to know and it's 

890
00:37:52,621 --> 00:37:55,770
not naive optimism.
It's a very different thing.

891
00:37:55,771 --> 00:37:57,720
It's like no,
things are terrible.

892
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,060
They're brutal and you are so damn 
tough.

893
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,150
You can't believe it.
So wow.

894
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,043
What's,
what's been the biggest challenge in 

895
00:38:05,131 --> 00:38:05,964
your life that you've had to overcome or
the biggest suffering that took you the 

896
00:38:08,731 --> 00:38:11,070
longest to get beyond to improve?

897
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,130
Having them bring you down is not 
helping the person who has the problem.

898
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,000
It's the same with,
with my daughter.

899
00:38:37,001 --> 00:38:41,920
It's like had my wife and I deteriorated
as a consequence of her condition.

900
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,933
A,
that would have been horrible for her 

901
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:44,554
because then she would have had to bear 
the weight of watching her illness 

902
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:48,430
destroy her family.
Right.

903
00:38:48,431 --> 00:38:49,510
Which have that killed.
Oh,

904
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:50,620
Christ.
Yes.

905
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,513
I mean,
that's one of the terrible things about 

906
00:38:52,211 --> 00:38:55,390
having a,
a very bad illness is that not only does

907
00:38:55,391 --> 00:38:56,224
it do you in,
but you can see it taking its toll on 

908
00:38:58,451 --> 00:39:00,580
the people around you.
I think that might even be worse.

909
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,103
Hm.

910
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,980
Welcome everyone.
Back to the school of greatness podcast.

911
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,710
We've got the legendary Jordan Peterson 
in the house.

912
00:39:21,711 --> 00:39:22,730
Good to see you,
sir.

913
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,170
Good to see you.
And very excited about this.

914
00:39:24,171 --> 00:39:26,660
You've got a book out called 12 rules 
for life.

915
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:29,150
Makes you guys check this out.
You've probably already got it,

916
00:39:29,151 --> 00:39:29,984
but if you don't,
I'm telling you to go pick it up right 

917
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,200
now.
An antidote to chaos.

918
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:36,830
What's been the biggest challenge in 
your life that you've had to overcome or

919
00:39:36,831 --> 00:39:40,210
the biggest suffering that took you the 
longest to get beyond

920
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,400
to improve?
Oh,

921
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:43,234
I think that was probably,
I wrote about this in the last chapter 

922
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:47,730
of my book,
which is called Pedicab.

923
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,900
When you encounter one in the street and
it's about,

924
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,660
it's about dealing with,
you know,

925
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,503
when you think,
what's the worst thing that can happen 

926
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:54,940
to you?
Well,

927
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,043
I think the worst thing is that you do 
something really horrible and you screw 

928
00:39:58,031 --> 00:39:59,740
up your life in everyone's life around 
you.

929
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,780
If that's yes,
yes.

930
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,400
And you have to live with knowing you 
did it.

931
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,690
It's like that's rough,
man.

932
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,710
That's,
see it's worse.

933
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:06,920
Sky.
Yes.

934
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:11,020
Remember there are worse things than 
dying.

935
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,280
Yeah.
Yes there are.

936
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,420
No,
no,

937
00:40:13,421 --> 00:40:14,050
no,
that's,

938
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,740
that's that bad thing man.
But,

939
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,133
but I think the,
the hardest existential situation that 

940
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:23,630
I've been in is the situation with my 
daughter because she was very,

941
00:40:23,631 --> 00:40:27,740
very ill and she had rheumatoid 
arthritis,

942
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,870
she had arthritis,
it wasn't rheumatoid type.

943
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:34,450
And she had 40 affected joints that it 
started to bother her when she was two,

944
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,633
but really manifested itself fully when 
she was six and some of the medical 

945
00:40:39,921 --> 00:40:42,890
treatment help.
But when she was 15,

946
00:40:42,891 --> 00:40:45,140
14,
14 through 16,

947
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,900
um,
first her hip disintegrated.

948
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,250
Oh.
And then her.

949
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,233
And so she had that replaced after 
walking around on it for like a good 

950
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,103
year.
And then her ankle disintegrated on her 

951
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:57,200
other foot and she had to have yet 
replaced.

952
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:01,490
And so there were two years of 
absolutely brutal pain for her,

953
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:04,730
like brutal daily,
excruciating pain.

954
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,490
And,
and we were really running around trying

955
00:41:07,491 --> 00:41:08,324
to figure out what to do about it 
because the hip wasn't too hard to 

956
00:41:10,311 --> 00:41:11,420
replace,
you know,

957
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,080
because surgeons are actually pretty 
good at hip replacements,

958
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,750
but ankles are still so many bones.
Yeah.

959
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,240
Yeah.
And so,

960
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,130
and just watching that and,
and,

961
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,113
and while watching what it was doing to 
her because she was in enough pain at 

962
00:41:26,961 --> 00:41:28,730
one point,
it just about broker.

963
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:29,951
Yeah.
I mean,

964
00:41:29,951 --> 00:41:30,740
you know,
you and I,

965
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,573
you've probably been on a situation 
where you were in pain for a night and 

966
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:34,850
couldn't sleep.
It's like,

967
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:35,481
yeah,
fine.

968
00:41:35,481 --> 00:41:38,300
So multiply that by five and extended 
over two years.

969
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,610
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

970
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:44,210
And she was on like huge doses of 
opiates and so that was sedating her and

971
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:45,044
so that made it look drunk in public and
she can only stay awake for about six 

972
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:48,644
hours a day.
And she had to take Ritalin to stay 

973
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:51,790
awake because otherwise she was just 
sleeping all the time.

974
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,620
And it was a very bad auto immune 
condition.

975
00:41:54,621 --> 00:41:55,454
And so it wasn't the only manifest in,
in the juke joint deterioration and the 

976
00:41:59,001 --> 00:41:59,834
pain,
because arthritis is also very painful 

977
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,310
and 40 joints happens to be quite a lot.
So one joint was brewed.

978
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,183
Yeah,
right.

979
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,540
No,
it was absolutely brutal.

980
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:09,374
Beyond belief as a father or a parent,
how do you navigate that emotionally 

981
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,360
yourself?

982
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,190
Yeah,
well that's what that chapter's about.

983
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,090
I mean,
so,

984
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,580
so what do you do when,
when things are too much?

985
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:20,863
Well,
one of the answers is you narrow your 

986
00:42:23,211 --> 00:42:24,044
timeframe and now they're answer is you 
look for occasions of grace and beauty 

987
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:32,960
where you can get the swelling had a dog
that really helped,

988
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,513
you know?
So that was something that was with her 

989
00:42:35,811 --> 00:42:36,644
all the time.
And we tried to put things in her life 

990
00:42:38,271 --> 00:42:39,460
that,
that she,

991
00:42:39,461 --> 00:42:41,540
she could care for.
She had a whole raft of Pat's,

992
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:43,130
although she was allergic to almost 
everything.

993
00:42:43,131 --> 00:42:45,050
So most of them were lizards.
Yeah.

994
00:42:45,051 --> 00:42:47,000
I know.
Get her getting up.

995
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:48,471
He's like,
Oh,

996
00:42:48,471 --> 00:42:50,560
I love this Guinea pig.
And then,

997
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:51,663
you know,
three hours later she'd have a big 

998
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:57,140
round.
We take the Guinea big Bi Harry's dog.

999
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:58,723
So the dog,
luckily the dog she could tolerate and 

1000
00:43:00,561 --> 00:43:04,640
so we had the dog for her and,
but one of the things you do when you're

1001
00:43:04,641 --> 00:43:07,940
in a situation like that,
it's just a bloody ongoing nightmare,

1002
00:43:07,941 --> 00:43:10,460
is that you,
you shrink your timeframe.

1003
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:12,230
It's like,
well what are we going to do in a year?

1004
00:43:12,231 --> 00:43:13,130
It's like,
Oh God,

1005
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:15,530
we can't even think about that.
It's about six months.

1006
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,970
No,
yeah,

1007
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,610
a week tomorrow.
Today.

1008
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,860
The next hour.
Yeah.

1009
00:43:21,861 --> 00:43:22,694
So that's what you really do.
You shrink your timeframe until you can 

1010
00:43:25,131 --> 00:43:27,180
tolerate it.
So you're not planning out year.

1011
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:29,690
Cause then you'll go crazy.
There's too much uncertainty.

1012
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:30,591
You just think,
okay,

1013
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:33,320
how can I make the next hour the least 
amount of awful possible?

1014
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,210
That's what you do at someone's 
deathbed.

1015
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,450
You shrink your timeframe and that and 
that's what you have to do.

1016
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,280
How does that play into the,
uh,

1017
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,700
the self authoring program?
If you have this vision for yourself and

1018
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:45,140
you're mapping out a year,
two,

1019
00:43:45,141 --> 00:43:46,340
three,
five years ahead.

1020
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:47,280
Yeah.
Well sometimes,

1021
00:43:47,281 --> 00:43:48,220
you know,
navigate.

1022
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:49,101
Yeah,
that's right.

1023
00:43:49,101 --> 00:43:50,060
You have to read,
navigate.

1024
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,320
You have to say no,
fit it into that.

1025
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:54,110
Yeah.
Because even the best laid plans of mice

1026
00:43:54,111 --> 00:43:55,130
and men go astray.

1027
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,470
You know,
I mean that's part of being a lot and so

1028
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:59,100
you have your map,
but you know,

1029
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,090
if you get a flat tire along the way,
you still have to stop and fix your car.

1030
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,040
Maybe the bloody thing bursts into 
flames.

1031
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:06,260
You have to get a new car,
you know,

1032
00:44:06,261 --> 00:44:07,910
so I mean you're,
you're,

1033
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:12,680
you're asset towards your goals can be 
punctuated by unexpected catastrophe and

1034
00:44:12,681 --> 00:44:14,960
then,
well then hopefully you've made yourself

1035
00:44:14,961 --> 00:44:15,794
into a resilient person at that point.
And the catastrophe is no worse than it 

1036
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:22,580
has to be.
And you're not making it worse.

1037
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:23,623
I mean,
one of the things we were fortunate 

1038
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:27,860
about is that by the time she got really
ill,

1039
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:29,203
my,
my relationship with my wife was pretty 

1040
00:44:30,741 --> 00:44:33,450
well together and my relationship with 
my son,

1041
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:35,790
my,
who's younger than her was also well put

1042
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:36,624
together.
And so he was an absolute trooper men 

1043
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:39,143
because most of,
for a lot of his teenage life in 

1044
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:42,624
particular,
there was a huge amount of focus on the 

1045
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:45,690
suffering of his sister.

1046
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:47,580
And we were like right up to here with 
that.

1047
00:44:47,581 --> 00:44:49,020
It was just,
it was enough.

1048
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:53,010
And he conducted himself admirably.
He didn't,

1049
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,590
if he cause trouble,
we didn't know about it.

1050
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:57,180
He kept it to himself,
you know,

1051
00:44:57,181 --> 00:44:58,014
and I don't mean he was hiding.
I mean he dealt with it and he spent a 

1052
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:05,130
lot of time at home and he didn't do any
unnecessarily stupid things.

1053
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,143
And he put up with his sister and his 
parents who were on edge a lot without 

1054
00:45:09,421 --> 00:45:12,210
adding additional catastrophe and misery
and grief to it.

1055
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:16,380
And when she was a little bit crazy and 
was leaning on him too hard or bothering

1056
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:17,214
him,
he was there to support her and it was 

1057
00:45:18,511 --> 00:45:20,970
massively helpful.
And you know,

1058
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:21,804
I wasn't any more,
my wife and I weren't any more crazy 

1059
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:24,804
towards each other then we had to be.
And so there wasn't like any additional 

1060
00:45:29,191 --> 00:45:31,620
stress during those periods of time sunk
us.

1061
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:33,970
Any extra would have been like,
yeah,

1062
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:35,730
that's right.
That's right.

1063
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,260
How are you able to compartmentalize or 
just focus on your,

1064
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,080
your career at that time?
You know,

1065
00:45:43,081 --> 00:45:45,290
lecturing or writing or whatever it may 
be at,

1066
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:47,610
well that's also part of the vision of 
Hell.

1067
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:48,331
It's like,
well,

1068
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:49,164
what's the alternative?
You let things go and you make them 

1069
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:53,130
worse.
It's like not showing up and yeah,

1070
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,750
just don't know.
There's no excuse for that.

1071
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,730
It's like you can't you,
how did you say?

1072
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,830
Was there a con compartmentalizing of 
like,

1073
00:45:58,831 --> 00:45:59,664
okay,
it's nine o'clock or eight o'clock in 

1074
00:46:00,781 --> 00:46:03,310
the morning,
I'm going to work and then yeah,

1075
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,460
we made rules and we talked about some 
of them,

1076
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:06,294
like some of the rules were,
we didn't talk about my daughter 

1077
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,020
daughter's illness after eight o'clock 
at night.

1078
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:12,780
That was the rule.
It's like no sanity.

1079
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:14,760
Well,
it's a war.

1080
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,720
You wear yourself out in a week,
your dad and everyone suffers a lot.

1081
00:46:18,721 --> 00:46:21,240
So you've got to keep going through 
however long this is going to be.

1082
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:22,560
And so what?
What do you have to do?

1083
00:46:22,561 --> 00:46:23,394
What?
You have to sleep,

1084
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,130
you have to sleep or things are going to
go bad.

1085
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:27,511
Yeah,
that's right.

1086
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:29,730
It's time to stop talking and go to 
sleep,

1087
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,120
so you have to cut off.
Yeah.

1088
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:32,993
Well,
and I had learned some of that because 

1089
00:46:33,751 --> 00:46:34,584
I've been a clinical psychologist for a 
long time and so I've been dealing with 

1090
00:46:37,111 --> 00:46:39,630
people's problems and you learn how to,
you know,

1091
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:40,051
you think,
well,

1092
00:46:40,051 --> 00:46:43,110
how can you go home when when you have 
all of those problems to contend with,

1093
00:46:43,111 --> 00:46:43,590
it's like,
well,

1094
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:44,423
a,
they are not your problems not going 

1095
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:47,634
away right now and they're not going 
away and and having them bring you down 

1096
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,640
is not helping the person who has the 
problem.

1097
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:58,410
It's the same with with my daughter,
it's like had my wife and I deteriorated

1098
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,810
as a consequence of her condition.
A,

1099
00:47:00,811 --> 00:47:01,644
that would have been horrible for her 
because then she would have had to bear 

1100
00:47:03,511 --> 00:47:06,420
the weight of watching her illness 
destroy her family.

1101
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:07,740
Right.
We'd have that guilt.

1102
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,581
Oh,
Christ.

1103
00:47:08,581 --> 00:47:09,301
Yes.
I mean,

1104
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:11,210
that's one of the terrible things about 
having a,

1105
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,610
a very bad illness is that not only does
it do you in,

1106
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:17,610
but you can see it taking its toll on 
the people around you.

1107
00:47:17,611 --> 00:47:19,410
I think that might even be worse.
I mean,

1108
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,500
this is gradations of hell,
but still,

1109
00:47:22,501 --> 00:47:25,440
that's,
so you also can't allow that to happen.

1110
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:28,020
If you have a loved person around you 
and they're ill,

1111
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:32,650
you have a moral not to let it tear you 
down because then it's on them.

1112
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,040
That's no good.
Yeah.

1113
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:34,601
And you think,
well,

1114
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,434
how can you remain healthy and strong in
the face of the terrible suffering of 

1115
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:39,190
someone who's close to you?

1116
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,040
It's like,
well that,

1117
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:43,720
well that's it.
The alternative is worse.

1118
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:44,583
You want me to get sick and get a 
weighed and not be able to take care of 

1119
00:47:46,691 --> 00:47:47,440
you or me?
Right.

1120
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,660
And then we didn't,
we both drown faster.

1121
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,340
Right.
Not Helpful.

1122
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,650
What about,
did she ever go through a place over,

1123
00:47:53,651 --> 00:47:54,484
I guess,
I guess some people do this where you 

1124
00:47:56,441 --> 00:47:58,420
know,
kids who have some type of autoimmune or

1125
00:47:58,421 --> 00:48:00,310
some type of disease or whatever it may 
be,

1126
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,380
they didn't necessarily,
you know,

1127
00:48:02,381 --> 00:48:04,300
they were born with it or aren't 
happening somehow.

1128
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:07,030
It's not like they ate something 
themselves.

1129
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,290
They weren't necessarily the responsible
to say,

1130
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,153
right.
I mean,

1131
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,030
was she responsible for causing all 
these,

1132
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,193
you know,
all the pain in her body or was it just 

1133
00:48:15,911 --> 00:48:16,744
something that happens?
That's what we told her is just what 

1134
00:48:18,671 --> 00:48:19,900
this life kid,
it's a lot.

1135
00:48:19,901 --> 00:48:20,734
It's not you.

1136
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:22,780
We also told her very,
very many,

1137
00:48:22,781 --> 00:48:25,420
many times and we were very careful 
about this.

1138
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:29,740
Do not use your illness as an excuse.
As soon as you do that,

1139
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:32,950
you can't tell the difference between 
the illness and your character.

1140
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,890
It's right.
So don't let it turn you into a victim.

1141
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,920
Even though it's obviously it's a 
catastrophe.

1142
00:48:38,921 --> 00:48:41,770
Like we were very clear about that and 
that wasn't her fault,

1143
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:42,933
you know?
But that she still had to bear up under 

1144
00:48:45,281 --> 00:48:46,114
it as well as possible and to do 
everything she could and not use it as 

1145
00:48:49,691 --> 00:48:50,524
an excuse.
And we talked to her about that a lot 

1146
00:48:52,031 --> 00:48:53,890
and we're clear about it because,
and I've seen,

1147
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:54,724
this is one of the things I really 
dislike about what the universities are 

1148
00:48:56,981 --> 00:49:00,040
doing with disability.
It's like everybody gets a disability.

1149
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:03,280
It's like well no wonder because people 
have hard lives.

1150
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,113
You know it's like it's very rare to 
find someone who isn't suffering under 

1151
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:12,090
an undue load of some sort.
There's something wrong with them

1152
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,553
or there's something wrong in their 
family that serious or they have 

1153
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:19,600
terrible economic pressure.
Like there's something wrong.

1154
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:21,760
It's like okay we should make allowances
for you.

1155
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:22,713
It's like Oh yeah what allowances.
What exactly does that entitle me to 

1156
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,410
while I tell you,
man that's a murky place you do not want

1157
00:49:29,411 --> 00:49:31,600
to go because then you don't know 
anymore.

1158
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:35,470
It's like well what's my responsibility?
I mean I have this undue burden to bear.

1159
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,690
Well how does that mitigate my 
responsibility?

1160
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,810
Well the answer is as little as 
possible.

1161
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:43,860
You don't go there cause you get 
confused and,

1162
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,793
and as soon as you get confused,
well then the illness is not only got 

1163
00:49:46,991 --> 00:49:47,824
you physiologically,
it's got your psychologically and then 

1164
00:49:49,511 --> 00:49:50,440
you're in deep trouble.

1165
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:51,633
And so we were also very,
very key and to her great credit as far 

1166
00:49:54,731 --> 00:49:55,564
as I can tell,
like I wouldn't say she never used her 

1167
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:02,860
illness as an excuse because never is a 
lot,

1168
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:04,930
you know,
or never is an extreme.

1169
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:06,183
But she certainly was stood the 
temptation to do it habitually and to 

1170
00:50:11,651 --> 00:50:12,484
warp per character as a consequence.
And she did figure out what was wrong 

1171
00:50:14,981 --> 00:50:15,814
with her and fixed it.
And so now she doesn't have any of 

1172
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:18,724
these.
She's healthy now while she still has 

1173
00:50:20,441 --> 00:50:22,810
some residual damage from,
from everything that happened.

1174
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:23,644
Like I just found out yesterday,
she went to Chicago to have her ankle 

1175
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,860
checked out because it isn't working 
very well.

1176
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:28,694
And they told her that she had to have 
the old replacement taken out and a new 

1177
00:50:31,341 --> 00:50:32,870
one put in.
So,

1178
00:50:32,871 --> 00:50:35,510
but,
but in her realm of catastrophe,

1179
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,600
that actually constitutes not news.

1180
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,950
That's not as bad as it could be.
So,

1181
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:43,940
strangely enough.
So it's not like she's out of the woods.

1182
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:46,770
But you taught her from an early age 
that I'm sorry to cut you off.

1183
00:50:46,771 --> 00:50:46,960
No,
no,

1184
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,010
no.
That even though she had a,

1185
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:49,873
you know,
let's just for this state of the 

1186
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,320
conversation,
a physical disability,

1187
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:55,363
right.
She wasn't as able bodied physically as 

1188
00:50:57,651 --> 00:50:59,870
the majority of people.
Is that clear to say,

1189
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:01,303
um,
that you told her like never allow that 

1190
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:04,880
to give you special privilege?
Well,

1191
00:51:04,881 --> 00:51:06,470
never allow that to be never,
no,

1192
00:51:06,471 --> 00:51:07,304
it wasn't that exactly.
It was never used that as an excuse to 

1193
00:51:10,011 --> 00:51:13,300
not do something you could do even 
without the thing.

1194
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,570
Yes.
Because it's the,

1195
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,670
there's a deception element there.
It's like,

1196
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:17,743
well,
I don't want to do that and I have this 

1197
00:51:19,761 --> 00:51:22,260
illness.
That's right.

1198
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:23,103
Got It.
Don't use your illness as a means of 

1199
00:51:24,531 --> 00:51:26,990
getting away with something because you 
blur the line.

1200
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,750
Constantly use that rest of your life.
Right.

1201
00:51:29,751 --> 00:51:30,584
And if you do that a hundred times,
you'll be so confused about what's 

1202
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:36,590
illness and what's,
and what's not that you'll not know.

1203
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,840
You won't know anymore.
And maybe you won't be able to figure it

1204
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:41,210
out again and then you're in a very bad 
place.

1205
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:42,403
You know,
there was some things that she had to 

1206
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:47,540
have done that were allowances,
like when she was doing exams,

1207
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,690
she had to type because she couldn't 
write her writing,

1208
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,430
you know,
and she couldn't sit on the floor,

1209
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,680
cross legged.
So she had to sit in a chair,

1210
00:51:54,681 --> 00:51:56,600
like things that she actually couldn't 
do,

1211
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,550
but she still didn't work.
Yes.

1212
00:51:58,551 --> 00:51:59,860
She did everything.
She said,

1213
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,010
oh,
I can't take the task.

1214
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:03,140
Yeah.
I can't do the exam at all.

1215
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,480
Yeah.
But she was able to do it with different

1216
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:06,440
circumstance.
Right,

1217
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,220
right,
right.

1218
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,051
And so,
and,

1219
00:52:08,051 --> 00:52:10,400
and the consequence of that was that 
once she,

1220
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:13,160
she figured out that most of what was 
causing her,

1221
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,420
what,
what was bothering her,

1222
00:52:14,421 --> 00:52:16,730
all of it by the looks of it was a 
consequence of it,

1223
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:20,390
a set of extreme sensitivities to almost
every sort of food.

1224
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:24,110
So she hardly eats anything now.
So the only thing she eats his beef,

1225
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:25,300
that's it.
Beef,

1226
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:26,480
salt,
water.

1227
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,070
That's it.
Nothing else.

1228
00:52:28,071 --> 00:52:28,800
That's it.
Yeah,

1229
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,820
that's it.
And she's been eating that way for,

1230
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,990
well,
mostly for about three years,

1231
00:52:32,991 --> 00:52:35,540
but almost completely for a year.
And she feels fine.

1232
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:38,510
She's 100% she has no symptoms and no 
vegetables,

1233
00:52:38,511 --> 00:52:39,830
no supplements.
That's it.

1234
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,940
Beef,
salt.

1235
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:43,070
I'm serious.
Cause you never cheats.

1236
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:43,923
Wow.
Never because she doesn't want to feel 

1237
00:52:44,781 --> 00:52:45,740
pain and suffering.
Yes.

1238
00:52:45,741 --> 00:52:48,020
Well it takes it if she,
if she eats the wrong thing,

1239
00:52:48,021 --> 00:52:48,854
she has a terrible catastrophic 
emotional and physical reactions for a 

1240
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:53,450
month.

1241
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:54,283
Wow.
She essentially eliminate all food and 

1242
00:52:55,521 --> 00:52:58,040
try one thing at a time.
And so that's going to work.

1243
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:58,874
Let's do this.
And it took about three years to figure 

1244
00:52:59,961 --> 00:53:01,610
it out.
So yes,

1245
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:02,810
while I was right,
I can't,

1246
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:06,500
it's absolutely beyond comprehension.
It's a diet that I follow almost,

1247
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,360
almost entirely now.
Beef,

1248
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:09,580
salted water.
Yes.

1249
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:10,603
I'd been eating that way for about three
months and I'd been on an extremely low 

1250
00:53:12,921 --> 00:53:15,710
carb diet for about two,
two and a half years.

1251
00:53:15,711 --> 00:53:16,970
Something like that.
Wow.

1252
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,833
So,
cause I,

1253
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,673
my,
both my wife and I have autoimmune 

1254
00:53:19,581 --> 00:53:22,710
symptoms and she got all of them.
Your daughter.

1255
00:53:22,711 --> 00:53:25,950
Yeah.
So she got [inaudible] by a thousand.

1256
00:53:25,951 --> 00:53:26,790
Yeah.
That's right.

1257
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:29,430
So and so,
but when she sorted out what was wrong,

1258
00:53:29,431 --> 00:53:30,264
she convinced me to also try what she 
was doing and it's been extraordinarily 

1259
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:34,150
help.
Really need to.

1260
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,780
Yeah.
So you know who would,

1261
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:37,680
who would have guessed it?

1262
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,370
So anyway,
so what you do when,

1263
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:43,290
when things are too much for you as you,
you narrow your timeframe.

1264
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:47,310
I also an enrolled in chapter 12 you 
know what?

1265
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:48,323
There's a,
there's a fair bit of discussion in 

1266
00:53:49,411 --> 00:53:50,244
there about fragility and vulnerability,
which is really what you confront when 

1267
00:53:53,011 --> 00:53:54,330
you have a sick kid.
It's like,

1268
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:57,270
oh my God,
how can the world be constituted so that

1269
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,060
a child can unfairly suffer in this 
manner?

1270
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:01,163
It's like,
okay,

1271
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,180
here's a way of thinking about it.
All right?

1272
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:05,760
Take away everything from your child 
that makes them vulnerable.

1273
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,400
Let's say I have a three year old.
It's like,

1274
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:09,061
well,
three year olds,

1275
00:54:09,061 --> 00:54:10,640
they're kind of cute.
They run around there,

1276
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:13,560
they're little in there and they're 
vulnerable obviously.

1277
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:15,810
But that makes them cute and attractive 
and,

1278
00:54:15,811 --> 00:54:16,710
and,
and,

1279
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:17,663
and lovable.
All of the vulnerability that's built 

1280
00:54:19,351 --> 00:54:20,250
into that.
So you think,

1281
00:54:20,251 --> 00:54:21,084
well you move,
remove that one by one while they're 

1282
00:54:22,201 --> 00:54:23,034
eight foot tall now and they're made out
of steel and there are parts of 

1283
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:26,124
replaceable,
they have artificially intelligent 

1284
00:54:27,301 --> 00:54:28,890
brain,
like you replace them.

1285
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:29,963
Obviously this is hypothetical with a,
with a superhuman robot that doesn't 

1286
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:35,270
die.
It's like fine,

1287
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,280
but where's the three year old?
Right.

1288
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:41,130
So one of the things I thought about 
when I was writing this was,

1289
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,870
you know,
when you love someone,

1290
00:54:42,871 --> 00:54:44,550
especially what,
when you love someone,

1291
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:49,740
you love them not only despite their 
fragility but also because of it.

1292
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,440
And so then that's the price he paid for
it.

1293
00:54:52,441 --> 00:54:54,030
It's like,
well you wouldn't,

1294
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,710
they wouldn't be who they were if they 
weren't,

1295
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:57,623
they wouldn't be who they were if they 
weren't fragile and limited in their 

1296
00:55:01,111 --> 00:55:01,944
particular way.
And the fact he liked to have them 

1297
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:04,501
around.
You Think,

1298
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:05,640
oh well that,
I mean that gets,

1299
00:55:05,641 --> 00:55:08,790
you think that that fragility and 
vulnerability is justifiable.

1300
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,640
It's like,
well then you can't allow that.

1301
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,683
It's re it's its existence to make you 
bitter because he can't have it both 

1302
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:15,990
ways.

1303
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:18,910
You can't have them being vulnerable and
cute and,

1304
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,520
and interesting and,
and small and,

1305
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,950
and,
and needing care.

1306
00:55:22,951 --> 00:55:24,360
But striving to,
to,

1307
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:28,920
to develop and grow.
You can't have that without the mall.

1308
00:55:28,921 --> 00:55:33,150
So being prone to pain and destruction 
and vulnerability and so yeah,

1309
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,170
take your choice then what do you do it?
Teach them to be strong.

1310
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,720
That's what you do.
You don't get rid of the vulnerability.

1311
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,890
You teach them to be strong.
Yeah.

1312
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,750
So,
and that's that.

1313
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:46,260
That's also a theme that runs through 
the book and in many,

1314
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:48,690
many ways is that you don't protect your
children.

1315
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,213
In fact,
you do,

1316
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,053
you do the opposite.
You expose them to the world as much as 

1317
00:55:52,681 --> 00:55:54,930
you possibly can and you make them 
strong.

1318
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,270
That's the best antidote to their 
vulnerability,

1319
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:00,240
not to protect them.
There's no protecting people.

1320
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:03,150
We already established that life's a 
fatal game.

1321
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:04,463
There's no protecting people,
but you can definitely make them strong 

1322
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:10,110
and maybe you can make them strong 
enough to transcend that.

1323
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:11,520
That's the goal,
man.

1324
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,073
So is there anything that you wish you 
would've done differently with your 

1325
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:20,571
daughter or your son that you didn't do?
Not not have any grip.

1326
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:28,690
Not of any great significance.
I mean I have,

1327
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,393
I have wishes.
I suppose from time to time that things 

1328
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,070
could have been different.
I,

1329
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:34,403
I spent less time on the positive 
aspects of my son and my daughter 

1330
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:44,500
because we were contending with 
catastrophe so frequently.

1331
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:45,431
And so,
you know,

1332
00:56:45,431 --> 00:56:46,264
my,
both my kids have a variety of 

1333
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:50,130
interesting talents and it would have 
been

1334
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,150
better perhaps to have had the time to 
develop those more thoroughly.

1335
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,680
But you know,
when my son,

1336
00:56:58,970 --> 00:56:59,803
well he,
I wouldn't say he didn't get as much 

1337
00:57:02,151 --> 00:57:02,984
attention as he needed.
He didn't get as much attention as I 

1338
00:57:05,211 --> 00:57:10,211
would have liked to have paid him.
But by the same token,

1339
00:57:10,371 --> 00:57:11,204
and it isn't obvious that it's been bad 
for it because it required him from a 

1340
00:57:14,121 --> 00:57:18,470
very early age to grow the hell up.
And we relied on him right from the time

1341
00:57:18,471 --> 00:57:20,510
he was a young kid to make intelligent 
decisions.

1342
00:57:20,511 --> 00:57:22,310
We assumed he would make intelligent 
decisions.

1343
00:57:22,311 --> 00:57:25,550
He was consulted with regards to 
decisions and so,

1344
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:28,610
and it also made them into someone who 
is,

1345
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:32,300
who is very self sufficient and capable 
of taking care of himself.

1346
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,193
So it might've been nicer for me,
I suppose to have spent more time with 

1347
00:57:37,461 --> 00:57:38,294
him.
Right.

1348
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,230
Um,
but,

1349
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:43,160
but he lives down the street from me now
and I spend time with them and we have a

1350
00:57:43,161 --> 00:57:45,020
great relationship.
And so it's just,

1351
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:45,920
it's,
you know,

1352
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:49,810
and as he has a very good relationship 
with his sister and uh,

1353
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:53,270
so it turned out as well as it could 
have.

1354
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,770
Right.
So,

1355
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:57,710
but that didn't mean that those years in
there,

1356
00:57:57,890 --> 00:57:59,960
they were brutal.
There was some brutal times.

1357
00:57:59,961 --> 00:58:00,794
Man is one night in particular.
Like she was in absolutely a absolute 

1358
00:58:03,411 --> 00:58:06,140
agony and I couldn't get it under 
control.

1359
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:07,370
And I could see,
well,

1360
00:58:07,371 --> 00:58:09,380
because I am a clinician,
I could see,

1361
00:58:09,381 --> 00:58:10,340
I thought,
God dammit,

1362
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:11,383
I'm going to end it,
end up taking her to Cam h as the 

1363
00:58:13,641 --> 00:58:16,010
psychiatric hospital because it looks 
like it's going to break out.

1364
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:16,730
Really.
Like,

1365
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:20,000
goddammit,
I couldn't see a way to resolve it,

1366
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,640
but it pushed her right to the brink,
but,

1367
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:24,980
but not over.
So,

1368
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,490
and there was another episode after,
after she had her hip removed,

1369
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,900
hip,
hip replaced.

1370
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:31,063
She was put in a rehab home hospital for
awhile and she was the youngest person 

1371
00:58:34,371 --> 00:58:35,780
in it by like 60 years.

1372
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:39,200
And they treated her terribly,
it was a terrible place,

1373
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:43,940
mean,
mean blind nurses and very,

1374
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:47,270
very badly run.
And they traumatized her hospital.

1375
00:58:47,271 --> 00:58:49,280
It was a worse experience than the damn 
surgery.

1376
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:50,930
And so that,
that was,

1377
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,730
that took her quite a while to recover 
from,

1378
00:58:52,731 --> 00:58:55,760
but she did recover from it.
Do you ever think now,

1379
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:57,590
um,
you know,

1380
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:58,543
since you're a clinical kind of clinical
psychologist and you've done all this 

1381
00:59:01,431 --> 00:59:02,264
research and work and studies,
do you believe that your daughter was 

1382
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:10,751
meant to experience this for you to kind
of test your ability to be with her?

1383
00:59:12,411 --> 00:59:15,620
And do you think she would have been 
able to grow and the way she is now with

1384
00:59:15,621 --> 00:59:18,050
someone who didn't have the practice 
that you had?

1385
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:19,243
Well,
I think it was fortunate for all of us 

1386
00:59:20,601 --> 00:59:21,231
that,
well,

1387
00:59:21,231 --> 00:59:24,540
my wife too,
my wife had worked in palliative care as

1388
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,640
a volunteer and she was a massage 
therapist for a long time.

1389
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,470
She's very good at,
and my wife has a real,

1390
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:35,060
she's a really tough person and if you 
don't need help and you want it,

1391
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:38,240
she'll cut you into ribbons.
But if you need help,

1392
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:39,883
she will really help you.
So she's really good at differentiating 

1393
00:59:42,591 --> 00:59:43,424
between people who actually need help,
in which case she is right there and 

1394
00:59:46,281 --> 00:59:47,114
people who could stand up on their own.
And if you can't stand up on your own 

1395
00:59:50,061 --> 00:59:52,940
and you could,
if you could stand up on your own end,

1396
00:59:52,941 --> 00:59:53,774
you aren't.
You don't want to be around her because 

1397
00:59:55,371 --> 00:59:57,350
she will.
She will put you in your place.

1398
00:59:57,710 --> 00:59:59,470
And it was so funny because our kids 
are,

1399
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,473
our kids used to bring their friends 
over all the time when they were 

1400
01:00:02,211 --> 01:00:03,870
teenagers,
which we actually quite light.

1401
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,500
And what we had a rule for the 
teenagers,

1402
01:00:06,501 --> 01:00:08,750
which was,
we're really happy you're here,

1403
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,170
but if you do something stupid and you 
never get to come back,

1404
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:13,760
that's actually okay with us.

1405
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,760
Right.
And so they knew that and it was no joke

1406
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:19,190
because we were happy they were there 
and they were welcome.

1407
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:23,060
But we were perfectly happy to dispense 
with them if they misbehaved forever.

1408
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:23,923
And so,
but what was really funny was that the 

1409
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,204
kids would come over,
the teenagers would come over and they 

1410
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:28,424
were pretty afraid of me to begin with.
But after being around for a couple of 

1411
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,230
weeks,
they were way more afraid of my wife.

1412
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:35,390
So yes.
So that was very funny.

1413
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,291
Yeah.
Because she's,

1414
01:00:36,291 --> 01:00:38,150
you know,
she's quite a pleasant person and she's,

1415
01:00:38,151 --> 01:00:38,984
she's not,
uh,

1416
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,800
she's only five foot two.
So she's about,

1417
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:42,740
although she's,
you know,

1418
01:00:42,741 --> 01:00:45,380
she's imposing enough cause she's also 
in good physical shape,

1419
01:00:45,381 --> 01:00:49,520
but it was because I'm actually kind of 
soft hearted and she's not softhearted,

1420
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:52,490
although she can really take care of 
people who need to be taken care of.

1421
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,140
So,
no.

1422
01:00:54,141 --> 01:00:55,670
So I think,
you know,

1423
01:00:55,671 --> 01:00:56,504
mckayla had a fortunate,
fortunate circumstance in that sense 

1424
01:00:59,211 --> 01:01:03,260
because both of us had a lot of 
experience dealing with catastrophe.

1425
01:01:03,261 --> 01:01:06,920
And so when it came along we weren't,
we were overwhelmed by it,

1426
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,140
but it wasn't because we didn't know 
what we were doing,

1427
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:10,880
we knew what we were doing.
It was just,

1428
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:15,940
even though we didn't know what we were 
doing as much as might be possible,

1429
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:19,820
that doesn't mean that we could deal 
with it because it was,

1430
01:01:19,821 --> 01:01:21,350
well it took us,
it took us one,

1431
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:22,363
it must have been seven or eight months 
to arrange the ankle surgery and there 

1432
01:01:25,971 --> 01:01:29,660
was a waiting list in Canada at that 
point of I think three years actually.

1433
01:01:29,661 --> 01:01:30,494
They wanted to fuse her foot,
which is really bad thing for someone 

1434
01:01:32,961 --> 01:01:35,300
young.
And so we looked in India,

1435
01:01:35,301 --> 01:01:36,134
we looked in all Christ,
we looked all over the world for ankle 

1436
01:01:38,121 --> 01:01:39,680
surgery,
like really everywhere.

1437
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:43,190
And finally the government in Canada,
it was actually quite helpful.

1438
01:01:43,191 --> 01:01:47,480
We found a private clinic in Vancouver 
that did the surgery and the,

1439
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:48,220
and,
and,

1440
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:49,053
uh,
the Ministry of Health in Ontario was 

1441
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:53,480
quite helpful to us at that point.
But we were scrambling to,

1442
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:54,530
well,
what,

1443
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:57,560
what should we do?
Should we have her ankle replacement?

1444
01:01:57,561 --> 01:01:59,370
What sort of replacement?
Who did we talk to?

1445
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:00,620
Well,
what about this waiting list?

1446
01:02:00,621 --> 01:02:01,730
Three years.
Like,

1447
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:02,630
no way.
Shit,

1448
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,580
man,
she can't live for three a week.

1449
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:07,790
Oh yeah,
that's three.

1450
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:09,140
Here's,
that was just beyond,

1451
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,033
did you ever doubt yourself in terms of 
your ability and your research and your 

1452
01:02:13,821 --> 01:02:16,220
studies?
Did you ever say to yourself like,

1453
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:17,420
man,
if I can,

1454
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:18,920
you know,
figure this out,

1455
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:21,450
then all of my work is for nothing?
Well,

1456
01:02:21,451 --> 01:02:23,100
no,
I never thought it was for nothing,

1457
01:02:23,101 --> 01:02:23,934
but I certainly,
I certainly doubted whether or not we 

1458
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:29,850
were going to be able to figure out,
figure this out.

1459
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:32,290
Well,
because you thought it,

1460
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,260
you know,
and at that time you're extremely,

1461
01:02:34,261 --> 01:02:37,050
uh,
educated research,

1462
01:02:37,051 --> 01:02:38,400
you know,
you'd see a lot.

1463
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,680
Did you,
did that give you a fear of like,

1464
01:02:40,681 --> 01:02:42,000
well,
if I can't figure this out,

1465
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,440
then no.
One of course,

1466
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,410
of course.
Well her,

1467
01:02:44,411 --> 01:02:48,270
her prognosis was multiple early joint 
replacements and that was like,

1468
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:50,730
that was the good news because the bad 
news is,

1469
01:02:50,731 --> 01:02:55,731
well how many and how many can you stand
and when does that kill you?

1470
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:56,731
Like,
you know,

1471
01:02:56,731 --> 01:03:01,560
so her real prognosis was plenty of pain
with an early death,

1472
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,990
you know,
because well even now,

1473
01:03:03,991 --> 01:03:04,890
even now,
you know,

1474
01:03:04,891 --> 01:03:07,590
like the surgeon who talked to her 
yesterday said,

1475
01:03:07,591 --> 01:03:11,220
well because he talked to her about the 
risk of amputation in the future.

1476
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:13,260
It's like,
well this is the second joint revision.

1477
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,120
It's like maybe this would last 15 
years.

1478
01:03:15,121 --> 01:03:16,470
We don't know what the hell is going to 
happen.

1479
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,313
You well,
so our response to that is that's 15 

1480
01:03:19,951 --> 01:03:21,090
years from now.
It's like,

1481
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:22,530
who knows?
Well,

1482
01:03:22,531 --> 01:03:27,531
things are better now for how people 
understand how to replace an ankle.

1483
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:30,480
Then they were,
I think it was 10 years ago that she had

1484
01:03:30,481 --> 01:03:33,570
this one replaced and it helped.
It wasn't perfect.

1485
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:37,250
Her hip is perfect.
The ankle has always been troubled,

1486
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:39,360
but way less trouble than it was.
And so,

1487
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:42,930
well you,
you struggle forward the best you can.

1488
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:46,500
And so I suppose she could adapt to an 
amputation if that was necessary.

1489
01:03:46,501 --> 01:03:47,334
But at the moment it isn't necessary,
but multiple amputations is not 

1490
01:03:50,221 --> 01:03:53,160
something to really be looking forward 
to when you're 16 you know,

1491
01:03:53,161 --> 01:03:55,620
and they were going to put her on 
corticosteroids to control her,

1492
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:57,440
her,
her inflammation,

1493
01:03:57,441 --> 01:03:59,730
and that would have produced cushing's 
disease.

1494
01:03:59,731 --> 01:04:02,160
And so that makes your face all puffy 
and it makes you gain weight.

1495
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:02,993
And so it's very physically disfiguring.
So we decided not to go down that route 

1496
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,940
and wow.
Yeah.

1497
01:04:08,941 --> 01:04:10,230
Well,
but you know,

1498
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:11,730
it's,
it's worked out.

1499
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:12,653
Thank God it's quite the miracle.
And she had a baby a year ago and we 

1500
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,230
were never sure that was going to 
happen.

1501
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:17,550
So grads,
thank you.

1502
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,920
Yes,
yes,

1503
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:19,763
that's for sure.
So now we have this respite where she's 

1504
01:04:22,021 --> 01:04:26,460
healthy and the last time I saw her,
she was looking great.

1505
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,070
Like she just glowing.
She's so healthy.

1506
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:32,130
I can't believe it.
It's just beyond belief.

1507
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:35,610
And congrats on all the hard work you've
done to make a,

1508
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,140
make it a possibility.
Yeah.

1509
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:42,210
Well we avoided the worst excesses of 
hell during the catastrophe.

1510
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:45,540
So that's something.
And it did allow her the space to figure

1511
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:47,880
out.
And my wife had always thought that diet

1512
01:04:47,881 --> 01:04:50,790
had a relationship to it.
And we investigated that.

1513
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:54,120
Like there's a good literature that 
shows if you have arthritic symptoms and

1514
01:04:54,121 --> 01:04:57,450
you stop eating if you fast,
they go away.

1515
01:04:58,330 --> 01:04:59,640
So That's interesting.
It's like,

1516
01:04:59,641 --> 01:05:01,500
well food must be causing it and see it.
Yeah.

1517
01:05:01,501 --> 01:05:04,380
But once you start to eat again to 
survive what you eat,

1518
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:06,840
it comes back.
It turns out no,

1519
01:05:06,841 --> 01:05:10,320
not no matter what,
almost no matter what.

1520
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,870
Cause she sensitive to virtually 
everything,

1521
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:13,883
but she isn't sensitive to meet.
And so it turns out that if you eat 

1522
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:18,370
meat,
you can live.

1523
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:20,530
Right.
So that's a big difference between being

1524
01:05:20,531 --> 01:05:24,190
sensitive to everything and not being 
sensitive to one thing.

1525
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,890
And so,
so it's,

1526
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:29,530
it's a harsh diet.
Um,

1527
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:31,203
it's made traveling difficult,
although I can eat in restaurants 

1528
01:05:33,431 --> 01:05:36,250
because most restaurants can cook a 
steak with nothing on it.

1529
01:05:36,251 --> 01:05:38,890
And that's made things much easier while
I'm traveling,

1530
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:40,173
but

1531
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:42,020
whatever,
whatever,

1532
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,180
it's working.
And so thank God for that.

1533
01:05:44,181 --> 01:05:45,240
Amazing.
Hmm.

1534
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:46,183
Do you believe?
Do you think hypothetically if your 

1535
01:05:49,371 --> 01:05:53,330
daughter was healthy and never had any 
of these complications that you would be

1536
01:05:53,331 --> 01:05:57,050
the man you are impacting people,
that the success,

1537
01:05:57,051 --> 01:05:57,681
the,
you know,

1538
01:05:57,681 --> 01:06:00,350
all the attention you'd be getting.
Do you think you'd have as much

1539
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:04,430
written 12th chapter,
that's for sure.

1540
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:08,720
Do you think in general you would still 
be able to have the ideals,

1541
01:06:08,721 --> 01:06:12,080
the belief,
the 42 that you have to reach people and

1542
01:06:12,081 --> 01:06:13,230
really impact people?
Yeah,

1543
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,180
I think,
I think so,

1544
01:06:14,181 --> 01:06:15,290
but I,
I know what you're,

1545
01:06:15,291 --> 01:06:16,830
I know what you're saying.
You know your,

1546
01:06:16,831 --> 01:06:19,730
your question as well.
To what degree is adversity,

1547
01:06:19,731 --> 01:06:22,130
character building,
and the answer to that is plenty.

1548
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,440
But I was already,
like I said,

1549
01:06:24,441 --> 01:06:26,900
it was the same with my wife.
We weren't naive people.

1550
01:06:26,901 --> 01:06:27,734
You know,
because I had an extensive clinical 

1551
01:06:29,511 --> 01:06:33,350
practice I was dealing with,
with heavy level adversity.

1552
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:36,610
Oh 25 hours a week.
Your daughter knows.

1553
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:37,730
No,
but there were,

1554
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:38,613
you know,
there were other problems in my family 

1555
01:06:39,651 --> 01:06:42,980
and so forth that I dealt with as well.
And so we were already,

1556
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:44,870
we'd already,
I think,

1557
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:50,800
garnered most of what we could from 
confronting adverse situations,

1558
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,510
you know.
Um,

1559
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:56,420
now did,
did that add a different level to it?

1560
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:00,850
It's fine.

1561
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:05,243
It probably,
it probably fire tested our 

1562
01:07:07,921 --> 01:07:09,390
relationship,
our familiar,

1563
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:11,400
it probably brought our family closer 
together,

1564
01:07:11,401 --> 01:07:12,234
all things considered.
I saw the same thing happened when my 

1565
01:07:14,161 --> 01:07:15,870
wife's mother die,
died.

1566
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,040
She died of a pre frontal dementia and 
she,

1567
01:07:19,041 --> 01:07:19,874
she developed it quite young about it,
started to really manifest itself in 

1568
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:26,250
early fifties and she died when she was 
70 and she fell apart over,

1569
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:27,540
you know,
18 years.

1570
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:30,540
And she was very physically healthy.
Um,

1571
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:33,390
and her husband,
who was quite the man about town when he

1572
01:07:33,391 --> 01:07:34,980
was a young guy,
real extrovert,

1573
01:07:34,981 --> 01:07:39,150
he was a real character in our hometown.
He took care of her so well.

1574
01:07:39,151 --> 01:07:42,420
It was absolutely jaw dropping.
Every time she slipped,

1575
01:07:42,421 --> 01:07:43,254
he'd step up to the plate and he,
he took care of her until he couldn't 

1576
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:49,350
lift her out of her chair anymore.
And he was getting old too.

1577
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:51,960
And so she wasn't in an old age home for
very long.

1578
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:54,510
And then we were around when she died.
Um,

1579
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,250
you know,
over the last couple of days,

1580
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,520
just before her death and her family,
her,

1581
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:02,760
her sister is a palliative care nurse or
other sister's a pharmacist.

1582
01:08:02,761 --> 01:08:05,400
And tammy's had the experiences that 
I've already described.

1583
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,550
And then her father really stepped up to
the plate.

1584
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:10,410
And so the whole family gathered around 
for that.

1585
01:08:10,411 --> 01:08:13,590
And um,
they acted impeccably throughout it.

1586
01:08:13,591 --> 01:08:17,810
I would say they took care of their 
mother carefully while she was dying and

1587
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:20,450
they pulled together.
And one of the consequences of that,

1588
01:08:20,451 --> 01:08:21,284
which was so interesting,
is that although their mother died and 

1589
01:08:23,481 --> 01:08:27,230
that was a terrible loss there borns 
that connected them,

1590
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:28,243
all of them strengthened to the point 
where I would say that was almost 

1591
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,160
compensation for the loss of their 
mother.

1592
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:39,170
So that was really interesting to see 
what happens even in a dire circumstance

1593
01:08:39,171 --> 01:08:42,710
if people do do what they can't.

1594
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:44,360
No,
I'm not saying that that's going to work

1595
01:08:44,361 --> 01:08:45,194
for every situation because I know 
people get cut off at the knees and 

1596
01:08:47,061 --> 01:08:49,550
sometimes you hate a tragedy that while 
it's fatal,

1597
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:51,860
you know,
that you cannot rectify.

1598
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:52,843
It's a real catastrophe.
But it was very interesting watching 

1599
01:08:54,981 --> 01:08:55,814
that because they were alert and awake 
around the deathbed and they weren't 

1600
01:08:59,121 --> 01:08:59,954
fighting with each other at all.
There was no familial squabbling cause 

1601
01:09:03,401 --> 01:09:04,234
you can imagine that that would happen 
cause everyone's stressed and then you 

1602
01:09:07,851 --> 01:09:11,450
can just imagine how terrible that would
make something that's already awful.

1603
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:14,210
There was none of that.
They focus their attention on her,

1604
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:15,213
you know,
they gave her water when she needed it 

1605
01:09:16,221 --> 01:09:19,520
and they watched her and they made,
they made this terrible thing,

1606
01:09:19,521 --> 01:09:23,540
the least amount of awful it could be 
and it definitely pulled them together.

1607
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:24,923
That whole family including me is closer
because of what they went through and 

1608
01:09:31,101 --> 01:09:33,770
also how they went through it and it's 
probably the case.

1609
01:09:35,150 --> 01:09:35,983
Well I would say definitely advanced the
maturity of my son because he was cold 

1610
01:09:41,961 --> 01:09:42,681
and I,
I told him,

1611
01:09:42,681 --> 01:09:47,030
look kid,
like you can't add anything to this.

1612
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:48,201
We're,
we're,

1613
01:09:48,201 --> 01:09:49,034
we're up to here.
You have to conduct yourself properly 

1614
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:54,470
because otherwise everything's going to 
shake and fall.

1615
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:55,513
We can't have more of this.
You can't bring any and anything 

1616
01:09:58,491 --> 01:10:00,830
unnecessary into this.
And it was an all star.

1617
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:02,810
It was,
it was a remarkable man.

1618
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:03,813
And,
and he who is only on grade 10 when 

1619
01:10:05,541 --> 01:10:06,374
most,
most of this happened and your friends 

1620
01:10:07,251 --> 01:10:11,030
are pretty damn important when you're in
grade 10 and he stuck around a lot to be

1621
01:10:11,031 --> 01:10:12,440
helpful.
So yeah,

1622
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:14,720
it was really good for him,
man.

1623
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:15,591
Yeah,
well he,

1624
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:16,820
yeah,
he's a good character.

1625
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,900
He's amazing.
He's,

1626
01:10:17,901 --> 01:10:20,840
he's quite,
quite something and it was very helpful.

1627
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:23,870
He was very helpful to his sister.
They had their fights obviously.

1628
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:26,480
Well and she was often unreasonable and 
no bloody wonder,

1629
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:27,823
you know,
well when you're strung out and you 

1630
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:32,000
can't feel anything but pain.
God,

1631
01:10:32,001 --> 01:10:32,834
she went through so much like even 
watching her withdraw from the opiates 

1632
01:10:35,211 --> 01:10:37,010
cause she was on them for about a year 
and a half.

1633
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,070
She just quit.
Hey,

1634
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:39,140
they will,
as soon as she was done,

1635
01:10:39,141 --> 01:10:41,060
her surgeons like,
I'm not taking these anymore.

1636
01:10:41,061 --> 01:10:41,894
And she had formal medication,
which is the sensation of ants crawling 

1637
01:10:44,811 --> 01:10:47,780
under your skin.
She had that for like a month and uh,

1638
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:49,850
God,
unbelievable.

1639
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:51,320
He was,
she just,

1640
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,590
just sailed through it.
It's like I'm done with these.

1641
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:55,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

1642
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:57,810
You guys have been through a lot.
Yeah.

1643
01:10:57,811 --> 01:10:58,644
That's your lot here.
What's your biggest fear now moving 

1644
01:11:01,221 --> 01:11:03,020
forward in your,
in your own life?

1645
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,240
Oh,
making a mistake at the moment.

1646
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,193
Cause like I'd be,
I'd been the subject of so much public 

1647
01:11:08,541 --> 01:11:11,960
attention in the last two years and like
I've been in a situation where,

1648
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:13,333
well,
even things I didn't say have also 

1649
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:18,120
almost been fatal because people take 
them out of context.

1650
01:11:18,290 --> 01:11:18,891
Right.
You know,

1651
01:11:18,891 --> 01:11:19,780
and,
uh,

1652
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:20,993
but I'm,
my biggest fear has been that I do 

1653
01:11:24,241 --> 01:11:25,074
something careless and,
and that there are like serious 

1654
01:11:30,961 --> 01:11:35,760
cascading consequences to feel like 
you've done something careless or well,

1655
01:11:35,761 --> 01:11:37,570
everyone's done something careless.
Right.

1656
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:39,540
You know,
but I've been pretty careful.

1657
01:11:39,541 --> 01:11:40,620
I mean,
I was fortunate,

1658
01:11:40,621 --> 01:11:43,800
so when this political scandal blew up 
around me and in Canada,

1659
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:47,310
when I opposed some legislation that I 
thought was reprehensible,

1660
01:11:47,311 --> 01:11:49,170
he constructed,
um,

1661
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:50,241
you know,
the,

1662
01:11:50,241 --> 01:11:51,074
the,
the radicals on the left in particular 

1663
01:11:52,501 --> 01:11:54,510
came after me hard.
And,

1664
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:57,030
but I was fortunate because,
you know,

1665
01:11:57,031 --> 01:12:01,440
they called me every name under the book
and went after my character.

1666
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:02,453
And you know,
I suppose there was some degree of of 

1667
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,233
that was understandable to some degree 
because if you stand up against 

1668
01:12:09,151 --> 01:12:11,910
something,
if you stand up against the radical,

1669
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:14,190
right,
well maybe you're a communist might not.

1670
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:15,023
Probably not.
Cause you don't have to be a communist 

1671
01:12:16,261 --> 01:12:17,640
to not like the radical,
right.

1672
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:19,590
But if you stand up against the radical 
left,

1673
01:12:19,591 --> 01:12:21,960
well maybe you're a Nazi.
Well probably not.

1674
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:24,900
But you might be.
And so it's certainly in the interest of

1675
01:12:24,901 --> 01:12:28,710
the people who are proponents of the 
philosophy of the radical left to assume

1676
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:30,930
that you're a Nazi because then they 
don't have to deal with you.

1677
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:34,590
And so that's what happens.
You throw yourself into the fray,

1678
01:12:34,591 --> 01:12:36,870
people try to localize you.
And they do that by saying,

1679
01:12:36,871 --> 01:12:37,650
well,
maybe you're this,

1680
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:38,760
maybe you're this,
maybe this,

1681
01:12:38,761 --> 01:12:40,290
maybe you're this.
It's like,

1682
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:41,550
well yeah,
maybe not too.

1683
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:43,170
And,
and,

1684
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:47,310
but I already had 250 hours of lectures 
up on Youtube at that point.

1685
01:12:47,311 --> 01:12:48,144
So people could actually go and see what
I had said because virtually every word 

1686
01:12:50,911 --> 01:12:53,430
I'd ever said to students in a 
professional capacity,

1687
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:56,520
not on every word because I didn't tape 
every lecture,

1688
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:57,683
but I taped multiple years of lectures 
and so people went over those with a 

1689
01:13:02,521 --> 01:13:03,354
fine tooth comb,
trying to find out if there's anything 

1690
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:07,080
I'd ever said that was,
and he couldn't find anything.

1691
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,620
And that was because I'd been very 
careful with what I say.

1692
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:11,863
Um,
well,

1693
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:12,833
ever since I was about 25 I started 
paying attention to what I was saying 

1694
01:13:16,111 --> 01:13:16,944
and not,
and trying very hard not to say things 

1695
01:13:20,101 --> 01:13:23,790
that I would
try,

1696
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:24,624
not trying very hard not to say things 
that something in me objected to so and 

1697
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:34,500
well,
that seems to have been provided me with

1698
01:13:34,501 --> 01:13:37,560
a buffer.
And so people came to my website because

1699
01:13:37,561 --> 01:13:41,280
they were interested in,
well before the political stuff blew up,

1700
01:13:41,281 --> 01:13:43,920
I had a million views on youtube,
which isn't nothing.

1701
01:13:44,270 --> 01:13:45,103
1 million of anything is a lot.
But then when the political scandals 

1702
01:13:48,301 --> 01:13:49,740
started to break,
yeah,

1703
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:52,380
then people came for them but stayed for
the content.

1704
01:13:52,381 --> 01:13:54,480
And so,
and that's been really useful.

1705
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:55,403
Yeah,
well it's,

1706
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:57,080
well,
and it's not that surprising.

1707
01:13:57,081 --> 01:13:57,631
Well,
you know,

1708
01:13:57,631 --> 01:13:59,870
because of what you do,
it's like pe,

1709
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,133
there's a great hunger for information 
that is practical and useful and that 

1710
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:10,680
helps people find meaning in their lives
and orient themselves.

1711
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:11,513
There's a great hunger for that.
And most of my lectures were derived 

1712
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:17,740
from solid psychology,
some of it experimental,

1713
01:14:17,741 --> 01:14:20,050
some of that biological,
some of it from,

1714
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,480
from,
from the domains of neuroscience,

1715
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:23,523
a lot of it from great clinicians.
It's not surprising that people find it 

1716
01:14:25,871 --> 01:14:29,470
helpful because yeah,
well great clinicians were great because

1717
01:14:29,471 --> 01:14:32,470
they were really helpful.
And so to distill that into,

1718
01:14:32,471 --> 01:14:36,700
offer it to people in a digestible form,
to have that have a good effect on them.

1719
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:38,860
While that's,
that's what you'd expect,

1720
01:14:38,861 --> 01:14:40,450
that's what the whole discipline is 
about.

1721
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:42,640
And so that's been,
that's been great.

1722
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:43,503
These,
these public lectures that I've been 

1723
01:14:44,471 --> 01:14:45,304
doing,
so I've think I've done 50 of them in 

1724
01:14:47,741 --> 01:14:50,680
about 45 different cities now in about 
three months.

1725
01:14:50,681 --> 01:14:51,514
And the average theater sizes between 20
503,000 people and they're unbelievably 

1726
01:14:56,921 --> 01:15:00,190
positive events because people come 
there and we talk mostly about

1727
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:02,553
the political spectrum and why there's 
room for voices on the left and why 

1728
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:09,730
there's room for voices on the right and
where the parameters of that should be.

1729
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:10,593
Because both of those can descend into 
extremism and that's not good at the 

1730
01:15:13,511 --> 01:15:17,710
role of individual responsibility and 
individual sovereignty and the necessity

1731
01:15:17,711 --> 01:15:18,544
for people to develop a vision.
The sorts of things that we already 

1732
01:15:20,441 --> 01:15:23,590
talked about and virtually everyone 
that's coming there,

1733
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,600
they're not coming for political 
reasons.

1734
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:26,463
Even though that's the story you hear 
from the more ideologically possessed 

1735
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,370
journalist types because they see the 
world that way,

1736
01:15:33,371 --> 01:15:35,830
they can't imagine anything else could 
possibly be happening,

1737
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:37,053
but the people who are coming to these 
lectures are coming because they are 

1738
01:15:38,801 --> 01:15:43,801
doing everything they possibly can to 
make their lives better so and so.

1739
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:48,050
And it's lovely to talk to people like 
that because it is great.

1740
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:50,860
It's literally great school of greatness
baby.

1741
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,570
Right,
exactly.

1742
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:53,703
I've got six minutes to be mindful of 
your time and your schedule and I want 

1743
01:15:56,731 --> 01:15:58,960
to ask you three final questions if 
that's okay.

1744
01:15:58,960 --> 01:15:59,793
Yeah,
you bet.

1745
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:00,633
So as much as I would love for you to go
on for another few hours on these 

1746
01:16:03,281 --> 01:16:05,770
answers so I can get to the last 
question,

1747
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:08,950
I'll do my best to be brief.
I wish I could go out longer,

1748
01:16:08,951 --> 01:16:10,900
so we'll have to have you come back as 
time here in la.

1749
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:12,123
Uh,
the first one is what is your purpose 

1750
01:16:13,601 --> 01:16:16,120
now moving forward through everything 
you've had in your life?

1751
01:16:16,121 --> 01:16:18,280
What's your purpose moving forward?
While I've,

1752
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:20,520
I've specific,
uh,

1753
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:21,700
I'm,
I'm,

1754
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:25,480
what's my purpose?
What am I aiming at?

1755
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:26,890
Well,
I'm going to,

1756
01:16:26,891 --> 01:16:28,960
I did a series of Biblical lectures last
year.

1757
01:16:28,961 --> 01:16:32,650
I did 15 lectures on genesis.
I'm going to continue doing that.

1758
01:16:32,651 --> 01:16:34,840
So in November,
I'm going to start with the exodus story

1759
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:37,780
is,
and what I'd like to do over the next 15

1760
01:16:37,781 --> 01:16:41,440
years is make my way through the whole 
corpus of biblical writings.

1761
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,590
So that's one major goal.
I want to write another book.

1762
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:46,210
I,
I've written half of it already,

1763
01:16:46,211 --> 01:16:47,044
which will be a follow up to 12 rules 
for life cause I actually had laid out 

1764
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:54,480
on a site called Quora 40 rules.
And so I'll do that and write in another

1765
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:58,510
couple of books I suspect over the next 
few years.

1766
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:00,340
Um,
I,

1767
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:01,990
the touring,
I'm going to continue,

1768
01:17:01,991 --> 01:17:02,824
I have 10 cities coming up in Canada and
another 20 in the u s and then 12 in 

1769
01:17:07,481 --> 01:17:08,314
Europe and I'm going to go to Australia 
in February and then back to Europe I 

1770
01:17:11,451 --> 01:17:12,284
think in April.
So there's lots of touring on the 

1771
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:17,330
horizon and it's,
it's for the reasons I already described

1772
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:19,820
and having,
I don't,

1773
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:20,893
the lectures differ every night,
although there are themes that 

1774
01:17:22,611 --> 01:17:23,444
constantly emerge and I'm using those as
an opportunity to have a detailed and 

1775
01:17:27,111 --> 01:17:27,944
engaged discussion with the audience 
about how we might proceed forward 

1776
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:33,763
individually and collectively so that we
can make things consciously better and 

1777
01:17:38,031 --> 01:17:38,864
why that's associated with necessary 
meaning and why that's a moral 

1778
01:17:42,261 --> 01:17:43,094
obligation.

1779
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,340
So it's a dialogue about 
responsibilities and not rights,

1780
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:47,293
even though right?
Rights are only important in so far as 

1781
01:17:49,281 --> 01:17:51,650
they set up the space for you to 
shoulder,

1782
01:17:51,651 --> 01:17:54,920
you're proper responsibility.
And as a sovereign citizen,

1783
01:17:54,921 --> 01:17:55,754
you have the responsibility for the 
integrity of the state resting on your 

1784
01:17:58,701 --> 01:17:59,534
shoulders.
And it's something that if you don't 

1785
01:18:00,741 --> 01:18:01,574
take seriously,
then the state shakes and that's not 

1786
01:18:03,951 --> 01:18:04,784
good.
And so I'm trying to convey that to 

1787
01:18:05,961 --> 01:18:07,130
people.
It's like you have,

1788
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:09,710
there's actually something that you need
to do.

1789
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:13,340
You need to take care of yourself.
You need to take care of your family,

1790
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:16,280
you need to take care of your community.
And if you don't do that,

1791
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:19,250
then there'll be hell to pay.
And it's on you,

1792
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:20,630
right?
Each of us.

1793
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:23,210
And it's,
it's hard for people to grasp that while

1794
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:24,440
they don't want to,
first of all,

1795
01:18:24,441 --> 01:18:26,330
maybe because they don't want the 
responsibility,

1796
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,180
but then they don't get any meaning,
then they suffer,

1797
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,290
then they get better.

1798
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:32,210
That's not good.
So it's like,

1799
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:36,710
which of these are you going to pick?
But it's also salutary to people because

1800
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:42,200
it's useful for everyone to know that if
you don't live up to your potential,

1801
01:18:42,201 --> 01:18:43,034
that you leave a hole in the fabric of 
being and it's filled by something 

1802
01:18:46,281 --> 01:18:47,114
approximating hell.
And unless that's what you want and you 

1803
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:51,500
shouldn't be doing that.
And so,

1804
01:18:51,501 --> 01:18:52,334
and it's perfectly possible to have a 
serious discussion with 3000 people 

1805
01:18:55,521 --> 01:18:59,600
about this and there are right on board 
with it all the way.

1806
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:03,110
And so that's really something amazing 
to behold.

1807
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:07,220
And one of the things I've realized is 
all of these new technologies,

1808
01:19:07,221 --> 01:19:10,730
the technologies you're using enabled 
these long form discussions,

1809
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,920
turns out that people are smarter than 
we thought.

1810
01:19:12,921 --> 01:19:13,880
Right?
Right,

1811
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:15,410
right.
TV narrowed it,

1812
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,273
right?
30 seconds say you're complicated thing 

1813
01:19:18,141 --> 01:19:19,190
in 30 seconds.
Like,

1814
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:21,260
like can't,
yeah.

1815
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:22,423
And so we were viewing the,
the population through this narrow 

1816
01:19:26,181 --> 01:19:28,040
window and everyone looked kind of 
stupid.

1817
01:19:28,041 --> 01:19:30,440
It's like now the windows fully open.
It's like,

1818
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:31,303
Oh look at that you people like 40 hour 
netflix specials that are incredibly 

1819
01:19:37,161 --> 01:19:38,840
complex,
right?

1820
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:42,590
And you like three hour Joe Rogan 
discussions that are complicated.

1821
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,000
You'll follow the whole thing.
It's like,

1822
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:45,410
oh good,
we're smarter than we thought.

1823
01:19:45,411 --> 01:19:48,200
Thank God for that because we better be 
so.

1824
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:50,540
So that's,
that's where I'm aiming at the future.

1825
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:52,200
Got It.
Um,

1826
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:53,900
okay,
question number two,

1827
01:19:53,901 --> 01:19:56,090
this is called,
you've got the 12 rules for life.

1828
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:57,860
Make sure you guys again,
go pick it up.

1829
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,840
Uh,
get it right now.

1830
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:04,250
What's the link as well so far the 
ring.com and I put up a code,

1831
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:08,700
which is greatness,
donny percent off suite two for one.

1832
01:20:08,701 --> 01:20:13,320
So you can give the sweet to your 
friends to self self authoring.com.

1833
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:14,810
Yeah.
Not some.

1834
01:20:14,811 --> 01:20:15,644
Slash Green.
And that's just the code is the code is 

1835
01:20:17,071 --> 01:20:17,461
great.
It's,

1836
01:20:17,461 --> 01:20:18,294
yeah.
And the thing that I would say to 

1837
01:20:19,771 --> 01:20:21,510
everyone,
if you're going to try this exercise,

1838
01:20:21,511 --> 01:20:22,344
which I would recommend,
do it over a few days and don't do it 

1839
01:20:24,961 --> 01:20:26,850
perfectly,
just do it.

1840
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:29,370
Get it done,
do it bad first draft.

1841
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:29,700
Right,
right.

1842
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:30,533
Which is an important principle in life.
A bad first draft is a great thing to 

1843
01:20:33,241 --> 01:20:34,270
have.
That's good.

1844
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:36,210
Yeah.
You're also on instagram,

1845
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:37,440
twitter,
facebook.

1846
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,590
Yeah.
So we'll make all that stuff up.

1847
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:40,440
Okay.
Yep.

1848
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:42,030
And your website.
What's your main website?

1849
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:43,050
Jordan B.
Peterson.

1850
01:20:43,051 --> 01:20:44,130
Dot Call.
Perfect.

1851
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:45,023
Okay.
So make sure you guys get the book 

1852
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,130
subscribed,
everything.

1853
01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:48,323
Get the self authoring the future 
authoring for you university students 

1854
01:20:51,181 --> 01:20:52,230
out there.
Uh,

1855
01:20:52,231 --> 01:20:56,820
the future authoring program decreases 
your probability of dropout.

1856
01:20:56,821 --> 01:20:57,654
If you're in a college program,
university program by somewhere between 

1857
01:20:59,911 --> 01:21:02,820
25 and 50%,
especially if you're kind of aimless,

1858
01:21:02,821 --> 01:21:03,654
it works better if you,
if you already got a plan and you're 

1859
01:21:05,671 --> 01:21:07,560
implementing it,
you've got a good direction,

1860
01:21:07,561 --> 01:21:08,394
then you know,
it's not as helpful because you're 

1861
01:21:09,841 --> 01:21:10,770
already halfway there.

1862
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:13,230
But if you're kind of lost and you do 
this,

1863
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:16,470
it'll help you not only establish your 
goals but stick to them.

1864
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:20,910
It really helps.
We've done three very detailed published

1865
01:21:20,911 --> 01:21:23,950
peer reviewed studies showing that this 
really works powerful.

1866
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:25,350
Yeah.
And it doesn't hurt you either.

1867
01:21:25,351 --> 01:21:26,760
That's the other thing.
That's great.

1868
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:28,160
So that's great.
Uh,

1869
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:29,003
you've got the 1204 five.
I've got something called the three 

1870
01:21:30,901 --> 01:21:31,734
truths.
It's a question I ask everyone at the 

1871
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:34,720
end.
And um,

1872
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:37,540
so we're gonna try and boil this down 
for three truths for you.

1873
01:21:38,070 --> 01:21:38,903
Imagine this is your last day.
You get to choose the day for you when 

1874
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:42,500
you die.
Yup.

1875
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,100
It's many years away.
He's one of the B.

1876
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:46,980
And you've achieved your purpose.
Everything you set out,

1877
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:51,130
you aim for,
you hit the target and then Yup,

1878
01:21:51,270 --> 01:21:53,310
you pass away.
It's the last day.

1879
01:21:53,430 --> 01:21:55,020
Everyone's there.
It's a celebration.

1880
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:56,520
Yeah.
But for whatever reason,

1881
01:21:56,521 --> 01:21:59,640
there's no more videos of you up online.
There's no more lecturers,

1882
01:21:59,641 --> 01:22:02,280
no more podcasts,
no more books for whatever reason,

1883
01:22:02,281 --> 01:22:03,114
you'd have to take them with you.
So no one has access to your 

1884
01:22:05,491 --> 01:22:06,324
information,
but you get to a piece of paper and you 

1885
01:22:08,341 --> 01:22:09,174
get to write down three things you know 
to be true about your life that you 

1886
01:22:11,371 --> 01:22:12,204
would pass on.
I like to call it the three things that 

1887
01:22:14,371 --> 01:22:15,270
make you weak.

1888
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:19,650
I'm one.
Hm Hm hm.

1889
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:20,793
Lift your eyes above the horizon and aim
at the highest star that you can 

1890
01:22:23,381 --> 01:22:24,214
contemplate.

1891
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:28,520
What's the third one?

1892
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:31,920
Put Your family in order.

1893
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:33,830
Hmm.
Yeah.

1894
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:37,070
Powerful.
Before I ask the final question,

1895
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:38,750
I want to acknowledge you for a moment,
Jordan,

1896
01:22:38,751 --> 01:22:42,530
for your incredible wisdom and 
vulnerability with me.

1897
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,433
We just met.
But I feel very connected to you and 

1898
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:48,670
your mission and your purpose.
And uh,

1899
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:53,480
I just appreciate everything you've been
through as a father and as a husband,

1900
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:54,830
um,
for your,

1901
01:22:54,831 --> 01:22:56,040
for your daughter,
for your son,

1902
01:22:56,041 --> 01:22:56,874
and for your wife to continue to move on
in your own dreams and pursuit of 

1903
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:04,730
bettering humanity while going through 
all that you've gone through.

1904
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:05,920
So really knowledge,

1905
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:06,843
everything you've been doing and what 
you stand for and your ability to use 

1906
01:23:10,661 --> 01:23:11,494
your words carefully to make sure to try
and make the best impact on people who 

1907
01:23:15,641 --> 01:23:16,474
are listening.
So I'm like acknowledge you for all of 

1908
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:18,284
that.
I hope we get to have you come back 

1909
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:22,300
sometime when you're in la cause I think
we can go for another hour or two.

1910
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:23,493
Um,
and the final question is what's your 

1911
01:23:26,141 --> 01:23:27,280
definition of greatness?

1912
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:32,353
Okay.

1913
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:33,593
Well,
greatness is what reveals itself when 

1914
01:23:35,011 --> 01:23:35,844
you,

1915
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:38,670
okay.

1916
01:23:38,670 --> 01:23:43,670
When you attempt to formulate,
when you attempt to carefully articulate

1917
01:23:44,461 --> 01:23:46,140
and live out what you believe to be 
true,

1918
01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:50,910
it just happens because there isn't 
anything more powerful than truth,

1919
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:52,620
right?

1920
01:23:52,620 --> 01:23:54,870
That's the antidote to suffering truth,

1921
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:56,863
right?

1922
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:58,790
So it's a strange thing because you 
think,

1923
01:23:58,791 --> 01:23:59,321
well,
yeah,

1924
01:23:59,321 --> 01:24:01,070
it produces a lot of suffering too.
It's like,

1925
01:24:01,430 --> 01:24:02,990
yeah,
in the short term.

1926
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,353
Yeah.
So,

1927
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:05,690
yeah.
Awesome.

1928
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:06,860
Thank you,
sir.

1929
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:07,693
You Bet.
Thanks for the invitation and the 

1930
01:24:08,841 --> 01:24:10,550
opportunity.
Very nice to meet you.

1931
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:11,740
Yeah,
thank you.

1932
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:12,573
All right.
Okay.
