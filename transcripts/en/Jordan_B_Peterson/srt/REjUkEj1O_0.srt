1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,550
Okay.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,780
So I'm going to tell you today about a 
way of looking at the world that I think

3
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:13,650
is substantially different from the way 
that most people look at the world.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,543
And the way I want to tell you about 
looking at the world today is I think 

5
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:22,260
more inclusive than a standard sort of 
materialist view.

6
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:24,210
Like the standard scientific view of the
world,

7
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:27,390
of course,
is that it's made up of familiar objects

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,510
and that the world is in essence a 
material place.

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:31,823
But there's some very potent limitations
of that viewpoint despite the fact that 

10
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:42,330
it's given us tremendous power and the 
limitations are essentially as follows,

11
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,830
the essential materialist view can't 
tell us anything about consciousness,

12
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,310
which is probably the primary fact of 
experience.

13
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,683
Neuroscientists in recent years,
mostly in the last decade of being 

14
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:00,060
trying to crack the problem of 
consciousness,

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,180
and they have absolutely made no 
progress.

16
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,260
They've tried to associate consciousness
with neuronal activity,

17
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:08,094
but that seems to be an incomplete 
answer because there's many forms of 

18
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:11,424
neuronal activity in the brain that 
aren't accompanied by consciousness at 

19
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:14,544
all.
Not only do neuroscientists understand 

20
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:18,384
virtually nothing about consciousness 
and they can't even really figure out 

21
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:24,780
what it's function is and they can't 
understand why our brains would go to so

22
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:28,830
much effort to make us aware of things 
when it isn't clear at all,

23
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:29,664
that awareness is necessary for life.
Especially given that there are many 

24
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:35,250
life forms on the planet that don't seem
to be aware at all.

25
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,970
The standard materialist view is also 
insufficient.

26
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:41,670
Many other ways it's insufficient.
Philosophically,

27
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:45,990
I think as you probably all know,
because our conception that portrays the

28
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:50,190
world is made up of objects is in some 
really fundamental way dead.

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,673
I had,
it doesn't seem to have a place in it 

30
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:53,364
for human beings or a place in it for 
meaning or a mode whereby you might be 

31
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:57,864
able to conceptualize the real existence
of something like an emotion or a dream 

32
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:01,770
or a motivation.

33
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,903
All phenomena which are just as 
mysterious to neuroscientists send to 

34
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:09,900
scientists in general has consciousness.
Now,

35
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:13,830
the problem with this seems to be mostly
experiential.

36
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,180
If you have to ask people what they know
more than anything else,

37
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,740
they know,
number one,

38
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:21,390
that they're conscious.
They know.

39
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:25,560
Number two,
that their internal experiential life is

40
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:28,050
composed of emotions and motivational 
states,

41
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:28,884
which although not rational in essential
structure are so real and relevant that 

42
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:36,180
virtually everything that people do is 
predicated on them.

43
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,673
So our current viewpoint,
despite its ability to give us 

44
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:42,414
tremendous technological power,
seems to eradicate from formal 

45
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:46,074
consideration many,
many essential experiences that are 

46
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:50,520
vital to life.
In fact,

47
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:52,410
even perhaps primary.
Now,

48
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,910
I'm going to suggest to you today that 
there's an alternative viewpoint.

49
00:02:56,911 --> 00:03:01,911
And I think also it's one that although 
you may be hearing about it formally for

50
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:03,004
the first time,
is also something that you know 

51
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,343
unbelievably deeply how thousands of 
years ago playdough propose that all 

52
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,270
knowledge was remembering.

53
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,103
And of course we don't believe that 
today because we believe we gathered 

54
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:17,980
knowledge as a consequence of contact 
with the world.

55
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,190
But you'll see today that the knowledge 
that I'm going to share with you,

56
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,320
we'll strike a deep chord of 
remembering.

57
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:24,154
And it's because everything that you've 
done throughout your life is in one way 

58
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:29,620
or another predicated on what I'm going 
to tell you today.

59
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,680
I'm going to demonstrate this in a 
peculiar way,

60
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:35,470
I think because I'm going to start by 
telling you a story,

61
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,300
and the reason I'm going to do that is 
because models of the world that include

62
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:41,200
phenomena,
light,

63
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:44,170
consciousness,
and emotions and motivations and actions

64
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:45,004
and interactions are generally portrayed
formally in stories and not in 

65
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:50,584
scientific theories.
And it does turn out to be that stories 

66
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:55,420
themselves have an identifiable 
structure,

67
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:58,120
even a grammar that makes them 
comprehensible.

68
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,703
Furthermore,
it turns out that even the simplest 

69
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:02,284
stories,
especially if they're elegantly 

70
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:07,660
constructed,
have an unbelievably profound underlying

71
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:08,494
meaning,
and you can frequently see this most 

72
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:11,710
particularly in children's stories.

73
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,400
So I remember I showed my son when he 
was four years old,

74
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:16,780
the Disney movie,
Pinocchio,

75
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,930
which on the surface of it is a very 
strange tale,

76
00:04:19,931 --> 00:04:23,260
right?
It's a wooden puppet who wants to become

77
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:24,094
real,
so he has to rescue his father from the 

78
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:27,514
belly of a whale.
A structured that could by no means be 

79
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:31,294
considered rational.
That is in fact so surprising and 

80
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:37,390
unexpected that it's remarkable to 
imagine that grown men and women,

81
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,343
including children,
can sit in a movie theater and watch a 

82
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:44,950
story like that unfold without ever 
thinking for a second.

83
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,933
That it's absolutely peculiar that they 
can be taken in by such a tail and 

84
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:54,361
regard it experientially as real.
Pinocchio is a deep,

85
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:55,444
deep story.
It has echoes that go back three or 

86
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:58,324
4,000 years to the earliest stories that
we know and it's so rich with 

87
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:04,810
information that a child can watch it 
over and over and over and over.

88
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,830
I think my son Watched Pinocchio 30 
Times a why?

89
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,903
Well,
it's either because a child can't tell 

90
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:12,424
the difference between fantasy and 
reality or it's because there's 

91
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:19,630
something to those stories that's much 
more potent than we actually consciously

92
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:21,400
understand.
And it's kind of interesting too,

93
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:22,360
you know,
if you go to a,

94
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,170
if you go to a video rental 
establishment,

95
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,333
you'll find that in the top 10 highest 
grossing movies of all time are for 

96
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,830
Disney movies that are animated 
fairytales,

97
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,380
essentially retelling of mythological 
stories.

98
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,380
They strike a deep chord.
Why?

99
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,323
Well,
Shakespeare was of course a great 

100
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:42,334
literary figure,
said it perhaps better than anyone else 

101
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:46,084
has,
which is not surprising cause he said 

102
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:48,184
many things better than anyone else has.
He said all the world's a stage and all 

103
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:53,080
the men and women,
merely players,

104
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,943
they have their exits and their 
entrances and one man in his time plays 

105
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:57,680
many parts.

106
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,873
And so following from that,
you can imagine that a story is know 

107
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,624
more about the props in the world than a
play that you go see as about the props 

108
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:09,200
on the stage,
uh,

109
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,140
dramas about the manner in which people 
actually exist,

110
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:14,570
the emotions that they feel,
the motivational states they encounter,

111
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,420
the problems they have to solve when 
they interact with each other.

112
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,493
And the play's the thing from that 
particular perspective in which we can 

113
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:22,544
capture those aspects of our experience 
that are not only real but essentially 

114
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:27,584
human.
I'm going to tell you a little story to 

115
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,750
begin this off with.
It's a kid story written for children of

116
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:34,910
about four years of age,
but it's very,

117
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:37,760
very elegant.
I tried to cut it down for this talk,

118
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:38,594
but I found I couldn't because it was so
well edited that every single piece of 

119
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:44,780
it had to fit in to make the story 
complete and I'm going to show you first

120
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,280
the structure of the story.

121
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,293
Now,
this is a very useful diagram in many 

122
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:52,400
ways.
It's very simple.

123
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,300
Basically it says this,
whenever you're doing anything,

124
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,440
you inhabit a bounded world.
Now you know like for example,

125
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:01,274
you're sitting here in this lecture,
there's things you are paying attention 

126
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:03,494
to and things you're not.
If I took most of you out of this room 

127
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:09,440
right now and asked you definitively 
what color the rug was,

128
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:11,270
you would know or what color your chair 
was,

129
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:12,104
for example,
or what the person next to you was 

130
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:14,840
wearing,
and bless that person happens to be your

131
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:15,674
husband or your wife.
You wouldn't remember any of those 

132
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:18,254
things.
And the reason for that is when you're 

133
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:21,620
in a situation like this and you're 
attending to a speaker,

134
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,580
most of the occurrences that are 
unfolding around you are irrelevant.

135
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:28,520
You don't store them.
You only focus on certain things.

136
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,310
Well,
how do you decide what to focus on given

137
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:32,144
that there's,
this is virtually unlimited number of 

138
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:34,610
things to pay attention to.

139
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,263
Well,

140
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,533
you have to conceive of yourself as 
being somewhere always and you have to 

141
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:43,690
conceive of yourself as going somewhere.
So you could say,

142
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:46,540
and in a real sense,
the world you inhabit is a journey.

143
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:51,070
It's a journey from point a to point b,
a journey from what is to what should be

144
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,203
a journey from the place you are,
which is insufficient in some important 

145
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,920
manner to a place that in some important
manner is going to be better.

146
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,410
A standard story has exactly that 
structure.

147
00:08:02,411 --> 00:08:03,610
Child comes home and you say,
well,

148
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:06,310
what happened to you today on the way to
school,

149
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,413
setting up the little narrative 
structure and the child will unfold the 

150
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:10,264
sequence of events that he encountered.
If the stories more interesting than 

151
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,810
just a recount of exactly what happened 
to him.

152
00:08:16,811 --> 00:08:21,130
It usually involves the encounter with 
something unexpected on the way to point

153
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:25,420
b and a description of the manner in 
which that encounter with the unexpected

154
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,820
was resolved.
Typical story.

155
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,500
Now.
Why would you want to know that?

156
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:31,300
Why would you want to listen to it?
Well,

157
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:35,230
it's because on your journey from point 
a to point b,

158
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,960
all sorts of unexpected things always 
happen,

159
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,333
and if someone else has encountered 
something unexpected and conjured up a 

160
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:42,814
decent solution to it,
it could well be worth your time to 

161
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:46,114
listen

162
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,523
well.

163
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,310
Maybe there's a pattern to encountering 
unexpected things.

164
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:56,730
Maybe there's a proper way to encounter 
the unexpected.

165
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:59,970
Maybe it's the case that in our 
collective wisdom,

166
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:00,804
as human beings,
we've gathered up representations of 

167
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:08,070
ways to encounter the unexpected that we
put forth in our stories.

168
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,980
How should you face what you don't 
understand?

169
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,740
Well,
now I'm going to tell you this story.

170
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,173
It's written for four year old kids,
but I want you to take a look at it for 

171
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,224
a moment,
from a different perspective and see if 

172
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:24,540
you can imagine exactly what it is that 
it's saying.

173
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,943
Okay?

174
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,480
There's no such thing as a dragon.
Well,

175
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:34,440
we all know that,
right?

176
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:37,440
A dragon is a fictitious creature,
reptilian,

177
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,900
terrible lives forever,
breathes fire hordes,

178
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:46,620
Gould,
strange combination of attributes.

179
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,160
Why would something terrible and ancient
hold a treasure.

180
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,403
Billy bixby was rather surprised when he
woke up one morning and found a dragon 

181
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:04,814
in his room.
It was a small dragon about the size of 

182
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:11,681
a kitten.
The dragon wagged it's tail happily when

183
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:13,250
billy patted his head.

184
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,140
Okay.

185
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:17,921
It's interesting,
you know,

186
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:18,754
in Chinese mythology,
dragon is a positive figure in European 

187
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:24,934
mythology.
The dragon is something to face in 

188
00:10:26,531 --> 00:10:31,531
combat and destroy or something to face 
in combat and build something out of the

189
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:33,154
pieces left over from the Dragon.
Billy went downstairs to tell his 

190
00:10:37,781 --> 00:10:38,614
mother,

191
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,553
yeah,

192
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,890
there's no such thing as a dragon.
Said Billy's mother.

193
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,993
And she said it like she meant it.
I remember once my daughter had a 

194
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,760
nightmare.
She was about four.

195
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,433
This was at the time when she first 
started to notice graffiti and litter 

196
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,793
and both graffiti and her bothered her.
She couldn't understand the motivations 

197
00:10:57,711 --> 00:10:58,544
behind the graffiti artists and she 
didn't like the fact that there was 

198
00:11:01,131 --> 00:11:05,540
litter cluttering up the world's order.
And the reason she got sensitive to that

199
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,120
as a child was because children are 
really,

200
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:09,740
really dependent on order.
Right.

201
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:10,574
I mean,
and the reason for that is that their 

202
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:13,640
realm of competence is rather 
restricted.

203
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:14,474
So they'd like to see things.
Mac mass stops a little kids for 

204
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:19,730
example.
They're not happy with you if you play a

205
00:11:19,731 --> 00:11:21,710
game with them and then mess around with
the rules of the game.

206
00:11:21,711 --> 00:11:22,700
They don't like that at all.

207
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,350
They think that that's immoral activity 
to shake up the structure of the game.

208
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,080
Well anyways,
while she was pondering all this,

209
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,063
she uh,
came into our bedroom one night and 

210
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:33,590
said,
Dad,

211
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:35,210
I had a nightmare.
Now we all know,

212
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:36,380
right?
Nightmares aren't real.

213
00:11:36,381 --> 00:11:38,690
Just like dragons.
Dreams aren't real.

214
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:39,763
Of course.
Which raises the question of why in the 

215
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:41,684
world you'd bother having them six or 
seven hours a night every single day of 

216
00:11:44,811 --> 00:11:45,644
your life and why they're a recognized 
feature of animal behavior all the way 

217
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:52,490
down to the amphibian level.
She said,

218
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:54,790
I dreamt that was a clear flowing 
stream,

219
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,660
but in the stream there was all sorts of
garbage and it scared me and bothered me

220
00:11:58,661 --> 00:11:59,650
so much.
I woke up.

221
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:00,670
So I told her,
look,

222
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,260
close your eyes and imagine the stream.
It's full of garbage.

223
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,510
What should you do about it?
She said,

224
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:08,344
well,
I should take the garbage out of the 

225
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:09,140
street.

226
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,821
And I said,
all right,

227
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:12,610
so picture this dream,
picture yourself,

228
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,480
cleaning the garbage out of it.
She calmed down and went back to sleep.

229
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,500
Why?
Well,

230
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:18,334
because dreams concentrate on threat.
We know that they present threats to 

231
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:22,654
you,
threats you haven't been able to deal 

232
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,124
with.
Well,

233
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,053
there's a part of your brain that tracks
threats and it's not really all that 

234
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:29,380
smart.
In some ways,

235
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,000
all it does is say,
look,

236
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,103
here's the problem and it's waiting for 
the rest of your brain to conjure up 

237
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:35,464
some solution to that problem.
And if it doesn't conjure up a solution 

238
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:42,340
and it just presents the problem over 
and over and over and over and over.

239
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:44,650
So people who have posttraumatic stress 
disorder,

240
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:45,484
for example,
who've been really upset by their 

241
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:47,884
contact with something unexpected,
dream about the same tragedy forever 

242
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,473
until they solve it and they solve it by
facing it and living it over and over 

243
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,980
voluntarily.

244
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,220
So you might think right off the bat 
from listening to that little story that

245
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,850
suggesting to your four year old 
daughter who's just had a nightmare,

246
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:07,684
that her fears aren't real and that the 
dream representation of them isn't real 

247
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,003
because it's not tangible.
Like a table might not really be the 

248
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:18,520
best approach to the problem.
So you see billy,

249
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,160
he's pretty much got it right right off 
the bat,

250
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,620
right?
The dragon wagged his tail happily.

251
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:24,454
When billy padded it's head.
Bailey went downstairs to tell his 

252
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:31,030
mother there's no such thing as a dragon
said billy's mother,

253
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:36,031
and she said it like she meant it
till there's a dragon in this house.

254
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,833
Now the next thing he might wonder is 
how often have you actually gone into a 

255
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:41,854
house where there's a dragon?
My guess is if you don't take this 

256
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:45,544
particularly specifically and allow 
yourself to use your imagination and to 

257
00:13:48,821 --> 00:13:49,654
think metaphorically for a moment,
you've all encountered dozens of houses 

258
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:55,930
that were filled right to the rafters 
with various dragons,

259
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,063
all of which were being studiously 
ignored by the people who inhabited the 

260
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:03,730
house.
Billy went back to his room and began to

261
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:06,940
dress the dragon,
came close to billy in a friendly manner

262
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,070
and wagged his tail,
but billy didn't pat it.

263
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,130
If there's no such thing as something,
it's silly to pat it on the head.

264
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,160
Billy washed his face and hands and went
down to breakfast.

265
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,380
The dragon went along.
It was bigger.

266
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:25,381
Now almost the size of a dog
belly sat down at the table.

267
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,273
The dragon sat down on the table.
This sort of thing was not usually 

268
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:33,784
permitted,
but there wasn't much billy's mother 

269
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:35,764
could do about it.
She'd already said there was no such 

270
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:40,090
thing as a dragon and if there's no such
thing,

271
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,850
you can't tell it to get down off the 
table.

272
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,273
Sometimes I sit with friends of mine who
have very young children to eat saint 

273
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:56,630
and the children two or three years old 
don't sit out the table.

274
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:57,464
They sit on the table or they run around
the table or they run around the table 

275
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:04,250
and pull things off the table or they 
run around the house and pull things off

276
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:05,084
all the shelves in the house and keep 
their parents so busy chasing them 

277
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,190
around that they have no time 
whatsoever.

278
00:15:10,191 --> 00:15:12,440
Do we interact as adults?
Well,

279
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,453
you have to wonder under those 
circumstances whether you're dealing 

280
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:18,740
with a child or a dragon,
so to speak.

281
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,980
And you also might wonder whether or not
the dragon is large and unruly.

282
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,173
Precisely because the parents are 
completely unwilling to admit that it 

283
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:29,750
actually exists.

284
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,970
Mother made some pancakes for billy,
brought the dragon,

285
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,690
ate the mall,
mother made some more,

286
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,823
but to drag an eight those two mother 
kept making pancakes until she ran out 

287
00:15:43,561 --> 00:15:45,870
of batter.
Billy only got one of them,

288
00:15:45,871 --> 00:15:47,700
but he said that's all he really wanted.
Anyway,

289
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,133
one time,

290
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,823
ah,

291
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,413
an acquaintance of ours in Boston 
brought their son over to be Babysat at 

292
00:15:58,261 --> 00:15:59,094
our house and his nanny had just been in
a car accident so he was being shunted 

293
00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:03,600
from house to house.
Well,

294
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:07,620
his parents went off to work and uh,
he didn't have very good reputation.

295
00:16:07,621 --> 00:16:10,410
This kid,
he was about four and a,

296
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,253
he came over to our house and with his 
mother in the morning and she dropped 

297
00:16:16,391 --> 00:16:17,320
him off and she said,

298
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,350
well,
he probably won't eat all day,

299
00:16:20,351 --> 00:16:22,540
but that's all right.
Oh and I thought,

300
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,930
no,
he's four.

301
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,640
If he doesn't eat all day,
ah,

302
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,370
that's not all right.
Right.

303
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:31,204
Cause kids,
if they don't eat their basically 

304
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:33,540
horrible,
right.

305
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,600
If they don't sleep,
they don't eat.

306
00:16:34,601 --> 00:16:35,434
They're horrible.
So it isn't all right that he doesn't 

307
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:37,571
eat.
So then you think,

308
00:16:37,571 --> 00:16:38,404
well maybe there's some sort of dragon 
associated with this child that happens 

309
00:16:41,621 --> 00:16:44,350
to be interviewing perhaps with his 
ability to eat.

310
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,573
So I came back at noon,
my wife had taken care of the children 

311
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,513
that day and I walked in the house and 
the other four or five kids that we had 

312
00:16:52,571 --> 00:16:53,404
in house were off playing.
And this little kid was standing in the 

313
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,940
corner,
like really isolated and looking,

314
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,610
you know,
upset fundamentally.

315
00:17:00,611 --> 00:17:01,444
So I went over and I poked him a bunch 
because generally if you poke a kid a 

316
00:17:04,181 --> 00:17:05,014
little bit,
you know,

317
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,610
well they'll go like this,
you know,

318
00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:07,444
the sort of back off.
But sooner or later you can crack them 

319
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:11,710
and they'll smile and then they'll play.
Not this kid,

320
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:12,544
boy,
there's no bloody way who's going to 

321
00:17:12,971 --> 00:17:13,804
play with me?
And that was like he'd already learned 

322
00:17:15,671 --> 00:17:16,504
that adults should either be ignored or 
that they were trouble and he wasn't 

323
00:17:21,221 --> 00:17:23,200
gonna let any adult into his little 
world.

324
00:17:23,201 --> 00:17:24,034
So there was absolutely a dragon 
associated with that little boy and it 

325
00:17:27,071 --> 00:17:28,570
was eating all his pancakes.

326
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,100
Billy went upstairs to brush his teeth.
Mother started clearing the table.

327
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,890
The dragon who was quite as big as 
mother by this time,

328
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,200
made himself comfortable on the whole 
rug and went to sleep.

329
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,290
I really like this one.
By the time billy came back downstairs,

330
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,390
the dragon had grown so much.
He filled the hall.

331
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:49,703
Billy had to go around by way of the 
living room to get to where his mother 

332
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:52,794
was.
I didn't know dragon's group's who fast 

333
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:57,120
said billy,
there's no such thing as a dragon.

334
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:58,290
Said mother firmly

335
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,180
cleaning the downstairs took mother all 
morning.

336
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,520
Well with the dragon in the way and 
having to climb in and out of windows to

337
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,680
get from room to room.
So you know,

338
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,473
you think back in your own experience 
when you've gone to a house where 

339
00:18:15,401 --> 00:18:16,234
there's a dragon hiding underneath the 
living room rug and nobody's saying 

340
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,980
anything about it.
And then you think,

341
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:26,250
how long does it take to get something 
absolutely simple done in a house that's

342
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:31,030
absolutely jammed to the rafters with 
unfinished business forever,

343
00:18:31,031 --> 00:18:31,864
right?
Organizing people in a household like 

344
00:18:33,341 --> 00:18:34,174
that to even do something as simple as 
go out for breakfast in the morning or 

345
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:40,000
even perhaps to make a meal is virtually
impossible.

346
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,100
Why?
Well,

347
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:42,934
because there's something going on in 
the household that has been studiously 

348
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:47,464
ignored for a very long time and has 
grown so large as a consequence that it 

349
00:18:51,701 --> 00:18:56,701
occupies the whole domain.
By noon,

350
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,200
the dragon filled the house.
It's head hung out the front door.

351
00:19:02,201 --> 00:19:03,034
It's tail hung out the back door and 
there wasn't a room in the house that 

352
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:07,360
didn't have some part of the dragon in 
it.

353
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,140
When the dragon awoke from his nap,
he was hungry.

354
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,873
You Bake for truck went by.
The smell of fresh bread was more than 

355
00:19:20,921 --> 00:19:21,754
the dragon could resist.
He ran down the street after the bakery 

356
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,750
truck.
The house went along.

357
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:27,460
Of course,
like the shell on a snail.

358
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,880
The mailman was just coming up the path 
with some mail for the big speeds.

359
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:43,750
When their house rushed past him and 
headed down the street,

360
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,700
he chased the big space.
How has for a few blocks,

361
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:47,200
but he,
but he couldn't catch it.

362
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,983
When mister bixby came home for lunch,
the first thing he noticed was that his 

363
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:58,640
house was gone.
Luckily one of the neighbors was able to

364
00:19:58,641 --> 00:20:00,420
tell them which way it went.
You know,

365
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,280
that sort of thing happens to people not
infrequently to write,

366
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,173
hey,
they're not really looking around much 

367
00:20:07,161 --> 00:20:07,994
at what's going on and they come home 
from work one day and their house is 

368
00:20:11,061 --> 00:20:12,500
gone.
And what does that mean?

369
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,423
Well,
maybe their children have become 

370
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:20,210
completely alienated from them or maybe 
their wife has decided suddenly,

371
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,880
but of course not.
So suddenly to leave.

372
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,580
Why?
Well,

373
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:26,443
according to this story,
it's because something ignored was 

374
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:33,551
growing in the house.
Mr Bixby in his car and went looking for

375
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,274
the house.
He studied all the houses as he drove 

376
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:38,760
along.
Finally he saw one that looked familiar.

377
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,820
Billy and Mrs Bixby,
we're waving from an upstairs window.

378
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,183
Okay.

379
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,010
You know when in the 1890s in India when
a house was being built,

380
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,473
the local priest equivalent to the 
priest would come by to set the 

381
00:20:58,441 --> 00:21:01,140
foundation stone.
And when he set the foundation stone,

382
00:21:01,141 --> 00:21:04,740
he take a big spike and drove it into 
the ground.

383
00:21:04,741 --> 00:21:07,890
And the reason he drove it into the 
ground at the place where the foundation

384
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,724
was going to be laid was to keep the 
great dragon that is underneath the 

385
00:21:11,401 --> 00:21:12,234
earth.
Firmly pinned down by its head so it 

386
00:21:14,701 --> 00:21:17,070
couldn't move and shake the house to 
bits.

387
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,930
And what does that mean?
Well,

388
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,333
it means the same thing that's meant in 
the new testament when you're told not 

389
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:24,630
to build your house on a foundation of 
sand,

390
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:25,464
right?
It doesn't matter how good the house is 

391
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:30,030
or how well constructed it is or how 
rich it is.

392
00:21:30,031 --> 00:21:34,260
If the foundation has made out of sand 
or if it rests on top of a dragon,

393
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,320
there's nothing in that household that's
ever going to be accomplished.

394
00:21:37,321 --> 00:21:39,600
That's positive.
And the wealth,

395
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:43,320
the display that the house might consist
of is nothing but a sham.

396
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,103
Mr Bixby climbed over the dragon's head 
onto the porch roof and through the 

397
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:53,860
upstairs window.
How did this happen?

398
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,240
Mr Bixby asked.
It was the dragon said,

399
00:21:58,241 --> 00:22:00,850
billy,
there's no such thing.

400
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,150
Mother started to say,
there is a dragon.

401
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,690
Billy insisted a very big dragon and 
billy patted the dragon on the head.

402
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:16,650
The dragon wagged his tail happily then 
even faster than it had grown.

403
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,860
The dragon started getting smaller.
Soon it was kitten size again.

404
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,070
I don't mind dragons this side said,
mother,

405
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,330
why did it have to grow so big?
I'm not sure I said billy,

406
00:22:41,331 --> 00:22:43,340
but I think it just want it to be 
noticed.

407
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,053
So the first thing you might think about
is just what happens if you don't pay a 

408
00:22:53,191 --> 00:22:55,440
bill?
Like really don't pay it.

409
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,420
Right?
I mean when it first comes in,

410
00:22:57,421 --> 00:22:58,254
it's only the size of a kitten.
But if you leave it alone for two or 

411
00:23:00,571 --> 00:23:01,404
three years,
it's pretty much grows into a full 

412
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:03,880
fledge dragon.
Well,

413
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,190
why?
Well,

414
00:23:05,191 --> 00:23:09,270
because things that you ignore have a 
life of their own complex life,

415
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:13,590
like a bill bills attached to a whole 
industrial complex,

416
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:14,424
right?
One of whose major functions is to make 

417
00:23:16,681 --> 00:23:19,560
sure that you pay the bill and if you 
don't pay the bill,

418
00:23:19,561 --> 00:23:22,380
then you immediately find out what it's 
connected to.

419
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,600
It's connected to something,
a Manson,

420
00:23:24,601 --> 00:23:25,434
very troublesome.
And if you allow all the full force of 

421
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:29,430
that thing to manifest itself,
it's not pretty.

422
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,900
So one lesson from this story is that if
something's nagging at you just a bit,

423
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,103
it's probably better to deal with it 
before it turns into a full fledge 

424
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:43,200
dragon.

425
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,040
And then you might think,
well,

426
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,280
what if it's already full fledge dragon,
right?

427
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:47,430
I mean,
then what's your option?

428
00:23:47,431 --> 00:23:49,640
And this is there is nothing left but to
run away.

429
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:54,680
And so then I can tell you what we know 
from 50 years of studying the outcome of

430
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:58,670
clinical psychological interventions.
So let's take an extreme case,

431
00:23:58,671 --> 00:23:59,504
right?
Let's say something truly terrible has 

432
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:03,230
happened to you.
And as a consequence of that,

433
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:08,231
you're in shock post traumatic shock,
which is a condition that's sufficiently

434
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,370
serious to damage your brain over time.
It's not only a psychological disorder,

435
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:15,650
it's a physical disorder.
If you're really stressed,

436
00:24:15,651 --> 00:24:19,550
your cortisol levels shoot up.
And if your cortisol level shoot up that

437
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:21,860
cortisol and high dose,
this is a neurotoxin,

438
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:22,694
it starts to damage your brain.
So let's take a very extreme case and 

439
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:28,940
imagine that you've been violently 
sexually assaulted.

440
00:24:28,941 --> 00:24:31,520
And as a consequence of that,
you're in post traumatic shock.

441
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,563
How do you get cured?
So that means you can't really go 

442
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:35,594
outside.
You certainly can't encounter anything 

443
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:37,334
that's associated with the event.
Your sense of integrity and personal 

444
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:41,084
safety of being completely destroyed.
Is there any way you can get back on 

445
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:44,924
your feet and all?
There's a woman named Edna Foa in New 

446
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,943
York,
I think one of the world's top clinical 

447
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:50,714
psychologist and she's been dealing with
women who have post traumatic stress 

448
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:53,834
disorder for decades and she's found a 
treatment that works and the treatment 

449
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:03,980
is this.
She has the women relive the event in as

450
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:04,814
much detail as possible over and over in
their imagination with the accompanying 

451
00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:10,184
emotion and she's found because she's 
done physiological measurements on her 

452
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:13,544
clients,
that those women that allow themselves 

453
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:19,040
to get the most fully upset as a 
consequence of the reliving get better,

454
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:19,874
faster and stay better longer.
The clinical evidence is absolutely 

455
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:25,940
clear.
When you take someone to therapy,

456
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,890
you're basically doing two things to 
them.

457
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,060
Well,
three,

458
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,893
you allow them to confess what's wrong 
with them because it's really useful to 

459
00:25:31,971 --> 00:25:34,250
actually say what it is that's bothering
you.

460
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:35,084
It makes it clear and distinct.
You help the person get their story 

461
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:41,690
straight because you have to have your 
story straight,

462
00:25:41,691 --> 00:25:42,524
right?
You have to know where you're coming 

463
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:43,904
from and you have to know where you're 
going because otherwise there's no 

464
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:46,424
structure for your life.
Then the third thing is if your path 

465
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,190
from point a to b is being blocked by 
something that you're afraid of,

466
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,160
you better learn to confront it because 
if you don't,

467
00:25:58,970 --> 00:25:59,803
it will grow and expand until it turns 
into the kind of dragon that occupies 

468
00:26:03,501 --> 00:26:04,340
your whole house.

469
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,460
This is another representation of a 
story that's a simple story.

470
00:26:14,461 --> 00:26:17,950
I think it's one that's really most 
applicable to children at.

471
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,110
There are aspects of it that are most 
applicable to children.

472
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,060
Sexual desire.
One obviously isn't.

473
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,223
It's a map of motivation.
It basically says this and it's easy to 

474
00:26:28,811 --> 00:26:30,880
understand.
If you think go to a movie,

475
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,470
it doesn't matter what country it's 
made.

476
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,840
There's certain things that always 
happen,

477
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:37,240
right?
Like two broad classes of fiction,

478
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,133
adventure and romance.
What's an adventure to go to new lands 

479
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:43,770
and discover something new and become 
transformed a consequence.

480
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:44,604
What's a romance to meet another person 
who's certainly as complicated as 

481
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:51,210
anything you could meet on an adventure.
And again,

482
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:55,410
to be transformed as a consequence of 
the contact to fundamental plots.

483
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,453
Why?
Why are there fundamental plots and why 

484
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:02,300
can we understand them without them 
being explained to us what it's,

485
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:05,010
because fundamentally we're all very,
very similar.

486
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,570
We have a finite set of basic needs.
So for example,

487
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,003
hot people would rather be cool,
thirsty people would rather have water 

488
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,710
hungry,
people would rather eat.

489
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:20,700
And these motivations color what we 
conceive of as our ultimate destiny.

490
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:22,350
So in the Old Testament,
for example,

491
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,573
an agrarian community,
often hungry paradise was construed as 

492
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:28,620
the land of milk and honey.
Well,

493
00:27:28,621 --> 00:27:29,610
why?
Well,

494
00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:33,090
milk is high in fat and honey is high in
glucose.

495
00:27:33,091 --> 00:27:34,800
And if you're hungry,
really hungry,

496
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,040
there's nothing you want more than fat 
and sugar.

497
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,840
Affiliative desire,
we like to be around other people,

498
00:27:43,841 --> 00:27:44,674
sexual desire,
a fundamental sub element of a romantic 

499
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:48,364
plot.
These underlying motivational systems 

500
00:27:49,991 --> 00:27:54,991
have ours set us up.
Bounded world within which we live.

501
00:27:55,121 --> 00:27:57,820
So for example,
if you fall in love with someone and you

502
00:27:57,821 --> 00:28:00,070
construe your destiny as being with 
them,

503
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,353
any indication that they're pleased with
you is going to produce a rash of 

504
00:28:04,871 --> 00:28:06,370
positive emotion.
Why?

505
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,443
Because our emotional systems are set up
so that any sign that we're moving 

506
00:28:10,631 --> 00:28:15,631
towards our goal is responded to with a 
rush of positive emotion and conversely,

507
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,163
a frown from the person that you love,
especially in the initial ages of an 

508
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:25,600
initial stages of a romance is met with 
a flood of negative effect.

509
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:26,943
Why?

510
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,560
Because anything that stops us on the 
path that we've chosen produces negative

511
00:28:33,561 --> 00:28:34,394
emotion.
That's how we're set up and our 

512
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,390
emotional systems are actually quite 
straight forward.

513
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,590
We pause it.
A goal.

514
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,800
The thing about people is that we can 
pause it virtually anything as a goal.

515
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,590
That's one of the things that 
distinguishes us from animals,

516
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:46,424
so we can all be thrilled to death when 
our favorite soccer team scores a goal 

517
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,380
because we participate in what they're 
doing.

518
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:56,060
The same way we participate in watching 
a protagonist on a movie or in a book,

519
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,070
we can feel it.
We embody it.

520
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:58,933
We even know now that the neural systems
that I utilize to watch a movie involve 

521
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:06,740
the same neural systems that the actor 
is utilizing,

522
00:29:06,741 --> 00:29:07,574
acting out the part.
So when you say you understand someone 

523
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:10,514
else,
what you mean is your body is set to do 

524
00:29:13,221 --> 00:29:14,450
exactly the same thing.

525
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:15,283
Their body is and your emotional systems
are locked on exactly the same way 

526
00:29:18,471 --> 00:29:19,304
there's are.
So when they experience something and 

527
00:29:20,201 --> 00:29:22,550
you're watching it,
you experienced an echo of it.

528
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,533
And that's what understanding means.
And it turns out as well that those 

529
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:27,194
neural systems that allow us to embody 
someone else and to imitate them are 

530
00:29:31,071 --> 00:29:35,120
right underneath the structures that 
we've evolved to use for language.

531
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,073
And what that indicates is that mostly 
what we use language for is to tell 

532
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:43,960
stories,
to tell about the way that people act so

533
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:46,930
that we can derive information not about
what the world's made of.

534
00:29:46,931 --> 00:29:49,660
Cause we don't really care about that 
some fundamental way,

535
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,540
but instead,
how should we act?

536
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,200
That's the fundamental question.
How should we act now?

537
00:29:56,201 --> 00:30:01,201
If you go see a movie about a thug,
the message there is given that the thug

538
00:30:02,571 --> 00:30:05,930
generally comes to not so good and don't
act like a thug.

539
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,430
Right?
Interesting.

540
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,980
Though it might be compelling as a 
lifestyle,

541
00:30:09,981 --> 00:30:12,050
at least sufficiently compelling,
so you'll watch it.

542
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:17,380
It's not a good longterm strategy.
What is a good long term strategy?

543
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,073
You know,
we've been collecting stories as people 

544
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,680
we don't know how long really,
we don't know,

545
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:28,040
a hundred thousand years maybe.
There's being creatures like us,

546
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:28,874
indistinguishable from us for 100,000 
years and we know that society's that 

547
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:37,670
appear to be more or less as archaic as 
those old societies tell stories,

548
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,440
have rituals,
have mythology.

549
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,950
We have ancient written stories like the
Enuma Elish,

550
00:30:42,951 --> 00:30:44,990
which is a Sumerian story,
the oldest written story.

551
00:30:44,991 --> 00:30:45,824
We have 4,000 years old based on a oral 
tradition that's probably 20,000 years 

552
00:30:51,321 --> 00:30:52,154
older than that.
We've been collecting stories for a 

553
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:54,650
long,
long time.

554
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,260
What do they mean?
What are they good for?

555
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,421
Well,
imagine this,

556
00:31:00,421 --> 00:31:02,730
you know,
you tell a story to your husband or your

557
00:31:02,731 --> 00:31:03,330
wife,
Hey,

558
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,460
but something interesting that you saw,
right?

559
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,503
Well then imagine that you could collect
a thousand of the most interesting 

560
00:31:09,871 --> 00:31:13,260
stories and then imagine that you were 
some kind of literary genius like,

561
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,683
like Shakespeare.
And you could take those thousand 

562
00:31:15,871 --> 00:31:20,871
interesting stories and boil them down 
to a hundred really interesting stories.

563
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,953
And then imagine that you had 10,000 
years to gather up those hundred most 

564
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:25,914
interesting stories and average them.
And you could come out with one perfect 

565
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,780
story,
the best story,

566
00:31:30,781 --> 00:31:33,690
the most interesting story that you 
could possibly tell.

567
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,430
Well,
that's what a myth is.

568
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,520
It's the most interesting story you can 
possibly tell.

569
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,160
And just as this little story that I 
just told you,

570
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:43,320
how to an underlying mythological 
structure,

571
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,190
virtually every story you ever see has 
such a structure.

572
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,233
That's why it's compelling to you.
And when you meet someone who's 

573
00:31:50,401 --> 00:31:53,940
charismatic or who holds your attention 
or who you're interested in,

574
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:58,320
the probability that they're acting out 
a mythological fragment is very,

575
00:31:58,321 --> 00:32:00,900
very high.
And that's why it is that your attention

576
00:32:00,901 --> 00:32:02,070
is captivated by them.

577
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,810
What's the world like from this 
perspective?

578
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:07,981
Well,
look,

579
00:32:07,981 --> 00:32:09,240
you know,
you're all sitting in this room.

580
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:11,520
You think if I took out of here,
how would you describe it?

581
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,290
Well,
you'd say it was full of chairs.

582
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:15,720
There was a table lights.
Well,

583
00:32:15,721 --> 00:32:17,700
why would you pick that level of 
resolution?

584
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,750
They like,
why wouldn't you say,

585
00:32:18,751 --> 00:32:19,531
well,
you know,

586
00:32:19,531 --> 00:32:23,670
the average ceiling tile had about 
15,000 dots on it.

587
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,730
It doesn't seem like a relevant data 
point,

588
00:32:26,731 --> 00:32:28,200
right?
You say the same thing about the rug.

589
00:32:28,201 --> 00:32:29,034
There's no nothing stopping you from 
counting the number of stains or the 

590
00:32:31,771 --> 00:32:32,604
number of red spots or the way the light
plays off your partner's shirt or the 

591
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,880
shine on your shoes and if you are an 
artist say,

592
00:32:38,881 --> 00:32:40,790
and to make a representation of this 
room,

593
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,773
you'd concentrate on aspects of it were 
completely different from those that 

594
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:44,990
you're concentrating on.

595
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:48,530
Now you talk about chairs,
TV cameras,

596
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,060
cabinets,
tables,

597
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,940
why they're functional.
They're objects,

598
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:53,930
right?
Their tools,

599
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,090
they're tools there.
Things you can use.

600
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:59,180
Normally when you're going from point a 
to point B,

601
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,300
you divide up the world into things you 
can use.

602
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,330
Those are things you see your perceptual
systems do,

603
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:09,620
this things you can use and things that 
might get in the way.

604
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,040
And as you move from motivated world to 
motivated world,

605
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:13,874
the little stories that you inhabit,
he chopped the world up in different 

606
00:33:15,741 --> 00:33:16,574
paces.
So a piano for a concert pianist is 

607
00:33:19,071 --> 00:33:19,904
different as a different phenomenon than
a piano for someone who has no musical 

608
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:23,984
education,
but you're always passing up the world 

609
00:33:25,911 --> 00:33:28,960
in terms of what it's good for,
how it can serve your purposes,

610
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:32,870
and you even see it that way.
Now the question is,

611
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,693
the complicated question isn't so much,
how do you parse up the world into 

612
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:39,410
things that are useful to you?
Like chairs.

613
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,383
The complicated question is what do you 
do when something that you don't expect 

614
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:46,904
happens?
So imagine you've had a 15 year long 

615
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:50,984
marriage
and you find lipstick on your husband's 

616
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,263
color.
Not once but three times and then you 

617
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:00,764
think,
well,

618
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,170
I thought I had a map,
right?

619
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,693
I thought we were both in the same game.
I thought we were both going from point 

620
00:34:08,911 --> 00:34:09,744
a to the same point B.
I thought we had established a shared 

621
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,643
structure of interpretation,
but I find that there's some aspect of 

622
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:21,300
his apparent behavior that's completely 
outside my scope of interpretation.

623
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:23,250
What do you do while you can choose to 
ignore that,

624
00:34:23,251 --> 00:34:24,420
right?
It's easy to do that.

625
00:34:24,421 --> 00:34:26,040
Why would you not?
Why would you ignore it?

626
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:30,210
Because if you don't ignore it,
you have to think he's not who I thought

627
00:34:30,211 --> 00:34:31,044
he was.
And that's really not a good thing to 

628
00:34:32,491 --> 00:34:34,230
think because people are really,
really,

629
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,123
really complicated.
And if they're not who you think they 

630
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:39,480
are,
you have no idea who they might be.

631
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,250
And you also might think,
well,

632
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,593
maybe I'm not who I think I am because 
after all I got sucked into this 

633
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,553
situation.
I thought I had pretty much understood 

634
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,044
the world.
And it turns out that I certainly don't 

635
00:34:50,641 --> 00:34:51,474
understand the opposite gender.
And there's some indication that I 

636
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:57,750
really don't even understand myself 
because fundamentally I'm so clueless.

637
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,130
And then you might think,
well,

638
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,023
when did this start?
This cluelessness how long have I been 

639
00:35:02,521 --> 00:35:03,570
blind?
Well,

640
00:35:03,571 --> 00:35:06,120
do you really want to ask that question 
will not generally.

641
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:06,954
Right.
It's easier to keep the dragon in the 

642
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,200
closet,
which is where it tends to live.

643
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:14,100
What happens when you encounter 
something you don't?

644
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:27,380
For a long time psychologist thought 
that people learned fear,

645
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,180
right?
So your typical person,

646
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,140
your typical lab rat was a common 
creature.

647
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,753
Now it's a funny thing and because if 
you take a lab rat out of his cage and 

648
00:35:38,491 --> 00:35:40,470
you put them in a new cage where you 
want to teach him,

649
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:41,304
say to be afraid of something,
to be afraid of a light paired with a 

650
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:44,004
shock,
which is a typical psychological 

651
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:47,710
experiment.
The funny thing about the rat is you got

652
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:51,450
to let him calm down before he's normal.
Well,

653
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:54,960
except that you might think that the not
comrade is also the normal route,

654
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:55,794
right?
You take the rat out of this cage and 

655
00:35:56,551 --> 00:35:58,380
you put them in the new cage and what 
does he do?

656
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,980
He goes like this.
Well,

657
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,050
why?
Well,

658
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:02,040
he's a rat,
right?

659
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:02,874
Someone might eat him.
So he's a bit nervous about being in 

660
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:05,880
this new situation.

661
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,340
Rats do not like being in new 
situations.

662
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,323
They don't like bright light.
If you put them in a new situation 

663
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:13,440
that's brightly lit,
they go right over to the corner because

664
00:36:13,441 --> 00:36:14,274
they think maybe cats won't find them.
Rats are so afraid of cats that they 

665
00:36:17,461 --> 00:36:19,860
never even have to meet a cat to be 
afraid of them.

666
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:23,010
So you can take a rat that's never seen 
a cat in his life.

667
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,920
And if you let him smell some cat odor 
or show him a cat,

668
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,270
he'll,
well,

669
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:29,910
I'll tell you,
if you show a route,

670
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,310
a cat somewhere,
he doesn't expect it.

671
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:37,770
He will run back to his burrow and 
scream for 24 hours.

672
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:42,000
Now you imagine how scared you'd have to
be to screen for 24 hours,

673
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:44,190
especially given rattle.
He lives about a year.

674
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,740
So that would be for you,
like screaming,

675
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,650
that'd be like screaming for three 
months.

676
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,543
Right?

677
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:56,700
So the rat runs back to his burrow and 
he screams and every other rat who hears

678
00:36:56,701 --> 00:36:57,990
him scream,
freezes.

679
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:02,370
And they all stay like that for 24 hours
until they sort of calm down.

680
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,013
And then the first thing they do is they
go back to the place where they saw the 

681
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:09,330
cat and they start to map it out so they
do these things called corner runs,

682
00:37:09,331 --> 00:37:12,120
which is so the rat and wants to go back
to this territory.

683
00:37:12,121 --> 00:37:12,954
He knows the territory.
It might be a place where he gets food 

684
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:18,030
is the cat's still there while you might
think stay in the borough,

685
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:18,864
right,
but then maybe you don't get something 

686
00:37:19,621 --> 00:37:20,454
to eat so the rat goes back to the place
where the cap was carefully and then he 

687
00:37:25,471 --> 00:37:26,304
hunches down and he runs over part of it
and if nothing kills him then he goes 

688
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:30,774
back and does the same thing with a 
little more of the territory until 

689
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:34,800
finally the rats of running all over the
territory again.

690
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,610
Then they go back to eating,
making love,

691
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,653
paying attention to their families 
because rats are quite social despite 

692
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,043
the fact that they're rat
the rat smart enough to go back to the 

693
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:48,510
scene of the crime,
so to speak.

694
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:50,040
Right.
It's not going to let the dragon,

695
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:50,874
that might be their grow.
The rat knows that if something is 

696
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:55,310
terrifying,
it should be investigated,

697
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,370
not run away from.

698
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:00,083
The question is what do you encounter 
when you encounter something you don't 

699
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:03,840
expect and so you say,
well,

700
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:05,640
you've got your spouse mapped out,
right?

701
00:38:05,641 --> 00:38:07,230
But then they do something you don't 
expect,

702
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,030
which hopefully happens fairly 
regularly,

703
00:38:09,031 --> 00:38:09,864
right?
Because otherwise you get bored with 

704
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:11,304
them.
They do something you don't expect and 

705
00:38:12,511 --> 00:38:13,760
you think,
Aha,

706
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,960
who is that person?
Precisely.

707
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:16,943
And what that means is that what,
what that means is that when you 

708
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:23,760
encounter something unexpected,
you actually can't see what's there.

709
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,820
Why?
Because it's too complicated.

710
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,863
You might have to spend a month talking 
to your spouse to figure out just 

711
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:34,830
exactly why they have that particular 
peculiar opinion.

712
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,350
You have to explore and dig to find out 
how they map the world.

713
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,393
If you encounter something unexpected,
the first thing you see is not the 

714
00:38:41,951 --> 00:38:42,784
world.
The first thing you see is just a sense 

715
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:46,444
of discomfort and fear combined with 
some late and curiosity that the world 

716
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:53,080
is not the way you thought it was.

717
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:54,963
Now,
how do you find out what the world is 

718
00:38:56,561 --> 00:38:59,050
actually like?
We have to investigate it.

719
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,870
You have to investigate.
It means you have to take a risk.

720
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:02,704
You have to move forward.
The same way that people do in 

721
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:04,564
psychotherapy,
you have to find the thing that you're 

722
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,850
bordering on avoiding and going and map 
it.

723
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,320
Now,
it's a curious thing.

724
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:14,110
You know,
common anxiety disorders,

725
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:14,944
agora phobia,
Agora phobia is a generalized anxiety 

726
00:39:18,221 --> 00:39:19,054
disorder,
and people who suffer severely from 

727
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:24,460
Agora Phobia often get to the point 
where because of their panics,

728
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,863
they're housebound.
They can't go outside their room or 

729
00:39:28,181 --> 00:39:29,050
their house.
Now,

730
00:39:29,051 --> 00:39:31,270
they'd run away from their room or their
house too if they could,

731
00:39:31,271 --> 00:39:32,104
but there's nowhere to run.
So they're pretty much stuck being 

732
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:36,040
somewhere.
So

733
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,150
an agoraphobic comes in for therapy,
I think,

734
00:39:40,151 --> 00:39:40,984
well,
what do you do with them?

735
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,041
And you say,
well,

736
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:44,020
then I agoraphobic says I can't go on 
elevators.

737
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,341
And you say,
okay,

738
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:48,040
well let's go try.
And you say,

739
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:48,874
all right,
well

740
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,660
relax.
It's teach the person to breathe.

741
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,400
It's really,
it doesn't help that much,

742
00:39:54,401 --> 00:39:57,310
but it makes them feel better.
You can do this without teaching them to

743
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,750
relax.
It doesn't matter a bit,

744
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:01,120
but it does help them feel better.
You say,

745
00:40:01,121 --> 00:40:02,430
okay,
well there's the elevator saying,

746
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,720
how close can you get to the elevator?
They say,

747
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:05,021
well,
I,

748
00:40:05,021 --> 00:40:05,854
you know,
I can't really get more than like 20 

749
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:08,590
feet.
That's maximum.

750
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:08,891
I said,
well,

751
00:40:08,891 --> 00:40:09,724
okay,
let's just go up to 20 feet there and I 

752
00:40:12,341 --> 00:40:13,174
may do that.
And then you let them stand there and 

753
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,280
stand there and stand there and stand 
there and stand there.

754
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:20,620
And sooner or later they get bored of 
being 20 feet from the elevator.

755
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,270
And then you say,
well look,

756
00:40:22,271 --> 00:40:22,720
you know,
let,

757
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,580
let's,
couldn't you go 10 feet?

758
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,890
And I didn't know I couldn't go 10 feet.
That's too close.

759
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,140
How about,
could you go three more feet?

760
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,310
Yeah,
I think I could do that.

761
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,383
So they go three more feet and then he 
let them stand there and they find out 

762
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:36,190
nothing terrible is happening sooner or 
later.

763
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,460
And then they go another three feet and 
then they go another three feet and then

764
00:40:39,461 --> 00:40:40,294
they're,
they're like confronting the elevator 

765
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:45,490
and then they're inside the elevator.
But they're going like this because they

766
00:40:45,491 --> 00:40:47,140
don't want to look at the elevator.
Right?

767
00:40:47,141 --> 00:40:47,771
So you say,
well,

768
00:40:47,771 --> 00:40:49,690
you've got to look at the elevator.
You can look at the numbers.

769
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:51,970
You got to look at the buttons.
Um,

770
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,740
so they do that.
Then you think,

771
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:55,090
well,
could we go up a floor?

772
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,680
No,
we couldn't go up and floor.

773
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,880
Okay,
well I'll tell you what,

774
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,290
we'll just close the door.

775
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,360
I'll put my hand and it'll open again.
Could you do that?

776
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,283
Yeah,
I could do that step by step sooner 

777
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,490
later.
And usually sooner.

778
00:41:06,491 --> 00:41:07,570
Bang.
They've gone up a floor.

779
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,980
Right?
So then what happens?

780
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,253
They go home and have a fight with her 
husband that's been brewing for like 15 

781
00:41:13,811 --> 00:41:15,250
years.
Why?

782
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:16,563
Well,
it's not because the elevators 

783
00:41:17,171 --> 00:41:20,380
symbolically related to the fight has 
nothing to do with it.

784
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:26,140
It's because what the person learns in 
the combat with the unknown,

785
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,570
which just happens to be taking the 
guise of an elevator,

786
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:29,643
is that they can confront things that 
frightened them without being destroyed 

787
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:35,540
by the confrontation.
And so what you see immediately,

788
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:38,540
and this was contrary to in the original
psychoanalytic prediction,

789
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:39,860
is that man,
you know,

790
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:41,330
you take that person out and you teach 
them,

791
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:42,164
they can go on the elevator and right 
off the bat they're going to shopping 

792
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:45,500
malls,
they're in taxis,

793
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:48,740
they're back in the subway and they're 
standing up for themselves at home.

794
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,720
Generalization.
Why?

795
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,660
Because they didn't learn that the 
elevator wasn't frightening.

796
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,063
How doesn't let they learned,
they learned that despite the fact that 

797
00:41:57,561 --> 00:42:00,440
the elevator was this terrifying as 
anything they've ever encountered,

798
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,453
they were actually up to the challenge.
And now that's a really useful thing to 

799
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:05,301
teach someone,
right?

800
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:08,720
Because have you have an obsessive 
compulsive patient?

801
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,460
Now?
I had one who actually used to work with

802
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:11,294
radiation or he was Tara.
He worked in some kind of bio lab in 

803
00:42:14,301 --> 00:42:15,134
Montreal.
People with obsessive compulsive 

804
00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:20,600
disorder often fairly frightened if 
they'll contaminate someone else.

805
00:42:20,601 --> 00:42:21,434
So like typical obsessive compulsive 
obsession would be all go to a shopping 

806
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:27,350
market.
I'll touch some fruit from,

807
00:42:27,351 --> 00:42:28,820
you know,
some third world country.

808
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,833
I'll get some nasty bacterial disease.
I'll bring it home and I'll give it to 

809
00:42:32,121 --> 00:42:34,610
my kids while you tell them,
look,

810
00:42:34,611 --> 00:42:39,230
you know the chances of that are like 
one in 150,000 when they look at you and

811
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,064
they think,
I don't care if the chances are only 

812
00:42:42,381 --> 00:42:46,640
150,000 what if my kids die?
And you think,

813
00:42:46,641 --> 00:42:47,091
well,
yeah,

814
00:42:47,091 --> 00:42:48,710
that does pose a problem,
doesn't it?

815
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:49,544
Because it isn't exactly clear from a 
logical perspective where you should 

816
00:42:52,551 --> 00:42:53,930
draw the risk line.

817
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,690
Well,
with the obsessive compulsive,

818
00:42:58,691 --> 00:43:00,010
you do exactly the same thing.
You say,

819
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:00,431
look,
yeah,

820
00:43:00,431 --> 00:43:01,600
your fears real.
No kidding.

821
00:43:01,601 --> 00:43:02,434
Because lurking at the bottom of their 
fear is the same fear that everybody 

822
00:43:05,261 --> 00:43:06,190
else has.
Right?

823
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:09,070
Same fear.
I might die,

824
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,800
I might get sick,
I might lose the people that I love.

825
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:14,620
Not only might that happen,
it's going to happen.

826
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,320
Why aren't people afraid of that all the
time?

827
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,390
We don't really know.
Obsessive person becomes aware of it.

828
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,640
What do you tell them?
You say do it anyway,

829
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,193
do it anyways.
And they learned quickly that if they 

830
00:43:28,301 --> 00:43:30,520
don't run away from the thing they 
afraid of,

831
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,800
there's something in them that responds 
to it.

832
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:38,100
They learned that the fear is not larger
than they are now.

833
00:43:38,171 --> 00:43:40,480
I like getting the phone,
his case in particular,

834
00:43:40,481 --> 00:43:42,190
because you've always might wonder with 
this,

835
00:43:42,191 --> 00:43:43,060
like what's the limit?

836
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:43,601
Right?
Okay.

837
00:43:43,601 --> 00:43:44,800
Yeah.
That sounds good in theory,

838
00:43:44,801 --> 00:43:46,970
but what if something really terrible 
happened to you?

839
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:47,861
Well,
what's happened,

840
00:43:47,861 --> 00:43:48,694
dad?
The forest patient starts up there with 

841
00:43:49,991 --> 00:43:50,824
terrible,
right?

842
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,150
I mean,
that's up there with terrible,

843
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:57,850
right stripped of social dignity,
violated physically that combines two of

844
00:43:58,421 --> 00:44:01,420
people's most specific fears.
Well,

845
00:44:01,421 --> 00:44:04,390
then there's other kinds of 
confrontation to it.

846
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,313
I liked the story of Solzhenitsyn.
I think it's really a good one because 

847
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:08,620
there's different kinds of dragons,
right?

848
00:44:08,621 --> 00:44:11,950
There's natural dragons like death and 
disease,

849
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:15,340
and then there's social dragons like 
bureaucracies and tyrannies.

850
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,290
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,
you may or may not know as a prisoner in

851
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:23,710
the salt Soviet ghoulag concentration 
camp system,

852
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:24,813
that by his report at least killed 60 
million people between 1919 to 1959 

853
00:44:28,721 --> 00:44:29,740
right?
60 million.

854
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:31,800
That's 10 times as many as Hitler 
killed,

855
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:36,460
at least with regards to the genocide.
60 million people soldier knits,

856
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,830
and he had a pretty nasty life.

857
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:38,461
I mean,
first of all,

858
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:41,460
he's on the Russian front,
which was a nasty place to be.

859
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:44,940
Then he was captured by the Germans,
so they didn't like Russians.

860
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,030
So they put them in separate prisoners 
of war camp,

861
00:44:48,031 --> 00:44:48,864
partly because Stella and who was the 
consummate paranoid wouldn't sign the 

862
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,180
Geneva Convention on the treatment of 
prisoners of war.

863
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:58,380
So the German set up extra pow camps for
the Russians,

864
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,490
and they starve generally so badly that 
if other POW is we're in the vicinity,

865
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,324
they throw food packages over the wire,
even though they themselves weren't 

866
00:45:06,451 --> 00:45:09,300
particularly well fed.
So then,

867
00:45:09,301 --> 00:45:10,134
so the war ends and the Russians,
we ended solution gets up and goes back 

868
00:45:11,941 --> 00:45:12,661
to Russia.
Right.

869
00:45:12,661 --> 00:45:13,710
And what happens?
He's thinking,

870
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,311
you know,
wow,

871
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:15,144
this is over.
We help defend the father land we're 

872
00:45:17,971 --> 00:45:19,650
going to get,
if not a hero's welcome,

873
00:45:19,651 --> 00:45:21,630
at least some welcome.
But stellan figured,

874
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:22,464
no,
no.

875
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,640
These Russians had been to the west.
They were contaminated by their exposure

876
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:29,730
to the Western economic system.
And as a consequence of that,

877
00:45:29,731 --> 00:45:31,830
they posed a threat to the integrity,
the Soviet state.

878
00:45:31,831 --> 00:45:33,810
So he just threw them all in 
concentration camps.

879
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:35,453
So fine.
So Solzhenitsyn sitting there in this 

880
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:41,160
concentration camp on a coal pile,
a coal pile,

881
00:45:41,161 --> 00:45:41,994
which contain this kind of clay that his
compatriots would eat because they were 

882
00:45:44,761 --> 00:45:47,370
so damn hungry that it was better to 
have the clay in their stomach,

883
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:48,840
that nothing at all.
And he thought,

884
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:53,130
all right,
what the hell did I do to get here?

885
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,890
Which is really a remarkable thing to 
think,

886
00:45:55,891 --> 00:45:56,724
right?
Because like there was the second world 

887
00:45:57,721 --> 00:46:01,320
war and that probably couldn't been 
pinned directly on him.

888
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:03,480
And then there's Stellan who was,
you know,

889
00:46:03,481 --> 00:46:05,490
really one of the world's worst 
monsters.

890
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:09,300
And then there's the concentration camp 
and the POW camp.

891
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,900
And like a lot of things happened to 
soldier Knutsen,

892
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:15,680
but he said he had nothing but time to 
think in this concentration camp.

893
00:46:15,681 --> 00:46:18,030
And he wasn't really that happy with the
way things turned out.

894
00:46:18,031 --> 00:46:21,360
So he made a vow in the camp and the vow
was this.

895
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:24,270
He said he is going to go back over his 
whole life,

896
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:25,163
whole life,
right from day one and try to remember 

897
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:31,140
every time he ever did something he 
thought was wrong.

898
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:32,551
He thought,
right,

899
00:46:32,551 --> 00:46:33,384
not someone else,
but that that gave his conscience a 

900
00:46:35,701 --> 00:46:37,740
Pang.
How'd he said?

901
00:46:37,741 --> 00:46:38,574
Well,
since I don't have anything better to 

902
00:46:39,271 --> 00:46:40,104
do,
I'm going to spend like the next 10 

903
00:46:40,591 --> 00:46:44,880
years seeing if I can undo all those 
little knots in my soul that I tied.

904
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:46,343
And the consequence of that was that he 
wrote a book called the Gulag 

905
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:48,841
Archipelago,
right?

906
00:46:48,841 --> 00:46:51,510
Three volume book,
1900 pages long.

907
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,433
He memorized it because there wasn't any
paper and pencil available for him in 

908
00:46:55,381 --> 00:46:56,214
prison.
And then it circulated in the 

909
00:46:58,381 --> 00:46:59,214
underground and the Soviet Union for 
years before it got published in the 

910
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:02,334
last published in 1975 definitely one of
the literary events that brought down 

911
00:47:07,351 --> 00:47:09,600
the Soviet Union.
So I think that's kind of interesting,

912
00:47:09,601 --> 00:47:11,190
isn't it?
To think this one guy,

913
00:47:11,191 --> 00:47:13,410
right?
He's got numbers tattooed on his arm.

914
00:47:13,411 --> 00:47:15,750
He's a skinny as a rail.
He's three quarters dead.

915
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:18,060
He's been beat to death in 15 different 
ways.

916
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:19,583
He decides under completely unreasonable
circumstances that he's going to take 

917
00:47:23,011 --> 00:47:26,070
personal responsibility for the position
that he happens to find himself in.

918
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,053
The consequence of that 25 years later 
is that Solzhenitsyn's still around but 

919
00:47:30,311 --> 00:47:31,144
the Soviet Union isn't and you think,
well that can't be the way the world 

920
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:36,370
works now Canon,
but then you think this too,

921
00:47:36,371 --> 00:47:38,470
like do we really know how the world 
works?

922
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:39,304
Right?
We've had a pretty nasty century in the 

923
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:41,921
last hundred years,
right?

924
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:44,020
We had the Nazis,
we had mt say tongue.

925
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:45,123
We had the recent tragedies in Africa.
We don't seem to learn anything about 

926
00:47:47,891 --> 00:47:50,290
genocide.
Someone like Solzhenitsyn says,

927
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:51,124
wow,
you know,

928
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:54,940
might be your fault.
Why?

929
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:56,350
What are you ignoring?

930
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,170
Good question.
Can you make peace with your own family?

931
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:01,640
It's not so easy,
right?

932
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:03,103
It's probably no easier than making 
peace between the Israelis and the 

933
00:48:04,821 --> 00:48:05,654
Palestinians.
What are we encounter when we 

934
00:48:11,281 --> 00:48:12,930
encountered something we don't 
understand?

935
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,540
We don't know.
It's not the simple world of objects.

936
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:21,420
The simple world of objects is something
we've learned to see.

937
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:25,950
The real world is way more complicated 
than what we just see.

938
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:27,390
Let me give you an example.

939
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,640
When I was in Montreal in 1985 my 
computer crashed.

940
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:37,790
So what do you do when your computer 
crashes?

941
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:38,624
While we're not,
we're not computer encounter something 

942
00:48:39,951 --> 00:48:41,240
unexpected.
It crashes.

943
00:48:41,241 --> 00:48:43,130
It can't do a damn thing about it.
You have to fix it.

944
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:45,890
So I checked the monitoring.
It was okay.

945
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,230
I wouldn't go on.
It seemed all right.

946
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:52,040
Then I noticed my labs weren't working,
so I went to the fuse box.

947
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:56,060
So all the fuses seemed okay.
So then I went outside to go down to the

948
00:48:56,061 --> 00:48:59,000
corner store to get a cigarette and I 
saw that outside.

949
00:48:59,001 --> 00:49:01,010
All the lights were off,
the traffic lights were off,

950
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,290
right?
The whole city was in darkness.

951
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:07,040
Then I found out the next day that there
was a solar wind,

952
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:09,253
big solar flare,
put out a big cloud of electrons zipped 

953
00:49:12,471 --> 00:49:13,304
along to Earth at the speed of light,
put an electrical pulse through the 

954
00:49:16,341 --> 00:49:17,240
Hydro Electric Grid.

955
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,810
And Quebec crashed my computer.
Well,

956
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:22,183
I hadn't thought until that point that 
the integrity of my computer was 

957
00:49:26,121 --> 00:49:26,954
dependent on the stability of the sun.
Everything is way more complicated than 

958
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,980
it looks,
and when you just look at something,

959
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,800
you see a very simple representation of 
what's actually there.

960
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:40,520
What do you encounter when you encounter
something unexpected?

961
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,950
Well,
when you first encounter it,

962
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:47,780
you don't know.
All you know is that frightens you,

963
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:51,830
but it makes you curious.
Think dragons,

964
00:49:51,831 --> 00:49:54,410
right?
Every primates afraid of lizards,

965
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:57,380
including us.
Chimpanzees don't like snakes.

966
00:49:57,381 --> 00:49:58,880
If you take a champ,
it's never seen a snake.

967
00:49:58,881 --> 00:50:02,240
You throw it us to show it a snake,
it will hit the roof of its cage.

968
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:07,460
Then it'll look at the snake.
Why would a drag and hoard gold?

969
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,150
Because a dragon represents everything 
that you're afraid of.

970
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,360
What's embedded in everything that 
you're afraid of.

971
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:21,060
Absolutely everything that you need to 
find run from what you're afraid of,

972
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,793
run from exactly what you need to find.
One of the oldest dramatic 

973
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:39,470
representations we know of,
not this specific painting.

974
00:50:39,471 --> 00:50:43,730
This is Saint George and the dragon 
dragon lives in the ground

975
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,253
chase,
thereby heroes of a previous generation 

976
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:54,280
now and then re-emerging kills people,
right?

977
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:55,810
These are skulls around it's

978
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:57,503
layer.

979
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,070
It threatens the integrity of the 
community.

980
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:06,260
Like everything unexpected does.
Hero comes out,

981
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:12,760
slays the dragon,
freeze the treasure.

982
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:14,890
This case it's a virgin,
a woman

983
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:25,613
dragon's hoard gold because the thing 
you most need is always to be found 

984
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:31,483
where you least want to look.
I'm going to close this with another 

985
00:51:35,851 --> 00:51:36,684
dream.
This is dream my five year old nephew 

986
00:51:41,161 --> 00:51:41,994
had,
now he got to get the context of this 

987
00:51:44,461 --> 00:51:46,410
stream right here.
After this dream,

988
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:51,530
parents were divorced
so there were dragons in the house.

989
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,583
He was about four at this time is 
running around the house with this 

990
00:51:57,361 --> 00:52:00,420
little plastic night helmet on and its 
sword is zipping around,

991
00:52:00,421 --> 00:52:03,330
killing things with it,
doing this all at the time and even when

992
00:52:03,331 --> 00:52:04,650
he went to sleep at night,
he'd put this,

993
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:08,550
the a sword by his pillow and the night 
helmet on his pillow.

994
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:09,543
Now,
every night or every second night or 

995
00:52:10,981 --> 00:52:13,650
every third night for six months,
he'd been waking up screaming.

996
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:14,603
Now why?
While he was about to go to 

997
00:52:15,691 --> 00:52:16,381
kindergarten,
right?

998
00:52:16,381 --> 00:52:18,340
So that's,
that's a real threshold for kid,

999
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:21,210
way from maternal dependence 
fundamentally into the real world.

1000
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,610
That's,
that's a new thing.

1001
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:29,360
But also there was upset in his house.
So I was there one night when he woke up

1002
00:52:29,671 --> 00:52:30,960
screaming next morning,
I said,

1003
00:52:30,961 --> 00:52:32,280
well,
did you dream anything?

1004
00:52:32,281 --> 00:52:34,500
And so he launched into this story,
he said,

1005
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:37,503
dwarf.
He was in this field and these little 

1006
00:52:40,121 --> 00:52:44,050
creatures like dwarves were coming up to
him and they didn't have any arms.

1007
00:52:44,051 --> 00:52:47,230
They just had legs and they were bad,
big beaks.

1008
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:48,123
And they were covered with hair and 
Greece and on top of their head was 

1009
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:51,334
across,
shaved into this hair and there's lots 

1010
00:52:54,131 --> 00:52:54,964
and lots of these doors.
And they were jumping on him with their 

1011
00:52:56,801 --> 00:52:57,750
beaks,
biting him.

1012
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,250
And we all looked at him thought,
well,

1013
00:53:00,251 --> 00:53:01,660
it's no wonder you're waking up 
screaming,

1014
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:02,231
right?
I mean,

1015
00:53:02,231 --> 00:53:03,640
you know,
that doesn't sound so good.

1016
00:53:03,641 --> 00:53:04,301
And then he said,
well,

1017
00:53:04,301 --> 00:53:07,210
wait,
there's more right back in the distance.

1018
00:53:07,211 --> 00:53:08,044
There's a dragon and the dragon is 
puffing out fire and smoke and every 

1019
00:53:12,611 --> 00:53:15,670
time he pops out foreign smoke,
it turns into these dwarfs.

1020
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,350
Big problem,
right?

1021
00:53:17,351 --> 00:53:19,720
Just like the problem with the Hydra in 
Greek mythology,

1022
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:23,320
cut off one head,
seven more appear.

1023
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:24,243
Right?
So are you going to do about these kill 

1024
00:53:26,011 --> 00:53:28,410
one big deal,
10 more common.

1025
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:30,443
I said,
what can you do about that now in 

1026
00:53:33,691 --> 00:53:34,524
illegal trial,
that would have been an inadmissible 

1027
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:36,714
question,
right?

1028
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:37,823
That's called leading the witness 
because what I told him was despite the 

1029
00:53:41,281 --> 00:53:42,114
horror of this situation,
you maybe could do something about it 

1030
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:46,950
and he said,
hi,

1031
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,080
I'd take my sword.
I get my dad.

1032
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:50,190
That's a good idea,
right?

1033
00:53:50,191 --> 00:53:52,800
Dad,
here's the real dad and then there's the

1034
00:53:52,801 --> 00:53:54,060
tradition dad,
right?

1035
00:53:54,061 --> 00:53:54,894
You might as well have your father by 
your side if you're going to go into 

1036
00:53:56,221 --> 00:53:57,690
battle.
I'd take my sword,

1037
00:53:57,691 --> 00:54:00,300
I get my dad,
I go to where the dragon was.

1038
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,033
I jumped up on his head.
I put both of his eyes out with this 

1039
00:54:03,661 --> 00:54:06,880
sword.
I'd go down his throat to the place with

1040
00:54:06,881 --> 00:54:07,714
the fire comes out.

1041
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:11,580
I can cut a piece of that box out and 
I'd use it as a shield and I thought,

1042
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:13,770
wow,
that's unbelievable.

1043
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:15,810
Unbelievable that he could do that.
It's perfect,

1044
00:54:15,811 --> 00:54:17,490
right?
There's no sense going after the dwarves

1045
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:21,450
because thousands of them,
you might as well go after the dragon.

1046
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:25,350
What happens if you go after the Dragon?
You get a piece of it,

1047
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,020
right?
A piece of its center nature,

1048
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:32,730
a piece that can defend you against 
anything including other dragons.

1049
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:33,773
So what if this was the case you think 
evolutionarily speaking or religiously 

1050
00:54:39,121 --> 00:54:41,760
speaking,
what if we were adapted to the world?

1051
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:46,080
And what if it's not the simple place of
dead objects that we think it is?

1052
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:49,890
What if it's something a lot more alive?
Lot more like a story?

1053
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:52,950
What if the story is something like 
this?

1054
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:59,300
You have absolutely everything you need,
but you have to use all of it.

1055
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,673
If you run away from any of it,
and in particular the parts of it that 

1056
00:55:04,411 --> 00:55:05,244
frighten you,
which you know there's endless reasons 

1057
00:55:06,811 --> 00:55:09,330
to run away from.
If you run away from any of it,

1058
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:14,070
you don't get that piece of the Dragon.
If you miss even one piece,

1059
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:17,490
there's a chink in your armor.
There's a place where you're vulnerable.

1060
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:20,520
If you make even one mistake,
you lessen yourself.

1061
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,610
If you less than yourself,
you're going to run away more.

1062
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,860
Not only that,
when someone wants to lean on you,

1063
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,340
they're not going to be able to lean on 
you because you'll just fall over.

1064
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:30,953
What if it was the case that we were 
adapted to the world really adapted to 

1065
00:55:34,111 --> 00:55:37,980
it so that if we made full use of all 
the talents we had,

1066
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:39,263
we'd be okay.
What if it was the case that if we set 

1067
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:46,590
out consciously to never run away from 
something,

1068
00:55:46,591 --> 00:55:50,040
we know we shouldn't run away from that?
Everything would be all right.

1069
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:52,063
Well,

1070
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:55,110
you can think whatever you want to 
think,

1071
00:55:55,111 --> 00:55:55,944
but this is what I think.
I think it's bloody amazing that that 

1072
00:55:58,921 --> 00:55:59,754
Little Kid's book that I read you at the
beginning of this lecture had all that 

1073
00:56:03,301 --> 00:56:04,134
information in it,
and so you might ask yourself when you 

1074
00:56:06,391 --> 00:56:10,050
leave,
if that information isn't true,

1075
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:15,690
how the hell did it get there?
That's it.

1076
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:23,960
Thanks.
