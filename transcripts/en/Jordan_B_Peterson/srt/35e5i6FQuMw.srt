1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,810
So we're going to talk about
conscientiousness again today.

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,123
MMM.

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,450
Its division into industrious in
orderliness is relatively new.

4
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:22,190
Those separable elements of
conscientiousness of only or you're

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,130
going are,
I've only been established since 2007 I

6
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:32,131
talked to you a couple of weeks ago
about the relationship between the

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,840
relationship that I was hypothesizing
between disgust,

8
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,250
disgust,
sensitivity,

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,280
contamination and dominance,
hierarchy status,

10
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:44,140
right?
And I was trying to tie that into

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:45,763
mmm.

12
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,220
The degree to which someone's belief
systems would assure their status and

13
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:56,910
safety in the world.
And I want to continue with that

14
00:00:56,911 --> 00:01:00,210
discussion today
and narrow it,

15
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,620
narrow it to some degree as,
as well as broadening it and others.

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,313
Okay.

17
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,780
So conscientiousness is a sub element of
the meditates stability and the

18
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:20,541
correlation between industriousness and
orderliness is relatively low.

19
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,560
Given that there are two elements of the
same trait.

20
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,970
So for openness and intelligence,
you see that there's a correlation of

21
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,030
0.35 that's the lowest plasticity,
plasticity aspect,

22
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:42,150
inter correlation.
And then for conscientiousness it's r

23
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:44,910
equals 0.39 for industriousness and
orderliness.

24
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,190
Now here's the basic items for
orderliness and industriousness.

25
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,150
So for orderliness,
its leaves belongings around,

26
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,990
obviously that's negatively scored.
Likes order,

27
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:02,210
keeps things tidy,
follows a schedule,

28
00:02:02,211 --> 00:02:06,590
is not bothered by messy people,
wants everything to be just right is not

29
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:07,970
bothered by disorder,
dislikes.

30
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:11,480
Routine seals sees that rules are
observed,

31
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:16,481
wants every detail taken care of and for
industriousness carries out his or her

32
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,250
plans,
wastes time negatively scored,

33
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,740
finds it difficult to get down to work
again,

34
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:22,940
negatively scored,
messes,

35
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:25,240
things up,
finishes what he,

36
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,560
she starts,
doesn't put his or her mind on the task

37
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:29,150
at hand,
gets things done quickly,

38
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:32,870
always knows what he or she is doing.
Postpones decisions and is easily

39
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:36,140
distracted.
There's a decisiveness that seems to go

40
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:39,350
along with industriousness and
efficiency.

41
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:45,350
With orderliness,
there seems to be something that's

42
00:02:45,351 --> 00:02:49,100
associated with the desire for
categorical stability.

43
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,880
Now I have a sneaking suspicion that our
propensity to categorize the human

44
00:02:55,071 --> 00:03:00,071
propensity to categorize is more tightly
associated with disgust sensitivity than

45
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:03,220
we might think.
And the reason I believe that is because

46
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,910
we're omnivores and that means that we
have to make a lot of very complicated

47
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:08,050
decisions about food.

48
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,093
Now

49
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,780
here's part of the problem with
conscientiousness.

50
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,310
There's no theoretical model,
there's no neuropsychological model.

51
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,740
So we don't know how to integrate
conscientiousness into,

52
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,660
into neuroscience in general.
There's no psychological model except

53
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:30,080
that we know you can measure it with
self report and there's no

54
00:03:30,081 --> 00:03:32,630
pharmacological model.
So we have no idea.

55
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:34,070
For example,
with anxiety.

56
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,250
So neuroticism,
Serotonin,

57
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,780
Serotonin reuptake inhibitors and
Benzodiazepines,

58
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,340
barbiturates,
an alcohol all work to decrease negative

59
00:03:43,341 --> 00:03:47,210
emotion and dopamine agonists work to
increase positive emotion.

60
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,470
And oxytocin works for agreeableness.
It heightens agreeableness.

61
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,500
Um,
and you can even do pharmacological

62
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,170
manipulations to change openness.
So for example,

63
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,440
one of the most recent studies done on
siliciden mushrooms,

64
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:04,100
it was the first study done on
psychedelics for,

65
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,650
for probably 40 years,
showed that,

66
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:08,630
okay,

67
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,930
one dose of Psilocybin mushrooms
produced a one standard deviation

68
00:04:11,931 --> 00:04:16,190
increase in openness one year later,
which is staggering.

69
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,190
It's a huge change and it seems
permanent.

70
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,580
So,
so you see,

71
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,820
even though the big five was developed
statistically,

72
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:31,310
that the details are being filled in
constantly from a structural and a

73
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,570
pharmacological perspective.
But conscientiousness is a tough one.

74
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,400
And it's also partly because our animal
models of conscientiousness are not well

75
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:42,980
developed.
You know,

76
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:46,430
you could make a case in some sense that
human beings are the only creatures that

77
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:51,431
work in that we'll forego pleasures in
the moment for increased security and

78
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:58,490
opportunity in the future.
And so that and since conscientiousness

79
00:04:58,491 --> 00:05:02,120
seems to be integrity tied up with that,
it also seems to indicate that it's a

80
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,000
like a fairly high order,
emotional,

81
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:07,160
motivational cognitive attribute.

82
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,960
Here's a problem.

83
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:19,030
The classic neuropsychological
story I suppose is that the dorsal

84
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,160
lateral prefrontal Cortex,
which is the part of the cortex that's

85
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,180
expanded particularly rapidly among
human beings,

86
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,990
is associated with planning and abstract
thinking.

87
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:34,700
And there seems to be very little doubt
about that.

88
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,640
However,
the correlation between Dorsolateral

89
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:40,460
prefrontal function,
which is basically the cognitive

90
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:43,100
functions are very much akin to fluid
intelligence.

91
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,090
The correlation between Dorsolateral
prefrontal function and

92
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:50,870
conscientiousness is basically zero.
So,

93
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,030
and I believe the reason for that is
that

94
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,070
the ability to abstract task,
that that conscientiousness has

95
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:01,910
something to do with implementation of
abstraction into behavior.

96
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:07,430
Whereas abstraction requires that you
remove the obstruction from the behavior

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and
run simulations on the abstraction in in

98
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,490
an imagine it in a space of imagination.
So that you can investigate the

99
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:22,850
consequences of different courses of
action in the absence of acting them

100
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:27,080
out.
It's quite interesting that despite the

101
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:30,080
fact that it's a neuropsychological
truism,

102
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:33,470
that the prefrontal cortex is involved
in the inhibition of behavior and the

103
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,970
control of behavior from a statistical
point of view or psychometric point of

104
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:39,650
view.
That doesn't seem to be the case at all.

105
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,320
I think actually what happens is that
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex can

106
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:50,321
help you organize nicely arranged
hierarchical goal structures and that

107
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:54,890
those can regulate your behavior,
but that doesn't mean that there's any

108
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:59,180
direct relationship between
cognitive function and behavioral

109
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:04,181
regulation.
Conscientiousness is being defined by

110
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:09,650
Roberts as the tendency to be planful
organized task and goal oriented and

111
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:12,470
self controlled it to delay
gratification and follow norms and

112
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:15,890
rules.
It sounds like a cognitive attribute.

113
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:20,240
You know so much of that planful,
organized,

114
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,180
goal-oriented,
all sounds like higher cognitive

115
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:24,014
function,
but

116
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,020
it doesn't seem to be.
It seems to be,

117
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,840
it seems to be associated with something
else.

118
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,260
That's a big mystery.
Now here's some consequences of

119
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:36,800
conscientiousness.

120
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,970
It's strongly related to life
satisfaction and happiness.

121
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,500
There's a number of studies that show
that and the reason seems to be I

122
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:52,501
suspect is that if you're a
conscientious person and so you run your

123
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:57,700
conscientious life across time,
you build a rather orderly and

124
00:07:57,701 --> 00:08:02,701
predictable and stable environment
around you in multiple ways and one of

125
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:05,710
the ways to not be anxious is

126
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:12,150
to be low in trait neuroticism,
but another way to not be anxious is not

127
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:17,151
to have anything to be anxious about and
you know perfectly well from your own

128
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:21,660
experience that if you adopt an
unconscientious attitude to a task that

129
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:24,000
you've sent,
that you've set for yourself,

130
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:27,270
the probability that you're going to
experience negative emotion as a

131
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:32,130
consequence of that is very high.
It might be as the deadline approaches

132
00:08:32,131 --> 00:08:37,131
and you haven't done what you had
contracted with yourself to do or maybe

133
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:39,810
if you're particularly resistant to
negative emotion,

134
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:43,890
maybe the negative emotion only kicks in
afterwards when as a consequence of

135
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,380
failing to do what you said you were
going to do,

136
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,640
you fail at the task,
but either way the consequences come

137
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:51,474
rolling in.

138
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,200
An interesting study by Faye Yard in
2012 showed that conscientiousness was

139
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:07,230
associated with specific emotions and
overall negative emotion,

140
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:09,900
but was most strongly associated with
guilt.

141
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,680
So within this situation,
guilt actually turns out to be a good

142
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:17,580
thing.
Conscientiousness was negatively related

143
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:21,270
to guilt experience,
but positively related to guilt

144
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:24,120
proneness.
So that's kind of interesting because

145
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:29,121
what it suggests is that if you are,
if you use your guilt to guide you such

146
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:33,750
that you stopped doing things that make
you guilty,

147
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,740
you're less likely to feel guilt as a
consequence of doing something wrong

148
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,050
because you're won't be doing something
wrong.

149
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,540
So,
so conscientious miss seems to be

150
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,090
hovering around the guilt,
shame,

151
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,450
disgust,
nexis in some way that we haven't really

152
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:52,350
sorted out yet

153
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:01,370
since dividing conscientiousness up
until orderliness and industriousness,

154
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,910
we've started to understand somewhat
more clearly the temperamental basis of

155
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:13,761
political preference.
Conservatives tend to be ordered like,

156
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,550
and low and openness.
Now orderly people,

157
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,310
well they make good roommates unless
they're,

158
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,960
you know,
they've got to the point where they're

159
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,090
completely obsessive,
you know,

160
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,040
cause everything trails off into
catastrophe.

161
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:30,000
If you push any trait too far,
there's a cliff over which you'll fall

162
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,610
orderly.
People seem to be good at process

163
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:33,690
management.
You know,

164
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:35,670
they make sure that everything is
sequenced properly,

165
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:38,370
that it runs properly.
And you can understand that in many

166
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,700
situations that's going to be an
incredibly useful trade.

167
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:46,701
It's useful in scientific endeavor
because if you're doing data with

168
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:47,910
spreadsheets,
full of numbers,

169
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:51,210
if you transpose one row,
you're done right?

170
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:53,880
That's the end of the study.
You can't make one mistake in a

171
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:55,650
spreadsheet.
It has to be perfect,

172
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,860
especially when you can make
catastrophic mistakes with computers,

173
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,240
right?
Because they're very,

174
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,080
very good at making major mistakes.
So you have to be very orderly to be a

175
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,440
scientist.
Um,

176
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,390
industriousness seems to be a better
predictor of

177
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:17,130
phenomena like grade point average,
but orderliness still has its place in

178
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,670
assuring that complex procedures are
carried out properly.

179
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,770
Orderly.
People also seem to be more discussed

180
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:29,110
and sensitive.
They have a preference for order and

181
00:11:29,111 --> 00:11:31,000
tradition,
and they're not particularly

182
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:33,160
egalitarian.
So they're,

183
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:37,090
they're hierarchical.
And maybe that's because hierarchies are

184
00:11:37,091 --> 00:11:38,410
more efficient.
I mean,

185
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,550
the problem with egalitarian
organizations is that

186
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,130
they can't organize themselves along any
access.

187
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,290
So you saw that,
for example,

188
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:53,530
with the,
what do they call those people in York,

189
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:58,531
in central park after the 2008 crash.
What was it occupy?

190
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:04,810
Yeah.
I mean it was a chaotic demonstration

191
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:07,120
and no doubt there was something to
demonstrate against,

192
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:12,121
but the egalitarian left wingers who
were running the organization couldn't

193
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:14,260
figure out what they wanted or what to
say.

194
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,370
So that's a problem from a political
perspective to some degree,

195
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:21,520
because it means the right wing is going
to have an advantage over the left wing

196
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,730
on almost a permanent basis because
they're going to be better at

197
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:28,300
organizing.
Now they left wing is more open,

198
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:31,180
so they're going to be more creative.
So hopefully that's enough of an edge to

199
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:34,630
keep the two sides properly balanced.
Orderly.

200
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:38,140
People also make harsh judgments of
moral transgression.

201
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,290
I think that probably goes along with
the hierarchy,

202
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,390
you know?
So I think for orderly people,

203
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:47,500
there's a pretty steep hierarchy of,
of good versus bad or,

204
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,480
or maybe good versus evil.
And that each of the tiers in that

205
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:55,870
hierarchy or clearly demarcated and
their demarcated morally,

206
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,730
it's better to be at the top.

207
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,103
Yeah,

208
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,330
and it's worse to be at the bottom dock
near Calc,

209
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,090
calc Keltner,
I think,

210
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,230
sorry,
I can't pronounce his name properly.

211
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:12,231
At the moment has andy and Jonathan
Haidt if talked about the moralization

212
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:16,080
of purity and they believe that

213
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,720
one of the things that distinguishes
the top of an orderly hierarchy from the

214
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:28,920
bottom of an orderly hierarchy is that
the people at the top who are following

215
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:33,150
the rules fall into the metaphorical
category of pure

216
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,620
and the people at the bottom who aren't
following the rules fall into the

217
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:42,621
metaphorical category of the impure.
And you can also see to some degree if

218
00:13:43,771 --> 00:13:47,220
you use your imagination a bit how
that's mapped onto dietary preferences,

219
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:52,221
especially in religious systems because
there are pure foods and pure ways of

220
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:56,790
preparing food is an impure foods and
impure ways of preparing foods.

221
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:02,010
And you also see the same thing emerge
in modern political western political

222
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:07,011
discourse where people spontaneously
organize themselves into groups of

223
00:14:07,021 --> 00:14:10,710
different self proclaimed morality based
on what they choose to eat.

224
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,490
It looks like it's something very deeply
rooted inside people.

225
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,300
I think it's probably also potentially
also associated with the fact that at

226
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:25,110
least since we've had agriculture and
reasonably large settlements,

227
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,010
okay,

228
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,030
we had to be pretty orderly with regards
to our agricultural store houses because

229
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,610
if you're not orderly when you store
food,

230
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:38,590
then rats and insects eat all of it or
it gets moldy if it's damp and then it

231
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,860
gets rotten and then you can't eat it
and then you starve to death.

232
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,820
So it's,
it's not a good outcome.

233
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:48,750
So I think there's a number of factors
that have congregated together to align

234
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:54,001
that disgust sensitivity system and the
orderliness system and the system of

235
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:59,351
harsh judgment and the ideas of purity
and impurity to bring them all into one

236
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:00,800
form of alignment.

237
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,600
We wrote a paper a while back,
which hasn't been published yet.

238
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,930
Jacob Hersch,
who's the first author on this paper

239
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,800
entitled it conservatism as a social
immune system.

240
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:18,560
And I'm going to read you a little bit
of the intro from this paper.

241
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,690
Disgust is considered to be one of the
basic human emotions defined by a strong

242
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:27,500
revulsion and desire to withdraw from an
eliciting stimulus or event.

243
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,860
It's a very embodied emotion.
So it's anxiety,

244
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:36,950
makes an excitement,
makes your heart race well,

245
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:39,650
that's one thing,
but disgust makes your stomach churn,

246
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,430
you know,
and it's associated with vomiting and,

247
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,100
and uh,
and uh,

248
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,600
and tremendous aversion.
It's also very,

249
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:51,350
very unpleasant emotion.
It might be the most unpleasant emotion.

250
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,570
It's hard for modern people to judge
that because our societies are so well

251
00:15:56,571 --> 00:16:00,050
organized that we almost never come into
contact with anything that's disgusting.

252
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,670
It's all put away.

253
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,310
So,
and you can understand why,

254
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:09,311
because many things that are disgusting
are actually contaminated and produce

255
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,870
pathology,
their illness generators.

256
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,520
So it's not an arbitrary judgment.
Physically disgust is accompanied by a

257
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:20,180
distinct facial expression involving
constriction of the oral and nasal

258
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:23,090
cavities.
Remember when we watched the crumb

259
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:25,730
video,
one of the things that the chrome

260
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:29,580
brothers typically got from women that
they were trying to approach was a

261
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:33,980
disgust facial expression,
and that seems to be associated with the

262
00:16:33,981 --> 00:16:37,970
idea of lowly status and contamination
and the desire to,

263
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,480
to close yourself off from the offending
source.

264
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,860
Evolutionary models of disgust proposed
at this emotion evolved to help us avoid

265
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:50,060
contaminated or harmful foods or other
potential sources of disease such as

266
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:53,050
sexual contact.
No.

267
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:57,230
You know,
we know that if you arrange creatures in

268
00:16:57,231 --> 00:17:01,820
a dominance hierarchy and then you run a
pat a pathogen through the population

269
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:05,960
and infectious disease,
then the population tends to die from

270
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:09,350
the bottom up,
which means that the animals or people

271
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,260
at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy
who are chronically more stressed are

272
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:15,830
much more likely to be carriers of
infectious agents and much more likely

273
00:17:15,831 --> 00:17:16,670
to die from that.

274
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,220
Now,
I don't know what the stats are for

275
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:21,290
sexually transmitted diseases.
Oh,

276
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,430
I should've looked that up,
but I would suspect that the same thing

277
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:28,460
probably applies there.
That as you construct it,

278
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:32,630
socioeconomic hierarchy,
the probability of trends of acquiring

279
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,830
sexually transmitted disease decreases
as you move up the hierarchy

280
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:43,650
in addition to its role in directly
helping to expel harmful foods from the

281
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:47,350
body.
Disgust also forms an important

282
00:17:47,351 --> 00:17:51,570
component of the behavior.
Let me UN the suite of psychological

283
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,770
mechanisms that aid in the detection and
avoidance of potential contaminants

284
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,140
before they can make contact with the
body.

285
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,240
Okay.

286
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,240
The other thing that we should never
forget is that the reason we can all say

287
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:06,540
it here,
so clean and well put together,

288
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:12,530
it's fundamentally because the plumber's
produced to transformation and western

289
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:16,590
North American and Western society a
hundred years ago,

290
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,810
and by getting rid of all of the
contaminants that were associated with

291
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:25,020
poor plumbing,
we cranked our life expectancy up

292
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:30,021
tremendously.
So it's another example of the actual

293
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:33,840
relationship between sensitivity to
discussed and longevity.

294
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:38,820
We also know that conscientious people
have better standards of hygiene than

295
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:41,160
unconscientious people and they do live
longer.

296
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,970
Discussed may have its origins in the
protection against physical

297
00:18:45,971 --> 00:18:48,010
contamination.
A number of studies have implicated

298
00:18:48,011 --> 00:18:50,120
disgust responses in moral decision
making,

299
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,460
inducing disgust responses,
whether via a follow order,

300
00:18:53,461 --> 00:18:57,430
at disgusting work environment or
recalling a disgusting experience led

301
00:18:57,431 --> 00:19:01,450
individuals to assign harsher
punishments to others who had committed

302
00:19:01,451 --> 00:19:05,950
moral transgressions.
Harsher moral judgments could even be

303
00:19:05,951 --> 00:19:07,810
induced,
falling the consumption of a bitter

304
00:19:07,811 --> 00:19:11,710
drink.
Bitter taste tends to evoke a disgust

305
00:19:11,711 --> 00:19:16,711
response not because all bitter tastes
are poisonous but because most poisonous

306
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:22,300
tastes are bitter.
In addition,

307
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:25,600
the same disgust related facial
expressions or observed in response to

308
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:28,750
unpleasant tastes,
disgusting photographs and receiving

309
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,910
unfair treatment in an economic game.

310
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,880
Concerns about cleanliness and feelings
of disgust have likewise being related

311
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:41,880
to political attitudes.
Situational reminders of the importance

312
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:45,540
of physical cleanliness such as asking
participants to wipe their hands with

313
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:50,541
antiseptic wipes tends to increase self
reported political conservatism such a

314
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:55,980
finding is consistent with the notion
that purity tends to be valued more by

315
00:19:55,981 --> 00:20:00,981
conservatives than by liberals.
Individuals who report being disgusted

316
00:20:01,531 --> 00:20:05,250
more easily also tend to hold more
conservative political views on topics

317
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:06,750
including abortion,
gay marriage,

318
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:08,430
tax cuts and affirmative action.

319
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,510
In addition to the effects that have
emerged when using self reported disgust

320
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:15,580
sensitivity,
more conservative political views have

321
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:19,060
also been associated with stronger
physiological reactivity to disgusting

322
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:21,670
images.
In particular,

323
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:24,250
a large literature is converged on the
notion that there are two core

324
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:28,690
dimensions of conservatism,
resistance to change and tolerance of

325
00:20:28,691 --> 00:20:32,860
inequality.
Resistance to change reflects the extent

326
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:35,260
to which people wish to maintain the
status quo.

327
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,530
While tolerance of inequality reflects
the acceptance of an unequal

328
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:41,350
distribution of resources and
opportunities within the society.

329
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,880
Now,
you know,

330
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,820
we talked about this already.
It's a complicated issue because

331
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,680
if you're absolutely egalitarian nerve
in your orientation,

332
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:56,520
then you have to make the presumption
that all differences in hierarchical

333
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,440
status are fundamentally unjust,

334
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:00,920
okay?

335
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,980
If you're absolutely hierarchical in
your orientation,

336
00:21:03,981 --> 00:21:08,120
then you have to make the assumption
that the distribution of resources that

337
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,080
obtains currently is a consequence of
justice,

338
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,630
right?
The people at the top deserve to be

339
00:21:14,631 --> 00:21:16,700
there and the people at the bottom
deserve to be there.

340
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,860
Now,
as we've already discussed,

341
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:23,930
the situation is complicated by the fact
that there seems to be some truth in

342
00:21:23,931 --> 00:21:28,130
both claims and so far is
conscientiousness and intelligence

343
00:21:28,131 --> 00:21:32,510
predict longterm socioeconomic status
and that conscientiousness and

344
00:21:32,511 --> 00:21:36,200
intelligence to seem to be associated
quite strongly with competence.

345
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:41,300
Then the degree to which they predict
social status seems to indicate that the

346
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:46,301
structure is just the fact that people
are brought down the dominance hierarchy

347
00:21:46,491 --> 00:21:49,160
for all sorts of reasons that have
nothing to do with their intrinsic

348
00:21:49,161 --> 00:21:54,161
competence or or their willingness to
engage in productive activity weakens

349
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:59,000
the conservative argument because there
are certainly cases where the

350
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:03,020
distribution of resources can be seen to
be fundamentally unjust.

351
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:08,390
I think one of the things that happens
with political belief is that you can

352
00:22:08,391 --> 00:22:11,330
think about political beliefs as
heuristics and heuristics are

353
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,900
unconscious rules.
They're really algorithms that people

354
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:19,340
use to address large sets of data to
simplify them so that they're not,

355
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,360
they're not drowning in complexity.
The system is just,

356
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,950
well,
that's a simplification.

357
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,130
It means there's all sorts of things
that you don't have to think about.

358
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:33,770
This system is unjust is is it is a
heuristic oversimplification as well and

359
00:22:33,771 --> 00:22:37,160
it means that you don't have to think
your way through the complexities of the

360
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:40,850
actual topic that you're dealing with
and what seems to be happening is that

361
00:22:40,851 --> 00:22:45,851
the temperamental factors that we've
discussed so to speak reflect the use of

362
00:22:47,211 --> 00:22:50,000
heuristics that are grounded deeply in
motivation and emotion.

363
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,380
Yeah.

364
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,290
The two dimensions,
resistance to change and tolerance of

365
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,920
inequality appear roughly aligned with
social and economic conservative

366
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,010
conservatism as expressed in the
constructs of right wing

367
00:23:03,011 --> 00:23:06,550
authoritarianism and social dominance
orientation respectively.

368
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,860
The core facets of conservatism are also
closely related to the two higher order

369
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:15,490
value dimensions described in moral
foundations theory which reflect

370
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,610
preference for order and tradition on
the one hand and preferences for

371
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:20,110
egalitarianism.
On the other.

372
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,150
Importantly,
the motivational basis of these two

373
00:23:24,151 --> 00:23:27,570
dimensions appears to vary independently
from one another with an individual's

374
00:23:27,571 --> 00:23:29,340
overall political attitudes on it.
Right.

375
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:32,040
Left spectrum emerging from the relative
balance.

376
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,140
Okay.

377
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,350
These motives are also strongly rooted
in basic personality characteristics

378
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:40,980
such that preferences for order and
tradition are associated with higher

379
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:45,410
levels of orderliness,
not industriousness and politeness,

380
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:49,610
which is an aspect of agreeableness as
well as with lower levels of openness

381
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:54,380
and intellect and contrast.
Preferences for egalitarianism are

382
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:58,670
uniquely associated with compassion and
aspect of agreeableness.

383
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:06,330
Political conservatism can be thought of
as a social immune system reflecting the

384
00:24:06,331 --> 00:24:09,690
extension of pathogen avoidance
mechanisms to the integrity of the

385
00:24:09,691 --> 00:24:12,240
social system.
So the idea there,

386
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,390
the metaphorical idea,
look,

387
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:18,810
if you're egalitarianism,
everyone's a big family.

388
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,100
That's the core metaphor.
Um,

389
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,240
I think that's part of the reason that
women are more agreeable than men.

390
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,490
They're are more compassionate than men,
and it's necessary for them to be more

391
00:24:32,491 --> 00:24:37,491
compassionate than men because they have
the obligation or opportunity to concern

392
00:24:39,751 --> 00:24:42,090
themselves with the egalitarian
distributors,

393
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,670
distribution of resources within the
family unit.

394
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:50,743
If you're

395
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,860
orderly,
the fundamental metaphor,

396
00:24:57,861 --> 00:25:00,760
it doesn't seem to be family.
The fundamental,

397
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:05,820
fundamental metaphor seems to be body
and the purity of the body and so,

398
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,290
and the vulnerability of the body.
That's another element of it.

399
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:15,430
Just as the behavioral immune system is
being conceptualized as helping to

400
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,710
maintain the purity integrity of an
individual body,

401
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,910
so to may the same pathogen avoidance
system help to maintain the abstract

402
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:26,911
integrity of the social order.
We don't call our society a body of laws

403
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,120
for nothing.
We also tend to symbolize countries as

404
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:33,070
people.
So

405
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,450
you can say things like England took
steps to,

406
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:44,140
or France recently decided to,
and so there's the idea that each state

407
00:25:45,381 --> 00:25:49,400
can be represented as a body.
You could also say that a hereditary

408
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:54,401
monarch like Queen Elizabeth,
it's such a powerful figure because she

409
00:25:55,521 --> 00:26:00,320
embodies in her actual being,
the concept of the state.

410
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,740
The state is a body.
It's actually a body of laws,

411
00:26:06,741 --> 00:26:10,220
and in so far as you are bound by that
body of laws,

412
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:15,460
you're all acting out the same body
because you're mimicking the same set of

413
00:26:15,891 --> 00:26:19,220
principles that describe the way that
you orient your behavior and your

414
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:21,290
perception.
So these are,

415
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:24,830
these are archetipal metaphors.
That's one way of thinking about it.

416
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,130
And they have consequences.
The social immune system would help to

417
00:26:28,131 --> 00:26:31,910
maintain order by suppressing any
actions or individuals that deviate from

418
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:34,160
a group's accepted social traditions.

419
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,070
If you're,
if

420
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:49,070
the cells in your body deviated enough
from the traditions of the other cells,

421
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:53,490
then what you develop is cancer.
So there's this idea,

422
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:54,481
there's,
there's,

423
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:56,340
it's not only an idea,
there's this,

424
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:01,500
there's this fundamental reality that a
certain amount of

425
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:08,710
stability and safety is to be held in
obedience to,

426
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,310
uh,
uh,

427
00:27:10,311 --> 00:27:11,540
structure of authority.

428
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,170
It has been reported that regions with
higher levels of disease prevalence tend

429
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:23,920
to be associated with higher levels of
social conformity and autocratic rule.

430
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:28,370
Individuals who feel more vulnerable to
disease likewise report higher levels of

431
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,330
ethnocentrism,
xenophobia.

432
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,420
And one of the things we do know about
socioeconomic status is that people who

433
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:38,440
are lower on the socioeconomic hierarchy
or more disgust sensitive.

434
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,130
Now the reasons for that or to exactly
clear,

435
00:27:42,131 --> 00:27:46,210
because people on the lower end of the
socioeconomic distribution on average

436
00:27:46,211 --> 00:27:51,211
also tend to have lower iqs and lower
iqs are associated with increased

437
00:27:52,121 --> 00:27:56,020
disgust sensitivity.
So there's the confounding effect of

438
00:27:56,021 --> 00:27:59,140
intelligence.
But by the same token,

439
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,820
if you're at the bottom of the dominance
hierarchy,

440
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,780
you are more prone to infectious disease
because you're,

441
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:09,220
you're stressed and vulnerable,
so there's real,

442
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:13,000
there's real reasons for you to be
careful about what you expose yourself

443
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:17,680
to if you're just clinging on to the
bottom of the hierarchy with both hands

444
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,090
or with one hand.

445
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:21,350
Yeah,

446
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,730
so it's basic concerns about pathogen
avoidance.

447
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:27,300
Me That's contributed to the desire for
order and tradition among conservatives

448
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,530
along with the harsh moral judgements
associated with violations of the social

449
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:32,364
order.

450
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,770
Because one of the things that's,
it's not easy to understand,

451
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,440
it's like you see this,
you see this a lot in the United States

452
00:28:39,441 --> 00:28:44,441
where the attraction of Republican
politics isn't limited to those at the

453
00:28:45,741 --> 00:28:48,620
top of the socioeconomic ladder.
In fact,

454
00:28:48,621 --> 00:28:52,850
the Republicans draw tremendous support
from people who were in the lower strata

455
00:28:52,851 --> 00:28:57,680
of the socioeconomic hierarchy.
Even though it seems quite clear by some

456
00:28:57,681 --> 00:29:02,681
standards that the policies that the
Republican's promote are not policies

457
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:07,660
that are going to help people who are at
the bottom of the socioeconomics

458
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:12,590
distribution if they stay there.
Now you could argue that the reason that

459
00:29:12,591 --> 00:29:16,460
the poor republican support the
Republicans is because they see

460
00:29:16,461 --> 00:29:20,420
themselves as able to climb the
hierarchy and so they're voting their

461
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,350
dream and north the reality,
but you could also make a case.

462
00:29:24,351 --> 00:29:28,000
I believe that
the people at the bottom of the

463
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:31,240
hierarchy are already so stressed that
if you add more variability into the

464
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:35,380
system,
then that increases the probability that

465
00:29:35,381 --> 00:29:39,670
they're going to be completely
overwhelmed by chaos and the more

466
00:29:39,671 --> 00:29:42,550
stressed they are,
the more the higher the probability that

467
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:45,940
they're going to suffer ill health for
one reason or another.

468
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,650
So perhaps part of the reason for the
desire to maintain social integrity,

469
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:51,940
even if you're at the bottom of the
heap,

470
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:55,900
is because some orders better than none,
especially if you're already stressed to

471
00:29:55,901 --> 00:29:56,734
your limit.

472
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:02,030
Severe moral judgment may be a key
mechanism by which the social immune

473
00:30:02,031 --> 00:30:06,230
system instantiated and conservative
practices and policies aims to eliminate

474
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,370
exposure to deviant social elements that
may increase the risk of pathogen

475
00:30:10,371 --> 00:30:13,580
exposure.
According to a parasite stress

476
00:30:13,581 --> 00:30:15,650
hypothesis,
authoritarian governments are more

477
00:30:15,651 --> 00:30:18,950
likely to emerge in regions
characterized by a high prevalence of

478
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:23,420
disease causing pathogens.
Recent cross national evidence is

479
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,570
consistent with this hypothesis,
but there are inferential limitations

480
00:30:26,571 --> 00:30:29,510
associated with that evidence.
We report to studies that address some

481
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:32,150
of these limitations and provide further
tests of the hypothesis.

482
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,120
This is the paper I mentioned before
from plause one.

483
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,860
Um,
unfortunately I didn't put the title of

484
00:30:39,861 --> 00:30:44,660
it here.
If you type into Google authoritarianism

485
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:49,990
and parasite prevalence and you look for
plause one p l o s one,

486
00:30:50,121 --> 00:30:54,050
you'll find it right away.
Study one or revealed that parasite

487
00:30:54,051 --> 00:30:58,370
prevalence strongly predicted cross
national differences on measures

488
00:30:58,371 --> 00:31:02,030
assessing individual's authoritarian
personalities and this effect

489
00:31:02,031 --> 00:31:05,650
statistically mediated the relationship
between parasite prevalence and the

490
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,490
authoritarian governance.
The mediation result is inconsistent

491
00:31:10,491 --> 00:31:13,400
with an alternative explanation for
previous findings

492
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:19,460
to address further limitations
associated with cross national

493
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:23,060
comparisons.
Study two tested the parasite stress

494
00:31:23,061 --> 00:31:27,950
hypothesis on a sample of traditional
small scale societies.

495
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,630
Revolts re results revealed that
parasite prevalence predicted measures

496
00:31:32,631 --> 00:31:37,010
of authoritarian governance and did so
even when statistically controlling for

497
00:31:37,011 --> 00:31:39,620
other threats to human welfare.
One additional threat.

498
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:43,100
Famine also uniquely predicted
authoritarianism.

499
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,070
Together these results further
substantiate the parasite stress

500
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:52,480
hypothesis of authoritarianism and
suggested societal differences and

501
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:56,020
authoritarian governance result in part
from cultural differences in

502
00:31:56,021 --> 00:31:58,360
individuals,
authoritarians personalities.

503
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:04,560
So there is a correlation table.
So the correlation between authoritarian

504
00:32:05,081 --> 00:32:08,080
governance and pathogen prevalence is
0.42.

505
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,453
Okay.

506
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:15,740
That's higher than the correlation
between Iq and academic performance at

507
00:32:15,741 --> 00:32:20,741
the University of Toronto by quite a
substantial margin 0.42 especially in a

508
00:32:20,871 --> 00:32:23,390
sample of this size because it was a
very large sample.

509
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,740
That's about as big a correlation
coefficient as you're ever going to see

510
00:32:27,741 --> 00:32:31,460
between two two variables,
one of which is psychological.

511
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:32,870
So that would be the,
the,

512
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,930
the uh,
authoritarian is 12 item index of

513
00:32:35,931 --> 00:32:38,510
authoritarian governance.
So one of the things to remember,

514
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,290
it's only a item questionnaire that's
not a very good questionnaire.

515
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:47,450
So there's a lot of measurement error in
that and that actually in a situation

516
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:51,080
like this that actually means the true
correlation is higher because lack of

517
00:32:51,081 --> 00:32:55,370
reliability is going to like cause if
your measure isn't reliable and isn't

518
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:58,160
completely valid than some of what it
measures is going to be noise.

519
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,570
And so the true correlation could easily
be 0.5

520
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,680
fam and adds another 0.26
it's quite staggering.

521
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,433
Now

522
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:25,000
I want to walk you through some
potential consequences of this and some

523
00:33:25,001 --> 00:33:26,920
of this is speculative in some of it
isn't.

524
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,610
One of the things I want you to remember
is that

525
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:36,960
the end of World War One,
the biggest flu influenza epidemic and

526
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:42,260
that was ever recorded in history hit
and it killed four times as many people

527
00:33:42,431 --> 00:33:45,760
as the first world war.
So that's,

528
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,810
you got to keep that in mind.
Or Germany lost the first world war and

529
00:33:49,811 --> 00:33:54,811
they suffered a harsh reparation burden
as a consequence of the peace treaty

530
00:33:54,971 --> 00:33:59,470
that was signed at Versailles.
And then during the 1920s

531
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:06,330
the German economy collapsed completely
so that people were taking wheelbarrows

532
00:34:06,701 --> 00:34:09,160
full of money to the corner store to buy
bread.

533
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:11,563
So

534
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,840
you can imagine that those,
the war,

535
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:23,130
the flu and the catastrophic
catastrophic inflation set the stage for

536
00:34:25,391 --> 00:34:29,920
German political thinking,
certainly what happened to the Germans

537
00:34:29,921 --> 00:34:34,921
could be regarded as immensely chaotic
in a society that's collapsed into

538
00:34:39,231 --> 00:34:42,380
chaos,
you're going to get an unconscious

539
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,480
or conscious demand for the imposition
of order.

540
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,170
And one thing Hitler was good at was
ordered.

541
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,230
You look at that picture on the left
hand side,

542
00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:00,190
that's tens of thousands of people
all organized into basically perfect

543
00:35:00,971 --> 00:35:04,930
squares.
And you remember how the Nazis marched?

544
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,920
They did the goose step and they did an
absolutely precisely

545
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,050
Hitler was certainly willing to
subordinate the individual freedom of

546
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:25,051
the Germans that the ariens let's say to
his overall vision and believed in fact

547
00:35:26,531 --> 00:35:29,620
that the individual should be
subordinate to the overall vision.

548
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,200
And he was certainly willing to
sacrifice

549
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,610
anyone or anything that deviated from
the,

550
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:41,430
from inclusion within this pure ordered
body.

551
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:53,510
So that
that's a photograph of the Nuremberg

552
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:58,890
Nazi party rally grounds
from quite a distance.

553
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:03,480
The light that you see that's horizontal
across the bottom is the front of the

554
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:07,160
stage.
The lights shining upward are the loofah

555
00:36:07,161 --> 00:36:09,750
office,
antiaircraft lights,

556
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:15,180
all arrayed around the parade ground and
shining straight up.

557
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:22,340
So use the symbolism of light against
darkness as an adjunct to his political

558
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,610
maneuvering.
You could see the absolute order that's

559
00:36:26,611 --> 00:36:30,990
portrayed in that massive sculpture of
light.

560
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,183
Okay?

561
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,910
You can see in the top left hand corner
there,

562
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,840
the precise precision with with which
everyone is lined up.

563
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,420
So they make perfectly geometrical
patterns.

564
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:01,150
And then on the right,
and this,

565
00:37:01,151 --> 00:37:05,030
this is a small stadium for a political
gathering compared to what the Nazis

566
00:37:05,031 --> 00:37:08,630
were planning.
Albert speer was planning to build a

567
00:37:08,631 --> 00:37:11,780
stadium for such rallies that would have
had 400,000 seats.

568
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,780
So I think the typical football stadium
has about 60,000

569
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,270
so you see on the right,
everyone perfectly aligned,

570
00:37:23,271 --> 00:37:28,271
everyone perfectly uniform and masses
and masses and rows of people all

571
00:37:28,301 --> 00:37:31,460
ordered in precise perfection.

572
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:46,120
This is a piece of Nazi propaganda from
the 1930s this,

573
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,460
the rest of this lecture is going to be
very disturbing,

574
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:53,810
but I want to show you what happened as
far as I can tell.

575
00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:00,530
When Hitler came to power,
his fundamental

576
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:07,810
goal was to purify what he thought of as
the area in body.

577
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,810
And I want to show you how he went about
doing that.

578
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:17,890
So that's wording from a Nazi propaganda
folder.

579
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:23,150
The people of the world will recognize
the Jew as world parasite and there will

580
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:26,960
be a time when there will be one united
front of all people against the Jewish

581
00:38:26,961 --> 00:38:29,900
world,
parasite and humanity will be freed from

582
00:38:29,901 --> 00:38:32,990
the most severe illness from which it
suffered for thousands of years.

583
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,730
Now,
the reason I picked those words

584
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:39,580
precisely is because you can see the
body metaphor lying underneath that it's

585
00:38:39,581 --> 00:38:40,630
direct.
It's not,

586
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:45,750
it's not even subtle.
Now,

587
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:53,040
these are
pieces of Hitler's spontaneous speech

588
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,090
that we're organized from mine comp.

589
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,470
These are all metaphors of disease that
he used in his speeches and writing.

590
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:09,320
It's from a book by Richard Koenigsberg,
w called embodied metaphor,

591
00:39:09,321 --> 00:39:14,321
fantasy and history.
Since the state did not possess the

592
00:39:14,631 --> 00:39:18,200
power to master the disease,
the menacing decay of the Reich was

593
00:39:18,201 --> 00:39:22,250
manifest.
The masses feel that the mere fact of

594
00:39:22,251 --> 00:39:24,770
the Jews existences as bad as the
plague.

595
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:29,510
Politicians tinkering around on the
German national body saw it.

596
00:39:29,511 --> 00:39:31,340
Most of the forms of our general
disease,

597
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:36,020
but blindly ignored the virus.
At the tail time of the unification,

598
00:39:36,021 --> 00:39:39,770
the inner decay was already in full
swing and the general situation was

599
00:39:39,771 --> 00:39:44,390
deteriorating from year to year.
The Nation did not grow inwardly

600
00:39:44,391 --> 00:39:47,240
healthier,
but obviously languished more and more.

601
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:51,350
The symptoms of decay of the prewar
period can be reduced to racial causes.

602
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:56,210
Anybody who wants to cure this era,
which was inwardly sick and rotten,

603
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:00,320
must first of all sum up the courage to
make clear the causes of this disease.

604
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,410
They think that they must demonstrate
that they are ready for appeasement.

605
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:09,200
That's the English I believe so as to
stay the deadly cancerous all through a

606
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:14,000
policy of moderation.
The Jew must take care that the plague

607
00:40:14,001 --> 00:40:17,090
does not die.
If this battle should not come,

608
00:40:17,091 --> 00:40:21,080
Germany would decay and it basket sync
to ruin like a rotting corpse.

609
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:25,520
You can see in the right today an
example of mortal dk.

610
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,710
The 1st of May can only,
it can be only the liberation of the

611
00:40:30,711 --> 00:40:34,640
nation spirit from the infection of
internationalism and the restoration

612
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,020
health of all the peoples

613
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,120
against the infection of materialism
against the Jewish pestilence,

614
00:40:41,121 --> 00:40:43,460
we must hold a loft,
a flaming ideal.

615
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,330
One of the things that's also extremely
interesting about Hitler's use of

616
00:40:47,331 --> 00:40:51,560
propaganda was his intense fascination
with fire.

617
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,260
And the thing about fire is that it's a
purifying elements to purifying elements

618
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:58,280
symbolically as well.
You know,

619
00:40:58,281 --> 00:41:00,890
when,
when the Second World War was coming to

620
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:05,120
a close and things had gone
catastrophically wrong for the Germans,

621
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:11,050
Hitler became extremely disenchanted
with his people and undertook actions

622
00:41:13,311 --> 00:41:18,311
that were by all appearances designed to
increase the degree to which Germany was

623
00:41:19,341 --> 00:41:23,660
destroyed.
And it seems to me that that,

624
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:27,200
and this is,
this is this kind of ties into the

625
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:31,790
Friday and idea of a death wish.
I think that Hitler had this fantasy

626
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:35,090
that he laid out over his whole,
that the best thing that could happen to

627
00:41:35,091 --> 00:41:38,630
life if it wasn't pure was that it
should be burnt in fire.

628
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,990
And I think that's what happened in the
Second World War.

629
00:41:41,991 --> 00:41:45,770
I think he lived that right out to its
ultimate conclusion because he shot

630
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:47,990
himself in a bunker when Berlin was
burning,

631
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,371
you know?
And,

632
00:41:49,371 --> 00:41:52,520
and how fire has historically been used
for purification?

633
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,400
You know,
it's not for no reason that many

634
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:58,130
cultures burn bodies after people die.

635
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:00,560
Okay.

636
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,560
The restoration to health of our people
must start from the restoration to

637
00:42:06,081 --> 00:42:10,820
health of the body politic.
I give the order to burn out down to the

638
00:42:10,821 --> 00:42:14,090
raw flesh,
the ulcers of this poisoning of the

639
00:42:14,091 --> 00:42:18,160
wells.
You can't get much more direct than

640
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:18,994
that.

641
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:20,410
Okay.

642
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:24,400
The only way permanently to cure disease
conditions is to disclose their causes.

643
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,530
Infections in countries lead to a
crippling of intelligence and of the

644
00:42:29,531 --> 00:42:32,740
forces of resistance.
This is the battle against a veritable

645
00:42:32,741 --> 00:42:35,740
world sickness which threatens to infect
the people's a plague,

646
00:42:35,741 --> 00:42:39,070
which devastates whole peoples and
international pestilence.

647
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,520
The international carrier of the
Bacillus must be fought.

648
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,670
If within this community,
one state is infected,

649
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:49,750
that infection is decisive for all alike
in Europe,

650
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:54,160
no common life of the nations and
possible is possible when amongst their

651
00:42:54,161 --> 00:42:56,230
number.
There are some who are suffering from a

652
00:42:56,231 --> 00:43:00,400
poisonous infection and who openly
profess their desire to infect others

653
00:43:00,401 --> 00:43:04,480
with the same disease.
We have a very real interest in seeing

654
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:06,940
it,
seeing to it that this bolshevist plague

655
00:43:06,941 --> 00:43:10,480
shall not spread over Europe.
Same terminology applied to the

656
00:43:10,481 --> 00:43:13,300
Communists,
the communist threat moving in from the

657
00:43:13,301 --> 00:43:16,300
east.
National Socialism has made our people

658
00:43:16,301 --> 00:43:19,120
and therefore the right immune from a
Bolshevik infection.

659
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:23,380
For hundreds of years,
Germany was good enough to receive these

660
00:43:23,381 --> 00:43:24,790
elements.
Jews,

661
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:27,010
although they possessed nothing except
infectious,

662
00:43:27,011 --> 00:43:31,170
political and physical diseases,
only when this Jewish Bacillus effecting

663
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:34,780
the life of peoples has been removed.
Can one hope to establish a cooperation

664
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:37,720
amongst the nations?
Well,

665
00:43:37,721 --> 00:43:38,650
you get the picture.

666
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:50,740
I want to show you something now.
This is from a particularly pernicious

667
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,730
propaganda film that was produced by the
Nazis.

668
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,530
1344 2041

669
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:25,910
yeah.
Okay.

670
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:40,510
Choice.
They settled there mercilessly.

671
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,970
Totally different racial elements differ
from us.

672
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:08,250
We probably would never been bothered by
them

673
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,630
and
especially

674
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:25,980
the Romans brought about the evolution
of the trade and migratory traits soon

675
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,290
spread across the open Mediterranean
area.

676
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,390
While some of them settled in the large
urban centers of the Mediterranean,

677
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:42,070
others wandered relentlessly on across
Spain,

678
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,620
France,
southern Germany,

679
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,830
and England.
Everywhere.

680
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,790
They made themselves unwelcome in Spain
and France.

681
00:47:51,791 --> 00:47:55,330
The people grows overlay against the
13th or 14th century,

682
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,440
mainly the German
culture,

683
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,770
creative Germans colonizing the east
until they finally found the gigantic

684
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:15,060
reservoir in the Polish and Russian
sections of in

685
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:21,280
the 19th century with its model.
Ideas about human equality and freedom

686
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,150
is a great lip.
Eastern Europe,

687
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:28,660
they spread across the entire continent
during the 19th and 20th centuries and

688
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:33,670
then across the
parallel to the Jewish monitoring

689
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:48,110
throughout the world is the migration of
similarly restless animal,

690
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:53,900
the
rat seven parasites from the very

691
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,110
beginning,
the most,

692
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:00,400
they might read it in gigantic Korea or
Russia

693
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,110
or the middle of the 18th century.

694
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:11,140
It's straight over all of Europe,
where the end of the 19th century was

695
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:15,180
the growing and shipping traffic.
They dispossessed of America,

696
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,440
Africa,
and

697
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:30,000
harass turn up.
They carry the structure of the lab,

698
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:35,730
but as frying mankind's goods and
spreading diseases this way,

699
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,800
so just cholera,
dysentery,

700
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:44,460
leprosy and typhoid fever
solidly and unusually a beard and a

701
00:49:50,181 --> 00:49:53,920
massive born.
They represent the elements of

702
00:49:53,921 --> 00:49:57,380
sneakiness and subterranean disruption
among animals

703
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:01,390
just as the Jews knew,
among

704
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:16,350
parasite,
responsible for a large part of the

705
00:50:16,351 --> 00:50:21,351
international crime.
On that 32 the Jews who made up only 1%

706
00:50:21,911 --> 00:50:26,911
of the world's population,
about 34% of the world's don't members,

707
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:32,890
47%
47% are for the games of chance percent

708
00:50:35,361 --> 00:50:40,361
look international crime organizations,
98% of dealers and prostitutes

709
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:51,620
in the jargon of international gangsters
stem from Hebrew and yiddish words,

710
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:58,150
lease cars,
the automobiles immediately liberal

711
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,230
theory,
the equality of all when they're

712
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:05,573
older.

713
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:12,260
Well,
I'll show you the four minutes

714
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:30,010
recognizable
when spot is racial origin

715
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,560
is that the oldest tries to hide his
origin.

716
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:42,810
When a mom
still wearing cap towns

717
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:11,980
in western European clothes repairing,
infiltrate the Western civilization

718
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:25,140
and of course these ghetto Jews don't
get moved to,

719
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:27,320
well,
they're clean and European bloats

720
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:30,010
somewhat more wanted that.
How did you,

721
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:33,660
was Oberlin,
their fathers and grandfathers,

722
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:40,700
but that's not really noticeable here in
the second and third generation.

723
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:46,620
I don't relate to.
They tried to add just like the host

724
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:52,200
people
instincts and let themselves be the

725
00:52:52,411 --> 00:52:57,020
seat,
but this mimicry is the same as they

726
00:52:57,021 --> 00:53:00,900
are.
They will then lies the enormous danger.

727
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:06,020
These assimilated was remain forever
foreign bodies and the organism or the

728
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:08,600
host vehicles regardless.
I love Arizona.

729
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:22,250
That film has the dubious distinction of
being perhaps the most evil single piece

730
00:53:22,711 --> 00:53:27,270
of propaganda the Nazi's ever produced,
which is really saying something,

731
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:28,253
you know?

732
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,093
Yeah.

733
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:36,580
I mentioned something like this a couple
of weeks ago.

734
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:42,860
The thing that's so frightening about
this I think is that

735
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:45,940
okay

736
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,460
it,
it shows you in some sense how

737
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:54,360
delicately balanced society has to be in
order not to fall prey to a catastrophe

738
00:53:55,601 --> 00:53:57,370
on one side or a catastrophe on the
other.

739
00:53:57,371 --> 00:54:00,880
Because what we seem to be seeing here,
at least in part

740
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:07,560
is the
consequence of the overgeneralization

741
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:16,980
of a deeply inborn human trait,
some of whose consequences appear to be

742
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:22,450
necessary both for survival and
productivity.

743
00:54:22,451 --> 00:54:27,451
It would be such an easier problem if
you could take the cause which is at

744
00:54:28,901 --> 00:54:33,901
least in so far as this argument runs,
which is sensitivity to discussed

745
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,750
and just assume that that in it in its
entirety as a form of pathology,

746
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:45,780
but you can't do that because
sensitivity to discussed does protect

747
00:54:48,401 --> 00:54:49,720
people from pathogens,

748
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,920
but if you push it too far while then
things seem to fall apart in an

749
00:54:57,021 --> 00:55:01,250
absolutely atrocious way.
One of the things that I've found so

750
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:06,340
illuminating about this line of research
is that it answers a question that

751
00:55:07,161 --> 00:55:09,410
people have struggled with for a very
long period of time,

752
00:55:09,411 --> 00:55:14,411
which is how is it possible for human
beings to dehumanize other people?

753
00:55:14,691 --> 00:55:18,710
And the answer to this,
the answer that you would derive from

754
00:55:18,711 --> 00:55:23,420
this line of reasoning makes the
question quite mixed.

755
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:28,010
The answer quite obvious.
You just associate health with what

756
00:55:28,011 --> 00:55:32,900
you're trying to promote and to validate
and you associate that with purity and

757
00:55:32,901 --> 00:55:37,520
then you associate the other with
illness and disease.

758
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:42,790
And then you have a metaphor lying
underneath that that's just ready for

759
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:47,330
the taking.
And it's a powerful metaphor and it

760
00:55:47,331 --> 00:55:52,331
still seems to have immense effect on
people in so far as it is parasite

761
00:55:52,731 --> 00:55:56,110
prevalence that predicts authoritarian
political attitudes.

762
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,850
Now,
nope.

763
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,320
One of the things I don't understand is
how the,

764
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:08,030
one of the things we talked about in the
existential lectures was

765
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:14,420
the existential idea that one of the
things that promoted the development of

766
00:56:14,421 --> 00:56:19,421
totalitarian states was the willingness
of the people who were occupied by the

767
00:56:19,431 --> 00:56:23,240
totalitarian ideology to falsify their
own personal experience,

768
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:26,440
to keep it in accordance with the
totalitarian claims.

769
00:56:26,441 --> 00:56:28,210
So there was the idea of,
of the,

770
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,490
of the lie,
the Frankel makes much of,

771
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:37,530
I think maybe the lie in part is
it's gotta be something like the denial

772
00:56:42,541 --> 00:56:47,280
of your own identity with the
vulnerability that you want to shunt off

773
00:56:47,281 --> 00:56:51,210
into others and persecute,
you know,

774
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:55,260
the taking to yourself of everything
that constitutes purity and perfection.

775
00:56:55,830 --> 00:57:00,830
And then the lady,
the overburdening the other with

776
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:04,980
everything that you don't want to be
true about yourself.

777
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:08,340
It's true in the,

778
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:14,230
what you don't want to be true about
yourself is partly that actuality of

779
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:19,231
physical degeneration and decay.
But it seems to me that the reality of

780
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:24,280
moral degeneration and decay is a very,
very close analog to that they stack on

781
00:57:24,281 --> 00:57:29,170
top of one another.
And so maybe the lie is that you're not

782
00:57:29,171 --> 00:57:30,700
that,
but they are.

783
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:35,970
And that provides at least a partial
answer

784
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:40,303
anyways,

785
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:43,970
I don't have much more to say about that
today.

786
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,240
So maybe we could take some time for
questions

787
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:54,070
if you have any,
uh,

788
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:57,300
social,
uh,

789
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:03,530
immune system
balances better overall because you

790
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:11,361
think about children who are brazen
as they grow up to be adults with these

791
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:16,490
like crazy.
So it's almost like

792
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:23,110
a less conservative views.
It's almost like you're looking at it.

793
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,520
Oh,
that's interesting idea.

794
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,340
Well that's an interesting metaphoric
idea.

795
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:32,930
So the idea there would be that by
insisting upon radical purity,

796
00:58:32,931 --> 00:58:37,100
you actually weaken a society a just
like you would weaken and an immune

797
00:58:37,101 --> 00:58:37,934
system.

798
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,150
But then if you expose yourself to those
ideas,

799
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:46,540
then when you go into
a broad spectrum of like whatever kind

800
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:52,443
of,

801
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,281
well,
that's a pretty good,

802
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:58,370
that would be pretty good defense of the
idea of a liberal education.

803
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:00,080
You know,
because on the one hand,

804
00:59:00,081 --> 00:59:01,610
if you're a fundamentalist,
you're going to say,

805
00:59:01,611 --> 00:59:03,020
well,
you,

806
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:07,670
you're only going to be taught the ideas
that are exactly in keeping with the

807
00:59:07,671 --> 00:59:11,300
most pure of doctrines of your people.
But as you,

808
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:13,190
as you pointed out,
quite rightly,

809
00:59:13,191 --> 00:59:17,630
that means that the second you step
outside of that protective influence and

810
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:20,870
you hear any other ideas,
you're gone because you have no defense

811
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,040
them whatsoever.

812
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:24,793
Yeah,

813
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,570
yeah.
Well that's like a resilience argument

814
00:59:33,571 --> 00:59:35,150
fundamentally.
You know,

815
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:40,180
the idea and the liberal association
with openness would be something akin to

816
00:59:40,261 --> 00:59:40,801
that,
right?

817
00:59:40,801 --> 00:59:45,210
Because open people are interested new
experiences and new ideas and they value

818
00:59:45,211 --> 00:59:46,530
them.
Now

819
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:52,200
the reason that opened people are
interested in value them seems to be

820
00:59:52,201 --> 00:59:54,400
something pretty primordial.
They find new intro,

821
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:57,270
new ideas,
deeply meaningful and the tract.

822
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:01,560
But you can,
you can certainly be sure that

823
01:00:01,561 --> 01:00:06,561
throughout human history there's been
this tension between whether opening up

824
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,780
produces more longterm strengthening,
then rigidified and closing down.

825
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,970
Well it's a gamble.
You know,

826
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:23,540
liberal countries definitely take the
ladder strategy and you know,

827
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:30,060
there hasn't been a war of any
consequence between two liberal

828
01:00:30,061 --> 01:00:34,110
democracies.
So there is some historical evidence to

829
01:00:34,111 --> 01:00:37,320
suggest that it's working.
They're peaceful societies,

830
01:00:37,321 --> 01:00:42,210
general speaking internally as well.
So other questions?

831
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:43,703
Yes.

832
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:53,620
One of them.

833
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,630
Well,
most of this research is still in its

834
01:01:11,631 --> 01:01:14,060
infancy and the,
you know,

835
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:16,520
the strength,
the strength of the association between

836
01:01:16,521 --> 01:01:18,980
socioeconomic status and disgust
sensitivity.

837
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:22,760
I would say that's something that's been
more suggested than something that's,

838
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:28,230
you know,
demonstrated and attributed to increased

839
01:01:28,241 --> 01:01:30,080
disgust,
sensitivity at the lower end of the

840
01:01:30,081 --> 01:01:30,914
spectrum.

841
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:31,873
So,

842
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:33,901
yeah,
well,

843
01:01:33,901 --> 01:01:36,240
everything I told you today,
it's still a hypothesis.

844
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,940
You know,
it's because it's all new.

845
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:40,540
It's new,
it's all,

846
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:45,510
all of this data has been gathered
within the last 15 years,

847
01:01:45,511 --> 01:01:48,750
10 or 15 years.
And so people are still trying to sort

848
01:01:48,751 --> 01:01:50,490
out what it means.
I mean,

849
01:01:50,491 --> 01:01:54,990
I think that study I showed you showing
the correlation of point,

850
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:56,100
was it,
what was it?

851
01:01:56,110 --> 01:02:01,110
Point four 5.4 9.42 b between a
authoritarian political attitudes and

852
01:02:04,831 --> 01:02:06,210
parasite prevalence.
That's,

853
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,050
that's a jaw dropping study.
Who the hell would have ever guessed

854
01:02:10,051 --> 01:02:11,070
that?
You know,

855
01:02:11,071 --> 01:02:14,070
when it makes sense in retrospect,
when you look at,

856
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:17,430
say,
Hitler's propaganda and the discussions

857
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,790
in light of that data.
But as far as I could tell,

858
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:26,450
well,
this sort of material just hasn't been

859
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,670
brought together before by historians.

860
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,650
I do you know that that's a good
question too because it's not exactly

861
01:03:01,651 --> 01:03:05,220
clear.
I don't think it's exactly clear why

862
01:03:05,221 --> 01:03:10,170
authoritarian attitudes would mean.
What are the implications of the paper

863
01:03:10,171 --> 01:03:14,430
fundamentally is that there's,
there's a reason that authoritarian

864
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:17,040
attitudes appear when there's parasite
prevalence.

865
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:19,500
The court,
the association is very strong,

866
01:03:19,501 --> 01:03:22,290
so one of the things you could infer
from that was that there's actually some

867
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:25,530
utility in it now.
Perhaps not.

868
01:03:25,531 --> 01:03:30,531
Perhaps it's only that if you're so
stressed by disease and parasites and so

869
01:03:31,831 --> 01:03:34,080
forth,
you just don't want to have anything to

870
01:03:34,081 --> 01:03:39,081
do with any other kind of uncertainty or
maybe it's that you revert to extremely

871
01:03:39,181 --> 01:03:43,710
traditional and order bound ways of
interacting in an attempt to decrease

872
01:03:43,711 --> 01:03:47,100
the probability that you'll be exposed,
exposed to the parasites.

873
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:48,780
I don't know.

874
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:57,870
Do you think it's related to
Zombie survival TV shows and infection

875
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:02,380
yet the band together?

876
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:05,881
Oh yeah,
sure.

877
01:04:05,881 --> 01:04:08,980
It's exactly the same sort of thing.
Yeah.

878
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,290
The funny thing,
the Zombie,

879
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:14,340
the Zombie idea though puts a weird
twist on it that was more associated

880
01:04:14,341 --> 01:04:16,050
with your hypothesis,
which is that,

881
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:19,590
you know,
the zombies are also often mindlessly

882
01:04:19,591 --> 01:04:24,591
obedient and then they become
diseased and decaying and dad and,

883
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,260
and,
and uh,

884
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:29,730
uh,
cannibalistic.

885
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:35,100
So
it definitely does seem to be the case

886
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:39,000
that if you take many virtues too far,
they produce exactly the consequence

887
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:41,460
that the person that was pushing them
wants to avoid.

888
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:47,210
So that seems to me to be a really good
argument against the extension of

889
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:52,230
the idea of orderliness too far.
It's going to kick back and produce a

890
01:04:52,231 --> 01:04:55,170
hell of a lot more chaos than you think
if you don't keep it in balance with the

891
01:04:55,171 --> 01:04:56,670
other.
You know,

892
01:04:56,671 --> 01:05:01,671
because one of the things that the big
five model seems to indicate is that in

893
01:05:02,311 --> 01:05:04,620
order to keep yourself oriented in the
environment,

894
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:10,050
you have to have five dimensions of
value because otherwise there wouldn't

895
01:05:10,051 --> 01:05:11,820
be five dimensions of value,
right.

896
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,780
And maybe if you collapse everything
into a single dimension,

897
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:20,350
you tighten down so much that they can
no longer function properly.

898
01:05:20,351 --> 01:05:24,550
And then everything tends to deteriorate
into chaos and there's gotta be a

899
01:05:24,551 --> 01:05:26,080
reason.
There's five dimensions,

900
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:28,840
you know,
so you have to regulate your social

901
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:30,700
behavior.
That would be extroversion at least to

902
01:05:30,701 --> 01:05:34,640
some degree.
You have to respond to threat and

903
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:39,650
punishment.
You have to care for or exploit other

904
01:05:40,301 --> 01:05:42,360
people roughly.
No,

905
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:44,590
you have to care for other people and
care for yourself.

906
01:05:44,591 --> 01:05:47,950
That would be agreeableness.
I would say disgust,

907
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:51,370
conscientiousness at length,
and then of course openness is basically

908
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:56,590
the intake of new information.
You have to solve all five of those

909
01:05:56,591 --> 01:05:59,830
problems in order for things to remain
in some kind of reasonable balance.

910
01:06:00,430 --> 01:06:04,090
You might even be able to make a case
that if you want to keep a society

911
01:06:04,091 --> 01:06:07,450
optimally organized,
given that there's variability on each

912
01:06:07,451 --> 01:06:10,810
of those dimensions,
you have to keep a conversation going

913
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:15,460
between everyone in that five
dimensional space regardless of where

914
01:06:15,461 --> 01:06:18,310
they're located on the,
on the distribution.

915
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:23,310
Because
if the idea is to optimize the fit of

916
01:06:24,941 --> 01:06:29,710
the society to the shape of the
environment at any given time,

917
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:33,700
that's going to be a very complicated
problem because you don't exactly know

918
01:06:33,701 --> 01:06:38,410
what shape the environment is.
So if you could keep the dialogue going

919
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:42,400
between all the interested parties,
maybe you can move this society along

920
01:06:42,401 --> 01:06:45,850
properly and keep it matched enough to
the environment so that it can stay

921
01:06:45,851 --> 01:06:49,390
healthy.
And if you tilt it too much in the

922
01:06:49,391 --> 01:06:52,630
direction of any of these unit
dimensional values,

923
01:06:52,631 --> 01:06:56,890
then it's gonna.
It's going to increase the probability

924
01:06:56,891 --> 01:07:01,660
that it'll collapse.
That could be because otherwise I can't

925
01:07:01,661 --> 01:07:03,580
understand why there would be five
dimensions.

926
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:05,410
They must be,
they're necessary,

927
01:07:05,411 --> 01:07:06,670
obviously,
in some sense.

928
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:10,620
So
other questions?

929
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:13,410
So what do you think?
Yup.

930
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:20,140
Correlation between
one sort of conservative.

931
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,051
Yeah.
Well,

932
01:07:22,051 --> 01:07:23,460
I made,
I made an analogy.

933
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:24,383
Yeah.

934
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,040
Uh,
which one was that?

935
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,910
Well,
if your sales go ahead and do their own

936
01:07:29,911 --> 01:07:32,880
thing,
then you develop cancer.

937
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:36,270
Right?
My point being that if you're going to

938
01:07:36,271 --> 01:07:39,810
organize,
because I individual entities into a

939
01:07:39,811 --> 01:07:43,290
higher order structure,
there's obviously some minimum of

940
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:48,291
cooperation.
And what would you call similarity,

941
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:52,830
uniformity between those members or it's
not going to work.

942
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:55,260
And the question is always how uniform
you should be.

943
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,500
I mean the [inaudible],
the idea was that you should be uniform

944
01:07:58,800 --> 01:07:59,930
and everything,
you know,

945
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:04,080
basically you would be just one person.
I think that probably does,

946
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:12,000
that does bear some similarity to the
case that you made because what you see

947
01:08:12,001 --> 01:08:16,130
in extremely authoritarian states as
they are trying to reduce the,

948
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:21,230
the,
the human complexity to the

949
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:24,980
manifestation of a single personality.
And the problem with that is that if

950
01:08:24,981 --> 01:08:27,680
that single personalities matched
perfectly to the environment,

951
01:08:27,681 --> 01:08:29,030
it's going to be extremely efficient.

952
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:32,630
But the probability that it's going to
be perfectly matched is basically zero.

953
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:36,440
There's too many possible environments.
And so if the authoritarians push all

954
01:08:36,441 --> 01:08:39,110
the variability out of the state,
which is what they want to do,

955
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,910
then it's going to weaken it across
time,

956
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:43,220
not strengthen it.
I mean,

957
01:08:43,221 --> 01:08:46,640
most political battles you have to fight
on the turf of your opponent,

958
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,350
right?
Because they're not gonna listen,

959
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:50,750
like left wingers and right wingers
never listened to each other.

960
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:53,780
So if you want to communicate with
someone who is on the right,

961
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:56,390
you have to communicate using the
language of the right.

962
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:58,250
If you want to communicate with someone
on the left,

963
01:08:58,251 --> 01:09:00,980
do you have to communicate using the
language on the left,

964
01:09:00,981 --> 01:09:03,290
at least roughly speaking because
they're,

965
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:06,110
the values differ.
So the strongest case you would make

966
01:09:06,111 --> 01:09:09,620
against right wing authoritarianism
would be that the authoritarianism

967
01:09:09,621 --> 01:09:14,621
itself pushed too far would endanger the
values that the conservatives themselves

968
01:09:14,931 --> 01:09:18,230
water maintain.
That's a hard argument to refute.

969
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:23,650
That wasn't their prime example not too
long ago where there they did a study

970
01:09:23,651 --> 01:09:27,190
where they change the semantic,
just like the wording of something.

971
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,710
Yeah.
Pollution.

972
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:30,231
Yeah.
Yeah.

973
01:09:30,231 --> 01:09:32,940
I see you.
If you appeal to purity concerns when

974
01:09:32,941 --> 01:09:35,010
you're doing environmental,
um,

975
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:36,330
agitating,
let's say,

976
01:09:36,331 --> 01:09:41,331
or messaging purity concerns are much
more effective or on conservatives.

977
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:43,350
So you can show them,
you know,

978
01:09:43,351 --> 01:09:45,420
pictures of polluted water and that sort
of thing.

979
01:09:45,421 --> 01:09:47,250
They're quite responsive to that kind of
thing.

980
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:49,740
You know,
rather than we should respect our animal

981
01:09:49,741 --> 01:09:51,810
friends,
which would be something that would be

982
01:09:51,811 --> 01:09:54,270
more appealing to someone who's on the
liberal side of things.

983
01:09:54,271 --> 01:09:56,130
Because they tend to be more
egalitarian.

984
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:59,730
So what do you think about having been
shown that film?

985
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:03,770
Is that an acceptable thing to do in a
class?

986
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,580
What did people say?
Anybody think?

987
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:12,780
Not you can say so.
I'm curious.

988
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:14,510
Okay.

989
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:17,210
So that was all right.
Yeah,

990
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:24,600
yeah,
yeah.

991
01:10:24,601 --> 01:10:27,300
Well I'd have to bar the doors
otherwise.

992
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,510
Yeah.
Yes.

993
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,790
Well I don't like,
I don't think that you can,

994
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:44,300
you can combat anything.
You can,

995
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:46,990
you don't understand.
The problem is,

996
01:10:46,991 --> 01:10:49,270
is that understanding some things isn't
very pleasant,

997
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:52,060
you know,
because once you understand them,

998
01:10:52,190 --> 01:10:55,660
this is a Rogerian perspective.
Once you understand them.

999
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:57,690
Yeah.

1000
01:10:57,690 --> 01:11:00,570
To understand something is to see how
it's allowable.

1001
01:11:00,571 --> 01:11:03,890
He human,
otherwise you don't understand it.

1002
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:05,900
And that's not good.
That's rough.

1003
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:09,010
There's like a weird paradox that
exists.

1004
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:10,930
The,
while I'm watching this,

1005
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:14,750
I feel that my viewpoints,
uh,

1006
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:15,620
would be,
uh,

1007
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:19,350
if someone who embodied the idea alone
that isn't a bill,

1008
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:22,710
where did directly be opposed to like my
position,

1009
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:26,100
but,
and feel that my views and way of life,

1010
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,050
you know,
living in Canadian society,

1011
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:29,910
uh,
is cancerous.

1012
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,920
But here I am sitting like watching this
film and I'm thinking of like,

1013
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:35,940
Oh God,
I can't imagine that they can't.

1014
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:36,990
It's just a cancer,
isn't it?

1015
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:38,733
So

1016
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:40,330
yeah.

1017
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:43,530
Yeah.
Well I mean the Nazis claims very much

1018
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:46,810
antithetical to western liberal claims
in every possible way.

1019
01:11:46,811 --> 01:11:51,640
I mean they viewed in modern society,
we think of being cosmopolitan has a

1020
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,560
virtue.
You know what it means is no matter

1021
01:11:53,561 --> 01:11:55,120
where you go,
you're,

1022
01:11:55,121 --> 01:11:59,470
you could adapt for the Nazis.
That meant you'd been fatally corrupted.

1023
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:06,320
How are you
attached to a persona or two,

1024
01:12:06,321 --> 01:12:10,510
one personality trait of themselves and
so cyclical apology happens.

1025
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:15,770
I was thinking that we do something like
this all the time when we make a mistake

1026
01:12:15,771 --> 01:12:19,860
where we said like there's a part of us
that is irresponsible that I just need

1027
01:12:19,861 --> 01:12:23,210
to like just crush your,
just the control entirely.

1028
01:12:23,211 --> 01:12:26,540
I just want to be this copy intelligent
person.

1029
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,860
You want to move and we try to crush
everything else.

1030
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:34,980
That's a good segue into the existential
idea of the lie

1031
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:41,570
because the psychoanalysts constantly
reminded people that there was very much

1032
01:12:42,001 --> 01:12:47,001
danger in cutting off a particular part
of you and regarding it as diseased,

1033
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:48,360
you know,
and,

1034
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,680
and part of it,
I should have remembered that and you

1035
01:12:50,681 --> 01:12:52,710
know,
part of young's claim because he spent a

1036
01:12:52,711 --> 01:12:54,660
lot of time thinking about the Nazis,
was that

1037
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:58,920
if you alienate yourself from part of
yourself,

1038
01:12:58,921 --> 01:13:02,430
then you're going to do the same thing
to anyone who resembles that part of

1039
01:13:02,431 --> 01:13:03,264
yourself.

1040
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:06,810
And so you have to be very careful about
doing that.

1041
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,930
You know,
this guy named Eric [inaudible] who was

1042
01:13:09,931 --> 01:13:13,050
one of young students and he wrote a
book at the end of the second world war

1043
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:18,050
called depth psychology to new ethic.
And one of the things that noise

1044
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,610
proposed,
he was Jewish by the way.

1045
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:24,720
One of the things that Norman proposed
was that you don't try to be any better

1046
01:13:24,721 --> 01:13:28,950
than you are.
And by that he meant to not engage in

1047
01:13:28,951 --> 01:13:31,710
that kind of radical splitting.
He didn't mean you shouldn't try to

1048
01:13:31,711 --> 01:13:34,830
improve your moral character.
He meant that it's very dangerous to

1049
01:13:34,831 --> 01:13:39,831
pretend that you're entirely pure,
you know,

1050
01:13:40,411 --> 01:13:41,244
and,
and

1051
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:47,190
it's a tough one because you don't want
to eliminate the possibility of moral

1052
01:13:47,191 --> 01:13:48,480
striving,
obviously,

1053
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:50,100
because then there's no op,
right?

1054
01:13:50,101 --> 01:13:54,510
There's nothing to do that,
but it certainly has to be tempered with

1055
01:13:54,511 --> 01:13:55,350
some,
well,

1056
01:13:55,351 --> 01:13:57,000
probably tempered with compassion.

1057
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:01,080
And maybe that's the idea of tempering
and the personality trait domain.

1058
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:03,990
You know,
one of the things I do with people who

1059
01:14:03,991 --> 01:14:07,020
are agreeable because they don't stand
up for themselves very well.

1060
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:11,070
If they're agreeable and conscientious,
I encouraged them to tell the truth,

1061
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:13,540
you know,
because if they're being oppressed and

1062
01:14:13,541 --> 01:14:15,850
then they get resentful,
which always happens to agreeable

1063
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:18,190
people,
then I make a case that they have to

1064
01:14:18,191 --> 01:14:23,191
temper their agreeableness with some
conscientiousness and adopted as a moral

1065
01:14:24,431 --> 01:14:27,610
obligation to speak out on behalf of
themselves,

1066
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:29,860
despite the fact that they won't like
the conflict,

1067
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,380
you know?
And I guess if you're an orderly person.

1068
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:38,413
Yeah.

1069
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:44,050
My wife had a dream once about this that
I just remembered.

1070
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:48,310
She's quite an orderly person.
And she had a dream at one point that

1071
01:14:48,311 --> 01:14:52,930
she walked into an auditorium that was
full of people like this.

1072
01:14:52,931 --> 01:14:56,320
And she came down to the front of the
auditorium where all the men and the

1073
01:14:56,321 --> 01:15:01,240
dogs were and sat with them.
And that was a dream about the

1074
01:15:01,241 --> 01:15:03,520
relationship between orderliness and
agreeableness,

1075
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:05,070
is that,
you know,

1076
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:07,780
if you're orderly,
the problem is you can get so damn

1077
01:15:07,781 --> 01:15:11,050
orderly that can't stand people.
You can't stand men and dogs,

1078
01:15:11,051 --> 01:15:12,820
which was what her dream was basically,
you know,

1079
01:15:12,821 --> 01:15:14,750
she was making them equivalent,
you know,

1080
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:19,090
so dog shed all over the house and they
know they're annoying and stupid and you

1081
01:15:19,091 --> 01:15:21,190
know,
I guess men fit into that category too.

1082
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:26,610
But her dream pretty much said that that
was the proper place to sit and that

1083
01:15:26,611 --> 01:15:28,930
that was a very,
it was a very intelligent dream in that

1084
01:15:28,931 --> 01:15:30,460
regard.
You know?

1085
01:15:30,461 --> 01:15:32,740
So you temporary orderliness with
compassion.

1086
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:35,410
Likely that'd be my guess.
So,

1087
01:15:35,411 --> 01:15:37,810
and that was certainly not something
that happened with the Nazis.

1088
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:41,650
There was no compassion at all.
Only the desire to exterminate and to,

1089
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,230
and to,
and to kill.

1090
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:48,850
All right guys.
We'll see you on

1091
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:52,100
Tuesday one more week.
Kay.

1092
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:55,210
[inaudible].
