1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,360
So here's a brief note to tomorrow's 
student demonstrators.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,493
For those of you who don't know,
there's a demonstration plan for 

3
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:11,670
tomorrow.
They call it a rally and teaching,

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,280
um,
at Sydney Smith Hall,

5
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:16,140
that's 100 St George Street,
Toronto,

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,240
479 people are interested.
Two hundred and 32 people are going in.

7
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:24,930
1,100 people have been,
have had this missive shared with them.

8
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:29,130
And so this is the call to action 
released by people who are planning the,

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,350
um,
the rally.

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,920
And I'm addressing that for a number of 
reasons.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,420
Um,
but I'm only going to,

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,750
I'm going to stick to one very briefly.
The people who are putting out this call

13
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:43,740
to action say,
have said the following,

14
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:44,574
Jordan Peterson,
University of Toronto professor and 

15
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:47,034
practicing psychologist has released the
first of a plan three part video series 

16
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,260
of attacking political correctness and 
academia.

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,120
And this video he declares this proud 
unwillingness to call transgender people

18
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:59,310
by any pronouns he does not believe 
apply to them.

19
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,623
His disbelief in the very existence of 
non binary people and his belief that 

20
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:06,370
any attempts to challenge him or anyone 
else on these points,

21
00:01:06,371 --> 00:01:09,150
amount to Marxist fash fascism.
Okay.

22
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:09,984
So the first thing I would say is that I
do not regard any of those three 

23
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:16,650
statements about what I said as accurate
representations of what I said,

24
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,903
but I don't have time at the moment to 
do a detailed refutation of them point 

25
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:21,894
by point.
So I'm going to have to make this very 

26
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:23,844
straightforward and simple.
I don't disbelieve in the existence of 

27
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:30,420
non binary people.
Okay.

28
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:31,254
Do you want me to say that again?
Obviously people who don't fit into 

29
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,160
standard binary categories of sexual 
identity,

30
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,253
uh,
however you decide to construe that 

31
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,640
broadly or narrowly.
Obviously those people exist.

32
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,003
I never said they didn't exist.
What I said instead was that biological 

33
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,610
sex,
gender identity and gender expression do

34
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:56,760
not vary independently and they don't 
vary independently.

35
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,653
And we'll just leave it at that for now 
because I don't have enough time to go 

36
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:02,280
into the rest of it all the way will in 
the future.

37
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:03,114
So if you're going out tomorrow to this 
demonstration because you want to 

38
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,653
indicate your discomfort with my 
disbelief in the very existence of non 

39
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:15,750
binary people,
you might as well just stay home.
