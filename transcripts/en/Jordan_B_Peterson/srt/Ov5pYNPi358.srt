1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
Okay.
So we talked a lot about the brain last 

2
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:06,300
time and we're going to talk a little 
bit more about that.

3
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:10,350
And then we're going to talk about 
organization of hierarchical systems and

4
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:12,960
then we're going to talk about their 
representation in mythology.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,873
So this is from a paper by Swanson and 
Swanson has been studying the 

6
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:25,650
hypothalamus for a very long time and 
brain organization in general.

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,430
And the way he conceptualized as it is 
is in a rather piaget the incense.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,633
And so the,
the essential outputs of the nervous 

9
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:36,294
system are basically patterns of motor 
behavior and those are controlled by 

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,453
patterns of spinal cord activity.
And those are controlled by patterns 

11
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:47,760
that higher brain levels including the 
hypothalamus.

12
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:50,610
And then those are controlled by 
emotional systems.

13
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,400
There's patterned responses at the 
emotional level.

14
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:54,234
And then those are controlled by pattern
pattern responses at the level of the 

15
00:00:58,171 --> 00:00:59,004
cortex.

16
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,090
And the body sort of builds itself from 
the bottom up.

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,513
Um,
and as it builds itself from the bottom 

18
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:09,780
up,
it's trying to integrate the function of

19
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:10,614
all the systems that are necessary for 
the maintenance of the biological 

20
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:17,760
maintenance of life in the medium term,
short term,

21
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:18,594
medium term and long term.
And in a social context that works for 

22
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:23,604
the social context.
And it also works for the individual 

23
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:26,004
context.
So you could imagine that that's a 

24
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:27,894
rather,
it's hypothetically possible that 

25
00:01:30,251 --> 00:01:35,251
there's only a certain set of solutions 
to a problem that complex.

26
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,223
And if that's the case,
then that would account for the 

27
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:42,450
emergence of something approximating a 
universal morality.

28
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,820
And it would also explain why every 
possible political system won't work.

29
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,433
So

30
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,213
no,
this is Swanson's map of the 

31
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:57,584
hypothalamus.
Now you'll note that the hypothalamic 

32
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:01,370
structures,
they're the ones with the little circles

33
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,320
and so on,
on the left.

34
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,970
It like every other element of the 
brain.

35
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,900
The hypothalamus isn't a homogenous 
structure,

36
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,660
right?
And generally when you name something,

37
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,860
if you think about it,
the name presumes a homogenous structure

38
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,723
because otherwise you would 
differentiate the name and you would 

39
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:24,110
call it a bunch of names instead of just
one.

40
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:25,730
And so what happens,
for example,

41
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:28,190
that as people learn more about the 
brain,

42
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:29,024
you'll,
you'll notice this as you learn more 

43
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:31,154
about the brain,
you start thinking about it necessarily 

44
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:34,484
as the brain,
which is like a homogenous mass of 

45
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:39,230
neurons.
And you start thinking about it in terms

46
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:40,064
of its functional subsystems.
And then once you learn more about 

47
00:02:42,561 --> 00:02:43,394
those,
you think about those functional 

48
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:47,720
subsystems in terms of their functional 
subsystems.

49
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,110
And you can keep differentiating all the
way down.

50
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:53,600
You can differentiate all the way down 
to the molecular level.

51
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,913
And so as your knowledge improves,
your level of resolution improves and 

52
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:00,640
you can use more and more precise 
terminology.

53
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,200
What you see is that the hypothalamus is
composed of a number of systems.

54
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,843
And one of the things that Swanson has 
done with this particular diagram is 

55
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:13,504
indicate which parts of the hypothalamus
this is in a rat's brain are basically 

56
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:17,794
responsible for reproductive behaviors 
in which are responsible for defensive 

57
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:25,030
behaviors.
And that's part of the hypothalamus.

58
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:26,770
Now the other part,
so,

59
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:27,604
so,
so there's a very archaic system way 

60
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:31,684
down in the bottom of the brain,
older than emotions about his oldest 

61
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,950
pain that's responsible for these very 
fundamental motivational drive.

62
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:39,784
So you can think about the hypothalamus 
if you want to think about this way as 

63
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:46,480
the part of the biological basis of what
Freud would have called the Ed.

64
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,153
No,
we don't have to think about it as in 

65
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:55,300
terms of relatively vague statements 
like the Ed anymore because we know more

66
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,700
about the underlying circuitry and we 
know that it's,

67
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,390
that it's,
um,

68
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,693
quite standard across mammalian species 
and even farther back in the genetic 

69
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:10,070
chain then just mammals.
So yeah.

70
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:16,923
System.

71
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,093
Yeah.
Well,

72
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,503
you know,
systems develop in an evolutionary 

73
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:25,140
chain,
right?

74
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,603
And some systems are more primordial 
than others and so the hypothalamic 

75
00:04:31,141 --> 00:04:31,974
systems are more primordial than the 
hippocampus and the Amygdala acts 

76
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:38,250
systems.
And so pain,

77
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,490
you can think of pain as an emotion.
People usually don't,

78
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:44,460
they usually think about it as an,
as a motivational system.

79
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:47,340
But the distinction between those terms 
is vague.

80
00:04:47,341 --> 00:04:48,174
Anyways,
pain has a emotion like component and a 

81
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,700
motivation like component,
like anger does.

82
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,150
All I mean by older is that it was their
first.

83
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,350
So anxiety for example seems to be an 
elaboration of pain.

84
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,650
So pain,
pain represents pain indicates damage to

85
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:11,310
the system that's being stimulated 
basically.

86
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,144
Something like that.
Well let me get to that because I will 

87
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:20,070
get to that because that's another

88
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,713
reduction

89
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,280
probably for all of them.
Yeah.

90
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,540
Yeah.
So,

91
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,473
so this governs reproductive behavior 
that would be outputs from the 

92
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:37,980
reproductive system to other systems 
that mediate positive emotion,

93
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,330
but they're all too,
so part of the hippocampus,

94
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,580
part of the hypothalamus is devoted to 
these motivation like processes.

95
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,760
I think their motivation like 
personalities and part of it is actually

96
00:05:50,761 --> 00:05:51,840
devoted.
The other part of it,

97
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:52,674
the other half of it is devoted towards 
exploration and the exploration system 

98
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,063
is the source.
The roots of the exploration system in 

99
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:02,630
the hypothalamus are the,
are the,

100
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,823
are the bottom part of the structure 
that produces the kind of positive 

101
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:11,831
emotion that's associated with approach 
and and joy.

102
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,783
So,
and it's also extremely all because it 

103
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:17,840
has its roots in the hypothalamus.
So that's the dopaminergic system.

104
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,570
So half the Hypothalamus,
roughly speaking,

105
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:21,404
is devoted towards the regulation of um,
fundamentally motivated behaviors like 

106
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,973
sexuality and defensive aggression say,
and the other half of it is devoted 

107
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:33,530
towards exploration.

108
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,113
And so that's quite interesting because 
one of the things that means is that 

109
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:38,630
exploration,
that tendency,

110
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:42,170
the proclivity towards exploration is 
also unbelievably archaic.

111
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,730
It's really,
really old.

112
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,700
And as I mentioned,
I think I told you this before,

113
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,720
if you studied the behavior of a 
decorticate cat,

114
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,093
which is a cap that really has almost no
brain left except the hypothalamus and 

115
00:06:56,151 --> 00:07:00,110
the spinal structures,
that cat is hypo exploratory,

116
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,510
hyper exploratory,
sorry.

117
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,583
It explores more than a normal cat,
which is quite strange given that it 

118
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:07,784
doesn't have much of a brain.
But part of the reason it explores more 

119
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,773
is because it can't form the memory 
structures that would inhibit the 

120
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:18,560
exploration has a consequence of 
learning.

121
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,130
So basically what happens is you're 
curious about something until you figure

122
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:22,964
it out.
And then you've built a representation 

123
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:25,844
of it,
which is in some sense a representation 

124
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,600
of what to do around that thing.

125
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,730
And once you've built that 
representation,

126
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:32,803
it's not necessary to be curious about 
that thing anymore because you've 

127
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:35,924
figured it out and you might as well go 
on to some other thing that you don't 

128
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,480
understand.
But if you don't have much of a brain,

129
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,050
you can't store the consequences of your
exploratory activity.

130
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:45,884
And so you can't inhibit it.
So that's why a cat without a brain is 

131
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:49,364
hyper exploratory.
So what I think is really interesting 

132
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:52,964
about the hypothalamic work is that 
we're going to talk a lot about the 

133
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:58,880
representation of exploration in 
mythology.

134
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,373
And it was very interesting to me to 
learn that the proclivity towards 

135
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:05,714
exploration and the positive emotion 
that's associated with that is so 

136
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:11,300
ancient that it's grounded in the 
hypothalamus.

137
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,310
So it's as all so to speak as hunger and
sex knows are very,

138
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:21,311
very old things.
So now you might say,

139
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:23,360
well,
if the hypothalamus can do all this,

140
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:25,010
why do you need the rest of the brain?

141
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,040
And that's a perfectly good question.
Um,

142
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,380
some animals don't have much more brazen
than that.

143
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,233
It seems to me that the reason that you 
need it is because when you have 

144
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:36,524
motivational system a and motivational 
system be in motivational system c and 

145
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:43,670
Motivational System d,
there are conflicts.

146
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:48,380
There are potential conflicts between 
their operations across spans of time.

147
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,143
One can interfere with another,
and the optimal arrangement is so that 

148
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,723
the operations of each of these systems 
is sequenced in such a manner that each 

149
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:02,730
of them get what they need on an ongoing
basis.

150
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,103
And so part of the reason that you need 
the rest of your brain is to do the 

151
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:10,530
proper sequencing is to figure out when 
you should do what.

152
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:14,460
And so the rest of the brain and part is
there to take time into account.

153
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:16,530
But it's not only there to take time 
into account,

154
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,920
it's also there to take context into 
account because reproductive behavior,

155
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,970
for example,
has to be context sensitive.

156
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,980
Even though it's a fundamental 
motivation.

157
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,420
It has to be context sensitive because 
every situation is not the same as every

158
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:34,254
other situation,
especially among animals that become 

159
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:39,930
increasingly complex.
So part of the reason that you need more

160
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:43,770
brain or that that it might be 
worthwhile under some conditions to have

161
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:44,604
more brain is to solve the problem of 
how to organize multiple fundamental 

162
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,510
motivational systems working 
simultaneously.

163
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,793
And that's a lot of the problems that 
you're trying to solve on a day to day 

164
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:56,910
basis are precisely that.
You know,

165
00:09:56,911 --> 00:10:01,911
you have to add emotional regulation to 
that and you have to also,

166
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:02,843
because we're social animals,
you have to add the problem of the fact 

167
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:05,964
that there's all sorts of other people 
who are trying to do exactly the same 

168
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:08,724
thing cooperatively and competitively in
the same environment across different 

169
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:13,314
spans of time.
So it's a very complex optimization 

170
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,614
problem.

171
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,440
It doesn't seem like it's precisely 
computable.

172
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,573
A lot of it seems to have to,
a lot of the way we do it seems to have 

173
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:25,860
to do with ongoing negotiation,
you know,

174
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:26,910
because you might say,
well,

175
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,170
what's the answer to the proper 
hierarchical arrangement of motivational

176
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:34,740
necessities?
And I think that the past can offer,

177
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,993
um,
hints in that direction and also can 

178
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,590
probably inform us about what won't 
work.

179
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,783
But those are sort of vague and broad.
And in order to determine how to update 

180
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:48,750
that and bring it into the present,
there has to be continual,

181
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:52,080
ongoing communication and negotiation.
So,

182
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,043
okay.
So then you can think about the 

183
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:59,560
relationship between what we were 
thinking about as the

184
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:03,903
fundamental unit of personality.
Because I think of this not only as the 

185
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:08,314
fundamental unit of narrative,
but the fundamental unit of personality 

186
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,790
is that the,
the basic motivational systems,

187
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:18,320
which I've sort of outlined here,
um,

188
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,833
in schematic format,
I'm not claiming that these are 

189
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:22,834
precisely,
precisely accurate or scientific 

190
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:28,270
categories,
but you can think of them.

191
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,493
The basic motivational states basically 
as associated with self propagation and 

192
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:33,934
self maintenance.
Those are the two big problems that are 

193
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,043
a living creature has to solve.
And then those problems are broken down 

194
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,710
into the operation of more specialized 
subsystems,

195
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,870
like the desire for affiliation,
which is,

196
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:48,940
seems to be a basic motivation among 
people.

197
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,770
Uh,
sexual desire.

198
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:54,250
Those are all proper itself.
Propagation motivations,

199
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,340
thermal regulation,
thirst,

200
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,570
hunger,
elimination,

201
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,110
all the sorts of things that you think 
of as basic biological necessities.

202
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,303
And so each of those has the capacity to
pop up something that's approximating a 

203
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:08,920
personality when it needs to.

204
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,520
And so it's not a drive,
which is an important thing to realize.

205
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:13,354
There's a drive like element to the 
degree that that process has become 

206
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,900
habitual or that it's based in instinct.
So,

207
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:23,830
but so the drive like the more drive 
like something is,

208
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,750
the more likely it is that lower levels 
in the nervous system are taking care of

209
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:32,200
it.
And so maybe spinal systems for example.

210
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,240
So you know,
if you put your hand on a hot stove,

211
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:37,510
you'll jerk it back fast before you feel
the pain.

212
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:38,883
And that's because there's a reflex loop
between your sensory receptors on your 

213
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:45,730
hand and your spinal cord.
It's very fast.

214
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:46,564
It just goes like that.
It's a sensory motor loop and it's 

215
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:53,290
basically deterministic.
So things that extremely high resolution

216
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:58,291
are becoming increasingly deterministic.
So the pain comes in after you've pulled

217
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:02,350
your hand away and that seems to be 
something like it's teaching you in some

218
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:03,820
sense your body is teaching you.

219
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,150
That's one way of thinking about it,
not to do that stupid thing again.

220
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,373
And are they.
People also think maybe that pain 

221
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:10,624
immobilizes us so that we're more likely
to heal and or less likely to keep 

222
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:17,140
engaging in the behavior that caused the
damage.

223
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,740
So,
all right,

224
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:21,574
so our motivational systems are popping 
up these little personalities all the 

225
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:26,561
time.
And you know,

226
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:27,394
one of the dictums of psychoanalytic 
thought is that those little 

227
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:29,974
motivational personalities can more or 
less have a life of their own because 

228
00:13:32,831 --> 00:13:35,200
they're there,
there are subsets of you,

229
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,410
and if they're not integrated into the 
complete personality,

230
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:39,244
well then when they emerge,
they're going to be rather primordial 

231
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:45,010
and unsophisticated.
And you see this in people,

232
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:47,050
for example,
who have outbursts of anger.

233
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,610
You know,
it's that it isn't exactly reasonable to

234
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:52,444
say that they've become disinhibited.
Although that's one way of thinking 

235
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:55,960
about it.

236
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,793
It's actually more reasonable to assume 
that they haven't developed enough 

237
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:04,400
sophistication to integrate that 
motivational system.

238
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:06,520
So that capacity for anger,
for example,

239
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,503
into their personality as a whole.
And one of the dictums of Humean 

240
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,484
psychotherapy in particular is that it's
are extraordinarily useful to integrate 

241
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:20,620
those elements of your personality that 
might have like a fiery liked nature,

242
00:14:20,621 --> 00:14:21,454
a potentially dangerous nature.
Anger and aggression is a really good 

243
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:25,084
example of that.
But sexual desire is also a really good 

244
00:14:27,671 --> 00:14:30,070
example of that.
If you're sophisticated,

245
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,610
you have that system at hand when you 
need it,

246
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,493
but you don't use it in a manner that's 
destructive to your operations as a 

247
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:41,884
whole across time.
And you don't use it in a manner that 

248
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:45,274
dis dis disrupts the relationship that 
you've established socially with your 

249
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:52,100
family and broader society.
So it's all integrated.

250
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,780
It's like it's integrated into a game.

251
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,613
And one of the things you might think 
about is that a lot of the games that 

252
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:01,850
people do play and that people like to 
watch our games of aggression,

253
00:15:01,851 --> 00:15:03,560
integration,
you know,

254
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:06,410
so football is a really good example of 
that.

255
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:07,244
I mean,
those guys are massive and they're 

256
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:10,640
strong and they're aggressive.
But you know,

257
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:12,320
by,
and by and large,

258
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:17,300
when they're in the football game,
they use that to further the game.

259
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,420
Now they're trying to win individually 
and their treat teams trying to win.

260
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:21,254
But at the same time,
both teams are competing within a 

261
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:24,134
framework of rules.
And that's in a broader framework that 

262
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:27,434
encompasses the entire audience,
which is also continually giving them 

263
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:32,570
feedback on the quality of their play.
You know?

264
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:36,050
So if somebody does something 
particularly brutal and unnecessary,

265
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,300
the whole audience is going to complain 
about that,

266
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,130
you know?
And that's,

267
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,053
that's one of the ways by which the 
players determine how much force can be 

268
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:48,440
used and how much force can't be used.
Because as the,

269
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:49,274
as the game continues,
it's not easy to tell when you're being 

270
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:55,550
too aggressive or not too aggressive.
You know?

271
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:56,384
So

272
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,313
it's funny,
I was reading a little while ago about 

273
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:01,923
the Canada,
Russia Harkey series in 1972 and if I 

274
00:16:04,781 --> 00:16:07,720
remember correctly,
the Canadians played by European rules,

275
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:09,460
which meant that there was no body 
checking.

276
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,430
So that was kind of hard on them because
the Europeans don't check.

277
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:17,200
But the Canadians claimed that in games 
they played where there was no checking,

278
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:18,034
there was a lot more hitting with the 
ends of sticks and a lot more slashing 

279
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,604
and like there were,
there were still all sorts of 

280
00:16:23,231 --> 00:16:24,064
aggression,
but it was ne never able to get up to 

281
00:16:25,991 --> 00:16:28,750
the point where you could give someone a
solid hit.

282
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:29,584
And the Canadians take on that was that 
the game wasn't necessarily less 

283
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,580
dangerous or less rough without 
checking.

284
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,400
It's just at the aggression got 
subordinated.

285
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:41,140
And so you know,
it's,

286
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:41,974
it's,
it's not an easy thing to figure out 

287
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:48,760
exactly what level of force is necessary
to push any given thing forward.

288
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,240
But none is definitely the wrong answer.
You know,

289
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:57,100
and if you're ever involved,
which you will be an oh no doubt are now

290
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,520
if you're involved in difficult 
negotiations as you move forward,

291
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,354
salary negotiations or negotiations 
about a given project or even even 

292
00:17:06,221 --> 00:17:11,221
complaints that even attempts on your 
part to solve problems at work,

293
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:14,830
like being subject to,
you know,

294
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:15,664
to arbitrary tyranny or being bored to 
death by a useless project or something 

295
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:20,074
like that.
If you don't have that capacity for 

296
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:25,720
force at hand,
you're not going to win.

297
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,410
You're not going to win,
you're just going to get walked over and

298
00:17:29,411 --> 00:17:30,790
how much force you need.

299
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,130
That's part of the ongoing dialogue.
And so,

300
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,433
and that's really worth thinking about a
lot of what happens in psychotherapy as 

301
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:42,494
well as exposure to things that are,
that people are afraid of and the 

302
00:17:46,371 --> 00:17:49,560
development of new micro skills.
So for example,

303
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,813
sorry,
I have a client who isn't very socially 

304
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:54,060
skilled.
You know,

305
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:54,894
we might practice things like shaky 
hands and telling each other who we are 

306
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,620
because if you don't have that down as a
routine,

307
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,250
it's difficult to make a foray into a 
broader social environment.

308
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,084
So sometimes people are stopped socially
because they lock micro skills and 

309
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:12,930
sometimes it's because they're afraid 
and those two things interplay.

310
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,183
But another thing that happens in 
therapy and awful lot is that people 

311
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:17,334
come in for assertiveness training.
You know when there are people who've 

312
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:21,354
usually,
they're usually agreeable in 

313
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:23,064
temperament,
but there are also people who have 

314
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,533
failed to integrate that capacity for 
aggression into their personality for 

315
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:31,500
one reason or another.

316
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,440
Maybe they weren't taught to.
That's certainly possible.

317
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,770
Maybe when they manifested aggression,
they were punished for it.

318
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:38,963
Maybe they observed other people who 
were too aggressive and decided that 

319
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:45,210
they were never going to be like that.
That's a common response,

320
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,253
but it doesn't,
it doesn't really matter because once 

321
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:51,210
you're an adult and you're working in a 
competitive world,

322
00:18:51,211 --> 00:18:52,044
which you will definitely be,
you have to have that capacity because 

323
00:18:56,281 --> 00:19:00,120
otherwise you get pushed to the bottom 
of the dominance hierarchy and exploited

324
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,523
and so,
and it's not necessarily because of 

325
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:06,120
malevolence.
Partly it can be that,

326
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:06,954
but often it's just,
it's the consequence of the fact that 

327
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,360
generally if you're negotiating for 
something,

328
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,433
there are forces pulling on that from 
all directions and the out the obvious 

329
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,200
what outcome is obviously.
Right.

330
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,034
It's not obvious at all.
And so it's a matter of negotiation and 

331
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:26,880
so you have to be able to put your 
position forward with some force and not

332
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:27,714
be timid about it and be articulate 
about it and all that is a consequence 

333
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:31,584
of integrating these systems that can be
very dangerous if they're not working 

334
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:36,504
properly into your personality rather 
than ignoring them and letting them run 

335
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:43,350
in an underground fashion,
which is what they would do.

336
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,213
Yes.

337
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,630
Yeah.
Well the thing about Freud,

338
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,663
this is what the comment was,
that it's reminiscent of Friday and 

339
00:19:53,261 --> 00:19:54,094
sublimation.
Freud more or less had an inhibitory 

340
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,740
mortal of socialization,
you know,

341
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:00,574
because he thought of people as pushed 
by the Ed so that the ego has pushed by 

342
00:20:04,451 --> 00:20:05,284
the head and inhibited by the superego.
And there's some truth in that to the 

343
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:10,774
degree that that you're subject to quasi
tyrannical pressure by a society that 

344
00:20:15,671 --> 00:20:16,504
isn't well integrated.
A lot of what's going to happen to you 

345
00:20:20,591 --> 00:20:21,424
is don't do that.
And the capacity to not do something 

346
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:26,044
that you're motivated to do,
like an impulsive thing is obviously 

347
00:20:28,781 --> 00:20:29,614
necessary.
But sublimation in a sense is the basis 

348
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:35,224
of Piagetian theory.
And Piaget's alternative to Friday and 

349
00:20:39,851 --> 00:20:44,230
thinking is that it's not inhibitory.
Especially not if it's,

350
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,900
if your personality is properly 
integrated,

351
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,500
what it is instead is integration into a
game like structure.

352
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,333
We're going to talk more about that.
So the point is is that you're starting 

353
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:56,560
at high levels of resolution with your 
body,

354
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,830
you know,
and you're building these structures out

355
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:00,664
of your capacity to move and at your 
capacity to perceive and these 

356
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:05,170
motivational systems that are driving 
you.

357
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,483
And as you become socialized and as you 
bring more and more people into the 

358
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:13,450
conversation,
the hierarchy gets more and more complex

359
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:17,230
and sophisticated and then it's the 
whole thing that's regulating.

360
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:19,390
It's not inhibitory,
you know?

361
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:21,610
So you don't want to inhibit your 
aggression.

362
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:22,444
You want to harness it so it serves the 
purposes of the greater the individual 

363
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:28,480
and the greater good.
If you can figure out how to do that,

364
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,540
it's better that way because you have 
more power now.

365
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,110
It might be better for you to be 
cowardly and,

366
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,123
and retreating if the alternative is to 
be impulsively aggressive and 

367
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:39,664
destructive.
But that's not nearly as good as having 

368
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:43,144
the capacity for aggression at your hand
and being able to use it in a 

369
00:21:45,731 --> 00:21:47,830
sophisticated manner.
So,

370
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,423
all right,
so this is a way of thinking about how 

371
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:52,924
things,
yes.

372
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,913
Okay.

373
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,540
I don't think it's,
I don't think you can say that it's that

374
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,780
simple.
I mean I think that happens,

375
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,970
but how it happens,
we don't know.

376
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:22,950
And the thing too is that this 
organization does not only take place in

377
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:23,784
your brain.
That's another thing that the 

378
00:22:25,231 --> 00:22:26,064
psychoanalysts I think over estimated 
because they tend to think of psychic 

379
00:22:30,331 --> 00:22:34,560
regulation as internal,
but it's not.

380
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,394
So for example,
as long as you're acceptable to your 

381
00:22:39,451 --> 00:22:40,284
peers,
you seldom have to regulate your own 

382
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:46,290
behavior because they'll regulate it for
you.

383
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,230
Right?
And so when you're out in the world,

384
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,650
I mean you guys are all sitting there in
a particular way,

385
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:56,730
partly because if you deviated from the 
appropriate way to sit there,

386
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,450
whatever that is,
if you deviated from that sufficiently,

387
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,493
the group would turn on you right away.
So as long as you're awake enough to 

388
00:23:05,281 --> 00:23:08,220
respond to the subtle cues that people 
are giving you,

389
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,210
you don't even have to worry about the 
internal inhibitory problem.

390
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,433
Now what you want is you want your 
nervous system is organized in a way so 

391
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:21,480
that it fits well into the overall 
organization of the society.

392
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,940
And there has to be cross talk between 
notes.

393
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,880
But Society exists,
right?

394
00:23:26,881 --> 00:23:30,420
So anything society will do to regulate 
you,

395
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,720
you don't have to do.
And that's really useful.

396
00:23:33,721 --> 00:23:36,000
It's an outsourcing problem,
you know,

397
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:37,800
and there's lots of things you 
outsource.

398
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:41,340
So one of the things is think about 
something like self esteem.

399
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,053
Self esteem is a very,
I don't like the word because self 

400
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:49,850
esteem is really something like 
extroversion minus neuroticism.

401
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,020
It's,
it's close to that.

402
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,510
But let's,
let's,

403
00:23:52,511 --> 00:23:54,530
so let's look at it in a slightly 
different way.

404
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:55,364
Let's say,
well how valuable should you regard 

405
00:23:57,441 --> 00:23:59,840
yourself?
And so then you think,

406
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:02,480
well that,
so and then we might think,

407
00:24:02,481 --> 00:24:04,880
well maybe that has something to do with
competence.

408
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:05,991
Okay,
well,

409
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:08,480
so how competent are you?
Well,

410
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,373
the answer to that is you really don't 
know and there's actually no way of 

411
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:14,120
telling.
So your nervous system has to guess.

412
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:14,954
And the way it does that is that first 
you're put on a normal distribution for 

413
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:21,320
negative emotion and that you're just 
sort of given that at birth.

414
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:25,490
That's your temperament.
And then the socialization can pull that

415
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,280
one way or another.
I know it can,

416
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,473
it can make you more stable or less 
stable depending on how you interact 

417
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:33,314
with your parents and the immediate 
environment and how dangerous the 

418
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:35,984
environment is.
And then the next thing you do is you 

419
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:39,614
observe yourself operating in the world 
and you see how good you are at solving 

420
00:24:43,341 --> 00:24:44,174
problems and that adjusts it.
And then everyone else is broadcasting 

421
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,630
to you all the time what your 
comparative value is.

422
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,213
And so that's,
that's really how you establish an 

423
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,970
estimate of your competence.

424
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,193
And it's almost always comparative 
competence because the question in most 

425
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:02,330
groups isn't,
can you do something?

426
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,880
It is,
but the real question is,

427
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,103
can you do something as well or better 
than anyone else in this particular 

428
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:12,680
group?
Because there's no absolute standard for

429
00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:14,870
being,
being able to do things precisely.

430
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,763
You know,
everyone is insufficient when you think 

431
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:21,170
of the,
the ultimate task,

432
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,210
right?
Because people's knowledge have limits.

433
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,790
So the question is,
well,

434
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,690
are you up for the challenge compared to
the people around you?

435
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,583
So it's,
it's a very complex calibration process 

436
00:25:32,451 --> 00:25:34,520
and it certainly doesn't all take place 
inside.

437
00:25:34,521 --> 00:25:35,750
It can't,
you're not,

438
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,990
you're not complex enough to do that.
And it's foolish anyways,

439
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:42,140
you know,
partly what the stock market does.

440
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,250
The stock market has a massive 
conversation about the relative value of

441
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,930
property.
Roughly speaking and it it,

442
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,003
it,
it moves around a lot because you think 

443
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,230
about all the variables that are 
beating,

444
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:55,064
taking into account at the same time,
it's not only every company and every 

445
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:03,290
commodity in relationship to every other
company in every other commodity.

446
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,180
It's also all that in relationship to 
the price of all the currencies and that

447
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:09,014
takes into account political stability 
or instability in disease and 

448
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:17,500
catastrophe and hurricanes and so on and
so forth like that has,

449
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,373
there has to be something dynamic and 
ongoing that enables those calculations 

450
00:26:22,071 --> 00:26:25,700
to be made because there it's 
incalculable otherwise,

451
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,570
and the same thing is true in some sense
of your competence.

452
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,613
You can't calculate that on your own.
You have to have help and so that's 

453
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:37,820
partly why the group also decides where 
you are in the dominance hierarchy.

454
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,410
Now the group could also under or 
overshoot that happens lots of times,

455
00:26:42,411 --> 00:26:45,750
you know,
because maybe the local environment that

456
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:46,584
you're in isn't a very good 
representative of the broader 

457
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:49,794
environment.
This happens to lots of smart people in 

458
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:52,950
high school,
for example,

459
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:56,940
or junior high where if they're 
intelligent,

460
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:02,670
that is not necessarily socially 
valuable for a number of years.

461
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:06,990
And if the person who's intelligent 
doesn't get out of that environment into

462
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:09,510
an environment where intelligence is 
valued.

463
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:13,530
So hopefully that's a university,
then you know their,

464
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,364
their actual potential isn't going to be
valued by the dominance hierarchy in 

465
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:21,990
proper keeping with its,
with its actual re real world value.

466
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,090
So anyways,
okay.

467
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:29,040
So the issue is,
and this is the ethical issue is this is

468
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:29,874
the ethical issue is how do you 
hierarchically organize these 

469
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,180
subpersonalities because you might 
think,

470
00:27:36,181 --> 00:27:38,910
well why do you have to hierarchically 
organize them to begin with?

471
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,360
Now there's an element here for the 
postmodernists you can think of of this.

472
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:49,791
So 130 years ago,
Nietzsche announced that God was dead,

473
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,593
right?
And so that was a rep that was a 

474
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:53,304
reflection of the collapse in some sense
of the believability of traditional 

475
00:27:56,431 --> 00:27:57,264
religions.
And you can think of traditional 

476
00:27:58,681 --> 00:28:02,280
religions as a coherent overarching 
narrative.

477
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,323
Now,
you might argue about how coherent 

478
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:06,240
coherent it is,
but they're pretty coherent.

479
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,940
That doesn't necessarily mean that 
they're accurate,

480
00:28:08,941 --> 00:28:09,774
but they're pretty coherent.
So the slats were pulled out from 

481
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:13,644
underneath those structures.
Now what happened during the 20th 

482
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:18,564
century was two things and one was some 
of those religious narratives were 

483
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:26,490
replaced by ideological narratives and 
that turned out to be a really bad idea.

484
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,630
And so that was one stream of thought in
some sense stemming from Nietzsche,

485
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:31,464
or at least from his observation,
there was another stream of thought 

486
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:33,834
which basically said if religious 
structures have collapsed and they had 

487
00:28:39,181 --> 00:28:40,014
two,
that means all grand narratives have 

488
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:44,760
collapsed.
And that's really a postmodernist claim.

489
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:50,150
But the problem with that claim is you 
can't act unless you have a hierarchy of

490
00:28:50,491 --> 00:28:53,520
values because you can't figure out what
to do next.

491
00:28:53,521 --> 00:28:54,354
Also,
you can't even figure out if you should 

492
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:56,064
do anything,
but you certainly can't figure out what 

493
00:28:57,931 --> 00:29:01,770
to do next because in order to organize 
your behavior and move forward,

494
00:29:01,771 --> 00:29:05,910
you have to say that one thing is more 
important than many other things,

495
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:06,300
right?

496
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,280
Every time you act,
you're making that decision.

497
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:09,570
Now you might say,
well,

498
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:12,090
you can only make that decision at a 
micro level,

499
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,350
like what's best now.
But people who do that are impulsive.

500
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,213
That's how we define them.
And that doesn't work out well across 

501
00:29:20,311 --> 00:29:21,144
time.
You know what they're doing is 

502
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:25,140
responding to,
um,

503
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,950
in some sense,
instinctual whims moment by moment,

504
00:29:28,951 --> 00:29:32,250
that doesn't seem very sophisticated.
You don't want someone round like that.

505
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,870
You can't predict what they're going to 
do.

506
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,390
You can't cooperate with them,
they can't follow rules.

507
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:39,270
You can't have a project with them,
you can't trust them.

508
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,313
It's like that isn't going to.
And so the idea that grand narratives 

509
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:45,814
are obsolete is it's based on a 
misunderstanding of exactly what the 

510
00:29:52,911 --> 00:29:53,744
narratives are.
And it's also based on absence of 

511
00:29:56,781 --> 00:29:57,614
realization that a narrative is 
primarily something you act out before 

512
00:30:01,491 --> 00:30:04,760
you represent.
So a narrative can be latent.

513
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,700
So let me give you an example of that.
So

514
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,380
I thought it puzzled about this for a 
long time.

515
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,500
I'd say you go out and watch a 
chimpanzee troop.

516
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,053
Now we know of the chimps are organized 
in a dominance hierarchy and we know 

517
00:30:21,051 --> 00:30:24,830
that the dominance hierarchy among 
chimps is male dominated.

518
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,660
The females have a dormant,
it's hierarchy too,

519
00:30:26,661 --> 00:30:29,150
but the fundamental dominant Turkey's 
male dominated.

520
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,000
It's not like that so much with barnum 
bolts by the way,

521
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,893
which are very much like chips.
But so you can watch the chimps and you 

522
00:30:37,491 --> 00:30:38,324
can see that chimp a knows the chimp B 
is higher up in the dominance hierarchy 

523
00:30:41,451 --> 00:30:45,590
and Chimp d knows the C is higher up in 
the dominance hierarchy and you can even

524
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:46,424
see that the offspring,
like if you have a high dominant female 

525
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:52,370
and she has offspring,
all the other chimps know that you don't

526
00:30:52,371 --> 00:30:55,190
mess around with her offspring because 
she's a dominant female.

527
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,670
So that the,
the mapping of the dominance hierarchy,

528
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,690
the mapping is quite sophisticated.
So then you might say,

529
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:07,550
well the chimps are following rules so,
but then you think,

530
00:31:07,551 --> 00:31:08,384
well no they're not because they don't,
they don't actually know rules because 

531
00:31:10,581 --> 00:31:11,414
while it,
cause you got to ask what exactly is a 

532
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:13,160
rule,
right?

533
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,700
Oh well that's a good question.
Like a rule seems to be the articulation

534
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:20,443
of a principal,
but it seems to be something that you 

535
00:31:22,701 --> 00:31:24,110
have to represent.
Like you say,

536
00:31:24,111 --> 00:31:24,944
well,
a rule is chimp be always submits to 

537
00:31:28,551 --> 00:31:29,384
chimp.
A,

538
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,463
that's the rule that the is following,
but the chip isn't following rules 

539
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,333
because the chimp doesn't have rules,
but there's regularities there and so 

540
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,830
what?
Those really are a behavioral patterns.

541
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,560
They're not rules.
Now,

542
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:47,060
understanding that is extremely useful 
because what you can understand is that

543
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:49,703
regularities in complex social behavior 
can emerge in the absence of any 

544
00:31:54,421 --> 00:31:55,254
conscious representation,
any consciously articulated 

545
00:31:57,931 --> 00:32:00,780
representation of those rules.
Because you might ask,

546
00:32:00,781 --> 00:32:01,614
well,
where do moral presuppositions come 

547
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,550
from?
Assuming that,

548
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:07,320
say religious systems,
for example,

549
00:32:07,321 --> 00:32:08,154
are concerned with moral presuppositions
and that social systems are concerned 

550
00:32:11,551 --> 00:32:13,440
with those two,
where do they come from?

551
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,270
Well,
there's lots of theories about that,

552
00:32:15,271 --> 00:32:16,680
right?
The Marxists would say,

553
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,813
well,
it's all about exploitation and an 

554
00:32:19,811 --> 00:32:20,644
economic advantage,
and a postmodernist would say it's all 

555
00:32:23,311 --> 00:32:26,790
about exclusion and power because 
they're sort of quasi Marxist sorted.

556
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,320
They're quasi marxists.
Anyways,

557
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,890
there's always this there and,
and you know what Karl Marx,

558
00:32:31,891 --> 00:32:32,724
for Karl Marx,
religion was the opiate of the people 

559
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:38,700
and he thought about it as a structure 
that it emerged because the power elites

560
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:41,030
wanted to dominate the,
the,

561
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,953
you know,
the,

562
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,070
the people who weren't empowered to 
extract out value from them.

563
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,903
And it's like there's no doubt that 
there can be an element of exploitation 

564
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,060
in any social system.
And there's no doubt that social systems

565
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:53,894
are hierarchical so that there are 
people on the top and people on the 

566
00:32:56,661 --> 00:32:59,360
bottom.
But in human society,

567
00:32:59,361 --> 00:33:02,240
there's lots of dominance hierarchies.
There's not just one.

568
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,000
And we value lots of different things 
from people.

569
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,073
And it's by no means obvious that the 
dominance hierarchies were set up 

570
00:33:08,871 --> 00:33:09,704
consciously through conscious thought by
any group of people over any span of 

571
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:14,744
time for any purpose whatsoever.
It's particularly obvious when you also 

572
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:18,734
understand that while we are not the 
only things that have dominance 

573
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:23,000
hierarchies,
chimps have them,

574
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,700
wolves have them.
That's why you can have a pet dog.

575
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,563
You understand the dog,
you know it doesn't even want to be the 

576
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,940
boss in the house.
That's a nervous and upset dog.

577
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:37,120
It wants to have its position as a 
valued low level entity in the dominance

578
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:38,060
hierarchy.

579
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,760
And a dog is just absolutely happy when 
that happens.

580
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,103
So you know,
cause what is the dog gonna do buy 

581
00:33:43,611 --> 00:33:45,530
groceries?
It's like no it's not.

582
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:46,364
So it has to be low in the,
in the dominance hierarchy because it 

583
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:51,320
doesn't have the competence.
And one of the things that's very,

584
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:52,154
very bizarre about Marxist and 
postmodernist thinking is that there 

585
00:33:55,731 --> 00:33:56,564
doesn't seem to be any recognition that 
dominance hierarchies are often 

586
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:03,950
structured based on competence.
No one on like arbitrary distribution of

587
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:04,784
power.
I mean if you want to go have your 

588
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,510
appendix out,
what are you going to look for?

589
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:10,483
Are you going to look for the most 
powerful doctor or you can look for the 

590
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:13,424
most competent doctor.
Well you hope that there's a rough 

591
00:34:15,771 --> 00:34:18,470
relationship between power and status 
and competence,

592
00:34:18,471 --> 00:34:19,304
right?
Because otherwise how are you going to 

593
00:34:19,821 --> 00:34:22,460
figure it out?
But if it's a good hierarchy,

594
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:25,490
it's based on competence,
not on arbitrary power.

595
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,863
So we might say that when a dominance 
hierarchy starts to be based on 

596
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:30,254
arbitrary power or purely on economics 
on economic terms than it's actually 

597
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:35,114
turned into a tyranny.
It's no longer a functional heart 

598
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:41,330
hierarchy.
It's already stultified and twisted into

599
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:42,164
a form that can't be sustained.
And then people are going to get upset 

600
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:47,270
about that and start talking about it.
Or or worse,

601
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:49,490
they're going to start doing things that
are quite disrupted.

602
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:55,090
But the idea that the hierarchical 
structure per se is pathological or that

603
00:34:55,701 --> 00:35:00,701
it's consciously imposed or that it's 
not necessary or that it has,

604
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,680
it has nothing to do with competence.
It's like,

605
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,503
no,
that's just that better not be the case 

606
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,300
because we would be in serious trouble 
if it was the case.

607
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:16,690
So I would say the more,
the more functional the society,

608
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,643
the more the,
the power hierarchy is based on 

609
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:24,830
competence in relationship to what the 
society deems is actually valuable.

610
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,993
Now in not,
obviously no society meets those 

611
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:30,860
criteria perfectly because you can't,
it's,

612
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:35,510
it's part of a dialogue and a continual 
processing of information,

613
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,373
you know,
so you can't hit the target always 

614
00:35:37,651 --> 00:35:38,484
moving,
but you can hope that the dialogue 

615
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,330
continues.
So here's,

616
00:35:42,331 --> 00:35:45,180
here's a little vision I had of how 
things work,

617
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:46,014
like a democratic society works okay,
because people often think if they're 

618
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:51,060
conservative,
orderly,

619
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,953
low and openness,
then they think the conservatives are 

620
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:56,130
right.
And if they're more on the liberal or on

621
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:58,020
the left side,
high in openness,

622
00:35:58,021 --> 00:35:58,854
low and orderliness,
than they think that the left is 

623
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,460
correct.
But,

624
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:05,190
but the left and the right aren't 
correct.

625
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,473
They represent different systems of 
values and the values that they 

626
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:12,780
represent are valid sometimes in some 
situations.

627
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,520
And then the question is,
well,

628
00:36:14,521 --> 00:36:15,354
when and in what situations?
And the answer to that is not only did 

629
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,360
not know,
you can't tell.

630
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,230
And so it's like this.
So imagine that people are on a cliff.

631
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:29,610
It's like they're on a flat plateau and 
it's a cliff on both sides.

632
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:32,520
And down at the bottom of the cliff is 
fire and rocks.

633
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,743
And so you want to stay on top of that 
cliff and it's quite narrow and there's 

634
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:39,870
a line you should walk down right down 
the middle,

635
00:36:39,871 --> 00:36:42,240
but you can't tell where it is.
So what do you do?

636
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,103
You put all the left these here and you 
put all the right wingers here and you 

637
00:36:45,841 --> 00:36:46,674
put a rope between them and you tie the 
rope to you and the right pull this way 

638
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:53,610
in the left poles that way.
And if they're pulling properly,

639
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:54,743
then you can walk right down the middle.
But the only way they can pull property 

640
00:36:57,991 --> 00:37:00,960
is if they keep talking to one another,
you know?

641
00:37:00,961 --> 00:37:02,670
And if,
if the left disappears,

642
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:04,560
then the right pulls everything over the
cliff,

643
00:37:04,561 --> 00:37:07,980
down into the flaming rocks.
And if the left disappears,

644
00:37:07,981 --> 00:37:10,290
then the right pulls everything off the 
cliff,

645
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:12,870
down onto the rocks.
And we know that.

646
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,240
We know that.
And there's been good personality models

647
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:18,210
developed recently.
They're not public yet precisely.

648
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:22,350
That show that if you push a virtue to 
its extreme,

649
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,573
it turns into a vice and that all the 
vices that basically ended up in the 

650
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:28,140
same place.
Yes.

651
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,073
What would you say happens if both sides
are talking a lot but not to one 

652
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:34,123
another?
Like if there's a lot of preaching to 

653
00:37:35,511 --> 00:37:36,344
the choir.

654
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,930
Well its dysfunction.
It's dysfunction

655
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,003
because I was thinking about modern 
American politics where they can 

656
00:37:42,161 --> 00:37:44,800
actually show with data that it's 
increasingly polarized,

657
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,410
like just increasingly left and right 
and subcultures.

658
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,350
Well what what it means.
What that means is that people can't get

659
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:54,510
along.
That's what it means.

660
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,100
And you know,
you can say,

661
00:37:56,101 --> 00:38:00,090
well part of getting along is following 
a shared set of rules and that's true.

662
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:01,920
But the rules are kind of low 
resolution.

663
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,920
But to get along like you think about 
your family,

664
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,683
if your family is structured so that 
it's just a bunch of rules and you 

665
00:38:09,271 --> 00:38:11,340
better damn follow them or there'll be 
punishment,

666
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,190
you know that can be better than just 
sheer chaos,

667
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,503
but it's not as good as general 
principles encompassing continual 

668
00:38:19,261 --> 00:38:21,870
dialogue that works best.
And you know,

669
00:38:21,871 --> 00:38:24,030
you might think,
well what are the general principles and

670
00:38:24,031 --> 00:38:24,864
what we'd hope our,
well we can look at what people have 

671
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:27,594
done in the past and we can look at our 
history and our culture and we can 

672
00:38:30,451 --> 00:38:31,284
think,
okay,

673
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:32,903
we're going to try to,
we're going to try not to do the things 

674
00:38:35,621 --> 00:38:38,710
that people have done in the past that 
are evidently stupid.

675
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:42,130
Like maybe Nazi-ism isn't the way to go 
for example.

676
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:45,130
So we're going to see not what we're 
going to try not to do that.

677
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,230
We can extract out those general 
principles,

678
00:38:47,231 --> 00:38:48,064
but then we have to talk continually in 
the present because the present keeps 

679
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:51,664
moving around.
There's no way of mapping it using a 

680
00:38:54,221 --> 00:38:56,560
structure from the past.
You can only approximate,

681
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,043
you know,
it's like,

682
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,313
you know,
if you took up a google map of Toronto 

683
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:04,660
from 10 years ago and you said,
well this is the map,

684
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:05,494
it's not going to be updated.
It's like you'd have a real rough time 

685
00:39:08,231 --> 00:39:11,290
driving around the waterfront cause 
you'd keep running into skyscrapers that

686
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,030
you know,
aren't supposed to be there.

687
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,730
And so there's,
the map is obviously useful,

688
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:19,180
but the update process is also 
unbelievably useful.

689
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,090
And you can also say,
if you look at left and right,

690
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,253
you can roughly say that the left is on 
the side of update and the right is on 

691
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:29,290
the side of structure.

692
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:30,603
And you might say,
well how much update and how much 

693
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:36,430
structure?
It's like enough to solve the problem.

694
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,070
That's the answer.
What's the problem?

695
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,290
Keeps changing.
How do we keep up,

696
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,183
we talk.
And part of that also is like if you're 

697
00:39:44,171 --> 00:39:45,004
talking,
most of you guys are lefties because 

698
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:49,030
most of you are open and not very 
orderly.

699
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,040
Now there is going to be exceptions in 
here,

700
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:51,874
but,
and you're young because youth is often 

701
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,063
associated with,
with political beliefs that are more in 

702
00:39:55,691 --> 00:39:56,524
the left.
And I think that's because you're in a 

703
00:39:57,641 --> 00:40:00,490
more plastic state of,
of development,

704
00:40:00,491 --> 00:40:01,324
right?
There's still a lot of things open to 

705
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:04,060
you.
So,

706
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:09,330
but the thing about it is that you have 
to get along with the right.

707
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,110
And that's partly because the right 
represents what's already there.

708
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,180
So how do you do that?
Well,

709
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:17,014
that's hard.
But the one thing you definitely do is 

710
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:19,294
listen,
you try to figure out what the hell 

711
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,090
they're up to,
you know,

712
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:26,090
and why and what they stand for and the 
value of that and where it's too extreme

713
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,640
and it's not easy.

714
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,310
But that's,
that's why a democracy is a dialogue and

715
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:31,144
not,
that's how it regulates itself is 

716
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:34,030
through the dialogue.
Okay.

717
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:39,031
So what you're basically trying to do is
or integrate your abilities,

718
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,453
your sub personalities,
which is how I'm going to represented 

719
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,553
into a functional hierarchy.
And a functional hierarchy is one where 

720
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,740
the subsidiary parts of the hierarchy 
don't conflict.

721
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:59,490
So let me give you an example.
You can tell me what I based this on the

722
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:02,410
Piagetian notion of the equilla braided 
state.

723
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,503
So Piaget had this idea that there's two
ways you might be able to run an 

724
00:41:09,671 --> 00:41:10,504
organization.
So say you're moving towards a 

725
00:41:12,071 --> 00:41:12,904
collectively defined goal and one would 
be to put someone at the top of it and 

726
00:41:16,211 --> 00:41:19,060
kind of give them complete control,
tyrannical power.

727
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:23,470
And so that meant you were going to do 
what that person said or else.

728
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,730
Okay.
Now,

729
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:25,564
the problem with that is that that 
person isn't always going to be right 

730
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:31,600
and that you're not always going to be 
happy about doing what they say.

731
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:32,703
And that the fact that you're not happy 
means you're not going to be as 

732
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:36,764
productive.
And it also means that the organization 

733
00:41:38,601 --> 00:41:42,350
is going to have to expand quite a lot 
of energy keeping you in line.

734
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,360
Okay?
So here's an alternative.

735
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:47,300
Alternative is,
here's the goal.

736
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,133
Okay,

737
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:53,490
well let's agree on some general 
principles in relationship to the goal.

738
00:41:53,491 --> 00:41:54,324
And then let's negotiate.
So one of the things I did with my kids 

739
00:41:56,821 --> 00:42:01,821
when they were teenagers was,
you know that there's a certain set of

740
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:07,190
procedures that have to be undertaken in
a household in order for that household.

741
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,210
The function,
right?

742
00:42:08,211 --> 00:42:10,610
So roughly speaking,
people need to eat.

743
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,810
It should be clean enough so that 
contamination isn't a problem.

744
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:15,973
It shouldn't be.
It shouldn't be so messy that it's 

745
00:42:17,631 --> 00:42:20,180
impossible to do anything that you want 
to do when house.

746
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:21,290
You know what Cetera,
there's,

747
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,303
there's guidelines that we all basically
implicitly understand that that 

748
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,390
constitute a well regulated familial 
environment.

749
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:32,690
Well.
So then how do you obtain that?

750
00:42:32,691 --> 00:42:37,640
And one of the processes that I put into
place was we would meet and parse up the

751
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:38,474
jobs and come to a solution.
And the rule was you can't leave the 

752
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:43,604
discussion until the solution is found.
You have to accept the solution unless 

753
00:42:47,151 --> 00:42:47,984
you can come up with a better one and 
that will implement it over a period of 

754
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:52,280
time and see how it works.

755
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,473
And that work,
I wouldn't say it worked perfectly 

756
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:55,844
because nothing works perfectly,
but it's a good process because it 

757
00:42:58,821 --> 00:43:01,730
brings everyone into the game.
They get to define the,

758
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:04,670
and they get to define the game.
They get to define the rules,

759
00:43:04,671 --> 00:43:09,671
they get to define the processes by 
which those rules will be enforced.

760
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:13,190
They get to run it as a simulation and 
see how it works.

761
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:16,790
And then at some point later they get to
have another discussion about it.

762
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:18,530
But you don't want to be discussing in 
every,

763
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,060
every,
you know,

764
00:43:20,061 --> 00:43:20,894
every time there's dishes to be done,
you won't want to discuss the entire 

765
00:43:23,121 --> 00:43:25,040
moral substructure of the whole 
household.

766
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,413
You know,
and dishes are a big deal because 

767
00:43:27,951 --> 00:43:32,000
they're part of dishes and cooking are a
big deal because they are part of the,

768
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,290
there's a tremendous conflict in that 
area because of,

769
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:38,660
because of the role

770
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,273
rapid roll transformation that 
characterized men and women's since the 

771
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:46,890
pill was invented.
So it's a place where,

772
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,053
you know,
massive social transformations manifest 

773
00:43:50,551 --> 00:43:55,551
themselves in local landscapes.
And that's also why solving the problems

774
00:43:55,561 --> 00:43:59,550
in your local landscape is also the way 
of solving the big problems.

775
00:43:59,551 --> 00:44:00,384
You know,
it's like who does the dishes when and 

776
00:44:01,771 --> 00:44:04,650
why and what are the rewards and 
punishments associated with that?

777
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:05,663
Solve that.
And you solve like 30% of the tension 

778
00:44:09,181 --> 00:44:11,180
between men and women.
So,

779
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,050
and that means it's really hard to 
solve.

780
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,333
It's not obvious how you do that and how
you do that over the long run and what 

781
00:44:17,341 --> 00:44:19,260
the reward should be and how valuable it
is.

782
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:20,820
So et Cetera,
et cetera.

783
00:44:20,821 --> 00:44:24,150
It takes an awful lot of negotiation.
But if you don't get it right,

784
00:44:24,151 --> 00:44:27,300
then you have a continual war in your 
household and you pay for that.

785
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,280
Because if you're having a war in your 
household,

786
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,860
then you're going to be stressed to 
death and will kill you.

787
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,970
So it's no joke to get these things 
right and when you're doing it,

788
00:44:35,971 --> 00:44:36,804
it's applied philosophy.
It's sophisticated and applied 

789
00:44:39,751 --> 00:44:42,540
philosophy because that's all you have.
If you don't have roles,

790
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:43,913
right roles,
you don't negotiate and that's good 

791
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:49,350
cause you don't know how to negotiate.
No rules.

792
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,480
It's negotiation,
slavery,

793
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:53,250
or tyranny.
Those are your options.

794
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:57,900
So these are very complicated problems.
That's also the why.

795
00:44:57,901 --> 00:44:58,734
When you,
when you work hard to solve them in the 

796
00:45:00,871 --> 00:45:01,704
domain that you have in your hands,
you're also doing the best you can 

797
00:45:04,891 --> 00:45:08,130
possibly do to figure out how that might
scale up on a broader,

798
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:10,350
in a broader way.
Right.

799
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,850
I read a great book once called 
Systematics,

800
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:15,720
written by a guy named John Galt.
It's a really fast,

801
00:45:15,721 --> 00:45:16,770
fantastic book.

802
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:18,270
Yeah,
I know John Galt,

803
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,370
weird enough,
man was actually his name.

804
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,193
John Galt is the name of a fictional 
character in an Ayn rand book and he's 

805
00:45:25,021 --> 00:45:28,620
one person who stops the world because 
for a variety of reasons,

806
00:45:28,621 --> 00:45:31,740
he stops the industrial world because 
he's thinking he's getting exploited.

807
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:36,840
It's had a huge effect on modern 
American monetary policy by the way.

808
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,093
So anyways,
this Guy John Galt has written a whole 

809
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:42,690
bunch of axioms about organizational 
structure,

810
00:45:42,691 --> 00:45:45,630
which are quite brilliant.
And there's a couple I really remembered

811
00:45:45,631 --> 00:45:48,690
in.
One is the organization does not do what

812
00:45:48,691 --> 00:45:51,240
it's name says it does.
I love that one.

813
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,580
It's so smart.
So,

814
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:55,163
and the second one was large functional 
organizations grow out of small 

815
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:04,410
functional organizations.
So if you want to build something big,

816
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,670
you have to start it small and local and
then figure out how to make it scale.

817
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,710
And in some sense that's what you're 
doing,

818
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:11,933
that's what you're doing and your 
relationships with other people and 

819
00:46:13,531 --> 00:46:15,570
that's what you're doing in your 
familial situation.

820
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:17,580
That's what you're doing in your 
intimate relationships.

821
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:20,070
You solve those problems.
You,

822
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:20,933
you develop a template,
like a skilled template of perception 

823
00:46:24,871 --> 00:46:27,960
and action that you can then bring out 
into the broader world.

824
00:46:27,961 --> 00:46:29,850
It's really important.
So,

825
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,990
so partly,
you know,

826
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:34,824
you inherit a hierarchical structure and
you might think about that as whatever 

827
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:38,694
principles bind your culture together.
And then some of that's rigid and 

828
00:46:42,481 --> 00:46:43,314
pathological and half dead and needs to 
be destroyed and re updated and some of 

829
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:49,104
it isn't.
And you have to figure that out by 

830
00:46:50,071 --> 00:46:51,750
negotiation.
And that's hard,

831
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:55,550
but you don't want to blow the whole 
damn thing down in one gasp,

832
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,413
like the bad wolf and the straw house.
It's like then you have nothing to live 

833
00:46:59,131 --> 00:47:01,170
in.
So you want him,

834
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:02,423
you want to make modifications in a 
culturally determined structure with 

835
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:11,190
caution and care because that is all 
that stops you.

836
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:12,083
That's all that protects you from chaos 
apart from your ability to update your 

837
00:47:16,171 --> 00:47:17,004
models.
And you blow that over and you find out 

838
00:47:18,631 --> 00:47:19,464
what's behind it.
And part of what's behind it is the 

839
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:24,330
dragon of chaos and the terrible mother.
It's not good.

840
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,613
You know,
you saw what happened to Iraq when the 

841
00:47:26,731 --> 00:47:29,740
American's knocked over the hierarchy,
right?

842
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:32,290
It wasn't good.
No,

843
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:34,180
it wasn't good before cause it was a 
tyranny.

844
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:37,360
But it's clearly,
it's not obvious that it's better now,

845
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,913
you know,
and it,

846
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:42,400
it's also possible that what's going to 
happen is it's going to be replaced by a

847
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,660
way,
worse tyranny.

848
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:48,550
So northover is structure.
The water comes flooding in.

849
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:52,270
It's just like a dyke or a or a dam.
So,

850
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,200
all right,
so that's your problem.

851
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:56,960
Now,
you know,

852
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,350
I set that up as part of a moral 
hierarchy.

853
00:47:59,351 --> 00:48:02,170
So at the bottom of any process,
you say,

854
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:04,240
well,
maybe you're trying to be a good person.

855
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:05,980
We might,
what might as well assume that.

856
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:07,023
You might say why,
but my answer to that would be because 

857
00:48:10,091 --> 00:48:11,860
it's better than not being a good 
person.

858
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:12,933
You're gonna run into a lot less pain 
and misery and you're going to be a lot 

859
00:48:16,151 --> 00:48:19,420
less destructive and you're going to 
hurt a lot fewer people.

860
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,850
And you might leave everything better 
than you found it.

861
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,193
And that's not so bad.
It's certainly better than doing the 

862
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:26,523
reverse of all of those things.
So unless you think there's something 

863
00:48:29,801 --> 00:48:34,801
particularly positively valuable about 
pain and misery because,

864
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:37,510
and that seems to be,
you could make that case,

865
00:48:37,511 --> 00:48:42,511
but if I put you in pain and misery,
you do everything you could to get out.

866
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,240
So even if you thought that that was a 
reasonable solution,

867
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,433
if I imposed it on you,
you do everything you possibly could to 

868
00:48:49,571 --> 00:48:51,460
escape.
So all that means is that you don't know

869
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,410
what the hell you're talking about.
Okay?

870
00:48:53,411 --> 00:48:54,244
So because what you act out is more 
representative of who you are than what 

871
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:00,124
you say.
Because what the hell do you know about 

872
00:49:01,661 --> 00:49:02,494
yourself?
You have a vague model of who you are 

873
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:08,230
and if vague model of society,
and so you can wrap off some articulated

874
00:49:08,231 --> 00:49:09,064
representations,
but the probability that they're going 

875
00:49:11,021 --> 00:49:13,690
to really map the underlying structure 
is low.

876
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:15,400
So,
okay,

877
00:49:15,401 --> 00:49:17,140
so we'll assume you're going to be a 
good person.

878
00:49:17,141 --> 00:49:17,974
That's what you're striving for.
And then we can decompose that and you 

879
00:49:20,441 --> 00:49:23,170
can decompose it all the way down to 
micro behaviors.

880
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:27,730
And so the issue is you try to build a 
hierarchy at the bottom.

881
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:30,790
It has all your micro behaviors,
you know the things you can do with your

882
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:33,160
hands and your eyes and your mouth and 
your body.

883
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,630
That's the highest resolution level.
And then you're trying to organize those

884
00:49:37,631 --> 00:49:42,631
into higher and higher into more and 
more abstract and powerful structures in

885
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:48,070
some sense that are also homogenous 
inside.

886
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,470
They're not full of internal 
contradictions.

887
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,053
So that's how you establish peace.
It's how you establish psychological 

888
00:49:55,301 --> 00:49:57,820
stability and that's how you establish 
peace.

889
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:00,850
And there has to be negotiations at all 
of those levels.

890
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,133
And roughly speaking,
it's better to negotiate at the low 

891
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:08,050
levels and you can do it,
you know?

892
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:12,220
So I use this example fairly frequently.
It's like,

893
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,910
so you've got a four year old kid in 
their room is a mess because they'd been

894
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:19,180
playing and you think,
well that room can't be a mess.

895
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:20,103
Why?

896
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:22,773
Well,
it's hard to play in a messy room that 

897
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,453
that might be one answer.
So you have to restructure it so that 

898
00:50:26,711 --> 00:50:30,290
you can have so that you can play again,
that's part of why it should be clean.

899
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:35,780
So then you tell the four year old clean
up this room and then you leave and then

900
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:37,730
you come back and it's like nothing's 
happened.

901
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:39,043
And the reason for that in part perhaps 
is because that's the wrong level of 

902
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:46,370
resolution to solve the problem at with 
regards to the four year old,

903
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:47,803
you could only say clean up your room,
which would be maybe at the same level 

904
00:50:50,571 --> 00:50:55,571
as say family care there to someone who 
has the underlying structures already in

905
00:50:55,671 --> 00:50:58,610
place.
So you might say to the child,

906
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,373
see your shelf.
And they can do that because they know 

907
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,434
how to follow pointing and they know how
to specify an absence and they know how 

908
00:51:06,561 --> 00:51:07,700
to link that to language.

909
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,230
So they will do that.
See that hole?

910
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:10,460
Yes.
Okay.

911
00:51:10,461 --> 00:51:14,900
So you know the person has enough skill 
underneath that abstraction to implement

912
00:51:14,901 --> 00:51:15,800
it.
Fine.

913
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:20,120
Then you say see that bear and you know 
they can manage that.

914
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:22,370
So they look at the bear and you say,
well,

915
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,260
pick up the bear.
You know they can do that.

916
00:51:24,261 --> 00:51:27,800
So they pick up the bear and you'd give 
them a pat and then you say,

917
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:30,890
put the bear in this space.
And they do that and they look at,

918
00:51:30,891 --> 00:51:32,870
you need to give them a pat.
And it's like,

919
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:37,700
and if you do that with a child for the 
whole room three or four times,

920
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:38,833
then what you're doing is building the 
under structures right from the bottom 

921
00:51:41,781 --> 00:51:45,020
up.
And then you can say clean up your room.

922
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,690
So,
but if the child,

923
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:50,420
so exempt for example,
you come back in the room isn't clean,

924
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,433
you might think,
well what do you do about a child who's 

925
00:51:53,631 --> 00:51:56,750
being intransigent and won't clean up 
their room?

926
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:58,610
And answer is,
well,

927
00:51:58,611 --> 00:52:01,640
the first thing you do is make sure that
that's the right level of instruction.

928
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,320
And that's the case.
Also,

929
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:07,430
if you're negotiating with a partner or 
an intimate partner,

930
00:52:07,431 --> 00:52:10,010
the first thing you should assume if 
they do something stupid,

931
00:52:10,011 --> 00:52:12,470
which they certainly will,
is that they're stupid,

932
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,230
you know,
and that you have to help them out.

933
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,093
Building the micro structures of 
whatever it is that you're asking them 

934
00:52:18,621 --> 00:52:22,190
to do because people aren't,
people are full of gaping holes and they

935
00:52:22,191 --> 00:52:24,320
lack social skills of all sorts.
It's like,

936
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:29,570
and it's a huge part of the tension 
between friends and between couples.

937
00:52:29,571 --> 00:52:33,680
It's like its absence of ability.
And so you do your person a great favor.

938
00:52:33,681 --> 00:52:36,380
If you say um,
you know,

939
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,280
you forgot my birthday,
okay well what am I supposed to do about

940
00:52:40,281 --> 00:52:41,114
that?
While you might say well that's up to 

941
00:52:41,811 --> 00:52:42,470
you to figure it out.

942
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:43,303
So No,
assume I'm stupid and tell me exactly 

943
00:52:45,921 --> 00:52:46,754
what you want.
And then you'll say well that doesn't 

944
00:52:48,621 --> 00:52:49,454
really mean anything.
And I'll say yeah but we're going to be 

945
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:52,004
like together for 30 years.
So if you teach me this one time and 

946
00:52:54,681 --> 00:52:58,910
it's kind of awkward and stupid then 
maybe the next time it'll be 50% better.

947
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,013
You know,
cause well cause you're looking at a 

948
00:53:01,131 --> 00:53:02,360
trajectory,
right?

949
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,760
And so you can build,
cause one of the things,

950
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:05,594
look,
one of the things you could think about 

951
00:53:06,441 --> 00:53:11,030
for example,
is let's say you make a meal.

952
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,280
Okay.
Now let's say your,

953
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:14,143
your,
your goal is to make a really good meal 

954
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,800
in an efficient way so that everybody's 
really happy about it,

955
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,593
including you,
so that the probability that you'll get 

956
00:53:26,431 --> 00:53:27,264
to eat lots of really good meals across 
your whole life goes up not to good 

957
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:33,810
solution.
So then you might think,

958
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:37,200
okay,
I made this meal and it was,

959
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,093
it was a costly expenditure of time,
and I have to be paid for that in some 

960
00:53:42,841 --> 00:53:45,180
way in order to be happy about it.
So let's,

961
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:46,014
let's,
let's think about that for a minute 

962
00:53:46,981 --> 00:53:47,814
because it's a concrete product.
So let's say you spent a bunch of time 

963
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,750
making a good meal.
Okay?

964
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,540
What do you,
what do you not want people to do?

965
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:57,583
Yeah.

966
00:53:59,020 --> 00:53:59,801
Okay.
Okay.

967
00:53:59,801 --> 00:54:01,570
So they're not supposed to say,
Ooh,

968
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,830
what's this?
Hmm.

969
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,630
Okay,
that's a bad response.

970
00:54:04,631 --> 00:54:06,130
What else do you not want them to do?

971
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:09,270
Not enjoyed.

972
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:10,371
Right,
right,

973
00:54:10,371 --> 00:54:11,001
right,
right.

974
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:11,834
Okay,
so there's not going to be a lot of 

975
00:54:12,231 --> 00:54:13,880
bickering at the table,
right?

976
00:54:13,881 --> 00:54:14,714
Because then you're going to think what 
kind of stupid idiot would make a nice 

977
00:54:17,391 --> 00:54:20,240
meal for this lot of like insane 
chimpanzees.

978
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:22,760
Right?
So you're not going to want to replicate

979
00:54:22,761 --> 00:54:23,594
that.
What else would,

980
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,640
would you,
would you want them not to do?

981
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,390
Not Finish it.

982
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:28,710
Yup.
Okay.

983
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:32,100
What else?
Not help clean up.

984
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:32,910
Yeah.
Right.

985
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:33,743
Not Be grateful.
Not Notice that you put a lot of time 

986
00:54:36,001 --> 00:54:36,834
and effort into it.
Not notice that it's above the normal 

987
00:54:39,631 --> 00:54:42,570
standards that you sort of went above 
and beyond the call of duty.

988
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:45,000
Right?
Maybe show a little bit of thankfulness.

989
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:46,740
Yeah.
So then you think,

990
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:47,574
okay,
well I want to set up my life so that I 

991
00:54:48,721 --> 00:54:49,554
get to eat really good meals for the 
rest of my life and be happy about 

992
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,270
making them.
He's like,

993
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,113
okay,
well what are the preconditions for 

994
00:54:54,781 --> 00:54:55,614
that?
Well then you have to fight for the 

995
00:54:57,811 --> 00:55:02,811
preconditions because the alternative is
you cook slop miserably and you fight.

996
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:06,630
Right.
And one of the things that's interesting

997
00:55:06,631 --> 00:55:07,464
about,
one of the things that I don't have to 

998
00:55:08,311 --> 00:55:09,144
do with my clients is we do some 
arithmetic because people have a weird 

999
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:14,100
idea about what's important in their 
life.

1000
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:18,000
So you might think you got 16 hours a 
day of awake time,

1001
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,410
right?
So,

1002
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:24,060
and you're going to spend four of those 
hours,

1003
00:55:24,061 --> 00:55:27,270
three of those hours interacting with 
food.

1004
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:28,890
Okay?
So that's,

1005
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,730
let's say for let's say three.
It's one fifth of your life,

1006
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,850
20% of your life.
Okay,

1007
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:38,310
get it right.
Get it right.

1008
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,950
It's 20% of your life you got to taking 
care of.

1009
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,840
Wow,
perfect.

1010
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:43,801
You know,
you think,

1011
00:55:43,801 --> 00:55:45,480
well,
who's going to think about think through

1012
00:55:45,481 --> 00:55:46,410
those things?
It's like,

1013
00:55:46,411 --> 00:55:47,730
well,
do the math.

1014
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:49,230
It's not math,
it's arithmetic.

1015
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:50,571
It's like,
you know,

1016
00:55:50,571 --> 00:55:53,970
and so sometimes people will come to me 
and they'll say,

1017
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,930
I have to fight with my child for an 
hour a night to get them to go to bed.

1018
00:55:58,410 --> 00:55:59,131
I think,
okay,

1019
00:55:59,131 --> 00:55:59,964
let's do the arithmetic.
So how long have you been fighting with 

1020
00:56:02,851 --> 00:56:03,810
them?
Six months.

1021
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,340
How long do you think this will 
continue?

1022
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:07,860
Indefinitely?
Two years.

1023
00:56:07,861 --> 00:56:09,480
Okay.
So let's say it's two years.

1024
00:56:09,481 --> 00:56:10,500
Okay?
So that's,

1025
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,640
we're going to say that's 800 days for 
the sake of simplicity in math,

1026
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:15,871
let's say.
Yeah,

1027
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:20,871
we'll say 800 and so that's 800 hours.
And so that's 20 work weeks.

1028
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:28,740
So in the next two years you're going to
spend five months of work weeks fighting

1029
00:56:29,501 --> 00:56:30,970
with your child.
Okay?

1030
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:32,770
You expect to like them at the end of 
that,

1031
00:56:32,771 --> 00:56:33,604
do you,
it's like you're going to fight with 

1032
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:39,391
someone for like five months and you're 
going to like them.

1033
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:42,850
No,
that isn't going to happen.

1034
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:44,081
So you might think,
well,

1035
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:46,030
how important is it to solve that 
problem?

1036
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:49,900
Well,
it's five months of work,

1037
00:56:49,901 --> 00:56:50,734
weeks worth of importance.
You could put a week into it and you 

1038
00:56:52,751 --> 00:56:53,980
know,
it might be helpful.

1039
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,320
And so it's,
it's very,

1040
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,220
okay.

1041
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:02,730
I'm trying to make a case that you have 
to look at the hierarchy,

1042
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,220
the hierarchical structure of your 
values,

1043
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:06,054
you know?
And the best way to do that often is by 

1044
00:57:08,221 --> 00:57:10,560
paying close attention to things that 
people,

1045
00:57:10,561 --> 00:57:11,394
normally they're invisible.
Normally they're invisible and that's 

1046
00:57:17,941 --> 00:57:19,590
not good.
You have to fix them.

1047
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:22,080
And if you fix all those things,
a little tiny things,

1048
00:57:22,081 --> 00:57:23,730
if you fix them,
which is hard,

1049
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,593
you know,
it takes negotiation but it's not 

1050
00:57:25,411 --> 00:57:26,520
impossible,
you know,

1051
00:57:26,521 --> 00:57:29,250
cause it's the first thing you want to 
ask your partner or your family is,

1052
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,260
well,
how would we like to have a meal?

1053
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,333
You want wretched,
nasty food that someone just threw 

1054
00:57:33,751 --> 00:57:36,930
together and it's burnt and we're going 
to fight about it all the time.

1055
00:57:36,931 --> 00:57:39,510
And it's really erratic and it's not 
predictable.

1056
00:57:39,511 --> 00:57:40,344
And,
and the person who's making it as 

1057
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:42,024
unhappy and the kitchen is a disaster 
afterwards and everybody's angry about 

1058
00:57:45,331 --> 00:57:46,830
that.
So that's like one solution.

1059
00:57:46,831 --> 00:57:47,664
Do you want that?
And if they all are sensible enough to 

1060
00:57:50,041 --> 00:57:51,900
say no,
then then you can say to them,

1061
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:56,200
okay,
well what's the alternative?

1062
00:57:57,070 --> 00:57:58,000
And then you can think,
well,

1063
00:57:58,001 --> 00:57:58,834
we could imagine what the alternative 
would be and then we can work on laying 

1064
00:58:03,101 --> 00:58:06,070
out the microprocessors that would lead 
to that outcome.

1065
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:06,933
And we can practice them over time.
And we can assume that if we don't get 

1066
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:11,380
it right in three months,
that doesn't mean it's hopeless.

1067
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,293
And so

1068
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:21,310
when Freud,
let me give you an example.

1069
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:31,500
I was reading a Gartman study the other 
day on marital stability.

1070
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:36,650
Gottman has done some really good 
analysis of couples behavior.

1071
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:38,183
He has set up a lab that's basically a 
bed and breakfast and he brings couples 

1072
00:58:41,911 --> 00:58:42,744
in there for a weekend and he wires the 
mop physiologically and monitors their 

1073
00:58:46,801 --> 00:58:48,270
reactivity.
And so what he's,

1074
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:52,230
he can predict whether a couple's going 
to divorce with 95 94% accuracy.

1075
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:55,280
It's like impressive.
So what does he found?

1076
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:57,653
He's found two categories of he's,
he's identified two phenomena that are 

1077
00:59:02,161 --> 00:59:02,994
very much worth knowing.
The first is that the couples who are 

1078
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:08,844
going to get divorced and they come into
the bed and breakfast and they speak 

1079
00:59:13,141 --> 00:59:13,974
with each other quite commonly,
but it's more walking on eggs calm and 

1080
00:59:19,651 --> 00:59:21,650
well,
they're speaking with each other calmly.

1081
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,610
Their physiology is like,
they're very aroused and so,

1082
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,550
so they're sort of aroused like someone 
who's facing a predator.

1083
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,593
So you might think about an unhappy 
couple as Predator and prey to each 

1084
00:59:33,021 --> 00:59:33,854
other.
And so the words are there mostly to 

1085
00:59:36,051 --> 00:59:40,940
stop predatory activity,
not to actually communicate anything.

1086
00:59:40,941 --> 00:59:44,510
It's just to keep the surface comp.
So then you might think,

1087
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:47,280
well what's under the surface?
And one,

1088
00:59:47,281 --> 00:59:50,870
it's under the surface.
So Freud would say it's what's under the

1089
00:59:50,871 --> 00:59:55,100
surface is unconscious and,
but you can say,

1090
00:59:55,101 --> 00:59:56,900
well,
what's under the surface is one of these

1091
00:59:56,901 --> 00:59:59,710
hierarchies that's all banged up and 
twisted and,

1092
00:59:59,711 --> 01:00:02,150
and,
and not in reasonable shape.

1093
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,910
And so people don't want to open the 
door to that.

1094
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:06,920
So,
but they do.

1095
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,260
This is a Freudian slip.
So let's say this,

1096
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:11,900
this goes to the second part of 
Gottman's observations.

1097
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:17,470
So the woman goes over to the window and
she says,

1098
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:20,900
oh look,
there's a cardinal outside,

1099
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:22,010
you know,
cardinals,

1100
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:24,050
that bright red bird,
that kind of cool looking,

1101
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:25,053
you know,
it's kind of a trivial thing in some 

1102
01:00:26,811 --> 01:00:27,200
sense.

1103
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,880
But by the same token,
it's like,

1104
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,700
it's a little positive thing.
And you know,

1105
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:35,330
20 of them in a day is good thing.
Okay.

1106
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:36,550
So then the,
uh,

1107
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:40,070
the partner,
the husband in this example has a two by

1108
01:00:40,071 --> 01:00:43,250
two matrix of choices.
One is,

1109
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:46,010
who the hell cares about your stupid 
bird?

1110
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:47,240
Okay,
so that's one.

1111
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:52,040
The second one is then you go over and 
look at the bird,

1112
01:00:52,041 --> 01:00:55,580
right?
And then the third one is you don't make

1113
01:00:55,581 --> 01:00:56,414
the contempt noise but yanked it out.
And the fourth one is you go over there 

1114
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:02,630
like a civilized human being and you 
know,

1115
01:01:02,631 --> 01:01:05,780
and that you're interacting with someone
that you care for and you take a look at

1116
01:01:05,781 --> 01:01:07,750
the damn bird and you're happy about it 
and it,

1117
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:12,500
and that's as truthful and real as you 
can manage.

1118
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:17,300
Okay,
so the option,

1119
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:20,300
that's a Freudian slip,
right?

1120
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:23,540
Because what it says,
there's a whole monster underneath that.

1121
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:24,374
And the monster is all the 
disorganization in this entire 

1122
01:01:28,011 --> 01:01:30,950
structure.
It's like the might be,

1123
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:37,060
we have been tormenting each other about
various things for the last 10 years and

1124
01:01:37,581 --> 01:01:38,414
none of them are resolved.
And I'm not very happy about you for so 

1125
01:01:42,111 --> 01:01:44,510
many reasons.
I can't even remember all of them.

1126
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:47,660
And I'm,
I can't enumerate them right now because

1127
01:01:47,661 --> 01:01:49,430
that would take forever.
And it may be,

1128
01:01:49,431 --> 01:01:52,580
we would have a huge fight,
but by the same token,

1129
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,180
I'm not going to come over there and 
make you happy with your stupid bird.

1130
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:57,373
And I'm going to indicate that subtly.
So you can't call me a son of a bitch 

1131
01:01:59,961 --> 01:02:03,470
because I've just sighing and that's 
what I'll say if you do ask me.

1132
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:06,890
But I'm going to load all that up and 
I'm going to deliver it to you.

1133
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:08,203
And what's going to happen to you is 
because you're smart is your heart 

1134
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:12,260
rate's going to go way up,
like you're being attacked.

1135
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:16,760
And the reason for that is you are.
So what the good couples do,

1136
01:02:16,761 --> 01:02:20,760
the couples that you know stay together 
is they respond to each other's bids,

1137
01:02:20,761 --> 01:02:24,780
he calls them bids.
And so if one person wants to share some

1138
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:27,510
little trivial daily positive thing with
the other,

1139
01:02:27,511 --> 01:02:28,620
the other,
you know,

1140
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:30,053
isn't carrying around a bloody cartload 
of resentment and is able to respond to 

1141
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:35,874
that in a positive way.
And that way the general interactions 

1142
01:02:39,421 --> 01:02:40,254
between the couple stay positive,
but that's also because they've worked 

1143
01:02:43,321 --> 01:02:45,030
this out.
Now,

1144
01:02:45,031 --> 01:02:45,864
you know it's gotta be because they work
it out because the couples who are 

1145
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:52,080
physiologically reactive to each other,
they're communicating,

1146
01:02:52,081 --> 01:02:52,914
but there's all sorts of horror 
underneath the surface and we're trying 

1147
01:02:56,341 --> 01:02:56,851
to figure out,
well,

1148
01:02:56,851 --> 01:02:59,040
what is it that's underneath the 
surface?

1149
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:02,580
What's the structure of the unconscious?
Well,

1150
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:04,103
that's the structure of the unconscious 
and it's either well structured and 

1151
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:12,090
functional and mutually agreed to porn 
and as explicit as possible,

1152
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:17,250
or it's this constantly and then when 
the couples fight about it,

1153
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:20,410
yes,

1154
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:21,243
because they're not very sophisticated 
and they're not very awake and they're 

1155
01:03:23,411 --> 01:03:24,244
not very aware and they don't know how 
to do micro analysis and they're tired 

1156
01:03:26,861 --> 01:03:29,950
and unhappy.
They don't say,

1157
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:36,600
I would rather that you use cloth 
napkins when we have a formal dinner.

1158
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:37,493
Then paper Napkins,
they say you do a bad job of 

1159
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:42,090
entertaining.
Well,

1160
01:03:42,091 --> 01:03:43,560
that's not helpful,
right?

1161
01:03:43,561 --> 01:03:44,394
It's like you're wiping out the person.
That bad job of entertaining would be 

1162
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:52,650
probably about at the level of family 
care in the hierarchy.

1163
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:53,873
And so what you're doing is you're 
hitting them in a place that if they 

1164
01:03:56,731 --> 01:03:57,564
listened to you would knock out maybe 
10% of their entire be behavioral and 

1165
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:03,624
perceptual structure.
It's like you really want to do that to 

1166
01:04:06,151 --> 01:04:06,984
some,
you only want to do that to someone 

1167
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:10,350
under extreme conditions,
right?

1168
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:14,550
Extreme conditions.
And that would be something like,

1169
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:16,390
okay,

1170
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:21,070
maybe a warning to a child who's gone 
astray very badly,

1171
01:04:21,071 --> 01:04:22,750
but you know,
has the skills,

1172
01:04:22,751 --> 01:04:23,620
you'd say,
well,

1173
01:04:24,070 --> 01:04:24,903
the kind of mistakes that you're making 
are sufficiently catastrophic so that 

1174
01:04:27,821 --> 01:04:30,070
your life is going to go off course,
you know?

1175
01:04:30,071 --> 01:04:32,590
And then you might have a conversation 
with them about,

1176
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:37,370
often for kids,
for guide,

1177
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,820
for people that say are between 15 and 
25 I know they're not kids really,

1178
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:43,640
but my kids are that age.
Part of that might be,

1179
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,560
what the hell are you going to do for a 
career?

1180
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:47,390
Right?
And if that's an unspecified,

1181
01:04:47,391 --> 01:04:50,060
the person's just all over the place.
So,

1182
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:52,010
okay,
so,

1183
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,960
so here's some slides that represent 
that.

1184
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:16,420
Great.
So you see the progression of that.

1185
01:05:16,421 --> 01:05:17,254
And if,
if things are operating at the top of 

1186
01:05:19,211 --> 01:05:20,044
the hierarchy that what that means is 
you've mastered all the subsidiary 

1187
01:05:23,861 --> 01:05:27,310
elements and you've built them.
It's not only from the bottom up,

1188
01:05:27,311 --> 01:05:30,400
but because the levels crosstalk,
right?

1189
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,490
You know,
so you can use,

1190
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:34,563
and that's the next thing we're going to
talk about because you're not just a 

1191
01:05:36,281 --> 01:05:39,880
behavioral creature.
You're not just an animal like a chimp.

1192
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,470
You're capable.
There's,

1193
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:43,630
there's things you can do that animals 
can't do.

1194
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:44,703
And what that is,
is that not only can you act things out 

1195
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:48,993
in a manner that through action,
we'll organize your hierarchy because 

1196
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:52,414
that's what animals do.
But you can also represent that 

1197
01:05:54,641 --> 01:05:57,580
hierarchy.
You can think about the hierarchy,

1198
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:01,990
you can articulate the hierarchy and you
can play with it abstractly.

1199
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:05,260
And that's what you're doing when you're
engaging in philosophy.

1200
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:07,420
And that's also what you're doing when 
you're negotiating.

1201
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:08,493
And that's a really good thing because 
it means that you can not only 

1202
01:06:11,021 --> 01:06:13,480
conceptualize changes and then implement
them.

1203
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:14,713
And,
and you can conceptualize a broad range 

1204
01:06:16,151 --> 01:06:16,984
of potential potential changes and 
improvements and you can implement them 

1205
01:06:19,751 --> 01:06:23,740
and you can observe what happens.
But you can also communicate that to all

1206
01:06:23,741 --> 01:06:26,380
sorts of other people.
So it's a great thing to be able to do.

1207
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:31,680
The problem with it is obviously that 
because you can abstractly represent and

1208
01:06:32,381 --> 01:06:33,214
question,
you can also knock the hell out of your 

1209
01:06:35,261 --> 01:06:37,420
belief in the top elements of the 
hierarchy.

1210
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:38,643
It's like,
well what does it mean to be a good 

1211
01:06:39,401 --> 01:06:41,020
person anyways?
You know?

1212
01:06:41,021 --> 01:06:43,060
Or why should I be a good person?
Or is there any,

1213
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:45,910
is there any utility or meaning and 
being a good person?

1214
01:06:45,911 --> 01:06:46,744
Or is there even any,
isn't even reasonable to say that there 

1215
01:06:48,451 --> 01:06:49,150
is such a thing.

1216
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:52,480
He's a good person.
It's like I think all of those questions

1217
01:06:52,481 --> 01:06:53,314
in some sense are ill post.
And the reason I think that is because 

1218
01:06:55,631 --> 01:06:57,310
they're at the wrong level of 
resolution.

1219
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:58,533
You know,
you don't throw the damn baby out with 

1220
01:06:59,411 --> 01:07:00,244
the bath water so to speak.
So if you're going to critique 

1221
01:07:01,721 --> 01:07:03,640
something,
don't start.

1222
01:07:03,641 --> 01:07:05,770
Don't start at the highest level of 
abstraction.

1223
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,083
And I think that's a big part of what's 
wrong with what people are taught in 

1224
01:07:09,101 --> 01:07:09,934
universities today because you're often 
talked to criticize systems at the 

1225
01:07:13,931 --> 01:07:15,760
highest level of obstruction.
It's like,

1226
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,830
well,
there's something wrong with capitalism.

1227
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:19,900
It's like,
really?

1228
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:21,880
Really?
You're going to do something about that?

1229
01:07:21,881 --> 01:07:22,714
Are you,
and it's going to work better in your 

1230
01:07:24,341 --> 01:07:26,440
lifetime.
That's going to happen.

1231
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:27,371
It's like,
no,

1232
01:07:27,371 --> 01:07:29,650
it's not going to happen.
You know,

1233
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:32,260
if you stick a stick in the,
in a functioning machine,

1234
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:33,094
even if you think the machine,
it's all rattling and it's like pulling 

1235
01:07:34,691 --> 01:07:38,080
people's arms in and it's got all sorts 
of catastrophic problems.

1236
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:40,840
You come home and like hit it with a 
stick.

1237
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:44,830
It's like it's not going to run better.
It's the wrong level of analysis.

1238
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:45,993
And just because you have a stick and 
you can see that the machine doesn't 

1239
01:07:47,921 --> 01:07:50,020
work very well,
it doesn't mean that you're very bright.

1240
01:07:50,021 --> 01:07:52,330
It's like obviously it doesn't work very
well,

1241
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:55,000
you know?
It's like that's not the issue.

1242
01:07:55,001 --> 01:07:59,380
The issue is could you improve it 
without making it worse?

1243
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:02,830
It's like now that's a big problem.
It's a big problem.

1244
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:08,670
So you know,
you have a wheelchair,

1245
01:08:08,891 --> 01:08:10,360
you know,
and the bearings are gone.

1246
01:08:10,361 --> 01:08:12,400
So the bloody thing just grinds away,
you know?

1247
01:08:12,401 --> 01:08:14,730
And maybe it's wobbly.
It doesn't work very well on ice.

1248
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:15,573
You know,
when you think,

1249
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:18,710
well that's a horrible wheelchair and 
you just take it from the person.

1250
01:08:18,711 --> 01:08:20,960
It's like then they're lying there on 
the ice,

1251
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:21,830
you know?

1252
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:22,431
It's like,
oh,

1253
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,264
that's helpful while you're,
you don't have that horrible wheelchair 

1254
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:26,810
anymore.
It's like,

1255
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:28,580
yeah,
brilliant.

1256
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:32,990
It's like so like a rattle trap thing 
that works is better than nothing.

1257
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:35,900
So if you're going to fix something,
well then you have to be,

1258
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:36,853
I would think about it more like what 
you would do if you had to fix a 

1259
01:08:38,961 --> 01:08:41,140
helicopter.
You know,

1260
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:44,540
like you're not going to critique the 
whole helicopter now.

1261
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:45,770
It's not going to be helpful.
It's like,

1262
01:08:45,771 --> 01:08:47,210
wow,
that's not a good helicopter.

1263
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,433
Right.
We can tell that because it's not 

1264
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:51,080
working very well.
Well what are you going to do?

1265
01:08:51,081 --> 01:08:51,914
Well then you have to learn a lot about 
the helicopter and all of its parts and 

1266
01:08:54,351 --> 01:08:55,184
how they function.
And then you have to figure out which 

1267
01:08:56,361 --> 01:08:57,194
part isn't working properly and then you
have to take that part out and then you 

1268
01:08:59,901 --> 01:09:03,110
have to find a better park and you have 
to put it back in.

1269
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:04,213
And then maybe the bloody thing or work,
but like a high level abstract solution 

1270
01:09:08,121 --> 01:09:10,400
to that.
Like helicopters aren't useful.

1271
01:09:10,401 --> 01:09:14,960
It's like not helpful.
And I use the helicopter example because

1272
01:09:14,961 --> 01:09:17,570
with a military helicopter,
if I remember correctly,

1273
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:21,440
you have to perform about 30 hours of 
maintenance for each hour.

1274
01:09:21,441 --> 01:09:24,290
The thing is in the air because like 
what's a helicopter?

1275
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:25,183
It's a big lump of metal.
It's really hard to get those things to 

1276
01:09:27,171 --> 01:09:28,790
stay in the air.
So,

1277
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:30,830
and everything we do is like that,
you know,

1278
01:09:30,831 --> 01:09:31,664
it's like the fact that the electricity 
is working in this room is a bloody 

1279
01:09:35,451 --> 01:09:38,810
miracle.
Like it's unbelievable that it works and

1280
01:09:38,811 --> 01:09:39,644
there it is working.
We don't even have to pay any attention 

1281
01:09:40,881 --> 01:09:44,450
to it and it always works.
It's like don't fix that.

1282
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:49,733
Right.

1283
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:52,630
It's a major response.
Denial isn't,

1284
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:54,173
yeah,
cause that's what we're trying to do 

1285
01:09:54,811 --> 01:09:55,644
here.
We're trying to figure out what the 

1286
01:09:56,491 --> 01:09:57,950
meaning of life.
Yes.

1287
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:01,290
That's the big talk on Thursday.
Yeah,

1288
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:02,410
right,
right.

1289
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:04,830
Well,
you should.

1290
01:10:04,831 --> 01:10:08,640
So that's also part of what people talk 
about when they talk about humility.

1291
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:11,250
Because if you look at classic religious
virtues,

1292
01:10:11,251 --> 01:10:12,084
and this is true,
I believe it's true of virtually every 

1293
01:10:14,191 --> 01:10:16,230
religious system that I've been able to 
study.

1294
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:18,540
You know,
it's like humility.

1295
01:10:18,990 --> 01:10:20,130
Okay,
so what does that mean?

1296
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:22,920
Start at the bottom.
You know,

1297
01:10:22,921 --> 01:10:23,754
it's like fix the little things.
But then the other thing is little 

1298
01:10:25,771 --> 01:10:27,000
things aren't little.
You just,

1299
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:27,481
you know,
they're,

1300
01:10:27,481 --> 01:10:28,314
they're not little.
And we already went through that with 

1301
01:10:29,731 --> 01:10:32,370
the example of mealtime.
It's like,

1302
01:10:32,371 --> 01:10:33,204
well,
how much fuss should you make about 

1303
01:10:33,901 --> 01:10:35,970
meals?
What's 20% of your life?

1304
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,150
So how much faster would you make about 
that?

1305
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:40,373
Well,
you should expand 20% of your energy 

1306
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:44,070
getting that right.
And if you get it right,

1307
01:10:44,071 --> 01:10:45,210
it's like an art,
right?

1308
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:48,030
Because,
because meal preparation,

1309
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,310
it's,
people are highly social.

1310
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:53,940
They're highly social eaters.
If they're not eating socially,

1311
01:10:53,941 --> 01:10:54,774
they're eating goes badly right away.
They can't regulate their intake and 

1312
01:10:57,901 --> 01:10:58,734
they eat terribly.
You see this with isolated people all 

1313
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:01,920
the time,
they don't even eat.

1314
01:11:01,921 --> 01:11:03,720
Or if they do eat,
it's like popcorn and,

1315
01:11:03,721 --> 01:11:05,550
and you know,
gummy worms or something.

1316
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:06,593
It's really not good.
And so it's very eating behavior among 

1317
01:11:09,841 --> 01:11:11,730
human beings is very,
very complex.

1318
01:11:11,731 --> 01:11:14,580
We're omnivores,
so we have way too much choice.

1319
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:16,920
Plus we're social eaters,
you know,

1320
01:11:16,921 --> 01:11:19,020
so it's hard to get that right,
but,

1321
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:19,883
and if you don't get it right,
everyone's sick and miserable and 

1322
01:11:21,241 --> 01:11:23,070
unhappy and irritable.
So,

1323
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:23,904
and if you get it right,
it's like you bring it right up to the 

1324
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:28,350
level of aesthetics and art.
It was like,

1325
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:29,184
that's way better.
So you know when also when you're 

1326
01:11:31,231 --> 01:11:33,390
thinking about things like the meaning 
of life,

1327
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,910
life has all sorts of meanings,
many,

1328
01:11:38,911 --> 01:11:39,744
many meanings.
And then the meetings are arranged in a 

1329
01:11:41,371 --> 01:11:42,204
hierarchy.
And so whether there's an meaning or 

1330
01:11:43,981 --> 01:11:46,470
many meanings depend on where you look 
in the hierarchy.

1331
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:47,933
But if you want your life to be better,
which might be some element of 

1332
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:53,160
meaningful life,
you know,

1333
01:11:53,161 --> 01:11:53,994
one of the things you can start doing is
start doing all the things that you 

1334
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:58,680
actually do right?
Oh,

1335
01:11:58,681 --> 01:11:59,514
that'll improve things a lot.
And then once once you improve those 

1336
01:12:01,591 --> 01:12:02,424
things and then the way you're looking 
at the problem isn't even going to be 

1337
01:12:04,081 --> 01:12:04,914
the same pit,
fixed the micro routines and then see 

1338
01:12:07,591 --> 01:12:09,960
what happens.
It's like you might find that if you get

1339
01:12:09,961 --> 01:12:10,794
all the micro routines running properly,
the whole problem of nihilism just 

1340
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:18,390
vanishes.
So at least it's worth a shot.

1341
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:21,020
So,
okay,

1342
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:22,163
now here's the next thing we're going to
figure out is like how does that 

1343
01:12:25,261 --> 01:12:29,940
hierarchy come into being now for a long
time,

1344
01:12:29,941 --> 01:12:33,660
this is also a Nietzsche in observation 
for a long time,

1345
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,033
and this is also,
this is also the basis of conspiracy 

1346
01:12:38,371 --> 01:12:42,060
theory,
conspiracy sits theory,

1347
01:12:42,061 --> 01:12:44,490
sociology.
I would say roughly speaking,

1348
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,353
it's like Freud critiqued religion.
He said that it was a defense against 

1349
01:12:50,101 --> 01:12:52,200
death anxiety.
It's like

1350
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:54,903
there's a,
there's a couple of problems with a 

1351
01:12:55,781 --> 01:12:57,280
critique like that.
It's like

1352
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,760
it's partly a defense against death 
anxiety.

1353
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:04,583
So one of the things that you really 
want to watch when you're listening to 

1354
01:13:06,391 --> 01:13:07,224
thinkers and when you're trying to 
figure out how to organize your thought 

1355
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,433
is you really,
really want to be skeptical of people 

1356
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:16,050
who boil things down to one prop 
principal.

1357
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,260
So for example,
marks,

1358
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:22,800
it's economics and class struggle.
It's like,

1359
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:24,053
well,
is that relevant to the study of 

1360
01:13:24,961 --> 01:13:26,490
societies?
Yes,

1361
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:29,370
we're structured in dominance 
hierarchies when we trade,

1362
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:33,120
it's a big deal.
It's not the problem.

1363
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:34,913
It's one of many complex problems.
And so if you take a Marxist view of 

1364
01:13:38,701 --> 01:13:41,340
history,
what you basically do is you take a look

1365
01:13:41,341 --> 01:13:46,260
at history and you interpret it through 
an a priori set of axioms,

1366
01:13:46,261 --> 01:13:50,250
which is that everything that happened 
was determined by economic causes.

1367
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:51,653
Well the ant,
the thing is you can do that because 

1368
01:13:54,091 --> 01:13:54,924
every single thing that ever happened is
determined in part by economic 

1369
01:13:59,101 --> 01:13:59,820
consequences.

1370
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:00,653
So all you have to do or causes,
all you have to do is ignore all the 

1371
01:14:03,571 --> 01:14:07,380
other causes and come up with a really 
coherent narrative that you can,

1372
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:09,780
that you can do.
Anybody who is a Marxist can do that.

1373
01:14:09,781 --> 01:14:12,340
And like three tenths of a second cause 
it's like a machine.

1374
01:14:12,341 --> 01:14:13,174
You know,
it's like,

1375
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:14,320
what was,
how,

1376
01:14:14,321 --> 01:14:17,170
it's funny,
I was talking to a guy the other day and

1377
01:14:17,171 --> 01:14:18,010
he's,
he's one of,

1378
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:19,100
he's an idiot log.
And,

1379
01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:20,043
and I asked him a question,
this has been bugging me for a long 

1380
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:23,260
time.
It's like I thought,

1381
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,233
you know,
in Greece everybody cheats on their 

1382
01:14:26,231 --> 01:14:27,100
income tax,
right?

1383
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:27,963
And so that's not so good because the 
government can't work and then the 

1384
01:14:31,091 --> 01:14:34,030
economy fails and then everyone starves.
So you might say,

1385
01:14:34,031 --> 01:14:36,100
why shouldn't you cheat on your income 
tax?

1386
01:14:36,101 --> 01:14:36,934
And the answer is,
well then the government won't work and 

1387
01:14:38,711 --> 01:14:40,720
the economy will collapse and everyone 
will starve.

1388
01:14:40,721 --> 01:14:43,150
So don't cheat on your income tax.
You know,

1389
01:14:43,151 --> 01:14:43,984
and you think,
well I can cheat and that won't really 

1390
01:14:45,341 --> 01:14:46,121
matter.
It's like,

1391
01:14:46,121 --> 01:14:47,020
no,
it matters.

1392
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,273
Here's why.
So let's say you're doing your income 

1393
01:14:51,941 --> 01:14:53,800
tax and you're pissed off about it 
because like,

1394
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:54,693
you know,
you're giving away your money and you 

1395
01:14:55,631 --> 01:14:57,760
don't know which it's being well spent.
And of course,

1396
01:14:57,761 --> 01:15:01,300
mostly it's not because mostly nothing 
works very well.

1397
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:02,523
And so you think,
well I can cheat because I'm only one 

1398
01:15:04,301 --> 01:15:07,060
person and you know how,
how does it matter?

1399
01:15:07,061 --> 01:15:07,894
But then you think,

1400
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:14,083
imagine we were all supposed to put 
money into a pool and then take money 

1401
01:15:18,741 --> 01:15:19,574
out and I knew that one of you wasn't 
putting money in the pool but that you 

1402
01:15:23,911 --> 01:15:25,280
were going to take it out I'd think,
ah,

1403
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:27,140
well whatever one person,
you know,

1404
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:29,210
crooked psychopath,
we'll just,

1405
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:30,890
we don't have to worry about that 
person.

1406
01:15:31,370 --> 01:15:32,203
And then it's like three people and then
it's like eight and then it's 10 and 

1407
01:15:35,571 --> 01:15:36,404
then it's 10% of the room and 10% seems 
to be something like a tipping point at 

1408
01:15:40,791 --> 01:15:41,624
some point.
Certainly if you're the only person 

1409
01:15:44,361 --> 01:15:47,600
putting money in that pot and everyone 
else is taking your,

1410
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:51,140
anybody with any sense is going to think
that there are complete blithering idiot

1411
01:15:51,470 --> 01:15:53,120
and they're going to start playing that 
game.

1412
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:54,013
Right.
So the question is at what point do you 

1413
01:15:56,421 --> 01:15:57,254
collect enough cheaters so that the s 
the people who are basically honest 

1414
01:16:00,141 --> 01:16:03,180
start feeling like the game is crooked 
and quit playing?

1415
01:16:03,650 --> 01:16:04,483
While the answer is probably something 
like 10% so art back to the back to the 

1416
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:14,643
Floridians.

1417
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:17,880
Now I don't remember why I told you that
story.

1418
01:16:17,881 --> 01:16:19,950
It had to do with economic 
determination.

1419
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:22,920
Oh,
right.

1420
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:24,630
Thank you.
Thank you.

1421
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:26,040
Okay,
so this is the story.

1422
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,890
So I'm thinking,
well,

1423
01:16:28,891 --> 01:16:29,724
if that's the case,
if like 10% is a tipping point or 30% I 

1424
01:16:33,031 --> 01:16:34,200
don't care,
whatever it is,

1425
01:16:34,201 --> 01:16:35,034
50 I don't care.
There's a tipping point is at some 

1426
01:16:37,501 --> 01:16:41,010
point,
if it's a minority of people,

1427
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,380
if they're corrupt,
can bring down the whole system.

1428
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:47,190
How in the world do you ever create a 
system that isn't corrupt?

1429
01:16:47,730 --> 01:16:51,690
Because all everybody almost has to play
it honestly before the thing will work.

1430
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:56,250
And so how do people get from the point 
where it's chaotic and corrupt,

1431
01:16:56,251 --> 01:16:58,260
which is the case in most of the world,
by the way,

1432
01:16:58,261 --> 01:17:01,710
right?
Most places are insanely corrupt.

1433
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:04,200
Some places aren't.
It's like,

1434
01:17:04,230 --> 01:17:06,650
how the hell did that happen?
I don't get it.

1435
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:08,820
It doesn't seem possible to me that that
happened.

1436
01:17:08,821 --> 01:17:13,160
I understand it because the default is 
obviously chaos and corruption.

1437
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:15,860
That's easy.
So anybody can do that.

1438
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:19,040
It's like sometimes systems work and 
they're more or less honest.

1439
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:20,990
Like Ebay is a really good example of 
that.

1440
01:17:20,991 --> 01:17:21,860
It's like,
poof,

1441
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:25,910
I proxy bay,
what's the average level of cheating?

1442
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,650
It's like zero,
you know,

1443
01:17:27,651 --> 01:17:30,320
it's unbelievably honest and it's a 
murder.

1444
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:32,450
It's a miracle.
Nobody thought that would happen.

1445
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:33,973
So how the hell does that happen?
So I was asking a friend of mine and 

1446
01:17:37,461 --> 01:17:38,294
this guy too,
and I laid this out and like I didn't 

1447
01:17:40,641 --> 01:17:42,560
even get finished the question and he 
said,

1448
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:44,360
government.
And I said,

1449
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:45,440
well,
what do you mean?

1450
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:45,831
He said,
oh,

1451
01:17:45,831 --> 01:17:48,460
it's those places that don't have too 
much government that are honest.

1452
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:49,910
It's like,
well thank you.

1453
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:51,043
I mean,
I thought that was a complicated 

1454
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:52,634
problem.

1455
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:53,570
You know?
And here are you,

1456
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:54,583
you didn't even have to listen to the 
whole damn question before you had an 

1457
01:17:56,691 --> 01:17:58,190
answer.
It's government.

1458
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,890
Oh well I'll stop thinking about that 
right now.

1459
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:05,330
It's like God really,
really come on,

1460
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:07,430
you know,
one,

1461
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:11,060
one,
one,

1462
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:11,894
a single causal answers to complex 
questions and it's like all the tapping 

1463
01:18:17,391 --> 01:18:20,510
there is that the person is playing an 
intellectual game.

1464
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:24,230
That's all that's happening.
They've got this set of axioms.

1465
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:27,440
They've learned how to manipulate them.
It's like chess game basically,

1466
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:30,320
and no matter what the problem is that 
you throw at them,

1467
01:18:30,321 --> 01:18:32,810
they can run them through the algorithm 
and pop out announcer.

1468
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:34,760
It's not helpful.
It's like,

1469
01:18:34,761 --> 01:18:36,050
because for me,
for example,

1470
01:18:36,051 --> 01:18:38,900
that question only sets,
even if he's right,

1471
01:18:38,901 --> 01:18:39,734
it only sets the problem back one step.
It's okay if government is the cause of 

1472
01:18:43,821 --> 01:18:45,290
corruption,
which it isn't.

1473
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:49,160
It's an because of corruption and it's 
also the solution to corruption.

1474
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,113
But if it is that because of corruption,
then how come some places have more 

1475
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:56,630
government than others?
It's like there's no information in that

1476
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:57,464
statement.
All there is is a rephrasing of the 

1477
01:18:58,821 --> 01:19:01,250
problem.
It looks like announcer,

1478
01:19:01,251 --> 01:19:04,300
it's got nothing to do with announcer.
So,

1479
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,353
and what I,
one of the things that really disturbs 

1480
01:19:06,681 --> 01:19:08,930
me about modern university education is 
that,

1481
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:10,303
you know,
a quarter of the people who are in the 

1482
01:19:11,631 --> 01:19:14,780
humanities and of the distribution are 
being taught to think this way.

1483
01:19:14,781 --> 01:19:15,561
It's like,
well,

1484
01:19:15,561 --> 01:19:17,960
here's,
here's a little rubric power.

1485
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:18,973
That would be the postmodernist 
deconstructionist routine courtesy of 

1486
01:19:23,301 --> 01:19:24,134
Derrida who was a Marxist,
and you take his propositions and you 

1487
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:29,264
can apply them to everything.
It's like it's not helpful and it's not 

1488
01:19:31,191 --> 01:19:32,024
thinking it doesn't do anything.
It just gives you the illusion of of 

1489
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:36,980
thinking.
So,

1490
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:37,873
okay,
so

1491
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:47,333
let me just take here now for a minute.
So we were talking about ideological 

1492
01:19:51,150 --> 01:19:52,680
propositions.
Yes,

1493
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:53,581
yes.
Okay.

1494
01:19:53,581 --> 01:19:54,414
So what seemed to happen once the slats 
were knocked out of the assumption that 

1495
01:20:02,521 --> 01:20:05,400
there were fundamental assumptions that 
you could rely on.

1496
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:06,263
So let's say like the existence God and 
that your relationship to God was an 

1497
01:20:09,931 --> 01:20:10,764
indication of the greater good.
The greater good was an actual concrete 

1498
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:14,874
thing in some sense.
Once the intellectual slacks were 

1499
01:20:18,331 --> 01:20:21,570
knocked out from underneath that,
then as Nietzsche pointed out,

1500
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,260
the power of organized religion started 
to decline.

1501
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,153
Now it's it,
it hasn't declined as rapidly or as 

1502
01:20:28,561 --> 01:20:30,900
thoroughly as everyone thought it might 
in the 20th century.

1503
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:31,763
Right?
Because the Americans have a pretty 

1504
01:20:33,271 --> 01:20:34,104
thriving Christianity on the right wing.
And then of course there's all sorts of 

1505
01:20:37,951 --> 01:20:39,600
fundamentalist movements all over the 
world.

1506
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:41,400
But we'll just put that aside for now.

1507
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:42,623
It doesn't really,
it doesn't have anything to do with the 

1508
01:20:45,601 --> 01:20:48,990
main issue in some sense.
Okay.

1509
01:20:48,991 --> 01:20:49,824
So then what is the consequence of not 
having the great cultural narratives 

1510
01:20:53,851 --> 01:20:55,080
anymore?
Well,

1511
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:58,710
there seems to be two.
One is everything's up in the air and no

1512
01:20:58,711 --> 01:21:01,650
one knows what to do.
And everybody has a question about every

1513
01:21:01,651 --> 01:21:02,484
single level of the hierarchy.
Like why are we doing this and what's 

1514
01:21:04,801 --> 01:21:07,260
the meaning of life and should we bother
doing anything at all?

1515
01:21:07,261 --> 01:21:09,690
And Are we running around destroying the
planet and you know,

1516
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:12,300
so on and so forth.
So it's chaotic.

1517
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:13,643
And the other one is people just 
transmute their religious beliefs into 

1518
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:17,663
another kind of monotheistic explanation
that's based on some intellectual 

1519
01:21:21,691 --> 01:21:23,310
proposition.
And so with the Marxists,

1520
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:24,420
for example,
it would be,

1521
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:27,210
um,
economic relationships with people.

1522
01:21:27,211 --> 01:21:31,620
For Freud,
Freud was not an unsophisticated thing,

1523
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:34,620
but he did try to boil everything down 
to sex and aggression,

1524
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:35,760
mostly sex.

1525
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,260
And he had his reasons.
He said,

1526
01:21:37,261 --> 01:21:37,741
well,
you know,

1527
01:21:37,741 --> 01:21:38,574
without sex you don't propagate.
And Propagation is obviously necessary 

1528
01:21:41,401 --> 01:21:45,450
for the continuation of life.
And therefore sexuality must be a main,

1529
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:49,020
the main function.
And it's a powerful claim.

1530
01:21:49,021 --> 01:21:52,140
But we do know if you look at biological
systems,

1531
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:54,540
we know that your motivational systems 
are disparate,

1532
01:21:54,930 --> 01:21:57,960
right?
They don't seem to unite themselves into

1533
01:21:57,961 --> 01:21:58,794
a single motivational system except 
maybe at the level of the reticular 

1534
01:22:02,941 --> 01:22:05,550
activating system,
which is something like general arousal.

1535
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:09,360
So Freud's wrong about that.
So,

1536
01:22:09,361 --> 01:22:12,410
but he was wrong in an interesting way 
and I don't think he was an idiot log.

1537
01:22:12,450 --> 01:22:13,283
But the point is is that there are,
there are multiple forms of meaning and 

1538
01:22:16,591 --> 01:22:20,130
motivation and their implicit and they 
have to be organized.

1539
01:22:20,131 --> 01:22:22,530
And so then the question is how do you 
organize them?

1540
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:23,393
Now,
if you have a conspiracy theory of 

1541
01:22:27,181 --> 01:22:29,700
history,
like the Marxists for example,

1542
01:22:29,701 --> 01:22:30,534
or maybe like Freud even because he 
thought religion was only a defense 

1543
01:22:33,211 --> 01:22:34,044
against death anxiety,
then what you basically propose is that 

1544
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:40,013
the structures of society,
our rules first and that the rules were 

1545
01:22:44,611 --> 01:22:49,530
imposed on the society by either someone
or some group of people or something.

1546
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:51,990
So for Marx,
when he's talking about religion,

1547
01:22:51,991 --> 01:22:53,850
he says religion is the opiate of the 
people.

1548
01:22:53,851 --> 01:22:55,890
And the reason that religion,
religion,

1549
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:56,813
allies itself with the capitalist 
interests because it allows people to 

1550
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:03,420
justify their misery and the hope of an 
eternal reward.

1551
01:23:03,421 --> 01:23:04,254
And so then they're not rattling up the 
whole economic system and the top guys 

1552
01:23:06,851 --> 01:23:09,100
can keep extracting value from them.
It's like,

1553
01:23:09,101 --> 01:23:12,910
yeah,
a bit,

1554
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,820
but not all.
Okay.

1555
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:16,953
Because there's a law part of Bar,
a lot of propositions about that that 

1556
01:23:19,211 --> 01:23:20,044
are wrong.
Like,

1557
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:21,063
and this is goes back to the chimps.
The chimps are out there and their 

1558
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:23,764
dominance hierarchy and they understand 
the hierarchy and they behave in 

1559
01:23:26,801 --> 01:23:27,634
accordance with it.
Are they following rules and answer to 

1560
01:23:30,161 --> 01:23:33,310
that is no,
they are not following rules.

1561
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:36,640
What they are doing is manifesting 
patterns of behavior.

1562
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:40,390
Now then you might think,
well did they think up those patterns of

1563
01:23:40,391 --> 01:23:41,224
behavior?

1564
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:42,333
And the answer to that is no,
they didn't think up those patterns of 

1565
01:23:45,221 --> 01:23:47,560
behavior.
So then the next question is,

1566
01:23:47,561 --> 01:23:49,750
cause they can't think,
not really.

1567
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:52,300
So.
So the next question is,

1568
01:23:52,301 --> 01:23:53,650
well,
if they didn't think the mop,

1569
01:23:53,651 --> 01:23:56,170
where the hell did they come from?
You know,

1570
01:23:56,171 --> 01:23:58,780
and it's,
it's very interesting question to ask of

1571
01:23:58,781 --> 01:24:01,000
a of a book,
like the Bible for example,

1572
01:24:01,001 --> 01:24:03,310
which is so well,
which is a bunch of books by the way.

1573
01:24:03,311 --> 01:24:04,144
Of course,
you know that it's extraordinarily old 

1574
01:24:05,681 --> 01:24:07,900
and it's been cobbled together over 
thousands of years.

1575
01:24:07,901 --> 01:24:10,420
It's like where did that come from?
Well,

1576
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:12,670
it's an extraordinarily complicated 
question.

1577
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,730
Obviously some people wrote it,
some other people edited,

1578
01:24:15,731 --> 01:24:16,564
some other people put it together.
A bunch of different people sequenced 

1579
01:24:18,701 --> 01:24:20,560
it.
It got modified over time.

1580
01:24:20,561 --> 01:24:24,970
It's full of cross references.
It's like it emerged roughly speaking.

1581
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:26,313
So,
and I can show you a very interesting 

1582
01:24:27,791 --> 01:24:30,280
visual demonstration of that later.
So yes,

1583
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:33,323
religion.

1584
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:37,050
Well,
it's late.

1585
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:39,810
I want to also explain what it's latent 
in.

1586
01:24:40,230 --> 01:24:45,230
That's because this is the real issue.
It's like if there's a,

1587
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:49,470
there's a claim that was basically 
brought forth in the late teenagers,

1588
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:50,333
late 18 hundreds it was formalized,
which is the systems that we use to 

1589
01:24:54,001 --> 01:24:58,080
govern our morality,
our arbitrary and predicated on belief.

1590
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:00,930
Right.
That was the proposition.

1591
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:02,453
So the question and that's how it all 
sorts of consequences and it's a 

1592
01:25:04,771 --> 01:25:07,290
powerful proposition.
The question is,

1593
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:09,780
is it a correct preposition?
So,

1594
01:25:10,290 --> 01:25:14,550
so here's a little diagram here.
So that's from Panksepp.

1595
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,080
Jaak,
Jaak,

1596
01:25:16,081 --> 01:25:18,040
Panksepp the two top ones,
little rats.

1597
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,590
Okay.
So we'll tell a story about rats.

1598
01:25:19,591 --> 01:25:24,591
This is quite cool.
So juvenile male rats are wired to play.

1599
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:28,110
Now rats are in general.
Okay.

1600
01:25:28,111 --> 01:25:30,750
Because rats have a place circuit.
It's a circuit.

1601
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:33,420
We have it to dogs.
Habit.

1602
01:25:33,450 --> 01:25:34,290
Mammals have it.

1603
01:25:34,290 --> 01:25:35,123
You know,
I went to the zoo the other day and I 

1604
01:25:36,211 --> 01:25:39,720
saw a rhinoceros playing.
Watch that for like 10 minutes.

1605
01:25:39,721 --> 01:25:44,550
It has this huge ball in its,
its compartment and the bloody thing was

1606
01:25:44,551 --> 01:25:45,384
like dancing around walloping this ball 
with its huge horn and like it was 

1607
01:25:48,871 --> 01:25:50,220
dancing,
it was playing.

1608
01:25:50,221 --> 01:25:54,420
It's like that was really cool.
Playful Rhinoceros,

1609
01:25:54,421 --> 01:25:55,254
you know,
you're out there and play soccer with 

1610
01:25:56,521 --> 01:25:58,530
it.
Of course you'd get crunched like in two

1611
01:25:58,531 --> 01:26:00,420
seconds flat.
Okay,

1612
01:26:00,450 --> 01:26:03,060
so play well,
why is that relevant?

1613
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:04,640
So here's,
here's a cool thing.

1614
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:06,890
I think this is like an earth shattering
discovery.

1615
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:09,470
Personally.
Panksepp is a very smart guy.

1616
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:14,530
So you take a juvenile rat and you put 
them in a an a player arena.

1617
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:16,153
Hey,
so he throw another juvenile rat in 

1618
01:26:17,331 --> 01:26:19,760
there and they wrestle around ames.
So then you separate them.

1619
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,430
Then the rat has figured out that that's
where he can play.

1620
01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:26,120
So the next thing you could do is figure
out whether or not that route we'll work

1621
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:27,770
to get into that arena.
Right?

1622
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:28,604
So like will it pull levers to get in 
there because then you can infer that 

1623
01:26:31,401 --> 01:26:32,234
the route would be happy to go in there 
cause otherwise he wouldn't be pulling 

1624
01:26:34,291 --> 01:26:35,124
the levers.
Right.

1625
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,640
Straight behaviorism.
Except they wouldn't say happy.

1626
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:42,260
It's like the rats pulling away.
Pop these out in a little play chambers.

1627
01:26:42,261 --> 01:26:46,310
So there's another rat there and let's 
say that route is 10% bigger.

1628
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:51,680
Now the rats rough and tumble play,
they wrestle just like kids wrestle.

1629
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:52,573
They wrestle weirdly enough,
they're wrestling around having a fine 

1630
01:26:55,521 --> 01:26:58,040
time of it.
And it's not aggression.

1631
01:26:59,330 --> 01:27:02,540
It's different than aggression and 
people can easily see the difference.

1632
01:27:02,541 --> 01:27:05,870
Just like you can tell the difference 
when you know my dog,

1633
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:06,933
I'll play with him,
like kind of grabbed his paws and he 

1634
01:27:08,811 --> 01:27:10,880
just goes like,
he just has a short circuit.

1635
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:11,713
He's growing,
his hair is up and he's trying to bite 

1636
01:27:13,641 --> 01:27:15,620
me.
But the only thing he ever does this hit

1637
01:27:15,621 --> 01:27:16,850
me with his teeth,
you know,

1638
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,130
and it's a game he knows that I'm 
supposed to be able to,

1639
01:27:19,131 --> 01:27:19,964
I'm trying to grab these for and he's 
trying to bite me and so we do this and 

1640
01:27:22,551 --> 01:27:24,530
it's like if you didn't know what was 
going on,

1641
01:27:24,531 --> 01:27:25,364
you'd think the dog was going to tear me
to pieces because it's roaring away and 

1642
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:28,813
you know,
and it's having a great time and I let 

1643
01:27:30,321 --> 01:27:31,154
it nail me now and then and but it's 
playing and now it's obvious that it's 

1644
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:38,030
playing and that's way different than it
being attacked by an angry dog.

1645
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:39,103
Okay.
So we know there's a difference between 

1646
01:27:39,981 --> 01:27:42,020
play aggression in real aggression.
So fine,

1647
01:27:42,410 --> 01:27:43,243
you get the rats out there.
Now if one wrap is 10% bigger than the 

1648
01:27:46,351 --> 01:27:48,860
other rat,
then that rat can win all the time.

1649
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:49,903
Cause it's an the weight differences 
enough and the size differences enough 

1650
01:27:52,161 --> 01:27:55,880
so that the big rock can just pin this 
small rat over and over and over.

1651
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:58,213
So you might think,
well what does a small rack think about 

1652
01:28:00,171 --> 01:28:01,640
that?
And the answer is,

1653
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:02,743
okay,
they go out there and they wrestle and 

1654
01:28:04,491 --> 01:28:06,920
the big rat establishes dominance.
He wins,

1655
01:28:06,921 --> 01:28:09,440
right?
So then you take them apart and then you

1656
01:28:09,441 --> 01:28:12,020
put them back together.
And what happens is that then the little

1657
01:28:12,021 --> 01:28:12,854
rat,
he's charged with inviting the big wrap 

1658
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:16,940
to play.
So that's his role now.

1659
01:28:16,941 --> 01:28:20,000
So it goes up and does whatever rat does
when it wants to play.

1660
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:22,640
Suspected does something like a dog does
when it wants to play.

1661
01:28:22,641 --> 01:28:25,370
Party puts its head down and sort of 
dances around.

1662
01:28:25,371 --> 01:28:26,130
You know,
it's like,

1663
01:28:26,130 --> 01:28:26,963
are you ready for this?
So then the big rat jumps on him and 

1664
01:28:29,391 --> 01:28:30,080
they roll around.

1665
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:35,080
And then what happens?
Well let's say you do that over and over

1666
01:28:35,211 --> 01:28:36,044
and over because that's the thing is 
that something that happens once is not 

1667
01:28:40,131 --> 01:28:42,560
the same thing as something that 
iterates across time.

1668
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:47,240
It's not the same thing.
So how rats play is,

1669
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:48,283
it's a completely different question if 
they play once or if they play a long 

1670
01:28:50,721 --> 01:28:53,330
time with the same partner cause and 
there's different rules.

1671
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:54,343
And so here's the emergent rule.
The little rat won't play with the big 

1672
01:28:57,141 --> 01:28:57,974
rat.
If the big rat doesn't let him win 30% 

1673
01:29:00,021 --> 01:29:00,854
of the time,
the big rat has to let the little rat 

1674
01:29:02,851 --> 01:29:06,540
win 30% of the time.
So I thought that's so cool.

1675
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:10,860
It's so cool because what you see there,
that's an emergent morality,

1676
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:11,991
right?
It's,

1677
01:29:11,991 --> 01:29:15,060
it's not codafide in rules,
but there's a,

1678
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:16,013
there's a procedural,
there's our social proposition that 

1679
01:29:17,941 --> 01:29:18,720
emerges there.

1680
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:19,553
And the social proposition is you got to
let the little guy win sometimes and 

1681
01:29:23,341 --> 01:29:24,510
even rats.
No,

1682
01:29:24,511 --> 01:29:26,220
that,
so,

1683
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:27,720
okay,
so that's not a rule.

1684
01:29:27,721 --> 01:29:30,180
It's not handed down on high,
so to speak.

1685
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:35,420
It's an emergent consequence of the 
interaction of two rats now.

1686
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:37,830
Okay.
So you might think,

1687
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:39,450
well there are some boys doing the same 
thing.

1688
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:41,670
Okay,
now Panksepp has always also found other

1689
01:29:41,671 --> 01:29:42,451
things.
So he's found,

1690
01:29:42,451 --> 01:29:43,284
for example,
that if you don't let rats play rough 

1691
01:29:45,841 --> 01:29:46,674
and tumble play in particular,
their prefrontal cortex is don't mature 

1692
01:29:51,690 --> 01:29:52,523
and they get hyperactive.
But you can treat that in routes with 

1693
01:29:55,171 --> 01:29:57,390
Ritalin,
right?

1694
01:29:58,290 --> 01:29:59,123
So you know Panksepp's hypothesis,
which I think is an extraordinarily 

1695
01:30:02,191 --> 01:30:03,024
credible hypothesis is that the reason 
boys in particular hyperactive is 

1696
01:30:06,061 --> 01:30:06,894
because they're not playing enough.
But you can fix that with Ritalin 

1697
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,290
instead of letting them play.
And what you do if you're gonna let them

1698
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:15,240
plays you,
you watched the man,

1699
01:30:15,241 --> 01:30:18,450
they're going to like play and sometimes
they're going to get a bit too rough and

1700
01:30:18,451 --> 01:30:19,290
then you stop them.

1701
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:20,730
You say like,
no,

1702
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:23,910
if you play like that,
the game won't continue.

1703
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:25,103
That's like a first part of moral rule.
You have to play each game in a manner 

1704
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,550
that lets the repetition of those games 
occur.

1705
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,400
And so that's why you would have to be a
good sport,

1706
01:30:35,401 --> 01:30:36,390
for example.
Right?

1707
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:37,710
Be a good sport.
Why?

1708
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:39,630
What if I can win?
Well,

1709
01:30:39,631 --> 01:30:40,464
the question is what does weird mean?
Does win mean you win this game or does 

1710
01:30:46,501 --> 01:30:47,334
win mean that you play this game in such
a way so that the probability that 

1711
01:30:50,311 --> 01:30:54,240
you'll get invited to play more and more
games as you mature increases.

1712
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:57,000
So it's two games at the same time,
right?

1713
01:30:57,690 --> 01:31:02,070
There's the game and the metagame and 
what you're telling a child when you say

1714
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:03,743
be a good sport is you're saying,
but you don't know this because you're 

1715
01:31:07,411 --> 01:31:08,244
not smart enough and you know what the 
hell do you know about Metta Games and 

1716
01:31:11,041 --> 01:31:12,000
so on and so forth.

1717
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,590
You say,
well be a good sport.

1718
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:14,670
Why?
Well,

1719
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:18,930
cause that's how to play properly.
Hollow explanation.

1720
01:31:19,260 --> 01:31:20,093
But the answer is something like,
well and maybe a parent will say this 

1721
01:31:23,401 --> 01:31:24,960
cause other kids won't want to play with
you.

1722
01:31:24,990 --> 01:31:26,430
You know that,
that that's a reason.

1723
01:31:26,490 --> 01:31:28,440
And that's getting somewhere with an 
explanation.

1724
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:30,720
You might have to say why and then you 
know,

1725
01:31:30,870 --> 01:31:34,020
you decompose it and the kid will 
probably know how to ask anyways.

1726
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:34,854
But,
but the point is is that there's a 

1727
01:31:37,441 --> 01:31:39,690
higher moral principle at stake.
And you might say,

1728
01:31:39,691 --> 01:31:40,524
well why is it higher?
Because one of the things he might ask 

1729
01:31:42,511 --> 01:31:43,344
yourself is,
are some moral propositions higher than 

1730
01:31:46,321 --> 01:31:48,180
other moral propositions?
Right.

1731
01:31:48,181 --> 01:31:51,840
Which is an anti relativist claim.
So it's,

1732
01:31:51,841 --> 01:31:53,760
it's,
there's only a binary answer to that.

1733
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:54,923
The answer is yes,
some values are higher than others or 

1734
01:31:57,331 --> 01:31:58,260
no,
they're not.

1735
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,320
No means the hierarchy is flat and it 
can't be organized.

1736
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:07,560
Yes means either that the ordering is 
arbitrary and tyrannical or that there's

1737
01:32:10,781 --> 01:32:11,614
an,
that there's some other process at work 

1738
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:14,103
that has a,
that that applies across wide ranges of 

1739
01:32:17,801 --> 01:32:20,380
contexts and situations.
Now,

1740
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:23,163
Thomas Kuhn,
who studied the structure of scientific 

1741
01:32:26,141 --> 01:32:28,730
revolutions,
he said his art,

1742
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:29,583
he,
he never really figured out whether he 

1743
01:32:30,551 --> 01:32:33,630
was a relativist or a phd and he was 
Kinda,

1744
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:36,963
okay,

1745
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:37,843
wishy washy on the topic.
Now what Kuhn basically said with 

1746
01:32:40,251 --> 01:32:41,084
something like

1747
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:44,233
science is a hierarchy and now and then 
a revolution takes place at the highest 

1748
01:32:46,581 --> 01:32:47,414
level of abstraction.
And usually that happens when there's a 

1749
01:32:50,121 --> 01:32:53,630
theory and it's being applied to explain
the world.

1750
01:32:53,780 --> 01:32:56,090
And there's an anomaly that it doesn't 
explain.

1751
01:32:56,330 --> 01:32:57,920
And for a while you can just ignore 
that.

1752
01:32:57,921 --> 01:32:58,754
And normally,
but then it gets more and more annoying 

1753
01:33:00,591 --> 01:33:04,850
and aggravating and takes full stage and
you can't explain it in.

1754
01:33:04,851 --> 01:33:08,300
That means there's something wrong with 
your damn theory and then poof,

1755
01:33:08,301 --> 01:33:12,950
someone comes along with another theory 
which explains that a normally now Kuvan

1756
01:33:12,951 --> 01:33:13,784
was never sure if the new theory was 
better than the old theory or what 

1757
01:33:17,091 --> 01:33:20,330
better meant or if it was just a 
replacement for the old theory,

1758
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:25,070
it was like to Olay didn't work.
Tool b works in this situation.

1759
01:33:25,790 --> 01:33:29,330
Now what Piaget said though was that 
when he was talking about revolutions of

1760
01:33:29,331 --> 01:33:31,550
the same type,
so that'd be the stage transformation.

1761
01:33:31,550 --> 01:33:31,971
He said,
no,

1762
01:33:31,971 --> 01:33:32,804
no,
no.

1763
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:34,303
There's a rule for better.
The rule is the new paradigm accounts 

1764
01:33:41,511 --> 01:33:42,344
for everything the other paradigm did.
Plus it accounts for some other things 

1765
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:47,473
and so why is it better?
While there's a definition of better 

1766
01:33:49,401 --> 01:33:50,234
that's implicit in that,
and so imagine that you knew something 

1767
01:33:52,521 --> 01:33:54,650
and it was only good one place at one 
time.

1768
01:33:54,830 --> 01:33:55,430
It's like,
great,

1769
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:56,263
that's a good thing.
Let's say you replace that with another 

1770
01:33:58,341 --> 01:34:01,280
thing you knew and it was good in three 
situations.

1771
01:34:01,281 --> 01:34:02,720
At three different times.
It's like,

1772
01:34:02,721 --> 01:34:04,040
well,
which of those are you going to use?

1773
01:34:04,070 --> 01:34:06,530
All other things being equal?
Wow.

1774
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:09,200
Why not use the one that works in more 
situations?

1775
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:10,550
And so we could say,
well,

1776
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,930
our moral principle is super ordinate to
another moral principle.

1777
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:15,943
If the superordinate principle works to 
facilitate the same man's across longer 

1778
01:34:22,251 --> 01:34:26,570
spans of time with more people.

1779
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:28,850
So then the question is,
well,

1780
01:34:28,851 --> 01:34:29,684
how should you play a game?
And the answer is what are you doing 

1781
01:34:32,811 --> 01:34:33,644
while you're playing a game?
And one answer is you're trying to win 

1782
01:34:36,141 --> 01:34:38,780
that game in other answers,
you're trying to play that game.

1783
01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:39,883
Another answer is you're engaged in 
practicing emotive playing that will 

1784
01:34:43,101 --> 01:34:46,130
enable you to play many games in many 
situations successfully.

1785
01:34:46,490 --> 01:34:47,323
It's like,
okay,

1786
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:49,190
which of those is most important?
Well,

1787
01:34:49,191 --> 01:34:50,750
it's obvious,
which is most important.

1788
01:34:51,230 --> 01:34:55,220
If the game is worthwhile,
which is what you propose.

1789
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:57,860
If you play it,
you've agreed to that.

1790
01:34:58,670 --> 01:34:59,503
Then obviously playing in a way that 
enables you to play more games of that 

1791
01:35:02,391 --> 01:35:03,224
type better is better end of problem.
So now you can think that through and 

1792
01:35:08,121 --> 01:35:09,860
see if there's any flaws in the logic.
But,

1793
01:35:13,210 --> 01:35:14,043
but people have been thinking about it 
for about a hundred years and I think 

1794
01:35:16,061 --> 01:35:20,350
that's about as far as it's got and I,
I can't see up off whole in that.

1795
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:22,360
So.
All right,

1796
01:35:22,361 --> 01:35:25,030
so the boys are playing now you make me 
think,

1797
01:35:25,031 --> 01:35:27,370
what are they doing when they're playing
rough and tumble play.

1798
01:35:27,670 --> 01:35:28,503
Okay.
So now I have played with kids that 

1799
01:35:29,621 --> 01:35:30,454
haven't had any rough and tumble play 
and it's really hard to play with them 

1800
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:37,360
partly because they're there,
they're easily frightened,

1801
01:35:37,630 --> 01:35:38,830
you know,
they'd like to play.

1802
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:41,470
I know how to play with kids,
they'd liked to play.

1803
01:35:41,471 --> 01:35:43,030
They're pretty hepped up on it,
you know,

1804
01:35:43,031 --> 01:35:44,470
and they,
they really excited,

1805
01:35:44,471 --> 01:35:47,920
especially about physical play,
but they're awkward,

1806
01:35:47,921 --> 01:35:49,000
you know,
so you play with them,

1807
01:35:49,001 --> 01:35:51,460
they stick their thumb in your eye or 
you know,

1808
01:35:51,461 --> 01:35:52,294
or they cry really easily when nothing 
really happens and like they just don't 

1809
01:35:56,201 --> 01:35:57,370
have it together.

1810
01:35:58,180 --> 01:36:01,210
A kid that has done a lot of physical 
interaction,

1811
01:36:01,211 --> 01:36:03,550
physical play,
that kid,

1812
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:06,460
it's a different sort of kid because the
first thing the kid knows,

1813
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:07,383
it's not a rule.
The first thing the kid knows is how 

1814
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:12,093
forceful can he be with you.
So that it's exciting and interesting 

1815
01:36:15,911 --> 01:36:18,280
and fun,
but it's not too much.

1816
01:36:18,370 --> 01:36:22,360
And that's really an interesting 
question name because actually to really

1817
01:36:22,361 --> 01:36:25,240
play a good game,
like a physical contact game,

1818
01:36:25,241 --> 01:36:26,074
like wrestling with a kid is that you 
want to let that kid come right up to 

1819
01:36:29,621 --> 01:36:33,340
the edge of hurting you.
And the closer the kid gets to the edge,

1820
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:36,130
the more fun it is for both because the 
kid will give you a whack and go,

1821
01:36:36,430 --> 01:36:37,840
he,
you know,

1822
01:36:38,050 --> 01:36:38,940
and,
and that's,

1823
01:36:38,941 --> 01:36:39,761
it's good,
you know?

1824
01:36:39,761 --> 01:36:42,340
And then maybe he'll give you a harder 
whack to see if he can get away with it.

1825
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:44,050
And kids will often,
they'll come up to you,

1826
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:47,740
whack you and then run away and then 
they'll look and if you're laughing then

1827
01:36:47,741 --> 01:36:49,450
they'll come back and try a harder one.
And then,

1828
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:50,433
you know,
they're doing it incrementally because 

1829
01:36:51,671 --> 01:36:54,880
it's exploratory behavior.
And part of the exploration is,

1830
01:36:55,150 --> 01:36:58,120
okay,
what our bodies like.

1831
01:36:58,970 --> 01:37:02,770
And the answer that is,
well what can you get away with doing to

1832
01:37:02,771 --> 01:37:03,604
them?
But it's a more sophisticated answer to 

1833
01:37:05,411 --> 01:37:06,244
which is what can you get away with 
doing to them in a way that allows you 

1834
01:37:10,391 --> 01:37:15,391
to continue to explore without fear or 
punishment and without blowing the whole

1835
01:37:15,671 --> 01:37:17,050
game to bits.
Okay,

1836
01:37:17,051 --> 01:37:17,884
so how do you figure that out?
You do not talk about it cause you 

1837
01:37:21,071 --> 01:37:22,870
can't.
You have to act it out.

1838
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:26,200
It's like so.
So the kids hitting you in wrestling and

1839
01:37:26,201 --> 01:37:29,230
pulling your hair and doing all these 
things and you're modifying its behavior

1840
01:37:29,231 --> 01:37:30,490
very,
very carefully and,

1841
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:33,040
and,
and in my minuscule detail.

1842
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:36,130
And then you get a kid who can like 
wrestle like mad and they're fun to play

1843
01:37:36,131 --> 01:37:38,060
with.
They bounced around like a dog that will

1844
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:41,110
bite you.
You know a good well trained dog you can

1845
01:37:41,111 --> 01:37:44,380
really play with and you can play with 
them rough and it's a blast.

1846
01:37:44,381 --> 01:37:46,510
The dog has a good time,
the person has a good time.

1847
01:37:46,511 --> 01:37:49,030
It's like excellent.
That's a socialized dog.

1848
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:50,313
So

1849
01:37:51,810 --> 01:37:54,510
the other thing that kids learn learns,
which is quite cool,

1850
01:37:54,511 --> 01:37:55,344
is what hurts them and what doesn't and 
how afraid can they be and still have 

1851
01:38:00,241 --> 01:38:01,770
fun.
So,

1852
01:38:01,771 --> 01:38:03,630
you know,
when you're wrestling with the kid,

1853
01:38:03,631 --> 01:38:04,560
you've put them,
you know,

1854
01:38:04,561 --> 01:38:07,030
you put them face down,
you put your elbow on Mia,

1855
01:38:07,450 --> 01:38:08,283
bend them around,
you throw them in the air and catch 

1856
01:38:09,901 --> 01:38:10,740
them.
You know,

1857
01:38:10,741 --> 01:38:13,590
you've grabbed her by the leg and maybe 
you pull them over and you know,

1858
01:38:13,591 --> 01:38:14,424
and what you're showing the kid is 
here's a bunch of things that your body 

1859
01:38:17,011 --> 01:38:19,170
can do.
And it's okay that they're,

1860
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:20,093
they're being done,
that it isn't going to hurt you and 

1861
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:24,480
you're not talking about you're showing 
them.

1862
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:25,583
And so the kid gets kind of confident 
about what he or she can withstand 

1863
01:38:30,721 --> 01:38:31,554
physically.
And the difference between pain and not 

1864
01:38:34,561 --> 01:38:35,394
pain.
And the difference between fear and not 

1865
01:38:37,981 --> 01:38:38,310
fear.

1866
01:38:38,310 --> 01:38:41,940
And when something's threatening and 
when it's not very sophisticated,

1867
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:46,800
it's very sophisticated behave.
And that's partly why kids love to play.

1868
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:48,570
Now,
one of the things that's happened,

1869
01:38:48,571 --> 01:38:49,404
which is,
you know,

1870
01:38:49,410 --> 01:38:50,243
an indication of a deep sickness in our 
society is that I used to work in a 

1871
01:38:53,911 --> 01:38:58,530
daycare center right when I was about 
your age because I really liked kids and

1872
01:38:58,531 --> 01:39:00,840
they like to play with me because I know
how to play with them.

1873
01:39:00,841 --> 01:39:01,674
And so one of the things I would do with
the little kids was I would draw them 

1874
01:39:04,861 --> 01:39:06,330
horrible monsters,
right?

1875
01:39:06,331 --> 01:39:09,210
Like big teeth things on,
I just sketched them out.

1876
01:39:09,211 --> 01:39:10,560
They weren't any works of art,
you know.

1877
01:39:10,561 --> 01:39:13,230
But those damn kids,
they would line up to get a picture of a

1878
01:39:13,231 --> 01:39:15,180
monster,
draw me a picture of the monster,

1879
01:39:15,181 --> 01:39:16,014
draw me a picture of a monster.
It's like they love those little 

1880
01:39:17,731 --> 01:39:18,780
pictures of monsters.

1881
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:19,993
So then I was pretty funny.
And the other thing I would do is play 

1882
01:39:21,961 --> 01:39:22,651
with them.
You know,

1883
01:39:22,651 --> 01:39:23,484
I'd take him out in the yard and grab an
arm and a leg and spin them around and 

1884
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:29,180
bend them over and you know,
twist them around,

1885
01:39:29,190 --> 01:39:30,390
let them crawl on me.
And,

1886
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:31,753
um,
there's always one kid in the group who 

1887
01:39:33,931 --> 01:39:35,160
couldn't do that though.
And he's like,

1888
01:39:35,850 --> 01:39:37,770
he hadn't been paid attention to enough,
you know,

1889
01:39:37,771 --> 01:39:38,604
so he was,
I think he's like a Taoist uncarved 

1890
01:39:40,561 --> 01:39:41,394
block,
very vague and ill defined and clunky 

1891
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,890
and so kid like that,
you know,

1892
01:39:46,950 --> 01:39:47,783
you'd sit down,
it's so sad you sit down and you're 

1893
01:39:49,921 --> 01:39:53,100
interacting with the kids and that kid 
comes along sort of lumping along,

1894
01:39:53,101 --> 01:39:56,670
you know,
like this and they plop plop on your lap

1895
01:39:56,671 --> 01:39:59,490
and they like,
they're about as sophisticated as like a

1896
01:39:59,491 --> 01:40:00,690
six month old,
you know,

1897
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:02,730
and they're quite annoying,
you know,

1898
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:03,593
which is a horrible thing because 
they're so desperate for attention and 

1899
01:40:05,971 --> 01:40:06,600
it's too late.

1900
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:08,400
Often by the time they're four,
it's like,

1901
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:11,370
good luck fixing that man.
It's not going to happen.

1902
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:12,533
You know?
And those kids are just screwed because 

1903
01:40:14,071 --> 01:40:17,250
what happens to them is they're so lumpy
and ill formed and,

1904
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:18,353
and uncomfortable in their body and 
socially clueless and inattentive and 

1905
01:40:21,421 --> 01:40:25,920
blind and ignored and resentful that no 
other kids would play with them.

1906
01:40:26,690 --> 01:40:27,523
And it's no wonder because the other 
kids are way the hell up on the play 

1907
01:40:29,910 --> 01:40:32,820
development trend.
And so their board staffed by them,

1908
01:40:33,090 --> 01:40:36,150
it's like playing with a nine month old,
which kids will do,

1909
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:38,760
you know?
But that's not pure play.

1910
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:42,480
And so those kids just drift off.
They get,

1911
01:40:42,481 --> 01:40:45,840
they stay on the outside of the peer 
group and they never get into it.

1912
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:49,560
They never get into it.
So very,

1913
01:40:49,561 --> 01:40:51,690
very ugly.
And so now in daycare centers,

1914
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:54,220
you can't touch the kids.
It's like,

1915
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:56,920
what the hell?
You know?

1916
01:40:56,921 --> 01:40:57,700
Well,
why?

1917
01:40:57,700 --> 01:40:58,533
Well,
because he can't distinguish play for 

1918
01:40:59,621 --> 01:41:01,870
molesting.
It's like who can't distinguish that?

1919
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:03,880
You know?
And what are you going to do?

1920
01:41:03,881 --> 01:41:06,910
You're not going to hear,
you're going to deprive the kids of play

1921
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:09,940
because of your stupid paranoia.
That's the whole,

1922
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,680
that's the whole process.
Right.

1923
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:13,690
Brilliant,
brilliant.

1924
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:15,333
You know what you're doing is you're 
teaching children that adults are so 

1925
01:41:18,281 --> 01:41:20,620
dangerous that they can't be trusted to 
be near you.

1926
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:21,843
That's a lovely thing to teach children,
especially because they're gonna be 

1927
01:41:23,831 --> 01:41:25,270
adults.
Yeah.

1928
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:36,613
I don't think it's competent Satori.
I think it's a different level of 

1929
01:41:39,411 --> 01:41:42,020
abstraction.
So we're going to talk about that next.

1930
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:46,700
Okay.
So the rats even routes need play,

1931
01:41:46,701 --> 01:41:47,534
right?
And that's are smart enough to figure 

1932
01:41:48,441 --> 01:41:50,270
out that the little guy has to win 
sometimes.

1933
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:51,433
So,

1934
01:41:54,030 --> 01:41:54,863
okay,

1935
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:59,420
here's what happens with chimps.
This is quite cool.

1936
01:41:59,421 --> 01:42:03,410
So the little male chimps in particular,
because chimps are very aggressive,

1937
01:42:03,710 --> 01:42:07,910
they do a lot of playing and one of the 
things they do is tease the older males.

1938
01:42:07,911 --> 01:42:11,810
So maybe the older males like having a 
snooze under a tree and like the,

1939
01:42:12,130 --> 01:42:12,963
uh,
the young chimps have come up and like 

1940
01:42:13,970 --> 01:42:17,720
poking with a stick or tickle them or 
poke them and runaway and so,

1941
01:42:18,350 --> 01:42:20,330
and they're trying to see what they can 
get away with.

1942
01:42:20,690 --> 01:42:21,523
And that's dominance,
hierarchy challenge in its childhood 

1943
01:42:23,031 --> 01:42:23,864
form.
And it can be a game if it's done 

1944
01:42:24,681 --> 01:42:25,790
properly.
It's a gate.

1945
01:42:26,090 --> 01:42:26,923
If it's not done properly,
it's insubordination and its aggression 

1946
01:42:29,690 --> 01:42:31,190
and then something's actually gone 
wrong.

1947
01:42:31,490 --> 01:42:32,990
I'll get,
I'll tell you a story about that.

1948
01:42:32,991 --> 01:42:37,790
So one time I was in Montreal and I 
lived in a pretty poor area of Montreal.

1949
01:42:38,170 --> 01:42:40,190
Um,
and it was like a historically poor,

1950
01:42:40,191 --> 01:42:41,024
it wasn't a slum or anything,
but it was a very on the low end of the 

1951
01:42:45,601 --> 01:42:48,660
working class neighborhoods.
So and uh,

1952
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:52,153
cross the alley about two houses down 
there was this house where things 

1953
01:42:55,411 --> 01:42:56,880
weren't going on that we're good,
you know,

1954
01:42:56,881 --> 01:42:58,890
I don't know if it was a crack house or 
some damn thing,

1955
01:42:58,891 --> 01:42:59,724
but there were people in and out of it 
all the time and there was a lot of 

1956
01:43:01,981 --> 01:43:04,530
drinking beer and which is fine,
but it was like,

1957
01:43:04,770 --> 01:43:06,480
it was like antisocial,
you know,

1958
01:43:06,481 --> 01:43:08,250
it wasn't,
it wasn't fun party.

1959
01:43:08,251 --> 01:43:09,660
It was like,
you know,

1960
01:43:11,070 --> 01:43:13,860
corrupt biker Weirdos and all sorts of 
things.

1961
01:43:13,861 --> 01:43:14,694
And there was a little kid there,
he was about three and I could kind of 

1962
01:43:18,001 --> 01:43:20,190
kept an eye on that kid and he was an 
unhappy kid.

1963
01:43:20,191 --> 01:43:22,680
Like he was already,
he had a contempt,

1964
01:43:22,681 --> 01:43:24,900
resentment face pretty well developed 
already.

1965
01:43:25,230 --> 01:43:29,730
And so one day I was out in the back 
alley and I was building this fence.

1966
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:31,320
You guys are going to fence in my yard 
in.

1967
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:32,153
And so then this little kid came up and 
he came up with a bunch of his little 

1968
01:43:34,801 --> 01:43:35,700
cronies,
you know,

1969
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,770
and uh,
I was watching them,

1970
01:43:37,771 --> 01:43:39,960
they're watching me with like hatred,
I would say,

1971
01:43:39,961 --> 01:43:41,880
basically.
And uh,

1972
01:43:42,510 --> 01:43:43,343
you know,
so I was looking at one of the kids and 

1973
01:43:44,401 --> 01:43:46,890
they were watching me hammer and I 
motioned to the kid,

1974
01:43:46,891 --> 01:43:47,724
I said,
do you want to,

1975
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:51,500
I couldn't speak to him cause he spoke 
cave quad and it was like [inaudible],

1976
01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:53,930
which I can't speak French very well at 
all.

1977
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:55,660
And jewel,
the real is ul.

1978
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:56,690
It's like,
no,

1979
01:43:56,691 --> 01:43:58,940
I can't even hear what the hell that is.
You know.

1980
01:43:58,941 --> 01:44:00,360
So,
um,

1981
01:44:01,450 --> 01:44:02,780
I,
I motioned to the kid,

1982
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:04,370
you know,
you want a hammer.

1983
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:06,920
And so he comes up and he,
he said in French,

1984
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:10,940
I'm going to steal this and I,
so he was tugging on it and I thought,

1985
01:44:11,210 --> 01:44:12,080
well that's pretty weird.

1986
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:14,870
So if he was looking at me mad,
he's going to take this,

1987
01:44:14,871 --> 01:44:15,950
he said,
I'm stealing this.

1988
01:44:16,290 --> 01:44:16,791
Well,
no,

1989
01:44:16,791 --> 01:44:18,410
I'm not going to give it to you if 
you're going to steal it.

1990
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:19,970
So,
so that was fine.

1991
01:44:19,971 --> 01:44:22,060
So I said no,
and I kept hammering.

1992
01:44:22,070 --> 01:44:22,903
They were all watching and then he 
stepped about 15 feet back and he ran 

1993
01:44:30,561 --> 01:44:33,740
right over the fence,
like running on it,

1994
01:44:33,741 --> 01:44:34,580
you know?
And I thought,

1995
01:44:34,581 --> 01:44:35,960
wow,
that's pretty damn interesting.

1996
01:44:35,961 --> 01:44:37,880
It's like,
that's a lot of golf or a three year old

1997
01:44:37,881 --> 01:44:38,714
kid,
you know?

1998
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:40,250
It's like,
but it was provocative,

1999
01:44:40,251 --> 01:44:41,084
right?
It was dominance provocation and it 

2000
01:44:43,131 --> 01:44:45,230
wasn't a game because he didn't know how
to play a game.

2001
01:44:45,470 --> 01:44:48,560
He didn't know how to play a game.
He just knew like outright aggression.

2002
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:51,380
So he ran over this fence and then he 
stood there and looked at me,

2003
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:52,580
you know?

2004
01:44:52,580 --> 01:44:56,030
And well,
I don't remember exactly what I did.

2005
01:44:56,031 --> 01:44:57,590
Nothing.
I think I was just watching him.

2006
01:44:57,591 --> 01:44:59,360
I eventually finished the fence and put 
it away,

2007
01:44:59,361 --> 01:45:00,194
but I thought that kids headed for 
prison just as certainly as as a rock 

2008
01:45:03,501 --> 01:45:04,700
falls to earth.
It's like,

2009
01:45:04,730 --> 01:45:08,690
and I know the antisocial literature,
it's like if you're antisocial at four,

2010
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:10,363
good luck to you.
There isn't much that can be done about 

2011
01:45:12,081 --> 01:45:12,914
it.
He was so ruined by that point already 

2012
01:45:13,941 --> 01:45:15,230
that there was,
you know,

2013
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:19,400
it would have taken me if I would have 
access to that kid,

2014
01:45:19,430 --> 01:45:20,263
I probably would had to fight with him 
nonstop for three months to straighten 

2015
01:45:25,281 --> 01:45:27,050
him out.
And it wouldn't have been pretty,

2016
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:28,850
you know,
because he was already,

2017
01:45:28,851 --> 01:45:29,684
he hated adults already and they didn't,
he thought they were contemptible and 

2018
01:45:33,051 --> 01:45:33,884
useless and that he could prevail over 
them and that they were erratic and you 

2019
01:45:36,231 --> 01:45:39,290
couldn't trust them to punish or reward 
or to pay attention.

2020
01:45:39,291 --> 01:45:42,170
And there was no such thing as real 
social rules and you know,

2021
01:45:42,171 --> 01:45:44,090
power dominated everything.
It's like,

2022
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:45,800
and that was all in him,
right?

2023
01:45:45,801 --> 01:45:46,790
It was built into them.

2024
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:52,550
They were mostly watching,
you know,

2025
01:45:52,730 --> 01:45:53,563
so,
and I don't know what sort of peer 

2026
01:45:54,441 --> 01:45:56,390
interactions they would have had,
you know,

2027
01:45:56,510 --> 01:45:57,343
but as far as I could tell,
because sometimes the more aggressive 

2028
01:46:00,921 --> 01:46:01,754
guys,
they do form gangs and the gang is 

2029
01:46:03,441 --> 01:46:05,690
actually there.
It's a functional unit.

2030
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:08,300
There is some social interaction only 
within the gang.

2031
01:46:08,301 --> 01:46:09,134
Generally it's like a tribe.
So those are the more socialized 

2032
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:16,980
antisocial guys,
but some of the kids are so antisocial,

2033
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,500
they can't even work with it.
A gang.

2034
01:46:18,501 --> 01:46:20,750
So I don't know exactly where he was on 
the spectrum,

2035
01:46:21,230 --> 01:46:23,180
but um,
like his behavior was,

2036
01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:24,750
it was already criminal,
you know,

2037
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:28,040
it was just kid criminal,
same thing.

2038
01:46:28,430 --> 01:46:29,990
So,
okay.

2039
01:46:30,170 --> 01:46:33,320
So some things I should tell you about 
chimps too,

2040
01:46:33,321 --> 01:46:34,154
you know,
so you kind of think of the top chimp 

2041
01:46:35,210 --> 01:46:36,620
like a cave man,
you know,

2042
01:46:36,621 --> 01:46:38,480
the tough caveman with a big club.

2043
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:41,630
And so it's the tough chimp that 
dominates the hierarchy and it's sort of

2044
01:46:41,631 --> 01:46:45,410
like the tyranny theory of male 
dominance hierarchies.

2045
01:46:45,411 --> 01:46:47,690
It's the strongest,
meanest chimp that wins.

2046
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:51,900
Frans de Waal has been studying chimps 
for a long time and he's found it.

2047
01:46:51,901 --> 01:46:53,490
That's,
that's just not true.

2048
01:46:53,610 --> 01:46:55,980
What he found was what piaget would 
suggest,

2049
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:56,873
which is that the chimps that only use 
aggression and dominance form 

2050
01:47:00,931 --> 01:47:04,050
hierarchies that are unstable and prone 
to revolution.

2051
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:06,360
So he tells one story,
for example,

2052
01:47:06,361 --> 01:47:08,480
of this chimp that climb to the top.
This was,

2053
01:47:08,550 --> 01:47:12,390
I believe in the Arnhem Zoo and he was 
like brutal champ.

2054
01:47:12,391 --> 01:47:14,420
And he was a big tough guy,
you know,

2055
01:47:14,730 --> 01:47:19,590
but he wasn't very good at consolidating
his social relationships,

2056
01:47:19,591 --> 01:47:22,710
say with other male chimps or with the 
females.

2057
01:47:23,190 --> 01:47:24,870
So cause he was too brutal for any of 
that.

2058
01:47:24,871 --> 01:47:25,704
So we didn't engage in a lot of mutual 
grooming say with other males because 

2059
01:47:28,231 --> 01:47:31,710
one of the things you see in the chimps 
is the chimp males fight a lot,

2060
01:47:32,130 --> 01:47:34,530
but they also groom each other a lot.

2061
01:47:34,530 --> 01:47:35,520
So their,
their,

2062
01:47:35,550 --> 01:47:38,190
their relationship is more fractious and
aggression,

2063
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:41,400
aggressive and also more cooperative.
So that's quite cool.

2064
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,353
But he had forgotten most of that.
He didn't pay much attention to the 

2065
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:46,950
females.
So what happened was that the two second

2066
01:47:46,951 --> 01:47:49,590
order chimps jumped in one day and torn 
to bits.

2067
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:53,310
So that was the end of that.
And it was brutal,

2068
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:54,330
brutal,
brutal.

2069
01:47:54,331 --> 01:47:56,130
I think they castrated them with their 
teeth,

2070
01:47:56,131 --> 01:47:58,290
if I remember correctly.
And torn to shreds.

2071
01:47:58,650 --> 01:47:59,483
You know,
the rest of the troop was really 

2072
01:48:00,091 --> 01:48:03,090
agitated by this and agitated for a long
time afterwards.

2073
01:48:03,091 --> 01:48:05,040
But,
and chimps are brutal.

2074
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:06,353
Like they'll catch colobus monkeys and 
they eat them alive and the things are 

2075
01:48:08,971 --> 01:48:12,150
screaming away like,
and they're unbelievably strong.

2076
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:15,270
Like a chimp is about six times as 
strong as a grown man.

2077
01:48:15,690 --> 01:48:18,870
And so you get near a champ,
boy do not get near a chimp.

2078
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:23,400
Those things can break 300 pound tests,
steel cables with their hands.

2079
01:48:23,610 --> 01:48:26,130
They are super strong and they're 
vicious.

2080
01:48:26,310 --> 01:48:27,143
They're vicious.
So in a lot of what seems to inhibit 

2081
01:48:29,191 --> 01:48:32,250
chimp aggression is actually the 
dominance hierarchy.

2082
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:35,550
It's not clear that they have any limits
on their aggression internally.

2083
01:48:36,090 --> 01:48:37,950
So,
and so chimps will,

2084
01:48:37,951 --> 01:48:38,784
the male juvenile sometimes in the 
company of females will sort of patrol 

2085
01:48:42,241 --> 01:48:43,074
the edges of their territory.
And if they come across a chimp from a 

2086
01:48:46,231 --> 01:48:47,064
different troop and they outnumber them,
they'll attack them and tear them to 

2087
01:48:50,011 --> 01:48:53,430
shreds.
So that was discovered.

2088
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:56,130
I think Jane Goodall discovered that 
first.

2089
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:57,593
And she was shocked by it because she 
was still kind of operating under Russo 

2090
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:03,270
Soliah and assumptions.
And then for a long time she thought,

2091
01:49:03,271 --> 01:49:04,104
well maybe these,
maybe I've corrupted these chimps by 

2092
01:49:05,821 --> 01:49:08,850
feeding them and messing about a bit 
with their natural order.

2093
01:49:08,850 --> 01:49:12,480
And so maybe that's just a consequence 
of pathological human interaction.

2094
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:16,620
But then other chimp researchers 
reported the same sort of thing.

2095
01:49:16,621 --> 01:49:17,454
And so that's really interesting because
it means that chimps do territorial 

2096
01:49:20,191 --> 01:49:21,024
rating.
And so that also means that while one 

2097
01:49:23,281 --> 01:49:24,270
thing it means,
for example,

2098
01:49:24,271 --> 01:49:26,880
is religion is not the cause of wars.
You know,

2099
01:49:26,881 --> 01:49:28,440
when you might think,
well that's quite a leap.

2100
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:29,011
It's like,
no,

2101
01:49:29,011 --> 01:49:32,700
it's not quite elite.
Tribalism might be the cause of wars and

2102
01:49:32,701 --> 01:49:36,750
religion might be a form of tribalism.
But chimps basically engage in,

2103
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:37,733
cause I wore like behavior.
And you're not going to lay that at the 

2104
01:49:40,141 --> 01:49:44,310
hands of any abstract conceptual system.
It's territorial protection.

2105
01:49:44,970 --> 01:49:46,080
So,
all right.

2106
01:49:46,350 --> 01:49:51,350
So what do all found instead?
Was that the chimps who come to the top,

2107
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:55,900
who managed to stay there?
Our chimps who are,

2108
01:49:56,170 --> 01:49:59,500
they're strong for sure,
but they're also,

2109
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:00,723
um,
they also engage in a lot of mutual 

2110
01:50:02,771 --> 01:50:06,160
social interactions and they pay a lot 
of attention to the females.

2111
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:09,280
And so what it appears to be the case is
that,

2112
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:11,680
and this is so cool.
It's so cool.

2113
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:13,190
Yeah.

2114
01:50:13,190 --> 01:50:17,780
If you want to be king of the chimps,
you have to be a good king.

2115
01:50:18,430 --> 01:50:19,041
And you might say,
well,

2116
01:50:19,041 --> 01:50:21,260
what does good mean?
Cause that's an,

2117
01:50:21,290 --> 01:50:23,210
you think of that as a moral 
abstraction.

2118
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:24,830
What does good mean?
Good,

2119
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:26,450
good king.
Okay,

2120
01:50:27,470 --> 01:50:28,303
let's figure it out.
Being torn to bits in a violent 

2121
01:50:33,011 --> 01:50:36,490
insurrection seems like failure.
Okay.

2122
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:38,770
So,
um,

2123
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:39,993
being constantly hounded from all sides 
because you're to Roston not social 

2124
01:50:45,041 --> 01:50:45,874
enough,
that doesn't seem like an optimal 

2125
01:50:47,201 --> 01:50:48,034
solution.

2126
01:50:49,880 --> 01:50:53,510
Maintaining order in the hierarchy.
So the hierarchy maintains its structure

2127
01:50:53,511 --> 01:50:54,344
across time and so that everybody's 
attended to properly decreases the 

2128
01:50:58,011 --> 01:51:00,260
probability of violent insurrection a 
lot.

2129
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:02,090
So you might think,
well,

2130
01:51:02,091 --> 01:51:02,924
what the chimp is trying to do,
the chimp at the top is trying to 

2131
01:51:05,241 --> 01:51:06,074
structure the dominance hierarchy in 
such a way that it can maintain itself 

2132
01:51:08,541 --> 01:51:13,130
without violence in a productive manner 
with many individuals across large spans

2133
01:51:13,131 --> 01:51:16,910
of time.
Now there's nothing abstract about that.

2134
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:17,780
Now you might say,
well,

2135
01:51:17,781 --> 01:51:19,880
there may be different ways to do that.
It's like,

2136
01:51:19,881 --> 01:51:20,361
fine.
Yeah,

2137
01:51:20,361 --> 01:51:21,194
there probably are.
Just like you can be a plumber or you 

2138
01:51:23,061 --> 01:51:24,710
can be a lawyer.
You know there's men,

2139
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:28,640
there are different ways potentially of 
solving that set of problems,

2140
01:51:29,030 --> 01:51:33,230
but it's within a bounded universe.
There are things you can't do.

2141
01:51:33,290 --> 01:51:34,123
There may be many things you can do,
but there's certainly things that you 

2142
01:51:35,871 --> 01:51:36,704
can't do.

2143
01:51:37,190 --> 01:51:38,023
Okay,
so then that's really useful to know 

2144
01:51:39,111 --> 01:51:39,944
because what we can surmise from that 
potentially is that even higher order 

2145
01:51:43,851 --> 01:51:44,684
morality is something that emerges.
It emerges as a consequence of social 

2146
01:51:49,011 --> 01:51:53,540
interactions between motivated beings 
across large spans of time.

2147
01:51:53,541 --> 01:51:55,280
And that there's actually a pattern to 
that.

2148
01:51:55,820 --> 01:51:56,653
There's a pattern.
So that would be the pattern that 

2149
01:51:58,041 --> 01:52:03,041
characterizes the stable hierarch.
So now what is that pattern?

2150
01:52:04,130 --> 01:52:04,963
That's where you get to mythology.
So because this is where people differ 

2151
01:52:09,171 --> 01:52:10,550
from,
from chimps,

2152
01:52:10,610 --> 01:52:13,790
so obvious.
So you might say,

2153
01:52:13,791 --> 01:52:15,560
well why did the chimps act the way they
did?

2154
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:16,730
D Dupe.
And you might say,

2155
01:52:16,731 --> 01:52:19,700
well that's because they're their 
parents acted that way.

2156
01:52:19,701 --> 01:52:20,534
And then you might say,
well that's because their parents acted 

2157
01:52:22,011 --> 01:52:22,844
that way.
And you can make that argument going as 

2158
01:52:24,501 --> 01:52:27,950
far back in time as you want.
And I already made it at one point going

2159
01:52:27,951 --> 01:52:29,600
all the way back to lobsters,
right?

2160
01:52:29,750 --> 01:52:32,270
400 million years.
That's a dominance hierarchy.

2161
01:52:32,660 --> 01:52:33,493
So how do behave in a dominance 
hierarchy is something that's been 

2162
01:52:37,431 --> 01:52:40,220
figured out across 400 million years of 
evolution.

2163
01:52:40,221 --> 01:52:43,220
At least now you can infer two things 
from that.

2164
01:52:43,730 --> 01:52:47,440
One is your adapted to a dominance 
hierarchy.

2165
01:52:47,450 --> 01:52:49,670
Cause that bloody thing is old.
So,

2166
01:52:50,150 --> 01:52:50,983
so you have literally the forces of 
selection have shaped you such that if 

2167
01:52:56,901 --> 01:52:59,450
you weren't able to function within a 
dominance hierarchy,

2168
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:00,433
you weren't going to survive.
Someone would kill you and you weren't 

2169
01:53:02,121 --> 01:53:04,100
going to meet.
Okay.

2170
01:53:04,101 --> 01:53:06,530
So you're prepared for the damn 
dominance hurt.

2171
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:07,933
Now,
the next thing is you can observe and 

2172
01:53:09,771 --> 01:53:10,604
transmit information across the 
hierarchy because it's a living thing 

2173
01:53:12,711 --> 01:53:15,800
that continues across time.
So it kind of has its own structure that

2174
01:53:15,801 --> 01:53:17,810
perpetuates itself across the 
generations.

2175
01:53:18,140 --> 01:53:19,700
So with the chimps,
for example,

2176
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:20,713
the status of a family is heritable.
Now we don't know if that's a 

2177
01:53:24,111 --> 01:53:27,710
sociological phenomena or a biological 
phenomena or whatever,

2178
01:53:27,711 --> 01:53:29,780
but doesn't matter.
It's still the case.

2179
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:32,510
So,
and I think that's because it's probably

2180
01:53:32,511 --> 01:53:37,490
easier for high status animals to 
produce high status offspring.

2181
01:53:37,850 --> 01:53:39,080
Obviously.
Why not?

2182
01:53:39,081 --> 01:53:41,930
They have better access to everything 
and they're more confident.

2183
01:53:41,931 --> 01:53:44,600
So stands to reason.
Okay.

2184
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:45,733
Then there's the constraints of the 
dominance hierarchy itself because it's 

2185
01:53:48,201 --> 01:53:49,034
a particular kind of structure.
It has to operate within particular 

2186
01:53:51,411 --> 01:53:53,150
kinds of principles.
Okay.

2187
01:53:53,151 --> 01:53:55,490
So we were chimps

2188
01:53:56,890 --> 01:54:00,280
and then our brains started to grow.
We discovered how to use fire,

2189
01:54:00,281 --> 01:54:04,210
we discovered how to use language,
we discovered how to imitate each other.

2190
01:54:04,660 --> 01:54:05,493
And we're really good at that.
We discovered how to specify what 

2191
01:54:08,201 --> 01:54:11,080
someone is interested in by looking at 
where their eyes were pointing.

2192
01:54:11,230 --> 01:54:13,780
And that's why we have whites around our
iris.

2193
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:15,520
It's so that I can tell where you're 
looking,

2194
01:54:15,521 --> 01:54:18,400
so I know what you're up to.
Gorillas don't have that.

2195
01:54:18,970 --> 01:54:19,803
So what that basically meant was the 
precursors to us whose eyes weren't 

2196
01:54:23,921 --> 01:54:26,470
distinguishable,
the direction of their eyes pointing,

2197
01:54:26,471 --> 01:54:28,960
they didn't make or were killed because 
no one knew what they were up to.

2198
01:54:29,380 --> 01:54:32,440
So we have all these abilities that are 
built right into our body.

2199
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:36,580
We built the hierarchies,
they come up automatically,

2200
01:54:36,610 --> 01:54:39,160
right?
They emerged from the bottom and then we

2201
01:54:39,161 --> 01:54:39,994
watched them and infer the structure and
that's where we start getting into 

2202
01:54:44,650 --> 01:54:46,720
drama.
So that's imitation,

2203
01:54:46,721 --> 01:54:47,554
but complex imitation of longterm 
narratives and then representations of 

2204
01:54:50,711 --> 01:54:52,570
the drama.
And so that would be fiction.

2205
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:56,050
And then extraction of archetipal themes
from the,

2206
01:54:56,290 --> 01:54:58,030
from the fiction or the other way 
around.

2207
01:54:58,031 --> 01:55:00,070
It might be that what we extracted out 
first,

2208
01:55:00,071 --> 01:55:02,830
where the archetypal themes makes more 
sense really.

2209
01:55:03,010 --> 01:55:05,140
And that would be the primordial 
religions.

2210
01:55:05,410 --> 01:55:07,540
What's at the top of the dominance 
hierarchy?

2211
01:55:08,050 --> 01:55:09,790
God,
What's God?

2212
01:55:09,970 --> 01:55:11,890
Well,
it's a kind of ideal.

2213
01:55:12,040 --> 01:55:14,380
It's a kind of ideal.
You might think that

2214
01:55:17,210 --> 01:55:21,170
this is an oversimplification.
It was frequently the case.

2215
01:55:21,230 --> 01:55:22,063
And I'll tell you the stories that 
archaic people like the Sumerians 

2216
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:31,070
conceptualize their leader as the 
incarnation of God on earth,

2217
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:33,710
and he would have the responsibility to 
act that way.

2218
01:55:33,711 --> 01:55:36,650
It's a very common human cognitive 
operations,

2219
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:37,700
right?
Japanese,

2220
01:55:37,701 --> 01:55:38,534
we're doing that right up to the second 
world war and they still do it to some 

2221
01:55:40,731 --> 01:55:43,740
degree.
So it's like this is natural thought.

2222
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:45,113
The leader is an Avatar of God.
What's God will leave that question 

2223
01:55:51,511 --> 01:55:55,480
aside for now.
What's a good avatar or good avatars,

2224
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:58,920
whatever has sovereignty and authority?
Well,

2225
01:55:58,940 --> 01:56:01,980
what is sovereignty and authority?
Well,

2226
01:56:01,981 --> 01:56:02,814
we're trying to figure that out.
Sovereignty and authority is whatever 

2227
01:56:04,741 --> 01:56:05,574
stabilizes the dominance hierarchy with 
multiple members across large spans of 

2228
01:56:09,091 --> 01:56:09,924
time in a way that won't be overthrown.
We don't know the answer to it because 

2229
01:56:12,961 --> 01:56:13,794
it's an ongoing investigation and a lot 
of it's worked out at the behavioral 

2230
01:56:17,401 --> 01:56:18,234
level.
But then once we started to observe it 

2231
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:22,380
and tell stories about each other and 
imitate each other,

2232
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:24,810
we could start encapsulating that in 
stories.

2233
01:56:25,530 --> 01:56:27,630
And so what time is it?

2234
01:56:29,970 --> 01:56:32,950
Three 11 okay.
I'll one more sentence.

2235
01:56:32,951 --> 01:56:34,590
So I'll give you a break then.
I'm going to tell you,

2236
01:56:34,630 --> 01:56:36,360
uh,
one of the world's great stories.

2237
01:56:36,361 --> 01:56:37,051
Okay,
so here,

2238
01:56:37,051 --> 01:56:39,390
here's the idea.
We're banging.

2239
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:43,320
So just like when I'm playing with my 
son physically,

2240
01:56:43,980 --> 01:56:45,960
we're trying to optimize the 
interaction.

2241
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:47,393
And the way we do that is by calibrating
each other's strengths and weaknesses 

2242
01:56:50,610 --> 01:56:51,443
and at each other's emotional reactions 
in a way that makes it fun and 

2243
01:56:54,751 --> 01:56:58,380
interesting and exciting and almost 
terrifying.

2244
01:56:58,590 --> 01:57:02,400
And that in a way that both players 
really want the game to continue.

2245
01:57:02,730 --> 01:57:03,870
Okay.
How do you do that?

2246
01:57:04,410 --> 01:57:06,240
Well,
you can't say,

2247
01:57:07,470 --> 01:57:08,131
you can say,
well,

2248
01:57:08,131 --> 01:57:10,860
you have to play fair.
That's a reasonable proposition.

2249
01:57:10,861 --> 01:57:12,690
You can't hurt the kid.
You know,

2250
01:57:12,691 --> 01:57:13,524
there's arbitrary things you can't do.
You can draw out some general 

2251
01:57:15,451 --> 01:57:16,284
principles,
but basically you have to figure it out 

2252
01:57:17,281 --> 01:57:18,114
on the fly.

2253
01:57:18,270 --> 01:57:20,430
Okay,
that's how we organize our hierarchies.

2254
01:57:20,431 --> 01:57:23,100
We figure it out on the fly,
but then what do we do?

2255
01:57:24,780 --> 01:57:29,100
We watch those hierarchies over 
thousands of years and communicate about

2256
01:57:29,101 --> 01:57:29,934
it.
And so we're trying to figure out what 

2257
01:57:31,231 --> 01:57:33,120
the hell is it that we're up to.
Exactly.

2258
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:36,480
And then we even take it a bit further,
which is not only what is it that we are

2259
01:57:36,481 --> 01:57:39,420
up to,
but what is it that we should be up to?

2260
01:57:39,750 --> 01:57:40,583
It's like how do you idealize the 
dominance hierarchy structure and what 

2261
01:57:42,631 --> 01:57:46,230
should be at the top?
And the proposition is something like an

2262
01:57:46,231 --> 01:57:50,220
Avatar of the highest value is the thing
that's at the top.

2263
01:57:50,790 --> 01:57:53,580
And then the next question is,
what the hell is that?

2264
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:58,860
An answer to that is we're not smart 
enough to conceptualize it property,

2265
01:57:58,861 --> 01:58:00,450
partly because it's an emergent 
property.

2266
01:58:00,451 --> 01:58:03,510
It's very complex,
biological,

2267
01:58:03,511 --> 01:58:05,520
sociological,
emergent phenomena.

2268
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:06,713
And so we're trying to close in on it 
and that's what we're doing when we're 

2269
01:58:09,031 --> 01:58:11,940
telling stories.
We're trying to close in on it.

2270
01:58:11,970 --> 01:58:12,803
What's the ideal human behavior?
So I have a friend visiting right now 

2271
01:58:17,161 --> 01:58:17,850
and he's,
uh,

2272
01:58:17,850 --> 01:58:19,830
he writes thrillers.
He's written like 20 of them.

2273
01:58:20,630 --> 01:58:23,730
And he writes comic books like Batman 
and Wolverine and so on and so forth.

2274
01:58:23,731 --> 01:58:27,690
And so he's interested in,
so the thriller genre,

2275
01:58:27,691 --> 01:58:30,630
most of what he writes about are our 
vigilante stories.

2276
01:58:30,660 --> 01:58:31,493
You know where someone is wrong,
their family is threatened in some 

2277
01:58:34,170 --> 01:58:36,540
manner.
Maybe it's outside the normal strictures

2278
01:58:36,541 --> 01:58:38,850
of the law and they're supposed to do 
something about it.

2279
01:58:39,150 --> 01:58:42,740
So I asked him what the hell he was up 
to because he's a smart guy.

2280
01:58:42,741 --> 01:58:43,151
I thought,
well,

2281
01:58:43,151 --> 01:58:44,680
why are you writing these thrillers?
Why?

2282
01:58:44,681 --> 01:58:45,514
Why is that the genre that captures your
interest very highly verbally 

2283
01:58:48,221 --> 01:58:49,150
intelligent,
this guy,

2284
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:50,680
and he's very well educated.

2285
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:51,701
I thought,
well,

2286
01:58:51,701 --> 01:58:52,720
what are you up to?
And he said,

2287
01:58:52,721 --> 01:58:54,460
well,
it seems to be something like this.

2288
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:58,210
I'm trying to figure out.
So usually in a thriller,

2289
01:58:58,330 --> 01:59:03,220
the,
the force that is attacking the castle,

2290
01:59:03,221 --> 01:59:06,490
the structure,
the family is some male gone mad.

2291
01:59:06,491 --> 01:59:08,560
So it's like,
it's like animal man,

2292
01:59:08,710 --> 01:59:11,920
you know,
some brutal psychopathic guy or a serial

2293
01:59:11,921 --> 01:59:14,530
killer or some like arch criminal or 
something like that.

2294
01:59:14,531 --> 01:59:16,540
Same thing you see in comic books.
It's like,

2295
01:59:16,541 --> 01:59:17,800
okay,
that's like,

2296
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:20,860
that's like the masculine end of the 
monster.

2297
01:59:21,340 --> 01:59:23,940
Okay.
But then the protagonist and say,

2298
01:59:23,980 --> 01:59:27,910
typical protagonist might be a man 
trying to protect his family.

2299
01:59:28,310 --> 01:59:29,143
He's like,
okay,

2300
01:59:29,830 --> 01:59:32,620
what do you do in a monster attack?
Something that you love.

2301
01:59:32,830 --> 01:59:33,663
Well,
if,

2302
01:59:33,820 --> 01:59:36,150
if you're just like made out of tissue 
paper and,

2303
01:59:36,410 --> 01:59:37,720
and gelatin,
you know,

2304
01:59:37,721 --> 01:59:38,554
you just fall over and die and then 
monster comes in and steals everything 

2305
01:59:40,991 --> 01:59:43,120
you have and kills everyone and that's 
the end of the story.

2306
01:59:43,690 --> 01:59:44,800
It's like,
okay,

2307
01:59:44,801 --> 01:59:45,634
you have to meet force with force.
Now that's a weird thing because if you 

2308
01:59:49,181 --> 01:59:50,014
go on a monster on the outside and 
you're in the inside and you're also 

2309
01:59:53,981 --> 01:59:56,020
male,
we'll save for this example.

2310
01:59:56,290 --> 02:00:00,850
If you don't allow yourself to be the 
kind of monster that the monster is,

2311
02:00:00,851 --> 02:00:05,140
he's going to win.
So then the question is how do you allow

2312
02:00:05,141 --> 02:00:05,974
yourself to be the kind of monster 
that's capable of protecting things 

2313
02:00:08,770 --> 02:00:09,603
without turning into the monster while,
so all his books are explorations of 

2314
02:00:13,121 --> 02:00:13,870
that.
It's like,

2315
02:00:13,870 --> 02:00:14,703
okay,
here's a limit situation where even the 

2316
02:00:16,301 --> 02:00:19,120
rules aren't working.
Your families on the line,

2317
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:21,790
the law can't protect you.
What do you do?

2318
02:00:22,030 --> 02:00:23,170
Well,
we don't know.

2319
02:00:23,270 --> 02:00:26,050
You've curl up and die.
Do you hide in the basement?

2320
02:00:26,051 --> 02:00:28,690
Do you make a safe room?
Do you move to another state?

2321
02:00:28,691 --> 02:00:30,310
You know,
you could just take it,

2322
02:00:30,430 --> 02:00:32,110
you fight back,
do you arm yourself?

2323
02:00:32,110 --> 02:00:34,540
Like,
who knows,

2324
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:36,280
right?
What's the right thing to do?

2325
02:00:36,970 --> 02:00:40,660
Well,
the right thing to do doesn't seem to be

2326
02:00:40,661 --> 02:00:43,810
to let that win.
Okay.

2327
02:00:43,811 --> 02:00:44,644
So he's trying to,
he's laying out various simulations of 

2328
02:00:46,931 --> 02:00:47,980
responses,
you know,

2329
02:00:48,220 --> 02:00:49,900
and he has all sorts of reasons for 
doing so.

2330
02:00:50,230 --> 02:00:53,050
So that's partly what we're doing with 
stories,

2331
02:00:53,051 --> 02:00:53,884
right?
We're not only representing what it is 

2332
02:00:55,181 --> 02:00:56,014
that we're doing and if we're not,
you'd go and watch the movie and you'd 

2333
02:00:58,271 --> 02:00:59,104
say that wasn't very realistic.
It has to be a good enough model of the 

2334
02:01:03,041 --> 02:01:05,410
world as it is so that you find it 
credible.

2335
02:01:05,740 --> 02:01:10,210
It can twist a principal or two around 
and ask you to suspend disbelief for the

2336
02:01:10,211 --> 02:01:12,130
purposes of exploration.
You know,

2337
02:01:12,131 --> 02:01:14,740
like what would it be like if you had 
ex-ray eyes?

2338
02:01:14,741 --> 02:01:15,401
You know,
it's,

2339
02:01:15,401 --> 02:01:16,234
it's sort of like a superhero thing and 
people will put up with that because 

2340
02:01:18,851 --> 02:01:22,570
it's an exploratory,
it's an exploratory process.

2341
02:01:22,600 --> 02:01:23,433
You know,
you can't just break a bunch of rules 

2342
02:01:24,791 --> 02:01:25,560
arbitrarily.
There'll,

2343
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:27,220
because people get bored of the story,
right?

2344
02:01:27,221 --> 02:01:29,110
It's,
it's not a realistic simulation.

2345
02:01:29,770 --> 02:01:32,470
You're playing out simulations in a 
moral landscape.

2346
02:01:33,310 --> 02:01:34,143
So,
and I would say the simulations that 

2347
02:01:37,751 --> 02:01:40,680
have worked best,
our architect,

2348
02:01:42,110 --> 02:01:45,440
so there's deep themes that are kind of,
they're,

2349
02:01:45,441 --> 02:01:46,274
they're,
they're,

2350
02:01:46,340 --> 02:01:49,010
they're like templates and there's 
somewhat vague,

2351
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:52,070
the details have to be filled in,
in your own life.

2352
02:01:52,610 --> 02:01:53,443
But there are broad narrative themes 
that are the fundamental framework 

2353
02:01:58,640 --> 02:02:03,500
within which the specific moral 
hierarchy that you need has to be built.

2354
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:05,900
That's the proposition.
Okay,

2355
02:02:05,901 --> 02:02:10,250
so now what we're going to do is we're 
going to look at those narratives.

2356
02:02:10,820 --> 02:02:13,190
And so what we're trying to do,
two things,

2357
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:19,000
we're trying to figure out what's the 
proper way to conceptualize the world if

2358
02:02:20,721 --> 02:02:23,300
your problem is that you have to act and
live it.

2359
02:02:23,870 --> 02:02:24,703
Question Number One,
question number two is if you're in the 

2360
02:02:28,971 --> 02:02:31,010
world and you have it conceptualized 
properly,

2361
02:02:32,150 --> 02:02:34,520
how should you act?
All right?

2362
02:02:34,550 --> 02:02:37,820
And so that's what these stories are 
trying to solve now,

2363
02:02:39,170 --> 02:02:40,003
are they correct?
It's like they're low resolution 

2364
02:02:45,181 --> 02:02:48,660
photographs.
That's what they are.

2365
02:02:49,620 --> 02:02:50,453
Or they're low resolution movies and 
people have been working on them for a 

2366
02:02:53,581 --> 02:02:55,770
long time now.
There's a twist here,

2367
02:02:55,771 --> 02:02:57,570
which I think is a very cool twist.

2368
02:03:01,770 --> 02:03:02,603
The twist is what is it that's necessary
in a story for you to find the story 

2369
02:03:07,231 --> 02:03:08,970
compelling,
right,

2370
02:03:08,971 --> 02:03:12,160
because that's an interesting thing.
It's like obviously you go to a movie,

2371
02:03:12,161 --> 02:03:12,721
you say,
man,

2372
02:03:12,721 --> 02:03:15,210
I love that are you go there and you 
think that stunk.

2373
02:03:15,211 --> 02:03:17,250
You know,
I never inflict that on anyone.

2374
02:03:17,251 --> 02:03:18,180
It's like,
well,

2375
02:03:18,181 --> 02:03:20,850
they're both stories.
They're both expensive.

2376
02:03:20,851 --> 02:03:22,980
They're borth,
well produced and sophisticated.

2377
02:03:23,340 --> 02:03:27,180
One grabs your interest.
You can't get away from it and the other

2378
02:03:27,181 --> 02:03:29,400
doesn't.
It's like why?

2379
02:03:30,420 --> 02:03:31,253
What is it about some kinds of stories 
that grab you and won't let you go and 

2380
02:03:35,221 --> 02:03:37,080
now there's the don't.
Well,

2381
02:03:37,260 --> 02:03:40,020
that's a complicated thing,
but one of the things I'm going to pause

2382
02:03:40,021 --> 02:03:40,854
it is that not only are there,
not only does the dominance hierarchy 

2383
02:03:45,870 --> 02:03:49,920
have a structure that replicates itself 
roughly across time,

2384
02:03:51,450 --> 02:03:52,283
but you're adapted to that structure.
And part of that Ab deputation is that 

2385
02:03:57,030 --> 02:04:01,770
when you're presented with patterns of 
behavior that are general,

2386
02:04:02,490 --> 02:04:03,323
but that also partake of the quality of 
being useful within dominance 

2387
02:04:07,141 --> 02:04:08,490
hierarchies.
You're a chat,

2388
02:04:08,520 --> 02:04:12,450
you're attracted to them.
It's just like when you're a little kid,

2389
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:13,170
look,
think of,

2390
02:04:13,170 --> 02:04:14,760
there must be people you admire,
right?

2391
02:04:14,761 --> 02:04:16,650
Think of someone you admire.
Okay.

2392
02:04:16,651 --> 02:04:18,000
Why?
Why do you admire them?

2393
02:04:19,450 --> 02:04:22,440
So give me an answer.
Like if you pick someone you admire,

2394
02:04:22,470 --> 02:04:24,210
why do you admire them?
Just pick someone.

2395
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:27,840
Anybody got an answer to that?
Okay,

2396
02:04:29,870 --> 02:04:34,870
thank are respectful.
Paved the way for some potential.

2397
02:04:35,830 --> 02:04:36,520
Okay.
Okay.

2398
02:04:36,520 --> 02:04:38,580
Okay,
so that seems to be about right Tay.

2399
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:39,473
There's something about that.
But it's interesting because often the 

2400
02:04:42,421 --> 02:04:46,440
admiration will emerge in the absence of
articulated reasons for it.

2401
02:04:46,740 --> 02:04:47,573
You know,
it's more or less something that hits 

2402
02:04:48,271 --> 02:04:51,090
you rather than,
and maybe you post-hoc think,

2403
02:04:51,091 --> 02:04:53,550
well this is why,
but it hits you.

2404
02:04:53,970 --> 02:04:56,160
Now there's some being some experiments 
down,

2405
02:04:56,161 --> 02:04:56,994
I think with vervet monkeys.
So you take vervet monkeys in a 

2406
02:05:01,471 --> 02:05:02,304
hierarchy and you take photos of the low
ranking individuals and you take photos 

2407
02:05:05,011 --> 02:05:07,680
of the high ranking individuals and then
you show the vervet monkeys,

2408
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:10,320
the low ranking individuals,
the high ranking individuals,

2409
02:05:10,590 --> 02:05:13,530
the verbage will look longer at the high
ranking individuals.

2410
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:17,490
So you might say,
here's a hypothesis for you.

2411
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:19,913
If you see someone manifest elements of 
the rough pattern that across dominance 

2412
02:05:24,991 --> 02:05:29,040
hierarchies enables people to succeed,
you'll be attracted to that,

2413
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:31,710
right?
And that person,

2414
02:05:31,711 --> 02:05:32,544
by focusing on that person,
you can flesh out the archetype in some 

2415
02:05:36,151 --> 02:05:37,140
sense.
You know,

2416
02:05:37,141 --> 02:05:40,440
because the one a student asked me once,
they said,

2417
02:05:40,441 --> 02:05:42,720
look,
if archetypal stories are real,

2418
02:05:42,721 --> 02:05:43,554
why can't we just tell the architectural
story over and over the same story I 

2419
02:05:47,281 --> 02:05:48,870
called Jesus.
That's really the question.

2420
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:49,790
It's like,
hmm,

2421
02:05:50,220 --> 02:05:51,053
why would that be?
And I would say like in primordial 

2422
02:05:52,981 --> 02:05:54,600
cultures,
that does really happen.

2423
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:57,090
It is repetition of the architectural 
story.

2424
02:05:57,270 --> 02:05:59,100
But in a sophisticated culture like 
ours,

2425
02:05:59,101 --> 02:06:02,820
there's like 100,000
fiction works.

2426
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:04,200
Why?
Well,

2427
02:06:04,201 --> 02:06:05,034
I think part of it is is that the 
archetype in some sense is the template 

2428
02:06:10,741 --> 02:06:11,574
for good person,
but it doesn't fill in the details 

2429
02:06:13,831 --> 02:06:16,740
underneath that are relevant for this 
place and this time.

2430
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:20,250
And so the fiction,
if it's a good work of fiction,

2431
02:06:20,490 --> 02:06:21,323
the archetype shines through it.
But it shines through in a way that you 

2432
02:06:24,121 --> 02:06:24,954
can extract out information that 
actually works here and now in this 

2433
02:06:27,661 --> 02:06:29,700
situation.
So you need,

2434
02:06:29,850 --> 02:06:31,890
you need both the archetypal 
representation,

2435
02:06:31,891 --> 02:06:32,724
which is how to be a good person.
And then you need information about the 

2436
02:06:35,611 --> 02:06:39,180
particulars of how to be a good person 
so that you can actually do that.

2437
02:06:39,181 --> 02:06:40,014
And I think that what happens when you 
find someone you admire is they embody 

2438
02:06:42,991 --> 02:06:46,110
the archetype,
but they've fleshed out the skills.

2439
02:06:46,210 --> 02:06:49,440
And so if you watch them and copy them 
and apprentice yourself to them,

2440
02:06:49,650 --> 02:06:51,990
then you can pull that in.
And it's a great,

2441
02:06:52,310 --> 02:06:53,143
magnificent way of developing because it
means that you can benefit from their 

2442
02:06:56,161 --> 02:06:56,994
experience without having to go through 
the same laborious process hopefully of 

2443
02:07:01,891 --> 02:07:04,860
acquiring that wisdom.
That's why you go to university,

2444
02:07:05,130 --> 02:07:07,800
right.
And principle cause it's easier to go to

2445
02:07:07,801 --> 02:07:08,634
university and learn the information 
that it is to go out there and bang 

2446
02:07:11,611 --> 02:07:15,120
yourself out against the world and learn
all these things the hard way,

2447
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:17,190
which you don't have time for.
Yes.

2448
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:30,800
Or don't want.
Yeah.

2449
02:07:30,801 --> 02:07:31,634
Because a good counter example is also 
sometimes a counter example is even 

2450
02:07:34,281 --> 02:07:35,114
better because,
and this is another way to think about 

2451
02:07:37,151 --> 02:07:39,190
morality.
I just wrote a chapter,

2452
02:07:39,310 --> 02:07:41,710
I'm writing a book.
I wrote a chapter called cal the truth,

2453
02:07:42,370 --> 02:07:43,420
and then I thought,
Ooh,

2454
02:07:43,690 --> 02:07:47,860
that might not be the right title.
Because then you run into Pontius pilots

2455
02:07:47,861 --> 02:07:48,694
problem,
right?

2456
02:07:49,270 --> 02:07:51,580
What is truth?
Well,

2457
02:07:52,030 --> 02:07:53,050
good question.
It's like,

2458
02:07:53,051 --> 02:07:54,340
do I know the truth?
It's like,

2459
02:07:54,550 --> 02:07:57,610
no.
Plus it's dynamic moves around,

2460
02:07:57,611 --> 02:07:58,444
you know,
so maybe the re the property is don't 

2461
02:08:01,451 --> 02:08:03,370
lie,
that's different.

2462
02:08:03,910 --> 02:08:04,661
And you might say,
well,

2463
02:08:04,661 --> 02:08:06,760
how do I know the difference between 
truth and falsehood?

2464
02:08:06,790 --> 02:08:07,541
You might say that.
I say,

2465
02:08:07,541 --> 02:08:10,360
well,
most of the time you don't ignore that.

2466
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:13,750
Sometimes you do.
So when you do,

2467
02:08:13,751 --> 02:08:15,070
no,
don't do it.

2468
02:08:15,370 --> 02:08:16,203
So are you.
That doesn't mean that you know the 

2469
02:08:17,171 --> 02:08:18,004
truth,
but it does mean that you've identified 

2470
02:08:19,331 --> 02:08:20,164
a useful false hood.
And that's a good thing because partly 

2471
02:08:22,901 --> 02:08:26,770
what you need to know to go forward is 
what not to do and also what to do.

2472
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:27,633
But often what not to do.
It's like the Old Testament 10 

2473
02:08:30,071 --> 02:08:31,270
Commandments.
It's like,

2474
02:08:31,271 --> 02:08:32,980
here's some rough things you shouldn't 
do.

2475
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:34,960
Well,
why?

2476
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:36,250
Well,
we've kind of,

2477
02:08:36,940 --> 02:08:39,580
you know,
ground ground our way through that.

2478
02:08:39,730 --> 02:08:42,340
Or they absolutes.
No,

2479
02:08:42,341 --> 02:08:43,960
they're like,
they're like a pattern.

2480
02:08:44,110 --> 02:08:46,120
It's a pattern.
You can vary it,

2481
02:08:46,150 --> 02:08:47,570
but,
but you,

2482
02:08:47,660 --> 02:08:49,780
you mess with it at your peril.
That's the,

2483
02:08:49,810 --> 02:08:52,210
that's the hypothesis.
So,

2484
02:08:56,570 --> 02:09:00,080
okay,
let's take 10 minutes and then I'll tell

2485
02:09:00,081 --> 02:09:03,440
you the Mesopotamian creation myth,
which is lovely story.
