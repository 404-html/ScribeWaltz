1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,660
Hi Guys.
So,

2
00:00:06,661 --> 00:00:07,494
um,
we're going to talk about the brain 

3
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:10,644
today.
Last lecture I talked to you a little 

4
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:20,400
bit about construct validation and what 
it means to measure something.

5
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:24,510
And so we're gonna take a bit of a 
detour.

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,970
So I told you about measurement problems
last time.

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,420
If you do your measurement properly in 
psychometrics,

8
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,283
if you're studying personality,
if you're studying individual 

9
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:39,624
differences,
there are roughly six things that you 

10
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:45,780
can discover and they can be broken up 
in different ways.

11
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,270
That's the big five model,
extroversion and neuroticism,

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,850
agreeableness,
conscientiousness,

13
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:56,460
openness,
and they can be subdivided as you should

14
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:57,740
know,
because it principal,

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,583
you've read the paper,
the sub divided them into 10 half turns 

16
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:02,244
out to be quite useful.
But for now we'll just presume that 

17
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:05,604
there are five.
And then the other factor of human 

18
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:13,830
function that's pretty easy to derive 
and measure his Iq.

19
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,693
Now,
Iq likely nests under openness because 

20
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:21,390
openness looks like it's something 
roughly like intellect,

21
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:23,250
which has interest in ideas,
but it,

22
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,084
that's probably an ability with ideas.
But that's probably measured better by 

23
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:28,284
an Iq test.
So if I ask you how smart you are and 

24
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:30,954
you say you're pretty smart,
that would give you a relatively high 

25
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:36,240
score on the intellect scale.
But if I tested your Iq,

26
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:38,550
I will get a better measure than not.
So in some sense,

27
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:43,380
Iq nests inside the big five model,
but you can think about it as a separate

28
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:45,270
thing and I think it's reasonable to do 
that.

29
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,104
So you know,
it depends on what you're up to 

30
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,023
fundamentally.
Now when the big five was first 

31
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:55,170
invented,
invented or discovered,

32
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:59,460
depending on how you look at it,
as I mentioned briefly as well,

33
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:00,294
it was brute force statistics basically.
So the idea behind the big five is that 

34
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,190
the,
uh,

35
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,023
it's called the lexical hypothesis and 
Alexa Co hypothesis is that because 

36
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,210
human traits are so important to us 
because we want to understand ourselves,

37
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:18,690
and perhaps even more importantly,
we want to understand other people.

38
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,763
And because we have language,
there's a reasonable probability that 

39
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:27,480
we've encapsulated the structure of 
human personality within our language.

40
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,500
And so if you analyze the language 
linguistic representations properly,

41
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:37,590
then perhaps you can extract out the 
central personality features.

42
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,420
And that's basically what the lexical 
hypothesis is and it,

43
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,263
it's important to know the lexical 
hypothesis and it's a bit more 

44
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,383
sophisticated than that because it 
basically presumes that you can extract 

45
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:53,790
out route valid information about 
personality from adjectives,

46
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,780
descriptive adjectives from phrases and 
from questions,

47
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,883
and you'll get the same basic 
dimensional structure regardless of 

48
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:03,424
which of those techniques you use.
And that turns out to be true for all 

49
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,820
intents and purposes.
Now,

50
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,980
the lexical hypothesis depends on its 
validity,

51
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,280
depends for its validity on the initial 
claim.

52
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,323
That personality is accurately 
represented within the structure of 

53
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:22,414
language.
And so one of the things I would say is 

54
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:29,050
that there's a week big five hypothesis 
and a strong,

55
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:30,310
big five hypothesis.

56
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,173
Okay.
The week big five hypothesis is that in 

57
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:37,900
so far as you use language to describe 
personality,

58
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:41,950
personality has a five factor structure 
that's reliably extractable.

59
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,111
Now,
the strong,

60
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:44,944
Big Five theory is that no,
no personality has a fight factor 

61
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,500
structure and it's accurately 
represented in language.

62
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:52,810
But when you pull out the structure from
language,

63
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:57,610
what you're pulling out is actually 
representative of genuine personality.

64
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,583
Now,
the week hypothesis is I would say it's 

65
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:06,520
established and it's worth knowing 
because what it,

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,833
what it means is that if you invent a 
questionnaire that has anything to do 

67
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:14,140
with self description,
it might be self description at multiple

68
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:16,480
different levels of analysis,
um,

69
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,493
like values for example.
And instead of just adjectives or 

70
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,023
attitudes instead of just adjectives.
I mean these categories are sort of of 

71
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,640
uh,
unclear.

72
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,270
What's the difference between your 
attitude and your temperament?

73
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,113
Well,
you know,

74
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,750
it's usually defined by the sentence 
that you use the words in,

75
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:36,280
right?
You extract out the words,

76
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,230
they sort of stand there alone.
They don't,

77
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,270
it's very difficult to clarify their 
meaning.

78
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,360
Anyways,
the lexical hypothesis I think is one of

79
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:47,194
the most well established.
It's one of the most well validated 

80
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:52,594
claims in psychology.
I think it might be the most validated 

81
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:56,374
claim apart from maybe the work that is 
extracted Iq out from cognitive 

82
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,830
questions.
And uh,

83
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,360
basically it was brute force statistics.
You know,

84
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:08,194
people develop different lists of 
adjectives and you can complain in some 

85
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,110
ways about how they did it and we'll 
talk about that later.

86
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,530
But because they tried to throw out the 
evaluative words,

87
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:19,180
like good and evil,
for example,

88
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:21,530
those aren't in the big five.
Um,

89
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,653
so they tried to only use adjectives 
that didn't necessarily seem to be like 

90
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:31,300
highly or like valued or devalued.
So introvert and extrovert,

91
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,790
while they're opposites,
but you know,

92
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,360
is it better to be an introvert?
It's better to be the extroverts like,

93
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,650
well,
it's not obvious.

94
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,483
So those were all the words that cover 
that dimension can be kept in because 

95
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,410
there's no value judgements associated 
with it.

96
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,244
And the originators of the big five 
theory wanted to keep it as free of 

97
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:53,050
values as possible.
Now that's already a hypothesis,

98
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:53,884
right?
It's a hypothesis that you can come up 

99
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:57,340
with an accurate description of human 
personality,

100
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,503
even if you eliminate all the words that
have to do that are clearly valence 

101
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:03,110
east.
And,

102
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:03,944
uh,
we did an experiment here a while back 

103
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:07,990
that was pretty interesting.
Um,

104
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,193
we got hold of our data set of 
descriptive adjectives and we put all 

105
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:14,090
the evaluative words back in,
so,

106
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,193
you know,
like nasty and horrible and awkward and 

107
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,920
uh,
cruel.

108
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,220
And,
um,

109
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,490
and then the good words as well,
you know,

110
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,780
moral,
pleasant,

111
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,370
uplifting,
all of those things.

112
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:28,280
And,
and we had people rate people they liked

113
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:31,310
and people they didn't like using that 
expanded list.

114
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,540
And we got a real archetype in some 
sense of the hateable person.

115
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:36,374
And a tremendous number of the words 
that were used came from the evaluative 

116
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,303
dimension.
So I think that when you throw out the 

117
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:42,794
evaluative words,
you actually throw out a lot of what 

118
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:48,170
people actually use.
Descriptive words to describe.

119
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,033
Because you know,
when you like someone or don't like 

120
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:53,000
someone if someone's likable or 
unlikable,

121
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:56,520
that's pretty important phenomena.
You know what I mean?

122
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,093
You hang around the people you like 
generally speaking and you don't 

123
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:01,460
associate with the people you don't 
like.

124
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:06,140
So it's a fundamental choice.
But we all talk about that later because

125
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,153
there's reasons that happened and the 
reasons were valid and it's not that 

126
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:13,220
easy to fix it.
And besides that,

127
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:15,890
the standard five factor model has all 
sorts of utility.

128
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,263
So,
but you need to know what its strengths 

129
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:19,370
are and its limitations are.

130
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,043
Now hypothetically,
what you knew to draw out the five 

131
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,374
factor model is you take,
imagine the sec of all descriptive 

132
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:27,890
adjectives.
Okay.

133
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:28,724
And then you take a random sample of 
those descriptive adjectives so that 

134
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:34,004
it's not biased.
You don't have to use all of them 

135
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:36,854
because you know,
if you ask someone to describe 

136
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:39,014
themselves on a questionnaire using all 
the adjectives we have that describe 

137
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:44,480
personality,
they'd be there for like a day.

138
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:47,570
And so that's not very efficient.
And so you want to take a random sample,

139
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,620
maybe you only sample the words that 
people are most likely to use.

140
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,510
So for example,
if you go online,

141
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:55,880
you'll find that there are word 
frequency tables,

142
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,670
you know,
and most of your language,

143
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:03,080
most of the about 500 words covers about
80% of what you say.

144
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,400
So you know,
and I don't remember what the lexicon of

145
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:08,750
the typical person is,
I,

146
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,830
I think it's in the neighborhood of 
3,500 words,

147
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:13,664
but that might be wrong,
but there's like 750,000 words in the 

148
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:17,760
English language know.

149
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,050
It's an omnivorous language.
It just pulled words in from all over.

150
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:23,720
And so you hardly use any of those 
words,

151
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,583
you know,
and there's ones that are used 

152
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:27,164
extraordinarily in frequently.
So what you could do is you could look 

153
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:33,320
at the total set of adjectives and then 
you could pull out,

154
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,510
you know,
identify the ones,

155
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,830
the ones that are used,
you know,

156
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:37,664
the thousand most frequently used words 
and that probably cover 95% of the 

157
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:41,804
territory.
And then you could pick out random set 

158
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:47,120
of a hundred and you could administer it
to people and then you can factor it,

159
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:49,700
analyze it,
you administered it to lots of people,

160
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,623
then you factor analyze it and you get 
five relatively clear and stable 

161
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:55,500
factors.
And the most,

162
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,620
the one that comes out first,
so it's,

163
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,454
it's the dominant factor in some sense 
or the easiest to measure are maybe the 

164
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:04,860
best representative language or 
something like that.

165
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,693
It's extroversion versus introversion.
And extroversion is a positive emotion 

166
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:12,204
dimension and it's associated with 
enthusiasm and assertiveness and 

167
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:21,054
assertive people will say they'll 
dominate the conversation with language 

168
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,260
or they'll while back basically that's 
about the right way to think about it.

169
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,320
I'm enthusiastic people,
they're up for anything.

170
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,970
You know,
they're the ones that are always smiling

171
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:35,100
and telling jokes and having parties and
that sort of thing.

172
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:37,800
And generally extroverts really liked to
be around people,

173
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,230
so they're happy.
They're gregarious,

174
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,540
they're assertive,
they're enthusiastic,

175
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,630
they're noisy,
they blink bore than introverts.

176
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,160
Now why that is,
I have no idea.

177
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,023
But apparently they do.
So if you notice something blinking a 

178
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:52,470
lot,
you can assume that they're extroverts.

179
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,760
Um,
if they're not conscientious,

180
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,863
like you know,
there's this idea of people being 

181
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:01,260
impulsive.
It's very badly defined terms.

182
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:03,630
So when you hear a psychologist talking 
about impulsivity,

183
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,150
the first thing you could realize is 
they don't know.

184
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,403
You don't know what the hell they're 
talking about because probably there's 

185
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:09,894
no such thing as impulsivity.
But extroverted people who are not very 

186
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:15,444
conscientious tend to,
that's one of the things that you might 

187
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:21,660
think about as associated with 
impulsivity.

188
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:23,220
There's all sorts of other things though
too.

189
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,540
So,
um,

190
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,913
okay,
so there's a positive emotion dimension 

191
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:29,160
and that's extroversion.
And there's negative emotion,

192
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,121
emotion,
dimension,

193
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:30,954
and that's neuroticism and neurotic.
Neuroticism seems to break down into 

194
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:38,310
something like withdrawal and volatility
and volatile people are touching.

195
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,713
So you know they'll,
they'll react quite a lot if something 

196
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:42,954
negative happens.
So if you've teased it and they might 

197
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:44,784
get upset or if you start fighting with 
them and that sort of provocative way 

198
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,860
instead of sort of calming everything 
down,

199
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:50,694
they will just ramp it up.
And if there's two of you that are 

200
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:56,070
volatile and you're having a 
conversation and the conversation goes a

201
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:56,940
little bit,
you know,

202
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,090
into unpleasant territory,
you can really get each other going.

203
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,553
So yes,
like in term of south beach and I can 

204
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:06,740
turn those days both.
Oh,

205
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:07,763
both.
Yeah.

206
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:12,120
I mean that's part of the problem with 
using the word emotion because you know,

207
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:14,580
is an emotion and internal state or a 
set of behaviors.

208
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:16,470
And the answer to that is as far as we 
can tell,

209
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:19,380
it's both.
So now

210
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,420
I'm going to start talking about 
extroversion and neuroticism.

211
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,583
And part of the reason for that is 
because I think the evidence for the 

212
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:33,030
relationship between those traits and 
the way the brain functions functions is

213
00:11:33,031 --> 00:11:33,864
in some sense the clearest.
Now you remember the baby five were 

214
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:39,630
extracted out using statistical 
procedures,

215
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:40,464
right?
So there's no reason to assume 

216
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,534
necessarily that the traits would bear 
any straight forward relationship to 

217
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:47,154
brain function because they didn't,
they weren't derived from analysis of 

218
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,140
brain function,
at least not directly they were at,

219
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,353
they were extracted from analysis of 
linguistic representations of other 

220
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:00,340
peoples and your own behavior.

221
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,623
But it turns out that there's quite a 
concordance between certain elements of 

222
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:10,621
neuropsychological theory and deposit of
Edom and negative emotional traits,

223
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,040
extroversion and neuroticism.
And so what I'm going to do today is I'm

224
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,510
gonna,
I'm gonna,

225
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,110
I'm going to talk to you about how 
positive and negative emotion are,

226
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,700
are,
um,

227
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,360
instantiated in some sense 
neurologically.

228
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,123
But I'm going to put that in a,
in a broader picture of brain function 

229
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:32,220
because,
well,

230
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,850
because first of all,
why not?

231
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:35,830
And second,
because a lot of the things I'm going to

232
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:36,664
tell you about the brain today,
we'll sort of retroactively shed light 

233
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:42,400
on some of the clinical theories that 
we've already talked about.

234
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,920
So,
so which is nice,

235
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:45,920
you know,
because when it,

236
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,490
one of the ways that you find out if 
something is true,

237
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:51,100
and this is something we also talked 
about during the last lecture,

238
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:51,934
is that it manifests itself even when 
you use different measurement 

239
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:57,160
techniques.

240
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,650
And so he had this statistical 
derivation,

241
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,810
you know,
which basically took place.

242
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,703
It really started to accelerate,
I would say first in the 1960s and then 

243
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:06,844
in the 1980s it made a big comeback in 
the 1980s but paralleling not were 

244
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:10,954
theories of brain development and they 
weren't really that the scientists that 

245
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:15,214
were doing the one sort of research 
really work communicating with the 

246
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:18,970
scientists that were doing the other 
kind of research.

247
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,600
So they were methodologically separate.
They use different techniques as well,

248
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,583
but they weren't talking back and forth 
much and they were using different 

249
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:27,394
measurement techniques.
So if they both come up with the same 

250
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,710
thing,
then you think,

251
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,560
oh well there's probably something to 
that because you know the sighted people

252
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,110
discovered that down there.
People who could hear discovered it.

253
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:39,640
It's,
it's the same kind of idea.

254
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,430
So,
and you know,

255
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:46,480
this has been worked out in a fair bit 
of detail over the last

256
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,480
30 years really.

257
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,890
And so,
um,

258
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,243
the,
the papers that you're supposed to read 

259
00:13:54,971 --> 00:13:56,410
with this,
they're difficult papers.

260
00:13:56,411 --> 00:13:58,090
Uh,
I believe you're reading gray,

261
00:13:58,091 --> 00:13:58,924
which is a model of the limbic system 
and Basal Ganglia applications to 

262
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:04,630
anxiety and schizophrenia.
Um,

263
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,940
um,
I think you have goals and behavior.

264
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:11,860
That's the Carbon Shire paper.
I put the Swanson paper in as optional.

265
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:14,470
That's cerebral hemisphere regulation of
motivated behavior.

266
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,483
That is a tough paper and so is the gray
paper and it's part of it because of 

267
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:19,974
these guys,
both of them graze paper is that is a 

268
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,340
distillation of a very,
very thick book that's very,

269
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:29,320
very difficult.
And that's been written twice.

270
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:32,290
It was published first in 1982 and then 
again in 1999.

271
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,423
It's a brilliant book.
It's had a tremendous impact on 

272
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:36,694
psychology.
Gray was one of those people who he was 

273
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:40,750
so damn smart.
It's just painful.

274
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,613
You know what I mean?

275
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,453
His reference list,
I don't know how many papers are in his 

276
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,124
reference lists,
like 2001 of the really weird things 

277
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:48,274
about gray that makes him stand out 
among scientist is he actually read all 

278
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:54,200
those papers and more than that he 
understood them.

279
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,370
And so that's really something.
And so gray's book on anxiety,

280
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,040
um,
he,

281
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:00,903
he,
he did a lot of work with animal 

282
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:03,194
behavior.
I'll tell you if you want like solid 

283
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,200
psychological information about how the 
brain works,

284
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,690
the people you pay attention to are the 
animal,

285
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,263
the,
the people who are studying animal 

286
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:17,840
behavior and animal grades,
they know what they're doing there.

287
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:19,970
So methodologically careful,
they're very,

288
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:20,804
very reliable and the human 
neuropsychologists and the people who 

289
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:25,490
use pet scanners and Mris and all that 
thing,

290
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,810
there are way,
way,

291
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:27,644
way behind the animal researchers 
because the animal researchers can just 

292
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:31,244
get in there at a lot higher resolution 
and they can do much more stringent 

293
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:37,350
experiments and they tend to be more 
methodological,

294
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,440
careful and more scientifically minded.

295
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,350
So anyways,
the grade book is a brilliant book.

296
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:44,750
It's very,
it took me like four months to read that

297
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:49,460
damn book and I mean I was,
I really had to take it apart because he

298
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,800
probably poured 30 years of work into 
it,

299
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:56,150
something like that.
And like he worked a lot in 30 years.

300
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,073
You know,
he did a lot of experimentation and he 

301
00:15:57,981 --> 00:15:59,870
read a lot.
And so he built a bottle of the,

302
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,510
of the brain's function that was based 
on,

303
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:06,260
partly on Russian neuropsychology,
partly on cybernetic theory,

304
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:11,090
hardly on animal behavior,
partly on neuropsychopharmacology.

305
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:11,924
And so that's the study of how drugs 
affect behavior and cognition and then 

306
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:19,790
partly partly from a higher order 
conceptual perspective.

307
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:20,624
And then he stacked all those things up,
one on top of the other to make sure 

308
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:26,540
that the picture was the same at every 
single level of analysis.

309
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,373
It's absolutely brilliant.
Where can it took the social 

310
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:32,210
psychologists?
Like they already started thinking about

311
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:33,044
gray,
although he published his book in 1982 

312
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,530
they probably started thinking about 
great,

313
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,453
seriously in about 2005 so it took 23 
years for his book to start to make its 

314
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,120
widescale entrance into the more general
psychological community.

315
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:51,110
And anyways,
and so you're going to read this paper,

316
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,020
which is a model of the limbic system 
and Basal Ganglia.

317
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,213
And it's a distillate,
it's 30 years were distilled into the 

318
00:16:57,171 --> 00:16:59,120
book and then that was distilled into 
this paper.

319
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:01,520
So you know,
it's rough going.

320
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,700
And then the Swanson paper,
he's another guy,

321
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:07,370
same kind of guy.
He's a developmental neuro anatomist.

322
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,910
And if you're really interested in 
psychology,

323
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:14,990
I would really recommend reading those 
papers because like they're hard going.

324
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:16,710
But if you get it,
you,

325
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,960
you have this substrata of knowledge 
underneath you that's really from,

326
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:24,090
and I rated like Swanson's paper,
the guy's a genius.

327
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:24,923
And what's so cool about Swanson's paper
is that if you talk to human 

328
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:29,174
neuropsychologists,
you'll find that their bias towards the 

329
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:33,860
cerebral cortex,
and there's sort of,

330
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,753
I think there's sort of an 
anthropomorphic pride that goes along 

331
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:37,671
with that.
It's like,

332
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:39,350
well,
how are we different from animals?

333
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:39,771
Well,
you know,

334
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:41,570
we've got thumbs and nuts,
great,

335
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,760
hooray for the thumbs and we stand up,
right?

336
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,953
But if you look at us neurologically,
the big differences that we have this 

337
00:17:47,121 --> 00:17:51,180
tremendously expanded cerebral cortex,
especially the prefrontal cortex.

338
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:53,100
And so then people think,
well,

339
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:53,934
because you know,
that's one of the things that 

340
00:17:55,201 --> 00:18:00,201
differentiates from animals and it's 
relatively evolutionarily modern because

341
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:04,170
the human brain really,
really developed rapidly over the last 2

342
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:08,250
million years that it's like king of the
brain in some sense.

343
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,950
And uh,
it's the place where all the complicated

344
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:13,620
things happen.
And that's just not right.

345
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,500
Because like breathing,
that's complicated.

346
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,663
That's why you don't get to control it 
voluntarily and keeping your heart 

347
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:22,590
going.
That's complicated too.

348
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,720
And so you don't get to have a decision 
about that.

349
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:25,554
Your brain has made that automatic like 
millions of years ago because there's 

350
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:30,774
just no way you're going to get 
voluntary control over something that's 

351
00:18:32,851 --> 00:18:34,630
that vital,
you know?

352
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,473
So assuming that newer brain areas do 
more complex things is in some ways I 

353
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,750
think that's actually precisely 
backwards.

354
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:45,390
It's the old brain areas that have been 
around for,

355
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,940
you know,
a hundred a hundred million years.

356
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:52,710
Those damn things are smart and that's 
why they've survived for so long and why

357
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:55,170
they're distributed and into so many 
different species.

358
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:56,490
You know,
like you,

359
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,490
your brain is somewhat like a lobster's 
brain.

360
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,473
It's a lot like a mouse brain and it's a
lot like a rat brain and you might 

361
00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:04,321
think,
well,

362
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:07,680
the rapper and isn't a very good model 
of a human brain because after all their

363
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:08,514
rats,
but one thing I can tell you is that a 

364
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,080
rat brain is a way better model of a 
human brain.

365
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,830
Then your model of a human brain is a 
model of the human brain.

366
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,993
You know what I mean?
It's like people think of the brain 

367
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,910
while they have a don't be modeled.
Use a rack as an example.

368
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:24,744
Of course it's,
it's often some ways cause rats can't 

369
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:30,540
talk for example,
but there are so many levels of analysis

370
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,240
where you,
you might as well be Iraq,

371
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,310
you know,
technically speaking,

372
00:19:35,311 --> 00:19:37,470
the neuro pharmacology for example,
is very,

373
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:40,320
very similar.
The function of the neurotransmitters,

374
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,303
the basic anatomy of the structures,
like there's a tremendous amount of of 

375
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:46,494
overlap.
And so you might as well go for the 

376
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:49,854
commonalities among brains before you 
focusing on the differences because in 

377
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:56,400
some sense that way you get the basic 
architecture right now.

378
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,130
Now one of the things that's really 
interesting about Swanson,

379
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,293
and this makes it,
and he's not a neuropsychologist and 

380
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:04,620
he's not really even a psychologist.

381
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,203
He's a developmental neuro anatomist.
And so there's lots of ways of piecing 

382
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,930
of chopping up the brain,
you know,

383
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,310
to look at it because it's a really 
complicated thing.

384
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,263
It's like saying,
well how many ways can you divide up a 

385
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:18,810
city to analyze it?
Well,

386
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,920
there's,
there's endless numbers of ways that you

387
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,200
can divide up a city to look at it.
And there's,

388
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:26,760
it's the same with the brain,
you know,

389
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:27,594
because it's,
it's infinitely sub dividable in some 

390
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:31,284
sense,
certainly all the way down to the 

391
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:35,490
molecular structures.
And then even at higher order levels,

392
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,593
you know,
because it's so complex and it's 

393
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,694
hierarchically structured,
you can just divide it up in all sorts 

394
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:44,880
of different ways.
And so at higher levels of resolution,

395
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:47,160
there isn't even that much agreement on 
how the name,

396
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,003
the parts.
Now what the developmental neuro 

397
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:54,580
anatomist do is that they look at how 
the brain develops in utero over time.

398
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,413
So he,
cause it's a developing thing that sort 

399
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:59,130
of unfolds like a flower unfolds,
you know,

400
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,430
and you can track how the,
you know,

401
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,020
which part of the early brain turns into
the later brain.

402
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:08,500
And so you can get some sense of the 
like,

403
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,690
it's like an evolutionary tree.
You know,

404
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,330
if these three parts grew out of this 
part,

405
00:21:13,331 --> 00:21:16,150
then you can assume that there's some 
commonality between them.

406
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,820
And that can also help you figure out 
how to divide up the brain.

407
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,160
And so that's one of the things that 
Swanson does.

408
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,560
But the other thing he does,
which I really liked,

409
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:27,160
is that instead of looking at the brain 
from the top down,

410
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:27,994
which is what human neuropsychologists 
tend to do because they concentrate on 

411
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:34,540
say language and you know,
higher order cognitive functions,

412
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,793
which we think of as complex,
but you think they're not that damn 

413
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:38,320
complex.

414
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,153
You know,
like a computer can can do mathematics 

415
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,320
so much better than you that there's not
even any comparison.

416
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,480
You know,
and it won't be very long before.

417
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,793
A lot of the things that,
that we think of as abstract cognition 

418
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:52,390
are things that computers are going to 
be able to do,

419
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:53,224
right?
They just want to go tournament for 

420
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:57,160
example.
And the computers are now better.

421
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,180
Even your pc is better at playing chess 
than probably anyone in this room.

422
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,100
And the really high end computers are 
better at playing chess that anyone who,

423
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,410
who lives and so computers are catching 
up damn fast,

424
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:09,244
but you'll notice that they don't do 
things like bus tables in restaurants 

425
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,860
because it turns out that's really hard.
You know,

426
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,540
when you think about it,
it's hard.

427
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,430
You know,
you're carrying different size loads all

428
00:22:18,431 --> 00:22:19,264
the time.
You have to interact socially with 

429
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:21,970
people properly.

430
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,830
You have to stay the hell out of the 
way.

431
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,950
You have to exactly time when you're 
going to come to the table,

432
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,323
you know you have to,
you have to move extraordinarily 

433
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:32,350
efficiently,
especially as the place gets busy.

434
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,453
You know,
there's a lot of demands on you to do 

435
00:22:34,991 --> 00:22:36,490
that job effectively.
And you know,

436
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:40,300
we think about it as a low end job,
but it's not automated.

437
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,260
The low end jobs are the ones that are 
going to be automated first.

438
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:47,980
And it's not obvious that they're going 
to be the things that we associated with

439
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:49,570
low end labor.
You know,

440
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,673
it's just the,
well now like Swanson did with the 

441
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:55,290
nervous system,
I lost,

442
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,163
I was so happy when I found this paper 
because he did exactly with the nervous 

443
00:22:59,141 --> 00:22:59,974
system what piaget did with children.
He showed how the nervous system builds 

444
00:23:04,001 --> 00:23:05,470
itself from the bottom up.

445
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,100
And so Swanson lays right on top of 
piaget.

446
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,053
It's lovely.
And then the other thing that Swanson 

447
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:13,234
does very,
very nicely as he elucidates a lot of 

448
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:18,130
the Friday and presuppositions,
you know,

449
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,090
so Freud of course talk about the Ed and
the Ed is this,

450
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,940
it's sort of like the archaic brain in 
some sense.

451
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:25,774
You know,
it's all where all your primal impulses 

452
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,114
lurk and you know,
he called that one thing that in while 

453
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:32,210
you might say,
well,

454
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,390
is there an IED in the brain?
And the answer is,

455
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:39,130
well,
vaguely,

456
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,330
vaguely,
the,

457
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:46,020
the brain does differ in terms of the,
of the age of it's sub components.

458
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,520
And as you go deeper into the brain and 
closer to the spine,

459
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,773
the brain areas get,
find a genetically older and the more 

460
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,220
Fila,
genetically older areas of the brain,

461
00:23:55,221 --> 00:23:58,700
which are underneath the Cortex,
they have their own little circuits,

462
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,113
you know,
and there's some commonality between 

463
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:01,790
them.

464
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,623
And they do govern primal.
I think of them as primal 

465
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,130
subpersonalities.
It's,

466
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,003
I know we've talked about that before.
It's better than thinking about them as 

467
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:14,210
drives or goals or anything like that.
Because not only do they,

468
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:16,540
do they,
uh,

469
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,050
do they,
they're,

470
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,300
they're like sets of associated 
behaviors,

471
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,223
but they're not just that.
There are also ways of looking at the 

472
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:25,700
world and ways of thinking about the 
world.

473
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,070
So you know,
if you're angry,

474
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,880
it's not like you're,
you're being driven to use your fists.

475
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:32,714
That's not how it works.
What happens is that the angry 

476
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,800
subpersonality comes out,
you know,

477
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:39,050
and it does a whole bunch of things.
You know,

478
00:24:39,051 --> 00:24:39,884
it's got its own state of arousal.
It's characterized both by positive and 

479
00:24:43,221 --> 00:24:45,680
negative emotion,
which is something that's quite peculiar

480
00:24:45,681 --> 00:24:46,514
about anger because it's both a 
defensive reaction and an aggressive 

481
00:24:49,851 --> 00:24:51,710
forward moving behavior.

482
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,620
And it has a viewpoint,
like it's a biased viewpoint.

483
00:24:54,621 --> 00:24:55,454
If you're angry with someone,
all you can see about them is how damn 

484
00:24:57,831 --> 00:25:00,500
irritating they are and how much they 
need to be defeated,

485
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,820
you know,
roughly speaking.

486
00:25:01,821 --> 00:25:04,670
And so it's a whole personality.
Now.

487
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:07,610
It's a one dimensional personality cause
all it's really,

488
00:25:07,611 --> 00:25:11,720
God is anger and that's not enough to 
solve every problem.

489
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,780
But you can't think about it as a drive.
Exactly.

490
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:16,880
Because it's also because it's not 
deterministic.

491
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,100
You know,
it's even when you're angry,

492
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,473
you have a range of choices to make.
Now there are circumscribed by the fact 

493
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:25,460
that you're angry,
you know,

494
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,940
but,
but it's best to think about it as a sub

495
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:29,774
personality.
I think you just get a lot farther that 

496
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:33,200
way.
Now what Swanson did,

497
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,020
you know how Piaget talked about 
children,

498
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:36,883
infants,
they start out with a few fundamental 

499
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:39,440
reflexes,
right?

500
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,920
That they're sort of born with,
including the ability to use their mouth

501
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:44,600
and they're telling me as an 
exploratory,

502
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,550
uh,
device,

503
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,833
and then they have certain reflexes that
they can manifest right away and then 

504
00:25:50,481 --> 00:25:53,150
they have the ability to modify those 
reflexes.

505
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,960
And so as far as piaget was concerned,
that was enough to get the ball rolling.

506
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,290
It was sort of like the child was 
booting up across time.

507
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,430
It's got some,
you know,

508
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,593
outside of the operating system,
you've got some bare processes in your 

509
00:26:05,991 --> 00:26:09,620
computer that get it started enough so 
the operating system can turn on.

510
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:12,080
It sort of unfolds up into something 
complex.

511
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,153
Well,
that's sort of what human beings do 

512
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:17,060
across time.
They start out with these basic reflexes

513
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,553
that are simple movements and then they 
learn how to modify the movements and 

514
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:23,090
then they learn how to chain the 
movements together.

515
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,133
And then they learn how to use the chain
movements as tools in some sense as 

516
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:30,800
embodied tools to pursue,
to,

517
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:36,250
to allow these biologically determined 
subpersonalities to operate in the world

518
00:26:36,621 --> 00:26:39,170
with some chance of success.
Okay.

519
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,033
Now and you can,
you can layer that on to the nervous 

520
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,650
system.
So partly what's happening when you get,

521
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,310
when you get these basic movements down,
the ones that are now automatic,

522
00:26:47,311 --> 00:26:50,010
like your ability to grip the,
your ability to,

523
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:52,380
you know,
do this with your hands and all the,

524
00:26:52,381 --> 00:26:54,870
all the basic sub routines you have with
your body.

525
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,273
Those are automatized.
They're made into little machines and a 

526
00:26:58,261 --> 00:27:01,530
lot of them run spinally.
So you know,

527
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:04,650
because what you think in some sense is 
that if you're walking,

528
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,690
you're thinking about walking in some 
way,

529
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:08,790
that's how you walk.
It's like that's not right.

530
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,653
What happens is you orient yourself to,
to a goal and in some sense you just 

531
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,214
disinhibit the system that knows how to 
walk and then it more or less does it 

532
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,833
automatically and you know,
you direct it and you can modify what 

533
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:23,940
it's doing if there's an error,
but you kind of know that,

534
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:24,180
right?

535
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,970
You drive to to school and you drive 
somewhere you're familiar to,

536
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,980
you don't even even necessarily remember
the drive if you've done it 50 times.

537
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,933
It's cause you're basically in some 
sense you just sequencing automated 

538
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:37,764
behaviors and a good thing too because 
if you didn't have those automated 

539
00:27:41,071 --> 00:27:43,590
expert behaviors at hand,
you,

540
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,800
you wouldn't know how to drive because 
it's,

541
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,303
you're just not smart.
You know the time when you drive most 

542
00:27:50,611 --> 00:27:52,800
consciously is when you first learned 
how to drive.

543
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,590
Well,
you don't want a conscious driver.

544
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,873
You want an unconscious expert driver 
whose consciousness is monitoring the 

545
00:28:00,361 --> 00:28:03,000
world for anything unexpected.
That's what you want.

546
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,313
So,
and that's the case for almost 

547
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:05,664
everything you do.
If you have to become conscious of what 

548
00:28:08,191 --> 00:28:09,024
you're doing,
the probability that you don't do it 

549
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:11,460
very well,
it's really high.

550
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:12,563
And you know that because maybe you're 
talking to someone happens when I'm 

551
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,420
lecturing.

552
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,790
Sometimes you know,
if I'm not really on top of things,

553
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:18,624
I'll get self conscious.
And that's a terrible thing to have 

554
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:22,050
happen when you lecture,
you know,

555
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,480
just makes you stumble.
If it's going well,

556
00:28:24,481 --> 00:28:27,210
I know where I'm going and I'd have all 
these little routines,

557
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,343
you know,
that our stories and things that I know 

558
00:28:29,701 --> 00:28:34,380
that they just automatically sequence.
All I have to do is point the lecture in

559
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:36,150
the right direction.
And you know,

560
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,520
the things that are logically associated
with,

561
00:28:38,521 --> 00:28:39,630
uh,
with the,

562
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:43,770
the direction of the lecture will,
they'll come up there,

563
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,663
they're primed in some sense.
And so Swanson helped me understand the 

564
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:52,380
functions of the lower part of the brain
quite well.

565
00:28:52,381 --> 00:28:53,214
And then to map that on to piaget.
And one of the things he helped me 

566
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:56,304
understand was just exactly how 
sophisticated the lower parts of the 

567
00:28:59,431 --> 00:28:59,970
brain are.

568
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:04,970
The more automatic parts.
Now the behavior is used to believe that

569
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:05,844
or did believe and still believe to some
degree that a lot of your behavior is 

570
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:09,954
reflexive.
And the radical behavior is the guys 

571
00:29:12,391 --> 00:29:13,224
from the 50s but more or less made the 
case that even complex behavior among 

572
00:29:17,011 --> 00:29:21,060
animals is nothing but the chaining 
together of automatic reflexes.

573
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,630
So it was deterministic chain of,
of reflexes.

574
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,780
Well you do have reflex actions,
you know,

575
00:29:27,781 --> 00:29:28,614
so if you touch a hot stove,
you'll jerk your hand away and your 

576
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,394
brain isn't involved in that.
It's just your spinal cord that's 

577
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:35,124
involved in that.
Now your brain's involved when the pain 

578
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:40,740
hits and maybe that's so that you 
stopped doing it in the future,

579
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:41,883
but you're,
the conscious part of your brain is too 

580
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:45,580
slow to get your hand away from the,
you know,

581
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,690
from the stove and time.

582
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:51,400
And so what's happening in your body in 
some senses that you have these multiple

583
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:56,120
layers of neurological organization and 
some of them are quite fixed there.

584
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,470
They're automatic deterministic systems 
and those are things you really,

585
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:02,950
really practiced and that you could just
run as a routine.

586
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,203
And then above that are the,
are those things that you chained 

587
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:06,784
together but they could be chained 
together in different ways so they're 

588
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:11,710
less automatized.
And then if you keep going up,

589
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:16,740
they get more and more complex and less 
automatized until out the top,

590
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,270
which is where your consciousness is 
roughly speaking,

591
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,030
you're,
you have to program what you're doing.

592
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,223
You know when you have to pay very 
careful attention to how to go about 

593
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:28,900
doing this because you don't have the 
systems built into you.

594
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,280
So you know what that's like.
If you're trying to learn something new,

595
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,890
it takes a lot of energy and you really 
have to pay a 10 pay attention.

596
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,440
And then once you start to get it,
you know,

597
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,423
well there's phase.
What really happens is those things you 

598
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:46,600
don't have to think about anymore.
And thank God for that because you know,

599
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:47,434
first of all you can't think that much 
cause you're a pretty limited capacity 

600
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:54,040
process or in second,
the programming is quite difficult.

601
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,810
Okay.
So,

602
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,300
okay,

603
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,310
so let's see here.
What I've got.

604
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,430
Yeah,
that's what,

605
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,320
okay,
so if you look on the right there,

606
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,633
there's a little diagram that's a 
hierarchical die or a little table 

607
00:31:28,311 --> 00:31:31,370
really.
And it's talking about the motor system.

608
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,473
Now the motor system is
what allows you to output action and 

609
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,893
like you're out putting action at all 
sorts of levels that you don't even 

610
00:31:40,611 --> 00:31:41,444
realize because you know,
you might think that that site is a 

611
00:31:43,761 --> 00:31:45,860
sensory activity,
for example,

612
00:31:45,861 --> 00:31:46,694
but that there's a very tight 
relationship between sensory activity 

613
00:31:50,331 --> 00:31:52,070
and motor activity.
So for example,

614
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,173
when you're looking at a scene,
even though you don't know what your 

615
00:31:54,771 --> 00:31:55,604
eyes are going like this,
and the reason they're going like that 

616
00:31:57,951 --> 00:31:58,784
is because if you held your eyes 
absolutely still and you can actually 

617
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,770
learn to do this,
if you hold your eyes absolutely still,

618
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,050
your vision will fade right out and you 
won't see anything.

619
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,270
And it's because the little neuro,
the little,

620
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:09,104
uh,
retinal cells that are picking up the 

621
00:32:10,941 --> 00:32:12,080
light get exhausted.

622
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,130
And so then they stopped transmitting.
And so part of the reason you're zipping

623
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,510
your eyes back and forth is so that,
you know,

624
00:32:17,511 --> 00:32:18,344
different parts of your,
I can process the scene and it doesn't 

625
00:32:20,841 --> 00:32:24,050
get exhausted.
And plus you're also looking around,

626
00:32:24,051 --> 00:32:26,180
you know,
and you're looking at when things move,

627
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,130
you know,
you direct your attention to that.

628
00:32:28,131 --> 00:32:28,964
Or if someone makes a gesture.
So you're actually kind of using your 

629
00:32:31,761 --> 00:32:33,680
eyes like tentacles,
you know,

630
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,400
to,
to,

631
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,860
to check out the information that's 
coated in the light and,

632
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,120
and even when you're here and that sort 
of thing,

633
00:32:41,121 --> 00:32:43,460
there's a fair bit of motor activity 
associated with it.

634
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,294
You turn your head unconsciously and 
there's all sorts of little motor 

635
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:49,010
actions in your ear that also helps you 
tune in.

636
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:51,140
And so those things are tightly 
associated.

637
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:55,730
But roughly speaking,
the motor output is action.

638
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,553
And then Swanson shows that there are 
these layers in the nervous system that 

639
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:04,250
go from the spinal cord upward.

640
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:05,863
The first ones are the somatic motor 
neuron pools and the second are 

641
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:09,434
locomotor pattern generators in the 
third are locomotor pattern initiators 

642
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:18,050
and then the fourth r locomotor pattern 
controllers to hire.

643
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,913
So,
and the way to kind of lay piaget on it 

644
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:21,644
in some senses,
to think of the somatic motor neuron 

645
00:33:23,991 --> 00:33:28,991
pools as simple actions that can be 
implemented automatically.

646
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:35,380
And then the locomotor pattern generator
has taken those simple actions and chain

647
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:40,430
them into relatively more complex 
melodies of action.

648
00:33:40,431 --> 00:33:45,431
So kinetic melodies and then the 
locomotor pattern initiator,

649
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:46,483
more or less decides when those 
Connecticut Maliki should be 

650
00:33:48,771 --> 00:33:50,990
implemented.
And even that can be unconscious.

651
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,890
And then so it's still at that level of 
brain organization.

652
00:33:54,891 --> 00:33:55,724
It's still more or less automatic even 
stimulus response as a way to think 

653
00:33:58,401 --> 00:33:59,234
about it.
And then you go one level higher and 

654
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:05,660
that's where you get the ability to 
voluntarily use these automated things.

655
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,060
So I could show you an example of how 
this works.

656
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:08,894
So this is called a ballistic movement.
So I'm going to take my hand and I'm 

657
00:34:13,461 --> 00:34:16,520
going to bring it down really fast,
right towards that edge.

658
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,533
Okay,
so

659
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,470
all right now.
So that's very fast movement.

660
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,900
Now,
one of the things that's cool about that

661
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:28,760
movement is that I don't have time.
Once that action starts,

662
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,720
it happens so fast that it's done.
By the time the,

663
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,913
the,
uh,

664
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,560
information about the action actually 
gets to my brain.

665
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,740
So I actually,
once I let that go,

666
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:43,580
I can't control it.
What I basically am doing is

667
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:45,943
disinhibiting the motor control systems 
that are already have established in my 

668
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:51,973
psychophysiological being.
I'm disinhibiting one of those and then 

669
00:34:55,401 --> 00:34:56,234
it runs automatically.
And so that's what you're doing all the 

670
00:34:58,641 --> 00:35:02,810
time when you're,
when you're acting in life and it's,

671
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:03,644
it's kind of a neat,
I wrote a paper a while back with an 

672
00:35:05,151 --> 00:35:05,984
undergraduate student of who's who's a,
he was a pretty break character and we 

673
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:11,660
got invited to do a paper.

674
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,000
I got invited to do a paper on free 
will.

675
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,600
And so we were thinking about free will,
you know,

676
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,443
and it's very interesting to think about
freewill in relationship to these 

677
00:35:20,361 --> 00:35:21,194
hierarchies because it sort of goes like
this is that out there in the future 

678
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,653
you've got free will,
but as the future moves towards the 

679
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:31,130
present,
you don't like,

680
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,870
once it gets close enough to the 
present,

681
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,920
you have to have initiated something 
automatic that will happen.

682
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:41,460
And so I can give you an example.
People who play the piano very well,

683
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:46,490
they look ahead of where they're playing
in the music because they know how to do

684
00:35:47,851 --> 00:35:49,050
this.
They don't have to think about it.

685
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,913
What they have to do is look ahead so 
that the part of them that knows how to 

686
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:55,920
do this gets ready to do it.
And all of you are experts in that way.

687
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,753
Likely all of those of you who drive,
you're also experts that way because 

688
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,980
when you're driving,
where do you look?

689
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,533
If you're a good driver on the highway,
you look like at least half a second or 

690
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:08,400
a second ahead.
Why?

691
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,743
Well,
because 50 feet ahead has already 

692
00:36:11,341 --> 00:36:12,990
happened,
right?

693
00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:15,630
It's too close in time for you to do 
anything about it.

694
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,464
So basically what you're doing is you're
looking at the road and then you're 

695
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:20,723
disinhibiting sequences of action that 
are the ones that are going to 

696
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:27,120
correspond to what you want to do with 
the road most,

697
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,850
most adequately.
And as you know,

698
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,820
the closer you get to executing one of 
those motor behaviors,

699
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:36,750
the more automatic automated it is.
So by the time you manifest the action,

700
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,270
there's no free there at all.
But you are,

701
00:36:39,271 --> 00:36:41,850
you said enough to be released in some 
sense.

702
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,230
So I could say,
well,

703
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,110
this isn't,
there's no freewill in that.

704
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,290
But there was in deciding to do it at 
that point.

705
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:55,010
So and so that's sort of how your auto 
automaticity meets your freedom,

706
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,563
you know,
got to think about it as something 

707
00:36:57,031 --> 00:36:59,430
extending across time.
So,

708
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,840
okay,
so having established that,

709
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:07,410
then we're going to get into the,
the uh,

710
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,230
the more,
uh,

711
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,580
neurological localization a little bit.
So you might say,

712
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,863
well,
you collect all these patterns of 

713
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:19,050
behavior and then you automate them into
routines.

714
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,600
I could give you an example.
So for a child,

715
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:23,130
you know,
when a child first comes,

716
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,053
when a child is first born,
do you tap on the cheek and we'll go 

717
00:37:25,981 --> 00:37:28,950
like this.
It's called a rooting reflex and it will

718
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:30,990
move its mouth and tongue.
Well,

719
00:37:30,991 --> 00:37:32,910
what it's doing,
roughly speaking,

720
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:35,330
is searching for a nipple.
And if you just put your finger there,

721
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:38,040
then clamp onto that and start to suck.

722
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,060
And so the child comes out with that 
ability and that's a reflex.

723
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:42,894
It's sort of built into the neurology.
But then when the child starts to 

724
00:37:46,321 --> 00:37:48,570
interact with the mother to actually 
breastfeed,

725
00:37:48,571 --> 00:37:49,404
well then that initial reflex has to be 
modified quite substantially in the 

726
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:56,550
context of the relationship with the 
mother.

727
00:37:56,551 --> 00:37:59,940
Because the bear reflex,
it's enough to get the thing going,

728
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:00,774
but it's not enough to make it work.
And so often mothers take a fair bit of 

729
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:07,800
time to learn how to breastfeed,
but it's also because the baby is taking

730
00:38:07,801 --> 00:38:09,390
a fair bit of time to learn how to do 
it.

731
00:38:09,391 --> 00:38:13,260
So they have to establish the dance that
goes with that.

732
00:38:13,261 --> 00:38:15,390
And one of the things that's quite cool 
about,

733
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,610
about that dance,
so to speak,

734
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:18,444
is there's been studies done of 
depressed and non depressed mothers 

735
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,253
interacting with their infants.
And so if you take a non depressed 

736
00:38:24,931 --> 00:38:28,890
mother interacting with their infant and
you just film them and then you speed up

737
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:31,230
the film,
you can see like the mothers,

738
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,460
the baby reacts and above the reaction,
the baby reacts and the mother reacts.

739
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,650
It's like a dance,
you know,

740
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:38,650
there's this continual flow of 
information between the two of them.

741
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,660
And if the babies with a depressed 
mother,

742
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:42,670
that doesn't happen.
It's Jerky and,

743
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,990
and discontinuous.
And so if you think about that,

744
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,820
you can see how the,
you know,

745
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:49,654
the dialectical interaction between the 
mother and child is building up the 

746
00:38:52,781 --> 00:38:53,614
child's repertoire of,
of complex abilities within a social 

747
00:38:58,391 --> 00:38:59,350
context.
You know,

748
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:00,184
I mean,
I know I told you guys before the 

749
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,330
roughly speaking that,
you know,

750
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,030
kids really get socialized to play with 
each other,

751
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,100
you know,
between two and four.

752
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,630
But that's not exactly true because even
the lower level,

753
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:18,430
more automated and more primordial 
reflex behaviors,

754
00:39:18,431 --> 00:39:19,211
you know,
like,

755
00:39:19,211 --> 00:39:21,400
like the ones that are associated with 
breastfeeding,

756
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,980
even those developed under the 
constraints of a,

757
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:29,140
of social guidelines.
So society's always there right from the

758
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:30,310
reflex level up.

759
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:31,563
But you know,
what happens when kids are between two 

760
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,890
and four is they have to learn to 
actually play.

761
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,000
They have to learn how to play complex 
games with other children.

762
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:41,710
And so that's a whole,
that involves,

763
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:42,544
you know,
communication and negotiation had a 

764
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:47,320
verbal level and,
and also with people their own age.

765
00:39:47,321 --> 00:39:48,154
So you know,
it's continuous in some sense of 

766
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,660
discontinuous.
And in another sense,

767
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,920
okay,
so anyways,

768
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:54,581
you might say,
well,

769
00:39:54,581 --> 00:39:58,210
why do you bother straining all these 
things together and well,

770
00:39:58,211 --> 00:40:00,150
you think about the breastfeeding 
issues,

771
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,023
well,
why does it baby bothered to learn how 

772
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:02,800
to breastfeed?
Well,

773
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,270
that's pretty obvious,
isn't it?

774
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,470
I mean,
first of all,

775
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:08,110
if it doesn't,
then it doesn't live,

776
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,211
you know,
and,

777
00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:12,400
and there's a bunch of reasons for that.
It's like one is obviously it's good not

778
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:14,740
going to be nourished properly,
although you know,

779
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,690
there are things you can do to 
substitute for that.

780
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:20,560
Although still breastfeeding still seems
to be the best thing you can do for your

781
00:40:20,561 --> 00:40:21,940
baby.
Um,

782
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,953
although you can work around it,
but fundamentally it seems to be the 

783
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:25,774
best thing that you could do.
But then the babies also learning all 

784
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:28,624
sorts of other things,
like it's got skin to skin contact and 

785
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:33,670
it snuggling and it's being comforted 
and it's doing eye gaze,

786
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,563
eye gaze,
and it's cooling and the mother's 

787
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,303
imitating it and it's like,
there's just a lot of things going on 

788
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:39,274
there.
And so the child is organizing all of 

789
00:40:41,761 --> 00:40:45,250
that partly to fulfill a basic 
biological need,

790
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,800
which is post two needs both thirst and 
hunger,

791
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,770
but it's also fulfilling its need for 
play for example,

792
00:40:50,771 --> 00:40:53,270
because children have a circuit for 
place.

793
00:40:53,271 --> 00:40:58,030
So you could say play as part of the ID.
It's a fundamental biological need.

794
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:02,140
The other thing children have to have is
skin to skin touch.

795
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,990
They'll die without it.
It's not optional.

796
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,993
You even see that in rats.
So if you take a rat pop away from its 

797
00:41:08,981 --> 00:41:12,190
mother and you feed it,
but you don't do anything with it,

798
00:41:12,191 --> 00:41:13,270
it just dies.
It's,

799
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,760
it goes into opiate overdose,
roughly speaking,

800
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:18,700
it's gastrointestinal system shutdown 
and then it dies.

801
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,330
And you can stop that from happening by 
isolating it,

802
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,193
feeding it,
and then like massaging it with the 

803
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,200
pencil,
with the eraser,

804
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:28,960
end of a pencil.
You can keep the rat pup alive.

805
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,183
And uh,
Jaak Panksepp was one of the people who 

806
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,150
either discovered that over,
worked on it.

807
00:41:34,151 --> 00:41:37,740
And that work was extended by Tiffany 
Fields at,

808
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,400
uh,
in a hospital in Florida.

809
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,263
Some really brilliant work.
She was looking at Panksepp's work on 

810
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:47,590
the necessity of tactile stimulation.
And uh,

811
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:48,471
she thought,
hey,

812
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:51,230
I bet we could try that with premature 
babies cause you know,

813
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:54,050
if a baby's premature,
couple of things are problems.

814
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,010
I mean,
first of all,

815
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,000
at the end of the term pregnancies are 
nuts when babies late on fat,

816
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,160
you know,
so they come out and they're sort of,

817
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,023
they've got some storage storage there 
in case things don't get going very 

818
00:42:05,001 --> 00:42:05,834
well,
you know,

819
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,810
and they're gaining a lot of weight to 
not last period of pregnancy.

820
00:42:08,811 --> 00:42:12,020
So if they come up with premature then 
they're really skinny.

821
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,770
And then what happens often is they 
start to lose weight and that's not good

822
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:18,470
because they should be ramping up the 
weight gain really quick.

823
00:42:18,471 --> 00:42:21,320
Like a newborn baby.
They outgrew its closed at one week.

824
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,910
You know,
those things are there,

825
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:23,913
they're gaining weight quickly to do the
premature babies lose weight and you 

826
00:42:27,261 --> 00:42:28,970
know,
it's hard to keep them going.

827
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,790
They put them in an incubator,
they feed them.

828
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,960
But what tiffany feel dead was,
she had the nurses go in there,

829
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,423
you know,
with with gloves and massage the babies 

830
00:42:39,561 --> 00:42:41,100
for 10 minutes,
three times a day.

831
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,933
And those babies gained weight as fast 
as babies that were still in utero and 

832
00:42:45,651 --> 00:42:49,190
you could still detect the differences 
in their development six months later,

833
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,710
which in baby terms is like forever,
right?

834
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,813
I mean you change as much from zero 
months to six months as you probably do 

835
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:59,660
from six months to 20 years old.
It's such a radical transformation.

836
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,370
So,
okay.

837
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:06,380
The reason I'm telling you all this is 
because you lay out these hierarchies of

838
00:43:06,561 --> 00:43:07,394
behavior that are,
well an automatized had brought under 

839
00:43:09,861 --> 00:43:13,880
the control of social conditioning,
but you really do them in the service of

840
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:15,003
of well that's,
that's the question in the service of 

841
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:21,620
we'll say biological necessity for the 
sake of argument.

842
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,450
Well you have to eat and you have to 
drink.

843
00:43:23,451 --> 00:43:24,284
And so one of the,
one of the reasons you lay out the 

844
00:43:26,331 --> 00:43:28,820
hierarchy that's associated with 
breastfeeding,

845
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:29,654
and so you can do that directly,
but also so that you can establish a 

846
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:36,740
relationship so that not only are you 
doing it directly this day,

847
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,070
but you're also going to do it,
you know,

848
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,300
tomorrow and the next day and the day 
after that.

849
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,730
And so the hunger system is integrated 
with these other systems of,

850
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,673
of biological constraint in some sense.
And they're trying to come up with an 

851
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:56,171
answer to the continual problem.
So you have dedicated biological systems

852
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,200
that help you address problems that are 
associated with your biological nature,

853
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:05,420
that are universal.
And those would be the things that Freud

854
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:09,710
would describe as the end.
So you can think of these hierarchies of

855
00:44:09,711 --> 00:44:10,544
motor behavior,
which sort of develop into 

856
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:16,190
subpersonalities as nested in some 
sense,

857
00:44:16,191 --> 00:44:17,024
inside motivational states.
So there's the motor behavior hierarchy 

858
00:44:22,431 --> 00:44:23,264
that use when you're angry,
there's a motor behavior hierarchy you 

859
00:44:25,181 --> 00:44:28,700
use when you're distressed.
And kids get very good at that,

860
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:30,290
you know,
so they'll cry,

861
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:33,990
which is a reflex.
But by the time they're about to,

862
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,630
they're pretty damn good at crying.
You know,

863
00:44:36,631 --> 00:44:37,464
they've got a,
they've got a cry that sounds like 

864
00:44:38,731 --> 00:44:40,470
they're sad and upset when they're 
really angry.

865
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:42,023
And so if you really listen,
you can hear the difference because a 

866
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,550
baby angry baby sounds different than a 
sad baby.

867
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,270
But if you don't listen to baby,
you'll have you think and it's sad,

868
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:53,400
no problem.
Then you'll feel sorry for it and go,

869
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:54,160
you know,
help it out.

870
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,370
Really,
it's just thinking up years,

871
00:44:56,371 --> 00:44:59,640
you know?
So we know this partly because,

872
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,330
so let's say you've got a baby and it's 
under nine months,

873
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,193
six months old,
and it's crying and it's critical to 

874
00:45:05,571 --> 00:45:06,121
think,
well what,

875
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:06,954
what should you do?
He'd go in there and he'd pick up the 

876
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:08,604
baby and you comforted and you probably 
do that pretty much nonstop when the 

877
00:45:11,851 --> 00:45:13,020
babies that young,
you know,

878
00:45:13,021 --> 00:45:13,854
because they're so young,
they should really still be in uteral 

879
00:45:15,541 --> 00:45:16,500
there.
They're really young.

880
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,530
But by nine months that may be starting 
to get smart.

881
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:24,210
And so it's about nine months when it 
can visually recognize people that knows

882
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:28,680
and people it,
people here she doesn't know and so then

883
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:30,203
the babies in there and it's you know,
squawking a bit and so want some 

884
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:33,864
attention and then someone walks in and 
it's not the mother and the baby bursts 

885
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:37,554
into terrorists and people think all 
that baby's all sad because it's mother 

886
00:45:39,961 --> 00:45:40,500
didn't show up.

887
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,333
It's like it's not sad.
It's really irritated that the wrong 

888
00:45:43,831 --> 00:45:44,664
person showed up.
And you can tell that because people 

889
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:47,454
have done facial coding of the baby's 
expression and also it's skin tone and 

890
00:45:51,241 --> 00:45:54,330
an angry baby looks angry first of all 
and it turns all red.

891
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:55,164
It's like it's really angry and you see 
that behavior later too and temper 

892
00:45:58,471 --> 00:45:59,304
tantrums like a two year old.
That sounding a temper tantrum is just 

893
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:06,660
having a fit of rage.
The rage system,

894
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,050
because there is a rage system is just 
completely out of control.

895
00:46:10,051 --> 00:46:12,480
It's just absolutely dominating their 
behavior.

896
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:13,314
And you don't really want to encourage 
that because the rage system should 

897
00:46:16,801 --> 00:46:21,510
start to be modulated by other systems 
and other higher order control systems.

898
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:22,463
Not so much suppressed or repressed,
which is sort of how the Friday comes 

899
00:46:25,021 --> 00:46:25,854
with thing,
but integrated into more complex and 

900
00:46:27,961 --> 00:46:31,860
sophisticated modes of action so the 
child can use its anger,

901
00:46:31,861 --> 00:46:34,990
which is an extraordinary and useful 
capacity,

902
00:46:34,991 --> 00:46:36,690
you know,
because it allows you to defend yourself

903
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:41,070
so the child can learn to use that in a 
sophisticated way so that they can solve

904
00:46:41,071 --> 00:46:45,810
the problems that would lead to a range 
attack without ever getting to the point

905
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:47,610
where it has to be enraged,
right?

906
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:50,250
That's a functional child.
It's not like it's learned to repress,

907
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:51,084
it's anger,
it's just that it gets along with 

908
00:46:51,991 --> 00:46:53,550
people.
It never has to get angry.

909
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,050
So now some kids learn to repress the 
ranger because you know,

910
00:46:58,051 --> 00:46:58,884
they're in a household where any 
manifestation of anger is dealt with 

911
00:47:03,001 --> 00:47:04,080
very,
very harshly.

912
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,153
You know?
And maybe there's a rule that everyone 

913
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:08,490
has to be nice to each other all of the 
time,

914
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,580
you know,
or else sort of a paradoxical rule.

915
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:13,283
But anyways,
you can imagine now there's a lot of 

916
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:15,534
these biological systems.
And so I want to show you some of their 

917
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,390
instantiation here.
So let's look at this one.

918
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:25,020
So when you get up above the spinal 
cord,

919
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:28,620
there's a little brain area I'll show 
you about how big it is.

920
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,230
There it is.
So there's your brain,

921
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:33,170
the,
the,

922
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:35,830
the top on part of a part on top.

923
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:36,813
That's the cerebral cortex.
That's the part that people are really 

924
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:40,030
proud of it.
It's like,

925
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:41,920
Oh wow,
look at our cerebral cortex.

926
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:42,900
You don't,
it doesn't,

927
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:46,570
it have a lot of neurons.
And then in the middle there,

928
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:47,573
um,
there are older brain areas and find a 

929
00:47:49,631 --> 00:47:50,464
genetically old.
And then as you go down towards the 

930
00:47:51,611 --> 00:47:52,444
spinal cord,
they basically get older and older and 

931
00:47:53,531 --> 00:47:55,270
older and older.
So,

932
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:59,230
and more and more
critical to your development.

933
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,064
So the serotonin system,
we talked about it a little bit in 

934
00:48:01,601 --> 00:48:02,434
lobsters,
right?

935
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,333
Serotonin system is the thing that sort 
of determines where a lobster is in the 

936
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:10,600
dominance hierarchy determines whether 
it stands like this or whether it stands

937
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:12,760
like this.
That's an old system.

938
00:48:12,761 --> 00:48:15,010
And when your brain is developing in 
Utero,

939
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,800
it's a serotonin system that guides its 
development.

940
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:18,873
So that's how important it is.
It's sort of like the conductor of the 

941
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:21,934
orchestra,
but it's also the thing that controls 

942
00:48:24,851 --> 00:48:28,150
the entire unfolding of the brain and it
comes from,

943
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:29,440
you know,
really,

944
00:48:29,441 --> 00:48:32,040
really it's a really,
really archaic systems.

945
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,780
So in some sense you're,
you're,

946
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:35,643
you're being is controlled by these 
things that are ancient beyond 

947
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:39,640
comprehension,
you know.

948
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,050
Um,
anyways,

949
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:42,370
you looked at the hypothalamus,
you think,

950
00:48:42,371 --> 00:48:43,720
wow,
that's not very big.

951
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:45,580
And uh,
yeah,

952
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:49,540
it's not,
but if you take a cat and you,

953
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:50,403
so cat green looks something like that,
if you take off all the stuff that's in 

954
00:48:53,741 --> 00:48:54,574
light orange and most of the top of the 
stuff above the hypothalamus that's in 

955
00:48:57,881 --> 00:49:01,390
white,
just take all that out and it's a female

956
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:02,224
cat and it's in a cage.
You really can't tell the difference 

957
00:49:04,031 --> 00:49:06,970
between eight and a cap that has all the
rest of that brain.

958
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:08,283
Now there's some things that can't do.
It doesn't do very well if you take it 

959
00:49:11,111 --> 00:49:14,390
into a new situation cause it can't 
learn more,

960
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:17,230
more important in some sense.
He can't remember.

961
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,753
So it's enough perpetual state of 
everything happening for the very first 

962
00:49:21,941 --> 00:49:22,774
time,
but it's still capable of a lot of the 

963
00:49:24,431 --> 00:49:27,370
reactions that would be necessary in 
order for you to stay alive.

964
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:30,640
So it can regulate its liquid intake,
can regulate its food intake,

965
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:34,660
it can react sexually.
It's capable of defensive aggression,

966
00:49:34,661 --> 00:49:35,494
although it'll really fly into a rage.
And so it's kind of like a disinhibited 

967
00:49:38,681 --> 00:49:40,330
two year old in some sense,
you know,

968
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,340
and uh,
you know,

969
00:49:42,341 --> 00:49:44,920
as long as you keep it in the cage and 
provide it with food and water,

970
00:49:44,921 --> 00:49:48,760
it's like the way it lives.
And it's hyper exploratory,

971
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,130
which I think is just weird beyond 
belief.

972
00:49:51,131 --> 00:49:54,460
It's like you take the brain off a cap 
and then all it wants to do is explore,

973
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,593
which is not what you think at all.
It's like a cat with no brain is really 

974
00:49:58,481 --> 00:50:00,970
curious.
It just doesn't make sense.

975
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,043
But it does actually because the systems
that drive your exploratory urge are 

976
00:50:06,251 --> 00:50:10,120
rooted in a hypothalamus and they're 
actually the same systems.

977
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:11,520
The it,
it's,

978
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:12,363
it's,
uh,

979
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:13,443
individual differences in the function 
and sensitivity of those systems that 

980
00:50:16,421 --> 00:50:19,570
are in part associated with individual 
differences and extroversion.

981
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,013
So extroverts,
a sort of hyper exploratory and social 

982
00:50:22,781 --> 00:50:24,970
situations,
whereas introverts aren't.

983
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:26,223
And the exploratory that that has its 
origins in the hypothalamus runs on 

984
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:32,600
dopamine,
roughly speaking,

985
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,960
and then it runs through the base of 
your brain and then up into your,

986
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,540
up into your prefrontal cortex in 
particular.

987
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:39,703
And it's also the system that responds 
to cocaine and amphetamines and other 

988
00:50:42,591 --> 00:50:46,400
drugs that people liked to take because 
they heightened positive emotion.

989
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:49,850
So,
so it's very ability at a very,

990
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:50,684
very low level in the brain that that 
determines things like the differences 

991
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:57,460
in extroverts and introverts.
So anyways,

992
00:50:57,461 --> 00:51:00,080
it's this tiny little part of the brain 
yet,

993
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,690
you know,
if that's all you have,

994
00:51:02,691 --> 00:51:04,160
you can get along.
Not too bad.

995
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,810
Um,
so,

996
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:10,070
but that's also because it's tiny from 
one level of analysis,

997
00:51:10,071 --> 00:51:12,650
but it's really big from another,
you know,

998
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:15,440
I mean,
you can,

999
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:16,423
you can increase your resolution when 
you're doing brain analysis all the way 

1000
00:51:18,981 --> 00:51:22,670
down to the molecular level and still be
looking at the brain,

1001
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:24,800
you know,
below the molecular level.

1002
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:26,480
At the atomic level.
It's sort of,

1003
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,130
well,
everything's made out of atoms,

1004
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,473
but the brain is already there at a 
molecular level and it's insanely 

1005
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:33,374
complicated at a molecular level.
And the hypothalamus is way bigger than 

1006
00:51:37,101 --> 00:51:37,934
a molecule.
And so even though it's small compared 

1007
00:51:40,341 --> 00:51:41,174
to the rest of our brain,
it's still a whopping big structure by 

1008
00:51:44,151 --> 00:51:44,984
atomic standards.
And so there's a hell of a lot going on 

1009
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:48,560
down there.
And you notice the Hypothalamus,

1010
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,401
you might say,
well,

1011
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:50,630
is there such a,
he said,

1012
00:51:50,631 --> 00:51:52,100
is there such a thing as the ID?

1013
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,793
Well,

1014
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,240
yes,
no.

1015
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,210
Is it in the brain?
Yes and no.

1016
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,120
Really low resolution representation of 
what's in the brain.

1017
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,870
That's one way of thinking about it.
But then you might say,

1018
00:52:05,871 --> 00:52:07,400
well,
is there a hypothalamus?

1019
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,050
And the answer to that is,
well,

1020
00:52:09,051 --> 00:52:09,884
yes and no because there's the 
hypothalamic structure and you see it's 

1021
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:14,960
made out of a bunch of things that are 
different.

1022
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:16,243
And so you could say,
well should you even group those things 

1023
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:19,040
together?
Well,

1024
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:22,250
the answer to that is it depends on why 
you're grouping them together.

1025
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:23,203
You know,
if it's useful for some purpose of 

1026
00:52:24,981 --> 00:52:27,770
understanding or control to group them 
together.

1027
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,550
I mean they're,
they,

1028
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:30,443
they,
they are similar in the way that they 

1029
00:52:31,821 --> 00:52:32,654
emerge in the course of brain 
development and the roughly of the same 

1030
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:35,684
file or genetic age.
But there's lots of reasons to treat 

1031
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:38,834
them as the same.
And there's lots of reasons to treat 

1032
00:52:40,131 --> 00:52:40,964
them as different.
It depends on what you're trying to do 

1033
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:45,920
anyways.
The hypothalamus has all these little

1034
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:51,310
sub,
what,

1035
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:52,890
what do you call it?

1036
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:53,723
Substructures that are really in some 
sense at the core of the sub 

1037
00:52:58,021 --> 00:53:01,420
personalities that we talked about.
So for example,

1038
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:03,043
um,

1039
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:08,690
okay,
so this is,

1040
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,553
this is Swanson again and he's showing 
you this is a rat's brain from the 

1041
00:53:13,221 --> 00:53:16,850
bottom and he showing you the layout of 
the hypothalamus.

1042
00:53:16,851 --> 00:53:19,950
You see,
it's got all those different nuclei.

1043
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,190
It doesn't look like one thing.
It looks like a bunch of things.

1044
00:53:22,191 --> 00:53:23,024
And so here he says the descending 
paraventricular nucleus is involved in 

1045
00:53:29,191 --> 00:53:32,190
the control of eating and drinking.
And that's shown in green.

1046
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,910
So that's the thing that when you get 
hungry or thirsty,

1047
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:39,330
that's the thing that sort of turns on 
you're hungry and thirsty.

1048
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,173
Subpersonality and then the rest of the 
cell groups play a major role in 

1049
00:53:44,131 --> 00:53:44,964
controlling two classes of social 
behaviors that his behavior was 

1050
00:53:47,371 --> 00:53:48,204
involving interactions between animals 
rep productive as the rand areas and 

1051
00:53:52,651 --> 00:53:53,484
defensive the purplish areas.
So now what you can think is you have 

1052
00:53:57,991 --> 00:54:00,390
all those little sub routines that were 
talked about,

1053
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,373
you know,
that are sort of at hand and ready to 

1054
00:54:02,461 --> 00:54:03,120
go.

1055
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:03,953
And then they're organized underneath 
these major classes of motivation so 

1056
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:12,520
that you have to do something like eat.
And so they,

1057
00:54:12,521 --> 00:54:13,354
the,
it's like there's an eating robot in 

1058
00:54:14,521 --> 00:54:16,260
you.
That's one way of thinking about it,

1059
00:54:16,261 --> 00:54:19,260
except it's smarter than not.
And it's alive and conscious.

1060
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,730
You know,
these things are alive,

1061
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,920
they're not machines and they're not 
deterministic.

1062
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:25,350
They're just sub,
they're partial.

1063
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,393
You can pick up them as low resolution 
personalities or unit dimensional 

1064
00:54:29,611 --> 00:54:30,444
personalities.
Cause the only thing the eating system 

1065
00:54:31,711 --> 00:54:33,360
really cares about is whether or not you
eat.

1066
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,460
And the drinking system is the same 
thing.

1067
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:36,803
You know,
you see malfunctions sometimes when 

1068
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:39,444
people have these singular systems.
So you can develop a condition if you 

1069
00:54:42,181 --> 00:54:46,140
have hypothalamic damage where you,
you'll drink yourself,

1070
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:48,690
you'll drink water until you die and no 
one can stop you.

1071
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:49,883
You know,
they could lock you in a room away from 

1072
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:52,410
sinks and that would stop you.

1073
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:53,543
But you'd be raging away inside trying 
to claw through the door to get to the 

1074
00:54:56,071 --> 00:54:56,904
damn water because you're so hyper 
thirsty that if it's all that there is 

1075
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,530
left of you in some sense that if you're
allowed access to a tab,

1076
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:05,483
you'll just drink and drink and drink 
and drink and drink and drink and drink 

1077
00:55:07,181 --> 00:55:09,360
until you drown.
And you know,

1078
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,680
people can say,
Hey,

1079
00:55:10,681 --> 00:55:11,514
you've had enough water.
It's like forget that the hypothalamus 

1080
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:18,210
is a major league system and when push 
comes to shove,

1081
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,133
it's the thing that's in control.
And one of the ways of thinking about 

1082
00:55:22,051 --> 00:55:22,884
the way that you organize your,
your life is that the hypothalamus 

1083
00:55:26,851 --> 00:55:30,030
controls the major motivational systems 
we just talked about those.

1084
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:32,790
And so those are the things that people 
would think about as drives,

1085
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,670
although they're not drives,
they're too complicated to be drives.

1086
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:39,510
And then there's other systems that come
up later that we'll also talk about that

1087
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:43,490
or eat that govern emotion like anxiety 
and uh,

1088
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,600
and a different system that governs 
pain.

1089
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:49,980
Partly what you're trying to do as you 
organize your life is to make sure those

1090
00:55:49,981 --> 00:55:52,650
systems stay shut off.
And then you think,

1091
00:55:52,651 --> 00:55:53,610
well,
I'm in control.

1092
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,211
It's like,
well,

1093
00:55:54,211 --> 00:55:55,044
no,
you're not.

1094
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:59,550
You just satisfied all of the things 
that could take control from you.

1095
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,920
And so now you have a modicum of choice.
You can,

1096
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,860
and basically what you're doing,
we know of these things have had,

1097
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,650
what they need is you're running around 
and exploring,

1098
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:08,400
you know,
and that's,

1099
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,233
you know,
that's also another one of these 

1100
00:56:10,201 --> 00:56:12,600
circuits because the hypothalamus,
as I already said,

1101
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:13,830
governance,
exploration.

1102
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:19,180
So a lot of,
see,

1103
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:23,410
psychologists often get things backwards
and they ask silly questions.

1104
00:56:23,411 --> 00:56:24,760
Like,
why are people anxious?

1105
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,550
That's a stupid question.
It's how people,

1106
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:31,720
why are people ever calm?
That's a question because like,

1107
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,160
why are you anxious?
Well,

1108
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,470
hmm,
take up all the terrible things that can

1109
00:56:35,471 --> 00:56:38,230
happen to you and they will happen to 
you even worse.

1110
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,720
And there isn't anything you can do 
about it.

1111
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:40,573
It's like,
why aren't you quaking in your boots 

1112
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,710
just sitting there?
Well that's a mystery,

1113
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:46,030
you know,
and then,

1114
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:48,070
well,
you know,

1115
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:50,740
here you are in your normal state.
It's like,

1116
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,780
well no,
this is not a normal state.

1117
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,540
People have been trying for,

1118
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,160
okay,

1119
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:01,810
7 million years as people to create a 
situation.

1120
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:06,070
So complex and comfortable that a couple
of hundred of you can sit here,

1121
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:08,830
you know,
without having your hypothalamus driving

1122
00:57:08,831 --> 00:57:12,760
you towards something and actually just 
listen to something for a few hours,

1123
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:16,820
that's not normal.
That's so staggeringly abnormal that,

1124
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:18,010
that,
you know,

1125
00:57:18,011 --> 00:57:21,130
it's a miracle that the typical person 
like,

1126
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,340
and,
and for most of human history,

1127
00:57:24,341 --> 00:57:28,630
it's like you are hungry man.
And that's not the same like you people,

1128
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,550
but some of you have probably been 
hungry in your life.

1129
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:33,700
But I mean,
what's the longest standing?

1130
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:36,490
Is there someone here who's gone without
food for more than one day?

1131
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:38,623
Okay.
Has Anybody here gone without food for 

1132
00:57:39,771 --> 00:57:42,800
more than a week?
Okay.

1133
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,930
Okay.
How about three days?

1134
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:48,720
Okay.
So like are you hungry?

1135
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:49,973
No.
You know you're hungry when you haven't 

1136
00:57:51,421 --> 00:57:53,760
had anything deep for 20 days,
then you were hungry,

1137
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:54,953
you know,
so,

1138
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:56,843
and the same goes for thirst and cold 
and all the things that were just never 

1139
00:57:59,911 --> 00:58:00,790
exposed to.
So,

1140
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,940
you know,
we think p civilized people are all calm

1141
00:58:02,941 --> 00:58:04,560
and nice and easy to get along with.
It's like,

1142
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,640
yeah,
well you know,

1143
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,010
you have absolutely everything you need 
all the time.

1144
00:58:11,011 --> 00:58:11,844
So,
and that makes you as easy to get along 

1145
00:58:12,931 --> 00:58:15,840
with his,
any completely insane primate ever get.

1146
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:18,540
So,
okay,

1147
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:21,090
so the rent,
you might say,

1148
00:58:21,091 --> 00:58:21,924
well God,
if you can survive with just the 

1149
00:58:23,071 --> 00:58:25,290
hypothalamus,
what good is the rest of the brain?

1150
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:27,930
And the answer is,
well,

1151
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:32,710
if you're thirsty,

1152
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:35,200
oh,
let's say you're angry.

1153
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,240
The hunger system is going to be able to
take care of that,

1154
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:38,920
right?
So you're hungry,

1155
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:39,880
okay,
that works.

1156
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,710
You're angry,
that works.

1157
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:42,873
But then you have another problem,
which is you're hungry now when you're 

1158
00:58:45,341 --> 00:58:46,174
angry,
now perhaps you can move through those 

1159
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:50,890
states.
You watch that,

1160
00:58:50,891 --> 00:58:51,724
you'll see that in two year olds.
It's partly why they're so fun to be 

1161
00:58:53,501 --> 00:58:54,340
around.
It's like,

1162
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:56,020
first of all,
they're really excited.

1163
00:58:56,021 --> 00:58:57,730
They're running around playing and then 
you know,

1164
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,740
they trip and then they're crying like,
man.

1165
00:58:59,741 --> 00:59:00,574
And then you poke them and they laugh 
and then they want something to eat and 

1166
00:59:02,651 --> 00:59:05,140
then they fall asleep and you know,
you're just,

1167
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,153
you're just running.
They're run by their hypothalamus and 

1168
00:59:07,901 --> 00:59:08,734
it's really fun to see because they're 
so alive and so enthusiastic and 

1169
00:59:11,531 --> 00:59:14,080
spontaneous,
but they're completely clueless.

1170
00:59:14,081 --> 00:59:17,590
It's like you take one who throws his 
creatures to the mall and leave it there

1171
00:59:17,591 --> 00:59:19,600
and it's like,
it's just not happy at all.

1172
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,580
And the reason for that,
well,

1173
00:59:22,581 --> 00:59:24,650
it doesn't know how to sequence any of 
its actions,

1174
00:59:24,651 --> 00:59:25,201
right?
It it,

1175
00:59:25,201 --> 00:59:26,034
it runs through the states of need,
but it isn't complicated enough to 

1176
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:31,394
figure out how to address those needs in
any consistent sense across multiple 

1177
00:59:35,871 --> 00:59:37,940
environments.
In a social world,

1178
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:39,740
you need the rest of your brain for 
that.

1179
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:41,053
And so,
and that again fits in with the 

1180
00:59:42,171 --> 00:59:43,004
Piagetian idea is that what you're doing
is you're taking these micro 

1181
00:59:45,411 --> 00:59:49,970
personalities that are basically 
instantiated within the hypothalamus and

1182
00:59:49,971 --> 00:59:50,804
then you're organizing those into more 
and more complex games and you need the 

1183
00:59:54,051 --> 00:59:54,884
cortex to do that because the cortex is 
partly what enables you just to think 

1184
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:01,250
about time,
you know,

1185
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,233
because the hypothalamus is it,
so it's all right here and now thing 

1186
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:07,910
like the hypothalamic cat lives in the 
present,

1187
01:00:07,911 --> 01:00:10,400
there's thought present and that's it.
No,

1188
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,710
you probably get some sense of that.

1189
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:13,993
Like there are one of the things that 
happens to people if they take 

1190
01:00:16,251 --> 01:00:18,440
amphetamines or if they take psychedelic
drugs,

1191
01:00:18,441 --> 01:00:23,441
is that some of the inhibitory control.
Some of them are complex control systems

1192
01:00:24,411 --> 01:00:25,244
that are critical shut down.
And so then they enter a state where 

1193
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:34,040
it's all now and you know the now just 
comes at people in that state.

1194
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:35,780
It's,
it's a transcendent experience.

1195
01:00:35,781 --> 01:00:37,160
But of course,
you know,

1196
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:38,503
despite that you've not functional.
And so in some sense you trade that 

1197
01:00:42,021 --> 01:00:45,650
transcended relationship with reality 
for a narrow functionality.

1198
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,560
And that's too bad didn't,
that's life.

1199
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:49,400
But you know,
it's,

1200
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:50,293
it's,
it's a,

1201
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,100
it's a tradeoff.
So anyways,

1202
01:00:52,101 --> 01:00:52,934
you're organizing these sub 
personalities and you're using your 

1203
01:00:55,731 --> 01:00:56,564
cortex to do that because you know,
you don't just have to think about 

1204
01:00:58,911 --> 01:00:59,960
eating.
You have to think about,

1205
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:03,020
huh,
how am I going to get the food?

1206
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:05,990
When is the food going to come?
How am I going to cook the food?

1207
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:07,820
What about all the other people don't 
want to eat?

1208
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:09,013
How do we regulate that in our family?
And then how do we regulate that with 

1209
01:01:11,871 --> 01:01:14,780
the fact that we also need to sleep and 
we need to work and we need to get along

1210
01:01:14,781 --> 01:01:17,270
with other people and we need to have 
something interesting to do.

1211
01:01:17,271 --> 01:01:21,530
And like it's ridiculously complicated 
and it really doesn't,

1212
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,260
there's no end to the complication 
because

1213
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:26,993
you know,
maybe you're just solving the problem 

1214
01:01:27,991 --> 01:01:32,190
for you and then you're two or maybe 
you're trying to work it out within your

1215
01:01:32,191 --> 01:01:33,024
family.
Well they have not sort of like the 

1216
01:01:34,201 --> 01:01:35,034
crumb brothers,
they never get out of their family 

1217
01:01:36,061 --> 01:01:36,894
because they just never come to an 
arrangement that works well enough so 

1218
01:01:39,511 --> 01:01:40,311
that they can,
you know,

1219
01:01:40,311 --> 01:01:42,210
in some sense move into the broader 
world.

1220
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:43,463
Then you solve the family problem with,
then you've got the like the tribe 

1221
01:01:45,631 --> 01:01:48,810
problem and you know,
maybe you can solve that to some degree,

1222
01:01:48,811 --> 01:01:50,790
but then you have the broader political 
problem.

1223
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:51,624
It's like you don't,
there's an infinite number of problems 

1224
01:01:54,331 --> 01:01:55,164
that crop up for you to solve.
So there's plenty for you to do with 

1225
01:01:57,301 --> 01:01:59,060
your big Cortex,
you know?

1226
01:01:59,061 --> 01:02:02,280
And we've paid a big price for that 
thing because once we discovered time,

1227
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:05,143
no,

1228
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,633
we could make a bargain with the future,
which is basically what you do when you 

1229
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:13,190
regulate your behavior.
You're making a bargain with the future.

1230
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:17,960
You say to yourself,
if I forego so and so now,

1231
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:21,090
then later,
oh it'll pay off.

1232
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:24,630
And that's real useful.
You can conceptualize the future and you

1233
01:02:24,631 --> 01:02:27,390
can conceptualize the future as 
something you can bargain with.

1234
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,110
But there's a lot of cost to that.
One is you can't,

1235
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,070
you don't get to do just what you want 
right now.

1236
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:35,190
Of course that socks,
it's partly why people drink alcohol,

1237
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,820
you know,
because alcohol's disinhibiting it stops

1238
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:41,940
you from thinking it's the actually 
doesn't stop you from thinking about the

1239
01:02:41,941 --> 01:02:42,870
future.
By the way.

1240
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:43,943
It stops you from caring about what you 
think about the future and that's just 

1241
01:02:48,091 --> 01:02:48,924
as good.
And so then you could go out and have 

1242
01:02:49,861 --> 01:02:51,380
fun because fun is,
you know,

1243
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:55,470
impulsive and often extremely dangerous 
because the longterm consequences,

1244
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:57,450
you know,
it can be really devastating,

1245
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:01,020
but it's a real pain to keep yourself 
controlled all the time,

1246
01:03:01,021 --> 01:03:01,854
you know,
cause you're for going direct reward 

1247
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:06,480
constantly.

1248
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:07,783
You know,
I think it's part of the reason why 

1249
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:13,290
people in heavily industrialized complex
countries aren't necessarily happy.

1250
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:14,753
It's like,
you know,

1251
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:16,373
takes a lot of grinding away to keep all
the machinery that keeps all of this in 

1252
01:03:19,981 --> 01:03:21,390
place going,
you know,

1253
01:03:21,391 --> 01:03:23,250
so you're not getting typhoid,
didn't,

1254
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,380
you know,
tigers aren't tearing you apart,

1255
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:26,214
but by the same token,
you have to be unbelievably disciplined 

1256
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,473
and ready to act constantly to keep 
everything that's so complex around you 

1257
01:03:34,321 --> 01:03:36,570
working.
And that's not necessarily fun.

1258
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:39,510
So,
okay,

1259
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:44,720
now let's look at something else.
Now you can tell me if I,

1260
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,640
if I showed you this,
I hope I didn't show you this.

1261
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:04,020
You see that?
Okay,

1262
01:04:04,021 --> 01:04:04,854
good.
Now some of you know this and so you 

1263
01:04:06,781 --> 01:04:07,614
just don't say anything,
although you probably don't know this 

1264
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:13,440
specific version.
So you're going to,

1265
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,880
if you've seen this sort of thing 
before,

1266
01:04:14,881 --> 01:04:16,680
you're going to think you're smart while
you're watching it,

1267
01:04:16,681 --> 01:04:21,510
but it'll probably still trip you off.
I hope so.

1268
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:22,583
Give me a sec here and all.
See if we can actually get some sound 

1269
01:04:31,381 --> 01:04:32,214
out of this thing here.

1270
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:40,200
The monkey business
count how many times the players wearing

1271
01:04:40,871 --> 01:04:41,980
white pass the ball?

1272
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,290
The correct answer is 16.

1273
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:20,733
Did you spot the gorilla
for people who haven't seen or heard 

1274
01:05:25,331 --> 01:05:28,780
about a video like this before?
About half miss the gorilla.

1275
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:34,410
If you knew about the gorilla,
you probably saw it,

1276
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:35,633
but did you notice the curtain changing 
color or the player on the black team 

1277
01:05:38,281 --> 01:05:39,114
leaving the game?

1278
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:49,203
You're comes the gorilla and there goes 
a player and the curtain is changing 

1279
01:05:53,201 --> 01:05:54,070
from red to gold.

1280
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:05,320
What you're looking for a gorilla.
And that's the monkey.

1281
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:13,240
Learn more about this illusion and the 
original gorilla experiment.

1282
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,250
The invisible gorilla.com.

1283
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,260
Yeah,
so that's quite,

1284
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:26,400
that's quite the illustration.
So

1285
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:31,530
one of the questions you might ask is,
well,

1286
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:32,251
okay,
first of all,

1287
01:06:32,251 --> 01:06:35,970
how many of you didn't see the gorilla?
Okay.

1288
01:06:35,971 --> 01:06:38,310
How many of you have seen this sort of 
video before?

1289
01:06:38,430 --> 01:06:39,263
Okay,
so you knew about the damn brill of the 

1290
01:06:40,411 --> 01:06:42,720
people who didn't know about the 
gorilla.

1291
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:46,550
How many people didn't see the gorilla?
Well,

1292
01:06:46,551 --> 01:06:47,260
some.
Okay,

1293
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:49,170
fine.
How many of you got the other things?

1294
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:53,040
Both of them.
Okay.

1295
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:54,540
Wow.
So you get the point.

1296
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:55,890
The point is,
and it's brilliant,

1297
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:59,350
it's an insanely brilliant experiment.
Um,

1298
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:01,973
you're blind to a ridiculous degree and 
your visual system and your brain are 

1299
01:07:08,371 --> 01:07:10,530
constantly coping with the fact that 
you're blind,

1300
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:11,543
you know,
and,

1301
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:13,530
and you can kind of detect it to some 
degree.

1302
01:07:13,531 --> 01:07:16,710
Like if you look at someone,
what you pay attention to,

1303
01:07:16,711 --> 01:07:19,380
the things that surround them,
you'll see that like,

1304
01:07:19,381 --> 01:07:23,640
so I'm looking at you,
I can't see your nose for sure.

1305
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,800
It's gone.
I can't even see your face.

1306
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:26,963
I can see your glasses.
I can't see any features in your face 

1307
01:07:30,301 --> 01:07:32,250
goal.
Can you smile?

1308
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:36,940
The one behind.
So,

1309
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:37,973
well one of the things I've noticed when
doing this is that like if you look 

1310
01:07:40,111 --> 01:07:41,760
here,
look at my finger,

1311
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:44,760
but pay attention to my face.
It's really hard.

1312
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:47,220
Cause normally when you pay attention,
you move your eyes to what you're paying

1313
01:07:47,221 --> 01:07:48,750
attention to.
Okay.

1314
01:07:48,751 --> 01:07:49,584
So here's what you might see.
The first thing you might see is that 

1315
01:07:51,871 --> 01:07:52,704
you can't see my notes.
The second thing you might see is that 

1316
01:07:56,071 --> 01:07:58,220
you can really see my eyes,
especially if they moved.

1317
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:04,670
God,
it's so weird.

1318
01:08:04,671 --> 01:08:06,150
It's like all of a sudden these eyes 
park.

1319
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:09,950
Yeah.
So I'll try this too.

1320
01:08:09,951 --> 01:08:10,850
Okay,
so look at my,

1321
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:15,910
my finger again.
So you can also see teeth.

1322
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:17,810
Well,
why?

1323
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:21,260
Well if you're looking here and there's 
something there with eyes and teeth,

1324
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:23,090
you should probably be able to see it.
Right?

1325
01:08:23,091 --> 01:08:26,570
And so what that basically means is 
you've got this tiny little phobia,

1326
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:28,550
which is right in the center of your 
retina.

1327
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:29,533
It's just densely packed with cells.
And then those cells transmit 

1328
01:08:33,181 --> 01:08:37,130
information along the optic nerve and 
they're just connected like mad to cells

1329
01:08:37,131 --> 01:08:40,460
in the visual cortex.
But you don't have that much room.

1330
01:08:40,461 --> 01:08:44,630
So you can't connect all of the cells in
your retina to 10,000 cells.

1331
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:47,930
Like at the first level of connection,
you'd have to have a brain in this big,

1332
01:08:47,931 --> 01:08:49,160
you know,
and you don't,

1333
01:08:49,161 --> 01:08:50,110
so you,
you,

1334
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:51,013
you get by and part of the way you get 
by as you're always moving your eyes 

1335
01:08:53,721 --> 01:08:54,440
around.

1336
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,420
And so it looks like you can see 
everything,

1337
01:08:56,530 --> 01:09:00,710
but you can't in fact out here,
like if I'm looking at you now,

1338
01:09:00,711 --> 01:09:01,544
I can tell him my hands were there.
Although if I didn't know they were 

1339
01:09:03,951 --> 01:09:05,510
hands,
I probably couldn't figure it out.

1340
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,210
They're there.
They're kind of blurry,

1341
01:09:08,211 --> 01:09:10,910
I would say.
And they're in black and white,

1342
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:13,130
but I can't tell that,
you know.

1343
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:16,130
So out here it's like who cares what 
color it is?

1344
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,113
So you just don't see the color,
but you don't know that you don't see 

1345
01:09:18,801 --> 01:09:19,634
the color.
And then of course I can have my hands 

1346
01:09:21,531 --> 01:09:22,364
here and then I put him here.
I can hardly see them and then they're 

1347
01:09:24,561 --> 01:09:26,300
gone.
There are so gone,

1348
01:09:26,301 --> 01:09:28,220
it's like they don't even exist.
It's not even,

1349
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:29,173
you know,
cause you'd think in some sense that 

1350
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:32,780
what was behind your head would be 
black.

1351
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:36,050
Like when you close your eyes,
that's nothing.

1352
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:36,913
But no,
no.

1353
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:40,580
What you can't see behind your head is 
so not there that it isn't,

1354
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:42,530
you know,
it's literally,

1355
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:46,820
it isn't even not there.
That's all gone.

1356
01:09:46,821 --> 01:09:48,230
It is.
So,

1357
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:49,753
okay.
So part of the way that your eyes work 

1358
01:09:50,901 --> 01:09:55,901
is that the periphery is attached to 
devices in some sense.

1359
01:09:57,171 --> 01:09:59,930
And some of them detect lines and some 
of them detect movement.

1360
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:01,003
You remember Jurassic Park don't move.
The dinosaur can't see you unless you 

1361
01:10:04,881 --> 01:10:05,750
move.
It's like,

1362
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:06,793
yeah,
frogs are like that and catch her like 

1363
01:10:09,081 --> 01:10:09,914
that to some degree.
They can really see things move this 

1364
01:10:11,751 --> 01:10:13,980
way.
Partly because their eyes are slid.

1365
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:17,090
It makes it easier for them to see 
things moving like this.

1366
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:19,130
They're not so good at things moving 
like this.

1367
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:22,310
Well it's because they chase mice right 
in my smooth most mice,

1368
01:10:22,660 --> 01:10:24,080
you know,
except for like ones that haul,

1369
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:25,903
they moved this way.

1370
01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:26,943
And so cats are specialized for that.
And so you're also specialized to see 

1371
01:10:30,411 --> 01:10:31,244
teeth and eyes because you want to know 
if something's looking at you and you 

1372
01:10:35,091 --> 01:10:35,924
want to know if it has teeth.
And so what that means in part is that 

1373
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:40,333
the surrounding tissue in your eyes 
reports to some degree to your visual 

1374
01:10:44,301 --> 01:10:45,134
Cortex,
which is what you use to actually have 

1375
01:10:47,031 --> 01:10:47,864
conscious vision with.
But a lot of it just dumps down into 

1376
01:10:50,061 --> 01:10:50,894
the,
some of the brain areas we haven't 

1377
01:10:51,591 --> 01:10:52,424
talked about,
not necessarily directly down to the 

1378
01:10:54,561 --> 01:10:57,380
hypothalamus.
So though I suspect it has inputs there,

1379
01:10:57,710 --> 01:10:58,543
I just don't know.
But your eyes talk to your spinal cord 

1380
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:04,700
directly so that you could see something
snake light.

1381
01:11:04,701 --> 01:11:07,040
For example in jump,
just like you're,

1382
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:09,170
you jump.
If your hand touches a hot stove,

1383
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:11,590
you don't even see the snake.
It's like snake jump.

1384
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:14,700
And the reason for that is you waiting 
around to see the snake.

1385
01:11:14,701 --> 01:11:16,710
It's like it's bitten you 15 times and 
your dead.

1386
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:21,770
So you can't wait around and see this,
oh look a snake and you jump.

1387
01:11:22,141 --> 01:11:22,974
It's like,
no,

1388
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:25,570
that doesn't work.
So you're,

1389
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:30,180
your body has conserved all these layers
of reflex and movement all the way up to

1390
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,740
you know,
higher order,

1391
01:11:31,741 --> 01:11:32,574
voluntary movement because otherwise you
just wouldn't be fast enough when 

1392
01:11:35,011 --> 01:11:39,300
something super fast happens and then 
the way your eyes are built so your eyes

1393
01:11:39,301 --> 01:11:42,540
can tell your,
your body to jump if no vision,

1394
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:43,710
right?
It's just pattern,

1395
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:47,040
snake pattern jump pattern,
snake pattern,

1396
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:48,960
retinal pattern,
optic nerve pattern,

1397
01:11:48,961 --> 01:11:50,700
brain pattern,
muscle pattern,

1398
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:51,803
no vision,
no seeing cause you don't need to see 

1399
01:11:54,211 --> 01:11:55,044
it.
You just have to do pattern and pattern 

1400
01:11:55,861 --> 01:11:57,060
matching.
Right.

1401
01:11:57,061 --> 01:11:57,894
It's a weird way of thinking about it,
but it's not much different than the 

1402
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:00,990
touching.

1403
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:02,940
You know,
you can feel the pattern,

1404
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:06,480
you can build a three dimensional 
representation of it.

1405
01:12:06,481 --> 01:12:07,314
You can really see well with your eyes.
Just like the idea of that blind people 

1406
01:12:09,361 --> 01:12:10,194
can't see as a really dopey idea.
It can't see color and they're not very 

1407
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:15,090
good at detecting things in the 
distance,

1408
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:18,360
but they have a visual world.
It's just built out of things that don't

1409
01:12:18,361 --> 01:12:19,650
have color.
You know,

1410
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,353
you,
you know perfectly well that that's the 

1411
01:12:22,231 --> 01:12:23,970
case.
Cause I could hand you an object and you

1412
01:12:23,971 --> 01:12:25,740
could fiddle around with it behind your 
back.

1413
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,830
And after some fiddling around,
you know exactly what it looked like.

1414
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:31,440
And you know,
you might pull it out here and say,

1415
01:12:31,441 --> 01:12:33,330
well I didn't know it was blue.
It's like,

1416
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,230
yeah,
okay,

1417
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:36,090
fair enough.
He didn't know it was blue but you still

1418
01:12:36,091 --> 01:12:39,990
saw it and you can get pretty God damn 
good vision with your ears.

1419
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:43,260
So there are kids who are blind who've 
learned to echolocate.

1420
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:45,060
So they go click,
click,

1421
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,740
click.
They don't make that noise.

1422
01:12:46,741 --> 01:12:47,574
Exactly.
But they do click and they can detect 

1423
01:12:50,251 --> 01:12:53,040
the clicks bouncing off of things.
And they can do that well enough,

1424
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:53,903
not only to walk,
but some of them can actually ride 

1425
01:12:55,111 --> 01:12:56,520
bikes.
It's like,

1426
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:58,430
hey,
that's impressive math.

1427
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:00,600
So,
so what's that?

1428
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:02,490
Yeah,
there's one kid,

1429
01:13:02,491 --> 01:13:05,310
I saw a kid on youtube who was blind who
could shoot baskets.

1430
01:13:05,311 --> 01:13:06,110
Yeah.
Which is fine.

1431
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:07,410
Hey God,
that's impressive.

1432
01:13:07,411 --> 01:13:08,690
Now,
but you know,

1433
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:09,930
my point is,
is that,

1434
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,120
you know,
a lot of the neural tissue is,

1435
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:15,690
it'll take whatever input it gets.
And so if you're born blind,

1436
01:13:15,870 --> 01:13:16,703
you're,
your auditory systems will invade your 

1437
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:22,890
visual system and then you have twice as
much brain devoted to your hearing.

1438
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,390
So,
and then you know,

1439
01:13:24,391 --> 01:13:26,130
you can use that quite effectively.

1440
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:27,570
So,
all right.

1441
01:13:27,571 --> 01:13:30,060
So I think we're probably pretty much 
all the time.

1442
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:31,223
The one thing I want to tell you before 
we go on to the next part though is 

1443
01:13:33,271 --> 01:13:34,104
that,
so now we've sort of built up the idea 

1444
01:13:36,571 --> 01:13:37,404
of these underlying motivational systems
and now you can kind of see how they 

1445
01:13:41,221 --> 01:13:43,380
work.
So you might say to yourself,

1446
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:48,860
why didn't you see the gorilla?
And the curtain and the person leaving.

1447
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:52,440
It's really complicated.
It's really complicated.

1448
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:57,810
Well,
the first answer is you did what I asked

1449
01:13:58,890 --> 01:13:59,760
and then you might ask,
well,

1450
01:13:59,761 --> 01:14:01,860
why?
Why did you do what I asked?

1451
01:14:01,861 --> 01:14:03,240
I mean,
you miss the damn gorilla,

1452
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:04,103
right?
It's like,

1453
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:06,060
obviously that wasn't a very good 
decision.

1454
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:07,141
So you think,
well,

1455
01:14:07,141 --> 01:14:10,200
why did you do what I asked?
And the answer would be,

1456
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:12,003
well,
it's sort of like the milgram obedience 

1457
01:14:13,421 --> 01:14:14,700
experiment,
except you know,

1458
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:16,480
why don't we leverage lower level?

1459
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:19,000
It's like we've got an agreement going 
on here.

1460
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:22,690
You guys are all very sophisticated and 
complex game players.

1461
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:23,913
You know,
otherwise you couldn't sit here 

1462
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:27,790
peacefully for an hour and a half.
So you're,

1463
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:29,950
you're very well socialized,
all of you.

1464
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,053
And so that means that you've organized 
all your motivations into a hierarchy 

1465
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:35,343
and it's,
and that hierarchy is guiding your 

1466
01:14:37,061 --> 01:14:38,680
behavior here.
It might be something like,

1467
01:14:38,681 --> 01:14:39,910
well,
we need to learn something.

1468
01:14:39,911 --> 01:14:40,744
And hypothetically you've come here and 
you learn something and so you're 

1469
01:14:43,361 --> 01:14:47,260
playing that out.
And then because that's the motivational

1470
01:14:47,261 --> 01:14:50,910
state that you're in.
When I asked you to do something,

1471
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:52,570
you're just going to do it.
Well.

1472
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:53,433
Then what's so cool is that as soon as 
you decide to point your attention out 

1473
01:14:57,881 --> 01:14:58,714
something,
what happens is what you see in the 

1474
01:15:01,331 --> 01:15:03,580
world radically transforms.
You know?

1475
01:15:03,581 --> 01:15:05,020
So I say,
well,

1476
01:15:05,021 --> 01:15:05,854
count the basketballs and all of a 
sudden all you can see or basketballs 

1477
01:15:08,051 --> 01:15:08,651
and you think,
no,

1478
01:15:08,651 --> 01:15:10,150
no,
I see I'm not blind.

1479
01:15:10,150 --> 01:15:11,110
It's like,
wow,

1480
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,273
you're pretty damn blind.
And so that's partly how you can 

1481
01:15:16,751 --> 01:15:19,300
understand how motivation is a 
subpersonality.

1482
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:22,420
Like it has its whole sets of 
perceptions and values.

1483
01:15:22,421 --> 01:15:26,200
It's like all of a sudden I said,
you open a little motivated state.

1484
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:27,730
It was a complicated one,
you know,

1485
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:30,070
but it was just like,
here's the task.

1486
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:31,143
And so you're all motivated.
You're going to do the task properly 

1487
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,860
for,
for God only knows how many reasons.

1488
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,920
And then all of a sudden all that exists
in the world are basketballs.

1489
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:41,920
Right?
And so that,

1490
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:43,170
that's,
that's it's,

1491
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,370
it's,
it's as if you're,

1492
01:15:44,371 --> 01:15:45,204
your goal directed attention has 
transformed the phenomenology of the 

1493
01:15:48,191 --> 01:15:49,024
world.
And that's something that's really cool 

1494
01:15:50,291 --> 01:15:52,210
because one of the things that implies 
is that

1495
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:56,080
what you see of the world depends on 
what you're aiming at.

1496
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:59,860
And in a real sense that this isn't some
trivial sense.

1497
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:02,650
It means like literally what you're 
aiming at,

1498
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:05,020
I'm going to count the basketballs.
It means,

1499
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,150
well,
you're not noticing the gorillas.

1500
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:10,270
So one of the things that you might ask 
yourself in this apartment,

1501
01:16:10,271 --> 01:16:15,271
what the phenomenologists were on about 
is what he Ayman had and what is it that

1502
01:16:16,871 --> 01:16:17,704
what you're aiming at allows you to see 
and what is it that what you're aiming 

1503
01:16:20,801 --> 01:16:21,634
at blinds you to?
And it blinds you to a lot more than it 

1504
01:16:24,671 --> 01:16:25,504
allows you to see.
And so another thing that you can think 

1505
01:16:27,551 --> 01:16:28,384
about is like if everything you see 
makes you angry and bitter and 

1506
01:16:30,251 --> 01:16:33,460
resentful,
then you might think,

1507
01:16:33,461 --> 01:16:36,430
well,
what exactly am I aiming at?

1508
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:39,820
This making the world organizes itself 
around me in that manner.

1509
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:41,200
And that's,
you know,

1510
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:42,183
that's very,
that would be a complex from a union 

1511
01:16:44,201 --> 01:16:46,630
perspective,
a complex would do that.

1512
01:16:46,631 --> 01:16:47,800
So it's a set of values.

1513
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,930
They're sort of economist,
they inhabit you.

1514
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,300
It's a sub personality.
It's quite complex.

1515
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:55,090
It's got something.
It's saving that you might not know even

1516
01:16:55,091 --> 01:16:55,924
what that is because you're acting it 
out instead of understanding it and 

1517
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,153
because you're inside of it,
it lays the world out for you in a 

1518
01:17:03,221 --> 01:17:04,054
particular way and it makes you,
it makes the world looked like it's 

1519
01:17:06,161 --> 01:17:07,900
showing you that what you think is 
right.

1520
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,940
But it's just,
you know,

1521
01:17:10,941 --> 01:17:11,774
if you're,
what did they say to the man with a 

1522
01:17:12,591 --> 01:17:14,090
hammer?
Everything looks like a nail.

1523
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:15,800
Right?
And that's,

1524
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:16,693
that's,
that's one of the things that's so damn 

1525
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:19,610
cool about that experiment.
It's like,

1526
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:22,100
really?
I'm really that blind.

1527
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:27,220
I could miss something that radical just
when I'm involved in some dopey task,

1528
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:29,630
like counting basketballs,
it makes me so blind to that.

1529
01:17:29,631 --> 01:17:32,360
It's almost beyond comprehension.
Well,

1530
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,460
so in some ways you,
you know,

1531
01:17:34,461 --> 01:17:37,310
you skipped between different states of 
blindness,

1532
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:39,170
lot of them are biologically motivated.

1533
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:40,963
Then you turn those into a hierarchy and
that sort of your higher value system 

1534
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:44,293
and then that thing points you at 
something and the whole world lays 

1535
01:17:46,701 --> 01:17:47,534
itself out around that.
And the way it does is it divides the 

1536
01:17:49,941 --> 01:17:50,774
world and do irrelevant things.
And so those would've been the curtains 

1537
01:17:53,691 --> 01:17:54,524
in this particular example or the 
gorilla or even a player in black lift 

1538
01:17:57,651 --> 01:18:01,040
the game irrelevant because it didn't 
interfere with you counting.

1539
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:04,190
So what you look at makes most of the 
world irrelevant.

1540
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:08,600
It makes some things,
things that serve you and that makes you

1541
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:10,970
feel positive emotion and it makes other
things,

1542
01:18:10,971 --> 01:18:14,060
things that get in your way and that's 
what makes negative emotion.

1543
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:15,403
And so you've got the hypothalamic 
system that point you in biological 

1544
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:22,220
directions,
you organize those and then it's like as

1545
01:18:22,221 --> 01:18:23,054
you were approaching the thing,
you're aiming at the positive emotion 

1546
01:18:25,821 --> 01:18:26,654
systems tell you when you're on track 
and the negative emotion systems tell 

1547
01:18:29,181 --> 01:18:30,410
you when something's interfering.

1548
01:18:30,650 --> 01:18:33,680
And those are actually different 
neurological systems.

1549
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:34,993
So they're not in the hypothalamus.
The positive emotion system is to some 

1550
01:18:37,791 --> 01:18:39,980
degree,
but the negative emotion system,

1551
01:18:39,981 --> 01:18:42,410
not that evolved later.
And there's a couple of them.

1552
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:45,200
There's one that produces pain,
we'll talk about it more.

1553
01:18:45,201 --> 01:18:49,220
And there's another one that produces 
anxiety and so awesome.

1554
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,113
Now you kind of understand the relation,
roughly the relationship between 

1555
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:55,400
motivation,
perception,

1556
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,550
and emotion.
No,

1557
01:18:57,590 --> 01:18:58,423
they all act together and they're all 
dependent in this weird way in on what 

1558
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:03,704
you're after,
so that you can think about that for 50 

1559
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:07,820
years and you won't get to the bottom of
it.

1560
01:19:07,821 --> 01:19:08,654
You know,
the Buddhists say that everything is 

1561
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:10,460
illusion,
Maya.

1562
01:19:10,461 --> 01:19:11,720
Right?
People live in illusion.

1563
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:14,930
Why is what you're aiming at determines 
what you see.

1564
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:19,440
So anyways,
it's worth it.
