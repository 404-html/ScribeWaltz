1
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,060
Hello.
So a couple of you who are out there,

2
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:54,660
maybe you can just send me a quick text 
and tell me if this is working.

3
00:00:58,930 --> 00:00:59,741
Yes.
Excellent.

4
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:00,574
Can you hear me

5
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,030
Mad Matt?
I work at Mars in Toronto.

6
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:10,280
Can you share your thoughts and why it 
hasn't worked?

7
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,620
Wow,
that's a complicated question.

8
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:15,020
Let's get to that a little bit later.
You guys can hear me.

9
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,430
Excellent.
Let's go.

10
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,623
So this is what I'm going to do.
I want to talk to you first about 

11
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,530
Patriarchy and then I'm going to take 
some questions that people have said.

12
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:25,364
I've got this new thing called a pigeon 
hole and that's enabled people to vote 

13
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:35,330
up questions and then I'm also going to 
take some of the questions that are on,

14
00:01:35,331 --> 00:01:36,220
um,
you know,

15
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,950
that are streaming in so,
so hopefully that'll all work.

16
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,070
See if I'm in focus.
Not too bad.

17
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,300
All right,
there we go.

18
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:48,134
Consider the overwhelming success of the
Patriot and counted the money raised by 

19
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:51,584
rebel.
What will you be doing with their 

20
00:01:52,191 --> 00:01:54,920
contributions?
Well that's great.

21
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,973
All right,
so I've got a couple of things to say 

22
00:01:56,781 --> 00:01:57,614
about that.

23
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,190
So the first one is,
you know,

24
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,030
I would say a number of people have been
attempt and not an overwhelming number,

25
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:05,864
but a number of people have been 
attempting to take me to task for the 

26
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:12,770
fact that my patriotic support has been,
let's call it overwhelmingly successful.

27
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,063
And,
and so I'll tell you how I formulate my 

28
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:18,224
response to that.
The first is I'm generating almost all 

29
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:26,270
of my content and making it completely 
publicly accessible so it's free,

30
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:26,990
right?
And,

31
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,823
and so that way I'm bringing I think,
awareness of psychological issues to a 

32
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:35,720
very large number of people.
And so far at the moment,

33
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,700
my view count on Youtube is up to 13 
million and I've did,

34
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,980
did a little bit of calculations last 
week to try to figure out what the total

35
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:44,960
view count was,
um,

36
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,603
for,
for the cuts of my lectures that have 

37
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:51,800
been appearing on youtube and then the 
political material as well.

38
00:02:51,801 --> 00:02:52,634
And I think it's upward of 50 million.
And so I'm making psychological and 

39
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:58,520
political content available to 50 
million people.

40
00:02:58,521 --> 00:02:59,710
And so,
you know,

41
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,100
that

42
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,040
seems like a reasonable thing to do.
Now,

43
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,320
people who don't agree with what I'm 
saying might differ,

44
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:09,130
but I think that could be separated from
the educational content as well.

45
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,533
So,
and then with regards to the Patriot on 

46
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,203
subscribers,
every single person who's doing that is 

47
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:15,904
doing it entirely voluntarily.
And I also set up that Patriot on 

48
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,250
account long before any of this 
political material emerged.

49
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,760
So my sense with the patron viewers,
and you guys can clue me in if I'm wrong

50
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,324
about this,
is that there's two things happening is 

51
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:30,904
one is it enables people who are not 
very happy about the current political 

52
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,370
situation in the west to,
to,

53
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,520
to uh,
contribute to something that might be at

54
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:42,994
least to some degree attempting to stem 
the tide of such things as toxic 

55
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:47,194
political correctness.
And second that it enables people to 

56
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:51,454
support my endeavors,
to bring general education to a wider 

57
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:55,744
audience.
And that seems like a good deal for 

58
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:58,150
everyone.
And you know,

59
00:03:58,151 --> 00:03:58,811
you might say,
well,

60
00:03:58,811 --> 00:03:59,644
it's a particularly good deal for me and
I'm certainly not complaining about 

61
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:04,570
what's happening,
but I would also point out that,

62
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,753
um,
it hasn't exactly been a straight 

63
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:10,030
forward thing.
And so,

64
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,193
um,

65
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,930
so I guess if anyone else wants to try 
it,

66
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:19,450
they're more than welcome to.
Now having said that,

67
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,063
um,
I would also say that the real issue 

68
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:24,424
here,
and I think this is the fact that this 

69
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:27,034
isn't self evident is also a commentary 
on the toxicity of our culture at the 

70
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:32,770
moment,
is that it actually isn't the issue.

71
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,170
The issue isn't really how much money 
you have.

72
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,413
I think that that's a resentful and at 
relatively vicious way of judging 

73
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:41,674
someone else.
I think the issue is what you do with 

74
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:46,180
the money when you have it.
And you know,

75
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,840
um,
I'm not a particularly hedonistic person

76
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,760
and I'm not 25 years old,
you know,

77
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:55,750
I'm 55 years old and I'm going to be a 
grandfather in a couple of months,

78
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:57,040
you know,
thank God for that.

79
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,880
Um,
and what I want to do with that money is

80
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,580
to do the best things I can possibly 
think of to do with it.

81
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:05,230
And one of the things I'm thinking 
about,

82
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:07,480
I started this biblical series and a lot
of that's help,

83
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,433
thankful thanks to you guys on Patrion 
because that enabled me to generate the 

84
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:15,670
capital that was necessary to rent the 
theater because for 12 lectures,

85
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:18,250
that was a $60,000 investment about 
that,

86
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,100
something like that.
And then another $8,000 for the,

87
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,150
for the camera work.

88
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,960
And that had to be basically,
uh,

89
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,360
dealt with upfront.
So it was a reasonable financial risks.

90
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,223
Now I've been s crazily fortunate in 
that the theater tickets have also sold 

91
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:35,074
out.
So it looks like the biblical series 

92
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:38,410
will pay for itself with some extra 
leftover.

93
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:39,131
And so,
you know,

94
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm pretty happy about that because that
gives me some more working capital.

95
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:44,260
And then you might say,
well,

96
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,570
what am I going to do with the capital?
Well,

97
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,290
I'm going to continue doing the sorts of
things that I'm already doing.

98
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,130
I want to do a series on the hundred 
greatest books of the western Canon,

99
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:54,964
for example.
I want to move genuine humanities 

100
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,650
education out of the universities where 
it isn't being taught anyways.

101
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:04,160
As far as I can tell online where people
can access it freely.

102
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,503
I'm talking to a wide variety of people 
right now about trying to do that in a 

103
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:09,614
more formal sense so that the 
possibility for widespread university 

104
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,500
education can be universally accessible.

105
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,333
And one of the things we're trying to 
crack is the problem of how to teach 

106
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:21,170
people to write.
Cause that's a real troublesome thing.

107
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:22,340
And by the way,
you know,

108
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,940
you guys,
if you go onto my website,

109
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:28,640
Jordan peterson.com and you go into 
courses

110
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:35,210
and you go into psychology for 30 if you
look carefully there,

111
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:36,044
you'll see that there's an essay rubric 
that teeth that tells people how to 

112
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:39,194
write.
And actually that's become quite 

113
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:41,144
popular.
And so if you're interested in how to 

114
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:43,574
learn to write,
I've written something about that 

115
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:45,524
already and we're going to make a piece 
of software that's going to help people 

116
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:48,104
learn to write.
And so I've got plans for how to make 

117
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:54,320
writing education broadly accessible to 
people.

118
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:57,560
So I would like to make humanities 
education of the highest order,

119
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:58,394
broadly accessible to people.
And I also want to teach them how to 

120
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:00,980
write.

121
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,760
And I'm going to try to crack the online
university accreditation problem.

122
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,810
And so part of the money that,
or a substantial proportion of the money

123
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:11,840
that is being donated to me,
let's say,

124
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:15,410
or is being offered to me by my monthly 
supporters.

125
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:19,490
So that's all of you people is going to 
be going to projects exactly like that.

126
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,593
And the reason for that is,
is that what the hell else would I do 

127
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:24,350
with the money?
You know,

128
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,360
I mean,
to me money is a tool.

129
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,500
It's not,
it's not the means whereby you develop a

130
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:34,400
luxurious lifestyle and spend your time 
burning yourself,

131
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,290
have to death in the sun,
in the Caribbean,

132
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,450
snorting cocaine and chasing hookers.
You know,

133
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,940
it's just,
that's just not in the cards for me.

134
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,920
Um,
and uh,

135
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,083
and so I want to devote it towards the 
sorts of things that I've already been 

136
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:48,680
pursuing except on a broader scale.

137
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,610
And so you know,
and I think of people like Elon Musk to,

138
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,800
not that I'm comparing myself to Elon 
Musk,

139
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:57,470
but I mean he has plenty of money and I 
mean you really,

140
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,543
somebody's got to have the damn money.
It might as well be people who have the 

141
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:02,084
kind of vision that people like he does 
have because maybe they'll do something 

142
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:05,744
good for the world.
I mean I hope his gigafactories produce 

143
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:09,824
batteries like mad so that we can start 
to make alternative energy sources 

144
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:15,974
economically viable and maybe reduce our
dependence on oil and maybe get 

145
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:21,550
ourselves out from underneath the thumb 
of the Saudi Arabs.

146
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,160
That would be a good thing.
So the monetary issue,

147
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:26,390
it's,
it's quite interesting.

148
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:28,280
It's like it is not the,
you have the money,

149
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:30,250
it's what you do with it.
And so anyways,

150
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,123
those are some of my plants and that 
isn't all of them because I'm going to 

151
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:34,604
come up with a bunch more plans and I'm 
going to try to implement them as 

152
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:38,000
rapidly as I possibly can.

153
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,070
I've put my clinical practice on hiatus 
for the next three months so that I have

154
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:43,904
a chance to think,
and I've requested that the university 

155
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:47,054
advanced my sabbatical by one year.
So I should have about a year to think 

156
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:54,770
about what I should be doing with 
youtube and how I can be promoting broad

157
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,180
scale public education of the highest 
quality.

158
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,340
And that's a really fun problem to 
solve.

159
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,503
And the fact that I'm being supported by
all of you people on Patrion makes the 

160
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:04,314
probability that avail to that all be 
able to devote my time to that much 

161
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,170
higher.
So,

162
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,873
so that's what I'm going to do with it.
I'm going to do the best things I can 

163
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:16,380
possibly think of to do with it.
And uh,

164
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,130
hopefully that'll work.
And so far it seems to be going well.

165
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:21,510
So,
um,

166
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,753
yeah,
I mean I've been taken aback back quite 

167
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:26,370
a bit by the,
I mean,

168
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:27,840
it's not surprising that,
you know,

169
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,780
the people who've been trying to take me
down,

170
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,623
let's say are squawking and bitching 
because I happened to be generating a 

171
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:35,184
fairly reasonable income from this,
although I don't think about it as an 

172
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:38,880
income,
as I already said,

173
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:39,714
I think about it as a,
as a toolkit for pursuing more 

174
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,840
interesting things.
It's like if that's the best they can do

175
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:48,240
with regards to continuing to tarnish my
name,

176
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:50,970
well then let them,
let them go right ahead about that.

177
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:51,804
And uh,
I think the proof is in the outcome and 

178
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,183
the biblical series and that's a direct 
consequence of the Patriot and support 

179
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,900
that seems to be going like mad.
I think,

180
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,063
you know,
about 500,000 people have watched the 

181
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:06,090
videos so far with another,
who knows,

182
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:08,470
tens of thousands of people listening to
the podcasts.

183
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,303
And that's just a bloody miracle that,
that many people would be interested in 

184
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,223
what I consider the fundamental 
foundation for any true humanities 

185
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:18,750
education.
So great.

186
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,490
We'll build from there.
And so that's,

187
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,500
that's what I'm going to do with the 
money.

188
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,620
So,
and if people don't like that,

189
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:28,440
then they don't have to donate or they 
don't have to subscribe.

190
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:31,560
It's hardly like it's mandatory.
So anyways,

191
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,720
I'll stop with that and I'll get to 
another question or a question.

192
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,290
Another question.
Um,

193
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,483
here's one that got 264 votes so far,
is the belief in something more than 

194
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:48,150
experienced reality unreasonable.
Okay.

195
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:48,984
So I want to address that question 
technically to begin to begin with 

196
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,374
because one of the things that you want 
to do when someone asks you a question 

197
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:55,314
is that you want to take a look at the 
question because the question boxes you 

198
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:58,860
in in a certain way.

199
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,260
And if you're going to answer the 
question you make,

200
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,123
you have to make sure that you've 
properly processed the structure of the 

201
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:06,690
question.
So let's look at this one.

202
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,680
Is the belief in something more than 
experienced reality unreasonable.

203
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,830
And so then I'm going to go socratic on 
this and say,

204
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:14,664
well,
it depends on what you mean by belief 

205
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:17,903
experienced reality,
something more and unreasonable and and 

206
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,523
see the problem is you can't really 
answer a question like that unless you 

207
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:28,950
delve into the definitions.
So let's say,

208
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,370
well,
what do you mean by experienced reality?

209
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,300
Do you mean that which is directly 
grippable by the senses?

210
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,030
While then I would say,
well do you believe in numbers?

211
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,090
Because numbers aren't directly 
experienceable,

212
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:43,983
but obviously they're real.
If you define reality as the use of 

213
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,040
concepts that give you grip and power in
the world.

214
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:51,874
And I think because I'm a pragmatist in,
I mean part of the way that I define 

215
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:55,923
something as real is whether or not it 
has functional operative status in the 

216
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:02,830
world.
And so the belief in something more than

217
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:05,890
experienced reality is obviously clearly
reasonable.

218
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,760
If you regard abstractions as something 
more than experienced reality.

219
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,953
And that brings up another issue.
And the issue is whether or not 

220
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:15,640
instructions or even more real than 
experienced reality.

221
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:19,060
And I would say often they are because 
otherwise abstraction wouldn't work.

222
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,290
So it's definitely not unreasonable.
And then you,

223
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,183
do you mean merely subjectively 
experienced reality or do you mean the 

224
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,140
kind of reality that can be experienced 
by multiple people at the same time?

225
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,123
Because that's also different that the 
ladder is more in the domain of 

226
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:36,634
scientific inquiry.
And I think the problem with belief in 

227
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:41,374
subjectively experienced reality is not 
so much that what you experience 

228
00:12:44,511 --> 00:12:47,830
subjectively isn't real is that you can 
get the categories wrong.

229
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,960
You know,
dreams are real,

230
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:51,783
but they're not the same kind of real as
things in the outside world that other 

231
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:55,714
people can experience.
And to conflate the two or to failure 

232
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,560
fail to distinguish between them as a 
form of insanity.

233
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,720
But that doesn't mean that both of them 
aren't real.

234
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,760
So,
um,

235
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,653
so the simple answer to the question is 
the belief is the belief in something 

236
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:14,170
more than experienced reality.
Unreasonable is no,

237
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,333
but it depends on,
it depends on your specific definitions 

238
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,890
of all those terms and those sorts of 
things really matter.

239
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,090
Okay.
Bet.

240
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,003
Bob Asbury says,
I'm a 58 year old American redneck who 

241
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:28,240
never went to college a day in his life.

242
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,060
Okay.

243
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,060
But I feel like I'm getting a world 
class education every day.

244
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,350
Thank you,
Dr. Peterson.

245
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,480
You are very cool.
Well thank you.

246
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:38,610
I don't know how cool I am exactly,
but I am.

247
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,630
I tell you,
man,

248
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:44,750
and this is the dead truth.
I am absolutely thrilled that I have the

249
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:50,721
opportunity to provide educational 
resources to people all over the world.

250
00:13:50,761 --> 00:13:52,380
It's a dream,
you know,

251
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,610
really,
I mean,

252
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,563
it's an absolute privilege.
So when I get letters from people like 

253
00:13:57,361 --> 00:14:00,060
you very,
very frequently from all over the world,

254
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:00,894
you know,
one the fact that now we have the 

255
00:14:02,311 --> 00:14:03,144
technology to allow people in principle 
to have a world class university 

256
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:08,334
education is mind boggling.
And here's something I think is 

257
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:11,844
absolutely comical.
And I'd been pursuing this with a group 

258
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,290
of people that I've been discussing.
Um,

259
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,273
I've been having intense discussions 
with some in Silicon Valley and some in 

260
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:20,550
Montreal,
in some,

261
00:14:20,551 --> 00:14:21,990
in Toronto.
You know,

262
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,560
the f here's the university situation in
many ways.

263
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,173
Number one,
they're putting students in debt in a 

264
00:14:28,441 --> 00:14:33,090
tremendous way in the United States over
because of overpriced education.

265
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,740
They don't let the students,
um,

266
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,490
declared bankruptcy because of the 
doubt.

267
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,423
Okay.

268
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,390
And so it's basically indentured 
servitude.

269
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,493
And so then students come out of 
university and death it heavily at the 

270
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:49,204
time of their life when they should be 
relatively free of financial burdens so 

271
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:54,074
that they can be creative and 
entrepreneurial because you're going to 

272
00:14:56,871 --> 00:14:58,880
do that when you're young,
generally speaking,

273
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,290
then the universities have become 
administratively top heavy and,

274
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,124
and stultified because of that,
then they've abandoned their commitment 

275
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:09,050
to the humanities,
right?

276
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,913
Then they're not utilizing modern 
technology to extend the reach as 

277
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:15,200
broadly as they possibly could.
Then they've,

278
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,400
they've,
uh,

279
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,233
in some sense abandoned their 
responsibility to do a crediting 

280
00:15:19,731 --> 00:15:23,660
properly and devalued the value of the 
degree because they treat their students

281
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:25,090
like consumers and,
and,

282
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,640
and inflate the grade currency.
So to me,

283
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:29,474
that's a perfect storm of error.
And so I see an opportunity emerging 

284
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:33,344
right now where the intellectual 
property that's related to the true 

285
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:38,390
humanities and that would be at least in
part,

286
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:39,224
the western Cultural Canon could just be
taken out of the universities grip and 

287
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:45,620
provided to people in high quality form 
online.

288
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,053
And if I can crack,
how to teach people to write and then 

289
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:51,170
also to figure out the accreditation 
problem,

290
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:52,250
which I don't think is,
uh,

291
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,300
uh,
uh,

292
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,160
it's not an overwhelmingly complex 
problem.

293
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,043
It's complex,
but not overwhelmingly then there's no 

294
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:01,760
reason that the university can't moved 
to Kent Move Online.

295
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,433
And I would say the true university 
exists where people are pursuing 

296
00:16:06,141 --> 00:16:06,974
education because they bloody well want 
to get educated because they know that 

297
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:10,964
being sharp and articulate and 
historically informed and 

298
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:17,120
philosophically wise and all of that 
makes their lives better,

299
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,730
makes them better citizens,
makes them more responsible.

300
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,743
And so I want to follow the university 
where it goes and as far as I'm 

301
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:23,804
concerned,
the universities where people want to 

302
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:25,634
listen to wisdom and I'm going to try to
dispense wisdom to the degree that I'm 

303
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:31,610
fortunate enough to have access to it.
So,

304
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,780
um,
anyways,

305
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:33,614
Bob,
like I'm thrilled that I can be of 

306
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:38,060
service to you and um,
it's a real privilege and so,

307
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,590
and we're going to do more of that.

308
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,300
So.
All right.

309
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,640
So another question.
Am I feeling all right?

310
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,390
How is my health?
Well that's a good question.

311
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:48,980
Um,
I've had,

312
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,950
I've had a history of depression as some
of you may know it,

313
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,013
it's a plague in my family.
It goes back many generations and also 

314
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:58,850
has afflicted one of my children quite 
badly.

315
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,013
But we are figuring this out and I'm 
actually feeling pretty good right now 

316
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,350
for the first time in about seven or 
eight months.

317
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:09,590
I'm really looking forward to the future
again and I'm getting my energy back.

318
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:12,170
And when I have energy,
I have a lot of energy.

319
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,360
And uh,
so,

320
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,160
and because I put my clinical practice 
on hiatus and because I've applied for a

321
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:19,994
sabbatical and I'm going to have some 
time and because of this massive 

322
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:25,370
construction project that I've been 
engaged in in my house,

323
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:28,550
cause I put a,
basically a native American longhouse on

324
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:30,440
the ceiling of my house,
believe it or not,

325
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,190
maybe one day.

326
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,140
I'll walk you through that if you'd be 
interested.

327
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,453
Um,
I'm going to have a lot of time and I'm 

328
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:38,360
finishing a book and it's due on June 
5th.

329
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,410
It's called 12 rules for life and 
antidote for chaos.

330
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,860
And that's just about done.
And it'll be out January 9th,

331
00:17:45,861 --> 00:17:48,170
I think,
2018 then,

332
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:49,500
uh,
you know,

333
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,360
that's going to clear up an awful lot of
time for me.

334
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,463
And so my health is good.
I've lost about 50 pounds because I've 

335
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:57,540
stopped eating carbohydrates almost 
completely.

336
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,810
And so that's bloody unbelievable.
I'm back down to the weight I was when I

337
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:01,644
was 30 and uh,
I think that I'm going to get on top of 

338
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:05,184
my health problems.
And my daughter who's had 

339
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,570
extraordinarily serious health problems,
including two hip,

340
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,170
like a hip replacement when she was 16 
and an ankle replacement.

341
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:14,550
She,
when she was also 16,

342
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:18,780
she walked around on two broken legs for
a whole year in excruciating agony.

343
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,853
Like she's figured a lot of this out and
she's offer auntie or her immune 

344
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:25,320
suppressant medication and all sorts of 
other things.

345
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:29,130
So it's a painstaking process.
And I've been eating nothing,

346
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,993
literally nothing but beef,
chicken and salad for a whole month 

347
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,850
trying to figure out where my dietary 
sensitivities are.

348
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:38,430
But so anyways,
that's a long answer to your question,

349
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:40,680
but I'm feeling pretty damn good.
And if I can,

350
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,250
I've got a few more administrative 
matters that are chasing me around,

351
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:47,310
but I think I can get on top of them.
And then man,

352
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:49,740
I'm going to be back at it and that's 
going to be real fun.

353
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,000
So,
okay,

354
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:53,220
let's see what else we got for live 
questions here.

355
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,800
What would I say the male to female 
ratio is in my classrooms currently?

356
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,240
Oh yeah.
There's no men man.

357
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:05,220
It's like 80% women in my psychology 
classes and in 10 years there won't be a

358
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:08,220
mountain left in the humanities unless 
they go online.

359
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,400
In which case maybe it'll only be man.
Cause I know,

360
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,234
I don't think so.
But most of the people who are watching 

361
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:17,760
my videos are men.
It's about 90 91% actually.

362
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,390
So yeah,
the men are bailing out of university,

363
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:22,224
like it's just unbelievable.
And that's been happening for about 30 

364
00:19:24,781 --> 00:19:26,310
years.
So,

365
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,050
um,
it might,

366
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,470
if things don't change and if the 
president linear trends continue,

367
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,690
then yeah,
it'll be all women by,

368
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:38,750
by 2025 and that's really not good.
Not that it's good,

369
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,580
not good because there are so many 
women,

370
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,160
it's not good because there aren't any 
men.

371
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,440
And obviously that's not good for the 
women either,

372
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:48,090
cause I don't know where they're going 
to find their men.

373
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,920
So.
All right.

374
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,920
What are your thoughts on the book of 
revelation in the Bible?

375
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,720
It freaked me out when I was a kid.
Yeah.

376
00:19:54,721 --> 00:19:55,560
Well hell I should say.

377
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,360
So man,
if you're an adult and you read it,

378
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:59,610
it should freak you out.
What are my thoughts on it?

379
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,000
I think it's a,
I think it's the,

380
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:02,800
uh,
uh,

381
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,020
count of a,
a hallucinogenic trip probably.

382
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,940
Um,
probably,

383
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,553
uh,
what would you call caused by silicide 

384
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,350
mushrooms?
Maybe,

385
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,740
maybe I'm Anita Mascara,
um,

386
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,630
which were,
was identified by a guy named last saw,

387
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,490
uh,
about 25,

388
00:20:20,491 --> 00:20:21,324
30 years ago,
maybe even more as the Soma of the 

389
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,560
ancient Hindus.
So yeah,

390
00:20:25,561 --> 00:20:26,394
I think it's a hallucination.
I think it's an account of an extremely 

391
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:31,620
profound hallucinogenic trip that that's
what I think.

392
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,670
I mean what it means,
that's a whole different issue.

393
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:36,504
And I'm going to try to address that 
when and if I get to the book of 

394
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:43,890
revelations in my Biblical series,
but that's going to be probably a couple

395
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:44,723
of years in the future at the rate I'm 
going because it's taken me three weeks 

396
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,760
to get through genesis one.

397
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,830
So,
all right.

398
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:53,860
Violet Irwin says,
I look great while violet,

399
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,840
your Avatar looks great too.
Well,

400
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:57,880
thank you.
Part of the reason I look great,

401
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:58,743
I think to the degree that I do is that 
I have a very good camera that my son 

402
00:21:02,231 --> 00:21:03,064
helped me purchase.
So it makes me look a hell of a lot 

403
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:06,820
better than I actually do look.
So anyways,

404
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:08,830
I appreciate the sentiment.
All right.

405
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,023
Do I see any downside to a child being 
raised by his father in the first three 

406
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:15,340
years while the mother is working full 
time?

407
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,210
Are there psychological consequences for
the child to be expected?

408
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,463
Um,
I think that depends very much on the 

409
00:21:22,391 --> 00:21:25,300
individual situation in the family.
Um,

410
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,373
I'm not convinced that the art of infant
care is something that a tremendous 

411
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:36,550
number of males are highly specialized 
for.

412
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:37,384
I think you have to have a feminine 
temperament and that would mean to do 

413
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:41,920
it,
to do infant care properly.

414
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,200
And that would mean that you have to be 
at least very agreeable and maybe you'll

415
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,043
also be,
have to be relatively high in 

416
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:48,934
neuroticism so that you respond rapidly 
enough to the distress cries of the 

417
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:52,744
child.
And I also think that in order to bond 

418
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,873
the way that you have to bond when 
you're a mother who's taking care of an 

419
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:02,380
infant,
let's say under nine months,

420
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:03,214
I think some of the biochemical 
transformations that accompany 

421
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,520
pregnancy,
childbirth and lactation probably set up

422
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:11,110
the proper,
uh,

423
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,550
biochemical,
underlying,

424
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:16,990
biochemical and psychological mill you 
that makes the kind of bonding that,

425
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:22,890
that increases the probability of high 
level care possible in those few months.

426
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,823
That doesn't mean that men can't do it.
But I would also say in my experience 

427
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:29,500
that it's kind of hard on men.
You know,

428
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,970
it's a complicated issue.
But like one of the things I experienced

429
00:22:33,971 --> 00:22:35,290
and I really liked kits,
you know,

430
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,590
like I love kids and they generally 
respond really well to me.

431
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:39,803
Um,
babies there are different matter 

432
00:22:41,411 --> 00:22:42,244
because I'm,
I don't really feel fully qualified to 

433
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,910
give a baby what it needs.
And I guess,

434
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:50,200
you know,
that's partly because,

435
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,690
you know,
breastfeeding at least so far is,

436
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,710
is,
uh,

437
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,070
firmly in the domain of women.
Um,

438
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,153
in fact it's one of the ways by which 
you could define women if we were 

439
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:01,450
actually into that sort of thing.
Um,

440
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:06,490
so I think that there are circumstances 
under which that's a good thing to do.

441
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:07,324
And actually I had a business partner,
have a business partner who has helped 

442
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:13,150
me develop the self authoring suite.
Very smart guy named Daniel Higgins,

443
00:23:13,151 --> 00:23:17,530
who's a mit engineer and also has a phd 
in psychology from Harvard.

444
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:21,460
And he spent a lot of his time taking 
care of his kids when they were little.

445
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,760
His wife was going to medical school and
he's a pretty masculine guy.

446
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,103
And,
uh,

447
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,240
it was hard on him,
man.

448
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,310
Like it just about killed him.
And,

449
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,383
I mean,
they didn't have a lot of money and she 

450
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,950
was going through medical school and 
they had two and then three little kids.

451
00:23:35,951 --> 00:23:36,641
And so,
you know,

452
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:38,350
that's a very busy time of life.
But,

453
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,683
um,
he did it and he did a great job and he 

454
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:45,920
has wonderful kids and he paid a hell of
a lot of attention to them.

455
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:48,260
But he,
it was not easy.

456
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,270
It was not easy for him.
And you know,

457
00:23:50,271 --> 00:23:51,104
my wife,
when I watched her with our little kids 

458
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:53,144
when they were infants in particular,
like she had had an affinity and a 

459
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:56,834
proclivity for that sort of thing.
And my wife is actually a pretty tough 

460
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:00,044
cookie.
And I wouldn't say overwhelmingly 

461
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:03,134
feminine by temperament.
She's kind of disagreeable and quite 

462
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:08,600
emotionally stable rather than being 
agreeable and,

463
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,493
and high in neuroticism,
which is a more typical set of feminine 

464
00:24:13,311 --> 00:24:14,120
traits.

465
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,000
She was so damn good with infants.
It was just unbelievable.

466
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:17,834
You know?
And I do think that the biochemical 

467
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,440
transformations that accompany pregnancy
and so forth do facilitate that.

468
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,303
I've also seen that with my sister who 
is quite a masculine woman and very 

469
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:28,790
adventurous man.
She,

470
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:29,624
uh,
she smuggled a Mercedes trucks across 

471
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:34,184
the Sahara desert in the 1980s from 
France down through the whole Sahara 

472
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:40,880
into Niger and,
uh,

473
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:46,280
Babysat orphan gorillas in the Congo and
ran safaris through Africa.

474
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,143
Like she's,
she's a very adventurous person and she 

475
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,430
took a lot after my father who's quite a
tough guy,

476
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,210
but you know,
she had kids when she was 40.

477
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,073
Luckily for her and man,
she turned into my mother overnight and 

478
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:00,880
I really liked my mother,
you know,

479
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,810
like that's no insult.
Believe me,

480
00:25:02,811 --> 00:25:04,660
she's a,
she's a really great person,

481
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,600
very,
very caring,

482
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:07,820
very kind,
probably to her own detriment.

483
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:13,120
But to see my sister transform into this
tough masculine person who I respected a

484
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:14,700
lot.
Um,

485
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:19,700
for exactly those virtues into,
into mum was really quite remarkable.

486
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:22,100
And to think that there's nothing 
biochemical about that.

487
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:22,911
It's really,
I think,

488
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:23,744
quite naive and you know,
and pointless because of course there's 

489
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:29,594
something biochemical about,
about birth and childcare for God's 

490
00:25:32,961 --> 00:25:33,794
sake.
It's been going on for like ever since 

491
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,330
sexual dimorphism emerged on the 
evolutionary landscape.

492
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,913
So that's that.
Do you think that boys in our society 

493
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:47,720
are in need of a concrete transition to 
man who had like a modern day initiation

494
00:25:47,721 --> 00:25:48,554
ritual?

495
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:55,750
It probably doesn't matter whether 
they're in need of it,

496
00:25:55,751 --> 00:25:56,584
they're not going to get it.
Cause you can't really just invent 

497
00:25:58,211 --> 00:25:59,260
something like that.
Right.

498
00:25:59,261 --> 00:26:00,094
It has to be,
it's something that evolves over a very 

499
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:05,620
long period of time.
I do think that what they need,

500
00:26:05,621 --> 00:26:06,454
and I really observed this interestingly
enough in the response that young men 

501
00:26:09,491 --> 00:26:10,324
have had to my public talks and probably
on Youtube as well with regards to what 

502
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:16,330
I've been saying,
because you know,

503
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,343
young people have been fed this pablum 
since the 1960s that the pathway to 

504
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,640
happiness and freedom in life,
first of all,

505
00:26:24,641 --> 00:26:26,860
that those are the things that you're 
supposed to be after,

506
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:29,560
especially happiness and that there to 
be found in,

507
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,980
in like rights and untrammeled freedom.
And that's complete.

508
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,113
Uh,
that's completely one sided because for 

509
00:26:35,951 --> 00:26:36,784
every right there is a corresponding 
responsibility and freedom can be chaos 

510
00:26:40,271 --> 00:26:41,650
just as much as it can be.

511
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,580
Um,
you know,

512
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,413
blissful,
lack of responsibility and the ability 

513
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:48,300
to make,
he don't act choices one after another.

514
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,940
And I've been speaking to young men in 
particular.

515
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,550
They're the ones who keep coming to my 
talks by the way,

516
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,390
about truth in action and 
responsibility.

517
00:26:57,391 --> 00:26:59,160
And like they're eating that up.
It's there.

518
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:01,680
I can see their eyes light up,
which is so cool.

519
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:02,923
I,
I've been talking to the people who ran 

520
00:27:03,991 --> 00:27:06,060
for the conservative leadership in 
Canada,

521
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,253
um,
about the fact that when I go talk to 

522
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,190
male audiences,
especially young men,

523
00:27:11,191 --> 00:27:16,191
that they're unbelievably enthralled by 
any discussion of genuine responsibility

524
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:17,064
and truth.
And so the conservatives have something 

525
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:19,104
to offer young man.
And I would say that's roughly akin to 

526
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:22,740
an initiation.
You know,

527
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:26,220
the idea is that at some point you have 
to tell young men,

528
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,140
look,
grow the hell up.

529
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,500
Take on some responsibility,
straighten yourself out,

530
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,030
uh,
act honestly,

531
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,790
make yourself into an an admirable and 
powerful character.

532
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,653
Not because you're

533
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,620
domesticated like a bloody puppy or a 
sheep,

534
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,420
but because that's the way to genuine 
authority and influence and,

535
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,090
and the capacity to do great good in the
world.

536
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:50,070
And that's like an exciting call to 
adventure.

537
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:55,071
And I think that that's a modern,
sophisticated intellectual equivalent to

538
00:27:55,981 --> 00:27:56,814
something like on initiation ritual.
And so I hope to be like promoting that 

539
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:04,750
message more and more.
I was speaking to member of,

540
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,571
uh,
like,

541
00:28:05,571 --> 00:28:06,404
uh,
one of the leaders of the indigenous 

542
00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:07,944
communities in Canada today about maybe 
getting the high school version of the 

543
00:28:11,611 --> 00:28:13,980
future authoring program,
not future authoring program.

544
00:28:13,981 --> 00:28:16,310
I've talked about that a bit before on 
Patrion.

545
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,153
You know,
it's a program at self authoring Dotcom 

546
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:23,820
that enables people to generate a vision
for their lives and also to,

547
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:24,654
uh,

548
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,160
okay.

549
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,440
And to detail out that vision and make a
plan of it.

550
00:28:27,441 --> 00:28:28,274
I think most of you,
patriots subscribers have got links to 

551
00:28:30,081 --> 00:28:30,914
that already and usernames and passwords
and hasn't really remarkably positive 

552
00:28:34,581 --> 00:28:37,550
effect on young men who are 
disenfranchised,

553
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:38,384
who tend to be ethnic minorities.
And so initiating them into the idea 

554
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:42,374
that they need to take control of their 
own destiny and that that's the proper 

555
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:48,230
pathway to authority and stature and,
and not self esteem,

556
00:28:48,231 --> 00:28:50,630
but self respect,
which is a completely different thing,

557
00:28:50,631 --> 00:28:54,380
I think is a reasonable modern 
equivalent to initiation ritual.

558
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,353
Okay,
so let's take another live question 

559
00:28:57,831 --> 00:28:58,800
here.
Um,

560
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,473
okay.

561
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,503
Brennan B says,
I'm halfway finished cleaning my 

562
00:29:05,921 --> 00:29:09,520
disaster of a room while I've got 
something terrible to admit people,

563
00:29:09,521 --> 00:29:12,730
because at the moment I'm sitting in my 
room and it isn't clean.

564
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,460
The back behind here where you can see 
as clean,

565
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:19,150
but because the events of the last seven
months have been so overwhelming,

566
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,403
I would say that there's a certain 
amount of chaos that has invaded my 

567
00:29:22,631 --> 00:29:23,464
immediate environment.
But I have plans to get this place 

568
00:29:26,171 --> 00:29:29,650
sorted out in a serious way over the 
next few months from top,

569
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:33,310
from bottom of the host to the talk.
So halfway Brendan,

570
00:29:33,311 --> 00:29:34,144
that's a good deal.
And there's real psychological 

571
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:36,970
consequences to that.
You know,

572
00:29:36,971 --> 00:29:40,030
because the,
if you're interested in this,

573
00:29:40,031 --> 00:29:42,010
everyone here's really sophisticated

574
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,821
book,
you could read,

575
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:46,060
you could take a look at Carl humans 
last book,

576
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:50,230
which was called mysterium conjunction 
is so that it's Latin.

577
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,513
Um,
now the first part of that book is 

578
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:55,870
really kind of like have a dictionary of
symbolism.

579
00:29:55,871 --> 00:29:59,140
He wrote it I think in his eighties,
and I think he was trying to get down as

580
00:29:59,141 --> 00:30:01,360
much as he could of what he knew as fast
as he could.

581
00:30:01,361 --> 00:30:02,194
So the first part is a dictionary of 
symbolism and it's very difficult to 

582
00:30:04,661 --> 00:30:06,700
read unless you've read a lot of his 
other writing.

583
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,953
But the second part of the book,
which I think is an absolute work of 

584
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:10,774
genius,
you'll makes a couple of propositions 

585
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:13,414
about higher order moral development.
And so I'm going to run through them 

586
00:30:15,611 --> 00:30:17,950
really quickly and,
and described their symbolism.

587
00:30:17,951 --> 00:30:18,784
So he said the first thing that you want
to do if you're going to get your act 

588
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:22,130
together,
um,

589
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,250
and this is like an extension of the,
of the Piagetian notion of,

590
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,420
of stages of moral development.

591
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,830
He said,
you know,

592
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:31,450
you have an intellect,
um,

593
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,063
and you have a set of emotions and 
motivations and you can conceptualize 

594
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:37,174
the intellect symbolically as masculine 
and the emotions and motivations 

595
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:43,300
symbolically as feminine.
And so the first conjunction,

596
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,643
which is the bringing together of the 
masculine and feminine to make a 

597
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:49,690
complete being,
would be the union of the intellect with

598
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:50,524
the emotions and motivations so that 
you're not fighting your deeper 

599
00:30:54,191 --> 00:30:57,040
motivations with your thought.
You know,

600
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:58,900
that they're all moving in the same 
direction.

601
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,360
And so that would be conjunction number 
one.

602
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,583
And so then that makes you united in 
terms of your capability for subjective 

603
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:07,684
experience.
You're all pointing and all of that's 

604
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,800
pointing in the same direction.
And it's one of the things that can make

605
00:31:11,801 --> 00:31:14,230
you unstoppable because you're not at 
war with yourself.

606
00:31:14,231 --> 00:31:16,690
That,
and so the next conjunction as far as he

607
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:19,390
was concerned,
was also expressed symbolically.

608
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:23,800
So now you have the masculine union of 
intellect,

609
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,240
emotion,
and motivation.

610
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,153
And then you have the body,
which you can now conceptualize this 

611
00:31:28,811 --> 00:31:29,644
feminine.
So then you bring those together in a 

612
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:31,874
creative union.
And so that means that you start to act 

613
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,433
out what you think and feel so that 
there's no paradoxical relationship or 

614
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:41,703
or enacted lie,
they call that a performative 

615
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:47,650
contradiction between what you think and
feel and what you do.

616
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,083
And that's,
and so because part of being honest is 

617
00:31:51,191 --> 00:31:54,370
that you act out what you believe.
Right?

618
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,530
And so that's great.
So that's the next conjunction.

619
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,573
And so that makes you integrated in mind
and emotion and motivation and in 

620
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,170
enacted,
enacted routine and body.

621
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,213
Great.
So that's another way of bringing 

622
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:08,044
yourself together.
But the third conjunction is the one 

623
00:32:10,871 --> 00:32:11,704
that's most interesting and it's also 
the one that's most difficult to 

624
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:14,314
understand.

625
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:19,500
And that conjunction occurs when you 
take this unified mind body continuum,

626
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:21,760
let's say.
And you think,

627
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,110
well wait a second,
there's an,

628
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:26,980
there's an element of that missing.
And that's my experience,

629
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:30,730
my experience of the world that's 
hypothetically outside of me.

630
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:33,790
Or that's hypothetically not me.
Now you know,

631
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,223
the,
your experience of the world outside 

632
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,043
that's not you is a very strange 
experience because it isn't self 

633
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:43,580
evident.
For example,

634
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:48,581
to me that my wife is not me.
We spend so much time together.

635
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,453
She's in my experience so much we have a
joint past and a present and a joint 

636
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,670
future.
The same with my kids and the people who

637
00:32:58,671 --> 00:32:59,504
were close to me.
It isn't obvious to me that my wife is 

638
00:33:01,971 --> 00:33:02,804
less valuable to me than I am to me.
She certainly more valuable to me than 

639
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:10,550
some arbitrary body part,
like an arm or a leg,

640
00:33:10,551 --> 00:33:11,384
you know?

641
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,313
And people are perfectly capable of 
making gestures of physical self 

642
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:19,370
sacrifice in order to rescue people that
they love.

643
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,593
And so just exactly who you are and just
exactly who the external world is not 

644
00:33:24,981 --> 00:33:25,814
clear at all.
And so the last conjunction for young 

645
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:28,964
was the eradication of the distinction 
between your subjective experience as 

646
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,360
you and your object of experience as 
you,

647
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,763
which is to say for example,
that if I'm walking down the street and 

648
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:41,474
I encounter someone in trouble and that 
trouble calls to me as something that I 

649
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:46,094
could conceivably do something about.
The fact that that trouble isn't sat 

650
00:33:50,181 --> 00:33:51,014
right in the world is actually is 
actually because it's part of my 

651
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:57,290
experience is actually my problem.
Now,

652
00:33:57,291 --> 00:34:00,350
that doesn't mean that it's my fault,
although it might be,

653
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,410
might not be.
Perhaps it isn't,

654
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,303
but it might be,
but it's still my responsibility and 

655
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:11,420
it's reasonable to consider the 
disruption in my experiential field than

656
00:34:11,421 --> 00:34:16,421
encountering someone who is in trouble,
produces as an actual disturbance in my,

657
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,463
in my being,
and then to act as if it's my 

658
00:34:21,471 --> 00:34:23,930
responsibility to rectify that 
disturbance.

659
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,900
Now the problem of course comes in that 
you don't know how.

660
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:29,510
So if you run across a street alcoholic,
for example,

661
00:34:29,511 --> 00:34:30,344
in the middle of the day and they're 
stumbling wrong blindly and maybe their 

662
00:34:32,811 --> 00:34:35,330
schizophrenia to boot and mumbling 
terrible things,

663
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:36,523
you know it's going to disturb you and 
it would be good if you could set it 

664
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:40,940
right,
but you don't know how.

665
00:34:40,941 --> 00:34:42,770
So you can't,
you have to avoid it.

666
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,630
But that doesn't mean that that isn't 
you because it's also you.

667
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,810
And I think that's why in the story of 
the Buddha,

668
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:51,644
for example,
like the Buddha was basically offered 

669
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:56,840
when he became enlightened,
the chance to remain in Nirvana,

670
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:00,890
right as a uniquely enlightened,
singular individual.

671
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,083
And he actually regret rejected that 
offer because it was his deepest 

672
00:35:07,581 --> 00:35:11,840
conviction that it was,
it was not possible for one person to be

673
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:12,674
enlightened and to be in a state of 
Nevada if everyone wasn't in that state 

674
00:35:16,161 --> 00:35:16,994
at the same time.
And so he had to move himself out of 

675
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:24,551
that Utopian experience of Nirvana and 
come back to the normal world,

676
00:35:25,221 --> 00:35:27,920
let's say.
And to try to raise the consciousness of

677
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:32,900
people around him because he regarded 
that as unfinished business.

678
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:35,360
That was his personally.
And so

679
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,050
now

680
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,880
I don't remember who was I.
Oh yes.

681
00:35:39,881 --> 00:35:42,280
That's all about cleaning your room.
You have six actually,

682
00:35:42,281 --> 00:35:43,031
so,
well,

683
00:35:43,031 --> 00:35:45,190
the thing is,
is that your,

684
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,380
your room isn't,
not you.

685
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:48,410
Yeah,

686
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,520
it's actually you.

687
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:50,900
Yeah.

688
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,733
And so there's no difference between the
chaos that's outside of you in a place 

689
00:35:55,551 --> 00:35:56,384
that you spend as much time as you spend
in your room and the chaos that's 

690
00:35:59,781 --> 00:36:02,270
internal psychologically.
And you know,

691
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,163
one of the things I often do when I'm 
first dealing with my clients as a 

692
00:36:06,591 --> 00:36:10,400
simple exercise in setting themselves,
right psychologically,

693
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,810
is to have them start to clean up their 
external environment.

694
00:36:14,811 --> 00:36:15,644
Because if people know how to do that,
and there's no difference between that 

695
00:36:18,621 --> 00:36:21,380
and putting yourself straight 
psychologically as you know,

696
00:36:21,381 --> 00:36:24,580
when you do something as serious as 
starting to clean up or your omen.

697
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,453
So Brendan,
the other thing I would say is like 

698
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,153
finish cleaning your room and then see 
if you can make it beautiful because 

699
00:36:31,491 --> 00:36:35,300
that's also unbelievably useful man,
because it teaches you about beauty.

700
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,450
And so then you can make one room in 
your house beautiful.

701
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,180
And then it's organized and together and
beautiful.

702
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,373
And so once you do that with one room,
like you're way wiser than you were 

703
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:45,494
before and you've actually accomplished 
something concrete that's solid and in 

704
00:36:48,921 --> 00:36:52,250
controvertible that you can point to 
that strengthens your character.

705
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,860
And then maybe you can do the same thing
with your whole house.

706
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,400
And then maybe you can do that with the 
more with the world around you.

707
00:36:58,401 --> 00:37:00,470
And believe me,
if you start doing that,

708
00:37:00,471 --> 00:37:03,740
you're not going to be sitting around 
wondering what the meaning of life is,

709
00:37:03,741 --> 00:37:06,230
because you're going to find it in that.
So,

710
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,990
all right,
so let's see.

711
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,183
MMM.

712
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:15,920
Max and mark says,
thoughts on the Jews.

713
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,570
Well,
that's complicated.

714
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:19,700
Most of them,
most of my friends are Jews,

715
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,440
which is pretty interesting,
you know,

716
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:24,440
and when I grew up in northern Alberta 
and there were no Jews up there at all,

717
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:25,640
so,
um,

718
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:29,120
it coming out to eastern Canada,
especially Montreal,

719
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:32,060
there were lots of Jewish people there.
And I made friends with lots of them.

720
00:37:32,061 --> 00:37:34,160
And then in,
in Toronto,

721
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,550
like,
and I said,

722
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,493
I think part of the reason that so many 
of my friends have been Jewish is 

723
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:41,410
because the Jews have,
you know,

724
00:37:41,411 --> 00:37:44,180
and I'm obviously speaking in a very 
general sense,

725
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:48,230
is they have a rich intellectual life 
and tremendous respect for,

726
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:52,550
for intellectual pursuits.
And so we have a natural affinity.

727
00:37:52,551 --> 00:37:53,960
And so,
um,

728
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,423
you know,
more power to them as far as I'm 

729
00:37:56,601 --> 00:37:57,710
concerned.
There's a fair,

730
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:01,010
there's a fair bit of evidence,
especially with regards to the Ashkenazi

731
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:02,140
Jews that they,
they're,

732
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,720
they're average Iq is or about 15 points
higher than the general population,

733
00:38:05,721 --> 00:38:06,554
which accounts in part for the radical 
overrepresentation among Nobel prize 

734
00:38:10,071 --> 00:38:11,030
winners for example.

735
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,863
And also in positions of let's say 
authority and responsibility in many 

736
00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:16,670
different domains.
And it's like,

737
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,510
man,
I'm not unhappy about successful people.

738
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,070
It's like,
as I said,

739
00:38:22,071 --> 00:38:26,030
it's the same in relationship to money 
as far as I'm concerned.

740
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,690
It's not that you have a position of 
authority and I'm not going to say power

741
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:31,670
because power and authority aren't the 
same thing,

742
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:36,220
but if you have a position of authority,
what is what you do with it.

743
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,880
And so if competent people occupy 
positions of authority,

744
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:42,190
then more power to them.
That's lucky for the rest of us.

745
00:38:42,191 --> 00:38:43,390
I'll tell you that.
So,

746
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,250
um,
and I think,

747
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:46,084
you know,
I've often thought this about the Jews 

748
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:48,274
too,
is that if you're going to be a 

749
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:49,774
minority,
you should at least have the decency to 

750
00:38:51,011 --> 00:38:53,030
fail.
And I think that part of the reason,

751
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,130
because you know,
then,

752
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,233
well,
you're around and you're annoying 

753
00:38:56,171 --> 00:38:57,370
because you're a minority.

754
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,203
And you know,
because people are fundamentally a 

755
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,590
ethnocentric and all human beings are 
like that.

756
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,620
But if a minority fails,
then why you can say,

757
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:07,360
well at least they failed.
And you know,

758
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:09,910
that may be lousy,
not to hate them quite as much,

759
00:39:09,911 --> 00:39:10,744
but the Jews have this annoying 
proclivity where they go as a minority 

760
00:39:14,081 --> 00:39:17,200
to become extremely successful.
And of course nobody can stand that.

761
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:19,720
And so that's a huge part of what 
accounts for antisemitism,

762
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:23,020
which are regarded as an absolutely.
I know a bismal and,

763
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,640
and,
and uh,

764
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,160
what would you call it?
Reprehensible.

765
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,680
A Priori stats,
you know.

766
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:32,650
So that's some of my thoughts about 
them.

767
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:33,520
Anyways.
All right,

768
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,383
next.

769
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,520
How did I meet my wife?
And why did you marry her?

770
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,853
Oh,
well I'll tell you one of the earliest 

771
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,303
memories I have my wife,
cause it kind of tells me what she's 

772
00:39:46,991 --> 00:39:47,740
like,
Eh.

773
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,573
So she lived across the street from me 
in this little town that we grew up in 

774
00:39:51,311 --> 00:39:52,480
called fairview,
Alberta.

775
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,640
And I think I fell in love with her the 
moment that I saw her and I,

776
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,050
although I don't think the feeling was 
necessarily mutual.

777
00:39:59,051 --> 00:40:01,690
And so I was about like seven I think,
something like that.

778
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:02,524
So I've known her for like 48 years.
And here's one memory because this is 

779
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,550
their two memories,
I'll tell you.

780
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:10,384
So one of them was when I was in grade 
five I got glasses and I was pretty 

781
00:40:14,921 --> 00:40:17,080
proud of these classes.
They were horn rimmed glasses,

782
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,520
you know,
and I was pretty proud of them.

783
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,353
And I went out and I,
she came out onto the street and she 

784
00:40:22,451 --> 00:40:23,530
looked at my glasses.
I said,

785
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:24,700
what are you thinking of that was,
and she says,

786
00:40:24,701 --> 00:40:25,534
I think you look really funny in those.
And then she pointed at me and ran into 

787
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:28,924
her house.
And it wasn't like 20 years later that 

788
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:31,743
she finally told me that she had always 
wanted to have glasses and she was 

789
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:35,350
jealous about it,
but you know,

790
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:37,900
she decided she'd give me a good teasing
and a good poke.

791
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:38,734
And so that,
and then we used to play croquet 

792
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:41,434
together.
And one of the great delights she would 

793
00:40:43,511 --> 00:40:44,344
take is,
I don't know if you've ever laid 

794
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:45,850
croquet,
but you know,

795
00:40:45,851 --> 00:40:46,684
you're sometimes the one person's ball 
that they're hitting and another 

796
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:51,064
person's will come together and then you
can stand on your ball and you can nail 

797
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:56,840
it with the croquet mallet and like 
knock the other person's,

798
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:59,830
um,
croquet ball halfway down the block.

799
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,650
And she used to think that was pretty 
damn amusing when she did it to me.

800
00:41:02,651 --> 00:41:04,000
So,
and,

801
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,650
uh,
let's see,

802
00:41:05,651 --> 00:41:08,530
what else can I remember about her that 
was,

803
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,521
but yeah,
I mean,

804
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:13,570
I told my dad when I was in grade five,
I was sitting with her on this big

805
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:19,440
armchair in our living room,
and she was sitting beside me on the arm

806
00:41:19,441 --> 00:41:20,980
chair,
which I was pretty damn thrilled about.

807
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:24,490
And she was being chased around by all 
the boys in the school at that point,

808
00:41:24,491 --> 00:41:26,440
even though she,
that was in the elementary school,

809
00:41:26,441 --> 00:41:28,210
you know,
so she was very,

810
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,500
uh,
hot property,

811
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:31,750
let's say,
among the elementary school boys.

812
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,830
And so I was pretty happy to have her 
sit by me.

813
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:34,664
And so anyway,
she left and I told my dad that I was 

814
00:41:38,181 --> 00:41:42,380
going to marry her
and,

815
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:43,214
uh,
I remember that and he told that story 

816
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:45,890
at our wedding,
which was quite cute.

817
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,860
And then I'll tell you one more story,
which I really think it's funny.

818
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,720
This is so funny.
So we,

819
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,410
we were friends when we were kids and 
then,

820
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,453
you know,
girls mature faster than boys and she's 

821
00:41:57,471 --> 00:41:59,630
a year older than me cause I skipped a 
grade in school.

822
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,460
We were in the same grade in school.
And so,

823
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,430
you know,
when she hit about 13 or so,

824
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,170
we kind of went our separate ways a 
little bit,

825
00:42:06,171 --> 00:42:07,004
although we still remained friends and 
she had a paper route and I took her 

826
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:15,461
paper route over when she hit 13 or so 
and I like quadrupled the damn thing,

827
00:42:16,071 --> 00:42:17,570
I think,
which I think is pretty funny.

828
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:18,703
But,
um,

829
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,490
I also delivered paper to her house and,
um,

830
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,180
one day she was there with a number 
other of her friends and,

831
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:26,800
uh,
who was,

832
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,250
uh,
kind of a cute chick too.

833
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,083
And I liked her quite a bit and they 
were sitting around talking about like 

834
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,910
talking about how they were,
uh,

835
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,560
feminists,
roughly speaking.

836
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:37,394
And they were talking when I walked in 
about the fact that neither of them are 

837
00:42:40,241 --> 00:42:43,520
going to take their husbands last day 
when they got married.

838
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:44,870
And,
uh,

839
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,100
Tammy,
my wife,

840
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,993
I think said to her friend,
while that really means I'm going to 

841
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:50,654
have to find some wimp and marry him.
And she turned around and looked at me 

842
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:56,780
and smiled evilee and said,
Hey Jordan,

843
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,063
do you want to get married?
And of course I'd heard the whole 

844
00:42:59,361 --> 00:43:02,390
conversation and you know,
she knew I liked her obviously.

845
00:43:02,391 --> 00:43:03,224
And so that was nice little comical.
Desc she has a very vicious sense of 

846
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:07,070
humor and,
you know,

847
00:43:07,071 --> 00:43:08,650
I kind of laughed and I thought,
how,

848
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,470
okay,
yeah.

849
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,730
Okay,
so fine.

850
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:14,360
So then
what we were,

851
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:19,310
I was like 28 and she had come to see me
in Montreal and,

852
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,713
um,
we were talking about getting married 

853
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:23,653
and she said,
we were talking about what that would 

854
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:26,150
mean.

855
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,430
And then we started talking about what 
the name would be.

856
00:43:28,431 --> 00:43:29,151
And I said,
Hey,

857
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,010
I've got a story for you.
Um,

858
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,340
you remember when you were 13 and I was 
delivering papers to your house.

859
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,473
And,
uh,

860
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:40,310
cause I suggested that she take my last 
name and she wasn't so sure about that.

861
00:43:40,311 --> 00:43:41,001
And I said,
well,

862
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:44,090
you remember that little story,
that little episode that we had when you

863
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:44,924
were 13 and I came over to your house 
and you told me that you weren't going 

864
00:43:47,451 --> 00:43:50,750
to take your husband's name and that 
you're going to have to marry some wimp.

865
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,651
Said,
okay,

866
00:43:51,651 --> 00:43:52,430
well,
you know,

867
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:53,600
here I am,
but you know,

868
00:43:53,601 --> 00:43:55,580
if we're going to get married,
you're going to take my name.

869
00:43:55,581 --> 00:43:57,560
And that's the end of that argument.
And so,

870
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,660
you know,
she had the good graces to go along with

871
00:43:59,661 --> 00:44:00,830
that,
but that was actually,

872
00:44:00,831 --> 00:44:03,740
you know,
stored nearly comical and ridiculous.

873
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:04,740
So,
um,

874
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,580
so yeah,
so that's a good one.

875
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,230
What's my advice to young men seeking a 
woman for marriage and family?

876
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:14,870
Yeah.
Well,

877
00:44:14,871 --> 00:44:15,704
okay,
fine.

878
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,930
That's the same question.
Second question.

879
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,520
That's,
that's pretty straight forward,

880
00:44:19,521 --> 00:44:20,354
man.
I mean,

881
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:24,740
you can't eliminate the necessity of 
being attracted to one another.

882
00:44:24,741 --> 00:44:27,200
That's important.
And that's mysterious,

883
00:44:27,201 --> 00:44:27,980
you know?
Um,

884
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,720
so for example,
here's a funny thing.

885
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,980
If you,
one of the

886
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,250
things we know that attracts people to 
one another is bilateral symmetry.

887
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:41,210
And so if you take men and you ranked 
them by the symmetry of their faces,

888
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,313
and then you give the asymmetrical men 
tee shirts to wear clean t shirts for a 

889
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:51,180
day and the symmetrical men clean t 
shirts to wear for a day.

890
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:55,350
And then you give the tee shirts to 
women and you have them rate the odor,

891
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:56,783
the women rate the odor of the 
symmetrical men as more attractive than 

892
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:03,300
the odor of the asymmetrical men.
And then,

893
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,010
and there were other,
uh,

894
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,233
factors that determined sexual 
attractiveness that are based on 

895
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:12,360
biological factors that are so deeply 
embedded in terms of smell,

896
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:13,290
for example.
So,

897
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:16,380
uh,
women also tend to,

898
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:19,410
uh,
not be sexually attracted to the,

899
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,620
to the scent of men whose,
who have,

900
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,573
if I remember correctly,
it's rh factors that would make for 

901
00:45:26,941 --> 00:45:29,910
potential trouble in childbirth.

902
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:30,953
And the often,
the reason that the women give for not 

903
00:45:33,781 --> 00:45:34,614
preferring the scent of those men is 
that they smell too much like their 

904
00:45:36,811 --> 00:45:38,370
brother,
something like that.

905
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:41,730
So there was weird,
mysterious things that determine whether

906
00:45:41,731 --> 00:45:44,310
or not people are sexually and 
physically attracted to each other.

907
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:48,030
And I think it's very important that 
that's part of a marital relationship.

908
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:51,390
The next most important thing is trust 
man.

909
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:56,450
It's like there's no marriage that 
successful without trust you guys.

910
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,833
You got to tell each other the truth.
And one of the reasons that you don't 

911
00:46:00,481 --> 00:46:05,481
believe that marriage as an an an oath 
and Carl Jung as a bond was necessary.

912
00:46:06,781 --> 00:46:08,220
It's really wise.
It's like,

913
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,353
you know,
telling the truth to someone is no 

914
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,610
simple thing because there's a bunch of 
things about all of us that are terrible

915
00:46:14,611 --> 00:46:18,270
and weak and reprehensible and shameful 
and all of those things and they kind of

916
00:46:18,271 --> 00:46:20,670
have to be brought out into the open and
dealt with.

917
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:21,893
And you're not going to tell the truth 
about yourself to someone who can run 

918
00:46:25,321 --> 00:46:27,510
away screaming when you reveal who you 
are.

919
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,810
And so the,
the marriage bond is something like,

920
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,100
okay,
here's the deal.

921
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,680
I'm going to handcuff myself to you and 
you're going to handcuff yourself to me.

922
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:41,250
And then we're going to tell each other 
the truth and neither of us are going to

923
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:43,230
get to run away.
And so are,

924
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,930
once we know the truth,
then we're either going to live together

925
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:46,764
in mutual torment or we're going to try 
to deal with that truth and straighten 

926
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:51,870
ourselves out and street in ourselves,
out jointly.

927
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:57,080
And that's going to make us more 
powerful and more resilient and more and

928
00:46:57,571 --> 00:47:00,900
deeper and wiser as we progress together
through life.

929
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,153
And,
and I think that's absolutely brilliant 

930
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,880
because if you leave the backdoor open 
mat and you're going to use it,

931
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:06,743
that's for sure.

932
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:07,703
And the oath is there.
And this was young's commentary on the 

933
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:11,154
spiritualization of,
of the human pair boy and by Christian 

934
00:47:15,301 --> 00:47:16,590
marriage for example,
which,

935
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:18,120
which emphasized,
uh,

936
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,800
the,
the,

937
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,310
what would you call it,
the subordination of both members of the

938
00:47:23,311 --> 00:47:27,720
marital union to a higher order,
ah,

939
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,000
personality that embodied in the figure 
of the logos.

940
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:34,720
So the idea is that an an an an an in 
the Christian marriage for example,

941
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:38,140
the man isn't the boss and the woman 
isn't the boss.

942
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:43,260
The boss is the mutual personality 
composed by the seeking of truth in both

943
00:47:44,711 --> 00:47:47,380
of them and that's conceptualized as 
theirs,

944
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:51,460
their joint subjugation to the logos.
And that is absolutely dead on man.

945
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:52,533
It's like the ruler of your marital life
should be your vows to tell each other 

946
00:47:56,831 --> 00:47:57,664
the truth because like in hard times 
during your life when you've done 

947
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,044
something stupid and idiotic,
that might take you down and you don't 

948
00:48:04,931 --> 00:48:06,730
have anybody that you can turn to,
you know,

949
00:48:06,731 --> 00:48:08,560
if you have a partner that you can 
trust,

950
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:09,520
you can go say,
hey,

951
00:48:09,521 --> 00:48:10,354
you know I made a big financial mistake 
man and it's really torturing me and I 

952
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,790
feel like a complete idiot and it's 
really dangerous.

953
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:16,623
And the person there,
it's going to help you figure out what 

954
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:21,070
to do about it.
And they're going to know that when they

955
00:48:21,071 --> 00:48:21,904
make a stupid mistake and they're bloody
well going to that they can come and 

956
00:48:24,161 --> 00:48:26,980
talk to you and that you guys are going 
to work your way through it.

957
00:48:26,981 --> 00:48:27,814
And that's a big deal.
And there's a couple of things our 

958
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:33,580
culture gets really wrong and one is it 
devalues marriage.

959
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:36,640
That's really a very bad idea because 
marriages,

960
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:37,863
marriages like a third of your life and 
maybe more and kids are a third of your 

961
00:48:41,921 --> 00:48:43,540
life and your,
your,

962
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:47,230
your life outside of marriage and kids 
is a third of your life,

963
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,513
you know,
approximately speaking and to miss any 

964
00:48:51,101 --> 00:48:53,950
of that is a massive,
massive mistake.

965
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,440
Now,
having said that,

966
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:57,483
I will also say that for some people,
missing one or more of those is 

967
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,310
necessary because they have a reason.

968
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,713
You know,
maybe they're brilliantly creative 

969
00:49:05,951 --> 00:49:06,784
artists and they need to devote 
themselves entirely to their career or 

970
00:49:09,191 --> 00:49:11,260
their outstanding in some way.
And so they need,

971
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:12,123
they can justify the sacrifice of one 
part of that tryout of being to another 

972
00:49:16,331 --> 00:49:17,164
part but for,
but generally speaking it's a very 

973
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:20,800
dangerous thing and it,
it,

974
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:24,430
it shouldn't be duct.
And also kids get an absolutely terrible

975
00:49:24,431 --> 00:49:25,330
rap,
you know,

976
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:28,870
because kids are delightful if they're 
well behaved.

977
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:29,823
One of the chapters in my new book is 
called don't let your children do 

978
00:49:32,231 --> 00:49:35,110
anything that makes you dislike them and
you can do that.

979
00:49:35,111 --> 00:49:38,440
Especially if you discuss it thoroughly 
with your spouse.

980
00:49:38,441 --> 00:49:41,890
You're the person that's helping you 
discipline the kids and children are the

981
00:49:41,891 --> 00:49:45,580
best company because they're really 
enthusiastic about everything.

982
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,593
They love doing new things.
They really love you so they're happy 

983
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:50,990
that you're around.
Um,

984
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:54,580
all you have to do is make sure they're 
not too hot and they're not too cold and

985
00:49:54,581 --> 00:49:55,414
they've had something to eat and they're
not too tired and you don't expect them 

986
00:49:58,811 --> 00:50:02,740
to stay engaged in something for longer 
than they can manage.

987
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:03,583
Because we used to take our kids when 
they were little out to restaurants for 

988
00:50:05,411 --> 00:50:06,244
example.
And they could sit there and no problem 

989
00:50:07,241 --> 00:50:09,400
and behave really nicely when they were 
two and three,

990
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:12,100
but they couldn't do it for more than 
about 45 minutes.

991
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,113
He can't push your luck.
But I also noticed with little kids is 

992
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:16,474
that they got antsy and unreasonable 
about five to 10 minutes before the 

993
00:50:20,471 --> 00:50:21,304
adults did too.
It's just the adults were too stupid to 

994
00:50:22,961 --> 00:50:24,700
notice.
The kids would notice right away.

995
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:25,953
So,
um,

996
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,300
so back to while you look for someone 
that you're attracted to,

997
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:30,134
that you love,
and then you look for someone that you 

998
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:35,350
can bloody well trust and then you tell 
them the truth and,

999
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:36,303
and that way maybe you can get through 
life and you can have someone to weave 

1000
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,400
the rope of your being with and together
to make,

1001
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,200
to make your joint ropes stronger.

1002
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,500
And you can have some continuity in your
narrative and you can have children.

1003
00:50:48,501 --> 00:50:52,520
And then you can have grandchildren and 
like you can have a life man and there's

1004
00:50:52,521 --> 00:50:53,354
nothing.
You're so fortunate if you can manage 

1005
00:50:55,461 --> 00:50:56,300
that.
And so,

1006
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:58,280
okay,
so there's that one.

1007
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:02,450
So what's my advice to young men seeking
a woman for marriage and family?

1008
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:03,343
Yeah.
Well,

1009
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:05,360
and also,
you know,

1010
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,313
marry someone you think would be a good 
mother and that has enough sense 

1011
00:51:08,781 --> 00:51:11,090
generally speaking,
to know that she wants children.

1012
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:12,103
Now some women don't want children and 
fair enough and some women perhaps 

1013
00:51:15,921 --> 00:51:18,890
shouldn't have children.
That's also possible.

1014
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,500
But the general rule of thumb is,
especially once a woman's,

1015
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:24,710
you know,
inner mid twenties,

1016
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,120
if she doesn't know that she wants 
children or won't admit it,

1017
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:32,990
unless she has a viciously important 
reason,

1018
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:37,490
then she's not oriented properly.
Psychologically she,

1019
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,570
she,
she isn't,

1020
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,820
she doesn't know what's important in 
life.

1021
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,910
Now that might also be the case with you
and it probably is,

1022
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:46,070
but as a rule of thumb,
that's a really good one.

1023
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,220
So,
okay,

1024
00:51:49,221 --> 00:51:52,120
another more spontaneous one here.
Oh,

1025
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:52,963
right.
Um,

1026
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:04,843
on the other hand,
what's your advice to high achieving 

1027
00:52:06,201 --> 00:52:07,680
females for finding a man?

1028
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:17,280
That's a,
that's a tough one.

1029
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:21,450
Do I want to do I want to answer that 
question?

1030
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,590
See the problem that high achieving 
women have.

1031
00:52:25,591 --> 00:52:27,180
And I've dealt with a lot of them,
you know,

1032
00:52:27,181 --> 00:52:28,014
because one of the,
first of all I've have a clinical 

1033
00:52:29,401 --> 00:52:32,640
practice as most of you may know,
and I also had a consulting practice and

1034
00:52:32,641 --> 00:52:34,140
one of the things they were kind of 
mixed,

1035
00:52:34,141 --> 00:52:38,970
but one of the things I did for a long 
time was I served as a consultant to two

1036
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:39,863
people who were spectacularly successful
in their careers because I worked with 

1037
00:52:42,751 --> 00:52:43,584
an agency whose sales pitch basically to
the companies or the law firms because 

1038
00:52:48,121 --> 00:52:48,954
it was mostly law firms was give us your
really high achieving people and we'll 

1039
00:52:52,201 --> 00:52:53,034
help them sort out their lives even more
and make them even more productive and 

1040
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,353
valuable than they already are.
And you don't need much of an increment 

1041
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:00,384
in the value of someone who's high 
achieving to justify that from an 

1042
00:53:02,611 --> 00:53:03,540
economic perspective.

1043
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:04,373
So I work with a lot of high achieving 
people for like 15 years and I still do 

1044
00:53:08,851 --> 00:53:09,684
it to some degree.
And Lot of them were women and a lot of 

1045
00:53:13,261 --> 00:53:14,094
them were female lawyers.
And they were very interesting to work 

1046
00:53:16,381 --> 00:53:19,140
with because most of them were extremely
attractive and they were very,

1047
00:53:19,141 --> 00:53:21,960
very smart and they were tough.
Um,

1048
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,780
and you know,
they were very demanding when it came to

1049
00:53:24,781 --> 00:53:28,260
a,
because women do tend to mate across and

1050
00:53:28,261 --> 00:53:29,094
up dominance hierarchies.
And if you're like very attractive and 

1051
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:34,440
you're very intelligent and you make a 
lot of money and you're very competent,

1052
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:38,640
it's like there's not a lot that's 
across and there's even less that's up.

1053
00:53:38,641 --> 00:53:40,730
And so that's hard on women.
And,

1054
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,660
and it actually,
the way,

1055
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,610
the way that that actually works out is 
that,

1056
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:45,803
especially with regards to Iq for women,
is that the higher the Iq that a woman 

1057
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:51,204
has,
the less likely it is that she's going 

1058
00:53:52,051 --> 00:53:54,990
to find a partner and they effect is 
actually quite pronounced.

1059
00:53:54,991 --> 00:53:57,720
And so that's pretty rough.
What's my advice?

1060
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:13,370
Well,
the first piece of advice probably would

1061
00:54:13,371 --> 00:54:14,204
be,
don't pretend that it's not important 

1062
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,890
because it is important.
And the next piece of advice I would say

1063
00:54:18,891 --> 00:54:21,500
is,
and this is practically speaking,

1064
00:54:21,501 --> 00:54:22,334
is it's a lot easier now for people to 
find at least a potential partner than 

1065
00:54:26,871 --> 00:54:27,704
it was 20 years ago because you have 
this tremendous technology that's 

1066
00:54:30,981 --> 00:54:33,290
available with regards to opening up the
dating market.

1067
00:54:33,291 --> 00:54:37,190
And I would say finding the right mate 
is like finding a good career,

1068
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:40,340
the next good career move.
I know that's not a great analogy,

1069
00:54:40,341 --> 00:54:42,860
but a huge part of that is just 
persistence.

1070
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,920
You have to kiss a lot of frogs before 
you find a prince,

1071
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:46,783
you know?
I suppose that's one way of thinking 

1072
00:54:47,871 --> 00:54:49,220
about it.
And then,

1073
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:56,290
and then I guess I would also say

1074
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,690
that's really about the best I can do,
man.

1075
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,860
It's,
it's a,

1076
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,670
it's a really complicated question.
Look for someone that loves you and that

1077
00:55:05,671 --> 00:55:06,504
wants to take care of you and that,
and that is oriented to some degree 

1078
00:55:09,361 --> 00:55:12,510
towards the same things that you are,
that's also helpful.

1079
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:17,540
But apart from the earlier things I said
about attractiveness and truth,

1080
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,410
you know,
that's about the best I can do.

1081
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,900
It's a very complicated question.
Okay.

1082
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:22,980
Kenny Lauderdale.
Yeah,

1083
00:55:22,981 --> 00:55:25,560
this is a good one.
How do I get over my fear of driving?

1084
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:28,110
I'm an adult and have no driver's 
license and it's crippling.

1085
00:55:28,111 --> 00:55:29,880
Meet ma'am.
That's a really important question.

1086
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:33,140
A lot of young adults,
and I don't know if you're younger,

1087
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:34,020
not,
um,

1088
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:37,290
don't have their driver's license.
And I think that's a catastrophe because

1089
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:39,000
it's a real,
first of all,

1090
00:55:39,001 --> 00:55:39,834
it's,
it's economically suicidal because it 

1091
00:55:41,281 --> 00:55:42,114
makes it very difficult night if you 
live in New York City or somewhere like 

1092
00:55:44,401 --> 00:55:44,640
that.

1093
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,250
But you know,
if you live anywhere else,

1094
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:50,520
you sacrifice your autonomy by not being
able to drive.

1095
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:51,950
Look,
uh,

1096
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:52,913
Kenny,
I would say take a driver's course and 

1097
00:55:55,501 --> 00:55:56,430
do it badly.
It's,

1098
00:55:56,431 --> 00:55:58,200
who cares if you have to do it five 
times,

1099
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,333
you know,
go sit in a car for a while and pretend 

1100
00:56:00,901 --> 00:56:04,650
to drive like you're a kid and then have
them drive you around the block and like

1101
00:56:04,651 --> 00:56:05,484
take it slow.
Maybe it's something that'll take you a 

1102
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:08,930
whole year to learn,
but you're,

1103
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:09,823
you're actually in a really good 
situation to advance yourself 

1104
00:56:12,601 --> 00:56:13,434
psychologically because you know that 
there's something you should do that's 

1105
00:56:16,171 --> 00:56:17,580
learned to drive,
right.

1106
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,460
That's challenging and you know that 
it's interfering with you.

1107
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:21,653
So you have a great opportunity right 
there to overcome that and to improve 

1108
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:26,134
your psychological functioning.
And I would say this is associated with 

1109
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:30,640
the Tarot card.

1110
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,350
The fool,
if you look up that card,

1111
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:35,890
you'll see that the fool is often a 
young man who's about in sunny day,

1112
00:56:35,891 --> 00:56:38,140
who's about to step off a cliff.
You think,

1113
00:56:38,141 --> 00:56:39,450
well,
is that a good Carter,

1114
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,293
a bad card?
It's like the symbolic meaning of that 

1115
00:56:42,731 --> 00:56:46,030
card is that in order to make progress,
you have to be a fool.

1116
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:48,730
And you know you've already admitted 
you're a fool,

1117
00:56:48,731 --> 00:56:50,500
you're afraid,
and you don't know how to drive.

1118
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:52,450
Like you know how pathetic.
Hahaha.

1119
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,560
Yeah.
Okay.

1120
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:55,203
The thing is you accept that is you 
don't know what you're doing and you're 

1121
00:56:57,641 --> 00:56:59,110
going to be a fool while you're doing 
it.

1122
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,153
And,
but you're no where near as much of a 

1123
00:57:01,691 --> 00:57:05,860
fool doing it as a fool than you are as 
a fool avoiding it.

1124
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:09,970
So I would say go find someone 
professionally that can teach you how to

1125
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:10,450
drive.

1126
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:14,170
Find someone that's patient,
tell them that you're nervous about it.

1127
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:17,500
Start in a parking lot that's empty on 
an early Sunday,

1128
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:19,210
more sunny Sunday morning.
You know,

1129
00:57:19,211 --> 00:57:22,240
where you're not going to kill anybody 
and get your damn driver's license.

1130
00:57:22,241 --> 00:57:23,074
It'll do you and unbelievably it'll do.
It'll do you a tremendous amount of 

1131
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,340
good.
So,

1132
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:28,990
so great.
You know,

1133
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:31,070
you say there's this old,
uh,

1134
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:36,500
Al Chemical saying that Carl Jung was 
very fond of which is [inaudible],

1135
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:37,383
which means something like in filth,
it will be found or it means what you 

1136
00:57:41,531 --> 00:57:42,364
most want is where you to be found,
where you eat at least one look and you 

1137
00:57:44,951 --> 00:57:46,480
know where you least bought.
Look man,

1138
00:57:46,481 --> 00:57:49,090
you don't want to look at your ability 
as a driver.

1139
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:51,460
So go fix that.
And it'll really help you out,

1140
00:57:51,461 --> 00:57:52,294
man.
Tanner spell and he suggestions for 

1141
00:57:54,161 --> 00:57:56,530
someone about to start university.
Yeah.

1142
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:57,803
Um,

1143
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:02,933
see if you can find some professors.
They're going to be often going to be 

1144
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:06,024
older people and often older guys who 
still know what the classic scholars 

1145
00:58:11,341 --> 00:58:14,400
knew and stay away from the bloody 
postmodernists.

1146
00:58:14,401 --> 00:58:17,610
Like you might want to take a course 
just so you know what that sort of thing

1147
00:58:17,611 --> 00:58:18,444
is about.
But see if you can find people who are 

1148
00:58:20,011 --> 00:58:22,170
literate,
really literate and who can teach you.

1149
00:58:22,171 --> 00:58:23,004
And so what you do is you shop around,
go to classes more than more classes 

1150
00:58:27,601 --> 00:58:30,270
than you can take at least in the first 
couple of weeks of university.

1151
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:31,343
Listen to the professors and find out 
the ones that are telling you something 

1152
00:58:34,501 --> 00:58:38,040
that you really need to know and then 
follow them and stick with them.

1153
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:42,300
So you have to search out your own path 
to be educated in university.

1154
00:58:42,301 --> 00:58:44,790
The other thing I would say is make a 
schedule.

1155
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,190
Treat university like it's a fulltime 
job.

1156
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:49,560
Make a schedule the first week of 
classes.

1157
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:52,410
Put in your exams,
like in Google calendar.

1158
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:55,560
Put in your assignments,
make a plan to,

1159
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,000
um,
to make the,

1160
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:57,983
to get the assignments done.
Start early because lots of kids end up 

1161
00:59:00,721 --> 00:59:03,870
by Thanksgiving the first semester and 
they get so damn far behind,

1162
00:59:03,871 --> 00:59:04,704
they can't believe it.
Cause there's a lot of work in 

1163
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,840
university,
a lot of reading,

1164
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,240
and then they bail out.
Don't make that mistake,

1165
00:59:09,241 --> 00:59:10,350
man.
It's like,

1166
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:14,730
it's a full time job.
And then you can go have fun at night,

1167
00:59:14,731 --> 00:59:15,930
you know,
and more power to you.

1168
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:16,793
Go have fun,
figure out what your responsibilities 

1169
00:59:19,981 --> 00:59:20,814
are,
lay them out and make a plan and then 

1170
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:25,100
stay on top of them.
And then you know,

1171
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:26,810
you'll,
you'll do yourself a great favor.

1172
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,070
So.
Okay.

1173
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:29,523
Um,

1174
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:37,430
with the majority of your audience being
men,

1175
00:59:37,431 --> 00:59:38,264
how would you characterize the few women
that are generally interested in your 

1176
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:41,234
videos?
Does it mean their masculine side might 

1177
00:59:42,321 --> 00:59:43,154
be preeminent?
I don't know the answer to that mean 

1178
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:50,150
it's the thing,
it's tough one because it turns out that

1179
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:55,151
my primary audiences on youtube and 
youtube seems to be a place that's where

1180
00:59:55,791 --> 00:59:58,040
men are hanging out more than women.
Now.

1181
00:59:58,190 --> 00:59:59,023
I don't know why that is.
It might be because men are slightly 

1182
01:00:04,281 --> 01:00:05,114
more interested in nonfiction and in 
ideas per se than women who are more 

1183
01:00:09,831 --> 01:00:10,664
interested in is fedex and fiction.
That's how what the personality data 

1184
01:00:13,431 --> 01:00:14,264
reveals.
And so it might be that because youtube 

1185
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:18,140
is,
has kind of an emphasis on,

1186
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:23,890
on ideas per se and non fiction ideas 
that men more gravitate towards it.

1187
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,870
Although that is against,
believe me,

1188
01:00:26,871 --> 01:00:29,260
cause I don't really understand it.
Um,

1189
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:33,710
are the women who are watching me more 
masculine in their orientation?

1190
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:37,040
It's possible.
It's possible.

1191
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:38,750
Okay.

1192
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:39,583
I'm not,
so it's not self evident to me why that 

1193
01:00:41,691 --> 01:00:42,524
should be the case though,
because I also spend a lot of time 

1194
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:45,703
talking about symbolic issues and,
and aesthetics would you think would be 

1195
01:00:49,251 --> 01:00:50,084
attractive to women.
So I actually don't know the answer to 

1196
01:00:51,441 --> 01:00:52,670
that.
So,

1197
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,293
um,
what should I do if every time I 

1198
01:00:56,121 --> 01:00:56,954
voluntarily confront my problems,
I get too overwhelmed with stress to 

1199
01:00:59,061 --> 01:01:00,950
make progress solving them.
Ah,

1200
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:02,060
that's a good one,
man.

1201
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:03,103
Okay.
So the first thing is take your 

1202
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:05,600
problems.
Like let's say that,

1203
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,530
let's take the driving example.
I'm too afraid to drive.

1204
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:11,060
Okay.
Then you think,

1205
01:01:11,061 --> 01:01:13,370
well,
what exactly does driving consist of?

1206
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,020
Well,
the first thing is,

1207
01:01:15,021 --> 01:01:18,080
is that you have to establish some kind 
of relationship with a car.

1208
01:01:18,081 --> 01:01:18,950
So you might think,
well,

1209
01:01:18,951 --> 01:01:23,210
you're not too afraid to go online and 
do a little investigation into what cars

1210
01:01:23,211 --> 01:01:24,044
are like,
like what's a good car and how do they 

1211
01:01:25,731 --> 01:01:26,180
work?

1212
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,013
And you know,
the familiarize yourself with the car 

1213
01:01:29,511 --> 01:01:31,580
and then that makes you less afraid.
And then you think,

1214
01:01:31,581 --> 01:01:32,414
well maybe I'll just go sit out in the 
car and put my hands on the steering 

1215
01:01:35,301 --> 01:01:36,134
wheel.
And you don't just kind of accustomed 

1216
01:01:37,371 --> 01:01:38,204
myself to the idea of being in the car 
and a customize accustom myself in my 

1217
01:01:42,171 --> 01:01:43,004
imagination.
Drive around in the car and maybe I'll 

1218
01:01:44,691 --> 01:01:47,810
try some driving simulators online.
And then,

1219
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:49,123
then the next thing is,
well maybe I can find someone I can 

1220
01:01:50,691 --> 01:01:52,400
trust to train me.
And what we'll do is,

1221
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:53,293
as I mentioned earlier,
is we'll go out to an empty parking lot 

1222
01:01:54,861 --> 01:01:59,480
on a Sunday morning and I'll drive 15 
feet and then stop.

1223
01:01:59,481 --> 01:02:00,314
And that'll be good enough for the day.
So what you want to do if you're 

1224
01:02:02,871 --> 01:02:03,704
overwhelmed with your problems is you 
want to break the problems down and you 

1225
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,770
and you do this by thinking 
strategically.

1226
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:10,603
You want to break the problems down into
units that are small enough so that you 

1227
01:02:14,781 --> 01:02:18,740
can confront them and master them with a
high degree of probability.

1228
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,380
And you know,
you can decompose almost every stressful

1229
01:02:22,381 --> 01:02:23,214
problem into.
So imagine that you have a stack of 

1230
01:02:25,231 --> 01:02:26,064
paper on your desk and there's a bunch 
of monsters inside it that you don't 

1231
01:02:27,991 --> 01:02:28,920
want to face.
You know,

1232
01:02:28,921 --> 01:02:32,790
like homework you haven't done or taxes 
that you haven't finished your or,

1233
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:33,624
or you know,
trouble you're having with a 

1234
01:02:35,191 --> 01:02:37,530
bureaucratic enterprise that you'd 
rather avoid.

1235
01:02:37,531 --> 01:02:40,890
It's like one of the things you can do 
is just the first day you might think,

1236
01:02:40,891 --> 01:02:43,290
okay Jesus,
I want to avoid that.

1237
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:44,453
All right,
well would I be willing to take the 

1238
01:02:46,651 --> 01:02:47,484
papers downstairs and put them on the 
table and spend no more than 10 minutes 

1239
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:55,490
just looking at them and organizing them
and you might add then you ask yourself,

1240
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:56,460
what would I do that?

1241
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,080
And if the answer is yes,
you think,

1242
01:02:58,081 --> 01:02:59,700
okay,
that'll be good enough for today.

1243
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:02,550
And then the thing is,
you've knocked on the dragon store,

1244
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:03,690
you know,
and,

1245
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:04,710
and you've,
you've,

1246
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:05,550
you've,
you've,

1247
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:06,383
you've,
you've eliminated the first part of the 

1248
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:09,534
avoidance.
And so then you're on your way and the 

1249
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,360
next day you might think,
well,

1250
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:14,730
you know,
could I deal with the first page of that

1251
01:03:14,731 --> 01:03:16,290
problem?
And you think,

1252
01:03:16,291 --> 01:03:17,820
wow,
I could at least look at it.

1253
01:03:17,821 --> 01:03:18,654
And the trick is,
and this was what behavioral 

1254
01:03:19,981 --> 01:03:23,550
psychologists do all the time,
is identify the fear,

1255
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:25,343
break it down into its sub components,
lay out a schedule for confronting the 

1256
01:03:28,591 --> 01:03:32,070
sub components and don't burden yourself
more than you can tolerate.

1257
01:03:32,071 --> 01:03:32,904
And Man,
you can make unbelievable progress that 

1258
01:03:34,501 --> 01:03:35,580
way.
But you know,

1259
01:03:35,581 --> 01:03:39,360
you have to be willing to give yourself 
credit for small achievements.

1260
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:44,690
And that's fine because consistent small
achievements add up incrementally across

1261
01:03:45,241 --> 01:03:48,690
time into absolutely remarkable progress
because it's,

1262
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:49,850
it starts to,
uh,

1263
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,890
you start to get like compound interest 
in it on it.

1264
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:53,820
So,
yeah,

1265
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:55,140
so that's what you should do.
And look,

1266
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:56,243
if that doesn't work and you're so 
overwhelmed that you're just absolutely 

1267
01:03:58,951 --> 01:03:59,784
in spaces,
then one of the things that you should 

1268
01:04:01,411 --> 01:04:03,840
consider is that maybe you have an 
anxiety disorder,

1269
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:04,674
maybe you're depressed.
Like maybe things have just really 

1270
01:04:06,451 --> 01:04:09,150
collapsed in on you and you have 
terrible problems.

1271
01:04:09,151 --> 01:04:09,840
Like,
you know,

1272
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:10,673
maybe you're sick and you're,
you have an ill relative and you're in 

1273
01:04:14,251 --> 01:04:16,290
real financial trouble and you're 
unemployed.

1274
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,910
It's like,
that's just too much.

1275
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:20,490
And so at that point,
maybe you need to go talk to someone and

1276
01:04:20,491 --> 01:04:24,060
maybe you need to consider something 
like temporary antianxiety medication or

1277
01:04:24,061 --> 01:04:24,894
antidepressant medication and to sit 
down and strategize with someone about 

1278
01:04:28,621 --> 01:04:30,330
how you're going to put your life back 
on track.

1279
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,283
And I would say also,
if you're in a situation like that and 

1280
01:04:33,901 --> 01:04:35,100
you can't find a,

1281
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:36,670
okay,

1282
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:37,503
you can't find a therapist,
then try the self authoring program 

1283
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:42,280
because that's what we designed it for.
So,

1284
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,050
okay,
another live one.

1285
01:04:44,051 --> 01:04:44,884
Let's see here.

1286
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:46,610
MMM.

1287
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:59,460
I saw someone called the green bastard.
I wanted to answer that question,

1288
01:04:59,461 --> 01:05:00,294
but it flashed by real quick.
So is that a reference to bubbles' 

1289
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:04,880
wrestling persona?
Uh,

1290
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:08,370
just out of curiosity,
I'm wondering if you're a fellow trailer

1291
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:10,470
park boys fan because I,
you know,

1292
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,950
I love the trailer park boys and,
and uh,

1293
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:16,290
because of my western Canadian 
upbringing I suppose.

1294
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:17,350
And,
um,

1295
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,300
so,
but I missed your question,

1296
01:05:19,301 --> 01:05:20,320
but I like your,
uh,

1297
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:21,250
your handle,
so,

1298
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,084
okay.
Let's see.

1299
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,250
Oh,
Mohammed had,

1300
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:32,730
how do you says re Islam?
Can I send you names of us Canadians,

1301
01:05:32,731 --> 01:05:36,220
scholars who are grounded in western 
culture and traditional Islam?

1302
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:38,620
You should reach out to them before I 
entered her z.

1303
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:39,820
Do sure.
Do it,

1304
01:05:39,821 --> 01:05:40,654
man.
Send it Jordan Dot Peterson at U 

1305
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:42,881
Toronto.
Dot.

1306
01:05:42,881 --> 01:05:45,700
Ca.
I already talked to I and Hirsi Ali,

1307
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:48,370
by the way,
and I'm going to post my discussion with

1308
01:05:48,371 --> 01:05:50,080
her very soon,
but I am,

1309
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:52,300
I'm interested in,
um,

1310
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,870
engaging in as broad a series of 
dialogues as possible.

1311
01:05:55,871 --> 01:05:56,704
And so if you've got some people you 
think are good and articulate and 

1312
01:05:59,171 --> 01:06:00,190
willing to talk,
man,

1313
01:06:00,191 --> 01:06:01,120
yeah,
send their names.

1314
01:06:01,121 --> 01:06:03,430
Okay.
Jordan Dot Peterson at U Toronto.

1315
01:06:03,431 --> 01:06:04,264
Dot.
Ca.

1316
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,670
Um,
let's see.

1317
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,633
Dr. Peterson.
I was wondering if you have any advice 

1318
01:06:10,121 --> 01:06:13,750
for figuring out whether vengeance is 
ever a good thing or is it always bad?

1319
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:15,373
Oh,

1320
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,740
that's a good one,
man.

1321
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:19,343
Look,
I have clients very frequently who have 

1322
01:06:20,791 --> 01:06:21,624
been seriously wronged by someone in 
their life and maybe the wrong doing is 

1323
01:06:25,711 --> 01:06:26,544
ongoing and so like they're often 
possessed by the desire for revenge 

1324
01:06:29,881 --> 01:06:32,190
sometimes to homicide levels.
Okay.

1325
01:06:32,191 --> 01:06:35,970
So then you got to think about that 
really carefully because you know,

1326
01:06:35,971 --> 01:06:36,720
you say,
well,

1327
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,280
you should forgive people.
It's like,

1328
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:41,000
well
no,

1329
01:06:41,001 --> 01:06:42,830
you should forgive people that repent.

1330
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:44,070
Yeah.

1331
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:44,903
And you should forgive people because be
carrying the burden of the demand for 

1332
01:06:49,051 --> 01:06:49,884
vengeance with you and being resentful 
about that is really hard on you and it 

1333
01:06:54,721 --> 01:06:55,554
can cripple you.
And so it's not a great move 

1334
01:06:56,851 --> 01:06:59,400
psychologically.
But having said that,

1335
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:01,470
like it's not easy to distinguish the 
demand,

1336
01:07:01,530 --> 01:07:04,170
the desire for vengeance from the desire
for justice.

1337
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,273
And part of the reason that we have a 
justice system is so that you can 

1338
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,980
outsource your desire for vengeance to 
assist them.

1339
01:07:10,981 --> 01:07:14,490
That alleviates your moral 
responsibility for,

1340
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:15,450
okay,

1341
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:17,550
going head to head with someone that's 
wrong.

1342
01:07:17,551 --> 01:07:18,384
Do you?
So it's a really complicated question 

1343
01:07:20,551 --> 01:07:24,480
and I would say,
I can't answer it on a generic level.

1344
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:28,020
I'd have to say it depends on the 
particulars of your situation.

1345
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,153
But vengeance,
the problem with vengeance generally 

1346
01:07:30,991 --> 01:07:32,640
speaking,
is that it produces

1347
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:33,973
mmm

1348
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,530
feuds.
Like it spirals out of control.

1349
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:38,940
You know,
I hit you,

1350
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:41,370
you hit me twice,
I hate you four times,

1351
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:42,860
you stab me,
you know,

1352
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,150
I kill your brother,
you killed my family,

1353
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,370
you know,
and then soon the whole world's at war.

1354
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:48,773
And it's something,
I think that the story of Cain and Abel 

1355
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:52,223
really

1356
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:52,990
okay

1357
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:53,823
warns against.
And I think part of the reason that we 

1358
01:07:55,391 --> 01:07:56,224
have a justice system is actually to 
stop people from taking vengeance on 

1359
01:07:59,321 --> 01:08:02,020
each other.
So you know the demand.

1360
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:05,020
You remember years ago,
Michael Mactac to Cactus,

1361
01:08:05,021 --> 01:08:07,000
I think that was his name.
He ran for president.

1362
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:07,863
And one of the things he did that was 
really wrong is that when he was 

1363
01:08:10,271 --> 01:08:12,520
governor of Massachusetts,
he released this guy,

1364
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:15,010
I think his name was willy,
if I remember correctly.

1365
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,820
And once he was released,
he went out,

1366
01:08:16,821 --> 01:08:17,790
raped someone.
If,

1367
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:20,570
if I've got the story right and Dukakis 
was asked,

1368
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:22,940
asked on national TV,
you know,

1369
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,980
how,
how he would respond,

1370
01:08:25,030 --> 01:08:27,170
something like that if someone had raped
his wife,

1371
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,330
like someone who was released,
had raped his wife,

1372
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,193
you know,
and the right response to that question 

1373
01:08:32,481 --> 01:08:33,261
is,
you know,

1374
01:08:33,261 --> 01:08:35,300
I'd like to rip the guy's lungs out and 
you know,

1375
01:08:35,301 --> 01:08:38,030
maybe I'd stalk his house until I had 
the opportunity to do that.

1376
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:42,860
That's what I would want to do.
But because I'm a civilized person and I

1377
01:08:42,861 --> 01:08:43,694
understand the danger of that,
I would cooperate with the justice 

1378
01:08:46,701 --> 01:08:47,534
system and do everything I could to 
ensure that the person was brought to 

1379
01:08:49,641 --> 01:08:52,790
justice.
And then I would do my best to reconcile

1380
01:08:52,791 --> 01:08:53,624
myself without outcome,
even though every cell in my body would 

1381
01:08:56,151 --> 01:08:58,790
be crying out for vengeance.
That's the right answer.

1382
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:00,590
But,
well,

1383
01:09:00,591 --> 01:09:02,690
so I'll leave that,
the answer to that.

1384
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,610
Um,
I'll leave.

1385
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,320
I'll leave it at that.
So

1386
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:09,343
yeah.
Yeah.

1387
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:11,090
Okay.
Let's see.

1388
01:09:11,091 --> 01:09:14,270
Um,
I'd like to take good big five test.

1389
01:09:14,271 --> 01:09:15,104
I've noticed there are many online.
Where can I find the most accurate test 

1390
01:09:17,421 --> 01:09:18,201
to take?
Well,

1391
01:09:18,201 --> 01:09:19,034
I would say wait three weeks or a month 
because we're going to release our 

1392
01:09:21,681 --> 01:09:25,060
version of the big five aspect scale,
which is a scale that,

1393
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:26,023
that,
that a student of mine called the young 

1394
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:29,810
developed while he was working in my 
lab.

1395
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:31,220
And,
um,

1396
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,850
it was partly generated by an idea that 
I had with,

1397
01:09:34,851 --> 01:09:35,900
uh,
another,

1398
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,270
my business partner I mentioned earlier,
Daniel Higgins.

1399
01:09:38,271 --> 01:09:39,104
Cause we had talked for years about the 
necessity of developing a more 

1400
01:09:42,981 --> 01:09:46,250
differentiated higher resolution version
of the big five,

1401
01:09:46,251 --> 01:09:48,530
which had been attempted by the people 
who,

1402
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:49,490
who,
uh,

1403
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:52,040
develop the neo pir,
which has a,

1404
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:53,900
which has,
what did they call them?

1405
01:09:53,901 --> 01:09:56,090
Facets,
but they weren't empirically derived.

1406
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:57,163
So if you wait a month,
you'd be able to take the big five 

1407
01:09:58,401 --> 01:10:02,420
aspects scale test and it would give you
10 dimensions of personality output.

1408
01:10:02,421 --> 01:10:04,730
And I think it's a,
it's a really good test.

1409
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:05,713
We've used it a lot and it's being used 
very widely in the relevant scientific 

1410
01:10:09,231 --> 01:10:11,450
domains.
The papers be very highly cited.

1411
01:10:11,451 --> 01:10:14,360
I think it's been cited like 600 times 
or something like that.

1412
01:10:14,361 --> 01:10:15,600
So,
so,

1413
01:10:15,601 --> 01:10:16,434
um,
keep an eye out and that should be 

1414
01:10:18,921 --> 01:10:19,754
coming real soon.

1415
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,073
So if psychedelics increase openness and
openness is correlated with 

1416
01:10:24,111 --> 01:10:26,780
intelligence,
can psychedelics increase intelligence?

1417
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,670
Good question.
I doubt it.

1418
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:29,743
Most things don't increase fluid 
intelligence really hard to get an 

1419
01:10:32,451 --> 01:10:34,610
increase in fluid intelligence.
Um,

1420
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:35,593
you know,
those brain training games like 

1421
01:10:36,711 --> 01:10:38,480
lumosity,
um,

1422
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:39,943
even if you play a lot of those games 
and they're very complex cognitive 

1423
01:10:43,071 --> 01:10:46,670
games,
you don't tend to experience an increase

1424
01:10:46,671 --> 01:10:47,504
in general intelligence.
You get better at each game domain 

1425
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:53,360
specifically,
but it doesn't seem to generalize across

1426
01:10:53,361 --> 01:10:55,550
intelligence per se.
So,

1427
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,033
um,
I doubt that psychedelics increase 

1428
01:10:58,911 --> 01:11:02,240
intelligence and openness,
the personality dimension.

1429
01:11:05,570 --> 01:11:08,330
See,
it's a good question because it might be

1430
01:11:08,331 --> 01:11:09,164
that psychedelic use would increase 
something like divergent thinking 

1431
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,240
associated with like the torrance tests 
of creativity.

1432
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,430
But I don't think anybody's ever tested 
that.

1433
01:11:17,431 --> 01:11:19,800
And you could consider that a form of 
intelligence,

1434
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:22,470
but I think the probability that it 
would increase,

1435
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:25,140
um,
nonverbal intelligence is low.

1436
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,033
MMM.

1437
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,033
And that's partly because there are 
elements to openness that aren't 

1438
01:11:31,171 --> 01:11:35,200
reducible to psychometric intelligence.
So I doubt it.

1439
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:36,643
It would be wonderful if we could find 
something that would increase 

1440
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:38,964
intelligence,
but that's turned out to be something 

1441
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,050
unbelievably difficult.
Um,

1442
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,193
okay.
To what extent do you believe that 

1443
01:11:44,221 --> 01:11:45,054
discourse with moderate Muslims can lead
to reform of the ideology such that the 

1444
01:11:48,961 --> 01:11:51,690
gap between Islamic and Western beliefs 
can be bridged?

1445
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:52,733
Well,
I guess we're going to find out about 

1446
01:11:53,821 --> 01:11:54,654
that because that's one of the things I 
want to do over the next couple of 

1447
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:57,653
years.
Um,

1448
01:11:57,810 --> 01:11:58,650
it's,
you know,

1449
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,310
I said this before,
um,

1450
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:05,070
but I think it's worth saying again,
as far as I can tell,

1451
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:08,040
there's only three states of being there
is tyranny,

1452
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:12,390
there's slavery and there's negotiation 
and you know,

1453
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:15,120
tyranny,
tyranny and slavery are forms of war.

1454
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:20,130
So we either enter into discourse and 
hopefully with the moderate Muslims or

1455
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:21,410
yeah,

1456
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:24,400
where are the tyrants or they're the 
tyrants and we're the slaves,

1457
01:12:24,401 --> 01:12:26,590
or they're the slaves.
And then there's war.

1458
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:27,633
And so we bloody well better have 
discourse because war is what happens 

1459
01:12:30,821 --> 01:12:33,580
when discourse fails.
And you know,

1460
01:12:33,730 --> 01:12:35,710
we actually,
in some ways,

1461
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:41,220
we can't really go to war anymore 
because we're so armed.

1462
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:44,200
And increasingly that's also the case in
the Muslim world.

1463
01:12:44,201 --> 01:12:45,230
I mean,
look at Pakistan,

1464
01:12:45,231 --> 01:12:46,064
it's,
it's developing a pretty decent nuclear 

1465
01:12:47,081 --> 01:12:48,070
arm.
Our movement,

1466
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:49,083
I'm nuclear a deterrent let's say,
which is quite terrifying because 

1467
01:12:52,391 --> 01:12:55,420
Pakistan is one unstable and dangerous 
place.

1468
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:57,400
But I mean,
what are you going to do?

1469
01:12:57,430 --> 01:12:59,740
You're going to go to war with people 
who have hydrogen bombs.

1470
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:01,360
It's like,
that's not gonna work out very well.

1471
01:13:01,361 --> 01:13:04,660
So we bloody well better learn to talk.
And so I'm hoping,

1472
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:06,760
you know,
I'm doing this biblical series,

1473
01:13:06,761 --> 01:13:07,594
which some of you may be no about 
because you're also helping to ensure 

1474
01:13:10,781 --> 01:13:11,980
that it happened.
And again,

1475
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:14,290
thank you very much.
But in parallel without,

1476
01:13:14,291 --> 01:13:15,124
I'm doing,
I want to do a very long series of 

1477
01:13:16,691 --> 01:13:20,260
discussions with moderate Muslims,
theological,

1478
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:22,210
philosophical,
political,

1479
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:23,223
practical to see if the gap between 
Islamic and western beliefs can be 

1480
01:13:26,981 --> 01:13:27,814
bridged.
I better be able to be bridged because 

1481
01:13:29,441 --> 01:13:30,820
we're all on the same planet,
man.

1482
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,920
And there's lots of both of us.
So,

1483
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:34,013
um,
capitulation on either side isn't going 

1484
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:36,460
to work and,

1485
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:41,330
and like blind ignorance of the,
of the dangers,

1486
01:13:41,331 --> 01:13:43,880
mutual dangers that our society's post 
to one another.

1487
01:13:43,881 --> 01:13:46,880
I mean,
I mean by that I mean,

1488
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:49,400
you know,
to the degree that Islam,

1489
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:53,300
Islamic societies are functional 
traditional societies,

1490
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:54,613
they're threatened in that functional 
traditionalism by radical western 

1491
01:13:59,330 --> 01:14:01,640
technological and philosophical 
revolution,

1492
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:02,503
just like worth threatened as Westerners
ourselves by our own technological and 

1493
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:11,240
philosophical,
revolutionary nature discourse,

1494
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:12,250
truthful

1495
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,300
discourse,
man.

1496
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:15,670
That's,
that's the hope for the salvation of the

1497
01:14:15,671 --> 01:14:16,504
world.
And so hopefully we'll put it into 

1498
01:14:17,951 --> 01:14:18,784
practice.
I've,

1499
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:19,773
I've met a number of moderate Muslims 
already in Canada who are extremely 

1500
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:24,760
interested in this sort of thing and 
some in the u s as well.

1501
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:27,250
And so I think that,
well,

1502
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,380
you know,
it's worth a try,

1503
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:30,670
man.
So,

1504
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:32,530
okay,
another live one

1505
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:40,090
just tuned in says logic bombs.
How many times should I clean my room?

1506
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:45,130
Clean your room until when you go in 
there,

1507
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:47,230
you start doing things that are good for
you.

1508
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:51,670
So because cleaning it isn't just isn't 
just organ,

1509
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:54,310
it's not just making sure that it's not 
messy man.

1510
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:59,520
It's organizing it so that it's a place 
where you're being can properly manifest

1511
01:14:59,771 --> 01:15:00,604
itself.
It's a place that should invite you to 

1512
01:15:01,961 --> 01:15:02,794
do the things that are good for you in 
the world and show you should be 

1513
01:15:05,051 --> 01:15:08,200
thinking when you have a room.
If you're fortunate and I have to have a

1514
01:15:08,201 --> 01:15:08,711
room,
you think,

1515
01:15:08,711 --> 01:15:11,560
okay,
I want to organize this room so that the

1516
01:15:11,561 --> 01:15:12,394
probability that all do the things that 
I know I should do as maximumly 

1517
01:15:15,311 --> 01:15:16,240
heightened,
you know,

1518
01:15:16,241 --> 01:15:18,520
get yourself good desk.
If you need a desk,

1519
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,473
get yourself a good bed that you liked,
like set the bloody place up so that 

1520
01:15:22,121 --> 01:15:23,260
when you walk in there,
you think,

1521
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:24,183
Jesus,
a civilized human being could really 

1522
01:15:25,151 --> 01:15:25,984
live in here.

1523
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,390
And then every time you walk in there,
your room,

1524
01:15:28,391 --> 01:15:29,224
we'll remind you that the proper way to 
behave in there is to behave as a 

1525
01:15:31,691 --> 01:15:33,850
civilized,
being responsible,

1526
01:15:33,851 --> 01:15:35,230
intelligent,
forward looking,

1527
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:36,550
articulate,
you know,

1528
01:15:36,551 --> 01:15:37,384
concerned about doing what's good in,
in the most courageous and and 

1529
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:42,910
responsible possible way.
You know,

1530
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:43,793
not as a two bit do gooder,
who's looked trying to look good in 

1531
01:15:45,731 --> 01:15:48,190
front of the world,
but as someone who's tough and,

1532
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:50,140
and,
and able and,

1533
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:53,560
and,
and caring and reliable and all of that,

1534
01:15:53,561 --> 01:15:55,000
and that's what your room should tell 
you.

1535
01:15:55,001 --> 01:15:55,834
So set the damn thing up until that's 
what it screams at you when you walk in 

1536
01:15:58,781 --> 01:15:59,980
there.
So,

1537
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:05,620
okay,
what is my Iq?

1538
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:09,660
Less than it used to be because it 
declines as you age,

1539
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:11,070
you know,
quite a lot.

1540
01:16:11,071 --> 01:16:15,060
So you start getting stupider from an Iq
perspective at about 22 or 23.

1541
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:16,343
So,
and the best way to regulate that is to 

1542
01:16:17,821 --> 01:16:20,640
engage in physical exercise.
Just so you all know.

1543
01:16:20,670 --> 01:16:21,870
So,
um,

1544
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:23,003
both weightlifting and cardiovascular 
exercise are really good for the 

1545
01:16:25,231 --> 01:16:27,290
maintenance of intelligence.
Um,

1546
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:29,280
I don't know what my Iq is.
I,

1547
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,320
I had it tested at one point.

1548
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:32,493
MMM.

1549
01:16:33,910 --> 01:16:34,743
It's in excess of 150,
but I don't know exactly where it lands 

1550
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,433
now.
I should,

1551
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,660
I should,
uh,

1552
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:43,390
what qualify that to some degree,
you know,

1553
01:16:43,930 --> 01:16:44,763
as your intelligence increases,
the scatter between the different 

1554
01:16:47,621 --> 01:16:51,640
subtypes of intelligence such as there 
are increases.

1555
01:16:51,641 --> 01:16:55,510
So you might say that there's only one 
way to be stupid,

1556
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:56,553
but there's many ways to be intelligent.
And so I'm not overwhelmingly 

1557
01:17:01,001 --> 01:17:03,580
intelligent from a quantitative 
perspective.

1558
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:04,833
You know,
I think my gre scores for on the 

1559
01:17:07,061 --> 01:17:08,420
quantitative,
uh,

1560
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:11,120
end of things for about 70,
75th percentile,

1561
01:17:11,121 --> 01:17:13,250
which isn't too bad given that,
you know,

1562
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:16,010
you're competing against other people 
who were going into graduate school,

1563
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:19,990
but there's a big difference between 
75th percentile and 99th percentile.

1564
01:17:19,991 --> 01:17:21,560
And I think that's where it was 
verbally,

1565
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:23,540
something like that.
Um,

1566
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:28,850
so I can certainly see that I have gaps 
in my intelligence when it,

1567
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:31,340
when I'm discussing things with people 
who have real,

1568
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:33,380
who are really quantitatively brilliant.

1569
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:34,243
My business partner,
Daniel Higgins is quantitatively 

1570
01:17:35,841 --> 01:17:37,020
brilliant.
Um,

1571
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:38,990
I've got an edge on a verbally,
but,

1572
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,660
but he's definitely got an edge on me 
quantitatively.

1573
01:17:41,661 --> 01:17:44,600
And I've had students like that too,
who like could pick up statistics.

1574
01:17:44,601 --> 01:17:47,870
I had one student who was little on the 
artistic side that,

1575
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:51,170
that she is a woman man,
not woman.

1576
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:54,260
She was so damn smart sheet.
She learned how to write,

1577
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:56,210
moved from,
you know,

1578
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,880
credible writer to an excellent writer 
and about four months,

1579
01:17:58,881 --> 01:17:59,714
which was stellar.
And she moved from not knowing a damn 

1580
01:18:01,071 --> 01:18:01,904
thing about statistics to being able to 
teach it to Harvard undergraduates had 

1581
01:18:04,431 --> 01:18:08,540
an award winning level within a year.
It's like that just made my jaw drop.

1582
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:09,673
Now she had a hell of a time presenting 
herself properly in public when she was 

1583
01:18:12,231 --> 01:18:13,790
doing public presentations.
So,

1584
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,830
you know,
she had other gaps in her ability.

1585
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:18,170
But um,
you know,

1586
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:20,023
I can hold my own verbally and I'm 
rarely in a situation where I feel like 

1587
01:18:23,241 --> 01:18:24,074
I'm at a disadvantage verbally,
but that's certainly not the case 

1588
01:18:26,721 --> 01:18:27,554
quantitatively.
I feel at a disadvantage very 

1589
01:18:28,971 --> 01:18:30,410
frequently,
quantitatively.

1590
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:32,350
So,
um,

1591
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,950
I would love to hear you do a lecture 
series on raising children properly.

1592
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:39,620
Is that something you would consider?
Um,

1593
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:41,340
yeah.
Um,

1594
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:42,860
we'll see.
You know,

1595
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:44,173
I'm really curious to see what sort of 
response this book I'm going to publish 

1596
01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:49,550
gets,
especially this chapter on,

1597
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:52,280
don't let your children do anything that
makes you dislike them.

1598
01:18:52,281 --> 01:18:53,114
Because in some sense I would say that 
the propositions I put forth aren't 

1599
01:18:57,110 --> 01:18:59,840
exactly what you would normally here,
surprise,

1600
01:18:59,841 --> 01:19:00,674
surprise in,
in the cultural milieu that surrounds 

1601
01:19:02,751 --> 01:19:03,584
children right now because everybody and
their dog is afraid of disciplining 

1602
01:19:06,201 --> 01:19:08,060
children.
And that's really stupid because,

1603
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:09,951
yeah,
stupid.

1604
01:19:09,951 --> 01:19:11,090
His rights,
the right word.

1605
01:19:11,390 --> 01:19:12,223
Because undisciplined children are 
terrified and the reason they're 

1606
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:19,580
terrified as they,
sorry.

1607
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:20,423
Gotta change the battery.

1608
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:23,443
Yeah.

1609
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:35,360
And
hopefully we're back.

1610
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:37,613
Let's see.

1611
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,370
Okay.
Um,

1612
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:50,233
Mr Cuban says,
why is it so important to have kids if 

1613
01:20:52,371 --> 01:20:54,920
the world has an overpopulation problem?
Well,

1614
01:20:54,921 --> 01:20:57,020
who says the world has an overpopulation
problem?

1615
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:58,573
I don't buy that.
So it depends on whether you think that 

1616
01:21:01,310 --> 01:21:02,143
human brains are the kind of resource 
that figures out how to do more with 

1617
01:21:05,301 --> 01:21:06,920
less.
And that is what I think.

1618
01:21:06,921 --> 01:21:07,754
I mean,
there's been a huge argument for years 

1619
01:21:08,751 --> 01:21:11,150
between the economists and the 
biologists.

1620
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:14,150
You know,
the biologists often the pessimistic and

1621
01:21:14,151 --> 01:21:17,000
they basically adopt a Malthusian 
perspective.

1622
01:21:17,001 --> 01:21:17,834
And that is that we'll continue to breed
until we exhaust the planet and doing 

1623
01:21:21,801 --> 01:21:24,020
our,
all of our resources.

1624
01:21:24,021 --> 01:21:25,970
And the economists always counter that 
by saying,

1625
01:21:25,971 --> 01:21:26,804
hey,
don't be forgetting that we can 

1626
01:21:28,461 --> 01:21:30,500
constantly figure out how to do more 
with less than that.

1627
01:21:30,501 --> 01:21:33,860
We're pretty damn smart and I'm afraid 
I'm on the side of the economists,

1628
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:36,140
but even more to the point,
you know,

1629
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:37,453
the projections right now indicate that 
we'll probably peak somewhere around 

1630
01:21:39,891 --> 01:21:40,724
nine or 10 billion something sometimes 
by the middle of the 21st century and 

1631
01:21:44,031 --> 01:21:46,730
then our population will start to 
decline pretty precipitously.

1632
01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:49,310
And I think there's every reason to 
assume,

1633
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:50,173
especially at our current rate of 
technological progress progression and 

1634
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:57,710
our increasing willingness to take 
broader responsibility for the,

1635
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:01,430
for the large scale health of the planet
that will be able to manage that without

1636
01:22:01,431 --> 01:22:02,264
too much problem.
We can certainly grow enough food to do 

1637
01:22:03,651 --> 01:22:04,484
it.
If we put a little bit of effort into 

1638
01:22:05,241 --> 01:22:06,330
that,
um,

1639
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:08,960
we're going to squeeze out a lot of 
other animals on the way,

1640
01:22:08,961 --> 01:22:09,794
I'm afraid,
especially some of the big predators 

1641
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:12,113
and,
and mammals that are of approximately 

1642
01:22:13,401 --> 01:22:14,660
our size.
And that's,

1643
01:22:14,661 --> 01:22:15,890
you know,
there's,

1644
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:16,773
there's a price to be paid for that.
I think there's more tigers now in 

1645
01:22:18,741 --> 01:22:21,460
Texas,
just in case you're wondering the reason

1646
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:23,840
the wild and the rest of the world.
And so,

1647
01:22:23,841 --> 01:22:24,531
but,
you know,

1648
01:22:24,531 --> 01:22:27,740
tigers tend to eat children and so it's 
kind of rough having them around.

1649
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:28,963
But in any case,
I'm not worried that we're going to 

1650
01:22:31,371 --> 01:22:33,290
overpopulate the planet and,
and,

1651
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:35,150
and,
and destroy everything.

1652
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:36,073
And I think that that's thinking that 
basically hasn't advanced since the 

1653
01:22:38,541 --> 01:22:40,880
1960s because,
um,

1654
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:42,373
we are making tremendous progress in,
in pulling people out of the lower 

1655
01:22:46,191 --> 01:22:47,024
echelons of poverty.
And there's a lot of terrible resource 

1656
01:22:49,371 --> 01:22:52,460
misused at the lower echelons of the 
poverty distribution.

1657
01:22:52,461 --> 01:22:55,330
So for example,
when people have to cook with wood,

1658
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:57,350
um,
you know,

1659
01:22:57,410 --> 01:23:00,200
that that produces a tremendous amount 
of deforestation,

1660
01:23:00,201 --> 01:23:01,700
for example,
and that kind of thing.

1661
01:23:01,701 --> 01:23:02,750
And,
um,

1662
01:23:02,930 --> 01:23:06,460
I think we'll get her act together if 
we're fortunate peak around 9 billion.

1663
01:23:06,461 --> 01:23:07,294
The,
that we'll,

1664
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:10,960
we'll be worrying about deep population 
by the time some of the young,

1665
01:23:11,130 --> 01:23:13,450
younger people are old.
Um,

1666
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:18,580
and besides you have kids cause that's 
part of life.

1667
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:20,980
So,
and it's,

1668
01:23:20,981 --> 01:23:21,814
it's the,
the two things aren't related in some 

1669
01:23:23,741 --> 01:23:25,060
sense as far as I'm concerned.

1670
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:29,200
So the trick is to have kids that are 
more good than harm.

1671
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:31,480
You know what I mean?
Because maybe because

1672
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,740
people aren't only consumers,
there are also producers.

1673
01:23:35,890 --> 01:23:38,770
It's kind of appalling that we regard 
ourselves as consumers.

1674
01:23:39,190 --> 01:23:40,750
So you know,
if you're going to have kids,

1675
01:23:40,751 --> 01:23:42,310
have good kids,
make them smart,

1676
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:44,290
make them tough,
help them be tough,

1677
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:46,420
you don't really make them,
help them be tough,

1678
01:23:46,421 --> 01:23:49,510
help them be smart health and be 
responsible and then,

1679
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:51,640
you know,
maybe they'll do good and,

1680
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:56,230
and that'll be good for the world and 
people and like I'm pro people man.

1681
01:23:57,010 --> 01:23:59,890
And so I'm not worried about that.
So,

1682
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:01,270
so,
you know,

1683
01:24:01,271 --> 01:24:02,104
I heard a university professor once who 
I also thought was completely 

1684
01:24:04,751 --> 01:24:05,584
reprehensible,
who was like lecturing to a group of 18 

1685
01:24:08,081 --> 01:24:08,914
year old kids about how he and his wife 
had only decided to have one child 

1686
01:24:11,591 --> 01:24:12,424
because you know,
they didn't want to overpopulate the 

1687
01:24:13,361 --> 01:24:13,720
world.

1688
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:18,280
And I thought that if he'd only managed 
to reproduce one genetic copy of him,

1689
01:24:18,281 --> 01:24:19,114
that was probably for the best.
But then he told the whole room full of 

1690
01:24:21,941 --> 01:24:22,774
18 year olds that they should really 
think seriously about whether they have 

1691
01:24:24,941 --> 01:24:26,890
kids and if they have any,
they should just have one.

1692
01:24:26,891 --> 01:24:28,480
And I thought,
you son of a bitch,

1693
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:29,710
you know,
you're such a,

1694
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:30,693
you're so dedicated to,
to the destruction of humanity and so 

1695
01:24:35,021 --> 01:24:35,854
rife with hatred for the human race that
you dare to stand in front of kids who 

1696
01:24:39,401 --> 01:24:41,830
are just beginning their lives and say,
well you're such a,

1697
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:42,813
you're a member of such a reprehensible 
species that the last thing you should 

1698
01:24:45,071 --> 01:24:46,720
do is multiply.
It's like,

1699
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:47,770
no,
sorry,

1700
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:51,400
I don't see any wisdom in that at all.
And I don't think the world does have an

1701
01:24:51,401 --> 01:24:52,234
overpopulation problem.
And I don't think that there's any 

1702
01:24:53,861 --> 01:24:55,270
evidence that it does now.

1703
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:56,103
That doesn't mean that we're managing 
everything that we should manage 

1704
01:24:58,271 --> 01:24:59,104
property,
like we're really wreaking havoc on the 

1705
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:01,803
oceans,
but Boyan Slat who's definitely worth 

1706
01:25:04,481 --> 01:25:05,710
looking up,
boy on,

1707
01:25:05,711 --> 01:25:10,711
I think it's b o y a n and s l a t Dutch
kid has figured out he thinks how to get

1708
01:25:12,401 --> 01:25:13,234
rid of half the plastic in the oceans in
the next five years so you can go 

1709
01:25:15,641 --> 01:25:17,650
support him.
That'd be a hell of a thing to do.

1710
01:25:17,651 --> 01:25:18,484
He's a real genius and there's lots of 
ways that the burden that we're placing 

1711
01:25:23,171 --> 01:25:27,820
on the our planetary resources is going 
to be lifted and the trick is to get out

1712
01:25:27,821 --> 01:25:29,110
there and do something about it.
You know,

1713
01:25:29,111 --> 01:25:31,450
like Elon Musk is a good example.
It's like,

1714
01:25:31,451 --> 01:25:33,460
okay,
well maybe we're burning too many fossil

1715
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:34,294
fields and maybe not because I think the
dangers of carbon dioxide are actually 

1716
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:40,180
somewhat overstated and I think there's 
some decent evidence for that too.

1717
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:41,433
But it's hard to sort it out because so 
much of the climate change argument is 

1718
01:25:45,191 --> 01:25:49,360
predicated on an underlying philosophy 
such that if you're anticapitalist,

1719
01:25:49,361 --> 01:25:51,130
you believe that we're going to burn up 
the planet.

1720
01:25:51,131 --> 01:25:51,964
And that's just not helpful because I 
can't tell if your science is right or 

1721
01:25:55,001 --> 01:25:57,490
if you're just anti-western an 
anticapitalist.

1722
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:58,593
So,
and like I spent three years working on 

1723
01:26:00,941 --> 01:26:02,830
a UN committee,
uh,

1724
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:07,860
that the Secretary Generals High Level 
Panel on economic sustainability,

1725
01:26:07,941 --> 01:26:08,774
I think it was called and it produced a 
report in 2013 and I spent about three 

1726
01:26:12,111 --> 01:26:14,570
years reading everything I could get my 
hands on,

1727
01:26:14,571 --> 01:26:18,530
on economic development and 
environmental sustainability and the,

1728
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:19,473
the state of the planet is far less 
dismal than the doomsayers would have 

1729
01:26:21,921 --> 01:26:24,710
you believe.
I do think that the one thing that we're

1730
01:26:24,711 --> 01:26:25,544
doing is like,
we're fishing out the oceans like 

1731
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:29,870
idiotically.
It's really,

1732
01:26:29,871 --> 01:26:30,530
really awful.

1733
01:26:30,530 --> 01:26:34,850
And trolling is a,
is a very damaging process.

1734
01:26:34,851 --> 01:26:35,684
And,
and I think that like if we left the 

1735
01:26:37,371 --> 01:26:40,130
damn oceans alone for about 15 years,
they'd recover.

1736
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:41,143
Not The great thought.
The huge fish like tuna because they 

1737
01:26:42,861 --> 01:26:43,694
take a long time to develop.
But oceans would come back really 

1738
01:26:45,231 --> 01:26:47,930
quickly and you know,
but I think we'll get smart enough to do

1739
01:26:47,931 --> 01:26:50,750
that sort of thing over the next 50 
years because you know,

1740
01:26:50,751 --> 01:26:51,584
human beings aren't stupid and we've 
actually only been worried about the 

1741
01:26:53,901 --> 01:26:58,730
planet,
let's say since about 1960 it was only a

1742
01:26:58,730 --> 01:27:01,580
hundred years ago that it was more or 
less self evident that the,

1743
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:02,623
the natural world was inexhaustible in 
comparison to the puny efforts of 

1744
01:27:05,931 --> 01:27:07,940
humanity.
And you know,

1745
01:27:07,941 --> 01:27:08,774
we only figured out that there was 
enough of us to cause trouble by about 

1746
01:27:10,791 --> 01:27:13,880
1960 for Christ's sake.
How long do you expect us to,

1747
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:15,223
how long do you expect it it to take us 
to figure out how to take care of a 

1748
01:27:18,141 --> 01:27:18,974
whole planet?

1749
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,860
You know,
we're doing a pretty good job for people

1750
01:27:21,861 --> 01:27:24,290
who only stumbled onto the idea that 
there might be a problem,

1751
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:27,320
something like 60 years ago.
So I think we'll get it right,

1752
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:28,483
especially if more and more people start
to act responsibly and truthfully and 

1753
01:27:31,491 --> 01:27:33,050
all of that which,
and,

1754
01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:36,290
and start working for the betterment of 
things instead of trying to,

1755
01:27:36,770 --> 01:27:40,040
you know,
undermine and hurt and,

1756
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:40,941
and,
you know,

1757
01:27:40,941 --> 01:27:44,300
engage in identity politics and all that
sort of reprehensible,

1758
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:48,410
reprehensible activity.
Okay.

1759
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:50,173
Let's see.
What are your thoughts on using 

1760
01:27:51,531 --> 01:27:54,470
psychedelics to help people overcome 
traumatic experiences?

1761
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:55,833
Um,
hey,

1762
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:00,890
be careful because psychedelics can 
cause traumatic experiences.

1763
01:28:00,891 --> 01:28:02,570
Like those things are no joke,
man.

1764
01:28:02,930 --> 01:28:03,763
Um,
I don't think we know enough about them 

1765
01:28:05,481 --> 01:28:09,890
yet to make useful generalizations about
their hypothetical,

1766
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:11,570
um,
clinical utility.

1767
01:28:11,571 --> 01:28:15,530
There's some decent studies indicating 
with psilocybin for example,

1768
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,410
that it might have utility in the 
treatment of depression.

1769
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:21,410
It looks like it's a really effective 
smoking cessation medication,

1770
01:28:21,411 --> 01:28:23,360
which is really cool.
Um,

1771
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:24,583
so,
but I think what happened was that when 

1772
01:28:26,571 --> 01:28:29,120
the psychedelics burst onto the scene in
the 1960s,

1773
01:28:29,121 --> 01:28:29,954
they terrified us so much that like we 
all recoil at their very existence and 

1774
01:28:34,131 --> 01:28:36,950
then decided not to exactly.
Try to figure out what they were.

1775
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:37,903
And I can understand that man,
because those things are seriously 

1776
01:28:39,771 --> 01:28:40,604
weird.
Like they're there in comprehensively 

1777
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:46,280
strange.
I don't think we understand them at all.

1778
01:28:46,281 --> 01:28:49,160
I don't think we understand them any 
more than we understand consciousness.

1779
01:28:49,550 --> 01:28:52,610
I think that they may have great 
therapeutic utility,

1780
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:56,630
but you know,
there are viciously powerful medications

1781
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:59,210
and weapons and so you use them at your 
own peril.

1782
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,010
Something to that.
Carl Jung said,

1783
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:03,780
I really liked because he talked about 
psychedelic use a little bit,

1784
01:29:03,781 --> 01:29:06,870
although he was pretty old by the time 
the psychedelics burst on the scene.

1785
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:10,140
You know,
he said beware of unearned wisdom.

1786
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:11,813
And I really liked that because even if 
the psychedelics can open the gates of 

1787
01:29:15,571 --> 01:29:18,000
perception and flood you momentarily 
with,

1788
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:18,923
you know,
with information of genuine cosmic 

1789
01:29:20,611 --> 01:29:21,444
significance,
that doesn't mean that you're the sort 

1790
01:29:22,981 --> 01:29:23,814
of character,
you're not the sort of vessel that can 

1791
01:29:25,651 --> 01:29:29,070
tolerate being filled with that kind of 
divine fluid.

1792
01:29:29,071 --> 01:29:30,930
You know,
it might just break and crack you.

1793
01:29:30,931 --> 01:29:32,520
So I would say,
you know,

1794
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:34,613
approach those things with trepidation.
You should have the same attitude 

1795
01:29:37,381 --> 01:29:38,214
towards psychedelics that the ancient 
Israelites had towards the Ark of the 

1796
01:29:40,621 --> 01:29:41,640
covenant,
which was that,

1797
01:29:41,970 --> 01:29:43,050
you know,
God was in there.

1798
01:29:43,051 --> 01:29:46,030
But if you touched it accidentally,
you would die nuts.

1799
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:50,580
That's pretty good.
That's a pretty good general attitude.

1800
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:54,540
Have with regards to any serious 
encounter with psychedelics,

1801
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:57,210
those things require respect.
They're not toys,

1802
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:59,220
they're not games.
They're not fun.

1803
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:01,320
What?
We don't understand what they are,

1804
01:30:01,321 --> 01:30:03,080
but you know,
they're,

1805
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:06,960
they're worth treating with tremendous 
respect.

1806
01:30:13,890 --> 01:30:14,723
Oh,
if we have betrayed or let people down 

1807
01:30:15,721 --> 01:30:16,554
in the past,
how does one move on without guilt 

1808
01:30:17,971 --> 01:30:19,590
turning pathological?
Oh,

1809
01:30:19,591 --> 01:30:22,260
well that's,
that's actually fairly straightforward.

1810
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:23,333
The first thing I would say is you could
try using the past authoring program in 

1811
01:30:26,761 --> 01:30:28,260
the cell for three,
uh,

1812
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:31,500
sequence because it's actually designed 
to help people do that.

1813
01:30:31,501 --> 01:30:33,030
But here's the issue,
man.

1814
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:36,960
It's like you did something wrong and 
it's hurting you.

1815
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:38,850
Fair enough.
That hurts people.

1816
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,310
And what you have to do is you have to 
figure out,

1817
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:42,520
okay,

1818
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:43,353
what it was that you did wrong.
You have to figure out how it was that 

1819
01:30:47,651 --> 01:30:48,484
you got there.
You have to figure out how to change 

1820
01:30:50,981 --> 01:30:53,800
your life so that you won't go there 
anymore.

1821
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:56,410
You have to make amends for what you've 
done,

1822
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:59,950
not necessarily precisely to the people 
that you did it too,

1823
01:30:59,951 --> 01:31:00,784
because maybe you can't.
But you need to start to live your life 

1824
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,650
in a way that makes amends for what 
you've done.

1825
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:06,633
And then you have to let it go because 
people make mistakes and torturing 

1826
01:31:10,271 --> 01:31:14,800
yourself to death because you did 
something reprehensible and stupid isn't

1827
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:15,993
as useful as using the experience to 
transform yourself into someone moral 

1828
01:31:20,201 --> 01:31:21,820
and useful.
So

1829
01:31:23,530 --> 01:31:24,060
now,
you know,

1830
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:26,410
that's,
that's easier said than done obviously.

1831
01:31:26,411 --> 01:31:28,870
And I'm not,
I'm not in the least taking it lightly.

1832
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,130
I know that,
you know,

1833
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:31,053
you can do things in your life that are 
very bad and that are very hard to get 

1834
01:31:33,611 --> 01:31:34,480
over,
but

1835
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:36,150
okay,

1836
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:39,960
but adding your own misery to the misery
of the world when you could be out there

1837
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:43,320
doing good is probably not the best way 
to atone for your,

1838
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,600
for your past sins.
So,

1839
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,101
um,
you know,

1840
01:31:47,101 --> 01:31:49,110
and,
and people make mistakes.

1841
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:50,093
The trick is once you've made it to 
admit that you've made it to learn why 

1842
01:31:52,351 --> 01:31:55,710
you made it to transform yourself so you
don't make it any more.

1843
01:31:55,711 --> 01:31:58,200
And then to go out there and start 
acting like a proper person.

1844
01:31:58,770 --> 01:32:01,310
And it's one of the reasons I'm also 
kind of attracted to,

1845
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:04,060
to,
to some of the more fundamental elements

1846
01:32:04,061 --> 01:32:04,894
of the Christian doctrine because there 
is a doctrine of universal forgiveness 

1847
01:32:07,541 --> 01:32:08,374
that's embedded in that system.
But in the idea there basically is that 

1848
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:13,660
when people are fallible in a,
in a profound way,

1849
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:17,380
but if they atone,
they can be redeemed.

1850
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:18,713
And if they're penitent,
I mean that's where the word 

1851
01:32:20,021 --> 01:32:21,700
penitentiary comes from,
comes from,

1852
01:32:21,701 --> 01:32:23,290
by the way,
if they're penitent,

1853
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:24,453
if they go over their conscience,
if they confess to what they've done to 

1854
01:32:28,421 --> 01:32:30,340
themselves,
to God in society,

1855
01:32:30,341 --> 01:32:31,174
let's say,
and they attempt to strike out on a 

1856
01:32:33,611 --> 01:32:35,380
better path.
And that's all genuine.

1857
01:32:35,381 --> 01:32:38,410
It's like the idea as well.
Um,

1858
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:42,520
if you don't allow people who've made 
mistakes to move on,

1859
01:32:42,521 --> 01:32:43,354
then you just have to dispense with 
everyone because everyone's made 

1860
01:32:45,251 --> 01:32:46,240
mistakes.
Now,

1861
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:47,103
having said that,
I know there's difference between 

1862
01:32:48,641 --> 01:32:50,920
categories of mistakes,
but you know,

1863
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:57,390
forgiveness after repentance is a good 
moral axiom.

1864
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:02,373
As a female,
I never had a great inclination start a 

1865
01:33:04,481 --> 01:33:05,314
family after watching your material.
I'm struggling with how much of that 

1866
01:33:07,301 --> 01:33:08,134
drive is my own brainwashing is my own 
versus brainwashing versus third wave 

1867
01:33:11,441 --> 01:33:13,330
feminists.
How do I parse that out?

1868
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:19,450
That's a good question.
How would you parse that out?

1869
01:33:20,710 --> 01:33:21,490
Well,
I would,

1870
01:33:21,490 --> 01:33:22,323
I would start two things.
I would start by watching your dreams 

1871
01:33:25,511 --> 01:33:26,344
and your fantasies because they can tell
you things that you first of all might 

1872
01:33:29,981 --> 01:33:31,540
not want to know,
but also that you,

1873
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:32,523
that you don't know.
But I would also say try making a case 

1874
01:33:35,381 --> 01:33:36,940
for both sides.
You know,

1875
01:33:36,941 --> 01:33:40,480
like a really intelligent case.
So imagine that.

1876
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:41,613
So you're trying to figure this out.
So the first thing you do is formulate 

1877
01:33:43,691 --> 01:33:44,524
an argument where the proposition is 
that you've been brainwashed by third 

1878
01:33:48,521 --> 01:33:49,354
wave feminist and make the strongest 
possible argument you can in support of 

1879
01:33:53,141 --> 01:33:53,974
that.

1880
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:54,993
And then put that aside and then do the 
reverse and make the strongest argument 

1881
01:33:58,391 --> 01:34:02,020
you possibly can.
In favor of the idea that you're,

1882
01:34:02,890 --> 01:34:05,530
that this is your own idea and that for 
whatever reason,

1883
01:34:05,531 --> 01:34:08,380
you're not inclined to start a family.
You can even do the third thing,

1884
01:34:08,381 --> 01:34:09,214
which is to do another argument writing 
about why you should have a family and 

1885
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:15,280
really like that's thinking,
right?

1886
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:16,263
You got three arguments there.
You want to make each one of them is 

1887
01:34:18,041 --> 01:34:21,100
strong as you possibly can,
like really sweat over it.

1888
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:22,353
And then what having made the arguments,
allow yourself to contemplate them for 

1889
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:29,020
as much time as you need and it'll start
to become clear to you.

1890
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:30,153
So that's what I would recommend.
So I follow your daughter's food blog 

1891
01:34:35,021 --> 01:34:36,880
where she has recently talked about her 
pregnancy.

1892
01:34:36,881 --> 01:34:38,920
What are your thoughts on becoming a 
grandfather?

1893
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:40,510
Well,
lucky me man.

1894
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:41,763
I love kids and so,
and I get along really well with my 

1895
01:34:45,161 --> 01:34:46,810
kids,
so that's so great.

1896
01:34:46,811 --> 01:34:47,644
I just can't believe it.
And they live near near me in Toronto 

1897
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:54,520
and uh,
now there'd be another candidate and,

1898
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:55,633
and that'll be great for my wife because
loves babies and my daughter will like 

1899
01:34:58,851 --> 01:35:00,770
that too.
And you know,

1900
01:35:01,170 --> 01:35:03,290
as I said already about babies,
you know,

1901
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:06,950
they're not exactly,
I don't regard myself as a baby expert,

1902
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:11,420
but once the kid is like nine months old
and older than that,

1903
01:35:11,421 --> 01:35:14,300
and especially between like two and 11 
and teenagers too,

1904
01:35:14,301 --> 01:35:16,110
cause I like teenagers.
Um,

1905
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:19,040
it's like hooray,
I love kids.

1906
01:35:19,070 --> 01:35:22,620
And so it's wonderful.
And I lived long enough to become a,

1907
01:35:22,621 --> 01:35:24,320
be a grandfather and you know,
I'm not,

1908
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:26,870
I'm not three gorgeous dead yet or 
anything like that.

1909
01:35:26,871 --> 01:35:27,704
And so hooray.
It's great and hopefully it will happen 

1910
01:35:31,761 --> 01:35:33,080
some more.
So.

1911
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,700
Okay.
Um,

1912
01:35:39,380 --> 01:35:41,900
if dominance hierarchies select for 
heroes and breed them,

1913
01:35:41,901 --> 01:35:46,100
why then is Christ a celibate man?
Isn't celibacy and excuse for cowardice.

1914
01:35:47,030 --> 01:35:48,470
Oh,
that's a good one.

1915
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:52,433
Yeah.

1916
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:55,160
Well,
the first thing that's kind of odd about

1917
01:35:55,161 --> 01:35:55,994
Christ is an archetypal figure.
And this is something you commented on 

1918
01:35:58,311 --> 01:35:59,360
his,
he died pretty young.

1919
01:35:59,361 --> 01:36:00,830
He was only 32,
you know,

1920
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:01,933
so,
and young actually attributed the 

1921
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:06,403
obsession in our culture with youth to 
the fact that our divine finger never 

1922
01:36:09,921 --> 01:36:11,510
became mature.
Although you know,

1923
01:36:11,511 --> 01:36:13,880
we have the divine finger of God the 
father,

1924
01:36:13,881 --> 01:36:16,790
which I suppose would fill out the 
archetype to some degree.

1925
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:20,270
Um,
why is Christ a celibate man?

1926
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:24,410
Well,
I guess maybe you would say,

1927
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:33,213
yeah,
if you're in a situation where you can 

1928
01:36:34,971 --> 01:36:38,540
sacrifice yourself for the redemption of
all of mankind,

1929
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:39,673
maybe adding the responsibility of an 
individual family to that is just a bit 

1930
01:36:42,771 --> 01:36:43,910
too much.
I mean,

1931
01:36:43,911 --> 01:36:46,130
I know that's a bit of a Glib answer in 
some sense,

1932
01:36:46,131 --> 01:36:47,900
but there's something about it that's 
the case.

1933
01:36:47,930 --> 01:36:48,763
You know,
I mentioned earlier that now and then 

1934
01:36:50,150 --> 01:36:50,983
people have a calling of some sort that 
supersedes other callings that they 

1935
01:36:54,921 --> 01:36:55,754
could follow.
And I would say in the archetypal 

1936
01:36:58,370 --> 01:36:59,203
representation of Christ that that's 
something that could definitely be that 

1937
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:06,020
case could be made.
Um,

1938
01:37:06,830 --> 01:37:08,720
I,
I don't think that's a sufficient answer

1939
01:37:08,721 --> 01:37:09,554
though.
And I hope that when I get to the point 

1940
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:15,770
in the biblical series that I plan to 
run until I get through the whole Bible,

1941
01:37:15,771 --> 01:37:18,260
if I can manage it and that upon to take
a couple of years.

1942
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:21,260
That's the sort of question I'll be able
to address more fully.

1943
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:22,543
Okay.
So let's go back to the live question 

1944
01:37:24,051 --> 01:37:24,884
here.

1945
01:37:27,670 --> 01:37:28,503
Oh,
Zoltan Zoltar ftw I'm a BA in political 

1946
01:37:31,631 --> 01:37:33,400
science concentration,
political theory.

1947
01:37:33,401 --> 01:37:34,234
I haven't had any job offers in anything
other than retail or all commission 

1948
01:37:36,881 --> 01:37:39,810
sales in over a year.
What should I be applying for?

1949
01:37:40,330 --> 01:37:41,163
Well,
what I would say is take the best job 

1950
01:37:44,801 --> 01:37:46,720
you can find.
That could be retail.

1951
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:49,270
And I know retail jobs can be pretty 
miserable,

1952
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:51,520
but they may be better than no job at 
all.

1953
01:37:52,030 --> 01:37:54,460
If you have a job,
you're in a better position to find your

1954
01:37:54,461 --> 01:37:55,294
next job.
People would rather hire someone 

1955
01:37:56,911 --> 01:37:59,560
employed that someone who isn't employed
and,

1956
01:37:59,570 --> 01:38:02,100
and then you're also employed and you 
have some structure in your life.

1957
01:38:02,101 --> 01:38:02,934
And then I would also say don't 
underestimate the possibility of moving 

1958
01:38:06,511 --> 01:38:08,430
up in a retail job.
You know,

1959
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:09,450
you,
you can,

1960
01:38:09,451 --> 01:38:10,284
if you're smart and hardworking and 
you're with a company that's smart 

1961
01:38:12,751 --> 01:38:15,000
enough to bloody well recognize someone 
like that,

1962
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:16,133
the probability for advancement in that 
kind of corporate structure can be 

1963
01:38:18,631 --> 01:38:19,464
really great.
And so I would say if you're going to 

1964
01:38:21,031 --> 01:38:21,864
take a retail job,
take the damn thing seriously and don't 

1965
01:38:24,181 --> 01:38:27,710
feel like it's beneath you because every

1966
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:29,020
okay

1967
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:29,853
circumstance that you find yourself in 
as a human being is rich enough so that 

1968
01:38:33,761 --> 01:38:37,690
there's much that you can bring to it.
In terms of,

1969
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:41,320
of of useful commitment,
you know,

1970
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:42,183
like in a retail job,
well you have the opportunity to learn 

1971
01:38:44,141 --> 01:38:47,230
how to interact with customers.
You have the opportunity to learn how to

1972
01:38:47,231 --> 01:38:48,064
sell you.
These are big bloody skills if you can 

1973
01:38:50,891 --> 01:38:52,330
get them right,
you know,

1974
01:38:52,331 --> 01:38:53,164
you have the opportunity to learn how to
be grateful that you're not starving to 

1975
01:38:55,391 --> 01:38:57,220
death in a ditch.
You know?

1976
01:38:57,221 --> 01:38:58,054
And,
and it's not such a bad thing to start 

1977
01:39:00,431 --> 01:39:01,264
at the bottom because then you learn 
what the bottom is like can you learn 

1978
01:39:03,221 --> 01:39:06,520
how to move forward?
So I would say take the best job you can

1979
01:39:06,521 --> 01:39:10,120
find and then continue to look for other
jobs,

1980
01:39:10,121 --> 01:39:11,860
but,
but do the job right,

1981
01:39:11,890 --> 01:39:14,110
do it properly.
And one of the things,

1982
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:15,610
and I've had lots of,
um,

1983
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:17,013
what would you say,

1984
01:39:18,910 --> 01:39:21,250
I don't like to call them low end jobs,
but they're,

1985
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:22,630
they're,
they're,

1986
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:23,673
they're working class jobs.
I've had lots of working class jobs in 

1987
01:39:25,721 --> 01:39:27,850
my life,
like dozens of them really.

1988
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:33,870
And they're not trivial.
You can learn a lot in a,

1989
01:39:33,871 --> 01:39:37,060
in a working class job and you know,
you can learn how to get along with your

1990
01:39:37,061 --> 01:39:38,770
employee,
with your peers.

1991
01:39:38,830 --> 01:39:39,663
You can learn how to get along with your
supervisors and be useful to them and 

1992
01:39:42,821 --> 01:39:45,490
maybe be drawn to the retention if they 
have any sense.

1993
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:47,860
I mean,
if you have a retail job and it's,

1994
01:39:47,950 --> 01:39:51,400
they're treating you like a miserable 
slave and if you're doing a good job and

1995
01:39:51,401 --> 01:39:52,234
you get no credit for it,
it's like get the hell out of there as 

1996
01:39:53,561 --> 01:39:54,394
fast as he can.
But you want to find somewhere where if 

1997
01:39:57,071 --> 01:39:59,050
you work hard and you're a reasonable 
person,

1998
01:39:59,051 --> 01:40:02,230
that people are going to notice that and
open up doors of opportunity for you.

1999
01:40:02,290 --> 01:40:04,540
That's kind of the definition of a 
healthy company.

2000
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:06,790
And you can find that virtually 
anywhere.

2001
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:09,670
So don't be thinking that the retail 
jobs are necessarily,

2002
01:40:09,790 --> 01:40:11,320
you're not going to be there forever,
you know?

2003
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:15,250
And with a Ba you often have to start at
the bottom,

2004
01:40:15,251 --> 01:40:17,230
but that doesn't mean that that's where 
you're going to end up.

2005
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:19,090
So,
so don't,

2006
01:40:19,091 --> 01:40:22,390
don't feel too dismal about that it,
it's a start man.

2007
01:40:22,391 --> 01:40:25,810
And that's something,
and you could go into the retail job and

2008
01:40:25,811 --> 01:40:26,501
you could think,
okay,

2009
01:40:26,501 --> 01:40:27,334
like if I was really smart about this 
and I was really regarding this as an 

2010
01:40:29,501 --> 01:40:31,840
opportunity,
how can I knock this out of the park?

2011
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:35,470
And that's a good thing to think about.
And it beats the hell out of,

2012
01:40:35,510 --> 01:40:37,000
you know,
sitting there,

2013
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:39,040
and I'm not saying that you're 
necessarily doing this,

2014
01:40:39,041 --> 01:40:41,200
but feeling sorry for yourself because 
you know,

2015
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:44,350
you've got a degree in the world isn't 
an opening itself up to you.

2016
01:40:44,770 --> 01:40:45,603
It's like maybe it is,
maybe the retail job is opening itself 

2017
01:40:49,001 --> 01:40:50,410
up to you.
So,

2018
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:52,900
and then you work hard on developing 
your career.

2019
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:55,480
You've got a toehold in there.
And I know that's,

2020
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:58,360
maybe you might regard that as naively 
optimistic,

2021
01:40:58,361 --> 01:41:01,270
but that beats naively pessimistic.
And I,

2022
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:04,240
but I also do believe,
and I've seen this happen many times,

2023
01:41:04,241 --> 01:41:06,490
is that you can,

2024
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:07,590
okay

2025
01:41:07,590 --> 01:41:11,580
if,
if your attitude is if you have yourself

2026
01:41:11,730 --> 01:41:14,640
put together properly,
let's say sorted out properly,

2027
01:41:15,210 --> 01:41:16,043
you can make a hell of a positive impact
on the world in a relatively low level 

2028
01:41:19,951 --> 01:41:21,210
position.
You know,

2029
01:41:21,211 --> 01:41:23,970
cause you could make the person who 
walks into the store,

2030
01:41:23,971 --> 01:41:24,804
your retail operation,
you could make the next 10 minutes of 

2031
01:41:27,481 --> 01:41:30,750
their life a hell of a lot more pleasant
than they might be if you were miserable

2032
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:31,584
and resentful and you know,
maybe they'll come back again and maybe 

2033
01:41:33,721 --> 01:41:34,554
the store will thrive.
That's especially true if you start 

2034
01:41:36,271 --> 01:41:37,104
working for a smaller business man.
You can have a big effect on a small 

2035
01:41:39,241 --> 01:41:40,074
business.
So don't be thinking that there's no 

2036
01:41:41,581 --> 01:41:42,960
opportunity there.
You know,

2037
01:41:42,961 --> 01:41:46,020
it might be your inability to construe 
that as opportunity.

2038
01:41:46,021 --> 01:41:48,000
That's the,
it's what's interfering with it.

2039
01:41:48,330 --> 01:41:49,680
Believe me,
I know that,

2040
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:51,373
um,
especially chain retail jobs and 

2041
01:41:53,461 --> 01:41:57,030
especially if you have a dismal 
authoritarian manager,

2042
01:41:57,031 --> 01:41:58,650
that those jobs can just be hell.

2043
01:41:58,950 --> 01:41:59,783
But so I wouldn't recommend staying in a
job that's hell and where there's no 

2044
01:42:04,741 --> 01:42:07,230
further movement,
but don't necessarily think that you not

2045
01:42:07,231 --> 01:42:10,560
being an offer offered an opportunity if
you can take any job at all.

2046
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:12,870
You got to start somewhere man.
And,

2047
01:42:12,871 --> 01:42:14,100
and,
and the bottom,

2048
01:42:14,101 --> 01:42:14,934
like I said,
the bottom started bad place to start 

2049
01:42:16,171 --> 01:42:19,710
because he learned down there and 
someone who gets really good at business

2050
01:42:19,711 --> 01:42:20,970
across time,
let's say,

2051
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:24,990
knows whatever enterprise they're in 
from the bottom up.

2052
01:42:25,350 --> 01:42:27,660
And that's what makes them competent.
So,

2053
01:42:27,661 --> 01:42:28,950
and they don't say,
oh,

2054
01:42:28,951 --> 01:42:29,784
well the things that the Baltimore too,
they're not good enough for me because 

2055
01:42:33,421 --> 01:42:36,120
the things at the bottom are really what
the business rests on.

2056
01:42:36,121 --> 01:42:38,040
And you need to know how those things 
work.

2057
01:42:38,370 --> 01:42:39,203
And then you also have some sympathy for
the people who are maybe stuck in those 

2058
01:42:41,521 --> 01:42:43,530
positions forever,
which you wouldn't be,

2059
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:45,180
you know,
you won't be.

2060
01:42:45,690 --> 01:42:46,523
So,

2061
01:42:47,090 --> 01:42:47,500
okay.

2062
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:50,350
Okay.
Um,

2063
01:42:50,380 --> 01:42:52,300
let's see here.
What time is it?

2064
01:42:52,990 --> 01:42:56,290
Nine oh two and we started at seven 30.
Let's go to nine 30.

2065
01:42:56,291 --> 01:42:59,140
That's probably good enough.
So that's about 20 more minutes.

2066
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:04,680
Um,
Fab fab.

2067
01:43:05,330 --> 01:43:08,280
You ballinger advice for a breakup after
four years?

2068
01:43:08,281 --> 01:43:11,460
It's been 1.5 years and I still believe 
she's the one,

2069
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:17,750
well,
I would say she's at one and look,

2070
01:43:17,971 --> 01:43:20,280
some people really pair bond hard,
you know,

2071
01:43:20,281 --> 01:43:21,114
to put it in crass biological terms.
But if she's moved on and that's 

2072
01:43:25,171 --> 01:43:26,190
serious,
you know,

2073
01:43:26,490 --> 01:43:31,020
then I would say start,
start going out with other people,

2074
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:32,970
you know,
really and,

2075
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:33,833
and start
just because she's the one doesn't 

2076
01:43:36,821 --> 01:43:39,220
necessarily mean she's the only one,
you know,

2077
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,353
and
one and a half years that's long enough 

2078
01:43:44,251 --> 01:43:46,020
so that you should be starting to

2079
01:43:46,640 --> 01:43:47,080
okay.

2080
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:47,913
To Act as if you're getting over it.
And if you're having real trouble with 

2081
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:51,883
that,
then I think you should probably find 

2082
01:43:52,971 --> 01:43:56,420
someone to talk to and talk that out and
figure out what your strategy is.

2083
01:43:56,421 --> 01:43:58,190
But I would say get the hell back into 
life,

2084
01:43:58,191 --> 01:43:59,390
man.
Now,

2085
01:43:59,391 --> 01:44:00,224
if you know,
maybe there's part of you that still 

2086
01:44:02,661 --> 01:44:07,340
thinks that there's some possibility of 
rekindling the relationship and fry.

2087
01:44:07,341 --> 01:44:08,600
No,
maybe that's possible.

2088
01:44:08,630 --> 01:44:11,360
It seems unlikely because I don't think 
that you would.

2089
01:44:12,730 --> 01:44:13,470
Okay.

2090
01:44:13,470 --> 01:44:14,303
I don't think that you would be asking 
that question if you thought that was a 

2091
01:44:16,291 --> 01:44:17,124
possibility.
But I would say I'm going go find some 

2092
01:44:21,090 --> 01:44:22,030
other people,
man,

2093
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:23,083
and admit to the possibility that there 
might be someone else out there that 

2094
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:29,093
will work with you and get on with your 
life because you're going to be old a 

2095
01:44:31,741 --> 01:44:32,574
lot faster than you think.
And you don't want to be stuck in 

2096
01:44:35,041 --> 01:44:35,874
stacy's any longer than necessary 
because then you've lost the woman and 

2097
01:44:38,761 --> 01:44:43,080
you've lost your time and losing the 
woman is bad enough.

2098
01:44:43,081 --> 01:44:46,170
But losing the woman and your time,
that's really not good at all.

2099
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:50,470
So,
uh,

2100
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:51,413
let's see.
How do you get over hiding something 

2101
01:44:53,851 --> 01:44:54,684
because of the fear that people will 
think of you differently or treat you 

2102
01:44:56,401 --> 01:44:58,470
worse,
especially for family members and others

2103
01:44:58,471 --> 01:44:59,304
close to you.

2104
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:01,170
Yeah,

2105
01:45:01,170 --> 01:45:05,570
Quintin good width.
You know,

2106
01:45:05,590 --> 01:45:06,423
Quentin,
I don't know what to say about that 

2107
01:45:07,411 --> 01:45:10,050
because it depends on what your,
it depends on what you're hiding,

2108
01:45:10,980 --> 01:45:12,540
you know?
So

2109
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:19,060
I'd like to answer that question,
but it's not detailed enough.

2110
01:45:19,090 --> 01:45:21,280
The devil with questions like that,
man,

2111
01:45:21,281 --> 01:45:23,980
the devil is often really seriously in 
the details.

2112
01:45:23,981 --> 01:45:25,840
And uh,
I just,

2113
01:45:26,470 --> 01:45:29,170
if you think that you're hiding it 
because of cowardice,

2114
01:45:29,171 --> 01:45:31,420
that's one thing.
But like you might have a real problem,

2115
01:45:31,421 --> 01:45:33,190
you know,
when you're hiding something that really

2116
01:45:33,191 --> 01:45:34,024
would cause serious repercussions in 
your social circumstances and in your 

2117
01:45:37,631 --> 01:45:38,620
family,
in which case,

2118
01:45:38,621 --> 01:45:39,454
you know,
it's a hell of a tough thing to deal 

2119
01:45:40,151 --> 01:45:42,520
with.
And I would say you need to find someone

2120
01:45:42,521 --> 01:45:43,354
that you can talk to that you trust 
that's wise and maybe that'll be a 

2121
01:45:45,821 --> 01:45:46,780
professional.
But,

2122
01:45:47,550 --> 01:45:48,383
um,
or I would say the same thing that I 

2123
01:45:51,310 --> 01:45:52,143
mentioned earlier to,
to someone who had a similar question 

2124
01:45:53,951 --> 01:45:57,130
about strategy is like,
write down a strategy.

2125
01:45:57,490 --> 01:46:01,900
And then the other thing you could do 
too that's useful is imagine the worst.

2126
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:02,733
Okay.
Imagine you reveal whatever this is and 

2127
01:46:04,571 --> 01:46:07,720
the worst happens.
Lay out the worst.

2128
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:09,360
So you understand it.
You know,

2129
01:46:09,361 --> 01:46:13,780
it'd be be realistic about it and then 
figure out how you would handle it.

2130
01:46:14,860 --> 01:46:15,550
You know,
like,

2131
01:46:15,550 --> 01:46:16,383
you could imagine,
well everyone now hates me so much I 

2132
01:46:18,101 --> 01:46:22,330
have to move to a new town.
Well maybe you could do that,

2133
01:46:22,331 --> 01:46:23,164
you know,
and once you know that you could do 

2134
01:46:24,701 --> 01:46:25,534
that,
then maybe you wouldn't be so afraid 

2135
01:46:26,591 --> 01:46:27,424
about it.
So it's often the case that people are 

2136
01:46:29,801 --> 01:46:30,634
terrified about the terrible things that
might happen is cause they won't really 

2137
01:46:33,221 --> 01:46:36,220
think through what the terrible things 
are and what they would do.

2138
01:46:36,820 --> 01:46:37,653
And so think it through.
Think the catastrophe through and think 

2139
01:46:40,991 --> 01:46:42,910
about how you would cope with it if it 
happened.

2140
01:46:42,911 --> 01:46:44,650
And that should encourage you to some 
degree.

2141
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:48,790
So Benjamin would question what's wrong 
with maslow's?

2142
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:50,633
Uh,
what's wrong with maslow's hierarchy in 

2143
01:46:51,661 --> 01:46:52,494
my,
I was just writing about that yesterday 

2144
01:46:54,210 --> 01:46:56,100
day before and in my new book by the 
way,

2145
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:57,413
um,
maslow presumes that you have to meet 

2146
01:47:00,241 --> 01:47:02,700
your material needs before you can meet 
your spiritual needs.

2147
01:47:02,701 --> 01:47:04,860
And that's wrong.
That's just not right.

2148
01:47:04,890 --> 01:47:06,630
It's not wise.
I would say.

2149
01:47:07,010 --> 01:47:07,843
Um,
the read Viktor Frankl's man's search 

2150
01:47:10,771 --> 01:47:12,660
for meaning,
that's a good antidote to that.

2151
01:47:12,930 --> 01:47:13,763
And also again,
I would say read Social Knutson's Gulag 

2152
01:47:16,051 --> 01:47:16,884
archipelago,
especially volume two because Social 

2153
01:47:19,980 --> 01:47:20,813
Knutsen has done a tremendous job of 
dispelling the idea that material 

2154
01:47:25,171 --> 01:47:26,004
security and comfort is a prerequisite 
to higher order psychological and 

2155
01:47:31,171 --> 01:47:33,240
spiritual being.
So,

2156
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:38,430
so I think what's wrong with maslow's 
hierarchy,

2157
01:47:38,431 --> 01:47:39,264
the idea of maslow's hierarchy is that 
it's far too materialistic and its 

2158
01:47:43,711 --> 01:47:46,530
fundamental orientation.
Now having said that,

2159
01:47:46,531 --> 01:47:47,364
you know,
that doesn't mean that there's nothing 

2160
01:47:48,151 --> 01:47:48,984
useful in maslow's thinking.
I think that his discussions of self 

2161
01:47:52,351 --> 01:47:56,190
actualized persons are actually very 
interesting and the idea that,

2162
01:47:56,490 --> 01:47:58,500
you know,
there are higher levels of human,

2163
01:47:58,560 --> 01:47:59,393
human psychological and spiritual 
development and he was thinking about 

2164
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:05,010
more secularly I think is also extremely
useful.

2165
01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:10,050
But I think the idea of the manner in 
which you progress through the hierarchy

2166
01:48:10,051 --> 01:48:10,884
is wrong.
I also think it's a socialist idea in 

2167
01:48:12,961 --> 01:48:15,870
some sense because the,
and a utopian idea,

2168
01:48:15,871 --> 01:48:16,704
because the idea is the way that you 
bring about the perfect human societies 

2169
01:48:19,381 --> 01:48:22,920
by making sure that everyone's material 
wellbeing is,

2170
01:48:23,010 --> 01:48:23,843
is,
um,

2171
01:48:24,270 --> 01:48:25,500
is,
is,

2172
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:28,230
is established.
And look,

2173
01:48:28,231 --> 01:48:31,590
I know people need to eat and I know 
that they need security and all of that.

2174
01:48:31,591 --> 01:48:32,424
I understand that.
But assuming that that's a prerequisite 

2175
01:48:36,151 --> 01:48:36,984
for spiritual development is an error,
and assuming that it's a necessary 

2176
01:48:40,921 --> 01:48:43,420
prerequisite is even a more,
uh,

2177
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:45,660
uh,
egregious error,

2178
01:48:45,661 --> 01:48:46,494
I would say.
So can you further explain your 

2179
01:48:49,411 --> 01:48:52,890
disapproval of Ayn Rand?
I don't really disapprove of Ayn rand.

2180
01:48:52,891 --> 01:48:54,420
I liked reading her novels,
you know,

2181
01:48:54,421 --> 01:48:59,421
and I think it's funny because I was 
given Ayn rand's novels by a woman named

2182
01:48:59,521 --> 01:49:01,350
Rachel Notley,
who is the mother,

2183
01:49:01,351 --> 01:49:02,184
was the mother of,
because unfortunately she's deceased of 

2184
01:49:04,741 --> 01:49:08,010
the current socialist premier of 
Alberta.

2185
01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:13,550
Rachel Notley who was a friend of mine 
when I was kid and it was her mother who

2186
01:49:13,561 --> 01:49:14,394
has an avowed socialist of the,
of the pro working class classical type 

2187
01:49:18,090 --> 01:49:18,923
who gave me Ayn rand as well as George 
Orwell and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and 

2188
01:49:23,581 --> 01:49:24,414
eldest Huxley,
a whole raft of really high quality 

2189
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,900
literature,
literary books.

2190
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:30,670
And uh,
she wanted to be,

2191
01:49:30,870 --> 01:49:32,890
she wanted to expose me to that 
philosophy.

2192
01:49:32,891 --> 01:49:36,000
And like I found Ayn rand's books I 
really liked reading of,

2193
01:49:36,010 --> 01:49:38,190
they're really romantic.
Um,

2194
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:39,120
they're,
they're,

2195
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:41,670
they're interesting adventure stories,
I would say.

2196
01:49:41,671 --> 01:49:43,500
And you know,
Ayn rand had a point.

2197
01:49:43,501 --> 01:49:44,730
I mean,
she had a hell.

2198
01:49:44,731 --> 01:49:48,040
Her family had a hell of a time with the
communists in the Soviet Union.

2199
01:49:48,041 --> 01:49:49,960
Like she had reasons for doing what she 
was doing.

2200
01:49:49,961 --> 01:49:50,794
But the problem with Ayn rand as a 
literary figure is that all here heroes 

2201
01:49:55,031 --> 01:49:58,240
are the same people and they're 
completely heroic.

2202
01:49:58,450 --> 01:50:01,150
And the whole,
her villains are the same people,

2203
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:03,550
the same person,
just in different bodies.

2204
01:50:03,670 --> 01:50:06,580
And they're all almost completely 
reprehensible.

2205
01:50:06,850 --> 01:50:07,690
And so,
you know,

2206
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:08,883
one of the hallmarks of high quality 
literature is that the battle between 

2207
01:50:12,761 --> 01:50:17,761
good and evil isn't just fought out 
between the good guys and the bad guys.

2208
01:50:18,340 --> 01:50:19,173
Like at a cultural level.
That would be an identity politics 

2209
01:50:21,551 --> 01:50:26,551
issues say and that it's not the good 
guy as an individual who's like the next

2210
01:50:26,981 --> 01:50:28,240
Messiah in,
in,

2211
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:30,610
in Ayn rand,
that would be the capitalist Messiah.

2212
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:32,470
And then the evil,
reprehensible,

2213
01:50:32,471 --> 01:50:34,990
satanic figure.
And you know,

2214
01:50:34,991 --> 01:50:35,824
all of the good traits are embodied in 
one and all of the bad traits in the 

2215
01:50:38,081 --> 01:50:40,870
other,
in in really sophisticated literature.

2216
01:50:40,871 --> 01:50:44,560
I would say that even the villains have 
good qualities.

2217
01:50:44,710 --> 01:50:49,710
Like villains are way more interesting 
when they're also interestingly good and

2218
01:50:51,010 --> 01:50:53,380
you know,
risk the cove in crime and punishment is

2219
01:50:53,381 --> 01:50:54,214
a good example of that.
And all of dusty huskies villains for 

2220
01:50:55,871 --> 01:50:59,650
that matter because they have deeply 
admirable qualities.

2221
01:50:59,650 --> 01:51:02,710
Like Ivan for example,
who's not exactly a villain but,

2222
01:51:02,770 --> 01:51:04,810
but he,
he certainly atheistic,

2223
01:51:05,170 --> 01:51:07,690
which,
which put them at Owens with Dostoyevsky

2224
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:10,000
in the brothers.
Karamazov I mean,

2225
01:51:10,060 --> 01:51:12,220
Ivan has everything going for him.
He's good looking.

2226
01:51:12,221 --> 01:51:13,360
He's dashing.
He's young,

2227
01:51:13,361 --> 01:51:14,230
he's brave.
He's,

2228
01:51:14,231 --> 01:51:14,981
uh,
he's,

2229
01:51:14,981 --> 01:51:16,930
he's got military training.
Like he's,

2230
01:51:17,170 --> 01:51:18,003
he's,
uh,

2231
01:51:18,310 --> 01:51:20,110
he's,
he's clearheaded,

2232
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:25,600
he's a hell of a villain.
He's a great villain man and Ayn rand.

2233
01:51:25,601 --> 01:51:26,434
It's just like,
it's just too formulaic in my 

2234
01:51:30,551 --> 01:51:31,384
estimation.
And so it starts to verge on the 

2235
01:51:32,501 --> 01:51:33,334
ideological,
and she was primarily motivated by 

2236
01:51:35,380 --> 01:51:38,830
making a political point rather than by 
writing literature in my estimation.

2237
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:41,050
So that's all.
I mean,

2238
01:51:41,051 --> 01:51:43,750
and having said that,
I would also say I got great pleasure in

2239
01:51:43,751 --> 01:51:46,390
reading Ayn rand's books,
so I'm not,

2240
01:51:46,540 --> 01:51:49,480
I don't precisely disapprove of her.
She isn't,

2241
01:51:49,481 --> 01:51:50,314
she just isn't a top rate philosopher 
and she's also not a top rate literary 

2242
01:51:54,911 --> 01:51:55,300
figure.

2243
01:51:55,300 --> 01:51:56,133
And those are the reasons she's little 
bit to propaganda stick and her 

2244
01:52:00,641 --> 01:52:04,660
characters are too unidimensional.
So yeah,

2245
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:08,110
that's why.
Okay.

2246
01:52:08,111 --> 01:52:09,620
Let's see here.
Uh,

2247
01:52:09,670 --> 01:52:12,460
fresh sweet says Jordan is a mental 
midget.

2248
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:14,440
Well,
I'm tall,

2249
01:52:14,441 --> 01:52:18,610
so I at least I'm also,
I've got some elements of me that aren't

2250
01:52:18,611 --> 01:52:20,200
entirely midget likes.
So,

2251
01:52:20,590 --> 01:52:21,640
um,
uh,

2252
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:23,673
let's see.
So what else do I have to say about 

2253
01:52:24,641 --> 01:52:25,870
that?
Um,

2254
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:30,430
while it's conceivable that fresh sweet 
is a mental giant by comparison,

2255
01:52:30,431 --> 01:52:31,264
but I doubt if he or she would have used
that in salt if that happened to be the 

2256
01:52:35,501 --> 01:52:37,780
case.
So let's see,

2257
01:52:39,010 --> 01:52:42,850
someone said please,
can I say their name?

2258
01:52:43,930 --> 01:52:46,010
And the answer to that is no,

2259
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:46,843
because I've

2260
01:52:47,470 --> 01:52:48,303
mmm,

2261
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:52,880
lost your question.
So I read your question,

2262
01:52:52,881 --> 01:52:55,310
but I'm not going to say your name so 
well that's,

2263
01:52:55,370 --> 01:52:57,590
that's ironic I suppose.
Oh,

2264
01:52:57,591 --> 01:52:58,550
sharp girl,
Sikhs.

2265
01:52:58,551 --> 01:53:01,220
Are there evil persons with no redeeming
qualities?

2266
01:53:03,940 --> 01:53:04,773
No,

2267
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:08,030
that would be just too simple,
man.

2268
01:53:11,150 --> 01:53:12,950
Yep.
It'd be nice if that was the case,

2269
01:53:12,951 --> 01:53:13,820
you know,
you know what I mean?

2270
01:53:13,821 --> 01:53:14,654
Not exactly nice,
but know that it just isn't how life 

2271
01:53:16,371 --> 01:53:17,204
works,
man.

2272
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:19,640
It's,
it's as social knits and said,

2273
01:53:19,641 --> 01:53:21,140
you know,
even in the best person,

2274
01:53:21,141 --> 01:53:24,770
there's still some uprooted,
uprooted corner of evil.

2275
01:53:24,771 --> 01:53:28,880
And even in the person who's gone as far
down the rabbit hole as you can possibly

2276
01:53:28,881 --> 01:53:31,760
go,
there's some still shining element of,

2277
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:32,773
of,
of the divine quality of humanity that 

2278
01:53:34,761 --> 01:53:39,020
could be communicated with.
So at least that's how it looks to me.

2279
01:53:39,050 --> 01:53:41,180
So,
okay.

2280
01:53:44,230 --> 01:53:46,360
How do you make time to read for 
leisure?

2281
01:53:46,640 --> 01:53:47,800
I,
right now I don't,

2282
01:53:48,430 --> 01:53:49,263
in fact,
I don't make enough time to read period 

2283
01:53:51,550 --> 01:53:52,990
and,
but I hope to rectify that.

2284
01:53:52,991 --> 01:53:54,620
Sue.
Mostly I'm,

2285
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:58,120
I'm editing the things that I'm writing 
and mostly I'm writing.

2286
01:53:58,121 --> 01:53:59,340
So,
um,

2287
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:02,950
but when I do read most of the,
I've read before I go to bed,

2288
01:54:03,070 --> 01:54:06,280
I go to bed and I read for half an hour,
an hour or something like that.

2289
01:54:06,281 --> 01:54:07,114
So

2290
01:54:08,240 --> 01:54:08,480
okay,

2291
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:09,313
I'm 23 wheelchair bound.
I can't afford college and don't have 

2292
01:54:11,481 --> 01:54:14,690
the services to get me through it.
And I'm glad I found you online.

2293
01:54:14,691 --> 01:54:17,210
My favorite subject is psychology.
I'm very intrigued by it.

2294
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:18,800
Great.
That's native to wise.

2295
01:54:19,010 --> 01:54:20,300
Hey,
so good man.

2296
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:25,190
Watch the lectures and then go take a 
look at my reading list at Jordan B.

2297
01:54:25,190 --> 01:54:26,023
Peterson,
dark tom and get those books you can 

2298
01:54:27,531 --> 01:54:28,364
get.
Most of them used online for next to 

2299
01:54:29,751 --> 01:54:31,430
nothing.
And even the ones you have to buy,

2300
01:54:31,431 --> 01:54:32,270
man,
it's worth it.

2301
01:54:32,390 --> 01:54:34,430
Or get them from the library or 
something like that.

2302
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:35,900
So,
and,

2303
01:54:36,980 --> 01:54:37,813
and you know,
you can educate yourself to a large 

2304
01:54:39,831 --> 01:54:40,664
degree.
You got a f I'm going to expand that 

2305
01:54:41,511 --> 01:54:42,344
reading list,
two to maybe a hundred bucks or 

2306
01:54:43,431 --> 01:54:44,264
something like that because Jesus,
especially what's really funny about 

2307
01:54:47,721 --> 01:54:50,450
books too is the better the book,
the cheaper it is.

2308
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:53,090
It's so funny because you can buy 
penguin classics,

2309
01:54:53,091 --> 01:54:56,330
for example,
literature classics for like 1 cent plus

2310
01:54:56,331 --> 01:54:57,860
shipping.
What a deal,

2311
01:54:57,890 --> 01:54:59,090
you know,
so,

2312
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:00,553
so,
and some of them you can just get for 

2313
01:55:01,251 --> 01:55:02,084
free now because the copyrights have 
expired and you can download them on 

2314
01:55:04,581 --> 01:55:06,890
your kindle and they don't cost you a 
sense.

2315
01:55:06,891 --> 01:55:09,750
So what do I do for fun?
Hmm,

2316
01:55:10,730 --> 01:55:11,870
what do I do for fun?

2317
01:55:16,430 --> 01:55:19,040
I build things in the backyard.
I like doing that.

2318
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:21,590
Um,
I play ping pong with my son,

2319
01:55:21,591 --> 01:55:24,400
except I taught him how to play ping 
pong and now he's way better than me,

2320
01:55:24,410 --> 01:55:27,560
just stumps me in and that any laughs a 
lot about that.

2321
01:55:27,561 --> 01:55:29,570
So that's very annoying.
Um,

2322
01:55:29,630 --> 01:55:31,610
I spend time with my wife,
although not enough,

2323
01:55:31,611 --> 01:55:35,570
especially in the last seven months 
because I've been completely overwhelmed

2324
01:55:35,571 --> 01:55:37,290
by all of this.
Um,

2325
01:55:41,250 --> 01:55:42,570
what else do I do for fun?

2326
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:47,430
Snack on social justice warriors.
That's kind of entertaining.

2327
01:55:48,130 --> 01:55:48,963
MMM.

2328
01:55:53,410 --> 01:55:55,780
Spend time with my family.
That's probably the biggest thing.

2329
01:55:55,781 --> 01:55:57,970
I talk with my friends.
Um,

2330
01:55:58,360 --> 01:56:00,550
you know,
standard sorts of things like that.

2331
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:01,873
Um,
I find most of what I do in my life 

2332
01:56:04,750 --> 01:56:06,940
extraordinarily engaging and 
entertaining.

2333
01:56:06,941 --> 01:56:08,210
So,
um,

2334
01:56:08,650 --> 01:56:11,950
except when I'm overwhelmed by it and 
that's been,

2335
01:56:12,130 --> 01:56:15,010
that's happened to be partly because of 
the mood issues I talked about,

2336
01:56:15,011 --> 01:56:17,710
but also partly because like the last 
seven or eight months,

2337
01:56:17,711 --> 01:56:21,970
it's really been
both surreal and overwhelming.

2338
01:56:22,150 --> 01:56:24,100
I'm usually so engaged in what I'm doing
that,

2339
01:56:24,190 --> 01:56:25,540
that,
um,

2340
01:56:27,410 --> 01:56:28,120
um,
I,

2341
01:56:28,120 --> 01:56:30,510
I wouldn't say I'm not looking for 
funding exactly.

2342
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:33,990
It's that I have a bunch of it already.
Kyle Mitchel says,

2343
01:56:33,991 --> 01:56:37,020
what should I do if my girlfriend isn't 
satisfying me sexually?

2344
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:38,880
How do I get her to progress with me?

2345
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:41,080
Oh,
well,

2346
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:45,700
that's a place that you can usually use.
Really use both discourse and reward.

2347
01:56:45,701 --> 01:56:46,241
It's like,
okay,

2348
01:56:46,241 --> 01:56:47,410
well,
what do you want?

2349
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:50,980
That's the first question.
And you know,

2350
01:56:51,370 --> 01:56:56,370
could you make your wants known and are 
there ways that you can express the fact

2351
01:56:56,651 --> 01:57:01,651
that you're happy about that that would 
be compatible with the person's desires?

2352
01:57:01,811 --> 01:57:02,531
You know,
it's a lot of,

2353
01:57:02,531 --> 01:57:05,170
it's a lot of that is often lack of 
communication.

2354
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:06,393
But you know,
you could also do what skinner did when 

2355
01:57:09,821 --> 01:57:13,150
he was training rats,
which is watch your partner,

2356
01:57:14,530 --> 01:57:16,630
you know,
during sexual encounters and otherwise,

2357
01:57:16,631 --> 01:57:19,690
and when they do something that you 
really like and really want them to keep

2358
01:57:19,691 --> 01:57:20,980
doing,
like let them know,

2359
01:57:21,010 --> 01:57:22,870
you know,
that's intelligent use of reward.

2360
01:57:22,871 --> 01:57:26,470
But a lot of it is just discussion.
You know,

2361
01:57:26,471 --> 01:57:27,304
it's like first of all,
figure out what you want and discuss 

2362
01:57:29,591 --> 01:57:31,750
with the person what you want and find 
out what,

2363
01:57:31,751 --> 01:57:34,690
why they're objecting and you know,
do some negotiation.

2364
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:37,200
And if you can't talk,
here's a good rule of thumb.

2365
01:57:37,220 --> 01:57:41,650
I think for especially for young people 
who are engaging in new relationships is

2366
01:57:41,651 --> 01:57:42,484
it don't do anything sexually with 
anyone that you couldn't talk to them 

2367
01:57:46,361 --> 01:57:49,420
about before you did it.
I think that's a funny one.

2368
01:57:49,421 --> 01:57:52,630
So,
and I think it's true too.

2369
01:57:56,830 --> 01:57:59,650
Okay.
Jordan,

2370
01:57:59,651 --> 01:58:02,620
what are your thoughts on George Orwell?
Brilliant.

2371
01:58:02,890 --> 01:58:04,810
George Orwell man,
more power to him.

2372
01:58:04,990 --> 01:58:07,480
He was,
he was really something like he,

2373
01:58:07,870 --> 01:58:10,120
he was a major influence on me and you 
know,

2374
01:58:10,121 --> 01:58:10,954
he was beating,
he was climbing the warning bell about 

2375
01:58:13,991 --> 01:58:15,610
communism,
you know,

2376
01:58:16,870 --> 01:58:21,100
a good 30 years before the corrupt 
French intellectuals woke up,

2377
01:58:21,101 --> 01:58:22,810
had admitted that they'd been 
worshiping,

2378
01:58:22,811 --> 01:58:23,700
uh,
you know,

2379
01:58:23,701 --> 01:58:24,534
uh,
a murderous tyrant for the last almost 

2380
01:58:29,380 --> 01:58:30,213
century.
I really go George Orwell man and he's 

2381
01:58:33,100 --> 01:58:34,840
such a clear writer.
Great scs.

2382
01:58:34,841 --> 01:58:35,674
Like a real,
a real example for anyone who wants to 

2383
01:58:37,541 --> 01:58:39,790
learn to write.
That's Orwell like hemingway,

2384
01:58:40,120 --> 01:58:41,270
you know,
um,

2385
01:58:41,410 --> 01:58:45,100
although I think that or Orwell was a 
greater figure than hemingway.

2386
01:58:45,101 --> 01:58:45,934
All things considered.
Hemingway could really write it tight 

2387
01:58:47,981 --> 01:58:49,570
sentence man.
And he could,

2388
01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:50,583
he could say a lot with,
with very few words and that's really 

2389
01:58:53,261 --> 01:58:55,630
something worth worth taking a look at 
too.

2390
01:58:57,610 --> 01:59:00,050
Okay.
Tjf Advice.

2391
01:59:00,220 --> 01:59:01,053
Advice for aspiring academics,
specifically philosophy graduate 

2392
01:59:03,311 --> 01:59:06,730
students that read every God damn thing 
you can get your hands on.

2393
01:59:06,731 --> 01:59:09,820
Matt,
read all the great philosophers and,

2394
01:59:09,821 --> 01:59:10,654
and,
and make notes and write about them as 

2395
01:59:12,701 --> 01:59:13,534
well.
Till you understand them until you have 

2396
01:59:14,411 --> 01:59:16,090
them under your belt.
And so,

2397
01:59:16,150 --> 01:59:16,983
and do that at the same time while 
you're going through getting your 

2398
01:59:19,001 --> 01:59:20,050
degree.
You know,

2399
01:59:20,051 --> 01:59:20,884
because a lot of the education that you 
get in university at graduate level 

2400
01:59:24,221 --> 01:59:25,054
isn't going to be very good.
The courses are generally not very good 

2401
01:59:27,821 --> 01:59:30,850
in my experience.
But man,

2402
01:59:30,970 --> 01:59:33,310
read,
there's great people to read.

2403
01:59:33,311 --> 01:59:34,780
So start at the beginning,
you know,

2404
01:59:34,810 --> 01:59:37,450
go back to socrates and,
and,

2405
01:59:37,810 --> 01:59:41,210
and read everything you can get your 
hands on and,

2406
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:42,153
and do the work necessary so that you 
understand the philosophers and you can 

2407
01:59:44,921 --> 01:59:45,754
start like,
I found real useful way to start 

2408
01:59:47,621 --> 01:59:48,454
introducing yourself to philosophers is 
pickup and this is good for everyone 

2409
01:59:52,031 --> 01:59:54,390
else who's out there to pick up like,
um,

2410
01:59:54,700 --> 01:59:57,320
um,
a plato for dummies or,

2411
01:59:57,321 --> 01:59:59,560
or,
or Nicha for dummies or you know,

2412
01:59:59,561 --> 02:00:01,600
one of those illustrated introductions.

2413
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:02,890
Christ,
it's a good start.

2414
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:06,250
You start slow and,
and start building up your expertise and

2415
02:00:06,251 --> 02:00:08,050
move towards the,
the actual,

2416
02:00:08,110 --> 02:00:08,943
you know,
the actual difficult writings 

2417
02:00:09,731 --> 02:00:11,260
themselves.
So

2418
02:00:13,690 --> 02:00:14,523
how do you motivate yourself to do 
something that you do not enjoy but you 

2419
02:00:16,901 --> 02:00:19,000
deem important?
Like studying for exams?

2420
02:00:19,450 --> 02:00:21,710
Good question.
Um,

2421
02:00:22,120 --> 02:00:25,840
ask yourself what would motivate you?
You know,

2422
02:00:25,841 --> 02:00:26,674
first of all,
don't be studying eight hours a day 

2423
02:00:29,081 --> 02:00:31,420
cause that isn't going to work and 
you're not going to do it anyways.

2424
02:00:31,660 --> 02:00:32,493
You know,
when you start studying five minutes a 

2425
02:00:34,361 --> 02:00:35,530
day,
seriously,

2426
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:36,393
would you,
could you bring it up to 10 minutes a 

2427
02:00:37,481 --> 02:00:38,314
day?
What would you have to do for yourself 

2428
02:00:40,301 --> 02:00:43,470
to get yourself to sit down for half an 
hour a day and,

2429
02:00:43,550 --> 02:00:46,390
and study intently?
Like maybe you'd have to,

2430
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:49,900
I dunno what you'd have to do,
like have a beer at six o'clock at night

2431
02:00:49,901 --> 02:00:50,380
or something.

2432
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:53,140
Or maybe you'd have to go for a walk in 
the park or go out for coffee.

2433
02:00:53,141 --> 02:00:53,974
It's like,
imagine that you're sitting down with a 

2434
02:00:55,271 --> 02:00:56,104
stupid undisciplined child who,
and you're trying to get that child to 

2435
02:01:00,341 --> 02:01:01,510
do something useful.
And you say,

2436
02:01:01,511 --> 02:01:02,344
okay,
look,

2437
02:01:02,770 --> 02:01:04,990
I want you to do x.
It's necessary,

2438
02:01:05,140 --> 02:01:07,300
but you can pick how much of it you're 
going to do.

2439
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:10,290
And I'll give you what you want if you 
do it well,

2440
02:01:10,330 --> 02:01:14,770
ask yourself that and see what happens.
So don't try to tyrannized yourself,

2441
02:01:14,771 --> 02:01:15,604
you know,
try to negotiate with yourself and use 

2442
02:01:16,841 --> 02:01:19,870
some reward and see how that works and 
start slow.

2443
02:01:19,871 --> 02:01:20,704
You know,
maybe,

2444
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:21,633
maybe you're not very disciplined and 
the best you can do is half an hour of 

2445
02:01:23,891 --> 02:01:25,810
studying a day.
Well,

2446
02:01:26,020 --> 02:01:29,380
start with half an hour.
Increase that five minutes a week.

2447
02:01:29,620 --> 02:01:30,700
You know,
if you do that,

2448
02:01:30,701 --> 02:01:31,750
that's a lot.
If you,

2449
02:01:31,780 --> 02:01:33,900
if you do that for a year,
then you'll,

2450
02:01:33,970 --> 02:01:36,520
by the end of the year,
you'll be studying four hours a day.

2451
02:01:37,030 --> 02:01:38,300
So you can,
that's,

2452
02:01:38,330 --> 02:01:41,030
that's just with five,
that's just with five minutes a week,

2453
02:01:41,031 --> 02:01:43,220
right?
Because that's 250 minutes in a year.

2454
02:01:43,850 --> 02:01:48,600
So start ridiculously pathetically,
um,

2455
02:01:48,620 --> 02:01:53,620
study for five minutes a day for a week 
and then move it to 10.

2456
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:57,980
You'll be able to do that and don't 
cheat.

2457
02:01:57,981 --> 02:01:58,814
You know,
because one of the things people do is 

2458
02:01:59,721 --> 02:02:01,280
they make a deal with themselves like 
that.

2459
02:02:01,310 --> 02:02:02,143
I'm all,
I'm going to study for 10 minutes a day 

2460
02:02:03,801 --> 02:02:05,120
each day.
And then they,

2461
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:06,770
they get into it,
they think,

2462
02:02:06,771 --> 02:02:08,000
wow,
this is going really good.

2463
02:02:08,001 --> 02:02:08,834
So they study for two hours and then 
they broke the contract with themselves 

2464
02:02:11,541 --> 02:02:12,374
and they don't trust themselves anymore.
And then they don't study for a whole 

2465
02:02:15,110 --> 02:02:17,690
year or well,
maybe not for a month.

2466
02:02:18,050 --> 02:02:20,180
So,
but set your contract,

2467
02:02:20,690 --> 02:02:21,890
ask yourself,
you know,

2468
02:02:22,070 --> 02:02:22,903
what could I do to move myself forward 
to my goal that I would do and then how 

2469
02:02:29,211 --> 02:02:30,044
can I improve that incrementally?
So that's the right way of going about 

2470
02:02:32,841 --> 02:02:34,010
that.
So,

2471
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:35,233
okay.
What do you think about the line that's 

2472
02:02:39,051 --> 02:02:42,440
often fed to young people to do what you
love and follow your dreams?

2473
02:02:43,670 --> 02:02:44,720
Well,
you know,

2474
02:02:59,020 --> 02:03:01,210
there's something to be said for doing 
what grips you,

2475
02:03:01,211 --> 02:03:03,580
but you know,
you have to Lr that with discipline.

2476
02:03:04,630 --> 02:03:05,463
That's the thing.
And you have to ally with 

2477
02:03:07,631 --> 02:03:09,460
responsibility.
And so,

2478
02:03:10,210 --> 02:03:11,043
and,
and I would also say that that advice 

2479
02:03:12,371 --> 02:03:13,450
say,
which,

2480
02:03:13,630 --> 02:03:17,170
which I think has been most popularly 
associated with Joseph Campbell,

2481
02:03:17,171 --> 02:03:21,790
was actually to some degree something 
that was at least initiated by young.

2482
02:03:21,791 --> 02:03:26,791
But one of the things you said was more 
like follow what grips and compels you.

2483
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:27,933
And it will take you into the underworld
where you will encounter your shadow 

2484
02:03:30,461 --> 02:03:33,680
when the dragon and,
and when,

2485
02:03:33,681 --> 02:03:36,010
when you put it that way,
it's a lot more realistic.

2486
02:03:36,810 --> 02:03:41,770
It,
it's just to a naive and,

2487
02:03:41,860 --> 02:03:43,120
and,
and,

2488
02:03:43,690 --> 02:03:46,780
and too good to be true to be a good 
doctrine.

2489
02:03:46,900 --> 02:03:49,930
Although I think there's some,
there's an element of truth in it.

2490
02:03:50,140 --> 02:03:50,973
You do want to follow your dreams but 
not if your dream changes every 30 

2491
02:03:56,261 --> 02:03:57,094
seconds.

2492
02:03:57,520 --> 02:03:59,530
You know,
like with the future authoring program,

2493
02:03:59,531 --> 02:04:04,180
one of the things we get people to do is
to detail out a vision for the future.

2494
02:04:05,620 --> 02:04:07,960
If you could have the future that you 
dreamed of having,

2495
02:04:07,961 --> 02:04:09,580
what would,
what would that dream be?

2496
02:04:09,581 --> 02:04:10,414
That's really useful.
But then the next part of the exercise 

2497
02:04:12,341 --> 02:04:13,174
is,
okay,

2498
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:16,630
how are you going to do the hard 
discipline,

2499
02:04:16,660 --> 02:04:17,493
multiyear work necessarily necessary to 
bring that dream into reality and how 

2500
02:04:20,921 --> 02:04:25,360
are you going to make that realistic and
implementable on a day to day,

2501
02:04:25,740 --> 02:04:30,100
um,
on a day to day on a day to day level.

2502
02:04:30,970 --> 02:04:33,460
So you got to bring your dream down to 
Earth,

2503
02:04:33,461 --> 02:04:35,490
man and,
and,

2504
02:04:35,500 --> 02:04:38,130
and act it out.
And you have to disciplined to do that.

2505
02:04:38,490 --> 02:04:39,323
And so that's,
that's the part that's missing there is 

2506
02:04:41,450 --> 02:04:42,283
um,
do what you love and discipline 

2507
02:04:44,191 --> 02:04:46,650
yourself.
That's a good combination.

2508
02:04:46,890 --> 02:04:47,723
That's a good combination.
What are your thoughts on sleep 

2509
02:04:49,201 --> 02:04:49,890
paralysis?

2510
02:04:49,890 --> 02:04:53,490
That happens to me all the time.
So it exists.

2511
02:04:53,610 --> 02:04:56,760
I mean
I often have,

2512
02:04:56,780 --> 02:04:58,650
it happened to me this weekend for 
example.

2513
02:04:58,651 --> 02:04:59,910
It's quite,
it's quite

2514
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:04,740
comical.
So if I go to sleep on my back,

2515
02:05:04,741 --> 02:05:07,650
sometimes I will dream that I'm trying 
to wake up,

2516
02:05:07,651 --> 02:05:08,484
but I can't.
And so I am trying to wake up but I'm 

2517
02:05:10,501 --> 02:05:11,334
asleep and I'm still paralyzed because 
you get paralyzed when you're in rem 

2518
02:05:14,971 --> 02:05:18,120
sleep so you don't run around and act 
out your dreams and smash your nose into

2519
02:05:18,121 --> 02:05:21,060
a wall like cats do if you take that 
part of their brain out.

2520
02:05:21,570 --> 02:05:26,570
And so I often dreamed that I'm kind of 
semi comatose and I know I can't wake up

2521
02:05:30,060 --> 02:05:30,893
and I'm like grabbing out my daughters 
sleeve too and saying throw cold water 

2522
02:05:36,841 --> 02:05:40,020
on me or shake me or something or push 
me out of bed because I can't wake up.

2523
02:05:40,020 --> 02:05:43,050
And then she'll ignore me and then I'll 
try and get my wife to do it in my dream

2524
02:05:43,051 --> 02:05:45,060
and it like,
it seems like it lasts an hour.

2525
02:05:45,360 --> 02:05:49,680
And then finally I'll shake myself awake
and I'm often end up when I wake up like

2526
02:05:49,681 --> 02:05:51,630
that,
I'm often annoyed because I'd be telling

2527
02:05:51,631 --> 02:05:52,464
my family members as far as I'm 
concerned for like half an hour 

2528
02:05:54,631 --> 02:05:56,970
desperately to wake me up and they'd 
been ignoring me.

2529
02:05:57,240 --> 02:05:58,073
Of course it's probably only taken five 
minutes and they don't have any idea 

2530
02:06:00,421 --> 02:06:03,180
what's going on.
But it often,

2531
02:06:03,450 --> 02:06:07,680
I think it has something to do with 
Sarah synergic malfunction and it's that

2532
02:06:07,681 --> 02:06:10,080
might be related to this mood disorder 
that I described,

2533
02:06:10,081 --> 02:06:10,914
but,
but it's also much more likely to occur 

2534
02:06:12,721 --> 02:06:15,240
if you lay on your back and sleep on 
your back.

2535
02:06:15,241 --> 02:06:17,400
And also if you do it in the afternoon,
so,

2536
02:06:17,780 --> 02:06:18,613
um,
and people can have quite horrifying 

2537
02:06:19,711 --> 02:06:21,330
experiences with sleep paralysis.

2538
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:23,010
There's a good book called the,
uh,

2539
02:06:23,250 --> 02:06:24,083
the terror that comes in the night about
sleep paralysis and nightmares and it's 

2540
02:06:29,521 --> 02:06:31,950
quite an interesting investigation into 
that phenomena.

2541
02:06:31,951 --> 02:06:33,420
So,
um,

2542
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:35,933
oh,
your essay writing guidance has proven 

2543
02:06:37,231 --> 02:06:38,250
invaluable.
Well,

2544
02:06:38,251 --> 02:06:40,410
thank you that that refers to that 
thing,

2545
02:06:40,550 --> 02:06:41,383
that writing exercise that you can find 
on my psychiatry psychology for 30 

2546
02:06:44,791 --> 02:06:45,624
website.
I'll try to find a better place to put 

2547
02:06:47,221 --> 02:06:48,400
it.
Um,

2548
02:06:48,630 --> 02:06:51,450
maybe I'll tweet about it again.
I'm glad it's invaluable.

2549
02:06:51,470 --> 02:06:53,550
It's taken a long time to figure out how
to write it.

2550
02:06:53,551 --> 02:06:55,980
Do you have any guidance round taking 
notes from books and lectures?

2551
02:06:55,981 --> 02:06:56,431
Yeah,
yeah,

2552
02:06:56,431 --> 02:06:57,264
no problem.
Like don't be taking notes during the 

2553
02:07:00,691 --> 02:07:01,950
lecture.
Exactly.

2554
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:04,470
Because then you're not listening to the
lecture.

2555
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:08,190
It's like listen to the lecture and then
take notes afterwards.

2556
02:07:08,191 --> 02:07:09,780
Now that doesn't work for every 
discipline,

2557
02:07:09,810 --> 02:07:10,643
but,
but it certainly works for disciplines 

2558
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:15,180
like students in my lectures,
I always tell them,

2559
02:07:15,181 --> 02:07:19,620
don't take notes during the lecture,
listen to the damn lecture.

2560
02:07:19,860 --> 02:07:20,693
You can take notes afterwards because 
what that does is force you to practice 

2561
02:07:23,611 --> 02:07:26,970
remembering.
And then with regards to books,

2562
02:07:26,971 --> 02:07:30,690
it's like read,
don't highlight,

2563
02:07:30,780 --> 02:07:33,930
don't underline like that.
I think that that's just rubbish.

2564
02:07:33,931 --> 02:07:38,070
I think it's pseudo read a couple of 
paragraphs or maybe an essay,

2565
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:40,570
something like that.
Depending on the density of the book.

2566
02:07:40,690 --> 02:07:42,460
Close the book,
think about it.

2567
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:45,820
Write down what you're thinking,
write down what you remember.

2568
02:07:45,850 --> 02:07:46,683
But,
but,

2569
02:07:46,810 --> 02:07:51,640
but in the context of what you're 
thinking about because that instantiates

2570
02:07:51,641 --> 02:07:54,190
it into your memory and give and puts it
at hand.

2571
02:07:54,191 --> 02:07:55,024
Like people ask me for example,
how it is that I can remember all the 

2572
02:07:57,671 --> 02:08:00,490
things that I talk about 
extemporaneously when I'm lecturing.

2573
02:08:00,491 --> 02:08:04,300
And the reason for that is because I've 
thought them through,

2574
02:08:04,810 --> 02:08:06,280
you know,
I read them and I think,

2575
02:08:06,281 --> 02:08:06,851
oh,
okay,

2576
02:08:06,851 --> 02:08:08,560
well that's an interesting idea.

2577
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:12,220
How does it relate to all these other 
ideas that I know?

2578
02:08:12,640 --> 02:08:13,251
Like,
what is it,

2579
02:08:13,251 --> 02:08:14,084
significance for this idea and what's 
its significance for this idea and do I 

2580
02:08:16,781 --> 02:08:18,670
believe it and how my,
I criticize it.

2581
02:08:18,700 --> 02:08:19,533
So it's Kinda like I'm,
I'm attaching little memory hooks to it 

2582
02:08:22,810 --> 02:08:25,180
in,
in five different ways and then I've got

2583
02:08:25,181 --> 02:08:26,410
it.
It's part of me.

2584
02:08:26,650 --> 02:08:30,250
And that seems to be part of recall 
rather than,

2585
02:08:30,550 --> 02:08:31,383
so rather than recognition and recall is
the spontaneous act of remembering 

2586
02:08:36,791 --> 02:08:39,400
something complex.
And when you recall something,

2587
02:08:39,401 --> 02:08:43,210
you're actually practicing remembering 
it and that's what you need to do if you

2588
02:08:43,211 --> 02:08:48,211
want that to be part of you.
So I would say separate out the function

2589
02:08:48,761 --> 02:08:51,280
of reading and note taking.
So read,

2590
02:08:51,370 --> 02:08:54,700
think,
write or read.

2591
02:08:54,701 --> 02:08:55,990
Write.
Think though,

2592
02:08:56,050 --> 02:08:59,710
because the last two things are quite 
similar but don't like read the book and

2593
02:08:59,711 --> 02:09:02,800
then read a sentence and then write down
that sentence.

2594
02:09:02,801 --> 02:09:05,860
That's not helpful.
You could read the sentence,

2595
02:09:05,861 --> 02:09:06,694
close the book and then reformulate the 
sentence so that now it's your sentence 

2596
02:09:09,581 --> 02:09:10,780
man.
Then you'll remember it.

2597
02:09:10,781 --> 02:09:12,820
Then you'll understand it.
That works really well.

2598
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:14,193
What a postmodernist have right?
There is an infinite number of ways to 

2599
02:09:17,051 --> 02:09:18,010
perceive the world.

2600
02:09:18,830 --> 02:09:19,410
Yeah.

2601
02:09:19,410 --> 02:09:20,430
That's what they had.
Right.

2602
02:09:20,431 --> 02:09:21,264
And that's bloody major discovery.
It was the same discovery that blew the 

2603
02:09:24,661 --> 02:09:28,860
slats out of artificial intelligence in 
its early instantiation in the 1960s.

2604
02:09:29,130 --> 02:09:29,963
So the idea that the world is so complex
that there is in principle in infinite 

2605
02:09:34,171 --> 02:09:35,970
number of ways to perceive it is 
correct,

2606
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:37,553
but the idea that there is no order of 
rank difference between those modes of 

2607
02:09:41,641 --> 02:09:42,840
perception,
that's just,

2608
02:09:43,160 --> 02:09:45,750
that's where the postmodernist went 
completely off the rails.

2609
02:09:46,110 --> 02:09:47,700
So they just,
they,

2610
02:09:47,850 --> 02:09:48,683
they got the problem right.
But they didn't take their thinking 

2611
02:09:50,491 --> 02:09:52,290
about it nearly far enough.
So,

2612
02:09:53,020 --> 02:09:55,650
um,
okay.

2613
02:09:55,651 --> 02:09:56,484
Let's say you mentioned switching to a 
Paleo Diet some time ago and from the 

2614
02:09:59,371 --> 02:10:01,140
way your physical appearance seems to 
improve,

2615
02:10:01,170 --> 02:10:02,003
I would say it's working quite well.
Could we have more details into your 

2616
02:10:04,471 --> 02:10:05,700
diet?
Yeah,

2617
02:10:07,150 --> 02:10:08,700
you could.
Um,

2618
02:10:08,830 --> 02:10:11,920
for a year and a half I basically 
haven't eaten any carbohydrates,

2619
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:14,990
so I wouldn't recommend it though cause 
it's really not it,

2620
02:10:15,310 --> 02:10:19,270
it's hard and it also makes you 
unpopular.

2621
02:10:19,330 --> 02:10:20,163
I can't really go to restaurants.
It's very difficult for me to go to 

2622
02:10:22,300 --> 02:10:24,530
other people's places to eat.
Um,

2623
02:10:24,580 --> 02:10:27,110
it makes traveling a real pain.
Um,

2624
02:10:27,550 --> 02:10:29,230
but I'll tell you if you want to lose 
weight,

2625
02:10:29,231 --> 02:10:32,110
man,
and that is really why I did this by the

2626
02:10:32,111 --> 02:10:33,890
way,
but if you want to lose weight,

2627
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:39,280
if you cut carbohydrates out of your 
diet and go on a paleo diet,

2628
02:10:39,770 --> 02:10:40,603
heavy protein and Greens and that sort 
of thing and you can eat a lot of that 

2629
02:10:44,781 --> 02:10:47,610
so you don't have to be hungry.
My experience has been,

2630
02:10:47,611 --> 02:10:49,220
and you know,
it's not the same with everyone,

2631
02:10:49,221 --> 02:10:51,520
but I also know other people who've 
tried this out.

2632
02:10:51,530 --> 02:10:56,450
My brother in law who's actually quite a
great genius has he's 60 now and he's in

2633
02:10:56,451 --> 02:10:58,970
better shape than he was when he was in 
45 45.

2634
02:10:58,970 --> 02:11:01,460
He's a bloody monster.
That guy really tough,

2635
02:11:01,461 --> 02:11:03,470
really physically put together,
super smart.

2636
02:11:03,471 --> 02:11:04,304
And he's followed a Paleo Diet for about
15 years and like he doesn't have an 

2637
02:11:07,101 --> 02:11:10,010
ounce of fat on them.
So if you want to lose weight,

2638
02:11:10,550 --> 02:11:11,383
drop the carbs and you'll lose weight so
fast you won't believe it and you don't 

2639
02:11:14,631 --> 02:11:18,110
have to be hungry.
So I don't want to go into it more depth

2640
02:11:18,111 --> 02:11:21,590
because it's Jesus Christ.
I've spent so much time talking about my

2641
02:11:21,591 --> 02:11:24,950
bloody diet over the last year that it 
just bored me to death.

2642
02:11:25,490 --> 02:11:26,323
That's so funny because it's so funny 
because just before last September when 

2643
02:11:31,010 --> 02:11:31,843
I made those first videos,
I was sitting around for my family and 

2644
02:11:33,741 --> 02:11:34,574
we'd been talking about Diet God nonstop
because partly because of my daughter's 

2645
02:11:37,731 --> 02:11:38,564
health problems and elsa mine,
it's like every day discussion about 

2646
02:11:41,391 --> 02:11:42,224
diet.
And I was just paralyzing me and I 

2647
02:11:44,421 --> 02:11:45,021
thought,
God,

2648
02:11:45,021 --> 02:11:47,600
I hope,
I wish that we could find something else

2649
02:11:48,050 --> 02:11:50,090
to talk about.
It's like,

2650
02:11:50,091 --> 02:11:50,924
well that's your happened.
So what is your advice for people that 

2651
02:11:54,381 --> 02:11:56,930
aren't very social and have a hard time 
making friends?

2652
02:11:59,570 --> 02:12:01,250
Get the hell out there and practice,
man,

2653
02:12:02,420 --> 02:12:04,550
I had a client,
very introverted,

2654
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:08,300
very introverted person,
very badly served by her parents.

2655
02:12:08,340 --> 02:12:09,830
Uh,
not very well socialized,

2656
02:12:09,831 --> 02:12:10,664
extremely socially anxious,
awkward in her social interactions as 

2657
02:12:14,001 --> 02:12:15,200
well.
So not skilled.

2658
02:12:15,590 --> 02:12:18,500
Um,
she d and also alone,

2659
02:12:18,501 --> 02:12:21,680
she didn't have an intimate relationship
or really any family.

2660
02:12:21,740 --> 02:12:22,573
So quite,
quite isolated person and terrified of 

2661
02:12:24,321 --> 02:12:27,290
social interactions.
Like she couldn't even go out and have a

2662
02:12:27,291 --> 02:12:28,124
coffee with me as her therapists as a 
practice exercise when we first met and 

2663
02:12:31,881 --> 02:12:32,714
man,
she's made progress like you wouldn't 

2664
02:12:34,191 --> 02:12:37,130
believe like terror,
unbelievable progress.

2665
02:12:37,500 --> 02:12:38,420
Um,
you know,

2666
02:12:38,421 --> 02:12:42,080
doing public,
doing public appearances on stage,

2667
02:12:42,081 --> 02:12:44,120
even um,
gold.

2668
02:12:44,121 --> 02:12:46,310
Go take a,
go to toastmasters,

2669
02:12:46,370 --> 02:12:48,320
do some public speaking,
uh,

2670
02:12:49,340 --> 02:12:52,050
join meetup.com.
Um,

2671
02:12:52,580 --> 02:12:54,080
ask people questions.
You know,

2672
02:12:54,081 --> 02:12:56,520
that's a really good thing.
If you're not very social and,

2673
02:12:56,570 --> 02:12:57,403
and you'll get self conscious,
you start thinking about yourself and 

2674
02:13:00,381 --> 02:13:02,300
how stupid you are,
that's a really bad idea.

2675
02:13:03,050 --> 02:13:05,240
You should be paying attention to the 
other person.

2676
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:06,313
So if you get nervous,
it isn't that you have to stop being 

2677
02:13:09,651 --> 02:13:11,000
nervous because that isn't going to 
work.

2678
02:13:11,001 --> 02:13:13,520
What you have to do is start paying more
attention to the other person.

2679
02:13:13,521 --> 02:13:15,440
You have to force your attention 
outward.

2680
02:13:15,740 --> 02:13:17,720
And you know,
you can ask people questions,

2681
02:13:17,721 --> 02:13:18,554
listen to them.
And when they say something interesting 

2682
02:13:21,051 --> 02:13:22,820
or they say something you don't 
understand,

2683
02:13:22,910 --> 02:13:23,743
ask them a question.
And people love that man because they 

2684
02:13:26,691 --> 02:13:29,120
know you're listening to them and people
love being listened to.

2685
02:13:29,390 --> 02:13:30,223
So if you're learn to listen better and 
learn to ask questions and there's no 

2686
02:13:36,961 --> 02:13:39,180
stupid questions if you're paying 
attention,

2687
02:13:40,110 --> 02:13:40,943
right?
And so you don't have to worry about 

2688
02:13:41,671 --> 02:13:43,260
that.
If you don't know something,

2689
02:13:43,740 --> 02:13:44,573
if you don't know something and you ask 
an honest question and someone treats 

2690
02:13:46,771 --> 02:13:47,604
you badly because of it,
then you should just go away from that 

2691
02:13:49,471 --> 02:13:51,120
person because they don't have a clue.

2692
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:54,530
So get out there,
um,

2693
02:13:54,630 --> 02:13:57,960
forget about trying to not be nervous 
because you're going to be nervous.

2694
02:13:57,961 --> 02:14:00,690
But when you're nervous,
pay more attention to other people.

2695
02:14:00,930 --> 02:14:03,360
Listen to them carefully.
Watch them,

2696
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:04,793
because then your natural social 
abilities will kick in and ask them 

2697
02:14:08,130 --> 02:14:10,050
questions.
And you know,

2698
02:14:10,110 --> 02:14:10,943
your assuming it'll take you three or 
four years to get decently good at it 

2699
02:14:13,620 --> 02:14:15,180
and that you'll really have to work at 
it.

2700
02:14:15,510 --> 02:14:16,650
But it's worth it,
man.

2701
02:14:16,651 --> 02:14:19,290
So,
so just go out there and do it and,

2702
02:14:19,380 --> 02:14:20,580
and you'll,
you'll figure it out.

2703
02:14:20,640 --> 02:14:25,640
You'll figure it out.
So all right guys and girls and,

2704
02:14:26,910 --> 02:14:30,900
and assorted others.
It's nine 30 and uh,

2705
02:14:31,770 --> 02:14:34,200
well that was fun.
I hope it was fun for you.

2706
02:14:34,230 --> 02:14:36,990
And I would like to say in closing two 
things.

2707
02:14:37,050 --> 02:14:39,900
Number one,
thank you very much for the,

2708
02:14:39,930 --> 02:14:42,360
not just for the monetary support,
you know,

2709
02:14:42,361 --> 02:14:45,000
although I hope to put that to good use.
I,

2710
02:14:45,100 --> 02:14:45,933
that is definitely my plan.
But also the public support I've 

2711
02:14:49,381 --> 02:14:54,381
received has been extremely practically 
and psychologically useful to me.

2712
02:14:55,350 --> 02:14:58,680
You know,
because there was a lot of stress in the

2713
02:14:58,680 --> 02:14:59,513
last year and,

2714
02:15:01,550 --> 02:15:05,710
and my job was definitely in danger at 
the University of Toronto.

2715
02:15:05,711 --> 02:15:07,820
It's certainly my autonomy as a 
professor was,

2716
02:15:08,060 --> 02:15:08,893
and the fact that I received all this 
public support was extraordinarily 

2717
02:15:14,361 --> 02:15:15,194
useful for me to buttress my sense that 
I was pursuing the right course of 

2718
02:15:20,271 --> 02:15:22,700
action even though I wasn't doing it 
perfectly.

2719
02:15:23,240 --> 02:15:25,460
And it was,
it was very,

2720
02:15:25,850 --> 02:15:29,300
it helped me protect myself to a great 
degree practically.

2721
02:15:29,301 --> 02:15:30,134
I mean,
part of the reason that university had 

2722
02:15:31,401 --> 02:15:32,234
the,
let's call it the opportunity to back 

2723
02:15:34,191 --> 02:15:35,024
off in,
in the face of all the objections that 

2724
02:15:37,401 --> 02:15:38,234
were raised by the social justice 
warrior types is because there was a 

2725
02:15:40,551 --> 02:15:44,750
counter protest from the general public.
And so thank you very much for that.

2726
02:15:44,751 --> 02:15:48,170
It's much appreciated.
And with regards to the money man,

2727
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:49,273
like my,
my plan is to while a to remain very 

2728
02:15:52,221 --> 02:15:54,140
grateful for it and not to take it for 
granted,

2729
02:15:54,141 --> 02:15:54,974
but the man,
I'm going to try to do some viciously 

2730
02:15:56,721 --> 02:15:58,790
good things with that.
So,

2731
02:15:59,090 --> 02:16:04,070
and uh,
I freed up my time for the next year and

2732
02:16:04,430 --> 02:16:08,360
I want to capitalize on this.
I want to capitalize on this opportunity

2733
02:16:08,361 --> 02:16:09,194
and I want to bring classical humanities
education to millions of people and 

2734
02:16:12,351 --> 02:16:13,850
Jesus,
that's such a good deal.

2735
02:16:14,120 --> 02:16:15,620
So,
um,

2736
02:16:17,200 --> 02:16:19,390
so thanks very much.
It's very much appreciated.

2737
02:16:19,630 --> 02:16:20,463
So we'll talk to you again soon and I 
hope you enjoyed the q and a and 

2738
02:16:25,390 --> 02:16:28,110
tonight.
Oh,

2739
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:30,633
oh.
And I'd like to thank my son Julian 

2740
02:16:32,050 --> 02:16:32,883
because he's helped me set up all this 
technology and that's been really good 

2741
02:16:35,081 --> 02:16:35,914
of him.
And,

2742
02:16:35,980 --> 02:16:37,870
and,
and it worked.

2743
02:16:37,930 --> 02:16:40,690
So parade for that.
Bye.

2744
02:16:40,691 --> 02:16:45,691
Bye.
Now I have to figure it out.

2745
02:16:53,321 --> 02:16:58,321
I shut this off.
First blank shot

2746
02:17:11,850 --> 02:17:14,550
then done.
Bye.

2747
02:17:14,551 --> 02:17:15,384
Bye.
