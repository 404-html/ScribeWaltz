1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,813
How's you know,
Freud believed that a substantial 

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,063
proportion of the symptoms he saw among 
his clients were of psychological 

3
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:12,534
origin,
despite the fact that some of them are 

4
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:16,190
manifest physically.
Uh,

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,120
these things do happen by the way.
Uh,

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,900
I had a client who was from eastern 
Europe from eastern and Eastern European

7
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:24,924
background,
which is relevant in that I believe her 

8
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:28,854
upbringing to be more similar to the 
kind of upbringing that the victorians 

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,650
that Freud studied were then say more 
the people of people in the West.

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,250
And she had the same thing that her 
grandmother had,

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,520
which was,
um,

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,613
psychosomatic epilepsy.
And so she expressed what we're often 

13
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:54,450
sexual conflicts through epileptic 
seizures.

14
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,230
She had an epileptic seizure of this 
type in my lab,

15
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,510
my office one day.
And uh,

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,600
you know,
she was unsure whether they were real or

17
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:04,434
not,
but I've seen people have epileptic 

18
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:07,530
seizures.

19
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,180
And as a general rule it's quite 
upsetting.

20
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:10,980
But she had an epileptic seizure in my 
office.

21
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:13,320
And one of the things I noted was that 
it didn't really bother me.

22
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,280
And one of the things I've noticed about
being a therapist is if someone is,

23
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,370
is manifesting a lot of emotion and a,
it's not bothering me,

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,170
then it's a good hint that there's 
something wrong,

25
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:26,004
that it's not real.
There's something about it that isn't 

26
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:28,284
exactly right because it doesn't seem to
hook in your MPA empathic systems the 

27
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,580
same way.
So,

28
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,980
um,
I had another client.

29
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,830
This has actually happened to two of my 
clients.

30
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,073
The first one was attacked by her 
boyfriend and she was unbelievably 

31
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,200
naive.
She was so naive.

32
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,053
You like,
you could write a whole book about how 

33
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:49,800
naive she was.
I'm serious.

34
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:52,110
It was unbelievable.
Her parents actually taught her.

35
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,610
This is the literal truth.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,460
Her parents taught her that adults were 
angels.

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,680
It's not a good way of preparing your 
child for the grown up world.

38
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,640
Anyways,
she'd had a fight with her boyfriend and

39
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:10,641
he attacked her with sexual intent.
And when we went through this and it was

40
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:16,080
under hypnosis,
she described his face.

41
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:18,420
She said he had a look of sheer 
malevolence,

42
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:18,781
right?
He,

43
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:21,210
she'd never seen that.
She was like a 28 year old woman.

44
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:22,230
She was a,
she had a,

45
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,480
she had an undergraduate degree,
she was no idiot.

46
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,490
Um,
I asked her like,

47
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:27,324
how can you reconcile your belief that 
adults were angels with all the things 

48
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:32,610
that you learned about history and your 
undergraduate degree?

49
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,720
And she basically said,
well,

50
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:36,780
I just put those things in a compartment
and didn't pay any attention to them.

51
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,070
It's like,
yeah,

52
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:38,904
okay.
So she saw this guy's face when he was 

53
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:41,784
intending harm and it was actually the 
look on his face that traumatized her 

54
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:50,100
and it traumatized her so badly that she
had severe psychosomatic symptoms severe

55
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:50,934
enough to get her diagnosed as 
schizophrenia for five years nonstop at 

56
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:56,340
night for four hours at a time.

57
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,860
And the symptoms were that her whole 
body would shake and she would be unable

58
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:01,870
to sleep.
So.

59
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,320
And I had another client who had the 
same thing,

60
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,303
not the same thing,
but a similar thing happened to her in 

61
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:13,141
high school where a boy was picking on 
her continually with malevolent intent.

62
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:18,421
And the thing that really made that 
memory stick in her face was the look of

63
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:22,150
malevolence on his face.
So.

64
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,333
So you see some people are definitely 
capable of some behavior that is most 

65
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:33,100
properly explained as far as I can tell 
in terms that are similar to Freud's,

66
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,230
what's repressed,
unbearable memories,

67
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:36,064
often sexual and impermissible desires.
How do you defend against things that 

68
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:43,630
you don't want to be true?
While there's repression,

69
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:45,490
Freud really thought that was 
unconscious.

70
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,773
People didn't know they were repressing.
So I sent you guys a link you may have 

71
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:52,270
noticed about the Gottman studies on 
married couples.

72
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,370
I think there are still.
Studies are bloody brilliant,

73
00:03:54,371 --> 00:03:57,670
you know,
and what Godman found in exactly typical

74
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:58,504
is that the couples who are going to get
divorced when you see them in their 

75
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:03,070
natural habitat,
they're all nice to each other,

76
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:07,120
but they're psychophysiological systems 
are just going preserved there like prey

77
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,370
and Predator to each other.
You know,

78
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:10,204
and you know,
I don't know if that's repression or if 

79
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:13,024
it's suppression.
These things are very difficult to 

80
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:16,990
distinguish because they're not that 
well defined but.

81
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,020
But there is a lot of activity beneath 
the surface,

82
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:20,854
that's for sure.
And the problem with being 

83
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:22,504
psychophysiology logically aroused like 
that is that the consequences of that 

84
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:27,580
overtime is physical,
right?

85
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,683
Because what's happens when you're 
aroused like that as you produce a lot 

86
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:34,090
of the stress hormone cortisol and that 
activates the general stress response.

87
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,193
And the General Stress Response 
Basically Robs your future stores of 

88
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:43,150
energy and ability to overreact in the 
present.

89
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,000
And if you do that long enough,
well you'll damage your brain.

90
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:46,834
That's one of the things that happens.
But there's many other things that 

91
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:51,880
happened too.
So denial people will just say,

92
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:52,960
well,
that's not so bad,

93
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:53,794
or maybe that's normal.
We'll see a lot of that when I show you 

94
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:57,490
this movie reaction formation,
which is,

95
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,300
it's like,
it's,

96
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,470
it's overcompensation in some sense.
So maybe you really hate your sister and

97
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:04,150
you buy her a great big Christmas 
present,

98
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:04,984
you know,
because you'd like to think that you 

99
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:05,981
like,
or.

100
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:08,150
But really you don't like her at all.
Um,

101
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,560
they're often sibling rivalry can be 
unbelievably intense.

102
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,140
Um,
displacement.

103
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,240
This is a good one.
My boss yells at me,

104
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:18,760
I yell at my husband,
my husband yells at the baby,

105
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,720
the baby bites the cat,
you know,

106
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,680
so it's a cascading chain of,
of emotion.

107
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,700
Often I find with people though that if 
they come home and they're in a bad mood

108
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,070
and they're touchy,
you know,

109
00:05:29,071 --> 00:05:29,904
and,
and you,

110
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,840
you say something to them and you know,
they,

111
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:33,130
they fly off the handle.

112
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,640
It isn't exactly so much that they've 
suppressed or repressed or denied what's

113
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:41,110
happening at work.
At least not in any obvious sense.

114
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,273
Not that day.
Often you have to like prior around in 

115
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:48,460
the person and talk to them and harass 
them a bit until they,

116
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,100
you know,
often tell emotion arises,

117
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:55,240
which is partly why Freud thought about 
his transformation processes Cathartic.

118
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,080
And then they figure out.
They'll cry and say,

119
00:05:57,081 --> 00:06:00,320
well,
I'm really upset at my boss.

120
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,633
And the.
It's not obvious that the person 

121
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:03,284
actually knew that when they came home 
and like the unconscious issue is quite 

122
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,440
a difficult one to,
to tear apart.

123
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,303
My conclusion has been that when people 
that repression isn't really much 

124
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:15,854
different than lying except that
the lie is initially conscious when you 

125
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,034
first make,
but if you keep habitually lying about 

126
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:25,514
something,
you develop a little automated circuit 

127
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,243
that either does the lying or that has 
the replacement story at hand and after 

128
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,233
200 repetitions at the same damn lie,
you've built a little machine in your 

129
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:36,764
head that handles all that and at that 
point it can be unconscious because you 

130
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:40,430
don't need it.

131
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,680
You don't need to be conscious to make 
that decision anymore.

132
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:45,770
So if you practice something deceptive 
long enough,

133
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:47,870
I think it becomes habitual and 
unconscious.

134
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,793
So I would recommend that you don't do 
that unless you want your head full of 

135
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:53,900
little pathological monsters that you 
can't control.

136
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,670
I mean,
maybe it's already like that.

137
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,103
That would be a freudian idea.
Identification is another defense 

138
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:02,060
mechanism.
You're bullied.

139
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,660
You want to become the bully 
rationalization.

140
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:06,980
That's when you don't actually.
This is.

141
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:09,560
This is the thing that people who are 
highly intelligent,

142
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:10,394
they're really good at,
you know they've got a problem and they 

143
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:15,494
come up with some perfectly coherent and
reasonable explanation for the problem 

144
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:19,724
or the misbehavior.
That has absolutely nothing to do with 

145
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:23,000
what's actually going on.
And if you.

146
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,890
If you marry someone,
for example,

147
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:28,130
who's more introverted than you or less 
verbally fluent,

148
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:28,964
this is something to really watch out 
for it because just because you could 

149
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:34,610
win an argument with someone doesn't 
mean you're right and if you're verbally

150
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:37,370
fluent and extroverted,
you can often tie people up in knots.

151
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,443
But I would say beware of that because 
just because the person you're arguing 

152
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:42,074
with can't formulate their ideas as fast
as you and just because they may not be 

153
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:48,530
able to hold their own in an argument 
with you.

154
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,990
That does not mean they don't know what 
they see.

155
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,930
And if you have any intelligence and 
you're married to someone like that,

156
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:54,764
you actually try to coax what they think
out of them and help them articulate it 

157
00:07:58,221 --> 00:07:59,054
and formulate it.
Because there's always the possibility 

158
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:01,514
that you're doing something underhanded 
and sneaky and dangerous in the medium 

159
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:05,264
to longterm,
and it might be better for both of you 

160
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:09,240
if you figured it out intellectually 
ization.

161
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,263
Well,
if you've ever watched a woody allen 

162
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:12,050
movie,
you know what that is,

163
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,720
um,
what are,

164
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,040
y'all should have had union 
psychotherapy,

165
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,680
not Freud in psychotherapy because he's 
a creative person.

166
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:19,514
And one of the things I've noticed is 
that I have clients who are very 

167
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:23,174
creative and other clients who aren't as
creative and the ones who were creative 

168
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,163
spontaneously manifest processes in 
their dreams that are most easily 

169
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,020
interpreted in union form.

170
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,750
It doesn't seem to be the case for 
people that weren't creative though.

171
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:40,160
And if I talk to them about mythological
or symbol like ideas,

172
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,113
it doesn't click for them.
So what we usually do things that are 

173
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:44,144
much more practical.
What much more like behavior therapy 

174
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,010
projection is a good one.
I'm not irritated.

175
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:50,660
Your irritating,
you know,

176
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:51,380
and it's,
it's,

177
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,780
it's a toss up often because,
you know,

178
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,531
you might think,
well,

179
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:56,550
no one can irritate you without your 
permission.

180
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:57,780
It's like,
believe me,

181
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,673
if you think that you've not been around
some world class irritating people 

182
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:04,710
because there are certainly people,
borderline personalities are like that,

183
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,544
who I don't care if you're a safe man,
sooner or later you're going to get 

184
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:11,460
irritated because that's actually the 
goal of the behavior in large part.

185
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,683
So
Freud's fundamental theory was that 

186
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:16,854
unconscious ideas were at the core of 
many psychological conflicts like 

187
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:20,970
incomprehensible distress.

188
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,250
Psychosomatic symptoms are 
psychosomatic.

189
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,143
Cyst is when your body attempts to 
represent something that you're 

190
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:29,280
repressing.
Now.

191
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:32,010
I think there's two ways of looking at 
that because I don't actually think.

192
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,170
I don't always think that's what 
happens.

193
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,243
I think sometimes the reaction to the 
situation in question is actually 

194
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,124
sematic to begin with,
and then if it's articulated and worked 

195
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:46,440
out,
the body can can.

196
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:50,540
It's like the memory locale shifts or 
the representation area shifts.

197
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,960
So for example,
I had a client,

198
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,240
she had a wonderful time.
She,

199
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,403
she got fired from her job and they 
bundled her into her car and it was 

200
00:09:57,841 --> 00:09:58,674
sudden she didn't see it coming and then
on the way home her car was hit by 

201
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:01,734
another car.
So like that was a perfect way to be 

202
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:07,350
traumatized because she was already 
really upset and on edge obviously,

203
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:08,184
and then this car hit her at about 50 
miles an hour and it hurt her quite 

204
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:11,454
badly and she had minimal brain injury,
which is a really rough one because it 

205
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:19,680
has non specific symptoms and like she,
she,

206
00:10:19,681 --> 00:10:23,340
she'd come to therapy and I,
I talked to her for her ideas were quite

207
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:24,174
fragmented so it took us quite a long 
time to kind of weave a coherent story 

208
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:28,500
together.

209
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,110
But she'd sit there like this,
you know,

210
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,093
and one of the things that I found after
a while when I was working with her was 

211
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:35,604
that I was really uncomfortable watching
her and it was a discomfort that seemed 

212
00:10:39,441 --> 00:10:42,600
to center about here.
It was a physiological response,

213
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,470
probably a mirroring response.
And one day I said to her,

214
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:48,570
it was like a spontaneous impulse.
I said,

215
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,700
come over.
We'd worked together for a long time.

216
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:52,260
By the time said,
look,

217
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:55,140
come over here.
I'm leaning on the desk.

218
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:55,974
So I had her lean on the desk and then I
sort of pounded on her shoulders down 

219
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,363
down her spine and she started to cry 
and she cried like for 45 minutes and 

220
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:05,490
then that loosened up a shoulder and 
then we.

221
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,760
Another thing we did was to.
I had her,

222
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:10,560
she said she couldn't lift her arm a.

223
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,870
So we were doing basically exposure.
I said,

224
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:13,704
okay,
lift your arm and then let it go and 

225
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:16,314
then lift your arm another inch and let 
it go and then lift your arm another 

226
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:22,320
inch and let it go.
And soon we had her arm up like this.

227
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,273
She had moved her arm above her head in 
like five years because she was in this 

228
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:30,930
like protective crouch.
It's like a startle response and I think

229
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:31,764
that if you're traumatized,
often what happens is your body throws 

230
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:38,400
itself into a state of hyper preparation
and then unless you can,

231
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,650
unless you can bring the meaning of the 
traumatic event up and articulate it and

232
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,480
throw away what it isn't,
you know,

233
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:49,314
like.
Because when she got hit by the car and 

234
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:52,380
lost her job,
part of her idea was,

235
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:53,710
well,
my life is over now,

236
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,573
you know,
because you can understand why someone 

237
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:56,644
would think that.

238
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,270
So I would say,
well,

239
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,890
yes,
that's understandable,

240
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:04,600
but it's too global and vague 
formulation to be helpful,

241
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,940
but if your life is over and there's 
nothing you can do,

242
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,850
this is probably the right thing to do.
You know?

243
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:10,684
And so sometimes it's not so much that 
the simplest sematic symptoms are a 

244
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:16,000
consequence of repression and then 
symbolic,

245
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,103
symbolic representation,
it's that the actual response to the 

246
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:23,620
event starts out physiological and it 
never gets any farther than that.

247
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,830
And so partly what you're doing is,
and I think it's,

248
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:29,530
it's like a permanent manifestation of 
the stress response.

249
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:30,364
So he thought of behavior anomalies in 
this way and hallucinations and 

250
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:34,474
delusions.
Like a lot of this stuff is dead on as 

251
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:39,040
far as I'm concerned.
Like you see this,

252
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,630
you see this a lot with people that you 
have an intimate relationship with.

253
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:44,464
You know,
like there's something off about what 

254
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:46,780
they're doing.

255
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,620
Well,
for example,

256
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:49,210
in the gottman study,
that's a good example.

257
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:50,044
You know how Gottman said I'm the 
successful couples have responded to 

258
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:55,120
each other's bids,
right?

259
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:56,900
So if,
if you're in the house and your,

260
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,620
your wife says,
um,

261
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,841
oh look,
there's a,

262
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:02,110
there's a cardinal in the backyard and 
it's really pretty,

263
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,973
you know what that means is maybe you 
could come over here and look at this 

264
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:06,664
bird with me and you know,
that would help me understand that you 

265
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,510
liked me and they're interested in what 
I'm doing,

266
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,120
you know.
And so you can say in Gottman's terms,

267
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:13,954
you can just say,
I don't want to look at your stupid 

268
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,010
bird.
That's not a great response.

269
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,820
Or you can say really,
okay,

270
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,523
you put down your newspaper,
whatever it is and look like you're 

271
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,380
really perturbed and then you walk over 
there and no,

272
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,263
that's a good response to because then 
you can also destroy her pleasure and 

273
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:31,330
looking at the bird.

274
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,760
So without really looking like a son of 
a bitch.

275
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:36,490
So that's a good one.
Or you can just sort of see.

276
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:39,040
I love that one.
Which means,

277
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,240
oh,
you're annoying.

278
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:41,590
I'm so put upon,
I really,

279
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,483
you're always asking me to do stupid 
things and I'm so generous and giving 

280
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,253
and here you are exploiting me again and
then you go over and you look at the 

281
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,951
burden,
you know,

282
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:54,610
maybe a smile with your mouth but not 
your eyes and that's real nice.

283
00:13:54,611 --> 00:13:55,444
And then the other one is,
well you go over there like civilized 

284
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:59,830
human being,
like interacting with someone that you'd

285
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:01,990
actually like to get along with for the 
next 30 years.

286
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:04,450
But the things in all those other three 
categories,

287
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:08,350
those are,
there is like just in that Psi,

288
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,350
there's a whole bloody massive snakes 
underneath it.

289
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,184
You know.
And if you,

290
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,330
if you watch someone who does that and 
you go after them,

291
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,193
you know,
if you decide you're going to solve 

292
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,890
this,
you have to dig down into that side.

293
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,950
Like God only knows how deep it might be
a decade old,

294
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:25,840
you know,
they're harboring some bloody resentment

295
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:30,270
that occurred like 15 years ago is those
things are just stacked up like,

296
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,660
like little bombs underneath the surface
of this little tiny behavioral auction.

297
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,060
You know?
And usually people will just ignore it,

298
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,600
which is not a good idea,
but because they're conflict avoidant,

299
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:41,434
people are very,
very conflict avoidant and they like to 

300
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:44,081
think that,
well,

301
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:45,790
if everything's just all right right 
now,

302
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,740
it'll stay all right into the future.
It's like,

303
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:48,574
no,
it won't,

304
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,563
it absolutely will not.
And if you don't deal with little 

305
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:53,900
things,
then all the monsters that are packed up

306
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:56,090
inside the will eventually eat you.
So,

307
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:56,924
but that's a while in the future.
So you don't really have to worry about 

308
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:00,140
it.
It's not a very good,

309
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,820
a good way of thinking about things.

310
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,103
Freud also noticed,
noticed that people make jokes about 

311
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:07,754
things that are often repressed.
And that's definitely the case if you 

312
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:10,964
watch a good comedian,
especially the ones that are a little 

313
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:13,934
bit more on the outrageous side,
what they're doing constantly is saying 

314
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,360
things that people don't want to believe
but know are true.

315
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,020
And so they'll reveal something that 
everybody knows and everybody will laugh

316
00:15:24,021 --> 00:15:25,250
because yeah,
we know that.

317
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:27,410
But you're not supposed to say it.
And um,

318
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,750
what's his name?
The Indian comic from.

319
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:30,981
Yeah.
Yeah,

320
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:31,731
that's the guy.
I mean,

321
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,290
he's always making racial jokes,
right?

322
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,480
So funny because it's,
this whole audience is full of,

323
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:36,314
it's really,
really racially and ethnically mixed 

324
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,563
mixed audience and all he does is pick 
out people in like assault them for 

325
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:45,230
their race or ethnic identity and 
they're all laughing way like,

326
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:47,000
oh,
it's so cute that we're all in here like

327
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:49,520
insulting each other and,
but you know,

328
00:15:49,521 --> 00:15:50,480
he's,
he's,

329
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,660
he's giving voice to,
um,

330
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,990
what to commonly held stereotypes that 
no one will admit to holding or knowing.

331
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:03,260
And so it's kind of a relief to everyone
to have that broad out in the open,

332
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:04,094
in some safe place.
So slips of the tongue are also an 

333
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:08,054
interesting phenomena.
You can watch people very carefully for 

334
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:10,724
this because now and then they'll say 
something that means something other 

335
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:17,780
than what they thought it would say,
or it means something contrary or it's a

336
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:18,614
hint into one of these like stacks of 
monsters that normally they didn't want 

337
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:26,120
to admit to and you have to be sharp to,
to catch these things.

338
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:26,954
You have to pay real attention.
You can also see the same thing with 

339
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,404
micro-expressions,
often with people that's given rise to 

340
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:33,644
this whole new politically correct 
movement about suppressing 

341
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:36,644
microaggression,
which is like one of the most 

342
00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:40,490
pathological things I've ever heard of,
you know,

343
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,353
like getting rid of your micro 
aggression expressions that does not 

344
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:48,590
make you a good person just makes you a 
trickier sort of psychopath.

345
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:49,903
So Freud also was extremely interested 
in dreams and his theory was that a 

346
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:59,150
dream was a wish fulfillment and like I 
really don't think that's a good theory.

347
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,230
I think that sometimes some dreams have 
a wish like element,

348
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,303
although I should say,
even though I'm not very fond of the 

349
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:08,750
wish fulfillment theory,
I don't think it's comprehensive enough.

350
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,853
His,
the other things he had to say about 

351
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:13,520
dreams were absolutely brilliant.
So the,

352
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,980
his book,
if you want to read one book by Freud,

353
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:16,814
I would say the book on dreams is the 
best and unfortunately at the moment I 

354
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:23,210
can't remember what it's called,
the interpretation of dreams,

355
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:25,070
right?
It's a very thick book and you know,

356
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:27,860
it can't boil down Freud's theory of 
dreams.

357
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:29,840
It's a whole book into one phrase,
wish,

358
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:30,674
fulfillment,
you know he's way smarter than that and 

359
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:33,440
so you,
you don't,

360
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,810
for each writing is sort of like 
fiction.

361
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,880
You can't condense it.
You have to read it.

362
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,043
So you know,
sometimes it seems obvious like if the 

363
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:44,750
dream is of a sexual nature,
you can easily see whether that might be

364
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:45,490
a,
you know,

365
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,090
a wish fulfillment or something like 
that.

366
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:47,924
In hungry people will dream about food.
So it's not the case that and lonely 

367
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:54,660
people will dream about social comfort 
and so forth.

368
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:55,494
So it's not the case precisely that the 
dream can't have anything to do with 

369
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:00,510
wishes.
Jung's idea,

370
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:01,344
which I think is a better idea and I 
think it's more grounded in how we 

371
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:04,314
understand dreams in the modern world,
was that the dream was compensate Tory 

372
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,783
so that if you're,
if you had a particularly rigid 

373
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:11,784
viewpoint and in of the world and that 
rigid viewpoint was actually impeding 

374
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:15,924
your progress forward,
that the dream would spin up counter 

375
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:23,840
propositional fantasies in an attempt to
update the,

376
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:24,933
the,
the stiffening in the and the rigidity 

377
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:28,680
of the more explicit belief system.

378
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,513
And
I think there's some good evidence for 

379
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:35,010
that in modern studies of dreaming it 
seems.

380
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,490
It's certainly the case that dreams do 
seem to update your memory and our eyes.

381
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,370
I think partly what the dreams are doing
too,

382
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,980
and this is maybe where some of the 
symbolic content comes from,

383
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:46,680
is there's this,
you know,

384
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,910
it's not obvious how you should 
structure a category,

385
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:51,910
right?
Because categories,

386
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:52,890
they're very fluid,
you know,

387
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:55,620
you might think,
well all men is a good category,

388
00:18:55,621 --> 00:18:56,460
you know,
and then you might think,

389
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:57,294
well all white men and old non white men
is a good category depending on what 

390
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:02,130
you're discussing and so on,
you know,

391
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,993
the contents of your categories often 
depend on what you want to do with the 

392
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:07,224
category.
So it's not obvious what should be in 

393
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:11,550
the box and what should it be.
And partly what the dream is doing too,

394
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:14,130
is by loosening up the categorical 
structure,

395
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:14,964
you know,
because things can fluidly change and 

396
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:17,550
transform and dreams.

397
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:21,990
And it allows you to experiment with re 
categorization while you're asleep,

398
00:19:21,991 --> 00:19:25,290
without having to suffer the 
consequences of that in the waking world

399
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:26,124
because you're paralyzed right?
So I think it's more accurate to think 

400
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:29,184
of the dream as an,
as part of the process by which new 

401
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:36,060
knowledge becomes eventually articulated
and that's more of a union perspective.

402
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:36,894
So you start out not knowing anything 
about it and then maybe you can code it 

403
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:41,064
onto your behavior.
That would be something piaget would 

404
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:43,404
suggest.
And then after it's coated onto 

405
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:45,594
behavior,
maybe you can start expressing it in 

406
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:49,620
image,
especially in dynamic images.

407
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:50,454
And so that would be something like 
fiction and so you can think of dreams 

408
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:53,664
as a kind of fiction and then once 
you've got the thing laid out in 

409
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:58,260
fiction,
especially if it's kind of coherent,

410
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,950
then it's not a huge leap from that to 
having an articulated model.

411
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,993
And I think a lot of what you're doing 
when you do dream interpretation in 

412
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:05,934
psychotherapy is you're doing the same 
thing that you would do if you were 

413
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:10,470
interpreting literature.
Um,

414
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,910
and you know,
you think,

415
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:12,744
well,
is it worthwhile thinking about 

416
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:14,130
literature?
It's like,

417
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,210
well,
you know,

418
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,100
it's worthwhile reading it.
Fine.

419
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,590
Is it worthwhile thinking about what 
you're reading?

420
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,230
It's different process.
It's like arguably,

421
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,183
well,
so the dream has a function and it does 

422
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:25,404
whatever dreams do and then perhaps 
there's also some utility in attending 

423
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:32,760
to the dream consciously and trying to 
elaborate upon its contents.

424
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:35,460
And Freud would do that with Free 
Association and works.

425
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:36,870
It really works.
It's quite fun.

426
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,640
If you have someone who's a good 
dreamer,

427
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:39,241
you know,
you say,

428
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:39,830
okay,
they,

429
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,960
the way I do it as they are,
they tell me the dream,

430
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,110
they read it and I listened to it and I 
let my imagination work on it.

431
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,943
So it kind of builds up an association 
net and then I have them start from the 

432
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:53,434
beginning again and whenever they come 
to a theme or an object or something 

433
00:20:55,931 --> 00:20:58,870
like that that's identifiable,
then I asked them what that reminds them

434
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:02,950
up and so to me what we're doing is 
flushing out the association network and

435
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:03,784
that's a freudian idea.
And then if you walk through the whole 

436
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:09,490
dream like and then people will 
associate and then that will remind them

437
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:10,324
of something and then maybe they'll 
remember why a specific date is in the 

438
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:13,954
dream or something like that.
And so it's like the dream is putting 

439
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:17,734
together ideas that have a vague cloud 
around them and it's trying to sequence 

440
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:21,574
and organize them and you seem to be 
able to facilitate that process with 

441
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:26,860
conscious reflection.
So,

442
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,310
and for some people it's extremely 
useful.

443
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,890
I mean,
one of the things young said,

444
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:33,724
which I really liked was that if you're 
stuck in a problem and you can't solve 

445
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:38,200
it,
you have no idea how to solve a terrible

446
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:39,250
conflict of some sort.

447
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,880
You have to look where you don't know.
And he thought,

448
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:44,550
well,
one of the places that you don't know is

449
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,210
in your dreams and you think,
well,

450
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:47,044
dreams are doing something and there's 
good evidence that part of what dreams 

451
00:21:49,451 --> 00:21:51,850
are doing is dealing with novel 
information.

452
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,113
You know,
they're trying to conceptualize novel 

453
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:54,934
information.
And so that's a good place to look for 

454
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,003
new potential solutions because you can 
also think of the dream as part of a 

455
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:05,050
hypothesis generating mechanism that 
would also be the creative imagination.

456
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:08,710
So
I think often the reason,

457
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:09,544
I think maybe the reason that sometimes 
people remember dreams that are 

458
00:22:13,061 --> 00:22:13,894
extremely emotional and they feel 
compelled to tell them is perhaps is 

459
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:18,634
because the people who did that,
I think about it from an evolutionary 

460
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:22,474
perspective.
The people who did that and expose the 

461
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:25,324
fantasy to the group,
we're more likely to gather information 

462
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:31,720
about what it meant and possibly more 
likely to survive.

463
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,630
And so there seems to be a trigger 
level,

464
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:35,464
you know,
above which the dream is specifically 

465
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,550
particularly sufficiently emotionally 
impactful.

466
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:40,384
So the actually remember when you wake 
up and you would also often consider 

467
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:44,620
those big dreams,
you know,

468
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,573
especially if they had archetipal 
content and those would also sometimes 

469
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:52,330
be dreams that had relevance beyond the 
relevance to the specific individual.

470
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,493
So they might be dreams that are working
really hard on a problem that's 

471
00:22:56,111 --> 00:22:57,550
collective.
So,

472
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,451
and you know,
you think,

473
00:22:58,451 --> 00:23:00,790
well,
where do new ideas come from?

474
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,130
You know,
well they just appeared in my head.

475
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,950
It's like that's not a very good theory.
You know,

476
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,700
the idea has a birthplace,
the birthplace is in the unknown.

477
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,773
And then there's a tremendous amount of 
elaboration of that information before 

478
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:18,370
it ever gets up to where it pops into 
your head is an articulated statement,

479
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,580
you know,
that's not a,

480
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:24,490
that's not an instantaneous magical 
transformation or maybe you can think it

481
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:25,360
is,
but it's,

482
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,740
you know,
it's not a very useful theory.

483
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,790
And the idea that there are multiple 
stages of processing of information each

484
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:34,624
with their own natures much more in 
keeping with the way that modern people 

485
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:40,960
look at the brain,
which is as a Oregon that's evolved,

486
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:41,794
that has very,
very archaic elements like massively 

487
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:45,890
archaic,
like the ones I told you about that were

488
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,430
you share it with lobsters and then 
there's all sorts of weird systems built

489
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:53,060
on top of that that are basically there 
for biological purposes.

490
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:53,894
And then there's a cortical cap that 
sort of elaborates and all those things 

491
00:23:56,931 --> 00:24:01,040
are working together to extract out 
information that you can use for living.

492
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,790
It's certainly not mechanical.
It's not exactly computational.

493
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,120
It's,
it's a multistage process.

494
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:12,200
And dreams and imagination are involved 
at least at the hypothesis stage.

495
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,243
So.
So you can think of dream as a 

496
00:24:14,301 --> 00:24:17,540
hypothesis in some sense,
and although I don't think,

497
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,500
I don't think it's reasonable to say 
that dreams do one thing anymore than it

498
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,660
is reasonable to say that thinking does 
one thing,

499
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,033
but the competence Satori idea is a good
one and you can kind of think of the 

500
00:24:27,741 --> 00:24:29,690
wish fulfillment ideas,
that subset of that.

501
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,913
So the dream is also,
Freud says that process of regression 

502
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:35,234
that manifests itself simultaneously in 
three fashions as topical regression 

503
00:24:38,661 --> 00:24:39,494
from the conscious to the unconscious as
temporal regression from the present 

504
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:43,754
time to childhood.
Sometimes you see this with people 

505
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:48,370
who've had repetitive nightmares.
One thing I can tell you,

506
00:24:48,371 --> 00:24:50,660
you can try this.
If you have a repetitive nightmare,

507
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,830
usually it presents the same thematic 
problem over and over.

508
00:24:54,831 --> 00:24:57,770
Like maybe you're being chased by a 
monster when you turn around.

509
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,023
Um,
maybe your hands are tied or something 

510
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:01,680
like that.
You know,

511
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,560
which,
if you told me about that,

512
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:04,370
I think,
well,

513
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,590
who or what is tying your hands?
Right?

514
00:25:06,591 --> 00:25:09,500
That would be the first question,
but one of the things you can do to make

515
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:13,790
that nightmare go away is to sit down,
reimagine the nightmare,

516
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,653
and fix the ending.
Now you have to come up with a 

517
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:17,450
reasonable ending.

518
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,360
So for example,
I had a client who was afraid.

519
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,880
She had a cabin,
was very interesting case.

520
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,910
She had a mouse phobia and she was 
afraid mice would run up her leg.

521
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:26,744
That was the specific content of the 
phobia and she had a cabin and she 

522
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:31,190
didn't like to go to the cabin for two 
reasons.

523
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,203
One was a mouse might run up her leg and
the second was she was up there alone 

524
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:38,540
and she was afraid that she would get 
attacked and sexually assaulted.

525
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,403
So it doesn't take much of a frailty and
genius to figure out the connection 

526
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:42,554
between those two things.
But one of the things we did was first 

527
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:47,930
of all talk it through as if it was a 
reasonable fear.

528
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:48,441
It's like,
well,

529
00:25:48,441 --> 00:25:51,710
you are up there alone.
Maybe you could have an alarm system and

530
00:25:51,711 --> 00:25:53,000
some good locks.
It's like,

531
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:55,520
you know,
so your fear might be predicated on some

532
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,713
realistic,
some realistic appraisal which you're 

533
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,670
repressing,
you're not dealing with it.

534
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:05,300
It is potentially dangerous fix that.
Get a dog,

535
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:06,134
you know,
so we did all that and simultaneously 

536
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:09,884
treated or most phobia through 
behavioral exposure and then she was 

537
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:16,670
having these dreams of these guys 
breaking in and raping her and so we had

538
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:17,504
her walk through,
I think she bought a bat and put it by 

539
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:21,260
her bed,
which was something I suggested.

540
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:22,094
And then we walked her through.
I walked her through the dream and we 

541
00:26:25,641 --> 00:26:26,474
changed the ending.
So what she did was the guy climbed in 

542
00:26:27,981 --> 00:26:30,720
the window and she picked up the bat and
she smacked him one and then she sprayed

543
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:31,554
him with oven cleaner,
which is like a really nasty thing to 

544
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:34,034
do.
Then she tied him up in a chair and she 

545
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:36,014
was like,
she was dancing around in the office 

546
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:38,660
thinking that's,
you know,

547
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,790
that's a hero myth essentially.
Right?

548
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,863
We changed,
we transformed the dream from victim to 

549
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,420
hero essentially.
And that was the end of her nightmares.

550
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,463
And that happens more often than you 
than you might think because the dream 

551
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:50,490
is presenting you with the problem,
right?

552
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,800
It's like a threat detection mechanism.
It says,

553
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:53,634
well here's the threat.
Maybe it's expressing it in symbolic 

554
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:59,850
terms or maybe it's using a general 
category like monster.

555
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,790
It's like our monsters chasing you.
Well,

556
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:05,670
it depends on what you mean by monsters.
But functionally,

557
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:07,770
yes they are,
you know,

558
00:27:07,771 --> 00:27:08,730
while you might think,
well,

559
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:11,790
conceptualizing them as monsters isn't 
exactly accurate.

560
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:12,624
It's like,
well,

561
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,540
it's not exactly clear that it's not 
accurate.

562
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:17,913
So

563
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,013
I think a monster is a monster is like a
representation of the class of all 

564
00:27:24,021 --> 00:27:26,090
things that could chase you and devour 
you.

565
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,450
And there's lots of those that are 
symbolic and articulate.

566
00:27:29,451 --> 00:27:32,690
Like if you're arguing with someone who 
can defeat you or you know,

567
00:27:32,691 --> 00:27:34,710
there are,
there are certainly predators on the,

568
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,970
on the Internet that are waiting for you
at pretty much any moment to slip up.

569
00:27:37,971 --> 00:27:38,804
And like the idea that the world is full
of monstrous embodied forces that have 

570
00:27:42,921 --> 00:27:45,590
you as target for pray.
It's like,

571
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,750
yes,
that's right.

572
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,880
Obviously that's right.
So,

573
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,520
so Freud,
Freud's theory of dreams was essentially

574
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:05,270
that there was a little late and content
in the dream,

575
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:06,104
which is what the dream really meant,
and then the layers of weird 

576
00:28:09,411 --> 00:28:10,244
transformation of the idea.
He thought about displacement where one 

577
00:28:13,071 --> 00:28:13,904
thing would stand for another or 
condensation where a lot of the events 

578
00:28:16,191 --> 00:28:19,970
would be rammed together in a very short
sequence or symbolization.

579
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:20,983
So like the mouse in my client's phobia 
would be a good example of 

580
00:28:24,591 --> 00:28:26,210
symbolization,
of fear,

581
00:28:26,211 --> 00:28:31,211
of sexual penetration and dramatization.
He thought of those is all ways that the

582
00:28:31,221 --> 00:28:36,221
dream was hiding the latent content from
the dreamer in order to protect sleep.

583
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:37,903
Whereas you young and Freud really 
argued about this and it's part of what 

584
00:28:40,161 --> 00:28:41,390
broke them apart.
Young said,

585
00:28:41,391 --> 00:28:41,691
no,
no,

586
00:28:41,691 --> 00:28:42,524
no,
that's,

587
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:45,470
that might be right in some cases,
but generally what the dream is doing,

588
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,970
it's just a fact of nature.

589
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,043
The dream is trying to think something 
up and so it might be concentrating on 

590
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:54,290
something that you refuse to admit to 
and repressed,

591
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:58,040
but sometimes it's just like out there 
with free play at fantasy,

592
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,140
trying to generally orient you in the 
world.

593
00:29:00,141 --> 00:29:00,974
So he thought about it and you'll also 
thought it's like young was an 

594
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,990
archeologist of the Ed in some sense,
you know,

595
00:29:05,991 --> 00:29:06,824
he thought of the Ed as a much as a more
creative place in some sense than than 

596
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:11,863
Freud did and as the place where new 
ideas and new adaptive patterns were 

597
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,004
born.
So he believed that the dream was 

598
00:29:18,771 --> 00:29:19,604
generally fairly logical and one of the 
things you did when you recounted the 

599
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:24,194
dream,
no matter how accurately you tried to 

600
00:29:25,341 --> 00:29:26,174
recount it,
was to transform it into more of a 

601
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:31,430
narrative form than it actually took as 
a dream.

602
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,540
And so no doubt that's true because when
you describe an experience,

603
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,550
even if it's an experience you have 
every day,

604
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,760
you basically extract out the gist and 
then describe the.

605
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,123
And you have to do the same thing with 
dreams because you can't present the 

606
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:47,710
images.
So it might that just the act of telling

607
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:49,720
the dream might even be useful in that 
sense.

608
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:50,554
Because what you're doing is making 
whatever that thought is more coherent 

609
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:55,540
than it would otherwise be.
So.

610
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:03,210
So I want to run through this,
this psychosexual theory very rapidly,

611
00:30:03,211 --> 00:30:07,050
and then I want to show you some 
examples of it so you don't believe that

612
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:07,973
in some sense,
you know you had a primary energy and 

613
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:13,080
that psychic energy,
that's what we call energy.

614
00:30:13,081 --> 00:30:13,914
You know,
when you say I'm feeling energetic 

615
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:16,830
today,
it's not obvious what that means,

616
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,693
but Freud regarded that as libidinal and
he thought that there were multiple 

617
00:30:21,601 --> 00:30:22,434
sources of libido,
but the most fundamental source with 

618
00:30:24,301 --> 00:30:25,134
sexuality,
and I think he thought that in part 

619
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:28,590
because of the influence of Darwin's 
ideas,

620
00:30:28,591 --> 00:30:29,424
because Darwin basically said that the 
goal of organisms was essentially to 

621
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:33,743
procreate.
The sexual urge is extraordinarily 

622
00:30:36,241 --> 00:30:37,074
strong and so he thought it was primary 
and you can make a reasonable case that 

623
00:30:42,211 --> 00:30:43,044
it's primary,
but I think it's too reductionistic 

624
00:30:44,461 --> 00:30:45,294
because there's lots of drives that 
people have and it isn't obvious that 

625
00:30:48,241 --> 00:30:51,870
they all coagulate into a single source 
of energy.

626
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,853
Somewhere in the psyche.
If you look at the way the brain is 

627
00:30:55,411 --> 00:30:56,244
structured,
actually the part of the brain that 

628
00:30:57,661 --> 00:30:58,494
wakes you up,
it's called the reticular activating 

629
00:30:59,731 --> 00:31:00,920
system and it's.
It's,

630
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,940
it's some strands way down in the brain 
stem that,

631
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,890
that,
that branch out in a Mo in many,

632
00:31:07,891 --> 00:31:10,530
many ways out into the brain like a tree
in some sense,

633
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:13,740
if you twist your head the wrong way 
when you have a car accident,

634
00:31:13,741 --> 00:31:14,574
sometimes you can shear off those tracks
and then you're in a coma and there's 

635
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,263
nothing that can be done about it,
but the reticular activating system is 

636
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:22,140
really,
really old.

637
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,190
I could seems older than all the 
motivation and emotional systems,

638
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,263
and so if there is a libido,
which would be whatever it is that the 

639
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:35,740
reticular activating system does in 
order to awaken you from your slumber,

640
00:31:35,741 --> 00:31:36,574
say,
or to put you on alert when something 

641
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:40,710
happens,
it looks like it's older than all the.

642
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,030
The isolated,
motivational and emotional systems.

643
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:48,340
So the libido per se,
isn't sexual by,

644
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,530
by all appearances.
It's something that's below sexuality.

645
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,903
No.
So,

646
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:55,643
but you know,
it's still reasonable to note that 

647
00:31:56,611 --> 00:31:59,490
sexuality is a powerful driving force.
So

648
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,890
Freud said it begins its development in 
infancy.

649
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,783
The infant is a sexual being by which he
meant the infant is capable of 

650
00:32:07,311 --> 00:32:09,830
experiencing sexual pleasure.
So why not,

651
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,673
I should let you know that one of the 
practices of Victoria nurses with male 

652
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:18,050
babies was to masturbate them till they 
till satiation so they would sleep.

653
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,210
So it's not,
it's there,

654
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,070
it's not like there's no evidence for 
sexual pleasure in,

655
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:24,200
in,
in children,

656
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,363
in infants in particular,
Freud thought about that as 

657
00:32:27,231 --> 00:32:28,064
polymorphously,
perverse by which he meant that the 

658
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,210
infant was willing to take pleasure in 
any,

659
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,373
in any activity whatsoever,
and babies can have some pretty messy 

660
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:36,914
habits without any structuring of that 
and then that that channeled in various 

661
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:41,720
ways as the,
as the,

662
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,210
as the baby developed.
So here,

663
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,820
here are his stages,
the aural period.

664
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:47,983
Well,
it's quite interesting that when a baby 

665
00:32:48,981 --> 00:32:49,814
is born,
the part of its body that is in fact 

666
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:52,904
most mature,
most like a mature part in terms of its 

667
00:32:55,461 --> 00:32:59,090
eventual function is in fact the mouth 
and the tongue and obvious.

668
00:32:59,090 --> 00:32:59,923
There's obvious reasons for that because
the baby has to be able to latch onto 

669
00:33:02,421 --> 00:33:04,430
the nipple,
you know right away.

670
00:33:04,431 --> 00:33:06,650
And that's actually quite a complicated 
activity.

671
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,484
It's a complicated social activity and 
it requires a fair bit of coordination 

672
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:13,550
between the baby and the mother.
It's not something automatic.

673
00:33:13,551 --> 00:33:15,400
So if the baby didn't come out,
um,

674
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,443
you know,
wired up for certain basic in certain 

675
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:22,340
basic ways it wouldn't be able to get 
going to begin with.

676
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:24,620
So it's definitely wired up in an oral 
manner.

677
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,760
So he thought if the oral character as 
passive optimistic independent,

678
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:33,740
and there's the anal period where the 
Freud thought that's where the ego,

679
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,793
the Super Ego for the first time in some
sense where the child has had to 

680
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:37,994
renounce primary pleasure and so that 
would be the pleasure of dedication 

681
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:42,134
fundamentally in favor of a more complex
form of behavior and that that was 

682
00:33:45,951 --> 00:33:46,784
actually an inhibitory process and 
certainly the case that parents can get 

683
00:33:50,121 --> 00:33:53,750
into like year long wars with,
with kids over toilet training,

684
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:54,530
you know.

685
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,200
So I've seen some pretty weird examples 
of that.

686
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,540
So I,
I saw one parent who,

687
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,780
who was in such a war with,
with their three year old,

688
00:34:02,781 --> 00:34:03,614
that that three year old would only 
dedicate if the mother put a diaper on 

689
00:34:07,081 --> 00:34:08,720
them.
So it had perfect control,

690
00:34:08,721 --> 00:34:10,730
but it was like there was a war going 
on,

691
00:34:10,731 --> 00:34:11,564
so,
and he thought of anal people as 

692
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,380
orderly,
parsimonious,

693
00:34:15,381 --> 00:34:17,210
and obstinate.
It's kind of interesting too,

694
00:34:17,211 --> 00:34:18,044
because one of the things that we found 
recently is that conscientiousness is 

695
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:22,490
one of the big five traits,
right?

696
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,760
You can break it into orderliness and 
into industriousness and orderliness,

697
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,293
predicts conservatism and predicts 
authoritarianism and it's associated 

698
00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:35,720
with disgust sensitivity.
So I thought,

699
00:34:35,721 --> 00:34:37,010
Huh,
that's pretty interesting.

700
00:34:37,011 --> 00:34:37,844
You know,
and it's also the other thing that's 

701
00:34:38,901 --> 00:34:39,734
really cool about orderliness and 
disgust sensitivity is that it is 

702
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:48,770
associated with disgust associated with 
anything that would contaminate.

703
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:53,360
And so the idea that that's associated 
in some sense with,

704
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,880
with,
with anal thinking is

705
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,470
it's,
there's something about it that's right.

706
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,573
You know,
and it's also pretty important to note 

707
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:05,450
that the reason that all you people are 
going to live to be 90 or thereabouts,

708
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:09,290
roughly speaking,
isn't doctors and it's plumbers.

709
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,720
So.
Right.

710
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,460
Really?
So,

711
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:14,540
you know,
uh,

712
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,690
the,
the,

713
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:16,643
the life is in itself contaminating and 
we have a built in system that's the 

714
00:35:21,231 --> 00:35:23,330
disgust system to take care of that 
problem.

715
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,313
And it's clear that that does vary in 
strength between individuals and it's 

716
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:32,300
also clear that the degree to which that
if you have a stronger disgust system,

717
00:35:32,301 --> 00:35:35,510
you're much more likely to be 
conservative in your political beliefs.

718
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,160
So that's pretty cool.
It's like it's not something obvious.

719
00:35:38,161 --> 00:35:39,960
You know,
the Phallic period,

720
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,830
three to five,
that's when Freud believed that children

721
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:44,664
often discovered masturbation and that's
when girls develop penis envy and boys 

722
00:35:49,011 --> 00:35:52,290
develop castration anxiety,
which I said is a small price to pay for

723
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:54,510
the possession of a penis.
Yeah.

724
00:35:54,511 --> 00:35:55,344
So all right,
here's a way of thinking about the 

725
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:59,043
depaul phase.
It's basically hostility and erotic 

726
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:04,194
attraction towards the parents now for 
and thought about this as a normative 

727
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:09,570
part of development.

728
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,150
And
that's a tough one.

729
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:15,563
It certainly does seem to be the case 
and there is some experimental evidence 

730
00:36:17,911 --> 00:36:19,410
that boys

731
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,080
fight more with their fathers and girls 
fight more with their mothers.

732
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:26,783
So that's kind of interesting.
But I think I not so sure that the idea 

733
00:36:30,061 --> 00:36:32,790
that this is normative development is 
exactly right.

734
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:33,624
And maybe maybe Freud got skewed over a 
bit because he was always dealing with 

735
00:36:36,331 --> 00:36:38,430
people who had one form of pathology or 
another.

736
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:39,803
Now here's,
here's how to develop an equitable 

737
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:43,950
situation if you want to with your 
children.

738
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:44,784
Some of you will take this road so maybe
this will help you do it better if 

739
00:36:47,551 --> 00:36:48,384
that's really what you're into.
So the thing to do is make sure that 

740
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:52,044
your marriage is quite hostile so that 
you have a lot of underlying resentment 

741
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:59,820
to your partner and that will,
that will encourage you to suddenly turn

742
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:00,863
one of your children or more of them 
against that parent without them really 

743
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:04,854
knowing it.
And you can do that by covertly 

744
00:37:06,211 --> 00:37:09,120
reinforcing them when they do that or 
ignoring them,

745
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,310
that's even better when they do the 
opposite.

746
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:14,370
So you know maybe your daughter is being
nice to your husband,

747
00:37:14,371 --> 00:37:15,204
you're already mad at him so that you 
know you make it known to her using one 

748
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:22,050
strategy or another that you don't 
really approve of that sort of behavior.

749
00:37:22,051 --> 00:37:23,640
So that's pretty effective way of doing 
it.

750
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,090
Then the next thing to do is this works 
really well.

751
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:28,620
If you have a young boy and you're a 
woman.

752
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,030
It's like you know,
you wanna,

753
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,060
you wanna develop a lot of hostility 
towards your husband so you really don't

754
00:37:33,061 --> 00:37:33,894
want to have anything to do with them 
and you don't really want him to even 

755
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:39,150
touch you and because of that you're not
even really all that happy about men.

756
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,433
And so then you do two things is that 
you turn to your son because he's kind 

757
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,393
of harmless and you make your 
relationship way closer than it should 

758
00:37:47,821 --> 00:37:51,480
be with him and you encourage all sorts 
of things that are really kind of on the

759
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:56,481
edge of acceptable behavior and at the 
same time you repress and crush any part

760
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:57,624
of him that would develop in the kind of
masculinity that would enable him to 

761
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:03,360
turn into the monster that you think 
your husband is.

762
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,050
So that's a really effective.
And people can do that for like 20 years

763
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,430
and outcome.
Is that.

764
00:38:08,431 --> 00:38:10,650
I have a lot of business as a therapist 
because

765
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,430
I do see this sort of thing and a lot 
of.

766
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,480
A lot of what happens in therapy is that
it's an interesting thing is people come

767
00:38:18,481 --> 00:38:20,370
to see me to solve all sorts of 
problems,

768
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,233
like have a very large number of sorts,
but one of the common problems is they 

769
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:29,400
cannot get away from their families.
They can't,

770
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:33,240
they can't break.
Those initial isn't even break them.

771
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:36,100
The family can't negotiate a to allow

772
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,940
the person to manifest the independence 
that would be necessary for them to have

773
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:42,640
their own life and their own family and 
their own career.

774
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:46,450
And so they're struggling and they're 
caught in these often ugly nets,

775
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:49,960
like often unbelievably ugly nets and 
they can't get out of them.

776
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,700
And that's what we're going to see right
now.

777
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:57,900
So
now this character Robert Crumb,

778
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,360
he's quite the character and we should 
turn those lights down.

779
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,323
Yeah,
that's good.

780
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,713
Maybe
we can do a voiceover and this later so 

781
00:39:12,231 --> 00:39:15,980
it doesn't really matter if we have.
Let's do that.

782
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,173
Okay.
So Robert Crumb was an underground 

783
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:23,914
cartoonist is an underground cartoonist 
and he lived in Berkeley in the late 

784
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:26,974
sixties and this documentary was made 
about him and his family and so I'm 

785
00:39:30,011 --> 00:39:30,844
going to get you to watch as much of it 
as we can watch and maybe I'll show you 

786
00:39:33,611 --> 00:39:37,030
a bit more in the next class so I'm not 
supposed to because we're supposed to do

787
00:39:37,031 --> 00:39:38,350
something else,
but I might anyways.

788
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,633
Now this film,
I love this film for a variety of 

789
00:39:42,431 --> 00:39:43,121
reasons.
First of all,

790
00:39:43,121 --> 00:39:45,130
I think it's a work of genius.
Second,

791
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,293
I've never ever seen any film of any 
sort that does as good a job of 

792
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,673
illustrating not only what Freudian 
psychopathology is and how it manifests 

793
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:58,600
itself symbolically,
but also how the family plays into it.

794
00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:00,460
So away we go

795
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:02,030
me
off.

796
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,750
Okay.
So here's what happened.

797
00:42:36,751 --> 00:42:37,584
The film crew wants to go to his house 
where his brothers still lives and film 

798
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:42,684
his brother Charles,
who's lived there since he was 55 and 

799
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:46,560
he's lived there since he was a 
teenager.

800
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:49,830
And you notice how Robert uses a very 
soft voice.

801
00:42:49,831 --> 00:42:52,380
He's talking to his mother and you know,
he's got a whole.

802
00:42:52,381 --> 00:42:53,214
He's a famous guy.
He's got a whole film crew there and 

803
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,733
he's basically asking his mother if it's
okay if he brings his friends over and 

804
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:00,300
she basically says,
well,

805
00:43:00,301 --> 00:43:01,920
I don't think that would be such a good 
idea,

806
00:43:01,921 --> 00:43:02,754
and he backs off right away.
And then when he gets off the phone he 

807
00:43:04,891 --> 00:43:05,341
says,
well,

808
00:43:05,341 --> 00:43:06,031
she said,
no,

809
00:43:06,031 --> 00:43:06,900
you know,
that's it.

810
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,760
So you know,
that's.

811
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,573
That's if you're.
If you have a good snake detector 

812
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,870
working and you're listening and 
watching closely,

813
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,003
you know that there are a tremendous 
number of snakes under the surface 

814
00:43:20,261 --> 00:43:21,094
already.

815
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:42,230
The soul of people
expressing their connection to eternity,

816
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:50,680
whatever you want to call it,
modern doesn't have lost that.

817
00:43:50,681 --> 00:43:52,760
People can express themselves that way 
anymore.

818
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:54,703
So that's a very paradoxical set of 
statements because on the one hand he's 

819
00:43:57,441 --> 00:44:00,290
expressing,
he says he really loves old music and he

820
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:03,410
loves it because he can hear the soul of
the common man being expressed.

821
00:44:03,411 --> 00:44:08,210
But then he takes like a pot shot at the
entire world of music since 1920,

822
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:11,900
which indicates a tremendous amount of,
of implicit arrogance.

823
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,770
And he also says that's the only time 
that he feels any love for humanity.

824
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:16,761
It's like,
well,

825
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:17,594
first of all,
I'm not sure that his attitude towards 

826
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:22,850
humanity as a whole is actually all that
relevant.

827
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:24,020
And second,
if,

828
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:24,943
if you're,
if you've put yourself in the position 

829
00:44:26,571 --> 00:44:30,050
where you regard yourself as a credible 
judge of humanity,

830
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,070
it's like you might want to take a few 
steps

831
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,690
back from your narcissism,
right?

832
00:44:33,691 --> 00:44:35,460
Right then and there.
So,

833
00:44:35,461 --> 00:44:37,320
and I'm not kidding about this,
I'll tell you,

834
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:39,540
those kids who showed up at Columbine 
high school,

835
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:41,573
they had their motivations and they 
wrote them down and they knew exactly 

836
00:44:43,651 --> 00:44:46,680
what they were doing.
And the leader who was the more literary

837
00:44:46,681 --> 00:44:50,160
of the two said quite explicitly that he
was the judge of the human race.

838
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:53,850
And as far as he was concerned,
it didn't pass his judgment and that you

839
00:44:53,851 --> 00:44:56,910
know,
that he was perfectly reasonable for him

840
00:44:56,911 --> 00:44:59,190
to go on a cleansing binge.
You know?

841
00:44:59,191 --> 00:45:00,024
And,
and he didn't just want to shoot up a 

842
00:45:01,051 --> 00:45:01,650
whole,
you know,

843
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:02,483
a few students in the school,
he had bombs planted all over the 

844
00:45:04,771 --> 00:45:05,604
school.
He wanted a whole apocalyptic scene and 

845
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:09,180
they had dreamed about blowing up 
Detroit.

846
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:10,014
And so you could imagine what would 
happen if someone like him got their 

847
00:45:12,301 --> 00:45:14,670
finger on the button of the,
of the,

848
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:18,120
of a hydrogen bomb.
So,

849
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:20,580
you know,
young said,

850
00:45:20,581 --> 00:45:23,010
if you go deep enough into the shadow,
you find hell.

851
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:24,750
It's like,
that's exactly right.

852
00:45:24,751 --> 00:45:25,800
And it's no joke.

853
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:06,790
This is mom's house.

854
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,750
Do you read any good books lately?
Just

855
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:19,600
kind of like recycling a lot of these 
books,

856
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,313
recycling.

857
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:24,420
They've got a very interesting voice 
tone,

858
00:48:24,421 --> 00:48:26,100
which,
which you might pick up on as well.

859
00:48:26,101 --> 00:48:29,370
It's very ironic,
like everything they say is ironic.

860
00:48:29,371 --> 00:48:30,204
Scott,
this kind of bitter and arrogant twist 

861
00:48:31,411 --> 00:48:32,244
in it and they're talking about 
absolutely catastrophic things like 

862
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:39,900
nightmarishly catastrophic things.
Yet there's this sort of adolescent like

863
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,060
banter and,
and laughter about it

864
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,100
when you were reading all year,
20 years ago,

865
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,200
do that
because there's nothing else

866
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:59,730
you ever read anything new.
Really recent writers

867
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,990
I'm interested in,
most of them

868
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:17,190
are not nearly as interesting as the old
lady,

869
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:21,213
so you know,
Freud would say here that there's an 

870
00:49:22,991 --> 00:49:26,140
awful lot of intellectual ization going 
on and there definitely is.

871
00:49:26,141 --> 00:49:26,974
So these,
these guys are very divorced from their 

872
00:49:28,451 --> 00:49:30,220
bodies and they have every reason to be

873
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:42,183
books.
Charles is the one that started this 

874
00:49:50,311 --> 00:49:54,300
whole comic thing.
He was completely obsessed with comics.

875
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:57,600
We are kids had absolutely no other 
normal kid.

876
00:49:57,601 --> 00:49:58,434
Interesting.
Wasn't interested in toys or games in 

877
00:50:00,721 --> 00:50:01,560
place.
Scores,

878
00:50:01,561 --> 00:50:05,360
didn't do anything but read comics for 
all comics thing.

879
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:06,263
Come and talk and the drawing,
the other drawing interest besides the 

880
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:12,263
control realistic scenes and you know,
just pictures of buildings and cars and 

881
00:50:17,301 --> 00:50:19,110
stuff was interested in that at all.
It's only

882
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:25,640
the earliest one that is still existed.
I had as Charles through this one that's

883
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,353
supposed to be.
And

884
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,570
Yeah,
so you hear that laugh.

885
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:31,993
It's like
that's the situation they're in is 

886
00:50:35,461 --> 00:50:36,294
adults and Charles could see that coming
and he had all sorts of homicidal 

887
00:50:40,201 --> 00:50:41,034
fantasies about.

888
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,593
How about Robert?
It was unconsciously imitating when I 

889
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:08,583
forced you draw comic books.
There's still a kind of sibling rivalry 

890
00:51:13,901 --> 00:51:18,901
going on between the me and the kids and
he was still living in

891
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,100
basically the wrong.
You're still competing with each other.

892
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,090
Drug products.
I still think of Charles approval

893
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:32,230
like Charles drawing come.

894
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:33,603
Yeah,
so what basically happened was Robert 

895
00:51:34,901 --> 00:51:36,820
got the world and Charles God,
his mother,

896
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:41,500
so they both won,
but I have Charles I don't think is very

897
00:51:41,501 --> 00:51:42,580
happy with what he want

898
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,750
tunes
where we sat around and talked about.

899
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:56,940
I was usually the president,
vice president,

900
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:02,450
secretary and saying that he was the 
trailer

901
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:13,110
to still.
He still resents the fact that we impose

902
00:52:13,111 --> 00:52:14,800
on the role of supply.
Boy Them.

903
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:52,390
Excellent was the scapegoat and
five kids.

904
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:54,143
He was definitely the bottom of the 
ocean to explain is that we have these 

905
00:52:58,261 --> 00:53:03,261
meetings for this,
this Columbus Club,

906
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:08,940
comics and Austin and bring out their 
10th or different jobs or different like

907
00:53:08,941 --> 00:53:11,800
a secretary and prison or vice president
on our

908
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,610
director Robert did or something that 
seals.

909
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:22,350
The whole thing is just like incredible,
crazy,

910
00:53:22,351 --> 00:53:23,184
similar thing in me and Charles and 
Robert have been slight little room 

911
00:53:25,501 --> 00:53:28,530
upstairs in the whole rest of the world 
to know what the fuck is going on,

912
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:32,550
so he's
working at it on the trees,

913
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,130
you know,
it was just together

914
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:37,943
in a closed situation
fired by the Disney movie where Robert 

915
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:51,330
Newton plays alone.

916
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:56,330
John Silver in episode in 1955 when we 
started like playing pirates here,

917
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:01,320
like normal kids go out,
pretend you've made this shift,

918
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,154
that little refrigerator cart and then 
everything that Charles would walk 

919
00:54:06,421 --> 00:54:08,850
around town dressed up like long John 
Silver,

920
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:13,260
crystal coded my mother's as Long Green 
Code and he made himself a three pointer

921
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:14,103
and has that.
He had a crutch and you tied with leg 

922
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:17,663
like go around town that way.
I hadn't realized that years later 

923
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,533
fixated Charles really wasn't as 
treasurer and then this thing done on 

924
00:54:24,351 --> 00:54:28,620
the native art played aren't as bad as 
the first six or seven years after that.

925
00:54:28,621 --> 00:54:29,454
We do these context about treasure.
I became Israel Baroque elaborate thing 

926
00:54:33,961 --> 00:54:38,850
way beyond the original Disney film.
This was one of,

927
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:41,910
Charles is one of our two med,
yes,

928
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,250
in which he would draw some of the 
characters,

929
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:47,220
knives are also interact with each 
other.

930
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:48,173
That was also a great school of 
cartooning for me is having to come up 

931
00:54:52,651 --> 00:54:55,590
with clever retorts to him.
He was.

932
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,380
He's actually much cleaner and funnier 
than I was.

933
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:00,940
It actually got kind of tiresome.
Buddy,

934
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:03,090
you know he had to do it,
but he was in charge.

935
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:06,560
Has very like definitely band from about
Charles was not.

936
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,433
Sometimes I think a lot of them do with 
like overly morbid sensitivity to the 

937
00:55:10,711 --> 00:55:13,620
guy or something too as well.
Assistant you have a natural affinity to

938
00:55:13,621 --> 00:55:17,090
get into your profit.
Off of robbery course was someone in the

939
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:21,430
middle man had this wind like 
restricting and complex,

940
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:24,660
like terrible selfconsciousness 
restriction and me as a kid,

941
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,553
I was like morbidly monster.
My body like sex plate completely came 

942
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:30,413
time for me to become sexually like a 
puberty or something like sex with 

943
00:55:34,990 --> 00:55:36,530
nowhere near my life.
You know what?

944
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,990
Just put them to sleep.
It was like six so heavily repressed,

945
00:55:39,991 --> 00:55:43,410
which meant naturally editing.
Sneezers started to have a seizure,

946
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:46,270
so this was like a point where your 
behavior becomes,

947
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,253
wow,
I have to get into the whole sector 

948
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:51,000
versus normal up topic,
you know?

949
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,073
That's all I thought about when I was in
my late teens and early twenties in a 

950
00:55:54,481 --> 00:55:58,980
sentence and I masturbated about four or
five times a week.

951
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,510
How frequently did you ask anyone out?
My sexual desires.

952
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:06,800
You did.
Like I told him the other night.

953
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,960
I can't even get any reception know 
whether it's the one thing or maybe it's

954
00:56:14,821 --> 00:56:15,654
a combination of things.
Maybe it's a combination of the 

955
00:56:17,701 --> 00:56:20,430
medication and the lack of external 
stimulation.

956
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:25,650
Maybe approaching old age to have 
something meaning any,

957
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:29,590
some external stimulation to keep up 
your interest?

958
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:33,200
I don't know.
Now that my sexual desires in that

959
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:41,350
earliest sexual abuse.
Have you ever actually,

960
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:45,560
it will be like 40 years old and getting
directions.

961
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:50,970
Here's my aunt or my older sister and 
her legs and her shoes.

962
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,313
Like I need a table instead of going 
like mother's closet and she had these 

963
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:00,270
cowboy boots that she wore when it 
rained and humping goes in the closet.

964
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,160
I
already

965
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:11,780
have
five or six.

966
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:18,590
I was sexually attracted to bugs bunny 
bunny,

967
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:19,853
have to cover the chronic bucket to 
carry the rail with my pocket to get 

968
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:29,810
looked at,
periodically wrinkled up and handling it

969
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:30,773
so much that they asked me whether the 
fire engine on the ironing board and 

970
00:57:33,751 --> 00:57:34,584
flatten it out,
and she did not as deeply as appointed 

971
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:38,520
because it got old brown.
When she died.

972
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:39,403
It crumbled apart.
This sexual attraction to keep cartoon 

973
00:57:46,621 --> 00:57:51,120
characters.
You tell me

974
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,460
I don't change.
When I turned 12,

975
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,280
55,
56,

976
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:15,410
totally obsessed with she lives.
Went to bid.

977
00:58:15,411 --> 00:58:17,900
Are they of best things I wanted to do 
with sheep.

978
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:27,580
Now you see how how he conceptualizes 
himself in relationship to her too,

979
00:58:27,581 --> 00:58:28,414
so he's like this while he's a lot 
smaller than she is and he's clearly 

980
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,273
depended on her physical strength and 
ability and so he definitely 

981
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:41,320
conceptualized as himself as a 
subordinate entities

982
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:48,070
very hung up on
even more so.

983
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:57,370
I think you were more shy
actually.

984
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:02,350
I think you were more afraid of women 
was as a young person

985
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:04,793
in high school.
I had a few dates with girls when you 

986
00:59:06,331 --> 00:59:07,164
were in high school,
you at all with anybody sort of good 

987
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,350
looking at everything.
Almost a handsome,

988
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:17,870
good looking chaplains and teenager.
There was just this.

989
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:23,100
Something was wrong with my personality.
High school was an absolute nightmare.

990
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,990
It was the most unpopular kid in high 
school.

991
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:36,190
People were always taken on the the male
and the girls didn't have anything to do

992
00:59:36,411 --> 00:59:40,120
with me.
They treated me like I was just there

993
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:42,553
trip by my by predominantly women 
starting with high school where I 

994
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,093
learned a lot about women because there 
was this guy case Gutsche escape here 

995
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:55,930
with like the
mean bully,

996
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:59,770
but he's also very charming and all the 
girls liked him.

997
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:02,143
The dream boat that was also bullied in 
my brother Charles was one of the guys 

998
01:00:07,811 --> 01:00:08,644
singled out for particular attention.
If you get this gang of flowing piece 

999
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:18,220
that had around with disguise Ganache,
so scene where they were special punches

1000
01:00:19,451 --> 01:00:24,451
up my brother in the hallway at school 
sense I to see Charles gave up trying to

1001
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:29,100
be popular or had girlfriends or 
anything.

1002
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,130
If everybody saw that he could fight 
back,

1003
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,760
beat up by Scotch,

1004
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:34,913
so that was probably enough to get his 
depression going because it's a major 

1005
01:00:37,561 --> 01:00:38,520
dominance,
hierarchy,

1006
01:00:38,521 --> 01:00:40,170
defeat,
and he was also an outcast,

1007
01:00:40,171 --> 01:00:42,030
so he's not even in the dominance 
hierarchy.

1008
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:43,133
He was one of the class of boys by his 
own account that was so contemptible 

1009
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:47,423
that he wasn't even in the realm of 
possible date partners for any of the 

1010
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:52,914
girls.
And so when you're thinking about why 

1011
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:57,720
Robert is dry drawing women with like 
vicious bird heads,

1012
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:58,733
one of the things that you might think 
about is that for men at the bottom of 

1013
01:01:01,111 --> 01:01:01,944
the dominance hierarchy or outside the 
dominance hierarchy completely like 

1014
01:01:04,471 --> 01:01:07,140
these guys were all they ever got from 
girls,

1015
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,100
including their own mother was rejection
like harsh rejection.

1016
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:12,143
And it was enough basically.
Well it was really in the final 

1017
01:01:14,101 --> 01:01:15,810
analysis.
It was enough to kill Charles.

1018
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:16,793
Now I'm not blaming the girls,
but I'm trying to explain why Robert is 

1019
01:01:21,241 --> 01:01:23,760
expressing himself the way that he's 
expressing himself.

1020
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,170
Why these images come up?

1021
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:34,870
You
gotta take

1022
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:41,200
tranquilizers.
That makes it a lot easier.

1023
01:01:43,330 --> 01:01:44,163
You know,
and so Charles still has this kind of 

1024
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,910
dream in the back of his head too,
which is really the image,

1025
01:01:47,911 --> 01:01:52,320
the idea that the Charles is living out,
which is that Charles has it much easier

1026
01:01:52,321 --> 01:01:53,154
and much better than he does because he 
doesn't really have to deal with the 

1027
01:01:55,321 --> 01:01:57,840
world and he can just stay at home and 
comfort with his mother.

1028
01:01:57,841 --> 01:01:58,674
It's like he's not in comfort.
The guy he commits suicide six months 

1029
01:02:01,591 --> 01:02:03,090
after this film

1030
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:12,953
now

1031
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:14,583
that's extremely interesting.
So young had this idea about 

1032
01:02:17,051 --> 01:02:18,090
synchronicity,
you know,

1033
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:18,963
he said now and then would happen in the
world that we're connected weirdly 

1034
01:02:21,841 --> 01:02:22,674
because of a,
like an emotional contagion and it's a 

1035
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:26,754
very strange idea,
but I wanted to show you an example of 

1036
01:02:28,531 --> 01:02:29,970
it because it's actually caught on film 
here.

1037
01:02:29,971 --> 01:02:32,790
So when Charles and Robert are talking 
about their mother,

1038
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,470
you notice Charles Hunches right over 
it,

1039
01:02:34,471 --> 01:02:35,304
right?
He's like even more inside than he 

1040
01:02:36,811 --> 01:02:37,644
normally is and they turn into 2:13 year
old teenage boys talking upstairs so 

1041
01:02:41,521 --> 01:02:44,490
their mother won't hear them as soon as 
they mentioned her.

1042
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:46,200
She pipes in.

1043
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:09,323
Okay.

1044
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:22,780
Now you see when,
when he did hear her,

1045
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:23,733
she's complaining about the curtains 
being closed with something in this 

1046
01:03:26,141 --> 01:03:28,590
camera crew cluttering up your house,
which you know,

1047
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:29,463
probably hasn't been cleaned since 1957.
It's not really that she matters that 

1048
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:35,050
she cares,
that they're there.

1049
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:37,780
What she's doing is expressing her 
dominance and it's.

1050
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:39,470
And she does it in a very,
uh,

1051
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:42,940
very subterranean way and Charles is 
absolutely terrified of her.

1052
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:05,710
No,
don't worry about it.

1053
01:04:05,711 --> 01:04:07,960
It's all going to be out here and I'll 
be back to normal.

1054
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:17,570
Cool.
These girls talking about one difference

1055
01:04:17,571 --> 01:04:19,750
could a date.
It's good.

1056
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,130
She's envious.
They all are.

1057
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:25,270
This is how I still
bitter about

1058
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:27,773
it.
Most teenage boys are very cool and 

1059
01:04:30,831 --> 01:04:31,664
aggressive and everything like that.
If girls would see that I was more kind 

1060
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,293
of insensitive things press,
but I expect that I could draw but 

1061
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,870
couldn't understand why they liked these
cool,

1062
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:42,733
aggressive guys.
Not me because I was more kind and 

1063
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:48,040
sensitive and everything for them.
I was more like him,

1064
01:04:48,041 --> 01:04:50,180
but he realized he didn't want him to be
like them.

1065
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:54,890
Basically filtered,
hurt and cruelly misunderstood because I

1066
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,900
consider myself talented,
intelligent.

1067
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:01,640
It's not very attractive physically.
I think those things really mattered.

1068
01:05:01,641 --> 01:05:02,474
It was what's inside.
When I was 13 and 14 and trying to be 

1069
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,080
normal teenager,
it was like a really ensured.

1070
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:10,870
We just,
I tried to go.

1071
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,720
Applicant thought they were acting.
It's raw and weird,

1072
01:05:14,721 --> 01:05:15,554
so then I just stopped completely and 
just became a shadow and I wasn't even 

1073
01:05:19,691 --> 01:05:21,640
there.
People weren't even aware that it was,

1074
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:23,270
you know,
in,

1075
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:28,360
in the same world they are in.
That kind of freed me completely because

1076
01:05:28,361 --> 01:05:30,250
it wasn't under those pressures to be 
normal.

1077
01:05:30,251 --> 01:05:34,000
So I got interested in old time music 
and went to the black section of town,

1078
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:34,834
knocking on doors,
looking for old records and things like 

1079
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:39,400
that.
It would be unthinkable if you are going

1080
01:05:39,401 --> 01:05:41,080
to be a normal teenager.

1081
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,003
So Robert can,
despite the fact that he grew up in a 

1082
01:05:44,411 --> 01:05:46,300
family that was very difficult to escape
from,

1083
01:05:46,301 --> 01:05:48,270
did follow his creative interests,
you know,

1084
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,500
and he,
he picked a path that was characteristic

1085
01:05:50,501 --> 01:05:53,530
of individuality and it did get 'em out.
You know,

1086
01:05:53,531 --> 01:05:57,660
he gave up on conformity.
But he found an alternative so you know,

1087
01:05:57,670 --> 01:05:59,470
it's pretty impressive and he did become
very,

1088
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:01,330
very successful.
I want to show you,

1089
01:06:01,331 --> 01:06:03,640
I can't show you all of what I wanted to
show you today,

1090
01:06:03,641 --> 01:06:04,474
but I do

1091
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:16,220
forced me to answer that door and take 
her outside you to put this girl's

1092
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:22,550
armored personality line.
Chileans,

1093
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,880
Rogan,
and then you got a good grade on a test.

1094
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:28,860
Then you've got the
fascinating.

1095
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:37,510
There is six weeks
here.

1096
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:43,820
His other guy got to light jobs,
hit you real art,

1097
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:45,983
Nice.
Five years old at Christmas and this 

1098
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:52,500
whole thing happened during stack,
pleasantly collarbone.

1099
01:06:55,430 --> 01:06:58,290
Charles a pinching for getting in 
trouble,

1100
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:00,413
very diabolical as a Cuban.
And I finally would like beat him 

1101
01:07:03,481 --> 01:07:07,110
unmercifully for these things that he 
was always these crimes.

1102
01:07:07,111 --> 01:07:09,840
He was always convincing and it just,
it just made him worse.

1103
01:07:09,841 --> 01:07:14,841
I think the subconscious desire.
No,

1104
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:34,610
just this.
Oh yeah.

1105
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:35,593
Here we go.

1106
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,790
Yeah.
I think we've got 10 minutes here.

1107
01:07:43,791 --> 01:07:44,624
So

1108
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:54,683
they started being driven by that 
session that I'll go down in history as 

1109
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:03,030
a great artist.
That will be my revenge because my image

1110
01:08:03,031 --> 01:08:03,864
celebrating Valentine's Day 13th,
1962 when I decided to reject 

1111
01:08:09,121 --> 01:08:11,310
conforming,
when society rejected me,

1112
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:15,120
I heard all that be yourselves to 
myself.

1113
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:20,380
Think I'm does not have to be satisfied 
with cans and old records.

1114
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:25,730
Girls are just utterly out reach.
They won't even let me draw them

1115
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:33,090
all that change after you get a famous I
was used to

1116
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:38,060
doing,
which was really quite sweet.

1117
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:43,480
And then he did this one that was just 
incredibly hostile to women,

1118
01:08:44,391 --> 01:08:46,460
very sexual hostile.
And I was,

1119
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:51,850
I wasn't expecting it and it was really.
I was really shocked and taken aback and

1120
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:53,933
really just kind of like,
it's hard for me to believe that he can 

1121
01:08:57,470 --> 01:09:00,740
just channel in sales doing or work.

1122
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:06,850
I like a lot of his work and certainly 
this is the lyrical aspect of it.

1123
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:09,590
But then I find me something completely 
different reaction,

1124
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,430
you know,
perhaps when I've been really turned off

1125
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:15,100
and disgusted.
And um,

1126
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:16,800
you know,
this,

1127
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:21,890
this cartoon show blow is when I thought
about a lot of light.

1128
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:26,170
On the one hand it's a satire of the 19 
fifties.

1129
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:27,063
The healthy facade of the American 
family and it kind of exposes the 

1130
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:30,933
sickness under the surface,
but at the same time you sense the 

1131
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:41,870
crumbs getting off on it himself and 
some other way and on another level it's

1132
01:09:42,001 --> 01:09:46,390
an orange sheets,
self indulgent orgy in a fantasy.

1133
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:47,470
And the fantasy,
you know,

1134
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:48,313
specifically this story is a story about
a father who commands his daughter to 

1135
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,333
give a blow job and she does.
Then they wind up having sex and the 

1136
01:09:57,701 --> 01:09:58,534
little sort of leave it to beaver type 
brother character comes running in and 

1137
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:04,060
he's the father and his sister and he's 
shocked and upset.

1138
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:04,893
He goes running to the mother and tell 
her and mom comes out of the closet 

1139
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:12,040
wearing sort of snm kind of get up and 
go,

1140
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:13,480
oh cool.
You know,

1141
01:10:13,481 --> 01:10:17,920
and the next thing my mom is sending the
whole panel ends.

1142
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:20,380
The whole cartoon is the parents saying,
gee,

1143
01:10:20,381 --> 01:10:22,270
we should spend more time with the kids.
You know,

1144
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:26,590
so
you don't,

1145
01:10:26,591 --> 01:10:27,424
you read something like this.
And I think that it has gone over the 

1146
01:10:31,361 --> 01:10:36,361
line from satire of a 19 fifties,
hygienic,

1147
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:38,403
you know,
family and denial into something which 

1148
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,353
is just chrome producing pornography.
And I think this theme in his word is 

1149
01:10:47,741 --> 01:10:49,180
omnipresent.
It's murder.

1150
01:10:49,181 --> 01:10:51,420
Been arrested,
juvenile position.

1151
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,950
So the mother has these cute things 
scattered everywhere.

1152
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:23,430
We pulled it loose from each other for 
the most part.

1153
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:28,560
You spend all your time down here 
watching television going across or

1154
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:31,660
I spend most of my tops

1155
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:36,170
so you can see how well they communicate

1156
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:44,910
resources living in this.
Well you do,

1157
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:47,410
you do most of the talking and the 
relationship,

1158
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:52,140
he said told me that you take those 
medications.

1159
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,780
Would you still feel nervous and 
depressed sometimes?

1160
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:55,850
You know,
not as.

1161
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,780
Not as much as I would have been.
It wasn't taking.

1162
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:03,380
What do you think would have just 
stopped taking this stuff?

1163
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:08,570
And I tried it a couple of times.
I didn't like what was starting to see

1164
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:15,180
if I were becoming gradually on hinge 
back on them again.

1165
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:18,423
I tried a couple of times.
Do you still think they're picking my 

1166
01:12:22,901 --> 01:12:23,734
brain?

1167
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:29,943
No.
She doesn't have to clean up for the 

1168
01:12:30,711 --> 01:12:32,150
cameras,
that's for sure.

1169
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:40,820
Charles,
some people,

1170
01:12:41,161 --> 01:12:42,060
I mean some,

1171
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:48,030
so you realize that this is a man who 
spent like 30 years in his room upstairs

1172
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:50,093
that has no friends and has never had 
any friends and now it's his mother's 

1173
01:12:53,681 --> 01:12:54,514
response,

1174
01:12:56,240 --> 01:13:00,620
five
from one extreme to the

1175
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:08,440
streets and one of the last time you 
slept old lady in the street and started

1176
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:11,773
drilling or a better spiritual your life
and she just like got really frightened 

1177
01:13:15,771 --> 01:13:17,560
and threaten to call the police and 
everything.

1178
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:22,720
Go to these strangers on the streets or
30,

1179
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:30,290
but
that kind of stuff,

1180
01:13:30,291 --> 01:13:31,124
but
always got in trouble and everyone else 

1181
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:41,410
can be one good reason for leaving
illegal drug is

1182
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:53,370
miserable
is true.

1183
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:01,460
I saw all this
$200 ticket upstairs.

1184
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:13,260
Ever.
See anybody

1185
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:26,260
take a basketball once in six weeks.
I believe in a certain pride in yourself

1186
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:28,163
for your answer.
Why not a ratio gets out of hand or 

1187
01:14:31,121 --> 01:14:34,950
you're an EGOMANIAC?
Something in relation to them.

1188
01:14:36,150 --> 01:14:41,150
Yeah.
Your hygiene habits are pretty good.

1189
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:50,110
Constipated,

1190
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:53,750
15 more seconds.

1191
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:16,020
Your
kids are always giving a success story

1192
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:23,630
were real little.
I had to take care of your and giving us

1193
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:29,810
all innovations that didn't work out.
We didn't meet

1194
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:43,950
interested in legs and feet.
It's very difficult.

1195
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:47,283
Well,
that gives you some indication of a 

1196
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:54,700
Freudian family.
It's not pretty good luck on the exam on

1197
01:15:55,791 --> 01:15:57,560
Thursday.
As you know already the.

1198
01:15:57,740 --> 01:16:00,530
There are lots of sample questions 
posted on the net,

1199
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:04,250
so it's all.
It's here right.
