00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,283
Hi there,
this is my message to millennials about 

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:07,710
how to change the world and I would say 
how to change the world properly.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,900
Of course,
the question then is,

4
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:11,790
well,
exactly what do you mean by properly?

5
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:13,620
And of course that's the fundamental 
issue.

6
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:15,600
So I'm going to walk through that a 
little bit.

7
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:19,890
So I'm gonna and I've also got an offer 
to make to any millennials that are,

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,410
are willing to watch this.
So,

9
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,383
um,
this was triggered in part by something 

10
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:26,604
I read recently by Jonathan Haidt and 
Jonathan Haidt is the professor of 

11
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:30,024
ethical leadership at a Nyu stern school
of business and he's been a very astute 

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,973
commentator recently on some of the 
political battles that have been going 

13
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:39,720
on in the social sciences.
I'm noting,

14
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:40,554
for example,
that there is very little political 

15
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:43,044
diversity in the views of social 
scientists and perhaps even less on the 

16
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:47,580
part of the people in the humanities.

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,103
Um,
and hate recently wrote something which 

18
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:51,564
will all put a you linked to in the 
description of this video where he 

19
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:57,354
claimed that universities have to decide
between social justice and truth and on 

20
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:02,454
the side of truth,
he puts a philosopher called named John 

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,083
Stuart Mill and English philosopher who 
said he who knows only his side of the 

22
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:10,254
case knows little of that his reasons 
may be good and no one may have been 

23
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:14,904
able to refute them,
but if he is equally unable to refute 

24
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:19,470
the reasons on the opposite side,
if he does not,

25
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,050
he does not so much as know what they 
are.

26
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,360
He has no grown for preferring either 
opinion.

27
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,380
And then he juxtaposes John Stuart mill 
with Karl Marx who said,

28
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:31,200
the philosophers have only interpreted 
the world in various ways.

29
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,243
The point is to change it.
He considers marks the patron saint of 

30
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,443
social justice university,
which is oriented around changing the 

31
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:42,090
world in part by overthrowing power 
structures and privilege.

32
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,870
It sees political diversity as an 
obstacle to action.

33
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,760
Male,
on the other hand,

34
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:48,594
according to hate,
is the patron saint of what he calls 

35
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:51,430
truth.
You would,

36
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:52,264
she's truth as a process in which flawed
individuals challenging each other's 

37
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,520
biased and incomplete reasoning and in 
the process all become smarter,

38
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,013
hate points out the truth.
University dies when it becomes 

39
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:05,220
intellectually uniform or politically 
orthodox.

40
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,383
So I guess this video is in part my call
along with Jonathan Haidt for young 

41
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:12,504
people to join truth university,
but there's a problem with that because 

42
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:18,960
the university is where the truth is 
being sought.

43
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,853
That's the university,
but there's a problem and that is that 

44
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:24,750
young people want to change the world 
and it's part of what piaget,

45
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:25,584
the developmental psychologists,
piaget called the messianic stage and 

46
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:32,580
there's some real utility in that 
because we're social creatures and,

47
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,930
um,
as we construct ourselves and,

48
00:02:35,931 --> 00:02:36,764
and formulate ourselves and bring our 
own character into being predicated on 

49
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:42,060
our,
on our biological,

50
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,490
a platform,
our biological being.

51
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,710
We also simultaneously have to 
integrate,

52
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,723
adjust to,
integrate with and negotiate with 

53
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:51,630
society which sometimes needs to be 
changed.

54
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,330
The structure of society has to be 
preserved,

55
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,100
but it has to be updated and improved as
it moves forward.

56
00:02:57,101 --> 00:03:01,420
And so part of the problem is how to 
update and improve it without doing that

57
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:04,150
so rapidly that you destroy everything 
of any value.

58
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,540
So the problem I have with the Marxist 
perspective,

59
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,460
and I've had this problem with it for a 
long time,

60
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:13,000
is that I don't think that you should 
trust people whose primary goal,

61
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,650
when,
when,

62
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,693
when they're attempting to change the 
world for the better is to change other 

63
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:18,574
people.
And you can tell who those people are 

64
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:22,270
because they're always blaming other 
people and they're looking for victims.

65
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:23,920
They're looking for perpetrators and 
victims.

66
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,260
And then they're going off to stop the 
perpetrators.

67
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,130
And I think that's wrong because as 
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn said,

68
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:32,860
he's a great Russian writer who helped 
bring down the Soviet Union.

69
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,220
He said the line between good and evil 
runs down every,

70
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,980
every human's heart.
So,

71
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,240
so the real battle as far as I'm 
concerned,

72
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:41,074
and I think this goes along with the 
tradition in which John Stuart mill is 

73
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,123
firmly placed and is that to overcome 
tyranny and malevolence and chaos and 

74
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:50,944
nihilism,
and the desire to bring everything to a 

75
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:55,870
halt.
You have to repair the fissures.

76
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:58,960
And the and the riff that's in your own 
soul basically,

77
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,310
and that means that you have to confront
the evil that lives in your own heart.

78
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:04,144
And there's a,
there's a statement from the New 

79
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:05,944
Testament that I think is very much 
apropos with regards to this particular 

80
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:11,320
idea.
And this is a car.

81
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,810
There's this part of the sermon on the 
mount,

82
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,300
which is a central text in,
in Western,

83
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:17,134
in the western tradition,
I would say obviously central to 

84
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:19,144
Christianity,
but central to everything that Western 

85
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:22,330
civilization has built.

86
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,080
And so Christ says to his followers,
um,

87
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,770
why behold thou the moat that is in your
brother's eye,

88
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,113
but consider it's not the beam that is 
in [inaudible] or how will they'll say 

89
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:37,770
to thy brother,
let me pull out the mote out of Sinai.

90
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,870
And behold,
a beam is in Dine Oni.

91
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,710
Thou hypocrite first cast out the beam 
out of the nine Onei.

92
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,150
And then shalt thou see clearly to cast 
out of thy brother's eye.

93
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,890
While I like that quote,
because it places the responsibility for

94
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,610
change at every level of being on the 
individual.

95
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,100
And obviously the individual interacts 
with society.

96
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:00,934
But the idea here is that unless the 
individual straightens out his or her 

97
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:04,774
own soul,
there is no possibility that the impact 

98
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:09,310
the individual can have on society can 
be anything,

99
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:12,820
but let's say harmful in proportion to 
the harm that's still in the soul.

100
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,983
These are important things to know.
There are vitally important things to 

101
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:17,680
know.
So okay,

102
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:18,514
so.
But then we're faced with a conundrum 

103
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:21,580
that young people also want to change 
the world.

104
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:23,260
But that's no problem because I think 
you can bring.

105
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,220
You can bring truth university together 
with a desire to,

106
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,590
to make real change,
but change,

107
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,200
change,
change has to start in the right place.

108
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,063
So I'm going to tell you how I think you
should change yourself so that you can 

109
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:37,780
change the world.
And so the,

110
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,320
the world that you bring into being will
be a better world in order.

111
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:41,620
Worst one,
remember,

112
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,750
remember,
you need to know about this,

113
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:44,584
that the world that the followers of 
mark's brought into being in the 20th 

114
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:51,070
century killed more than 100 million 
people say in China and Russia,

115
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,700
the Soviet Union,
and in places like Cambodia and Vietnam,

116
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,920
the world certainly changed as a 
consequence Marxist doctrine,

117
00:05:57,921 --> 00:05:59,960
but it didn't change in in a good 
direction.

118
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,793
And of course the Marxist doctrine is,
is making itself heard in a massive way 

119
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:06,320
across the west again.
Now.

120
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,310
So.
All right,

121
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:09,620
so what should you do about that?
Well,

122
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,880
here,
here's an idea.

123
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,240
The first thing you have to do is Orient
Yourself.

124
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,460
Now you probably have all watched 
Pinocchio.

125
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,443
Pinocchio was about how a Marionette,
someone whose whose strings are being 

126
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:22,850
pulled by forces beyond his 
comprehension.

127
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,840
That's the situation of the undeveloped 
individual Japan Eto,

128
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:29,030
who's a benevolent father,
so benevolent,

129
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,790
a symbol,
a symbol of benevolent culture,

130
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,870
makes a puppet his son,
and then wishes on a star.

131
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:36,704
Now,
a star is something that glitters up in 

132
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:38,780
the sky and it's,
and it's,

133
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:42,170
it's associated with the transcendent 
and the beyond and the divine.

134
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:44,120
And you know,
if you look up in the night sky and it's

135
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:46,490
very dark,
you get a feeling of arts because you're

136
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:48,710
confronting your soul,
so to speak.

137
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,190
Your individual soul is confronting the 
cosmos and you can feel the relationship

138
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:55,430
between you and and and,
and the totality.

139
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:58,310
So looking up into the sky as a like a 
religious experience,

140
00:06:58,311 --> 00:06:59,144
if it's a starry sky,
and to wish upon a star is to find in a 

141
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,760
light that orients you like the North 
Star,

142
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,013
and to pick a highest goal,
to pick the highest school you can 

143
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:09,920
conceive of.
And so that's what Japan does.

144
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:10,754
He raises his eyes above his,
his day to day concerns and tries to 

145
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,690
establish a relationship with the 
highest of all possible values.

146
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,340
And,
and,

147
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:20,174
and he has the most profound of wishes.
And the most profound of wishes is that 

148
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:27,860
the puppet that he's created could 
become a genuine individual,

149
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:28,970
genuinely,
fully,

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,833
fully developed human being.
And that's what you can wish for 

151
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,730
yourself.
That you can wish and,

152
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:34,271
and,
and,

153
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:35,990
and aim for that in yourself.

154
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,600
And then you see,
that's how you deal with the suffering.

155
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:39,434
That's attendant on life because life is
suffering and because life is very hard 

156
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:43,334
and people get sick and they they become
mentally ill and and and there's 

157
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:49,370
malevolence in the world and there's 
tragedy and so life is very,

158
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:53,120
very hard and if you're not properly 
oriented with regards to life,

159
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:56,270
the fact that it's hard and the fact 
that it's full of suffering can,

160
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,550
can warp and twist and bend you until 
you become murderous and resentful and,

161
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,560
and even go beyond murders and 
resentment to wish for,

162
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,603
for genocide and evil,
even to wish for the destruction of 

163
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:07,244
everything.
And so you have to learn how to 

164
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:10,394
strengthen yourself as an individual so 
that you can bear the burden of being 

165
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:14,744
without becoming corrupt.
You have to decide that that is what 

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,833
you're aiming for,
is that you want to become a fully 

167
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:19,784
developed human being and start being a 
pathetic marionette whose strings are 

168
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:25,310
being pulled by horrible forces behind 
the scenes.

169
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,840
So I would say to any to wish on a star 
is to aim at the highest good.

170
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:31,010
And the question then is,
well,

171
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,300
what?
What is the good?

172
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,300
Well,
we can answer that in two ways.

173
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,290
We could say that the good is the 
opposite of evil and I can tell you what

174
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,124
evil is.
Evil is the conscious desire to produce 

175
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:44,084
suffering were suffering is not 
necessary and so if you read about what 

176
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:49,340
happened in the Nazi concentration 
camps,

177
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:50,174
for example,
or in the in the Russian concentration 

178
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:53,930
camps during the Soviet time of the 
Soviet Union,

179
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:54,764
you get a good flavor for what 
constitutes evil and evil is the desire 

180
00:08:57,961 --> 00:09:00,180
to exploit the vulnerability of other 
people,

181
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:01,014
to self consciously exploit the 
vulnerability of other people and to 

182
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:04,134
elevate their suffering beyond there or 
anyone's ability to tolerate and so the 

183
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:08,274
good is the opposite of that.
Whatever the opposite of that is the 

184
00:09:10,691 --> 00:09:12,060
good is harder to get a handle on.

185
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,760
But here's one hint,
and I got this from reading.

186
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:15,594
John Piaget,
partly who's a developmental 

187
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:17,694
psychologist and Piaget talked about the
elevated state and then the state is 

188
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:26,760
like a game that children play where 
every child wants to play the game.

189
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,653
You have a little social group and 
that's the children's playgroup and any 

190
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:31,074
of the individuals within it.
Those are the individual children and 

191
00:09:32,901 --> 00:09:33,734
the and the structure is the game and 
it's a good game if everyone wants to 

192
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:37,854
play it.
And and Piaget noted that a game like 

193
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:44,370
that will outperform a game that people 
have to be tyrannized to play because it

194
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,580
doesn't entail.
It doesn't require any enforcement cost.

195
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,953
And so I've,
I've sort of developed the idea of Neil 

196
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,833
equilibrated state to think that if,
if you're aiming at the good then you 

197
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:56,874
want what's good for you and I mean good
for you as if you were taking care of 

198
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:00,294
yourself and we're good to yourself who 
were treating yourself like someone you 

199
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:03,414
loved,
that it was good for you in a way that 

200
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:05,904
would also be good for your family and 
then it would be good for you and your 

201
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:11,580
family in a way that was also good for 
society.

202
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,593
And then it would be good for you and 
your family and society in a way that 

203
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:17,244
would be good for the world.
And then it would be good now and it 

204
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:22,200
would be good next week and the week 
after,

205
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,380
and a year from now and as long into the
future as you can see.

206
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:26,214
So the good is something that's 
equivalent rated across multiple levels 

207
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:30,234
of being in multiple timeframes 
simultaneously and it isn't necessarily 

208
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:35,760
that you know what that is going to be 
at any given moment,

209
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:39,240
but you can orient yourself so that's 
the state that you want to exist in.

210
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:43,710
And I can tell you as far as I can tell,
when you exist in that state,

211
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,473
even moment by moment,
your life is imbued with a sense of 

212
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:51,750
meaning and that sense of meaning can 
help you transcend suffering.

213
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,040
The philosopher Nietzsche said,
he who has a why can bear anyhow,

214
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,960
he who has a why can bear anyhow and so 
niches.

215
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,970
Idea was that if there was purpose in 
your life,

216
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,980
have sufficient grandier that not only 
could the suffering in life be accepted,

217
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,073
but maybe could even be appreciated.
Like it could be that you're willing to 

218
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:14,874
bear the burden of being because of the 
exciting things that you can do with 

219
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:19,254
being the things you can build in,
the things that you can bring about and 

220
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:22,674
that might be the highest imaginable 
state of being and that's that's a form 

221
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:26,094
of paradise,
but it's not a paradise that you 

222
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:28,314
attained by transforming others.
It's a paradise that you attain by 

223
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:31,674
transforming yourself and that's a very 
difficult thing to do and it's a very 

224
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:37,020
frightening thing to do because it means
that you're.

225
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:41,580
You're retooling your soul and that's.
That's a job for a real.

226
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,863
That's the job for a forthright and 
honorable person and it's an exciting 

227
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,124
enough task so that it will keep you 
occupied for the rest of your life and 

228
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:50,940
then magical things will happen to you 
while you're.

229
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,073
While you're doing it and the world will
itself around you in the most wonderful 

230
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:56,380
way,
in a musical way.

231
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,423
So that every part of what you're 
experiencing plays off against every 

232
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:05,380
other part in a manner that's has 
meaning embedded in every aspect of it.

233
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,660
And you experienced that by the way you 
experienced that.

234
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,460
When you listen to a piece of music that
you love,

235
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:11,740
music represents that,
and that's why people.

236
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,870
That's why Mira music nourishes the 
soul.

237
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:15,310
Why?
It's the highest form of art,

238
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,393
at least in my opinion.
So you have to live your life as if 

239
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,710
being is as symphony and you're playing,
you're playing your instrumental part.

240
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,790
Once you Orient Yourself,
then you have an obligation,

241
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,010
I would say an obligation to the 
development of your soul,

242
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:55,680
to speak the truth.
You have to be oriented properly.

243
00:12:55,681 --> 00:12:56,514
They'll because the truth is,
is something that exists in service to 

244
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:00,660
an ideal,
an ideal of sorts.

245
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,090
Then you can imagine that you could use 
your language two ways.

246
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:03,924
You can use your language to manipulate 
the world and to extract from it what 

247
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:08,580
you want.
So for example,

248
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:09,414
maybe you go out into date with someone 
and you decide that the end goal of the 

249
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,550
date is to have a sexual partner for the
night.

250
00:13:14,551 --> 00:13:18,270
And then you can craft your language to 
manipulate the person into providing you

251
00:13:18,271 --> 00:13:19,104
with you with what you want.
And that's like an instrumental use of 

252
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:24,420
language,
but the problem with that,

253
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:26,040
there's many problems with that,
but one of them is,

254
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,890
is that what if your idea about what you
should want is wrong,

255
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:29,724
like maybe that's not the way to treat 
someone that you're on a date out on a 

256
00:13:32,371 --> 00:13:33,570
date with maybe.

257
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:38,810
Maybe you're minimizing and reducing the
interactions between you from what could

258
00:13:39,811 --> 00:13:40,644
be a healthy and elevated state of 
interaction and discourse to something 

259
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:46,554
that's that basically the pursuit of 
impulsive pleasure and not maybe that's 

260
00:13:50,821 --> 00:13:51,654
not good for you.
Next week and the week after a month 

261
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:54,804
down the road,
maybe orienting yourself towards 

262
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:59,790
impulsive pleasure is a very bad idea.
Remember what happens in Pinocchio.

263
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,043
Pinocchio goes to Pleasure Island and 
pleasure island is a place where 

264
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:06,540
impulsive pleasures can be had at at a 
moment's notice,

265
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,360
but what Pinocchio discovers along with 
Jimminy Cricket,

266
00:14:09,361 --> 00:14:14,070
that pleasure island is run by masked 
totalitarians.

267
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,450
There.
They're all dressed in black.

268
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:16,340
You remember?
They're,

269
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,220
they're turning the children and 
adolescents who are on pleasure island.

270
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:21,683
They're depriving them of their voice,
turning them into bring jackasses and 

271
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:26,430
preparing to sell them as slaves to the 
salt mines,

272
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:27,264
and so there's an implication in that 
story that the pursuit of impulsive 

273
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:34,440
pleasure is one route to totalitarianism
and slavery,

274
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,283
and I believe that so perhaps orienting 
your language towards the gathering of 

275
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:43,800
the impulsive pleasure is a miss,
is a misuse of your highest gift.

276
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,350
The gift of logos,
that gift of communication.

277
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:47,603
The alternative is to Orient Yourself 
towards the highest good as we already 

278
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:52,400
described it,
and then the truth which and you can.

279
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,220
You can tell when you're doing that 
because you can tell her when you're not

280
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:57,470
doing that because if you're.
If you're not telling the truth,

281
00:14:57,471 --> 00:14:58,304
if you're using someone else's words,
you're being manipulated in a sense by 

282
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:05,090
forces that are behind the scenes.
You're not using your own words.

283
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,193
You're the puppet of an ideology or 
another thinker or your own impulsive 

284
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:11,084
desires and you can tell when you're 
speaking like that because it makes you 

285
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:14,234
feel weak.
It makes you feel weak and ashamed and 

286
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:18,050
you can localize that feeling 
physiologically.

287
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:18,884
If you listen to yourself talk,
you can tell when when you're speaking 

288
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:23,834
properly,
you will experience a feeling of 

289
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:26,564
integration and strength and when you're
speaking in a deceitful or manipulative 

290
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:31,610
manner,
you'll feel that you're starting to come

291
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:32,444
across apart at the seams and what you 
need to do is practice only saying 

292
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:38,960
things that make you feel stronger and 
that'll mean to begin with.

293
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,330
You'll notice that almost everything you
say is a lie.

294
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,490
It's either a lie or someone else's 
words.

295
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,473
It's very hard to find your own words,
but you don't actually exist until you 

296
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:49,460
have your own words,
so okay,

297
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:50,294
so then you.
You try to teach yourself how to speak 

298
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:53,654
your own truth and you listen to other 
people while you're doing that because 

299
00:15:55,851 --> 00:15:58,940
they can help you shape and correct your
words.

300
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,480
They'll react to them badly if you 
formulate your ideas badly,

301
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:03,314
and if you listen and pay attention,
then you can learn to formulate your 

302
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:07,250
words more and more clearly and 
accurately,

303
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:08,870
and that makes you more and more 
powerful.

304
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,780
It makes you.
It gives you more and more authority,

305
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:14,450
which is the which is the beneficial 
form of power.

306
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,330
Okay,
so you do that and then you have to make

307
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:18,164
a decision of faith and that's basically
where you can easily either use your 

308
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:21,674
language to manipulate the world and 
make it do what you want or you can use 

309
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:29,840
your language to try to articulate the 
truth as carefully as you possibly can,

310
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,420
and then you can see what happens.

311
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,220
You have to let go of your desire for 
the for the consequences that you want.

312
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:39,560
You have to assume that if you speak the
truth,

313
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,873
the results are the best that is 
possible under the circumstances and so 

314
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:44,600
it's a.
it's a.

315
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,610
it's an exciting way of living in 
simpsons.

316
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,473
Some sense it's like continually walking
off a cliff because you don't know 

317
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:53,300
what's going to happen next.
If all you do is say what you think,

318
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,423
you know,
and maybe you're at work and you say 

319
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:56,390
what you think and you get fired and you
think,

320
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,100
oh my God,
that's a terrible catastrophe,

321
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:58,934
but maybe it's not.
Because maybe if you're working 

322
00:17:00,651 --> 00:17:03,860
somewhere and you have to lie to 
maintain your job,

323
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:04,694
maybe you shouldn't be there.
Maybe it's deadening your soul and 

324
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:07,424
damaging you in some permanent manner 
and making you corrupt and so you have 

325
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:12,950
to Orient Yourself.

326
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,980
You have to speak the truth as carefully
as you can,

327
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:15,814
and you have to listen to others so that
you correct your speech and then you 

328
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:23,210
have to allow the consequences that 
ensue to unfold as they will.

329
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,280
That's the ultimate act of faith,
I would say,

330
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,710
and that's what you do.
If you belong to truth university.

331
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,050
All right,
so more practically speaking,

332
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,240
then you should educate yourself and 
it's not that easy to do now because you

333
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:36,074
have to find people who can actually 
tell you mostly what to read and maybe 

334
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:39,584
also how to write because writing is a 
way of formulating your thoughts 

335
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:44,450
evermore precisely.
That's why you go to university to learn

336
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:45,850
how to write.
If you learn,

337
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,540
if you know how to write,
you can think.

338
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,460
If you can think and speak and 
communicate in writing,

339
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,643
you're unbelievably powerful in the 
authority manner because arguments move 

340
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:02,520
the world forward and if your arguments 
are tight and well constructed and lucid

341
00:18:02,521 --> 00:18:06,300
and well edited and carefully thought 
through and you have five rationales for

342
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:07,134
everything that you're doing,
which is what happens if you learn to 

343
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,040
write properly,
then you're like a force of nature,

344
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:11,520
man.

345
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,353
No one can take you down and that's one 
of the things that people aren't taught 

346
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:16,320
about.
Why you go get educated,

347
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:19,440
especially in the humanities,
humanities education,

348
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:23,040
if it's real,
organizes your psyche grounds.

349
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:27,150
You puts you on a rock and makes you a 
force to contend with,

350
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,990
but you have to read the right people 
and so and those are the great,

351
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,103
the great people of the past in my list.
They're the great men of the past and 

352
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:38,670
that's just how it is,
and so here's who I would recommend.

353
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:41,340
I put reading lists up at Jordan B 
Peterson Dotcom.

354
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:42,174
There's two of them and the people that 
I recommend primarily are there books 

355
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:48,450
written by the following list of people,
Theodore,

356
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:49,284
Dostoevsky and Tolstoy,
who I think perhaps the greatest 

357
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:54,690
novelist the world has ever seen.
Alexander Solzhenitsyn,

358
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:55,524
another great Russian novelist.
I don't know what it is about the 

359
00:18:57,181 --> 00:18:58,170
Russians,
but man,

360
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,130
they produce.

361
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,710
They produce.
Writers that are in comparable.

362
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,873
Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote a book 
called the Gulag archipelago where he 

363
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:10,200
analyzed the Soviet prison camp system 
that arose after the leninist revolution

364
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:15,120
in the second decade of the 20th century
and details and absolutely precisely how

365
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:15,954
the tenants of Marxism,
Marxists tenants that are supposed to 

366
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:23,160
free everyone and changed the world 
produced legislation that was,

367
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,053
that was absolutely murderous in its 
consequences and social units and 

368
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,433
painstakingly traces the logical pathway
from the original Marxist principles to 

369
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,504
the legislation to the to the genocides.
Because you'll hear people who are 

370
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:39,180
basically Marxist to say things like,
well,

371
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,710
true Marxism never existed and social 
units.

372
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,553
And took that.
That argument apart in the in the mid 

373
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,480
seventies and and the gulag.
Archipelago was an intellectual bomb.

374
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:49,314
It,
it,

375
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,573
it demolished any credibility that 
Marxism had to intellectual 

376
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:55,260
respectability.
You have to read the book.

377
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,890
The book is about the central issue in 
our culture at the moment.

378
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,570
If you don't read it,
you're not informed.

379
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,150
You can't participate in the debate 
except as a puppet.

380
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,140
And so I wouldn't recommend 
participating in this debate as a puppet

381
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:09,990
because you don't know who's behind the 
scenes pulling the strings.

382
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,530
If you remember the Pinocchio Story,
the forces that were pulling the strings

383
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:14,850
were not,
uh,

384
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,940
they were not forces that we're acting 
in Pinocchio's best interest,

385
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:20,070
that's for sure.
George Orwell,

386
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:20,963
English essayist in comparable 
commentator on socialist 

387
00:20:23,551 --> 00:20:24,384
totalitarianism,
even though he was a left winger and a 

388
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:28,710
brilliant one.
Aldous Huxley wrote Brave New World,

389
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,863
uh,
had some very brilliant things to say 

390
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:33,150
about the potential demolition of sexual
choice,

391
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,930
of choice of sexual partner as a part of
part of a dystopian future.

392
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,003
Friedrich Nietzsche,
the philosopher who described himself 

393
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:44,970
as,
as someone who thought with a hammer and

394
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,863
Nietzsche is a very,
very dangerous person and an absolutely 

395
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:48,400
brilliant writer.

396
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,810
And Carl Young,
who was a student of Nisha and who Nisha

397
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:53,644
was the philosopher who I announced the 
death of God back in the late 18 

398
00:20:56,111 --> 00:21:00,700
hundreds and spent his whole life 
attempting to revivify God.

399
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,750
That's one way of thinking about it.
And so if you educate yourself,

400
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:06,070
and this is a really good place to 
start.

401
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:08,380
If you read these authors,
then you'll know what else to read.

402
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:09,580
If you read these authors,
it'll,

403
00:21:09,581 --> 00:21:11,560
it'll take you a good long time and it 
will be very,

404
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,394
very hard on you and,
and you won't be the same person when 

405
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,270
you come out.
And that's very frightening.

406
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,890
And because being torn down and rebuilt 
is no is no joke,

407
00:21:20,891 --> 00:21:22,540
but it beats the hell out of the 
alternative,

408
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:26,050
which is just to stagnate and stay as 
stagnant infant,

409
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,930
which is,
which is not something I'd recommend.

410
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:32,800
There's nothing uglier than a stagnant 
40 year old infant.

411
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,650
So that's equivalent.
Just so you know,

412
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:37,600
to Pinocchio,
Back to the Pinocchio Story,

413
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,240
rescuing Japan from the underworld.
Remember when he was,

414
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,343
he had kind of turned into a half 
jackass after being at the at pleasure 

415
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:45,304
island,
where he was enticed by the way from a 

416
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,183
couple of people who that was the Fox 
and the cat who attempted to entice 

417
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:54,040
himself into believing that he was a 
victim and needed a vacation.

418
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,730
So Pinocchio was enticed onto pleasure 
island by two,

419
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,773
two fingers that that played on his 
sense of victimization and neurosis and 

420
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:04,230
suffering to convince him that he didn't
have to.

421
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,060
He didn't have to take any 
responsibility for his own existence and

422
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:09,640
he could just be busy himself with 
impulsive pleasures.

423
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:11,680
Right?
That's how we fell into the hands of the

424
00:22:11,681 --> 00:22:13,930
totalitarians on pleasure island.
Um,

425
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,180
anyways,
Pinocchio,

426
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,810
after he left,
pleasure island had to go into the ocean

427
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:20,290
twice.

428
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,060
And the second time he went into the 
ocean,

429
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:23,470
he was looking for his father.
Well,

430
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,920
everyone's father from a mythological 
perspective,

431
00:22:26,921 --> 00:22:31,921
is dying in the underworld,
in the chaos because everyone inhabits a

432
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:34,750
culture that's sick and old,
so to speak.

433
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:35,584
And it's sick and old because it was 
made by the dad and the living have to 

434
00:22:38,111 --> 00:22:38,944
revivify it continually in order for it 
to be a dynamic force and the living 

435
00:22:42,101 --> 00:22:42,934
have to revive a fi,
their connection with the culture 

436
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:46,600
internally too,
because your constructions of culture,

437
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:47,434
although not only constructions of 
culture and you have to understand 

438
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,540
history because otherwise you can't 
understand yourself.

439
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:56,260
You're a historical creature and so you 
have to rescue your dead father from the

440
00:22:56,261 --> 00:22:59,440
belly of the beast,
from the Dragon Guess Remember the whale

441
00:22:59,441 --> 00:23:01,420
in Pinocchio is also a fire breathing 
dragon.

442
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,690
And that means you have to face the 
thing that you most fear.

443
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,273
And when you do that,
you'll rescue your father from the 

444
00:23:07,571 --> 00:23:10,900
underworld.
These are very complex ideas and you can

445
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:13,060
read about them in my book.
Maps of meaning if you want.

446
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:13,894
It's on the reading list.
I put a free copy of it on Jordan would 

447
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:18,310
be Peterson Dotcom.
So you can download it.

448
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,350
I take apart these sorts of things in 
detail.

449
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,603
So anyways,
you have to vivify your father before 

450
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:25,230
you can become real.
And,

451
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,440
and that's part of the problem with the 
feminist and feminist and social justice

452
00:23:30,461 --> 00:23:32,950
warrior insistence on the existence of 
the patriarchy.

453
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:35,740
It's like everyone's known since the 
beginning of time,

454
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:39,700
that culture is corrupt and tyrannical,
but it's also protective and benevolent.

455
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:41,860
Even the language use is a product of 
culture,

456
00:23:41,861 --> 00:23:44,260
and so you don't overthrow the 
patriarchy,

457
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,243
you a fire your culture,
and you do that by adopting 

458
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:48,884
responsibility for your own being and 
then acting as a moral agent in the 

459
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:54,560
culture.
That's what you do to become educated.

460
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:56,900
So read these books,
read these books.

461
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:58,400
They'll change your life.
I guarantee it.

462
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:00,350
They'll change your life.
They'll take you apart,

463
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,393
they'll devastate you,
and then they'll rebuild you into 

464
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:04,820
something far greater than you are now.

465
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,740
But don't worry,
Jenny,

466
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,563
you need to get yourself out.
Follow the chamber and you'll find 

467
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,940
wrong.
You will bring in folks,

468
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,970
I just wasn't quick enough.
Phoenix tears have healing powers

469
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:09,230
and that's what to aim for.
So then,

470
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,093
and here's something that will help you.
My colleagues and I have developed a 

471
00:25:12,441 --> 00:25:15,620
series of online writing programs called
the cell phone ring suite,

472
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,873
and they help people write about their 
past and organize that and they're 

473
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,323
present personality and organize and 
understand that and then the future and 

474
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,613
the future authoring program asks you to
write about six different dimensions of 

475
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:32,690
your life so it asked you first of all,
treat yourself as if you're someone that

476
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:36,530
you want to help and that someone that 
you love and take care of it and someone

477
00:25:36,531 --> 00:25:38,570
that you want to help and then it asked 
you.

478
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:39,404
Well,
if you could,

479
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:43,400
if you could organize your life in the 
best possible manner and in keeping with

480
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:47,060
those principles we discussed earlier,
what do you want?

481
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,390
What do you want for your career?
Like what do you want?

482
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,760
What would make your life meaningful?
What do you want for your career?

483
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,160
What do you want for your family and 
from your family?

484
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:56,900
What do you want for an intimate 
relationship?

485
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,633
How are you going to handle?
How are you going to take care of your 

486
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,150
mental and physical health?
How are you going to handle drug,

487
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,043
drug and alcohol use?
It asks you a series of fundamental 

488
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:09,680
questions like that to get your mind 
moving and then it asks you to write for

489
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:10,514
15 minutes about what your life could be
like 53 to five years in the future if 

490
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,374
it was laid out like you were laying out
a life for someone you deeply cared 

491
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:18,554
about and so you're asked to write for 
15 minutes about that without worrying 

492
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:22,094
too much about structure,
the structure of the argument or or or 

493
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,920
any grammatical niceties that that's put
off for later.

494
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,140
So that gives you a little heaven name 
for it,

495
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:30,730
right?
It's like,

496
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:31,970
well,
if I could have this,

497
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:32,804
my life would be clearly worthwhile.
Even if I had to put up with a fair bit 

498
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:35,954
of suffering along the way.
That's what you're trying to construct 

499
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,400
and you could think about that as a 
heaven worth moving towards.

500
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,653
And then the second part of the program 
asked to write about what your life 

501
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:46,830
would be like three to five years down 
the road.

502
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:47,664
If all of your bad habits and nihilistic
tendencies and proclivity towards 

503
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:54,570
resentment and lack of desire to 
shoulder responsibility,

504
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,463
fall your weak points,
got the upper hand and just augured you 

505
00:26:57,421 --> 00:27:00,540
into the ground and everyone knows that 
you know what you'd be like.

506
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:01,374
If you just let everything slide and and
you know what particular hell you were 

507
00:27:04,141 --> 00:27:07,980
ended up heading towards and so the sec,
the second part of the program asked you

508
00:27:07,981 --> 00:27:08,814
to write about what your life would be 
like three to five years down the road 

509
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,173
if everything just went to hell around 
you and so that gives you a hell to 

510
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:15,504
avoid and heaven to strive for and you 
need both of those because that's what 

511
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:20,040
keeps you properly motivated in life.

512
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,383
And then the second half of the program 
that the next part of the program helps 

513
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:29,370
you turn your vision of the desirable 
future into an implementable reality and

514
00:27:29,371 --> 00:27:30,204
to articulate it fully and to articulate
the arguments for why you want that and 

515
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:36,420
those even help you overcome your own 
doubts.

516
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:37,254
Right?
It's not only to argue against other 

517
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:38,814
people,
it's to argue against the chattering 

518
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:41,034
demons of nihilism and hopelessness and 
the ideological possession that that 

519
00:27:44,941 --> 00:27:47,370
exist in your mind and in society 
simultaneously.

520
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:50,100
You need powerful weapons to fight back 
against those.

521
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,533
So here's an offer for you.
We've made the future authoring program 

522
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:57,110
available free for the next while.
I'm,

523
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,013
I don't know how long a while be,
but let's assume a week or something 

524
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:00,714
like that.
And so if you go to ww dot [inaudible] 

525
00:28:05,461 --> 00:28:10,461
dot com slash future authoring dot html,
you can read about the program there and

526
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,143
now I got to tell you,
we've used this program and about 5,000 

527
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:18,144
university students so far,
mostly in Holland but some in Canada as 

528
00:28:20,311 --> 00:28:21,030
well.

529
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,360
And what we've shown is that they,
the program,

530
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,243
if you complete this program,
even if you do it badly and I would 

531
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:29,100
recommend it,
do it badly,

532
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:30,060
man,
it doesn't matter.

533
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:31,800
You don't have to do it perfectly.
Do it badly,

534
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:33,510
and then maybe do it better as you move 
forward,

535
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:34,344
but at least do it badly.
It increases the performance of 

536
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:37,914
university students.
It increases their grades by between 20 

537
00:28:39,811 --> 00:28:43,590
and 25 percent and decreases their 
dropout by about the same percent,

538
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:44,424
and so we have data on 5,000 people.
One of those papers is been published 

539
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:49,620
and I'll put that in the,
in the description,

540
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:50,843
in the description of this video,
and so this program really works if you 

541
00:28:53,161 --> 00:28:56,700
do it and and so I would highly 
recommend that you do it anyways.

542
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,250
You can read about the program there.
Click purchase for $14,

543
00:29:00,251 --> 00:29:02,670
95.
Then enter this code,

544
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,833
change yourself,
that'll give you a 1495 discount and 

545
00:29:07,321 --> 00:29:08,910
that means you can have the program for 
free.

546
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,280
And so here's what millennials should 
do.

547
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:14,220
If they want to change the world,
the first thing they should do is orient

548
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:17,910
themselves to the good and that's away 
from evil,

549
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:18,744
away from malevolence,
away from the manufacturer of pointless 

550
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:22,644
suffering and pain away from Auschwitz,
let's say in a way from the Gulag 

551
00:29:25,471 --> 00:29:26,304
archipelago and the terrible Soviet 
camps and the massive murders that 

552
00:29:29,221 --> 00:29:30,054
occurred in China.
You want to get it and you want to get 

553
00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:33,450
as far away from that as you possibly 
can.

554
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,600
Whatever direction is away from that is 
a good direction,

555
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,123
and then you also wanted to contemplate 
what the highest possible good could 

556
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:43,450
look like for you and your family and 
your society.

557
00:29:43,451 --> 00:29:44,284
We already discussed that and then you 
need to speak the truth in relationship 

558
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:48,394
to that,
and then you need to educate yourself 

559
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,660
and then you need to shoulder you're 
responsibility.

560
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,130
Responsibility is a good thing because 
it makes you strong to bear up under.

561
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:59,220
It makes you strong.
You can turn yourself into a.

562
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,273
You can free yourself from your strings 
and turn yourself into a genuine 

563
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:03,814
individual and then you can shoulder the
world and then you're in a position to 

564
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:10,270
make to make change.
As a person like that,

565
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,253
your mirror being will change the world 
in a positive direction and that's what 

566
00:30:14,591 --> 00:30:15,424
you should be aiming for.
So read the books that I put up on my 

567
00:30:17,831 --> 00:30:18,664
site and do the future authoring program
and that will improve your life 

568
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,920
dramatically and that's how you can 
change the world.
