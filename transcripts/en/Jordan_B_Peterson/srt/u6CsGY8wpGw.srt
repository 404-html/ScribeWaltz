00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,860
Hello everyone.
I've got lots of questions here.

2
00:00:06,861 --> 00:00:11,861
And so welcome to the first live
question and answer youtube session that

3
00:00:11,961 --> 00:00:16,250
I'm hosting.
So I'm going to get right into it and

4
00:00:16,251 --> 00:00:18,830
answer some questions.
There's lots coming up on the screen

5
00:00:18,831 --> 00:00:20,420
here.
Um,

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,750
Mac one three five,
seven one nine seven,

7
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:26,840
nine asks,
what does it mean people don't have

8
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:29,810
ideas,
ideas have people.

9
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,360
Are we okay?
Okay.

10
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,320
Cause I've got an area here.
Sorry about that.

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,660
We're going to,
you're going to hear some technical talk

12
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:40,850
during this because we don't exactly
know what we're doing yet.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,550
Okay.
So what does it mean people don't have

14
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:45,020
ideas,
ideas have people.

15
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,250
I learned that mostly from young.
In fact,

16
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:54,940
I think that's virtually a direct quote
from Carl Jung.

17
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:00,400
One of the things I learned from young
was that it's perfectly reasonable to

18
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:03,070
think of ideas as something that's
living as,

19
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:04,100
as a,
as something that's,

20
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,340
that's a lot.
But an idea is something that's alive.

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,360
And I think the reason for that is that
the beings that have ideas and so that's

22
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:18,181
us.
People are alive and we're trying to use

23
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:22,570
our cognitive ability to further our
living.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,500
And so we create ideas that,
and,

25
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,380
and the,
the purpose of those ideas is to have

26
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:36,950
them played out in embodiment to have
the Mac that acted out because otherwise

27
00:01:36,951 --> 00:01:39,180
did not have any utility.
And so

28
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,570
we conjure up ideas,
let's say originally,

29
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,060
but they take on a life of their own
over time.

30
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,530
And as they take on a life of their own,
their capacity to dominate someone

31
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,700
increases to the point where the idea is
arguably more powerful than the person.

32
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,950
No.
So if you look at religious ideas,

33
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:07,940
for example,
maybe you could think of what happened

34
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,480
with regards to Islam and that,
you know,

35
00:02:11,481 --> 00:02:15,290
end up in the latter part of the first
Christian Millennium,

36
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,010
a set of ideas exploded out of one
source and,

37
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,300
and swept through a vast population.
The same thing happened with

38
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:24,830
Christianity.
In fact,

39
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:27,470
the same thing is happening with
Christianity right now in China,

40
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,620
China,
in,

41
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,421
in,
in China.

42
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:32,450
Christianity is spreading faster than it
did in the Roman times.

43
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,160
And definitely something we already
noticed cause our timeframe is small

44
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:39,140
compared to thousands and thousands of
years.

45
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,310
But ideas have their own goal and their
own perception and their own way of

46
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:50,840
interacting with the world.
And it's,

47
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,450
it's always possible for them to possess
people.

48
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,150
Why do we feel exposed and vulnerable
when we know and do what we really like?

49
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,590
Your words that Zell H,
well

50
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,840
lots of times people hide behind a shelf
even at cost to them because if the

51
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:26,650
shell gets criticized and it's not
really that relevant because it doesn't

52
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,850
have any direct bearing on them.
And so if you're not showing your true

53
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:33,760
self,
so to speak to the world and what you're

54
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:37,480
showing is something essentially this
false or just constructed and that gets

55
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:39,760
criticized,
well you can always comfort yourself

56
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,430
with the idea that it's not really you
that's under attack.

57
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,020
So it doesn't wound to the same degree.
Now,

58
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,790
and I mean that's partly why people
protect themselves with falsehoods and

59
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,810
ideologies and,
and

60
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:02,210
it's an attempt to shield their genuine
vulnerability from assault by the world.

61
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:09,030
But the problem is is that if you don't
allow that vulnerability to manifest

62
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:13,080
itself,
then the probability that you're

63
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,100
actually ever going to get what you
really like or even discover what it is

64
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:19,530
is zero.
So by protecting yourself to that

65
00:04:19,531 --> 00:04:22,650
degree,
you end up losing,

66
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,560
certainly losing it,
what it is that you're most trying to

67
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:27,360
protect.
I mean,

68
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:31,920
I don't want to be cavalier about that
because it's understandable that people

69
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,540
attempt to shield their vulnerability
because the vulnerability isn't just

70
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,720
felt,
it's real and people are fragile and you

71
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:42,180
know,
we're subject to the terrible forces of

72
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,280
nature,
enter the terrible forces of culture.

73
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,620
So
we put all sorts of masks in front of

74
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,370
ourselves so that our exposure is
limited.

75
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,300
People even do that to themselves to
some degree.

76
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,550
If you're front is false enough,
then it's also false to you.

77
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,180
And I suppose people do that to some
degree to protect themselves against

78
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,530
their own self criticisms.

79
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,800
David Guido says,
how can high school teachers best

80
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:16,290
promote virtue,
cultivate morality,

81
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,830
and tackle the meaning crisis in the
face of an increasingly chaotic,

82
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:21,810
violent,
and dehumanized future?

83
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,460
Well,
I would say it isn't obvious to me that

84
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:29,490
the future is increasingly chaotic,
violent,

85
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:32,520
and dehumanized,
that the past was pretty rough.

86
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,850
Now the future is definitely ill
defined.

87
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,260
We don't know what's going to happen and
I think maybe that's more true in in a

88
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:43,080
general sense than it ever has been in
the history of mankind.

89
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,530
But I,
I don't necessarily think that there's

90
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,580
reasons to be particularly pessimistic.
However,

91
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:52,380
the first part of the question I think
is,

92
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,090
is well worth addressing.
How can high school teachers best

93
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,400
promote virtue,
cultivate,

94
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,890
cultivate morality,
and tackle the meaning crisis?

95
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,080
Well,
I think the best way that people in

96
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:08,680
general promote virtue and cultivate
morality is by promoting virtue and

97
00:06:08,681 --> 00:06:10,570
cultivating morality within their own
light.

98
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,200
But I think that in order to do that for
yourself and then also in order to

99
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,120
transmit that information to your
students,

100
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:23,260
you have to understand that morality
isn't a sec of injunctions,

101
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,330
of the nature of don't ever do anything
impulsive that you like,

102
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,240
which is generally how Morrell he's put
forth.

103
00:06:31,241 --> 00:06:32,920
You know,
what you think about morality is

104
00:06:32,921 --> 00:06:36,640
something that a puritanical person
might preach.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,660
And that it has to do mostly with self
control and self constraint.

106
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,620
I,
I think that that's a very shallow,

107
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,070
that's a very shell shallow vision of
morality.

108
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,210
I think the way that you convince people
to act morally if that's something that

109
00:06:56,881 --> 00:07:01,380
you're interested in doing is to
meditate on the utility of the truth

110
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,710
because I think the highest form of
morality is following the truth.

111
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,030
So you might say,
well,

112
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:10,950
why would you bother following?
What's true and answer to that I think

113
00:07:10,951 --> 00:07:14,880
is quite straight forward.
If you follow what's false,

114
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:18,150
then you're going to end up somewhere
that you weren't planning to go and the

115
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:20,640
probability that that's going to be good
is low.

116
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,050
Me following what's false,
it's like attempting to use the wrong

117
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:28,230
map for,
for for the territory that you occupy.

118
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,140
And if your eyes are opening and you pay
attention,

119
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,450
then the probability that you'll be able
to maneuver around the terrible,

120
00:07:36,451 --> 00:07:40,680
sharp obstacles that will emerge in
front of you is that much higher.

121
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,260
And so when you were having a serious
discussion about morality with people,

122
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,750
there's a,
there's a couple of points that you'd

123
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,220
make to begin with.
It's like,

124
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,680
and these were fundamental points.
One would be do you want things to be

125
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:58,620
better or do you want things to be
worse?

126
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,250
And you might assume that people are
going to automatically answered that.

127
00:08:05,071 --> 00:08:08,310
They'd rather have things better,
but that's not so self evident because

128
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:10,620
to make things better,
it usually requires that you adopt a

129
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:15,390
tremendous amount of responsibility and
that's effortful and difficult and

130
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:19,170
frightening and,
and the buck sort of stops with you,

131
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:21,300
which is also part of what makes it
terrifying.

132
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:27,840
But if you do want things to be better
and you have your mind stream and

133
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,210
oriented in that direction,
then

134
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,150
the truth is your best possible guide
because it'll help you get to that

135
00:08:37,151 --> 00:08:40,810
point.
So I think one of the things that people

136
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:45,811
who talk about morality
failed to understand is that it's not

137
00:08:48,851 --> 00:08:50,260
abstract,
it's practical.

138
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,050
Morality is precisely what's proved to
be most practical,

139
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,820
the longest possible span of time.
Sort of like the,

140
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,140
the moral act is what's best,
all things considered.

141
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:06,000
And part of the reason that it's
necessary for people to follow

142
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:10,950
conventional rules is because convention
is part of the wisdom of mankind.

143
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,140
And the wisdom of mankind has basically
said,

144
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,870
you know,
all things considered,

145
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,160
here's a pathway that you can follow
that is going to work out in principle

146
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,060
best for you.
And so,

147
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,890
you know,
one of the,

148
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,960
one of the considerations there,
speaking in terms of convention is,

149
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:32,430
you know,
the standard path through life,

150
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,300
say in western culture has been to grow
up to form an intimate relationship of

151
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:44,250
some stability to do something
productive than other people approve of.

152
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,083
And,
and,

153
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:50,100
and we'll trade with you for,
to raise children and to establish

154
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:54,240
yourself in a community.
And the reason that that's conventional

155
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:58,740
morality is because that's not such a
bad deal compared to most of the

156
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:01,380
alternatives.
And if you can pull all those things off

157
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:05,340
properly,
then there's a reasonable chance that

158
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,760
you'll at least have a life that isn't
completely full of unbearable suffering

159
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:11,340
with nothing positive in it.
But there's also the,

160
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,640
there's also a reasonable possibility
that you'll have a good life.

161
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,730
And so then you might want to try to do
that correctly.

162
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,500
Why Act Morally?
Why Act in a virtuous manner?

163
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,680
Because it's in your interest and it's
in every once in else,

164
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,250
everyone else's interest as well.
And so that seems like a good deal.

165
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,530
Now it will mean that you'll have to put
off certain forms of impulsive pleasure.

166
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,280
But the problem often with impulsive
pleasure is that well you,

167
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,780
you,
you have pleasure at haste and you

168
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:43,860
repented leisure.

169
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,520
And so part of what standard morality is
trying to do is to inform you about how

170
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:53,430
you might act in the present so that the
present is acceptable.

171
00:10:53,431 --> 00:10:57,300
But so the tomorrow is also good and
next week is also good and next month is

172
00:10:57,301 --> 00:11:02,280
also good and next year is also good for
you and for your family and for your

173
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:06,060
community,
for this broad swath of humanity.

174
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:09,690
And partly what you ask people,
you ask high school students is,

175
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,720
well they want to be part of that or did
they want to do something else?

176
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:15,420
And if they want to do something else,
maybe they want to make things worse

177
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:18,060
while they should think that through,
because that's just not a very good

178
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:19,520
plan,
you know,

179
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,530
unless your goal is to make the world a
more miserable place.

180
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,920
And you know,
often people's goals are precisely.

181
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:29,220
Dot.
Alex fiander asked,

182
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,860
is mindfulness really beneficial or is
it just a trend?

183
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,450
Man,
mostly it's a trend.

184
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,620
Um,
the problem with mindfulness as far as

185
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:38,870
I'm concerned,
is that it's,

186
00:11:38,871 --> 00:11:39,770
it's,
it's a,

187
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,130
it's a word that's like a giant box.
You can put anything you want in it and

188
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:47,790
claim that that's not only what it is,
but that's what it does.

189
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,890
And so I'm,
I'm,

190
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,470
you know,
I would be very hesitant to make a

191
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,690
blanket statement such,
you know,

192
00:11:55,691 --> 00:12:00,691
like no one practicing mindfulness or
teaching mindfulness is producing any

193
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:06,370
benefit for their students.
But yeah,

194
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:08,290
I think mostly it's a,
it's a fat.

195
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,573
So

196
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,610
how can disney produced an architectural
masterpiece in the mid nineties lion

197
00:12:19,611 --> 00:12:24,320
king and then turn around and create
propaganda in the new millennium froze.

198
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,810
That's why Sam Colette,
God,

199
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:29,660
that's a good question.
But there's an even better question that

200
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:32,840
goes along with it.
It's like not only could did isn't he

201
00:12:32,841 --> 00:12:36,320
turned around and create propaganda in
the new millennium because I do believe

202
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,370
exactly that that's what frozen is,
but if I remember correctly,

203
00:12:40,371 --> 00:12:43,640
I think that that's the highest grossing
animated movie now that's ever been

204
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:46,130
made,
so it's not only that they created

205
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,440
propaganda,
it's the people are extraordinarily

206
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:52,130
hungry for it.
Why would that be?

207
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:59,570
Well,
one of the ideological motifs in frozen

208
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,470
is that
you know,

209
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:07,471
the classic idea that
the sleeping beauty needs a prince to

210
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:12,571
awaken her is observed and old fashioned
and that there are alternative ways of

211
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:19,351
traveling through life
that don't require the subjugation that

212
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:25,201
that particular story might appear to
entail.

213
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:31,230
I think that's really naive beyond
belief because a story like sleeping

214
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:36,580
beauty
where the feminine is waiting for the

215
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:37,900
masculine to awaken.

216
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,460
It's true.
It's just as true for men as it is for

217
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:44,990
women.
It's not about men and women.

218
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,670
Precisely.
It is to some degree.

219
00:13:46,671 --> 00:13:50,570
It's more about the masculine and the
feminine and the feminine part of a man,

220
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:56,450
which is the part that enables him to
have a relationship with a woman at all,

221
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,500
is awoken by the archetypal masculine
qualities of clarity of mind.

222
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:07,160
For example,
just as much as the females femininity

223
00:14:07,161 --> 00:14:12,161
is awoken by masculine clarity of mind.
And you can read those old stories and

224
00:14:13,911 --> 00:14:17,630
sleeping beauty in all likelihood.
It's a very little story at multiple

225
00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:18,800
levels simultaneously.

226
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,193
So,

227
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,160
but I,
I think that people want the propaganda

228
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:30,090
because it tells them that what they
already think is correct

229
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,333
and

230
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,690
that all the old wisdom or much of the
old list them,

231
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,250
it can just be dispensed with and people
can conduct your lives in any manner

232
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:40,450
that they want.
Well,

233
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,583
that doesn't work.

234
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,983
So

235
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,370
Julian 10 says,
you have said that to study history is

236
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:53,540
to study oneself and one will be much
more grounded and strong if they do.

237
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:57,140
So will you please more talk on this,
please talk more on this.

238
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,833
Well,
you know,

239
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,440
it's easy for people to think,
let's say you're 30 years old.

240
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,840
It's easy for you to think that you're
actually 30 years old,

241
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,090
but you're not.
You're in many ways,

242
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,630
at least at one level of analysis,
you're three and a half billion years

243
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:21,631
old because that's approximately how
long the genetic structure that has

244
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,850
given rise to you,
at least in part has existed.

245
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,720
And you're the consequences of this
massive,

246
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:34,230
massively extensive evolutionary process
extending back billions of years.

247
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:40,210
It's conditioned every aspect of you.
And so you're a very,

248
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:42,970
very ancient creature from a biological
perspective.

249
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:48,570
And if you don't view yourself across
that entire span of time,

250
00:15:48,941 --> 00:15:52,300
so to speak,
you have the wrong idea about what it

251
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:56,650
means to be a human being.
And then on the cultural end of things,

252
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,460
while you're deeply shaped and

253
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
and inhibited and offered opportunity by
the entire history of human cultural

254
00:16:09,691 --> 00:16:12,900
endeavor,
which is also interacted in the causal

255
00:16:12,901 --> 00:16:16,470
manner with,
with the emergence of our biology across

256
00:16:16,471 --> 00:16:18,390
time.
And if you don't understand history,

257
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:24,300
then you don't understand who you are
because you're a product of history.

258
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,660
Everything you think someone else
already thought,

259
00:16:27,661 --> 00:16:30,450
every word that you use,
someone else came up with.

260
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,570
And so
and now youth person thinks for example,

261
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:38,550
that the thoughts that they have or
their thoughts,

262
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:41,340
but the probability that you're going to
have a thought that's original is

263
00:16:41,341 --> 00:16:45,840
extraordinarily low.
And so just to understand your own

264
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:48,720
thought process,
you need to be deeply,

265
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,910
you understand your own thought process
far more deeply.

266
00:16:53,911 --> 00:16:58,080
If you are an astute student of history,
you also understand the problems that

267
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,820
confront you in the world.
I mean,

268
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,630
you're born into the world in a
particular historical configuration.

269
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,750
That's an architectural truth.
You know,

270
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:12,020
your spirit is born into the world when
the world is a certain specific way.

271
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,050
And that certain specific way is also a
consequence of

272
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,640
vast patterns of processes that have
laid themselves out on a historical

273
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,271
timeframe.
I mean,

274
00:17:24,271 --> 00:17:28,400
just a simple example.
I mean a lot of the um,

275
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:33,630
interpersonal complexities that young
people face say in their,

276
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,530
in their intimate relationships are a
direct consequence of the birth control

277
00:17:37,531 --> 00:17:38,250
pill.
I mean,

278
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,700
that's only been around for 50 years.
So it's not deep history,

279
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:43,680
but it certainly,
it certainly history.

280
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:48,681
And if you don't understand that the
birth control burst in on humanity like

281
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,220
app,
like an atomic

282
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,470
bomb,
maybe like a hydrogen bomb,

283
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,900
you don't understand what it is that's
driving your own interpersonal problems.

284
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,100
So there's no difference between
studying history and studying

285
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:03,030
psychology.
And there's,

286
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,860
there's no difference between studying
history and psychology and,

287
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,960
and trying to understand who you are and
what you should do histories about you.

288
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,950
It's not about the world or it's about
the world and you,

289
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,510
and if you can't see the sense in it,
then you're not approaching it properly.

290
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:22,680
Or You have bad teachers where you don't
know how to read or something like that

291
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:25,410
because history is unbearably
interesting.

292
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,870
And so I suppose that's another marker
that you can use to determine whether or

293
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:33,600
not your attitude towards studying
history is correct.

294
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,690
If you're not fascinated and horrified
by it,

295
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:39,330
almost beyond belief,
then you're not studying history

296
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:41,880
properly.
And I think if you were studying it

297
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:46,020
properly,
you'd never ask why you should study it.

298
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:47,350
It would,
it would be so evident,

299
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:52,351
so obvious that it was necessary.
Why did humans enjoy sad stories?

300
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,800
That's Lx yonder.

301
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,040
Well,
I don't know if they actually enjoyed

302
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:08,500
them,
although I think you could make a case

303
00:19:08,501 --> 00:19:13,360
that they do in sometimes.
Maybe someone's watching a story that's,

304
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,330
that's somewhat sentimental that'll make
them tear up.

305
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,270
And you might say that that's an element
of being sad.

306
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:24,930
But I would say that's more an element
of being compassionate and participating

307
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:30,450
in this fictional way in,
in the love and the intimacy that human

308
00:19:31,361 --> 00:19:34,270
beings are capable of.
So you can do that by proxy and that can

309
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,880
certainly produce sentimental emotions
and,

310
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,200
and nostalgic emotions.
And those can be associated with tiers.

311
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,070
But you could go deeper than that and
saying,

312
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:47,150
well,
people will watch tragic stories.

313
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,000
And that's certainly the case mean any
shakespearian play virtually is,

314
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:54,110
is tragic in many regards.
And I think part of the reason that

315
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:56,720
people are,
are compelled to do that is because

316
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:59,150
we're compelled to understand the
tragedies of our life.

317
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:05,830
And so to see that tragedy laid out on a
stage,

318
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,360
which means that it's distilled and
amplified in some sense,

319
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,400
is to simultaneously engage in the
problem of wrestling with what it means

320
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:20,320
to exist in a tragic world.
And any information you can get about

321
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:23,620
that is going to be well worth the
momentary negative emotion that you

322
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:26,410
might experience while you're engaged in
the play.

323
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,230
So people like sad stories because life
is often sad and we have to figure out

324
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,650
how to deal with that and stories can
tell you how to deal with it well and

325
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,880
how to deal with it badly.
And uh,

326
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,840
that can be absurdly informative.

327
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,540
If Christianity has much historical
wisdom to offer,

328
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:00,780
why is it so derided in the academy?
Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

329
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:06,470
Why Ryan Ross?
Well,

330
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:10,730
I think that people generally think of
Christianity as

331
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,340
science for stupid people.
It's something like that,

332
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,000
you know,
and it's often reduced to its more

333
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:24,860
fundamentalist manifestations.
So you know that the straw man version

334
00:21:24,861 --> 00:21:29,861
of Christianity is
fundamentalist protestantism of the

335
00:21:31,021 --> 00:21:36,021
sword that makes the case that the Bible
is literally true and that the cosmos is

336
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:43,820
roughly several thousand years old.
Well,

337
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:49,521
it's easy to,
it's easy to make fun of that.

338
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,700
I'm not sure it's so why is to make fun
of it can mean people generally have

339
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:57,840
reasons for what they believe and
sometimes it's fear and,

340
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,640
and narrow mindedness and ignorance.
But sometimes what might appear to be

341
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,890
fear,
fear and narrow mindedness and ignorance

342
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:10,850
is actually the attempt to preserve
something of extraordinary,

343
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:15,170
extraordinary value.
The value of which has not been fully

344
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,103
articulated.

345
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:29,020
I guess partly I see the,
so there's the,

346
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:32,530
there's the,
there's the ability for people to

347
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,370
generate the straw man version of
Christianity and then just feel

348
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:41,320
intelligent by comparing their old
knowledge to that.

349
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:44,020
And you know,
that's pretty weak I would say.

350
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,080
I think Marxism contributes to it a lot.
I mean,

351
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:54,310
I think that the universities and our
intellectual life in general is still

352
00:22:54,311 --> 00:22:57,760
saturated with Marxist in new Marxists
presuppositions.

353
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,740
And I really think that's a terrible
thing.

354
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:03,610
I really don't think that that's any
better than having our intellectual

355
00:23:03,611 --> 00:23:06,730
landscape populated by neo fascist
ideas.

356
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,330
I don't see it from a historical
perspective that there's any reason

357
00:23:10,331 --> 00:23:15,331
whatsoever to assume that neo Marxist
ideas are any more morally appropriate

358
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:18,790
than neofascist ideas.
Yeah.

359
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:23,410
And I think a lot of what drives them,
the Neo Marxist analysis of Christianity

360
00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:24,244
is,

361
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,520
some of it's,
some of it's simple mindedness mean the

362
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,900
marxists tend to reduce everything to
power or to economics.

363
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,420
And I mean,
power and economics are important,

364
00:23:37,421 --> 00:23:41,530
but to reduce everything to that is,
is to reduce everything to any one thing

365
00:23:41,531 --> 00:23:44,410
is a mark of a weak mind.
I mean,

366
00:23:44,411 --> 00:23:47,810
most problems multivariant problems,
they're not univariate problems.

367
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,750
I think there's a hatred for the
responsibility that genuine Christianity

368
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:58,970
lays upon a person.
Because after an architectural level,

369
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,470
I mean if you just,
if you,

370
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,660
if you just speak about this
psychologically,

371
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,460
you don't set,
for example,

372
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,790
the soul is naturally Christian.
It's a hell of a thing to say.

373
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,850
But he had his reasons for saying that.
And part of what he was saying was that,

374
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,830
or what do you believe in,
and Aldous Huxley talked about this a

375
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:16,664
bit too,
is that

376
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:24,660
there are elements of Christianity that
have Tiquan conceptualization as far as

377
00:24:24,661 --> 00:24:27,320
it can go.
And that's what makes an architectural

378
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,310
so,
so I can give you an example of that.

379
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:35,060
So there's a presupposition in
Christianity speaking psychologically

380
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,163
that

381
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,560
human beings make progress by making
sacrifices.

382
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,210
That's a good one.
You see this act it out to begin to,

383
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,770
to begin with,
to some degree in the old testament

384
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:53,010
where the sacrifices that people make
are,

385
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,930
are genuine,
archaic sacrifices.

386
00:24:55,931 --> 00:25:00,270
If they take something that they're,
that they believe has value,

387
00:25:00,271 --> 00:25:04,560
perhaps a prize animal and burden at
didn't offer it to God.

388
00:25:04,561 --> 00:25:09,180
And the reason that it's burned as far
as I've been able to tell us,

389
00:25:09,181 --> 00:25:12,240
because the archaic conception of the
world was that the world was a flat

390
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,450
disc.
And on top of that disc was a ball and

391
00:25:15,451 --> 00:25:17,370
the ball was the sky,
roughly speaking.

392
00:25:17,371 --> 00:25:20,460
And then outside the ball,
that's where the gods existed.

393
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:25,470
And I think our cake people believe that
for the same reason that we feel are

394
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:27,930
when we look up in the night sky,
we don't,

395
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,140
you don't want to make the mistake that
just because people didn't know some of

396
00:25:31,141 --> 00:25:33,090
the things we know now that they were
stupid.

397
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,040
They looked up at the night sky or the
day sky and felt awe and,

398
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,240
and,
and part of the intuition that came

399
00:25:39,241 --> 00:25:40,590
along with that,
or was that

400
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:46,160
while they were looking at the night sky
with a day start there looking into the

401
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:49,390
infinite,
and that's a lie very tightly with

402
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,770
divinity.
So there's those ideas going in the

403
00:25:51,771 --> 00:25:52,604
background.
Well,

404
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,220
if you burn something and offer it up to
God,

405
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,700
the smoke rises and God can detect the
quality of your sacrifice and you,

406
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,470
you might think,
well that's again,

407
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:01,304
that's pretty,

408
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,640
yeah,

409
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,710
simple minded,
but it's not,

410
00:26:04,711 --> 00:26:08,250
it's the dramatic representation of an
unbelievably profound idea.

411
00:26:08,251 --> 00:26:12,360
And the profound idea is that sometimes
in order to make things go properly,

412
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:17,630
you have to let go of something that you
deeply love or deeply want to do.

413
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,470
And what it means,
what it means to sacrifice is to let

414
00:26:22,471 --> 00:26:26,970
something go in the present so that the
future can be better or to let something

415
00:26:26,971 --> 00:26:29,790
go personally so that other people can
have it better.

416
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,880
And there's no difference between the
idea of sacrifice and the discovery of

417
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:38,130
the future.
As soon as you discovered the future,

418
00:26:38,131 --> 00:26:41,100
one of the things you realize is that
you have to sacrifice things in the

419
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:46,101
present so that the future manifests
itself in a more acceptable manner.

420
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:47,701
So then you think,
well,

421
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:51,150
that's also an amazing discovery.
Here's the discovery human beings made.

422
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:54,240
If we change our behavior in the
present,

423
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,880
better things could happen in the
future.

424
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,040
Well,
no other animal really has ever

425
00:26:59,041 --> 00:26:59,970
discovered that.
Okay.

426
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:02,730
So that's very tightly linked into the
idea of sacrifice.

427
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,050
And so he might say,
well,

428
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:06,690
you have to sacrifice something of
value.

429
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:12,210
And so sometimes I ask my students,
a lot of them are second or children of

430
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:13,220
immigrants.
You know,

431
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,380
what did your parents sacrifice so that
you can go to university?

432
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:18,660
And I mean,
everyone understands that question.

433
00:27:18,661 --> 00:27:20,940
The students immediately tell me of,
you know,

434
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:24,900
the things that their parents have done.
They moved from some foreign country.

435
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:28,950
They spent 18 hours a day working their
selves to the fingers,

436
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:32,850
to the bone at a laundromat or a dry
cleaner so that their students could

437
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,820
assume that their children could have a
richer and fuller life.

438
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:40,410
They're sacrificing.
And the sacrifices based on it's based

439
00:27:40,411 --> 00:27:44,160
on faith and the faith in,
it's essentially a form of religious

440
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:46,030
faith,
but we don't have to get into that

441
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,990
moment.
But the fundamental driving idea is that

442
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:55,770
the reality is can be positively shaped
by sacrifice.

443
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,210
Well,
that's an amazing idea.

444
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,610
Well,
so then you might say,

445
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:00,444
well,
okay,

446
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,910
the higher quality,
the sacrifice,

447
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,410
the more profound,
the positive effect on the future to

448
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,350
reasonable proposition.
And so then you might say,

449
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,420
what's the most valuable possible
sacrifice and announcer that is long

450
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:20,130
enviously yourself?
So then you can say,

451
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,570
well,
that means that the ultimate moral

452
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:26,130
junction,
the ultimate moral injunction is to

453
00:28:26,131 --> 00:28:29,570
sacrifice yourself in a manner that
makes the future better love.

454
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,880
That's the central idea of Christianity.
The central idea,

455
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:36,480
like the central figure,
mythological figure at the core of

456
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:41,340
Christianity is the person who
voluntarily sacrifices themself to the

457
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:44,790
benevolent will of God.
Well,

458
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,250
if you have any sense,
you're terrified of that idea.

459
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,230
And especially if you're,
if you're,

460
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,490
I would say if you're a rationalistic
intellectual or rationalizing

461
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:54,151
intellectual,
I mean,

462
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:55,940
who?
Who the hell wants to believe that?

463
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:01,330
That that's your moral obligation is to
sacrifice yourself for the best.

464
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:02,821
Well,
God,

465
00:29:02,821 --> 00:29:05,220
you don't know what that means.
I mean the archetypal stories,

466
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:06,720
it means that you end up crucified.

467
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:08,643
Well,

468
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,850
there's lots of reasons to be not very
happy,

469
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,800
both that idea,
but then you say,

470
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:16,980
well,
is the fact that Christian and

471
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,200
Christianity is derided in the academy a
good thing or a bad thing?

472
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,020
Mostly it's a terrible thing.
You know,

473
00:29:23,021 --> 00:29:26,530
it's not like Christianity can't use
some criticism,

474
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,650
although I think,
you know,

475
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,590
nature in many ways,
nature took care of that for us.

476
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,093
But

477
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:40,510
mostly I think what we're doing in the
academy is running as fast as we can

478
00:29:40,511 --> 00:29:45,511
from the responsibility of bearing our
culture and we're diversifying it.

479
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And we were using any number of
appalling rationalizations and

480
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:57,420
ideological maneuvers to try to not only
make that acceptable personally,

481
00:29:57,521 --> 00:30:01,690
but to proselytize about it to others.
You know,

482
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,520
the,
the more,

483
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:08,140
I wouldn't say cynical maybe of what the
more cynical part of me sometimes thinks

484
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:11,050
that the universities now these students
more harm than good,

485
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,590
especially on the humanities because
they take students at a very formative

486
00:30:14,591 --> 00:30:18,760
period of their life when they're all in
their belief systems and their ability

487
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:23,761
to identify strongly with life are
already somebody questioned because they

488
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:28,150
exist in a culture that speak badly
fractured and they take those kids and

489
00:30:28,151 --> 00:30:28,781
they,
you know,

490
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:33,781
they expose them to ideas that are
absolutely destructive and it's not

491
00:30:33,871 --> 00:30:35,860
about having anything against ideas like
that.

492
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,220
Reading Nicha for example is org or
reading dusty Yefsky.

493
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:44,221
I mean that can be a very destructive
act but the purpose of each is writing

494
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,840
and Dostoyevsky's writing.
It's not to destroy,

495
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,090
it's to remove detritus so that
something new can spring forth.

496
00:30:52,091 --> 00:30:54,490
And I'm sorry,
I just don't really see that happening

497
00:30:54,491 --> 00:30:58,360
in the universities.
I think there are too cynical and I

498
00:30:58,361 --> 00:31:03,361
think that there's also a strong streak
of serious anti humanity among moderate

499
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:06,070
intellectuals and that's been the case
for at least a hundred years.

500
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:07,490
You hear people saying,
you know,

501
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,330
like,
I think this was a statement from the

502
00:31:10,331 --> 00:31:12,500
club of Rome,
the people who are so concerned about

503
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:17,230
population explosion back in the mid
1960s that the world would be better off

504
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:21,040
if there were fewer people on it or
maybe that there were no people on it.

505
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,450
Well,
man,

506
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,490
you can't say anything that's more
appalling than that.

507
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,910
You know,
if you said the planet would be better

508
00:31:30,911 --> 00:31:33,460
off if there were fewer black people on
it,

509
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,320
it's like,
well no one's going to put up with that.

510
00:31:35,321 --> 00:31:40,030
Or the planet would be better off if
there were fewer European colonizers on

511
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:40,690
it.
Well,

512
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,400
you might be able to get away with that
a little bit more,

513
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,710
but probably not.
But as long as your

514
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,600
sentiments expand,
extend to humanity as a whole,

515
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:51,860
it's perfectly reasonable for you to say
something like that.

516
00:31:51,861 --> 00:31:54,550
And that's the most horrific thing you
could possibly say.

517
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,030
I mean,
the kids who go into high schools and

518
00:31:58,031 --> 00:32:01,280
shoot them up and call them body kids,
and that's certainly what they believe.

519
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,600
The planet would be a lot better off if
there were fewer people on it.

520
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:07,000
Maybe we'll take a few steps in that
direction.

521
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:13,140
So
Bob Smith says,

522
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,010
nice jacket.
Thank you Paul.

523
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,970
Appreciate that.
All right.

524
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,740
Can you explain each just general
philosophy and some of his most famous

525
00:32:28,741 --> 00:32:31,440
ideas?
He's really hard to comprehend.

526
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,960
Nature's general philosophy.
I probably can't do that.

527
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:42,100
I've been putting together with my
students here,

528
00:32:42,101 --> 00:32:44,990
right?
I've been starting to plan a seminar on

529
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:49,730
existentialism and which would focus a
lot on Nietzsche and Dostoevsky.

530
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,540
I think each just so damn complicated
that you can't really do that.

531
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:56,870
I don't think you can explain niches.
General Philosophy.

532
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,660
First of all,
it wasn't really a systematizer.

533
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:00,830
He,
he,

534
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,933
he,
uh,

535
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:06,200
was skeptical of systematizer.
It's very difficult to distill someone

536
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:09,080
who's not a systematizer into,
you know,

537
00:33:09,081 --> 00:33:12,500
a few general principles.
The thing is with,

538
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:14,900
with,
with some of the greatest thinkers,

539
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,090
you actually have to read what they
wrote.

540
00:33:20,091 --> 00:33:22,550
You have to read the original writings
because the,

541
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:27,670
the brilliance is encapsulated in the
original writings and they can't be

542
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:30,980
condensed.
So,

543
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:32,811
so,
let's see.

544
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:35,990
Can I do any better than that?
Can I explain each his general

545
00:33:35,991 --> 00:33:38,240
philosophy?
Truth serves life.

546
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,270
That's a good one.
And I guess we could unpack that a

547
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:42,104
little bit.
To me,

548
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,540
that's a good example of exactly what I
need you to.

549
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:51,560
So staggeringly brilliant.
One of the things he presumes when he

550
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:55,550
makes a statement like that is that a
human being is in

551
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:01,680
an existential situation that's
characterized by the necessity of

552
00:34:01,681 --> 00:34:06,420
determining what he or she will actually
accept as truth.

553
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,040
You know,
you might say,

554
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:10,890
well,
truth is something you can prove and

555
00:34:10,891 --> 00:34:14,400
that's how you know it's true.
But unfortunately it's not that simple

556
00:34:14,401 --> 00:34:19,401
because you have to decide what criteria
you're going to accept.

557
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,570
There's proof and there's an act of
faith in that.

558
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,690
And there's an enabling were that
argument seems to be lacking.

559
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:33,691
And this is the famous is ot conundrum
that David Hume described is,

560
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,000
okay,
well let's say that you use science to

561
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:41,560
lay out a very detailed description of
the nature of the objective world.

562
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,650
Well,
that still doesn't mean that you know

563
00:34:44,651 --> 00:34:48,130
how to act in that world.
And that's a big problem.

564
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:53,160
It might be a fundamental problem if the
fundamental problem of people isn't what

565
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,630
is the nature of the objective world
thought?

566
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,280
How is it that you should conduct
yourself while you're alive?

567
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,990
Well,
neat you to believe that

568
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,030
the fundamental question was how you
should conduct yourself while you're

569
00:35:07,031 --> 00:35:08,290
alive.
How should you act?

570
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:11,920
And then I would say that's the
fundamental question of meaning and

571
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,260
science can inform you,
but it can't really solve that problem

572
00:35:17,261 --> 00:35:19,030
for you.
And that's a problem.

573
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:23,380
And then science also has this other
terrible attribute.

574
00:35:23,381 --> 00:35:25,480
Some sense,
which is that

575
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:32,480
because science can't solve the problem
of how you should act in the world,

576
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:35,640
it

577
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,200
impels people towards conclusion that
there is no answer to the question,

578
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:45,201
how should you act in the world?
And so that way that opens up a door to

579
00:35:46,251 --> 00:35:47,740
nihilism and I was,
is,

580
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,970
is,
is it's destructive.

581
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,610
It,
it does not facilitate life.

582
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:55,470
In fact,
it has the opposite effect.

583
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,550
It takes the spirit of the people,
it takes the motivation out of people,

584
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:02,100
it makes them bitter,
it makes them resentful,

585
00:36:02,101 --> 00:36:04,950
it makes them hateful.
It's not a good thing.

586
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,570
Also niches,
primarily concerned in some sense with

587
00:36:09,571 --> 00:36:13,890
how to act,
and part of the reason that he

588
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:18,120
decomposes Christianity to the degree
that he does this because he believed

589
00:36:18,121 --> 00:36:21,390
that Christianity
was a very,

590
00:36:21,391 --> 00:36:23,700
very serious attempt to answer the
question,

591
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:27,420
how should you act?
And he also believed that it had become

592
00:36:27,421 --> 00:36:32,421
fatally flawed for a variety of reasons,
at least in its typical societally

593
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,840
socially instantiated forms.

594
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,750
So he took it upon himself to subject it
to a criticism.

595
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,040
But I've always thought I've Nicha.
It's a terrible image,

596
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,980
but I've always thought Nietzsche has
like a magnet in a wound.

597
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:52,320
It's like what he's doing is clearing
away dead and diseased tissues so that

598
00:36:52,321 --> 00:36:56,400
something else can live and it's a
terrible thing to watch.

599
00:36:56,401 --> 00:36:58,780
It's a terrible thing to apprehend and
it's,

600
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,630
it's a terribly destructive thing to
involve yourself in these niches.

601
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,120
He said he philosophize with the hammer
and that's certainly true,

602
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,650
but he was trying to clear the path for
something new and that that's something

603
00:37:10,651 --> 00:37:13,170
new.
He was trying to formulate with his

604
00:37:13,171 --> 00:37:15,570
consumption such as like this,
the,

605
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:20,571
the superman that the next version of
human beings so to speak.

606
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:24,690
And he thought of them as people who
would create their own values

607
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:30,220
and if that would be the way forward,
oh,

608
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,720
is the wreckage of Christianity,
let's say.

609
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,180
Oh,
I think Nisha was wrong about that.

610
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,850
And I say that with all due respect,
believe me,

611
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,080
and I say a cautiously and I don't think
it's an original idea of my own,

612
00:37:42,081 --> 00:37:44,780
that nature was wrong.
And I think the reason that he was

613
00:37:44,781 --> 00:37:47,360
wrong,
just because people don't create value,

614
00:37:47,361 --> 00:37:50,450
say discover them or maybe they cocreate
them,

615
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,960
but you can't create values
by conjuring them out of nonexistence.

616
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,660
You could say if you were scientifically
minded,

617
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,900
that values are in some sense,
arbitrary.

618
00:38:05,901 --> 00:38:08,120
And then if you believe that values are
arbitrary,

619
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:10,520
you might then believe that people could
create them.

620
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,670
Oh,
there's nothing but values aren't

621
00:38:13,671 --> 00:38:16,910
arbitrary.
And most of the time people discover

622
00:38:16,911 --> 00:38:20,000
them
and maybe they cocreate the,

623
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:25,330
and one of the reasons that I so have
been so attracted to use thinking is

624
00:38:25,341 --> 00:38:27,350
because young is in many ways a
Nietzschean,

625
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,920
a student of nature,
also a student of Freud,

626
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:35,940
but more primarily a student of nature
and s lifelong endeavor

627
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:41,610
was to understand what the way forward
might be given the situation that needs

628
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:47,740
you to describe and the situation that
needs you to described in some sense was

629
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:52,741
that Christianity laid so much emphasis
on truth that it ended up undermining

630
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:58,171
its own axiomatic presuppositions.
And so then you thought following it

631
00:38:59,231 --> 00:39:01,120
needs you well,
okay,

632
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:04,180
in principle we have to create new
values.

633
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:07,540
But that that's partly why you even got
so interested in the unconscious because

634
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:11,440
one of the things he found particular in
his analysis of the collective

635
00:39:11,441 --> 00:39:16,360
unconscious that was that the values
that Nietzsche thought people should

636
00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:20,830
create were actually lying dormant in
well in our imagination.

637
00:39:20,831 --> 00:39:23,290
That's one way of thinking about it
because that's a good way of thinking

638
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:28,291
about the collective unconscious and
that it was a return to the deepest that

639
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:32,530
the way forward in terms of the
generation of new value was,

640
00:39:32,531 --> 00:39:37,531
was a return to the deepest recesses of
human existence and a rediscovery of

641
00:39:38,591 --> 00:39:41,230
what was actually there.
I touched on that a little bit today

642
00:39:41,231 --> 00:39:43,720
when I was talking about the necessity
for sacrifice,

643
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,540
like there's an archetypal idea that the
savior,

644
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:51,410
the Messiah is,
is by definition the person who was

645
00:39:51,411 --> 00:39:55,610
willing to sacrifice him or herself for
the ultimate good,

646
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,150
whatever that happens to be and if
that's the appropriate pathway forward.

647
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,310
Well that's,
that's an art degree teak of

648
00:40:02,311 --> 00:40:05,460
Christianity and I,
and I think that you almost right.

649
00:40:05,461 --> 00:40:09,540
I think he's correct.
That's a terrible thing to say because I

650
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:12,160
mean yoga is such a radical thinker that
it's,

651
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,013
it's,

652
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,940
it's funny because yoga is subject to a
lot of criticism.

653
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:20,130
I mean,
I read Richard [inaudible] book on

654
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:22,140
Nisha,
I think it was called the area in Christ

655
00:40:22,141 --> 00:40:26,310
and nowell basically who I think was a
very is or was,

656
00:40:26,311 --> 00:40:28,680
I'm very resentful person.
Um,

657
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,500
I think he did a hatchet job on you.
He,

658
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:34,350
he the cover of his book made Yo look
like it was a Nazi.

659
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:38,160
I mean how cheap cheap shot that is.
But you know,

660
00:40:38,161 --> 00:40:43,161
he accused yoga basically fomenting a
cult and I read no book and it just made

661
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:49,011
me laugh because what you was actually
up to is so much worse so to speak.

662
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,720
Then merely starting a cult.
It's like accusing and ax murder of,

663
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,040
of,
of uh,

664
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,633
of what

665
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:02,640
annoying,
annoying his pet cat.

666
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,980
You know,
it's that the differences that

667
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,710
extensive,
the sorts of things that Ewan was

668
00:41:07,711 --> 00:41:12,711
actually messing around with are so
complicated and terrible compared to

669
00:41:12,901 --> 00:41:15,120
just building a little cult that,
you know,

670
00:41:15,121 --> 00:41:18,120
it's absolutely clear that Noah had no
idea what he was talking about.

671
00:41:18,121 --> 00:41:22,170
He only said it like nature.
Like Dostoevsky is that terrifying

672
00:41:22,171 --> 00:41:24,410
person.
And I think part of the reason that you

673
00:41:24,411 --> 00:41:27,870
don't use not well regarded in the
academy and also my Christianity is

674
00:41:27,871 --> 00:41:32,871
subject to such continual rationalist
and criticism is because people open up

675
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:39,170
and take one look at what he's doing and
either just don't get it at all or they

676
00:41:39,171 --> 00:41:40,970
get a little bit of it.
It scares them so badly.

677
00:41:40,971 --> 00:41:43,860
They think there's no damn way I'm going
there and,

678
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:46,280
and I can really understand that.
I think,

679
00:41:46,281 --> 00:41:49,940
I think anybody with any sense would be
very,

680
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:53,610
very careful about trying to figure out
what Dean was talking about.

681
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:58,611
It
is cognitive behavioral,

682
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:04,923
a sorry here

683
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,410
I missed that.
Sorry about that.

684
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,900
It's a good idea to believe in
something.

685
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:17,810
Healthy delusions like Karma or life
after death.

686
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:22,010
That's Danny Wall socket.
Well there is a whole line of social

687
00:42:22,011 --> 00:42:24,680
psychology that was very popular about
15 years ago.

688
00:42:24,681 --> 00:42:27,170
In fact,
the most cited social psychological

689
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:30,620
paper ever written was about the
necessity of positive illusions.

690
00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:33,500
You know,
the basic hypothesis was life was so

691
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,310
tragic and dismal that unless you
bolstered yourself against it with,

692
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:41,630
you know,
defensible optimists and I suppose if

693
00:42:41,631 --> 00:42:45,860
you were being charitable or just
positive illusions lies is what I think

694
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:48,770
are that life would actually be a
tolerable.

695
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:53,570
And I think that's unbelievably
nihilistic and vicious philosophy.

696
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:58,550
I think the fact that that was actually
seriously put forward by,

697
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:04,750
by a generation of social psychologists
as a medication for the modern disease

698
00:43:05,301 --> 00:43:08,540
of meaning,
it is an absolute indictment of the

699
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:10,430
entire field.
Um,

700
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,040
no,
there's nothing about illusions that are

701
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:16,130
healthy,
but that doesn't mean that cynicism and

702
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:20,450
despair are forms of truth or that
nihilism is a form of truth.

703
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:24,590
There's no such thing as healthy
delusions.

704
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:28,863
No.
You know,

705
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,970
any wall song consent,
it's like Karma.

706
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,900
Well,
I didn't know Karma is a healthy

707
00:43:34,901 --> 00:43:36,850
delusion and I'm not so sure about,
I

708
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:42,160
mean there's some elements of Karma that
I think are extremely interesting from a

709
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:45,460
psychological perspective and we can
scrap the incarnation element of it

710
00:43:45,461 --> 00:43:49,150
because I,
well for obviously at least for the sake

711
00:43:49,151 --> 00:43:51,310
of simplicity,
but I believe in Karma.

712
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,850
I think that no one gets away with
anything ever.

713
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:59,910
I think every single thing you do that
is the moral cause in the moral thing is

714
00:44:00,731 --> 00:44:02,740
an attempt to work the structure of
reality.

715
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:06,460
Everything you do that's immoral,
comes back to haunt you.

716
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,060
And it generally comes back in multiply
form.

717
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:12,730
Now that doesn't mean you'll be able to
drive the costs of connections.

718
00:44:12,731 --> 00:44:16,840
Like you might've done something immoral
who knows five years ago and that

719
00:44:16,841 --> 00:44:21,430
produced like a crack in the structure
of your being and like it's five years

720
00:44:21,431 --> 00:44:23,800
later and all sorts of things are
falling into that crack.

721
00:44:23,801 --> 00:44:28,510
And you have no idea that that initial
act was what produced this know

722
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:32,640
cascading consequences events.
But that doesn't mean it didn't.

723
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:34,853
So

724
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:39,480
what did [inaudible] mean by revolt in
the myth of Sisyphus?

725
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:43,710
What are some ways to revolt without
being destructive or should one simply

726
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:45,490
be a good app?
Thank you.

727
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:49,620
Well that's 19 k Mitch.
Well the first thing I should say,

728
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:52,290
how bad is it not those so simple to be
a good aunt.

729
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,490
Like I think being a good aunt is better
than just being a chaotic.

730
00:44:56,491 --> 00:44:58,000
And,
and useless aunt.

731
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:02,040
And so you should probably go from
chaotic and useless and two good.

732
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:06,210
And that's a process of maturation.
That's what happens when you're,

733
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,040
you know,
you move from being a child to an

734
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,450
adolescent,
to a young adult.

735
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,960
You adopt the strictures and
responsibilities of your culture to

736
00:45:15,571 --> 00:45:17,730
discipline yourself.
Now,

737
00:45:17,731 --> 00:45:20,880
if you stop at the point where you're a
good aunt,

738
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,020
while then I think,
you know,

739
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:25,290
that's not so good then,
then you're,

740
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:30,530
you're an Avatar of the pathologies of
your culture as well as an Avatar of the

741
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:32,250
virtues of your culture.

742
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,260
So,
but you,

743
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:37,150
you,
it's fighting against mirror

744
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,920
enculturation is,
that's,

745
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:41,160
that's not virtue,
that's failure.

746
00:45:41,161 --> 00:45:43,620
That's just failure to mature.
You know,

747
00:45:43,621 --> 00:45:46,410
that was actually one of Nietzsche's
questions of conscience.

748
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:50,820
Um,
are you leading or are you just running

749
00:45:50,821 --> 00:45:52,290
away?
Well,

750
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,720
the answer that almost always is he
running away.

751
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:57,270
You might think you're leading,
but the probability that you're leaving,

752
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:00,420
especially if you haven't seriously
considered the possibility that you're

753
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:02,160
running away,
it's like really?

754
00:46:02,161 --> 00:46:04,290
What's the,
what's the chances if you,

755
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:06,960
if you really think about us,
not that easy lead and it's pretty easy

756
00:46:06,961 --> 00:46:09,510
to run away.
So if you're not doing what other people

757
00:46:09,511 --> 00:46:12,000
are doing,
you're probably running away.

758
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,800
And you might say,
well that's pretty rough.

759
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:15,090
It's like fair enough.
You know,

760
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,320
if you've got some absolute,
the unique destiny that you have to

761
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:20,850
manifest more power to you.

762
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:26,370
Um,
but

763
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:31,070
most of the time what I see are people
who think they have a unique destiny and

764
00:46:31,071 --> 00:46:34,610
really what they're doing is wandering
off the beat batch into some thorn

765
00:46:34,611 --> 00:46:37,160
written ditch where things are not going
to be good for them.

766
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,013
So

767
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,500
what are some ways to revolt without
being distracted?

768
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,970
Revolt against what?
That'd be the question.

769
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:50,123
I mean,
it's a very,

770
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:53,130
you could try revolting against your
lack of discipline.

771
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,410
Like that's good.
That's a war.

772
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:56,900
That's a war.
If you want a war,

773
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:59,520
maybe you do because people need war.
You know,

774
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:04,500
I think it was William James who said
that people need a moral equivalent to

775
00:47:04,501 --> 00:47:06,210
war.
I think that's what [inaudible] was

776
00:47:06,211 --> 00:47:07,530
trying to discover,
by the way,

777
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,490
the moral equivalent to war,
and I think he did discover it as well.

778
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:14,490
And that's tied up with the idea of
sacrifice.

779
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:19,090
If you want to revoke,
you should revolt against your own

780
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:24,690
pathology and inadequacy and uselessness
and resentment and cruelty and blindness

781
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:28,930
and yeah,
you could have a war against,

782
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:32,470
you could revolt against that.
That gives you something to do.

783
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,820
Pete,
Professor Mra,

784
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:39,880
people are often quite smart.
Why did they have this strong tendency

785
00:47:39,881 --> 00:47:41,320
towards atheism?
Oh,

786
00:47:41,321 --> 00:47:42,430
well,
you know people who are,

787
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:44,910
have smart,
good atheistic right away because you

788
00:47:44,911 --> 00:47:46,960
know,
it's obvious who really believe in God.

789
00:47:46,961 --> 00:47:49,730
You believe in an old man and this guy,
you already think the world's least

790
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,430
7,000 years old.
It's like,

791
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:54,160
do you really believe Christ turned wine
into water?

792
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:57,280
You know,
no one who wasn't foolish would believe

793
00:47:57,281 --> 00:47:59,050
that.
While that's the statement of someone

794
00:47:59,051 --> 00:47:59,884
who's,

795
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,760
I guess who's smart enough to start to
notice something about what people

796
00:48:07,761 --> 00:48:09,350
believe,
but you know,

797
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,680
they're 10 steps along out 50,000 mile
journey.

798
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,980
So,
and then the other thing,

799
00:48:15,981 --> 00:48:20,930
I already mentioned this about atheism,
people like to think that the reason

800
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:23,810
their atheistic is because they're clear
headed and rational.

801
00:48:23,811 --> 00:48:24,890
It's like,
well first of all,

802
00:48:24,891 --> 00:48:26,090
know,
probably they're not.

803
00:48:26,091 --> 00:48:28,850
Because how often do you meet someone
who's clear headed and rational?

804
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:33,440
Like being psychoanalytically minded?
I'm always way more likely to look for

805
00:48:33,441 --> 00:48:36,680
the dark reason that someone is doing
something rather than the light reason.

806
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:38,450
You know,
the reason that's moving them towards

807
00:48:38,451 --> 00:48:40,610
the light because it's hard to move
towards the light.

808
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,820
And so I would say most of the time
people are atheistic.

809
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:45,860
Well,
it's kind of,

810
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:51,170
it's fashionable in some silicon said
fashion way to Vr to revolt if you're

811
00:48:51,171 --> 00:48:54,020
rational and if you're kind of an
intellectual.

812
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:57,050
Um,
but also you can just dispense with

813
00:48:57,051 --> 00:49:00,560
responsibility if you're atheistic.
And I think that's 90% of the reason

814
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,840
that it's,
especially in the modern world,

815
00:49:02,841 --> 00:49:06,590
that's why people are proponents of
atheism.

816
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,840
You know,
or they have some particular hatred for

817
00:49:08,841 --> 00:49:11,390
the church.
I think Richard Dawkins has a particular

818
00:49:11,391 --> 00:49:13,070
hatred for the church.
I would,

819
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,090
I would,
I would,

820
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:18,230
I've thought about this many times.
I would swear that something happened to

821
00:49:18,231 --> 00:49:22,130
him when he was a kid that wasn't good
and that the church was involved because

822
00:49:22,131 --> 00:49:24,380
he has such an animus against the
church.

823
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:27,090
It's that,
that it,

824
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:28,640
it,
it possesses him.

825
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:32,950
There's a reason for that.
All right,

826
00:49:32,951 --> 00:49:34,030
so let's see here.

827
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:40,580
That's,
can you explain why the conventional

828
00:49:40,581 --> 00:49:43,630
wisdom about each and people are so at
odds with your ideas about each of

829
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:44,450
people.
But yeah,

830
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:45,261
that's Harold.
Boom.

831
00:49:45,261 --> 00:49:48,620
I can explain that.
People like to think they're smart and

832
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:50,720
they like,
and the easiest way to think you're

833
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:53,150
smart in many ways is to think that
other people aren't.

834
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,860
And so we think,
well,

835
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:57,860
the people who came before us all these
thousands of centuries,

836
00:49:58,190 --> 00:49:59,840
you know,
they just didn't know what we knew.

837
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:03,440
Well,
there are cultures didn't have the same

838
00:50:03,441 --> 00:50:07,400
degree of staggering technological
capacity that our skin,

839
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,230
but that didn't mean that they were
stupid.

840
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:12,620
I mean you throw the average person back
into ancient Athens,

841
00:50:12,621 --> 00:50:17,621
they're not gonna last very long.
It's lack of respect.

842
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,960
And you know,
that is a definite hallmark of water

843
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,930
culture is that you can hardly even
tell.

844
00:50:23,931 --> 00:50:25,160
You know,
you can hardly even say,

845
00:50:25,161 --> 00:50:27,950
well being respectful.
It sounds like you're from 19

846
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,870
be respectful.
Well

847
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:36,220
if you're not,
if you don't want to be nihilistic,

848
00:50:36,221 --> 00:50:37,900
you better be respectful because

849
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,233
yeah,

850
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,540
being nihilistic and having respect for
nothing are exactly the same thing.

851
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:50,240
So you could start by having some
respect for your ancestors and try and

852
00:50:50,241 --> 00:50:52,040
figure out what the hell they were
talking about.

853
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,950
He read the Old Testament for example.
It's a very weird book.

854
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:56,000
It's a very,
very,

855
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:57,410
very,
very weird book.

856
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:00,560
Lots of people wrote it,
lots of people and it did.

857
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:04,960
It got sequenced together and turned
into this volume for,

858
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:07,220
for reasons that we just can't
understand.

859
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:11,720
It's our collective work of the human
imagination and people read it.

860
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:14,240
So simple.
It's such a simple minded way.

861
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,420
They read it like fundamentalist,
like simple minded.

862
00:51:17,421 --> 00:51:20,570
Fundamentalist Protestants.
Think about science.

863
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,600
No,
the fundamentalist Protestants think the

864
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:26,630
Bible is literally true.
Science is literally true.

865
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,660
Doris,
the Bible is science.

866
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:31,700
Well,
you know,

867
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:34,820
no,
the people who wrote the Bible word

868
00:51:34,821 --> 00:51:36,470
scientist,
that's just not how it works.

869
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:37,400
But then the,
the,

870
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,850
the,
like the modern critics of religious

871
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:42,470
thinking of traditional religious
thinking,

872
00:51:42,471 --> 00:51:43,610
they're just,
they're the same.

873
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,040
They do the same thing except backwards.
They say,

874
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:46,371
no,
no,

875
00:51:46,371 --> 00:51:47,930
no,
religion was science.

876
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:50,240
It's just bad sides.
And so,

877
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:51,920
you know,
we don't have pay any attention to it.

878
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,050
Well,
it's not science,

879
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:57,050
it's something else.
It's ethics,

880
00:51:57,051 --> 00:51:58,730
it's morality,
it's drama,

881
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:04,090
it's all of that and dramas about how to
live and religious drama is,

882
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:09,440
it's a definitional issue.
There's nothing deeper than religious

883
00:52:09,441 --> 00:52:13,040
drama.
And the reason for that is that depth

884
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:17,690
defines what's religious.
And like I know this firsthand hardly

885
00:52:17,691 --> 00:52:21,230
because in my clinical practice,
like I often see people who are in

886
00:52:21,231 --> 00:52:22,250
terrible,
terrible,

887
00:52:22,251 --> 00:52:26,840
terrible trouble and often that trouble
is ethical and if the trouble they're in

888
00:52:26,841 --> 00:52:28,910
is bad enough,
there's no other language to

889
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:32,600
conceptualize it in.
Isn't religious because the religious

890
00:52:32,601 --> 00:52:35,810
language comes into its own.
When you're dealing with problems.

891
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:39,860
Normally we have life and death,
but literally of Heaven and Hell and you

892
00:52:39,861 --> 00:52:41,060
know,
modern people think,

893
00:52:41,061 --> 00:52:43,880
well there's no such thing as heaven and
there's no such thing as hell.

894
00:52:43,881 --> 00:52:45,050
It's like,
okay fine,

895
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:48,110
there's no such thing as heaven,
let's accept that.

896
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:50,450
But if you think there's no such thing
as hell,

897
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:55,590
like
I can't see how someone who's educated

898
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,800
would ever dare to make that claim.

899
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:04,043
Like

900
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:07,230
after everything that happened to us in
the 20th century,

901
00:53:07,231 --> 00:53:11,280
I can't see that someone could ever say
that there's no such thing as hell

902
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:15,060
without being terrified that a bolt of
lightning would obliterate them on the

903
00:53:15,061 --> 00:53:15,894
spot.

904
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:18,930
No.
Hell is real.

905
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:22,290
And if you want to talk about use
religious language and if you want to

906
00:53:22,291 --> 00:53:26,640
figure out how to get away from hell,
you use religious language.

907
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:29,130
And that's what religious language is
for.

908
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:32,310
So you know the,
the,

909
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,530
that's actually understandable.
Now I would say if,

910
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:38,010
if it,
if you want to learn about this,

911
00:53:38,011 --> 00:53:39,870
you can,
you can read nature,

912
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,570
you can read Dostoyevsky you can read
young.

913
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:45,960
It's hard.
You can read young student,

914
00:53:45,961 --> 00:53:48,090
Eric Normand,
Eric Norman was a genius.

915
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:51,470
Like I wanted this information is there
waiting for people to,

916
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,870
to begin to understand it.
But it's hard slog again.

917
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,550
And part of the problem is is that you
get to hell way before you get to have,

918
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:05,320
you know,
and one of the things youngest sometimes

919
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:09,760
conceptualized as a new age thinker,
I think that's absurd.

920
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:10,860
I think it's,
it's,

921
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,670
it's,
it's the platelet observe,

922
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,400
one of his fundamental propositions is
that if you follow a meaningful and

923
00:54:20,401 --> 00:54:24,930
truthful path that will take you to the
worst place you can imagine.

924
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:29,880
And then possibly having gone there,
the journey uphill,

925
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:32,580
you know,
towards the light can begin in earnest.

926
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,093
Well,

927
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,080
who wants that?
Well,

928
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:44,520
no one,
if they have any sense,

929
00:54:44,521 --> 00:54:47,160
but you know,
young also made another statement which,

930
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,830
which really taught me to the bone when
I first understood it,

931
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:50,664
he said,
yeah,

932
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,810
anything you don't thoroughly
understand,

933
00:54:54,811 --> 00:54:56,910
you act out in the world as fate.

934
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:02,950
And so one of the,
one of the lessons I took away from that

935
00:55:02,951 --> 00:55:03,590
is then,
you know,

936
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:06,100
if you don't want hell to manifest
itself in the world,

937
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:09,220
then you better understand your role in
producing it.

938
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:13,330
And I would say that's actually the
primary religious injunction.

939
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:18,880
And I would also say that that's a big
part of the reason why belief systems

940
00:55:18,881 --> 00:55:21,580
such as Christianity.
I'm talking mostly about Christianity

941
00:55:21,581 --> 00:55:23,290
because that's what I'm most familiar
with.

942
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,030
But,
and also because it's,

943
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:29,860
it's definitely out the fin on the
foundation of Western civilization

944
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,140
actually quite a fan of Western
civilization.

945
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,850
I mean,
the fundamental moral injunction is in

946
00:55:36,851 --> 00:55:40,590
Christianity or one of them.
I mean they're all tangled together,

947
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:45,160
I guess to some degree it's like you
want to constrain hell within yourself.

948
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,490
Well,
that's no joke man.

949
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:50,003
I mean,

950
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:52,230
you know,
one of what,

951
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:55,890
another thing I learned from Yoga and
from Nietzsche was that if you,

952
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,810
if you,
if you look at the sorts of things that

953
00:55:57,811 --> 00:55:59,320
happen,
saying now she Germany or,

954
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,130
or,
or in the Soviet Union or in Mao's China

955
00:56:02,131 --> 00:56:06,390
or that are still happening around the
world where they're systematic torture

956
00:56:06,391 --> 00:56:08,820
and persecution of millions and millions
of people,

957
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:11,970
where,
where the entire state was devoted

958
00:56:11,971 --> 00:56:16,020
towards making things as bad as they can
possibly be and then making them even

959
00:56:16,021 --> 00:56:20,820
worse after that is that people played a
role in that and they were people like

960
00:56:20,821 --> 00:56:23,380
you.
And that means that people like you play

961
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:27,400
a role in that.
And so then the question is what's your

962
00:56:27,401 --> 00:56:29,830
role and is that the game that you want
to be playing?

963
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,850
Well,
that's a serious question because it is

964
00:56:33,851 --> 00:56:36,460
people like you who were responsible for
that.

965
00:56:36,461 --> 00:56:41,461
And it means that to the degree that
you're a person and you don't want that

966
00:56:42,551 --> 00:56:45,850
to happen anymore,
you have to sort that out within

967
00:56:45,851 --> 00:56:46,980
yourself.
So I can,

968
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:50,740
I can explain it.
I think I'll close with this another

969
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,270
deeply religious idea.
There's another idea.

970
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,800
This is an archetypal idea about the
image of the savior,

971
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:03,820
the Messiah.
The Messiah is the person who takes the

972
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:09,541
sins of the world onto himself.
That's a classic archetypal idea.

973
00:57:10,231 --> 00:57:11,680
It's like what does that mean?

974
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:20,670
It means that you look for the
motivations that drove Hitler in

975
00:57:20,671 --> 00:57:25,671
yourself because they were there
and that's what it means to take the

976
00:57:26,011 --> 00:57:31,011
sins of the world onto yourself.
It means that you have to view yourself

977
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:36,350
as the perpetrator of archetypical evil.
You know,

978
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,590
one of the things you said for example,
what's that?

979
00:57:39,591 --> 00:57:41,910
If you,
if you take a small moral failing that a

980
00:57:41,911 --> 00:57:46,170
person manifests and you dig into that

981
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:51,460
as deeply as you can,
you end up in the center of health,

982
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:55,720
like the roots of that unethical
behavior go all the way down to the,

983
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,520
to the,
to the archetype and in my experience,

984
00:57:59,521 --> 00:58:00,600
docs being true.
That's,

985
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,530
that's right.
That's why people want to have

986
00:58:02,531 --> 00:58:06,290
conversations about this sort of thing.
Can you see it happening in,

987
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,380
in,
in intimate relationships all the time

988
00:58:08,381 --> 00:58:11,140
where there are things that the two
people who were involved in the

989
00:58:11,141 --> 00:58:15,220
relationship,
we'll just not talk about why it's cause

990
00:58:15,221 --> 00:58:18,430
they don't want to go there.
And where is it that they don't want to

991
00:58:18,431 --> 00:58:20,500
go?
They don't want to get to the bottom of

992
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:21,820
things.
Well,

993
00:58:21,821 --> 00:58:26,650
no wonder because you know,
that's an archetypal idea to hell is a

994
00:58:26,651 --> 00:58:29,020
pit.
It's at the bottom of things.

995
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:29,741
It's like,
yeah,

996
00:58:29,741 --> 00:58:31,900
that is where it is and you have to go
there.

997
00:58:31,901 --> 00:58:35,740
If you want a straight things out,
it's like who the hell wants to do that?

998
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:37,960
Well,
the alternative is that it plays itself

999
00:58:37,961 --> 00:58:42,961
out in the world and we've seen that and
that doesn't look like a good idea to

1000
00:58:43,151 --> 00:58:43,984
me.

1001
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:51,110
Well,
I guess we should probably end there

1002
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:53,040
because I'm getting fuzzy minded then
stuff.

1003
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:57,250
That's always a good time to stop.
So thank you very much for tuning in and

1004
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:02,030
if this seems to have been successful,
kind of had a slow start as far as I was

1005
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,150
concerned.
I was kind of muddled headed to begin

1006
00:59:04,151 --> 00:59:05,290
with.
But,

1007
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,210
uh,
you know,

1008
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:11,650
maybe we'll edit all that out anyways,
I'm thinking about doing this on a

1009
00:59:11,651 --> 00:59:12,790
regular basis,
so,

1010
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,340
you know,
let me know what you think and,

1011
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:15,130
and,
uh,

1012
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:17,320
we'll see how many people watch it and
we'll see what happens.

1013
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:20,820
And thanks to all my Iras because I've
learned some research assistants here

1014
00:59:20,821 --> 00:59:23,330
who already helping me out with this.
So a,

1015
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:26,240
mastering the technology and figuring
out what to do with youtube.

1016
00:59:26,241 --> 00:59:29,060
So thank you very much for tuning in
and,

1017
00:59:29,061 --> 00:59:30,710
uh,
hopefully I'll see you again.

1018
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:32,120
Ciao.
