00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,210
Hello there,
Mr Ruben [inaudible].

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:03,253
All right,
Jp January one we got anything good for 

3
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:07,034
the people?

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,240
Well,
I don't know how good it is.

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,480
Um,
I guess we're going to find out how good

6
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:15,030
it is.
It's not something I'm thrilled about by

7
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:15,864
any stretch of the imagination.
So you and I have been talking for a 

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,333
couple of weeks now.
Never since this scandal around Carl 

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,080
Benjamin or Sargon of the cod broken.
We decided,

10
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,550
well a while back that we were going to 
while do a variety of things,

11
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:33,384
right?
We were going to announce our departure 

12
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:38,820
from Patrion,
which is what we're doing in this video.

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,300
I'm going to leave Patriot on January 
15th

14
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,860
I also am going to leave Patriot on 
January 15th which by the way,

15
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:48,694
we should just be clear.
This is not something that we wanted to 

16
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:52,474
do.
We were both perfectly happy on 

17
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:55,840
patriotic patriotic,
at least for me,

18
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:59,340
it's been the backbone of my show.
I mean that's,

19
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:03,490
it's somewhere between 60 and 70% of our
funding is through patriots.

20
00:01:03,491 --> 00:01:05,290
So this is not something we wanted to 
do.

21
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:08,580
I know we're going to talk about a whole
bunch of things in this reporting.

22
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:09,643
Uh,
but that New York Times article that 

23
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:12,550
came out,
the implication was,

24
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:13,960
oh,
we're doing this for money.

25
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:14,794
It's like we're taking a major hit right
now and opening ourselves up to all 

26
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:19,024
sorts of risks.
So I'm going ahead and doing that 

27
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:23,460
because I believe we can do something 
better.

28
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:24,294
We've got to figure out exactly what 
that is and that's what we're working 

29
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:26,990
on.

30
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,670
So we can say two things.
I mean,

31
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:29,943
I,
I'd also like to thank the Patriot on 

32
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:32,294
people for what they did in the past 
because they provided me with a 

33
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:37,670
tremendous amount of,
or the ability,

34
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,720
the opportunity to generate a tremendous
amount of financial support at a time.

35
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:42,554
I really needed it.
And so I'm not happy in the least with 

36
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:45,704
what has happened.
I have thought about it a lot and 

37
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,313
believe that given patrons proclivity to
sensor and the reasons that they're 

38
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,654
doing it,
especially as I've looked more and more 

39
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:57,020
deeply into the reasons,
um,

40
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,603
particularly with regards to my 
discovery of the website changed the 

41
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:03,284
terms,
I've become increasingly convinced that 

42
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,570
it's unethical to continue my 
association with the company.

43
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,583
And I also agree,
Jack Conte said in that New York Times 

44
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:15,224
article trying to justify,
say Sam Harris his departure and are 

45
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:18,794
threatened departure that it was 
motivated primarily by financial gain 

46
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:23,900
and like,
look,

47
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:26,570
I've got nothing against financial gain.
You know,

48
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:31,070
I've said that from the beginning.
And if if things that I'm doing generate

49
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:36,170
an honest amount of money that I can put
two reasonable use,

50
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:38,570
then so much the better.
But

51
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,473
this is a major financial blow.
I'm using the Patriot on money for a 

52
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:44,804
variety of reasons.
Most particularly to support this 

53
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:49,010
educational endeavor that I've talked to
people about.

54
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:51,440
Right.
Our attempt to build an online education

55
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:53,780
system.
And so like it's a major hit.

56
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,781
Yeah.
And of course,

57
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:55,650
you know,
just to be clear,

58
00:02:55,651 --> 00:02:57,600
it's like when,
when we're doing my show,

59
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,730
I mean I don't have to tell everybody 
about Youtube d monetization,

60
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:01,564
but for example,
my show a week or two ago with the mom 

61
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:04,174
to Iti was demonetized by the algorithm.
Then demonetized further after manual 

62
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,160
review by a human,
so it's patriotic,

63
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,550
it's the,
it's the supporters,

64
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:13,384
the individual people that allow us to 
go ahead and do more of these 

65
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,170
controversial so to speak episode.
So yeah,

66
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,033
just nothing that we're doing right now 
is against the people that have 

67
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:25,380
supported us or our patrons or anything 
like that.

68
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:26,214
This is,
this is about making a stand against 

69
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:28,894
this ever moving encroachments on free 
speech and free expression and the rest 

70
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,124
of it,
and it's like this is one that we just 

71
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:36,340
feel is the right one to make the move 
on.

72
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,020
The reason that we jointly decided on 
January 15th well,

73
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:40,854
there was a couple of reasons.
The first was we thought that we might 

74
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:44,724
have something approximating an 
alternative potentially available for 

75
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:48,834
preliminary launch at that date.
Although we've decided to delay that 

76
00:03:51,661 --> 00:03:54,840
because the user interface needs work 
because that's the other thing,

77
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:55,674
right?
Is that their needs perhaps to be a 

78
00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:59,460
replacement for patron,
if that's a possibility,

79
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,693
like it's not obvious to me that 
corporations can run platforms for 

80
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,693
untrammeled communication successfully 
on the net in today's climate and that 

81
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,610
food,
anything I might design,

82
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,600
let's not,
let's not gloss over that.

83
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:15,434
I mean it might be possible that the 
Patriot method is not what's needed 

84
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:19,574
exactly for the future of the Internet.
I mean this is what we're trying to 

85
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:25,190
figure out right now,
which is why we've got every engineer,

86
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:26,024
I mean people from Google and facebook 
and Yahoo and everybody reaching out to 

87
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:32,270
us because it's like everyone's trying 
to solve this problem and it's still,

88
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:33,104
I mean,
one of the things we've been talking 

89
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:36,260
about now for the last while,
it's really for the last year,

90
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:37,094
but intensely in the last month is what 
actually is the problem itself because 

91
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:45,440
until we really figure out what the 
problem is.

92
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,633
Well,
I think,

93
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,563
I think the problem is
how to regulate an incredibly diverse 

94
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:52,724
range of opinions.
If such regulation needs to be 

95
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,520
instantiated,
we could take a limit case,

96
00:04:58,521 --> 00:04:59,354
for example,
the desire of companies like facebook 

97
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:05,210
not to have their platforms used for 
recruitment for Isis.

98
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,290
It's hard to make a case that that's not
a reasonable restriction.

99
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,473
Right.
But then,

100
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,503
but then the next issue is,
I think you could make an exception 

101
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:17,174
there because maybe you consider that a 
wartime exception or something like 

102
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:21,614
that.
But then the fundamental problem to me 

103
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:27,290
seems to be,
and I'll return again to that change the

104
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,124
terms website that a whole variety of 
companies and organizations spearheaded 

105
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:36,650
in not least by the southern poverty law
center,

106
00:05:36,651 --> 00:05:37,484
that hateful organization,
the worst that has decided that they're 

107
00:05:42,981 --> 00:05:47,180
going to
compel encourage.

108
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,460
Uh,
what

109
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,933
if fame,
perhaps companies that don't band 

110
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:58,880
together to what they see as hate 
speech.

111
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,150
Yeah,
and this is where,

112
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,080
well,
this is where the moving line is.

113
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:05,290
The key part of this,
because you can always find the free,

114
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,150
the most fringe cases.
You can always find isis on one side and

115
00:06:10,151 --> 00:06:10,984
you know,
the most fringe KKK white supremacist 

116
00:06:13,241 --> 00:06:15,670
group or whatever you want to call it on
the other side.

117
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:16,923
Well,
let's not forget southern poverty law 

118
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:19,060
center.
They've written things about you.

119
00:06:19,061 --> 00:06:19,894
They've written things about me.
I on Hirsi Ali and my gender wise and 

120
00:06:22,751 --> 00:06:27,751
Sam Harris and a litany of Majid sued 
them to,

121
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,420
to and actually want.
So there,

122
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:31,254
there is a push back,
but this is just another level of the 

123
00:06:33,221 --> 00:06:34,054
stand.
It's like they cannot be trusted to be 

124
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:40,420
on the boards of any of these 
organizations that are deciding,

125
00:06:40,421 --> 00:06:40,540
right.

126
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,910
What terms of services should have 
access.

127
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:48,090
It's really who should have access to 
the Internet isn't just about worse.

128
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,443
It's worse than outdated because when 
they start to pressure the credit card 

129
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:53,224
companies,
and I would consider this a warning to 

130
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:56,020
everyone who's listening.
He's like,

131
00:06:56,021 --> 00:06:57,760
okay,
let's think this through.

132
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,193
So the New York Times last week wrote an
article about the credit cards 

133
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:02,674
complicity in loaning money to that 
terrible tiny minority of people who 

134
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,053
engaged in mass shootings stating that 
it was the responsibility of the credit 

135
00:07:11,261 --> 00:07:14,560
card companies to monitor and 
potentially prevent that activity.

136
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:15,350
It's like,
okay,

137
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,080
so what's the,
what's the idea here?

138
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,423
The idea is that the companies to whom 
we have in trusted our monetary system 

139
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,933
in large parts,
that would be the credit card companies 

140
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,393
now get to review our spending patterns 
to determine if what we purchased is in 

141
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:32,494
accordance with that,
with what they regard as morally 

142
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:35,500
acceptable.
Okay.

143
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,910
And we think that's a good idea that 
that's where we're headed.

144
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,893
And Mastercard and visa and paypal are 
already starting to block people like 

145
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,203
they brought,
mastercard was instrumental in blocking 

146
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,183
Spencer,

147
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,650
Robert Spencer,
right?

148
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,180
It's Robert Spencer,
not retreats fancier.

149
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,860
Yes.
It's the best selling author and the guy

150
00:07:53,861 --> 00:07:58,861
who runs Jihad watch mastercard required
patron two d plot form him.

151
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,440
And just to be very clear,
they sent out a tweet,

152
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:04,050
which everyone can find.
I'm shocked that they haven't deleted it

153
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:07,290
yet where they said that they,
and they use this word,

154
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,850
which I think is the key to the whole 
thing.

155
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:09,684
They said that they unfortunately had to
delete his patrion because of 

156
00:08:14,341 --> 00:08:17,100
mastercard.
So what are they actually saying?

157
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:20,460
There are these patriot and saying,
oh we didn't want to delete your page,

158
00:08:20,461 --> 00:08:25,461
but mastercard forced our hand.
I mean that is some deeply scary.

159
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,693
Yeah.
Well then we have to talk about hate 

160
00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:30,780
speech because you know,
I think the whole concept of,

161
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,010
look,
obviously there is a,

162
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,060
people can be very nasty when they 
communicate,

163
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,303
but the idea that there's an 
identifiable category and you can put 

164
00:08:44,251 --> 00:08:45,084
boundaries around it and turn it hate 
speech and then you can produce 

165
00:08:47,521 --> 00:08:48,354
committees or deal with people on a one 
to one basis as patron is doing without 

166
00:08:53,161 --> 00:08:57,540
any central policy or let's,
despite their central policy or that you

167
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,374
could turn that into an algorithm that 
could validly identify hate speech 

168
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:03,990
without producing false positives.
Right.

169
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:04,824
Without accusing people who shouldn't be
accused of violating all of that's just 

170
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,220
completely,
it's just beggars the imagination as far

171
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:12,054
as,
well,

172
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,540
of course.
And you're also just opening a Pandora's

173
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,700
box from hell because just in the last 
couple of days,

174
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:17,534
I don't know if you saw this,
but the women's march in California 

175
00:09:19,251 --> 00:09:22,460
canceled their rally because they felt 
that it was too white.

176
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,280
Yup.
Now imagine if they canceled their rally

177
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:27,560
because it was too black or too anything
else.

178
00:09:27,561 --> 00:09:29,600
It's like,
so does that count as,

179
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:30,434
hey,
are you guys now being racist against 

180
00:09:31,551 --> 00:09:34,810
white people and now we know that that 
wouldn't be a problem for these guys.

181
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:39,910
One of the things that I can't fathom in
some sense is the lack of imagination on

182
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:41,114
the part of the people who are engaging 
in censorship of what they regard as 

183
00:09:44,931 --> 00:09:48,260
hate speech.
Like there's an old military adage which

184
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:52,280
is that if you invent a weapon it will 
be used by your enemy within 15 years.

185
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,840
Okay,
so why?

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,833
What makes the people on the on the left
because they're the ones who are doing 

187
00:09:58,401 --> 00:10:03,401
this as you can clearly see in the 
change the terms website,

188
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,293
what makes them so sure that exactly the
same tactics won't be used against them 

189
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,670
like at the drop of a hat once,
once the tactics have been validated and

190
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:14,504
put in place.

191
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,583
I think it's either,
it's either just very shortsightedness 

192
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,403
on their hand or they think that they 
can actually stamp out enough hate 

193
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,740
within that very small window before it 
would turn on them.

194
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,750
Or they just don't think these things 
fully through

195
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,943
or,
or there's another just another 

196
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:29,914
possibility too,
which is that there are so opposed to 

197
00:10:32,411 --> 00:10:33,244
the fundamental structures of the West 
that let's say and regard them as so 

198
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:38,504
patriarchal and oppressive,
that they'd be willing to take the risk 

199
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:41,524
of sacrificing their own free speech 
just to have there what have their 

200
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:48,040
destructive way,
something like that.

201
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,460
We should also acknowledge that in the 
New York Times piece that was written,

202
00:10:52,461 --> 00:10:54,720
which was written by Nellie Bowles,
who wrote the,

203
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,830
the now infamous piece about you and 
Enforcement Origami,

204
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,950
uh,
that the quote that Jacqueline Hart,

205
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,980
who is the head of trust and safety over
a patriot.

206
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,813
No,
there's no hidden who has no grounding 

207
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:11,610
in philosophy or any of the background 
training that might be necessary to even

208
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:14,670
remotely begin to participate properly 
in such a thing.

209
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,591
No,
of course not.

210
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,180
But,
so the quote that she gave Nellie in the

211
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:22,290
article said that you can't say these,
I'm loosely quoting this now.

212
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,110
You can't say these words on our 
platform,

213
00:11:25,111 --> 00:11:25,944
referring to Carl,
referring to him saying the n word in 

214
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:29,480
that video,
which we,

215
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,620
which we know they were using out of 
context and all that,

216
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,100
but he never set it on their platform.
He never said it on patriotic.

217
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,990
He didn't even say it on his own 
channel.

218
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:38,250
That was you,
you know,

219
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:40,740
using Patrion for the funding.
So there was a,

220
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,960
it's almost the entire story was built 
on quicksand that tried to put out there

221
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:46,681
on the New York Times.
Now,

222
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:47,514
of course myself and many other people 
tweet the hell out of it and gets 

223
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:51,864
hundreds and thousands probably of 
retweets and comments to Nellie and she 

224
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:56,254
doesn't respond.
Nor does the New York Times issue any 

225
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:03,001
sort of correction about the most 
fundamental piece of the story was alive

226
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,370
and they don't have,
they don't have a problem doing that.

227
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:09,850
So that's why this is so layered about 
speech and finance

228
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,913
and journalists.
Amazing to see journalists take the 

229
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,043
journey.
One of the things that happened in 

230
00:12:16,891 --> 00:12:19,380
Canada to me was that,
you know,

231
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,383
after I made the initial videos that 
caused such a political furor was that 

232
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,860
once the main journalists in Canada sort
of figured out what I was doing,

233
00:12:28,861 --> 00:12:32,190
they all came out in my support.
Like the post media group,

234
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:33,024
which is 200 newspapers all came out to 
support what I was doing because they 

235
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:37,500
realize that,
oh,

236
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:41,040
they're journalists.
Apart from Comedians,

237
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:41,903
there isn't anybody who relies more on 
the principle of free speech to justify 

238
00:12:46,261 --> 00:12:50,370
and allow their occupation even to exist
for the New York Times.

239
00:12:50,371 --> 00:12:54,020
Not Too understand that this threat is 
a,

240
00:12:54,021 --> 00:12:54,854
also a threat to everything upon which 
their entire organization has been 

241
00:12:58,341 --> 00:12:59,174
predicated is also an indication of that
same kind of willful blindness that 

242
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:05,600
we've already been discussing.
But having said that,

243
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:09,400
I would still like to say I think the 
biggest danger here I really,

244
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,440
and it's just made my jaw drop over the 
last couple of weeks thinking about it,

245
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,303
is the fact that the credit card 
companies are now taking it upon 

246
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:22,090
themselves to potentially police the 
activities of their users.

247
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,640
It's like my God,
is that really,

248
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,010
I just,
I just can't believe that

249
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,913
any sensible person would think that 
through and then want to live in a 

250
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:33,724
society where your spending habits are 
being monitored by the company that 

251
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:40,840
basically produces your money.
Well,

252
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,570
think of anything more totalitarian than
that.

253
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,440
Toso loosely quote our friend Eric 
Weinstein.

254
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:49,140
Should Republicans be allowed to use 
roads that,

255
00:13:49,141 --> 00:13:49,974
that sort of where we're headed here,
that every public good will be 

256
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:57,090
eventually decided,
can you access to it?

257
00:13:57,091 --> 00:13:58,530
Will you have access to water?
It should,

258
00:13:58,531 --> 00:13:59,061
uh,
should,

259
00:13:59,061 --> 00:13:59,894
uh,
an avowed white supremacist right now 

260
00:14:01,561 --> 00:14:04,650
that is potentially watching this or 
lives in America somewhere.

261
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,350
She,
one of the 50 of the,

262
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,933
one of the 42 of them should,
should they have access to water at 

263
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:13,044
their home?
Should they allow to be able to get 

264
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,820
electricity at their home or phone lines
or all of these things?

265
00:14:17,821 --> 00:14:20,160
I mean,
this is where we're headed.

266
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:24,540
Especially when you ever expand the 
definition of who that person is.

267
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,180
Yeah.
They won't in China.

268
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,150
Right?
Well,

269
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,170
that's where they're going.
Right.

270
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:30,280
So is that the test case?

271
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,470
Well,
I think it's,

272
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,753
it's an indication that the fact that 
the Chinese have been tempted into this 

273
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,893
is also an indication of the temptation.
It's intrinsic in the technological 

274
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:43,590
power.
The credit card companies are in a weird

275
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,760
situation as far as I'm concerned 
because the only reason they work at all

276
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,300
is because people actually trust them 
completely.

277
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,240
I just like,
oh,

278
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,570
you're just a proxy for money.
Like you're a proxy for cash.

279
00:14:57,571 --> 00:14:58,404
In fact,
that's basically how the mastercard 

280
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:01,350
advertises itself,
right?

281
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:02,603
So you're a proxy for cash and the 
government doesn't watch what you spend 

282
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:10,010
your money on except an extraordinarily 
extraordinarily limited cases.

283
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,440
I mean there are money laundering laws 
and so forth,

284
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,230
but that's a direct violation of a law,
right?

285
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,103
That's part of tracking down criminal 
activity that it has nothing to do so 

286
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:19,734
far with with hate speech,
which by the way is protected by the 

287
00:15:23,521 --> 00:15:24,354
first amendment.
So or which means in some sense that it 

288
00:15:27,271 --> 00:15:28,560
doesn't exist.
You know,

289
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:29,550
as a,
as a legal,

290
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,600
as a legal
concept.

291
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,470
It doesn't.
This is my Canada,

292
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,713
which is,
we shouldn't gloss over that fact too 

293
00:15:36,991 --> 00:15:37,824
because you know you are and we just did
however many countries in Europe and 

294
00:15:40,861 --> 00:15:41,694
we're going to go back this spring and 
it's like everybody that we met was 

295
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:50,721
jealous of the freedoms that we have in 
the United States relative to speech.

296
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,983
You know what I mean?
And everybody that would come up to us 

297
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:54,420
after the show,
holy cow,

298
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:55,254
I wish we could say that.
I wish we didn't worry about this or 

299
00:15:57,031 --> 00:15:57,864
that or jokes or the rest of it.
And we did that video in Oslo where you 

300
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:03,360
talked about Danky Ila and it's like 
they're,

301
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:04,194
they're jealous of our freedom.
So we should be very clear here that 

302
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,793
though you're right,
because we now have a payment processor 

303
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:11,664
issue,
which is an indirect connection to 

304
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:17,250
whatever it is that we're trying to 
build out here.

305
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:18,940
And we're still,
it's a little a morphous

306
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:19,963
at the moment

307
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,290
is that it's changing because a lot of 
people are saying,

308
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,240
all right,
you guys really want to solve this.

309
00:16:25,241 --> 00:16:29,710
Then you have to go full crypto.
The video has to be hosted.

310
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:30,540
Crypto.
Yeah.

311
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,290
The finances have to be hosted or have 
to be done via crypto.

312
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,800
All of these things,
these are,

313
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,890
these are major,
major things that we're trying to figure

314
00:16:38,891 --> 00:16:39,724
out on every front.
Certain payment processors are a little 

315
00:16:41,711 --> 00:16:43,870
more willing to stand up to the mob than
others.

316
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:47,080
So we're talking to different people.
I mean we'll really going on everything

317
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,301
that's right.
Well,

318
00:16:48,301 --> 00:16:51,870
the tentative platform that we're trying
to build and to build carefully,

319
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,423
we'll provide the possibility of 
multiple payment portals in the hope 

320
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,660
that they creators will be less 
susceptible to being rapidly shutdown or

321
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:06,750
perhaps shutdown at all.
But you know,

322
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,840
only a fool would say that that problem 
is going to be definitively solved.

323
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,990
I have some real increasing sympathy for
the crypto currency types.

324
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,393
No,
but the problem there is that as far as 

325
00:17:18,391 --> 00:17:19,224
I can tell,
their solution is still sufficiently 

326
00:17:22,171 --> 00:17:23,004
technically complex to keep it out of 
the mainstream use and also not 

327
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:27,944
sufficiently liquid to actually 
constitute a realistic current 

328
00:17:32,141 --> 00:17:34,180
replacement even for credit cards.

329
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,523
Right.
So one of the things we've been 

330
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:36,904
discussing is that it's almost like we 
have to have several markers down the 

331
00:17:40,241 --> 00:17:41,074
road to figure out what the real 
solution is because not everything can 

332
00:17:44,561 --> 00:17:49,561
be solved in terms of terms of service 
tomorrow related to that exists.

333
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,870
Not Everything can be solved tomorrow 
related to the payment processors may be

334
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:55,704
crypto really is the ultimate answer,
but it's not the answer tomorrow for 

335
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:00,390
everything.
So we're,

336
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:03,250
we're really,
we're plotting out a lot here,

337
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:07,420
but it seems like a fresh and sort of 
fitting way to start the year.

338
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,140
I think

339
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,990
so.
And so for January 15th I mean,

340
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,910
part of the reason that we picked that 
date,

341
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,283
as I said before,
it was because we thought we might have 

342
00:18:15,551 --> 00:18:18,490
something to announce with regards to an
alternative platform,

343
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:21,720
but you know,
saner heads have prevailed in that

344
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,513
calmer heads.

345
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:25,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

346
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,653
And also we want it to give people an 
opportunity to decide what they wanted 

347
00:18:29,841 --> 00:18:31,550
to do it without just springing it on 
them.

348
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,384
I mean,
I have some real admiration for Harris 

349
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:37,590
for acting so immediately.
Definitively.

350
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,170
Yeah.
It's funny,

351
00:18:39,171 --> 00:18:40,640
you know,
I saw some criticism,

352
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:41,301
it's like,
all right,

353
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:42,134
well Sam dropped immediately and look 
you and Peter said you're still there 

354
00:18:44,421 --> 00:18:45,254
and you're talking about this whole 
thing and it's like we all have 

355
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:50,210
different things to consider.
We all have different family situations,

356
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:52,820
different business situations,
different livelihood situations,

357
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:53,654
everything.
So it's like we were really trying to 

358
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:58,040
just plot this thing out properly and to
be very clear,

359
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:01,550
we're still in the process of that.
So for any sort of,

360
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,403
for anyone watching this right now,
if you're supporting Jordan on Patriot 

361
00:19:06,261 --> 00:19:08,990
or you're supporting me on Patriot or 
both of us or whatever it is,

362
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,213
it's like now we're trying to shift 
people because at least by getting off 

363
00:19:13,341 --> 00:19:14,174
patriotic the moment we remove one of 
the middlemen and you can now go 

364
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:18,674
directly,
go to directly to Jordan b peterson.com 

365
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:24,620
or [inaudible] dot com and you can at 
least if you want to donate,

366
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:28,130
you can do that for now while we figure 
out everything else.

367
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,413
And that way we removed one of the 
pieces here because there's just too 

368
00:19:31,701 --> 00:19:34,820
many pieces here that are creating this 
mess.

369
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,393
I think it's too much to hope for a 
perfect solution to a very complex 

370
00:19:39,551 --> 00:19:41,150
problem.
And um,

371
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,303
we're muddling through the best we can 
and hopefully people will regard our 

372
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,003
decision joint decision too.
Leave Patriot as a step in the right 

373
00:19:53,481 --> 00:19:56,570
direction,
however imperfectly taken.

374
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,480
Yeah.
Well look,

375
00:19:58,481 --> 00:20:01,240
I think I said it before,
but I really think that,

376
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,420
and maybe this will be the defining,
uh,

377
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:10,170
idea of 2019 is that I think we're 
basically at the point where people have

378
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:11,704
to decide what sort of internet they 
want and it's not only what sort of 

379
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:15,874
internet,
it's really what sort of freedom do you 

380
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:22,651
want in a digital world and either or do
you want any or do you want any,

381
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:25,900
and maybe maybe you don't or you don't 
want to think about it and you just want

382
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:28,660
to play fortnight and watch porn and 
never think it through.

383
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,530
I'm assuming that you'll be allowed to 
watch porn,

384
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,183
right?
So that now you really are a pilot or 

385
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,020
play for that matter.
Right.

386
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:41,100
So the
games of violence should be allowed.

387
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,880
What makes you think that credit card 
companies should allow you to use their,

388
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,640
their funds to purchase first,
first person shooter games for example,

389
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,490
or any game where anyone has killed?

390
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,220
No,
you're totally right.

391
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,063
That's,
I mean that sounds completely dystopian 

392
00:20:55,651 --> 00:20:56,484
and yet it seems like that would just be
the next encroachment that we would see 

393
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:00,450
here.
So the point at the end,

394
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:04,950
at the end of this is I think everyone 
for for 2019 since it's the first day of

395
00:21:04,951 --> 00:21:05,784
the year,
it's like you have to think about what 

396
00:21:06,691 --> 00:21:11,430
type of Internet do you want,
what type of ability to communicate with

397
00:21:11,431 --> 00:21:12,264
other people do you want?
And if you want something that's a 

398
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:16,530
little better than what we've got right 
now,

399
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,540
we better stand up quick because this 
window we,

400
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,523
we know it's closing slowly,
but we never know when it's going to 

401
00:21:22,471 --> 00:21:24,700
really slap shot quick.
So,

402
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,780
so we're working on it and,
and I think people are ready to stand up

403
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:28,620
with us.
I really do.

404
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,493
We might also suggest to people,
and this is of course up to everyone 

405
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:35,110
who's feeling this to decide,
but you know,

406
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,993
couple of thousand letters to mastercard
and paypal and visa indicating 

407
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,443
pronounced displeasure at their plans to
become a custodians of the monetary 

408
00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:52,000
supply for ethical reasons might also be
an order.

409
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,270
You know,
these companies are responsive to public

410
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:56,104
pressure,
which is perhaps partly why they're 

411
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,250
determining to play the role of censor 
to begin with.

412
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,030
You know,
they're,

413
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,863
they are facing pressure from these,
let's call them activist interest 

414
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:06,260
groups,
who again,

415
00:22:06,261 --> 00:22:09,350
are outlined on change the terms on the 
website,

416
00:22:09,351 --> 00:22:13,160
change the terms and they're responding 
to public pressure.

417
00:22:13,161 --> 00:22:17,020
And that's understandable.
MMM.

418
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,510
It's understandable,
but

419
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,893
yeah,
but inexcusable in certain in a certain 

420
00:22:26,871 --> 00:22:27,704
regard,
but the right way perhaps to begin to 

421
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,693
push back is to let the credit card 
companies know that there's a 

422
00:22:34,371 --> 00:22:35,204
constituency on the other side that I s 
I suspect constitutes the vast majority 

423
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:45,791
of credit card users.
The silent middle majority of let's say,

424
00:22:46,101 --> 00:22:49,850
Western society who were neither 
radically right nor radically left,

425
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:50,983
who would just as soon not have their 
spending habits monitored by giant 

426
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:56,760
corporations.
That's pretty funny too,

427
00:22:56,761 --> 00:23:01,340
that the left is so opposed to corporate
entities,

428
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,380
you know,
on principle,

429
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:04,214
especially to sizable ones and you know,
have a certain justification for being 

430
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:12,500
skeptical about the moral direction of 
very large organizations,

431
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:13,603
um,
are so eager to hand over the reigns of 

432
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:17,894
social control to precisely the 
companies you'd think they would be 

433
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:23,180
least likely to crawl into bed with.
I mean,

434
00:23:23,181 --> 00:23:25,590
really mastercard visa,
it's like right.

435
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,653
Or at the same time they'll,
they want to hand over more control to 

436
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:30,580
the government to handle these things.
And,

437
00:23:30,581 --> 00:23:34,010
and we should be pretty clear that in 
the last couple of weeks that we've been

438
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:34,844
discussing this,
every single discussion that we've had 

439
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,213
about this,
I don't think once did we entertain the 

440
00:23:40,141 --> 00:23:40,771
idea of,
Oh,

441
00:23:40,771 --> 00:23:43,470
we've got to get the government involved
to fix this thing.

442
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,280
I mean,
there,

443
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,113
there could be,
as,

444
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:49,160
as you referenced earlier,
there could be specific legal,

445
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,970
uh,
issues that pop up related to collusion.

446
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,300
And signed a couple of other things.
Cartel developed.

447
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:55,760
Cocked.
Yeah,

448
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,200
like that sort of thing.
But,

449
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,100
but the beauty of this,
and again why I'm so,

450
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,150
I'm watching my monthly rev of my 
company go down even though we're,

451
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,530
we're making some of it back,
but as I'm watching that happen,

452
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:08,300
as I said to you last time,
I'm,

453
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:09,134
I'm incredibly inspired right now 
because literally thousands of emails 

454
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:15,920
are pouring in from people that want to 
work with us,

455
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:16,783
that want to help us,
that want to figure out how to fund 

456
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,950
things or that want to work as engineers
or the rest of it.

457
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,310
And that tells you that,
that people are,

458
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:26,144
people are afraid and they see this 
problem and they just want some 

459
00:24:28,821 --> 00:24:32,300
solutions and,
and maybe there isn't an easy solution.

460
00:24:32,301 --> 00:24:33,134
As you said,

461
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,273
there have also been talking with you 
online with a whole bunch of the people 

462
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:41,330
who've been loosely aggregated under the
ages of the intellectual dark web.

463
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:45,050
And that's probably 30 people that,
that we've been communicating with,

464
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,213
with a variety of peripheral people.
And it's also useful to let people know 

465
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,613
that every one of those people is 
unbelievably concerned about what 

466
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:57,370
happened to Carl Benjamin to,
sorry,

467
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,041
sorry,
go on.

468
00:24:58,041 --> 00:24:58,874
And even more so
dumbstruck by the collusion payment 

469
00:25:04,621 --> 00:25:05,454
processing companies and,
and the emergence of this activist 

470
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,223
infrastructure online that's devoted 
specifically to the suppression of free 

471
00:25:15,211 --> 00:25:16,044
speech.

472
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:20,950
And also we should also note that within
that group of say 30 or so white people,

473
00:25:20,951 --> 00:25:25,470
we all sort of look,
we agree on basic fundamental principles

474
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:27,090
related to free speech and things like 
that,

475
00:25:27,091 --> 00:25:30,000
but there's a lot of disagreement on how
to move forward with this.

476
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:30,893
I mean,
we're talking it out respectfully as we 

477
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:33,510
always do,
but some people are saying,

478
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,940
stay in fight on Patrion because this is
how,

479
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:36,774
you know,
they're small enough say that you might 

480
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:40,470
get them to change.
Some people are saying you gotta go.

481
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,020
That's when people are saying some 
version of,

482
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,973
you know,
mixing those

483
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,170
and nobody's clear about the proper 
pathway forward.

484
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,610
Yeah.
But that's again,

485
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:50,444
I mean I think this is what the 
brilliance of human ingenuity is all 

486
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:54,320
about.
It's like we're,

487
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:55,154
they're going to be some pitfalls in 
front of us and staying would have its 

488
00:25:57,171 --> 00:26:00,460
risks and leaving would average risks 
and we're all going to do what we think

489
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,550
is why we've already discussed that too,
right,

490
00:26:02,551 --> 00:26:04,110
is that there's,
there's no,

491
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,210
there's no known risk option here and 
like,

492
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,213
and so we're taking the risk of leaving 
and then we're gonna make the best of 

493
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:14,440
it.
I mean often when you take a risky,

494
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,483
often in life,
all you have is a choice between two 

495
00:26:17,111 --> 00:26:20,950
different risks and sometimes neither of
them are risks you would like to take.

496
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,273
Then in the aftermath of that decision,
a new field of possibility opens up in 

497
00:26:26,561 --> 00:26:27,394
front of you too and whether or not you 
made the right decision is actually a 

498
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:33,460
consequence of how well you manage the 
aftermath of that decision.

499
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,773
So we'll,
we'll keep talking over the next couple 

500
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:42,250
of months on like I've got good people 
working on this alternative,

501
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,841
you know,
which,

502
00:26:43,841 --> 00:26:47,740
which was,
as I mentioned in other places,

503
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:53,140
started seven months ago or so.
And good people supervising it,

504
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:57,150
whether it'll turn out to be a viable 
product and whether or not we can figure

505
00:26:57,151 --> 00:27:01,410
out how to implement it in a sustainable
way that actually addresses these issues

506
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,880
in a reasonable manner remains to be 
seen

507
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,240
on a,
on a personal note,

508
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:07,170
just because,
uh,

509
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:08,880
you know,
I got to see you a couple of days before

510
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:11,630
Christmas in West Palm Beach and,
and we had dinner with uh,

511
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,140
with your family and your kids and 
everything.

512
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,193
It hasn't,
it's sort of been nice cause I did a 

513
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:16,230
week with,
uh,

514
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:18,960
with my brother and sister and nieces 
and nephews over Christmas.

515
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:22,710
Also sort of circling back to family on 
some of this.

516
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:22,941
Uh,
it,

517
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:25,500
it,
it's given me a lot of perspective.

518
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,790
You know,
it it mean cause I'm getting,

519
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:27,624
I'm getting reached out by so many 
different people on all different 

520
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:30,324
fronts,
but then to have sort of a close knit 

521
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:35,730
group of people that really do have your
interest in mind and all those things

522
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,180
with your kids at dinner,
it was like,

523
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,430
oh these are good people to

524
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,443
nymity on the part of the people around 
me that the proper thing to do is 

525
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:47,763
twofold.
One is to separate myself from Patrion 

526
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:51,723
in accordance with our discussions.
And the second is to proceed with 

527
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:59,360
exceeding caution and not over promise,
um,

528
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:04,390
or try to deliver to quickly a solution,
although to work on that carefully.

529
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,860
So that's what we've decided to do.

530
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:07,863
Yeah.
So let's just be crystal clear on that 

531
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:09,970
latter,
latter part.

532
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,850
We are working on this.
We're going to be deliberate.

533
00:28:12,851 --> 00:28:13,684
We are going to be cautious.
We understand that it can't be solved 

534
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,194
tomorrow.
We understand that there's a financial 

535
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:19,834
part of free speech part and everything 
else and we're just going to lay these 

536
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:23,374
things out in front of us and we're 
going to keep working through it with a 

537
00:28:24,731 --> 00:28:27,550
lot of the people that you guys know and
trust and,

538
00:28:27,551 --> 00:28:28,990
and,
and with,

539
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,260
with some other people.
And,

540
00:28:30,261 --> 00:28:32,500
and hearing from random people that have
given us ideas.

541
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,330
I mean,
I've been forwarding you emails left and

542
00:28:34,331 --> 00:28:35,380
right where people are like,
you know,

543
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,214
this might be the,
the pressure point you might want to go 

544
00:28:38,441 --> 00:28:39,880
after,
so we're just going to keep,

545
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,190
Yup.
Yup.

546
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,323
Okay.
Well I got a couple of things to end 

547
00:28:45,371 --> 00:28:47,410
this.
I guess let's summarize it then.

548
00:28:47,411 --> 00:28:49,600
I've got a couple of things just to let 
people know about.

549
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,180
Uh,
well the first is,

550
00:28:54,181 --> 00:28:55,014
so we're both leaving on January 15th 
and the second is we're working on this 

551
00:28:57,691 --> 00:28:58,524
platform and the third is a warning to 
people to keep a close eye on what the 

552
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:03,024
credit card companies are up to because 
that's a really bad thing in my 

553
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:08,920
estimation.
I guess that's probably it on my front.

554
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:09,754
I have a talk coming up in Zurich.
I have a couple of talks in California 

555
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,670
in January.
I'll be with you on those.

556
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,583
Yup.
And the tickets to those are available 

557
00:29:17,981 --> 00:29:22,981
on my website@jordanbpeterson.com and 
the final thing is I also set up with my

558
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,124
partners as a new years token.
Let's say that future authoring program 

559
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,233
from the self authoring suite and we put
it up at 50% off with the code and why 

560
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:39,861
2019 and so if anybody's out there wants
to make some personal,

561
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,540
what do you call those resolutions for 
the New Year,

562
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,270
then this program is an ideal way of 
doing that.

563
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:50,360
And so that's also partly a thank you to
everyone who um,

564
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:54,420
has been so supportive and interested in
the last year.

565
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:59,740
And so I think that's basically,
I think that's basically that.

566
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:00,963
What do you think?

567
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,680
No,
I think that's basically it.

568
00:30:02,681 --> 00:30:07,681
So I'll just quickly give a shout out to
Dave rubin.com/donate and what we're,

569
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:08,734
what we're trying to do,
and I know you're trying to do this as 

570
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:10,924
well,
is that for whoever signs up now and 

571
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:13,271
we're,
we're taking,

572
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:15,790
it's one time and monthly donations that
you can do.

573
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,223
There are going to be ways that we think
once we build out whatever it is we're 

574
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:20,734
working on that,
that it'll all be able to be flipped 

575
00:30:22,631 --> 00:30:23,464
into that.
So it's not like we're going to have 

576
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:27,610
people constantly having to start new 
accounts or,

577
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,570
or,
you know,

578
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,310
sign up for new things or anything like 
that.

579
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:32,980
We're trying to make this as easy as 
possible for everybody.

580
00:30:32,981 --> 00:30:34,630
And they'll look,
there's going to be some bumps,

581
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,493
but

582
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,920
this is it.
Say about 2019 there's going to be,

583
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,350
there's going to be some bumps.
Well,

584
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,110
I don't know if you know this Jordan,
but we got an American election come and

585
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:47,310
the year after that.
So

586
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,340
Mr Ruben,
happy new year.

587
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,550
All right,
happy new year,

588
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:54,384
brother.
