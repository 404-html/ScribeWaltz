1
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:09,823
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,013
My name is Barbara Ferrari and I am the 
financial director at students in 

3
00:00:16,691 --> 00:00:18,310
support of free speech at York 
University.

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,373
I'll keep all the insurance for tonight 
short cause we really don't have any 

5
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:23,450
time.
Um,

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,333
if you're ever traveling downtown on a 
Tuesday night around seven o'clock and 

7
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:30,970
you pass by the Isabelle Theater,
the Isabel Bader theater,

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,630
you'll see hundreds of people,
about 500 people lined up outside.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,170
And you'll ask yourself,
why are there these older people,

10
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:39,004
younger people,
why is everyone just outside waiting in 

11
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:42,730
a line?
And it's confusing.

12
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,920
You think maybe there's a celebrity 
there.

13
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,783
You know,
it turns out it's professor Peterson 

14
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:51,220
discussing the psychological 
significance of the biblical stories.

15
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,410
Hundreds

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,480
[inaudible]

17
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:08,060
hundreds and hundreds of people sold out
crowds every single week.

18
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,980
And I often ask myself,
what is it about Professor Peterson that

19
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,100
just attract such a large audience?
And for me personally,

20
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,083
it's how genuine he is when he speaks.
Many times you'll see them get on stage 

21
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:23,480
and be emotional and you don't really 
get that from many speakers.

22
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,620
Also the professors command of the 
English language is,

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,190
it's so eloquent and yet so simple to 
understand which use.

24
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,024
It's really unfound nowadays.
It's really amazing to have professor 

25
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:36,794
Peterson here cause he was the initial 
inspiration behind students and support 

26
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:40,400
a free speech.

27
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,130
[inaudible]

28
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,110
on that note,
it is my pleasure to introduce professor

29
00:01:59,111 --> 00:01:59,950
Jordan Peterson.

30
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:05,370
[inaudible].

31
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,820
I'm going to talk to you a bit briefly 
about why postmodernism is wrong.

32
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,543
And I actually mean technically wrong,
apart from ethically wrong and morally 

33
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:42,520
wrong and intellectually and emotionally
rolling practically wrong.

34
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,190
But I'll give the devil his due to begin
with because they are actually wrestling

35
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:51,550
with quite a difficult problem.
And the founders of postmodernism,

36
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:52,384
we're by no means I'm unintelligent 
individuals and they actually put their 

37
00:02:56,651 --> 00:02:57,484
finger on quite an important problem.
The important problem that they put 

38
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,413
their finger on was the fact that any 
set of phenomena has a near infinite 

39
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:07,054
number of potential interpretations.
And that actually happens to be the 

40
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:12,040
case.
Uh,

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,150
that that fact,
let's say,

42
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,490
was discovered simultaneously in a 
number of different disciplines.

43
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,373
Um,
one of the most surprising it was 

44
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:21,994
artificial intelligence and the 
artificial intelligence people ran into 

45
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:24,994
that conundrum when they learned that it
was much more difficult to make a 

46
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:30,460
machine that could perceive the world 
that had originally been supposed,

47
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,620
you know,
we're supposed to have autonomous robots

48
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:33,221
and or,
and,

49
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:36,070
and functional artificial intelligence 
backed by the late sixties.

50
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,190
And of course that didn't happen.
And part of the reason for that was that

51
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:40,024
the artificial intelligence researchers,
when they were starting to instantiate 

52
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:47,800
perception into their machines,
learned that charting your course in the

53
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:48,634
world might be a trivial problem in 
comparison to determining how to 

54
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:52,984
perceive the world.
And the reason for that is that there's 

55
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,490
a very large number of ways to perceive 
the world.

56
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,713
And the postmodernist actually caught 
onto this and one of the claims they 

57
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:04,390
made was that while there's a near 
infinite number of ways to interpret any

58
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:07,450
given text,
and that actually also happens to be the

59
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:08,890
case.
And then they said,

60
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:09,724
well,
since there's a near infinite number of 

61
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:11,494
ways to interpret any texts,
how do you know that any given 

62
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:13,984
interpretation should,
should take precedence over any other 

63
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:17,074
interpretation,
which is also a perfectly reasonable 

64
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,980
issue.
Um,

65
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,913
they went off the rails very rapidly 
after putting forward that set of 

66
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:24,670
propositions.

67
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,210
And that's partly why they also kept 
their alliance with Marxism.

68
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:31,300
Because the problem with postmodernism 
fundamentally is that if you,

69
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,473
um,
agree with the proposition that all 

70
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:37,360
interpretations of all phenomena are of 
equal value or lack of value,

71
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,194
then you can't act in the world.
And the problem with that is that if 

72
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:41,104
you're a human being,
you have to act in the world because 

73
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:44,380
otherwise you,
you,

74
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,370
you suffer miserably and then you die.
And that seems to be,

75
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,340
that seems to be an unacceptable outcome
for most people.

76
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:54,270
So the issue with postmodernism isn't so
much the,

77
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,323
the erroneous claim that there are very 
large number of interpretations for any 

78
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:00,550
given phenomena,
including the meaning of a text.

79
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,773
The error in postmodernism is the 
failure to recognize that there are a 

80
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:08,260
finite number of credible 
interpretations of phenomena.

81
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,453
And also a refusal to engage with the 
intellectual problem that determining 

82
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:15,640
what that finite set might actually 
consist of.

83
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,190
And I will,
I'll just give you a very brief overview

84
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:21,430
of how it is that we happen to solve 
this problem as human beings.

85
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:25,780
And we do it partly biologically because
we inhabit a biological framework that's

86
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:28,930
been developed over the course of about 
3.5 million years.

87
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,830
That severely constrains the manner in 
which we interpret the world.

88
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,210
And it constrains it such that we tend 
to only manifests,

89
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,044
spontaneously manifest interpretations 
of the world that don't result in undue 

90
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:42,004
suffering and our demise.
And there's plenty of ways to be stupid 

91
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:45,754
enough to parish.
And there's plenty of ways to be stupid 

92
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:48,184
enough to suffer without meaning.
But there aren't very many ways to live 

93
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:51,844
properly and carefully for a long period
of time in a manner that doesn't also 

94
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:56,800
similar caneously do harm to other 
people.

95
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,063
And so that's the second set of 
constraints is that you have biological 

96
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:01,760
constraints on your perception.

97
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,400
Then they're built in as a consequence 
of a Darwinian process.

98
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:05,234
And the second part is that you're 
forced to interact with yourself now in 

99
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:10,814
this week,
next week and the week after and the 

100
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,040
month after and the year after.
So you have to conduct yourself in a way

101
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,580
that doesn't interfere with your future 
life as you're living now.

102
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:20,414
And simultaneously you have to conduct 
yourself in a way that makes all the 

103
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:24,044
other people around you want to 
cooperate with you and compete with you 

104
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,620
and maintain their relationship with you
and do that today and next week and next

105
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,260
month,
the next year and so on into the future.

106
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:34,094
So there are sip,
although there are very large number of 

107
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:37,034
interpretations of the world,
there are unbelievably severe 

108
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:43,010
constraints on the number of functional 
interpretations there are in the world.

109
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:43,844
And one of the things that the 
humanities was supposed to be educating 

110
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:47,054
people with regards towards 
understanding was what the universe of 

111
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:53,060
those finite functional interpretations 
might be.

112
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,043
And that's been more or less abandoned 
by the universities under the guise of 

113
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:57,890
postmodernism.
Um,

114
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,503
the,
the fact that the postmodernist is dare 

115
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,140
to be Marxist is also something that I 
find,

116
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,930
I would say not so much intellectually 
reprehensible,

117
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:08,750
as morally repugnant.
And one of the things that,

118
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,690
one of the things that the 
postmodernists postmodern,

119
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:15,200
Neo Marxists continually claim is that 
they have nothing but compassion for the

120
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,034
downtrodden.
And I would say that anybody with more 

121
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:18,944
than a cursory knowledge of 20th century
history who dares to claim 

122
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,944
simultaneously that they have compassion
for the downtrodden and that they're 

123
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:26,564
marxists are revealing either their 
ignorance of history that is so 

124
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:33,380
astounding that it's actually a form of 
miracle or a kind of

125
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,013
aura kind of malevolence that's so 
reprehensible that it's almost 

126
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:42,560
unspeakable because we already ran the 
equity experiment over the course of the

127
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:45,250
20th century and we already know what 
the,

128
00:07:45,251 --> 00:07:48,800
the Marxist doctrines have done for all 
press people all around the world.

129
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,030
And the answer that mostly was in 
prison,

130
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,320
in slave imprisoned them,
enslaved them,

131
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,320
work them to death or execute them.
And as far as I can tell,

132
00:07:57,321 --> 00:08:00,350
that's not precisely commensurate with 
any message of compassion.

133
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,633
And so I don't think that the postmodern
neo Marxist have a leg to stand on 

134
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:06,260
ethically or intellectually or 
emotionally or,

135
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,423
and I think that they should be gone 
after as hard as possible from an 

136
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:12,260
intellectual perspective and informed 
intellectual perspective.

137
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:14,210
And this is fundamentally a war of 
ideas.

138
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,313
And that's the,
that's the level of analysis that it 

139
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:19,940
should be thought upon.
And not only is it a war of ideas,

140
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:22,310
I think it's one that can be one because
I think that the,

141
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,730
especially the French intellectual 
postmodernists or a pack of,

142
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,770
um,
what would you call them?

143
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,740
Um,
well we could start with charlatans.

144
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:31,460
That's a good one.

145
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,910
So pseudo intellectual would be good.
Resentful would be another.

146
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:36,830
And then I would also consider them 
highly,

147
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,083
they're highly deceptive in their 
intellectual strategies because almost 

148
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:42,680
all of them were Marxists student 
intellectuals.

149
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:45,650
And they knew by the time the Gulag 
archipelago came out.

150
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,000
And even before that,
that the,

151
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,960
the,
the,

152
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,190
the nightmares of the Soviet Union and 
Maoist China were of such magnitude that

153
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:53,024
they had completely invalidated any 
claim to ethical justification that the 

154
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:58,690
fundamental Marxist doctrines had ever 
managed to manage,

155
00:08:58,691 --> 00:09:00,900
to mount accessed.
And so it's an,

156
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,970
it's a no go zone as far as I'm 
concerned.

157
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:06,360
Intellectually the game's over.
We've already figured out that there are

158
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:07,194
finite constraints on interpretation and
we also understand why those exist and 

159
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:11,544
how they evolved in from,
from the perspective of of political 

160
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,513
argumentation.
There's absolutely no excuse whatsoever 

161
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:21,120
in the 21st century to put forth Marxist
doctrines as if they're the,

162
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:25,680
the bomb that's needed by the compassion
to then buy the bomb that's administered

163
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:27,930
by the Compassionate to the downtrodden.
Sorry,

164
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,550
tried that.
Didn't work.

165
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,060
We got 100 million corpses to prove it.
And that's plenty for me.

166
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:33,894
And if it's not enough for you,
well then you should do some serious 

167
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:39,240
thinking either about your historical 
knowledge or about your moral character.

168
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,433
So that's the first.

169
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,620
Thanks.

170
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,993
Okay,
so the next thing is what to do about 

171
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:54,944
it.
And I think I thought about a lot of 

172
00:09:56,391 --> 00:09:57,224
things,
but what might be done about it apart 

173
00:09:58,251 --> 00:10:01,100
from just talking about it,
which seems to be reasonably effective,

174
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:01,934
but um,
I thought for awhile that it would be 

175
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:06,140
useful for the,
for the,

176
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,281
for,
for,

177
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:09,020
for,
for the political systems,

178
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,720
people who are running the political 
systems to consider doing something like

179
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:12,554
cutting the funding of universities by 
25% and letting them fight over the 

180
00:10:15,111 --> 00:10:17,270
remains and hopefully what that would 
mean,

181
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,513
hopefully that would mean that the 
pseudo disciplines such as women's 

182
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:26,784
studies,
which never had a methodology to 

183
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,170
methodology that was credible to begin 
with.

184
00:10:31,171 --> 00:10:34,560
And I would put in the same 
classification all the ethnic and racial

185
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:37,800
studies groups that are popping up on 
campuses like mad under the guise of,

186
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,330
of,
of true disciplines,

187
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,400
which the,
not in any sense of the imagination,

188
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,593
but also or any sets of the word,
but also increasingly the social 

189
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:46,254
sciences and the general humanities that
have been corrupted quite terribly by 

190
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:50,310
the postmodern doctrines.
I thought,

191
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,173
well maybe it would be good to see if 
the funding could be cut for them 

192
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,533
because,
because there's no reason that the 

193
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,560
public at large should be funding a 
fifth column whose aim is to disrupt the

194
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:02,394
fundamental structures of Western 
civilization with tax money that's 

195
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:06,750
devoted to supporting people while 
they're doing it.

196
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,100
No,
I'd

197
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,933
like to think about that.
It'd be nice if that was a paranoid 

198
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:23,620
delusion and of course when I first 
started talking about this,

199
00:11:23,621 --> 00:11:24,454
the first thing that people thought and 
quite rightly was who the hell is this 

200
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:30,010
crazy professor and how many things 
might there be wrong with him?

201
00:11:30,011 --> 00:11:30,844
Which is exactly,
which is exactly what you should think 

202
00:11:32,771 --> 00:11:34,420
when someone stands up and says,
Hey,

203
00:11:34,421 --> 00:11:35,254
you know this system that you guys all 
think is going really well and that's 

204
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:40,630
been going wrong well for decades,
there's something seriously rotten about

205
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:42,070
it that you should be paying attention 
to.

206
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,010
The first thing you should think of is,
well,

207
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,863
what makes you think you're not insane?
And because that is the right that is 

208
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:50,140
the right answer under those 
circumstances.

209
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:52,230
But it turned out,
at least as far as I can tell,

210
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,400
that I'm not actually,
and that the things that,

211
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,740
and if the things that I were pointing 
out,

212
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:59,980
we're actually factual and what happened
in Canada at least,

213
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:01,810
and I would say to some degree around 
the world,

214
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:02,644
was that as journalists who actually 
happened to be concerned about free 

215
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:06,460
speech,
generally speaking,

216
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:07,294
started to look into the claims that I 
was making about such things as the 

217
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:10,444
legislative policies surrounding bill c 
16 they realized that I was actually 

218
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:14,554
just reading what was written on the 
page and understanding it instead of 

219
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,570
trying to blow something out of 
proportion,

220
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:22,750
which I had absolutely no motivation 
whatsoever to do.

221
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:23,861
But then,
you know,

222
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:25,870
I thought,
I thought,

223
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,370
um,
no,

224
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,204
you can't have political interference 
with the universities because what 

225
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:32,140
happens is that,
you know,

226
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:32,974
you think what happens is that if you 
arm the politicians so that they can 

227
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:38,380
start telling the universities what they
can and cannot teach,

228
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:39,214
even with regards to funding is then 
that goes seriously sideways very 

229
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:42,694
rapidly.
And you don't end up with a result that 

230
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:45,850
you wanted.
Do you end up with some other result?

231
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,350
Because you know how it is when you 
allow one organization to interfere with

232
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:51,184
the autonomous function of another is 
that it isn't the people that you want 

233
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:56,830
to do with the regulating that end up 
doing the regulating and the things that

234
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:59,560
you end up getting regulated aren't the 
things that you want to stop.

235
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:00,394
So that's not a good idea.
So I think I have a better idea and I 

236
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:08,551
think better idea is that the postmodern
or should be starved at their source.

237
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,490
And,
and I,

238
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,343
I don't use that terminology lightly.
I think that what needs to happen is 

239
00:13:14,321 --> 00:13:17,500
that freshmen and second year university
students and,

240
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,393
and students coming into university from
high school and need to be educated 

241
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:22,144
about the postmodern cult and they need 
to be encouraged to not take the 

242
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:26,380
courses,
to just drop the courses,

243
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:29,890
to just stay the hell away from them.
And the humanities enrollments have been

244
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:33,520
declining precipitously since the 1960s 
and a big part of that is that,

245
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,743
you know,
why in the world would you go as a half 

246
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:39,930
confused high school student into 
university and get whatever shreds of,

247
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,003
of culture that you're still clinging to
to keep your poor head above water in 

248
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:45,820
the sea of chaos that threatens to 
surround you,

249
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,713
taken away by your professors.
So you're stripped bare of anything but 

250
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:50,224
some vague sense that maybe you're a 
horrible racist unconsciously in some 

251
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:56,110
manner that you can't detect and then be
left with nothing that,

252
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:56,944
that for your,
for your hundred thousand dollar 

253
00:13:58,211 --> 00:14:00,160
investment in your bloody student loan.

254
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,900
So people are smart enough maybe not to 
continue to enroll in that sort of thing

255
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:05,734
over time.
And the humanities have been being 

256
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:09,430
decimated since the 1960s as a 
consequence.

257
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,740
But it's time for that process to 
accelerate.

258
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:14,110
And so here's something cool that 
happened this week,

259
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:15,650
I think.
Um,

260
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,073
I decided a couple of weeks ago to make 
a postmodern lexicon and I started 

261
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,423
analyzing word use in,
I was gathering abstracts from this 

262
00:14:24,191 --> 00:14:26,410
twitter site called new real peer 
review,

263
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:28,630
which is something that the 
postmodernists really hate

264
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,510
because of course what new real peer 
reviewed does this take actual published

265
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:38,440
abstracts from postmodern humanities 
journals,

266
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:39,274
which by the way have a zero citation 
rate of 80% and merely and merely 

267
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:44,434
republish them and the abstracts are so 
reprehensible and so incoherent and so 

268
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,163
cult like an ideologically addled that 
the people who wrote them get irritated 

269
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,910
when other people read them.

270
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,950
I know which is,
which is a good,

271
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,040
because the original,
the real peer review,

272
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,880
which was the first one was shut down by
people who are irritated that the people

273
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:05,714
who ran the twitter site had the 
unmitigated gall to actually publicize 

274
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,230
writing that was written to be 
publicized.

275
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:13,064
It was like the only situation I've ever
seen were authors were actually 

276
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:19,490
embarrassed that someone did what they 
could to publicize what they'd written.

277
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,743
Anyways,
new real peer review picked up where 

278
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:22,844
they stopped and has been publishing 
abstracts like mad from these crazy 

279
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:27,270
postmodern journals.
Uh,

280
00:15:27,271 --> 00:15:28,104
what's your journal is only a name.
And so I started to pull out key key 

281
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,053
words were,
I'll tell you a little bit about that 

282
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:34,340
game in a minute.
Um,

283
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,100
I started to pull out key words that 
were emblematic of the,

284
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,770
let's call it the postmodern cult.
And then I thought,

285
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:44,090
I generated questionnaire that that 
parents of university students and,

286
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,013
and late stage high school students and 
freshman in university and maybe second 

287
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:49,004
year students could use as a guideline 
so they could look at the course 

288
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:56,390
descriptions and checkoff word frequency
from the postmodern list and decide that

289
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:57,224
if the course was part of the postmodern
cult that they should maybe just not 

290
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:00,560
take it.

291
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,950
But then I got um,
a real interesting email from a guy,

292
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,220
I won't tell you his name,
but who's a computer programmer.

293
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:10,370
And he put together an AI system to 
parse apart postmodern,

294
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,563
the postmodern lexicon automatically.
And he set up a website now where 

295
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:19,031
students can feed in course descriptions
of any sort and it will spit out whether

296
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,440
or not they're postmodern and he's,

297
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,800
we're developing.
So the point is to get the,

298
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,640
to get the program up to the point where
it can automatically distinguish between

299
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:37,474
postmodern and non postmodern content.
And then students will be able to cut 

300
00:16:40,661 --> 00:16:41,494
and paste a course description and,
and paste it into the analysis box on 

301
00:16:44,861 --> 00:16:45,694
this website along with the professor's 
name and the course's name and the 

302
00:16:48,581 --> 00:16:49,414
discipline and the university.
And so we should be able to produce a 

303
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:52,744
listing of every university in every 
course that people are willing to 

304
00:16:55,571 --> 00:16:59,800
participate in analyzing across North 
America and set up a list of courses and

305
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:02,020
professors and disciplines that should 
be avoided.

306
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,233
And,
and so maybe we can start them out at 

307
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:04,960
[inaudible]

308
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,310
source and that's what should happen.

309
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,853
So it has,
it has to be bottom up as far as I can 

310
00:17:17,381 --> 00:17:20,590
tell for this to come to an end.
And it should come to an end because the

311
00:17:20,591 --> 00:17:23,470
postmodern neo Marxist doctrine is 
nothing but a cult,

312
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,363
except that it's the sort of cult that 
doesn't have enough economic sense to 

313
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:29,920
run itself out of profit.
So not only is it a cult,

314
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:31,420
it's a failed cult,
and if it was so,

315
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:32,254
it's a cult that has to be subsidized by
the public purse in order to exist at 

316
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:35,734
all.
So that's like you'll have some pretty 

317
00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:39,610
damn pathetic cult because normally if 
you're a decent cult leader,

318
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:42,160
you can at least figure out a way to 
pick the pockets of your,

319
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,500
of your victims in a manner that 
enriches you.

320
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,800
So I can't even manage to get that 
right,

321
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:48,634
which I think accounts for their 
anticapitalist biased because they 

322
00:17:51,031 --> 00:17:51,864
haven't been able to transform their 
radiological doctrine into some way of 

323
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:56,460
making themselves spontaneously rich.

324
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,833
Although it certainly seems to have done
a great job of late ladling students 

325
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:01,464
with observed levels of student loans in
the United States is exactly the point 

326
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:05,094
in their life where they should be free 
to make entrepreneurial decisions and 

327
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:09,480
take some risks,
which is also something that I regard as

328
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:10,314
absolutely reprehensible.
So universities have figured out how to 

329
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:13,884
conspire in some sense to pick the 
future pockets of the students that 

330
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:19,620
they're purporting to,
to educate.

331
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:21,700
And they're not educating them.
They're indoctrinating them,

332
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:24,480
they're not teaching them how to speak,
they're not teaching them how to debate.

333
00:18:24,481 --> 00:18:25,314
They're not teaching them how to write.
They're not introducing them to the 

334
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:29,910
classical wisdom of the western Judeo 
Christian tradition.

335
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,280
And that's an absent.
That's absolutely appalling.

336
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:34,770
Cause that's what the bloody institution
was there for to begin with.

337
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:35,790
And that's what it's supposed to be.

338
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:48,890
Okay.

339
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,640
Yeah.
So what else do I have to tell you about

340
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:53,474
that?

341
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,093
Yeah.

342
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,250
Oh yes.
I just have one more thing.

343
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:03,970
I guess that one of the things that I'm 
quite was quite curious about was,

344
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,833
um,

345
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,780
okay,

346
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,613
I'll tell you about two things.
One of the things I was quite curious 

347
00:19:08,331 --> 00:19:09,164
about is the postmodern say neo Marxists
insistence that the only true human 

348
00:19:13,281 --> 00:19:14,114
motivation is power.
Now I've been thinking about that in a 

349
00:19:16,011 --> 00:19:16,844
couple of ways.
I think that was actually Marxist 

350
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,463
sleight of hand at the end of the 1960s 
because the original Marxist 

351
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:26,360
revolutionary doctrine was that Western 
society,

352
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:29,630
let's say capitalist society.
But you can think about it more broadly.

353
00:19:29,631 --> 00:19:30,464
A society in general,
it's basically best conceptualized as a 

354
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,793
zero sum zero sum game fought to the 
death between the oppressors and the 

355
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:41,180
oppressed and be the proletariat and the
bourgeoisie let's say.

356
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,014
And you know,
as we as we know playing that game in 

357
00:19:43,971 --> 00:19:45,860
places like Soviet Union and mouse 
charring,

358
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,690
it didn't work out so well for every one
sold.

359
00:19:47,691 --> 00:19:50,330
There were seem to be a fundamental flaw
in the conceptualization.

360
00:19:50,331 --> 00:19:52,430
Although people could always excuse that
by saying,

361
00:19:52,431 --> 00:19:53,264
well that's not real communism,
which is the sort of statement that 

362
00:19:55,371 --> 00:19:58,320
should immediately get you punched in 
the nose hard enough to knock you out

363
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,273
far as I'm concerned.

364
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,950
So because the statement like that 
reveals only one thing,

365
00:20:07,951 --> 00:20:08,784
and what it reveals is that if you had 
been fortunate enough to be in the 

366
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:11,634
position,
the position of Joseph's tell him that 

367
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:13,674
you wouldn't have been quite the 
murderous monster that he was because 

368
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:16,254
your moral character is such that you 
wouldn't have been swayed by access to 

369
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:20,940
that kind of extreme power.
And if you're,

370
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:21,983
if you dare to make that claim,
then there's some things about yourself 

371
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,940
and humanity that you should learn and 
you should learn them rapidly before you

372
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:30,240
pose more of a danger to yourself then 
and others then you already post.

373
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,910
So,
so then,

374
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:37,860
so part of it is the postmodernist 
turned the Marxist emphasis on economics

375
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,130
into an emphasis on power in the 1970 
[inaudible].

376
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,003
And I think they did that as a form of 
sleight of hand because by the late 

377
00:20:43,471 --> 00:20:44,304
1960s and early 1970s it was obvious 
even to people as intransigent as 

378
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:48,964
someone as Saint John Paul Sartre,
which one who refused to denounce the 

379
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:55,570
communist party until that late in the,
in that progression of the 20th century,

380
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,490
it became obvious even to people like 
that,

381
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:58,324
that there was just no way that you 
could maintain your intellectual and 

382
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:04,720
moral credibility and remain a supporter
of standard communist doctrine.

383
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,780
And also it seemed to be the case that 
strangely enough,

384
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:08,614
contrary to Marxists prediction,
that the working class in the West was 

385
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,450
getting richer and richer than people 
had ever got in history,

386
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:16,150
rather than being increasingly 
downtrodden by the brute.

387
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,440
He'll of the,
of the,

388
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:18,274
of the corporate and capitalist elite.
So it was not a revolution that was 

389
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:24,640
particularly easy to sell.
Part of the sleight of hand was,

390
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,770
oh,
it's not about economic power,

391
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,700
it's about oppression and oppressed and 
oppressor on a broader sense.

392
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:33,580
And that's where we got the 
transformation into identity politics,

393
00:21:33,581 --> 00:21:37,210
which is just the Marxist oppressor,
oppressed doctrine.

394
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:38,044
Under a new guys and I think it's really
tremendously reprehensible for people 

395
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:42,484
to,
to be conducting themselves 

396
00:21:44,111 --> 00:21:44,944
intellectually in a manner that insists 
that the most important element of any 

397
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:52,360
student or any person for that matter is
whatever racial,

398
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:55,840
gender and sex identity happens to be 
flavor of the month.

399
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,673
And I think the problem with that 
fundamentally is first of all that that 

400
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:00,964
those categories systems are 
extraordinarily loose and there 

401
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,990
indefinitely multiply bubble,
you know,

402
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,060
because if you take any given 
individual,

403
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:09,220
there's probably,
well it's the postmodern problem.

404
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:10,240
Ha Ha.
There we go.

405
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,283
It's the postmodern problem that there's
almost an infinite number of ways to 

406
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:14,194
categories any given individual.
So how the hell you figure out which 

407
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:19,960
group they belong to.
And that's actually a major problem.

408
00:22:19,961 --> 00:22:23,200
Like if you're one eighth black,
what does that make you exactly?

409
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,880
Are you black?
Are you white?

410
00:22:24,881 --> 00:22:26,620
Are you oppressed?
Are you oppressor?

411
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,030
Are you,
are you,

412
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,780
let's see,
one half is oppressed as someone who's a

413
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,613
quarter black.
Does it work out arithmetically that 

414
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:34,301
way?
Hey,

415
00:22:34,301 --> 00:22:36,210
I'm dead serious about this man.
If,

416
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,990
if we're going to play this sort of 
game,

417
00:22:37,991 --> 00:22:40,180
that's exactly the question that has to 
be asked,

418
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:41,680
right,
and then how do you,

419
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:44,680
how do you multiply up you're oppressed 
identities and then again,

420
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:45,514
who decides who gets to decide exactly 
which identity you should manifest and 

421
00:22:48,461 --> 00:22:49,294
then how do we rank order those 
identities and then how do we equate 

422
00:22:51,611 --> 00:22:52,444
between them and what measurement 
techniques do we use to determine who's 

423
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,013
who's oppressed and who isn't and how do
we assess equality and on what 

424
00:22:58,661 --> 00:22:59,494
dimensions are we going to assess 
equality and who's going to enforce it 

425
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:03,220
and who's going to make the decisions?

426
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:03,821
It's like,
oh,

427
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:05,530
well,
we'll figure that out as we go along.

428
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:06,281
It's like,
yeah,

429
00:23:06,281 --> 00:23:08,440
we certainly will and the results won't 
be pretty.

430
00:23:08,441 --> 00:23:09,274
I can tell you that because,
because the problem is actually 

431
00:23:11,321 --> 00:23:13,690
unsolvable,
all it'll mean is that those,

432
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,553
those categories will be made at the 
whim of the people who are making the 

433
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:18,004
categories and since as we know,
the only thing they believe in power is 

434
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:22,324
power.
That the only thing they believe in his 

435
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:24,874
power is that you can be absolutely sure
that they will have absolutely no 

436
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:28,204
hesitancy whatsoever to use power in the
seeking of their aims and I think the 

437
00:23:31,991 --> 00:23:32,824
other reason that all of the 
postmodernist new Marxists ever do is 

438
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:35,974
talk about power is because they want to
justify their use of power to get 

439
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:39,850
exactly what they want when they want 
it.

440
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,650
There's nothing but power.
It's like,

441
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,510
all right,
if there's nothing but power,

442
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:46,290
that means we're at more power and that 
is,

443
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,510
that's the claim that you make.

444
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,343
Then you can justify the use of power 
because there isn't anything else to 

445
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,490
turn to.
There's no logic,

446
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:54,260
there's no dialogue,
there's no consensus,

447
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:56,600
there's no discussion between well 
meaning people,

448
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,643
there's nothing but divisions between 
power groups and identity groups and 

449
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,600
hobbsy in state of war between all of 
us.

450
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,930
Well,
when I look at people aiming at that,

451
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,773
they're not then my proclivity as a 
psychoanalyst just to think that that's 

452
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:12,410
exactly what they want and to divide us 
off all by race and ethnicity and sexual

453
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:13,244
identity and sexual preference and 
sexual expression and gender identity 

454
00:24:16,491 --> 00:24:17,324
and all of these multiplying forces of,
of group identities seems to be nothing 

455
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:24,440
but an invitation to chaos.
And that's exactly what I see looming.

456
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,543
And it needs to come to a stop and it 
needs to come to a stop as fast as 

457
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:29,870
possible.
And one way of doing that is to stop the

458
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:33,740
universities from continuing to 
indoctrinate young people who really,

459
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:36,350
at least two at the beginning,
don't know any better into play in these

460
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,184
absolutely insane.
And I would say bordering on murderous 

461
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:42,650
intellectual games.
And so,

462
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,860
so then I'm going to set up this website
and maybe some other wasn't slight it.

463
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,233
And I'm going to do a series of videos 
for young university students and for 

464
00:25:04,031 --> 00:25:04,864
high school students.
And I'm going to tell them that perhaps 

465
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:09,190
they don't need to go to university to 
be indoctrinated.

466
00:25:09,191 --> 00:25:11,020
Perhaps they could go to university to 
learn.

467
00:25:11,021 --> 00:25:11,854
And if they want to know the difference 
between an educator and someone who's 

468
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:18,310
merely interested in indoctrination and 
the production of the next generation of

469
00:25:18,311 --> 00:25:21,620
pathetic wining radicals,
then they can use the,

470
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,283
then they can use the website to 
distinguish between people who are 

471
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:26,314
credible and people who aren't.
And maybe we can drop the damn 

472
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:28,924
enrollment in those horrible courses by 
75% over the next three years and just 

473
00:25:31,991 --> 00:25:33,010
stop it in its tracks.

474
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,360
So anyways,
that's a part of the plan.

475
00:25:51,361 --> 00:25:52,194
And,
and,

476
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:55,443
and I think it's,
I think it's something that's actually 

477
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:57,603
implementable.
These things can turn around fast and 

478
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,473
one of the ways that they'll turn around
is that if people just stop taking the 

479
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:04,294
courses.
And so what people need to do in order 

480
00:26:06,881 --> 00:26:11,881
to know that they should stop taking the
courses is to know that these is to know

481
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,010
what it is that these courses are aiming
at.

482
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,630
So that needs to be explained.
Then they need to know what language the

483
00:26:19,631 --> 00:26:23,680
people who teach these courses are using
in order to fulfill those aims.

484
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,770
Then they need to know how to identify 
the courses.

485
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,770
Then they need to know that it's in 
their best interest.

486
00:26:29,771 --> 00:26:30,604
Both I would say spiritually and 
economically to avoid those courses and 

487
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,134
those disciplines like the plague.
And then maybe we can get the 

488
00:26:37,211 --> 00:26:38,044
disciplines that have become entirely 
corrupt and the ones that started that 

489
00:26:42,131 --> 00:26:42,964
way to put themselves back together 
before they run themselves out of 

490
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:47,490
existence completely.

491
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,323
And I might as well name a few of the 
disciplines that I think are 

492
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,260
particularly reprehensible to begin 
with.

493
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,423
I'm obviously,
I'm painting this with a very broad 

494
00:26:54,661 --> 00:26:55,494
brush and I'm not making the claim that 
every single person who engages in 

495
00:26:58,531 --> 00:26:59,364
activity within all of these disciplines
has been corrupted beyond comprehension 

496
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:05,970
by the postmodernist neo Marxists.
But it's close enough.

497
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,730
First pass approximation.
So,

498
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,170
um,
as I said already,

499
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:13,470
women's studies and all the ethnic 
studies in racial studies groups mad,

500
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,660
those things have to go in that faster 
they go,

501
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:20,661
the better they should never be.
It would have been better had they never

502
00:27:26,031 --> 00:27:27,590
been part of the university to begin 
with.

503
00:27:27,591 --> 00:27:30,950
As far as I can tell a sociology that's 
corrupt,

504
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,650
anthropology,
anthropology,

505
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:37,110
that's corrupt English literature that's
corrupt.

506
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,163
Um,
maybe the worst offender or the 

507
00:27:39,751 --> 00:27:41,820
faculties of education.
And I would say,

508
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,583
I read the recent poll,
I read the recent policy documents have 

509
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:53,300
the um,
elementary teachers,

510
00:27:53,301 --> 00:27:55,340
Federation of Ontario,
and I can tell you,

511
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,110
you can go read it.
It's right on your website.

512
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,450
Is that their plan?
And they just say it,

513
00:27:59,451 --> 00:28:01,820
I'm not making this up.
You don't need any inferences.

514
00:28:01,821 --> 00:28:02,654
There's,
there's nothing implicit about it is to 

515
00:28:04,281 --> 00:28:05,114
reorganize the curriculums from 
kindergarten to grade eight so that 

516
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,233
children are taught to be social justice
warriors from the moment they step foot 

517
00:28:10,701 --> 00:28:13,670
in the public education system.
That's exactly what they're doing.

518
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,420
They're making that,
they're making this look.

519
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,510
I mean we have social justice tribunals 
in Ontario.

520
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,553
Okay.
That's not subtle in case you didn't 

521
00:28:22,881 --> 00:28:26,150
notice to name them social justice 
tribunals,

522
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,270
that's not subtle.
And so you see the same sort of language

523
00:28:29,271 --> 00:28:30,081
in the ETF.
Oh,

524
00:28:30,081 --> 00:28:33,080
documents is that social justice is the 
right way to go.

525
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,913
The appropriate thing to do is to train 
children to follow precisely that 

526
00:28:36,231 --> 00:28:37,910
pathway.
And the best way to do it is to get them

527
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:39,480
as young as possible.
It's like,

528
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,420
and that's the faculties of education 
for you.

529
00:28:41,421 --> 00:28:44,660
And they're not producing people who are
interested in educating children at all.

530
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,973
And they're doing,
they're taking the easy route and what 

531
00:28:47,451 --> 00:28:48,284
they're doing is training people who who
can memorize and then spew forth a one 

532
00:28:52,341 --> 00:28:55,010
dimensional view of humanity and then 
have the gall,

533
00:28:55,011 --> 00:28:55,844
the unmitigated gall to presume that 
what they should be doing with children 

534
00:28:58,131 --> 00:28:58,964
is indoctrinating them into that 
particular line of thinking from his 

535
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,520
early an age as possible.
And so faculties of education,

536
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,890
they need to be fixed and they need to 
be fixed fast.

537
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,240
And then,
and this is where I'll stop,

538
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,550
one of the most shocking things I 
learned this year,

539
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:20,880
so I didn't really know this,
but I,

540
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,300
I didn't learn this till I went to 
Queens University cause I went to Queens

541
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,133
University.
I was invited there by a group of law 

542
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:26,724
students,
you know,

543
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:31,950
and I was their hope hypothetically to 
debate bill see 16 and the students went

544
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:34,800
to all the law professors and asked them
if they would debate me and none of them

545
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:36,600
would.
And I thought,

546
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,381
well,
I thought,

547
00:29:37,381 --> 00:29:39,180
yeah,
well that figures first of all,

548
00:29:39,181 --> 00:29:42,040
that's what I thought because,
well,

549
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:43,000
but it,
but then I thought,

550
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:43,834
Geez,
that's pretty absurd because I'm a 

551
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:46,450
psychology professor and you know,
law lawyers,

552
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,300
one thing lawyers are pretty good at is 
arguing if they're good lawyers.

553
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,323
I mean that in a complementary manner.
I mean that's what you learned to do 

554
00:29:52,781 --> 00:29:54,550
when you're a lawyer,
you learn to speak,

555
00:29:54,551 --> 00:29:57,720
you learn to formulate an argument and 
you learn to forgive me,

556
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,073
formulate an argument on virtually any 
set of principles because you know 

557
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,160
you're acting as defense or you're 
acting as prosecution and you need to be

558
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:06,994
flexible on your feet and put forward 
the best possible argument given the 

559
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:10,900
facts at hand.

560
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,730
And they couldn't find anybody to debate
me.

561
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:13,564
So Bruce Party,
who's a professor there had to act as 

562
00:30:15,221 --> 00:30:17,110
devil's advocate,
which he did quite nicely,

563
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,770
but I thought that was pretty,
pretty appalling to say the least,

564
00:30:20,771 --> 00:30:25,250
that they were either so ideologically 
rigid that they wouldn't confront me on,

565
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,000
on their bloody territory.
It's like if,

566
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:29,080
uh,
if the NFL,

567
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:33,700
if a law professor from Queens wanted to
come and debate me about psychology,

568
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:34,534
hey,
there'd be no problem with that because 

569
00:30:35,381 --> 00:30:36,214
that after all is my field of expertise 
and the fact that a law professor 

570
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:41,620
wouldn't come forward and debate me on a
legal matter.

571
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:42,454
I thought it was just,
I didn't even know what to think about 

572
00:30:44,231 --> 00:30:46,300
that.
But one of the things I did learn,

573
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:47,134
and I've really learned this more,
is that law has actually become corrupt 

574
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,880
as well as a discipline.
And it's not so much,

575
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,920
I know a lot of lawyers and I've worked 
with a lot,

576
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:56,740
but most of them have been more on the 
corporate and business end of things.

577
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,080
And so,
but all the human rights law,

578
00:30:59,081 --> 00:30:59,914
all the law that doesn't seem to be 
attached in some sense to business 

579
00:31:02,981 --> 00:31:07,030
concerns has also become corrupt and 
social justice oriented beyond belief.

580
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,103
And the students had queens were 
complaining to me that they weren't 

581
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:10,864
lending any law in their courses.
All they were learning with social 

582
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:13,324
justice propaganda.
And so you bloody well better watch out 

583
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:15,904
for that.
I can tell you because the people who 

584
00:31:16,631 --> 00:31:17,464
make your legislation or lawyers and 
they're making plenty of legislation 

585
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:22,690
that is not in your best interest.
And even worse than that,

586
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,793
perhaps it's not even in the best 
interest of the people for whom the 

587
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:27,964
legislation purports to protect because 
the bloody legislation and the policies 

588
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:34,860
are so incoherent and so badly written 
like bill [inaudible].

589
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,913
Here's one of the things it did.
No one knows this and I can't believe 

590
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:38,884
they haven't noticed.

591
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:39,963
You know,
the strongest argument that gay people 

592
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:42,034
have had for the last 50 years for being
included in broader society and let's 

593
00:31:44,921 --> 00:31:48,040
say tolerated so to speak or welcomed 
for that matter,

594
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:50,950
is that it was a biological phenomenon.
You know,

595
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,900
and I'd say the evidence for that isn't 
overwhelming,

596
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:54,790
but it's,
it's certainly suggestive.

597
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:55,624
It's like bill see 16 is eradicated that
because it's predicated on the 

598
00:31:58,571 --> 00:32:01,120
presupposition that there's no 
relationship,

599
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:03,280
that the relationship between biological
sex,

600
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:05,050
gender identity,
gender expression,

601
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,340
and sexual proclivity is independent.
They blew out the structure that enabled

602
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:10,174
them to make the argument for including 
the written for pursuing the rights to 

603
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:14,500
begin with.
And so if I was a good,

604
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,363
hateful,
right wing radical and feeling rather 

605
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,360
anti in my orientation,
let's say,

606
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,980
I might say something like,
Oh,

607
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:23,050
I see.
It's just something you learned,

608
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:23,741
is it?
Well,

609
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:26,500
how bout you unlearn it?
And if it's just your whim,

610
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,480
well then why should I put up with it at
all?

611
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,240
And that's actually written into the 
damned legislation now.

612
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,263
So,
so watch the lawyers because they're 

613
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:38,200
being trained as social justice warriors
and they're producing incoherent bits of

614
00:32:38,201 --> 00:32:39,034
legislation that are going to produce a 
tremendous amount of problems as they 

615
00:32:41,421 --> 00:32:43,940
roll through the legal system.
So anyways,

616
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:46,550
in closing,
the closing is,

617
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,200
it's a war of ideas and it's an 
educational problem.

618
00:32:58,201 --> 00:33:01,140
And what we're going to try to do is to 
educate students well enough.

619
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,420
Well,
they're making their course decisions so

620
00:33:03,421 --> 00:33:04,254
that they can stop being indoctrinated 
by people who should have known better 

621
00:33:06,661 --> 00:33:07,494
than to do that to begin with.
And so that's the plan for the next 

622
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,070
couple of years,
and hopefully it will be effective.

623
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:12,330
So thank you.
