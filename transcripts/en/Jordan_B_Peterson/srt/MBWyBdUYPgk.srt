1
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,770
So we're going to discuss some very 
rough things today.

2
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,550
Maybe you're somewhat accustomed to that
already,

3
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:22,130
but this is particularly brutal.
I think,

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,620
um,
I'm going to tell it,

5
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:27,710
talk to you about a body of research 
that's been produced over about the last

6
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:31,550
10 years and I think it,
it's perhaps it's,

7
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,983
it's a body of research that might 
outline some of the most important 

8
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:37,100
things that psychologists have ever 
discovered.

9
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:39,830
It's really changed my view,
for example,

10
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:40,664
on what happened in Nazi Germany,
which we're going to talk about a lot 

11
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:45,770
today.
And you know,

12
00:00:45,771 --> 00:00:46,604
we've already talked a fair bit about 
the temperamental determinance of 

13
00:00:48,951 --> 00:00:50,120
political belief.
Right?

14
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:50,954
And I've made a case for you that people
who are liberal or leaning to the left 

15
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:56,803
tend to be high in trait,
openness and low in trait 

16
00:00:58,071 --> 00:01:00,980
conscientiousness,
especially orderliness and people on the

17
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:03,830
right tend to be low in openness and 
high in conscientiousness,

18
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,220
especially orderliness and the effect is
not trivial.

19
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,053
If you look at just voting behavior,
then you get the typical sort of effect 

20
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:14,570
sizes that are characteristic of 
personality research.

21
00:01:14,571 --> 00:01:15,351
Point two,
two,

22
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:16,640
point four,
something like that,

23
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:17,474
correlations.
But if you start to analyze people's 

24
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:22,580
political beliefs in detail,
so so you get your measurement up to the

25
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:24,800
point where it's nice and reliable and 
valid,

26
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,160
then temperament,
a accounts for substantial,

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,500
a substantially higher proportion of the
variance.

28
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:31,334
And so a lot of what people seem to do 
is one thing you could think of is that 

29
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,070
they,
they,

30
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,933
they,
they politicize their temperament by 

31
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,300
constructing post-hoc arguments about 
the way the world is.

32
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:48,410
But it's deeper than that you see,
because we already know that you have to

33
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:51,650
use filtering mechanisms in order to 
Orient Yourself in the world,

34
00:01:51,651 --> 00:01:52,484
right?
Because the world is just too 

35
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:56,990
complicated for you to Orient Yourself 
without using filtering mechanisms.

36
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,040
And the question is,
well,

37
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,220
what are the filtering mechanisms?
And to large degree,

38
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,063
they're temperamental proclivities 
because they set up your value 

39
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:05,750
structure,
for example.

40
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:06,584
And that sets up your perceptual frame.
And so what that means is that you 

41
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:14,240
screen the world at the level of the 
facts that display themselves to you.

42
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,320
Because you know,
you could say,

43
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:16,154
well,
you're a dispassionate observer of the 

44
00:02:18,351 --> 00:02:19,184
universe of facts and that you extract 
out the conclusions that are reasonable 

45
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:25,550
person would extract out from that body 
of facts,

46
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:26,384
but unfortunately that's not the case 
because your perceptions are biased by 

47
00:02:29,271 --> 00:02:31,520
your temperament and they have to be 
because,

48
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,160
well,
because you have to screen things and so

49
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,260
you screened things in accordance with 
your temperament,

50
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,330
you know,
you're oriented toward certain things in

51
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:40,040
the world.
Certain values for example,

52
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,143
and that's a perfectly.
That's perfectly reasonable because you 

53
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:44,444
can't do everything at once anyways,
so there's no reason for you not to be 

54
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:49,454
directional.

55
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,630
The question is what are the pathologies
associated with directionality?

56
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,810
Now conscientiousness is a very 
interesting.

57
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,463
I'm a trait relationship to that because
there are obvious benefits to being 

58
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:02,980
conscientious,
right?

59
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,400
I mean it's the best long term predictor
of job performance for example,

60
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,513
and all outlined some other data that 
might be more associated with 

61
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:15,850
industriousness than orderliness,
but there's utility orderliness as well,

62
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,800
and we'll cover that in detail today.
The question is,

63
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,553
no,
the issue is that you never get a 

64
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:26,770
benefit without a price and so you can 
see that with agreeableness.

65
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:27,604
If you're agreeable high in 
agreeableness than you're compassionate 

66
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:32,410
and polite and you're empathic and you 
can work well in teams,

67
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:33,244
but the price you pay for that is that 
you don't negotiate very well on your 

68
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:37,720
own behalf and that you can be easily 
taken advantage of,

69
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:39,640
and then if you're very low in 
agreeableness,

70
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:44,641
well then you're more competitive and 
more out to win,

71
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:45,664
I would say,
but the price you pay for that is that 

72
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:47,494
if you become too disagreeable,
then you're likely to be sufficiently 

73
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,510
antisocial,
let's say,

74
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:56,890
so that you might end up in prison so 
you don't get a cost without a benefit.

75
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,820
You don't get a benefit without a cost.
So then the question might be,

76
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:03,220
well,
what's up with conscientiousness?

77
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:04,054
Because it seems all things considered 
that it would be a good thing to be 

78
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:07,234
conscientious.
Now I can think of some exceptions to 

79
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:12,610
that.
So conscientious people are dutiful,

80
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,500
industrious,
orderly,

81
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,393
that sort of thing,
and they tend to sacrifice the present 

82
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:21,360
for the future and that's a good thing.
So you,

83
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,710
you save up,
let's say you save up wealth,

84
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,990
you save up labor and effort for the 
future,

85
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,080
you know,
don't live for today,

86
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,880
don't be impulsive,
work hard and all that.

87
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:35,650
That will accrue.
Use success over the long run.

88
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,873
The downside of that is
the long run has to be stable in order 

89
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:41,614
for that to be a reasonable strategy and
so conscientiousness is not a good 

90
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,113
strategy,
at least under some conditions in 

91
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:52,000
situations that are radically unstable 
because in situations that are radically

92
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:52,834
unstable,
you might as well get what you can now 

93
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,080
or that's one way of looking at it.

94
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,913
Anyways.
The other thing about being 

95
00:04:57,671 --> 00:04:59,770
conscientious,
if you store up wealth,

96
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,633
say as a consequence of hard work,
then that can make you targets for 

97
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:04,840
people who would like to come and take 
your wealth.

98
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:05,674
And so it's also one of the things that 
happened to many people in the 20th 

99
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:11,230
century,
most recently in in Venezuela,

100
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,140
is that let's say you're conscientious 
and you save money.

101
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,873
Well,
what happens in that period of 

102
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:18,640
hyperinflation while your money is wiped
out,

103
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,550
and so you know,
this happened to Germany,

104
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,660
say the 19 twenties and you got to 
understand what hyperinflation does to a

105
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,503
society because
what hyperinflation does is destroy the 

106
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:29,944
people who worked hardest to construct 
the society because they're the people 

107
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:36,220
who've been prudent and careful and 
sacrificed and so forth.

108
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,830
And then when a period of high inflation
comes along,

109
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,050
poof,
everything they have disappears.

110
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,000
Not happened in Germany during the 19 
twenties.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,290
Now there was a bunch of reasons for 
that.

112
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:47,440
But so Germany was very unstable in the 
19 twenties,

113
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:49,900
right?
Because of the war had just ended.

114
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,160
They had been subjected to the 
Versailles Treaty,

115
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,650
which was a very punitive treaty aimed 
against Germany.

116
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,480
It's not like the allies had lacked 
reasons to impose a punitive treaty,

117
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:05,740
but nonetheless they did.
Germany lost a lot of territory,

118
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,830
including their industrial,
including their industrial areas.

119
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,653
Germany was flooded by men who were 
brutalized in the trenches in world war 

120
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,733
one.
You could hardly imagine how terrible 

121
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:22,361
trench warfare is and you can't imagine 
what you'd be like after a month of that

122
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,410
day of that,
let alone a couple of years of that,

123
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,753
and then Germany under a period of 
hyperinflation at the same time in the 

124
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,703
Soviet Union,
the the Communist Revolution had had 

125
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:37,390
been successful and so there was 
tremendous political upheaval in Germany

126
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,080
during the 19 twenties as well.

127
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,050
I want to just set the stage for that 
and so,

128
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,630
but the hyperinflation wiped out older 
people that were

129
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,083
prudent and saved and left them with a 
terrible sense that the entire system 

130
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:50,624
had betrayed them,
which is of course exactly what had 

131
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:53,000
happened.
So.

132
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,680
All right,
so anyways,

133
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,173
conscientiousness is a bit of a mystery.
Know we've looked at plasticity right 

134
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,140
already.
That's a combination of extraversion and

135
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:03,974
openness.
I just want to walk you through again 

136
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:07,220
where conscientiousness is located in 
the big five space.

137
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:08,054
So plasticity is a combination of 
extraversion and openness and then 

138
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:13,310
stability is a combination of 
conscientiousness,

139
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:14,144
emotional stability and agreeableness 
and conscientiousness is made out of 

140
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,550
industriousness and orderliness.
Now here's,

141
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,580
here's some markers for for 
conscientiousness.

142
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:23,414
So here's what you're like.
If you're ordering or if you're 

143
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:27,110
industrious,
you carry out your plans,

144
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,063
you don't waste time,
you don't find it difficult to get down 

145
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:30,650
to work.

146
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,380
You don't mess things up,
you finish what you start,

147
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,580
you put your mind on the task at hand,
you get things done quickly,

148
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,623
you know what you're doing,
you don't postpone decisions and you're 

149
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:41,234
not easily distracted.
That's what an industrious person is 

150
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:45,290
like.
We don't know anything about industrious

151
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,124
people.
We cannot figure out why they're 

152
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:47,924
industrious.
If you read the neuropsychological 

153
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,683
literature,
you might assume that people who have 

154
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,023
highly functioning prefrontal cortex is,
might be more conscientious because 

155
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:57,014
people associate the prefrontal cortex 
with such things as the capacity to 

156
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:03,310
plan.
The problem with that is that we've,

157
00:08:03,311 --> 00:08:04,144
for example,
tested now thousands of people using 

158
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:07,214
tests of dorsolateral prefrontal 
cognitive ability which are basically 

159
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,820
cognitive tests and as you know from 
being in this class,

160
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,313
if you take a battery of cognitive tests
and you subject them to a factor 

161
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:18,404
analysis,
you can extract out a first factor and 

162
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:20,594
that's fluid intelligence and the 
correlation between fluid intelligence 

163
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:25,100
and conscientiousness is zero.

164
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,473
Right?
So,

165
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,740
so that's,
that's very,

166
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:31,490
very strange because you would tend to 
think that people who were smarter might

167
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:33,410
be better at planning and maybe they 
are,

168
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:34,244
but they're not necessarily better at 
implementing and that we don't 

169
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:39,800
understand the difference between 
planning and implementation.

170
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,663
We don't know what that is.
You've got to think about it this way 

171
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:45,584
too though.
Just because you're better at planning 

172
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,793
wouldn't necessarily imply that you're 
better at implementing because actually 

173
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:56,171
one of the prerequisites for thinking 
abstractly is that can detach your plans

174
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:57,780
from your action,
right?

175
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,170
Because otherwise you just automatically
act out everything you planned,

176
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,920
but that is what people do.
They separate out their thinking so that

177
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:09,030
they can work in an abstract space 
that's divorced from their action and so

178
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:12,210
they can lay out multiple plans without 
necessarily acting them out,

179
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,313
but then that introduces the additional 
complication of having to implement and 

180
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,740
industrious people seem to be good at 
implementation,

181
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,420
but we don't know why.

182
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,463
We've done all sorts of laboratory 
studies trying to see if we could get 

183
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,633
some sort of laboratory task that 
industrious people would do better in 

184
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:31,560
the lab.
The non industrious people,

185
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,990
God,
you'd think that would be a snap snap.

186
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,413
We.
We probably tested 50 things and have 

187
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:37,914
never got anything.
Differences in language use is as close 

188
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:41,544
as we've got.
You can extract out estimates of 

189
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:44,784
people's conscientiousness or they're 
industrious does from the way they use 

190
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:48,204
language,
but that's not a lot different than 

191
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:50,880
using self report.
Personality scales.

192
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,860
It's different but it's not a lot 
different.

193
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,540
So we've done things,
for example,

194
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:59,370
like imagine we present people with a 
row of h's n's,

195
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,390
m's and use row after row of letters.
Small type.

196
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,630
You say go through and circle all the 
use.

197
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:07,763
Well,
obviously you would think that that 

198
00:10:08,971 --> 00:10:11,760
would be a task that would require 
diligence and industriousness.

199
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,070
You could time how long it took people 
to do it.

200
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,910
You could see how accurate they were.
Correlation with conscientiousness,

201
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,500
nothing,
zero.

202
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,300
It's an ICU task as it turns out,
and so the best we've been able to do so

203
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:27,720
far maybe with industriousness is,
and this is so vague,

204
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:28,554
it's embarrassing,
is that we think that may be 

205
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,350
industrious.
People find inactivity aversive,

206
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,430
so it did because they're not motivated 
by enthusiasm,

207
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:39,264
right?
For the task that would be an extrovert 

208
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:43,290
and they're not motivated by intrinsic 
interest in the task.

209
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,483
That would be someone who is open and 
they're not motivated by the desire to 

210
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:51,510
decrease anxiety or emotional pain 
because that would be someone who's high

211
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:52,580
in neuroticism.
Right,

212
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,423
and they're not motivated by the desire 
to foster affiliative relationships or 

213
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,480
to compete because that looks like it 
loads on it,

214
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,800
on agreeable.
This is something else.

215
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,130
It does a good job of predicting 
military prowess.

216
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:05,964
For example,
we tested a number of people who worked 

217
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,290
in the US military in a number of 
different places.

218
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,340
Conscientiousness was a deadly predictor
of of,

219
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,213
of ranking in military performance in 
schools like the US Naval Academy for 

220
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:21,180
example,
and also on on military basis themselves

221
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,253
and that kind of makes sense.
I mean the military is a conservative 

222
00:11:24,421 --> 00:11:25,254
place.
You'd expect people who are 

223
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,800
conscientious and dutiful to do better 
in a place like that,

224
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:31,470
but so they're good at.
They're good at implementation,

225
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:34,350
they're good at following orders,
they're good at doing their duty.

226
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,720
Now we're starting to understand a 
little bit about the value concerns that

227
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,913
conscientious people would have to,
and so let's go through orderliness so 

228
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:46,650
you can decide whether you're orderly or
disorderly.

229
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,070
Leave your belongings around that you're
disorderly.

230
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:51,900
Obviously if you do that like order 
well,

231
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:52,370
that's a.

232
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,220
that's a no brainer.
Keep things tidy.

233
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:56,530
Follow a schedule,
is bothered,

234
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,640
is bothered by messy people,
wants everything to be just right,

235
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,490
is bothered by disorder,
likes routine,

236
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,210
sees that rules are observed and wants 
every detail taken care of.

237
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,910
You can imagine all sorts of occupations
where that would be useful.

238
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:11,020
Accounting,
for example,

239
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,160
or there are people who go around and 
check,

240
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,293
you know,
natural gas fittings and that sort of 

241
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:16,804
thing by a checklist and you know,
you want someone like that every in any 

242
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:24,790
position where careful attention to 
detail is absolutely vital.

243
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,490
The question is,
as we said before,

244
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:29,140
what,
what's the potential downside?

245
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:32,590
So with industriousness we don't know 
anything about it.

246
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,250
Here's the problem with 
conscientiousness.

247
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,930
Okay.
Broadly speaking,

248
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,813
there's no theoretical bottle.
Nobody has any idea why people are 

249
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:45,010
conscientious except for the few things 
that I've told you,

250
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,173
there's no neuropsychological model 
because the prediction would be 

251
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:49,354
something like people who are higher in 
prefrontal cortical ability because 

252
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:54,880
that's associated with planning would be
more conscientious.

253
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,940
That's not true.
There's no psychological model.

254
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,053
That's partly because conscientiousness,
as a trait was extracted out of the 

255
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:07,270
linguistic pools that we described by 
factor analytic processes.

256
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:11,440
Nobody predicted that that would emerge 
as a fundamental trait.

257
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:14,110
It just came out of this statistics,
so there was no.

258
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,860
There's no model surrounding it really,
and there's no pharmacological model.

259
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:18,694
We don't know how to make people more 
conscientious with the possible 

260
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:24,130
exception of drugs like Ritalin,
amphetamines,

261
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:24,964
you know,
that that seemed to be able to make 

262
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:26,674
people focus in more and so maybe 
there's an association to some degree 

263
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:32,230
between conscientiousness and the 
ability to pay attention,

264
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:35,410
but when we've used attentional tasks in
the lab,

265
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,453
first of all,
they load on fluid intelligence and 

266
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:40,510
second they don't correlate with 
conscientiousness.

267
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,610
There was another dead end,
very,

268
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:43,444
very difficult to for.
It's a real mystery to me because we 

269
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:50,230
don't have that many good predictors of 
life outcome Iq.

270
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,090
That's a good one.
Conscientiousness.

271
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:53,110
That's a good one.
Well,

272
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:55,270
what's conscientiousness?
Well,

273
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,130
we don't know.
We don't know anything about it.

274
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,253
W W with the exception of the things I 
told you and I'm going to describe some 

275
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:02,890
of the other things that we found out 
more recently.

276
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,533
So.

277
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,733
Okay.
So what else is useful about 

278
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:10,810
conscientiousness?
Well,

279
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:13,960
it's strongly related to life 
satisfaction and happiness.

280
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:15,520
Actually,
if you look at the big five,

281
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,400
if you look at the traits that are most 
correlated within the big five,

282
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,830
conscientiousness and neuroticism are 
negatively correlated.

283
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,350
Make sure I got that right.
The more conscientious you are,

284
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:27,184
the less likely you are to suffer from 
anxiety and emotional pain and I think 

285
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:32,980
the reason for that,
but I don't know,

286
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,920
but I think the reason for that is that 
by being conscientious,

287
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,620
you stabilize your environment,
right?

288
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:40,330
Because everything becomes more 
predictable,

289
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:41,740
more scheduled,
more routine.

290
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,813
You're more likely to be successful,
so if things aren't going wrong around 

291
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:47,440
you all the time,
then you're going to be less anxious and

292
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:48,274
less emotional pain.
So I don't think that there's a direct 

293
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,740
relationship between being more 
conscientious and less neurotic,

294
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,783
but I think there's one that's mediated 
by the environment and this is very 

295
00:14:58,551 --> 00:14:59,384
interesting you see,
because you'll hear all sorts of social 

296
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:06,110
psychologists tell you and that 
conservatives are more likely to be high

297
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:06,890
in negative emotion.

298
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,810
They're more threat sensitive,
say the liberals,

299
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:12,680
but the weird thing about that is is 
that the conservatives are not higher in

300
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:14,270
neuroticism.
The liberals actually,

301
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:17,270
the contrary happens to be true.
The liberals have slightly more neurotic

302
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:18,104
than the Conservatives and so of 
conservatives are threat sensitive 

303
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:21,770
because that's supposed to be the 
theory.

304
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:22,903
Then why the hell don't they show up as 
being higher in trait neuroticism and 

305
00:15:25,431 --> 00:15:26,091
you could say,
well,

306
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:26,924
they're so effective at their 
conservatism that they've reduced their 

307
00:15:29,451 --> 00:15:30,284
neuroticism by organizing their 
environment and to some degree that's 

308
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:34,070
true,
but Jesus,

309
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:37,640
if your theory predicts one thing and 
the opposite happens to be true,

310
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:39,500
you can't just post hoc say,
well,

311
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:42,740
there's some other reasons we didn't pay
any attention to to account for that,

312
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,933
like it's really bothered me because it 
does seem to be the case that the 

313
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:48,494
political landscape is shaped to some 
degree by some sort of negative emotion 

314
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:52,874
that's broadcast at the people who were 
on the other side of the political 

315
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:55,754
spectrum,
but the evidence that it's anxiety 

316
00:15:57,621 --> 00:15:59,540
related seems to be very,
very thin.

317
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,860
So the question is,
well,

318
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:01,694
what else might there be so well?
Conscientiousness is related to 

319
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:06,494
depression and guilt.
There's a researcher named Faye Art who 

320
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,113
looked to show use a med analysis to 
show that conscientiousness was 

321
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:16,670
associated with specific emotions and 
overall negative emotion,

322
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,950
but was most strongly associated with 
guilt.

323
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,283
It was most.
It was negatively related to guilt 

324
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:22,364
experience,
but positively related to guilt 

325
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,703
proneness and so maybe guilt is the 
emotion that you feel when you don't do 

326
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:28,940
your duty.
Something like that,

327
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,490
and that's partly why we were thinking 
as well.

328
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,753
It's part of,
it's not exactly why we were thinking 

329
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:39,911
that conscientiousness is motivated by 
our inability to tolerate inactivity,

330
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,303
but it's.
It's a finding that's along the same 

331
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:48,380
sort of theoretical lays out the same 
sort of theoretical territory,

332
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,543
so you must know people.
Maybe the maybe the person is your 

333
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:53,270
mother or perhaps it's your father.

334
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,313
They come over to your place or you go 
over there and they're just working all 

335
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:57,740
the time.
They can't sit down and relax.

336
00:16:57,741 --> 00:17:00,070
They just work all the time and they say
it.

337
00:17:00,071 --> 00:17:02,750
They'll tell you if you ask them all,
I can't stand sitting around.

338
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,673
I have to be doing something and you can
imagine to how that might have been 

339
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,920
selected for across the evolutionary 
time span.

340
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:14,600
I mean if you're living in a situation 
where resources are somewhat limited,

341
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,720
like we pretty much all do,
you're going to want.

342
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,560
You're going to demand of the people 
around you that they at least pull their

343
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:23,450
fair share of the weight.
Right,

344
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,643
and so you could imagine that the people
who were likely to feel a negative 

345
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:33,170
emotion of some sort for not chipping in
and doing their share or more than their

346
00:17:33,171 --> 00:17:34,004
share,
which would be a neat way of indicating 

347
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:36,440
their value to the community.

348
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,543
We're more likely to be well less likely
to be less likely to be selected as 

349
00:17:41,571 --> 00:17:45,920
mates and also perhaps more likely to be
severely punished from time to time.

350
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,600
Now you might say,
well,

351
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:50,370
how do people get away with not 
conscientious then?

352
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,423
Well,
the answer to that would be there are 

353
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:53,934
other things that you can offer the 
community that are a value that aren't 

354
00:17:57,781 --> 00:18:01,380
associated with to fullness,
and I think comedians are a good example

355
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:02,214
of that.
I don't believe that comedians are 

356
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:06,570
particularly conscientious because it's 
not the kind of lifestyle you would pick

357
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:10,260
if you were a conscientious person or 
people who grow out on the road and play

358
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:11,490
music,
for example.

359
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,503
Because that's such an erratic lifestyle
and so unlikely to be stable across any 

360
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:17,214
reasonable amount of time,
so maybe you could be valuable to the 

361
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:23,850
community by being a music.
An extrovert would do that or or by,

362
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,780
by helping ensure success,
security and safety,

363
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:28,614
and maybe someone high in neuroticism 
would do that or maybe you would be 

364
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:35,130
useful because you're really good at 
developing affiliative relationships.

365
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,590
That would be someone who is agreeable 
or you're creative,

366
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,430
but the conscientious person 
demonstrates their value by working hard

367
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:42,264
and being beautiful and contributing to 
the broader community and and following 

368
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,570
rules and all that sort of thing,
and there may be other things they do as

369
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:49,404
well.
So now here's the downside to being 

370
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:56,670
conscientious.
If you're working in a big company,

371
00:18:56,671 --> 00:18:57,504
say and there's mass layoffs and you 
happen to be effected independently of 

372
00:19:00,211 --> 00:19:01,044
your work history,
the probability that you'll become 

373
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:03,624
depressed is quite a lot higher.
If you're conscientious and some of you 

374
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:10,740
may be conscientious people and you know
that if you fail at something or even if

375
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:12,270
you think you might be failing at 
something,

376
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,030
you're going to tear yourself apart.
You're going to find it,

377
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:17,670
you're going to blame yourself for it 
because conscientious people,

378
00:19:17,671 --> 00:19:20,550
especially orderly people are also 
judgmental,

379
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,480
right?

380
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,313
And so which is something the liberals 
always accused the conservatives of 

381
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:25,764
doing is being judgmental and laying 
down their value structure on 

382
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:30,150
everything.
But if you're conscientious,

383
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:30,984
you're going to tend to assume that if 
things aren't going well for you that 

384
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:34,734
it's your fault and that's you can 
understand why that might be a useful 

385
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:38,964
supposition when it is the case that 
there's something you could have done 

386
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:46,320
that would have stabilized you were or 
improved your chances,

387
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,350
and you can often think of something 
even if it's trivial,

388
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:54,351
but it's not so good when you happen to 
be caught up in waves of mass movement,

389
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,760
for example,
when you're laid off by a big company,

390
00:19:56,761 --> 00:19:57,594
that where the relationship between that
happening and your own work ethic is 

391
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:02,550
very,
very tenuous.

392
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,280
Nonetheless,
you'll still pull yourself apart.

393
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,383
So.

394
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,583
Alright,
so let's take a look at orderliness 

395
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,953
because we don't have much to say about 
industriousness because we don't know 

396
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:15,864
anything about industriousness,
but we're starting to understand a lot 

397
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:20,070
about orderliness and it's extremely 
interesting.

398
00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:23,490
So we we'd only managed to parse out 
orderliness,

399
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,473
roughly speaking,
only managed to parse out 

400
00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:27,354
conscientiousness into orderliness and 
industriousness over about the last 10 

401
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:31,560
years.
I mean,

402
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,830
people have had placed orderliness under
conscientiousness before that,

403
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:35,664
but psychometrically,
it's become with the big five aspect 

404
00:20:38,051 --> 00:20:38,884
scale,
it's become more straightforward to 

405
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:44,400
measure and so here's what we know about
orderliness so far.

406
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,500
It predicts conservatism along with low 
openness,

407
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,423
low openness is a better predictor of 
conservatism and high openness of 

408
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:52,324
liberalism than conscientiousness is,
but conscientiousness is a pretty good 

409
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:57,910
predictor and that's almost all 
orderliness.

410
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,300
It's also associated with disgust 
sensitivity.

411
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,553
Now that's a very cool thing.
So Jonathan Heit has done a lot of work 

412
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:06,934
on disgust sensitivity and so as a guy 
named Paul Rosen and I knew their 

413
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:12,990
research from really almost,
I guess it's almost 30 years ago now,

414
00:21:12,991 --> 00:21:15,730
and I thought they were really onto 
something back in the nineties.

415
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,940
I really thought that investigating 
discussed would be useful because no one

416
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:19,774
had ever really talked about it,
hadn't conceptualized it as a separate 

417
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:23,044
emotion system,
and we found that that disgust 

418
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:29,500
sensitivity is associated with 
orderliness,

419
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,830
with a preference for order and 
tradition and not with egalitarianism.

420
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,903
It's also associated orderliness with 
harsh judgments of moral transgression 

421
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,310
and,
and this is the kicker here.

422
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:42,460
I think it's associated with the 
function of something that psychologists

423
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:43,294
have started to describe as the 
behavioral immune system and so we're 

424
00:21:45,941 --> 00:21:46,774
going to talk about the behavioral 
immune system and then we're going to 

425
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:49,504
talk more speculatively.
I would say about the role that the 

426
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,374
behavioral immune system might play in 
political choice and also in political 

427
00:21:56,861 --> 00:22:00,070
pathology.
And I find this overwhelmingly shocking,

428
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,123
this body of data because it's opened up
a view for me of why people are 

429
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:08,850
prejudice that I had no idea existed and
it's.

430
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,893
It's make.
It actually makes prejudice a more 

431
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,020
terrifying thing.
I was terrified about prejudice before I

432
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:15,850
do any of this stuff I'm going to tell 
you about today,

433
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,070
but this makes it more terrifying 
because it.

434
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,250
It locks it so deeply into people you 
can't believe it,

435
00:22:21,251 --> 00:22:22,084
and the worst than that,
if you understand why it's locked so 

436
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:26,374
deeply into people,
you also understand why it emerged as a 

437
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:32,320
necessity and that's the terrifying 
thing now.

438
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:35,860
So we're stuck with that now and no one 
really knows what to do about it.

439
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:38,140
And so what?
We'll walk through this and you can tell

440
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:40,990
me what you think.
So what's the behavioral immune system?

441
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,400
All right?
According to the parasite,

442
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,323
stress hypothesis,
levels of parasitic infection within a 

443
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:54,520
region may drive variability at both 
individual and societal levels.

444
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,383
Okay,
so they're talking about individual 

445
00:22:56,801 --> 00:23:00,430
variability in political attitudes,
in personality traits,

446
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:04,000
both among individuals and both in the 
social world.

447
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,970
And so we'll outline that in some great 
detail.

448
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,553
The avoidance of death or disability 
through avoidance of infection is a 

449
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:15,490
major evolutionary driving force,
for example,

450
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:18,220
until times that are recent,
in evolutionary terms,

451
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,263
almost 50 percent of children failed to 
survive to reproductive age with the 

452
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:26,200
majority of deaths being due to 
infectious diseases.

453
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,153
Now we're less cognizant of that as 
modern people because of the invention 

454
00:23:31,871 --> 00:23:32,704
of antibiotics,
which we're currently in the process of 

455
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:39,160
destroying as rapidly as we possibly 
cat,

456
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,053
right?
Because they're given widescale to 

457
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:47,100
animals and to people too far too great 
a degree and all over the world.

458
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:51,080
We're generating new infectious diseases
that are resistant to antibiotics,

459
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:55,520
all known antibiotics and we don't have 
any new antibiotics in the pipeline,

460
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,620
so although we've had a 60,
70 year hiatus where infectious diseases

461
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:01,454
were well controlled,
they're back on the march again and for 

462
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:05,774
example,
there are multiple strains that have 

463
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:07,874
emerged of antibiotic resistant 
tuberculosis that can't be treated by 

464
00:24:11,331 --> 00:24:13,580
any known combination of antibiotics and
they will.

465
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,890
Those are actually 10.
This is a terrible thing.

466
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:16,724
They tend to be bred in hospitals and my
guess is if we did the epidemiology 

467
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:21,224
properly,
that hospitals kill more people than 

468
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:23,474
they save and the reason they do that is
because they bring people together who 

469
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:29,690
have diseases and they breed infectious 
disease of all sorts.

470
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:32,390
That's antibiotic resistant.
It's absolutely insane.

471
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:35,270
And here's another thing we do that's 
completely crazy.

472
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:39,440
So
if you bring cattle to a feed lot,

473
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,483
they're fed,
this is particularly the case in in the 

474
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:44,210
US,
but it's also the case in Ontario.

475
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,520
They're fattened up on corn and the 
reason they're fattened up on corn,

476
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,610
because corn is heavily subsidized as a 
crop,

477
00:24:52,611 --> 00:24:53,444
so it's damn near free.
That's why there's corn syrup in 

478
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:55,821
everything,
right?

479
00:24:55,821 --> 00:24:59,300
Because it's a very low cost,
very low cost source of calories,

480
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,640
and you might say,
well hooray.

481
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,840
You know,
a low cost source of calories.

482
00:25:02,841 --> 00:25:03,674
Isn't that wonderful?
Because that means that people don't 

483
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,000
have any who don't have any money,
get to eat and right,

484
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,863
fair enough.
But the subsidy is made corn so cheap 

485
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:11,624
that you can.
You can feed it to cows to fatten them 

486
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:14,174
up because they get quite fat fast.
They gave a lot of weight fast with 

487
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:17,024
corn.
The problem is cows can digest corn so 

488
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:22,280
it makes them sick or they digest it 
very badly.

489
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,440
It makes them sick.
They're not designed for it.

490
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:26,420
They're designed to eat grass,
not corn,

491
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,880
and so in order to stop the cows from 
dying,

492
00:25:28,881 --> 00:25:29,714
when you feed them corn,
you pump them full of antibiotics and 

493
00:25:31,911 --> 00:25:34,700
that's one of the things that's breeding
antibiotic resistance,

494
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,593
so it's not very smart,
but that's what we're doing and no one 

495
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:40,610
really notices and that's a very bad 
idea,

496
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,040
so you can be sure.

497
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,933
One of the things that you can be 
virtually certain of is that whatever 

498
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:48,170
you're worried about happening terribly 
in the future,

499
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,183
it will be something else that you're 
not worrying about that will actually 

500
00:25:51,321 --> 00:25:53,960
cause the problem,
and this could certainly be one of those

501
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:54,794
things.
Local parasite types and host defense 

502
00:25:57,231 --> 00:25:58,064
systems will typically typically be 
involved in a coal evolutionary arms 

503
00:26:01,971 --> 00:26:03,950
race,
and so at any given time,

504
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:08,930
a host's immunological defenses will be 
specialized to be most effective against

505
00:26:08,931 --> 00:26:12,710
local parasite species.
To the extent that a host defense system

506
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:13,544
is specialized locally,
contact with out groups will be 

507
00:26:17,061 --> 00:26:17,894
associated with an increased risk of 
exposure to infectious diseases against 

508
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:24,080
which there is no a priori immunity.
Okay.

509
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:28,550
I'm going to read that again because you
should think about it to the extent that

510
00:26:28,551 --> 00:26:29,384
a host defense system is specialized 
locally contact with out groups will be 

511
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:34,304
associated with an increased risk of 
exposure to infectious diseases against 

512
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:40,070
which there is no a priori immunity.

513
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,800
Black Plague Europe came in on ships,
right?

514
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:46,230
The Europeans started to spread out.
They came back with the ships.

515
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,030
The rats came off the ships,
poof.

516
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:53,010
Third of the European population died.
The relevant infection,

517
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:58,011
avoiding behaviors such as avoidance of 
strangers and high conscientiousness in,

518
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,753
for example,
food preparation are assumed to arise 

519
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:04,380
from the operation of a behavioral 
immune system.

520
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,573
The behavioral immune system comprises 
adaptive psychological response 

521
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:09,354
mechanisms that are sensitive to cues 
that might predict the presence of 

522
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:13,644
infectious pathogens and which respond 
with appropriate cognitive processing 

523
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:19,920
and affective reactions.
Such a system.

524
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,320
This is the next thing that you want to 
pay attention to.

525
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,580
Such a system is likely to be 
oversensitive.

526
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:31,140
The cost of a false positive,
avoiding non existent infection is small

527
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:34,470
relative to the possible cost catching 
an avoidable infection.

528
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,513
Okay,
so you're walking through the grass and 

529
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,340
your snake detectors go off.

530
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,940
They're full or the perifoveal of your 
eyes,

531
00:27:41,941 --> 00:27:42,990
the periphery,
periphery,

532
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,590
especially for the detection of things 
that might threaten you,

533
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,030
and so you could say,
well,

534
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,163
your snake,
you have snake detection systems in the 

535
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:51,534
periphery of your vision that are 
hypersensitive because if you see a 

536
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,730
stick and you think snake and you jump 
up in the air,

537
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:57,743
the cost is you jumped up in the air,
so who cares that you miss identified 

538
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:02,064
the snake,
but if there's a snake there and you 

539
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,100
don't see it and it bites you,
then you're dead.

540
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:10,320
So the logic is why not set the systems 
that protect you to be hypersensitive?

541
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:11,154
Because the cost of the hypersensitivity
is low compared to the cost of 

542
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,810
hyposensitivity,
right?

543
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,063
In social terms,
an important component of the parasite 

544
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:26,211
stress hypothesis is that high levels of
infection may lead to ethnocentrism,

545
00:28:27,091 --> 00:28:27,924
xenophobia,
distrust of different others and 

546
00:28:29,851 --> 00:28:30,684
conformity because such behaviors will 
reduce the likelihood of exposure to 

547
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:37,260
unfamiliar of infections to which 
immunity has not been developed.

548
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,243
Why is there strict sexual morality?
Because promiscuity is a prime vector 

549
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:45,510
for disease transmission.
That's one of the reasons

550
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,400
conservatism,
as the social immune system,

551
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:55,950
disgust is considered to be one of the 
basic human emotions defined by a strong

552
00:28:55,951 --> 00:29:00,090
revulsion and desire to withdraw from an
eliciting stimulus or event.

553
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,223
Physically.
Disgust is accompanied by a distinct 

554
00:29:03,181 --> 00:29:04,014
facial expression,
involve involving constriction of the 

555
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:07,104
oral and the nasal cavity,
so that's the disgust face which closes 

556
00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:12,300
up your nose and your mouth so that 
things can get in.

557
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,673
Evolutionary models of discussed 
proposed that this emotion evolved to 

558
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:16,734
help us avoid contaminated or harmful 
foods or other potential sources of 

559
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:20,904
disease such as sexual contact.
You know there's lots of psychoanalytic 

560
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,060
theories about sexual shame and sexual 
disgust,

561
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:30,330
but it's much more straightforward as 
far as I'm concerned,

562
00:29:30,331 --> 00:29:31,164
to view it as a biological battle.
There's approach systems and sexual 

563
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:35,904
arousal systems that are involved in 
moving you forward towards a sexual 

564
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:39,594
partner,
but there's disgust systems that guard 

565
00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:42,064
you against it and those two things are 
mutually regulatory and so you're 

566
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,120
basically stuck in the middle.

567
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,133
It's half move forward and half be 
repelled and that's partly also the 

568
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:51,514
balance of those two things has helped 
is what helps you select a sexual 

569
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:58,270
partner and people generally are quite 
selective about their sexual partners.

570
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,860
So and we said,
well,

571
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:02,860
why are you selective about your sexual 
partners?

572
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,110
Well,
there's the obvious practical reasons,

573
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,123
but then there's the reasons that are 
more tightly associated with biological 

574
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:14,080
protection and so even though we don't 
like to think that way,

575
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,623
in addition to its role indirectly 
helping to expel harmful foods from the 

576
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:21,364
body,
disgust also forms an important 

577
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:24,910
component of the behavioral immune 
system,

578
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,193
the suite of psychological mechanisms 
that aid in the detection and avoidance 

579
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:33,070
of potential contaminants before they 
can make contact with the body.

580
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,323
Although disgust may have its origins in
the protection against physical 

581
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,234
contamination,
a number of studies have implicated 

582
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,200
disgust responses in moral decision 
making.

583
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,373
There's been experiments that are 
specifically associated with the 

584
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:45,874
elicitation of disgust and the 
observation of the corresponding 

585
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:49,930
behaviors in the lab.
So here,

586
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,793
here's an example.
So imagine I gave you a sterilized 

587
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,920
beaker and I said,
well,

588
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:57,280
expel some saliva into it.
Now wait 10 seconds and drink it,

589
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,960
will you?
Well,

590
00:30:58,961 --> 00:31:01,090
people know you see you made a disgust 
face,

591
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:02,980
right?
While the question is why?

592
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,200
Right?
You know it's sterile.

593
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,030
It was in your mouth,
seconds before.

594
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,690
Why all of a sudden have have you 
switched from it being part of your body

595
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:11,524
to not being part of your body and also 
being part of your body that wasn't 

596
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:15,934
ingested.
It was part of you to being something 

597
00:31:17,741 --> 00:31:20,590
that there's no damn way you're going to
have anything to do with so

598
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,680
well,
so that's a good example.

599
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:24,514
That's a good example of the of the,
of the disgust mechanism and in 

600
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,993
operation.

601
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,240
Distinguishing between self and nonself 
is a very,

602
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:34,400
very difficult thing and there's 
multiple mechanisms that do it and it's.

603
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:38,410
It's definitely necessary.
Although disgust may have its origins in

604
00:31:38,411 --> 00:31:40,540
protection against physical 
contamination,

605
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,300
a number of studies have implicated 
disgust response,

606
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,850
disgust responses in moral decision 
making.

607
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:46,863
I mean,
you know that you can see the activity 

608
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:50,134
of the behavioral immune system in such 
simple things as avoiding sources of 

609
00:31:54,971 --> 00:31:56,800
contamination on a sidewalk,
right?

610
00:31:56,801 --> 00:31:57,634
If you see something that's disgusting,
say rotting food or something like that 

611
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:01,234
on a sidewalk,
the probability that you're going to 

612
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:03,850
step in,
it is very low.

613
00:32:03,851 --> 00:32:04,684
You're going to see it and you're going 
to make a face and you're going to go 

614
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:07,654
around it,
and the reason for that is because you 

615
00:32:08,411 --> 00:32:09,244
don't want that attached to you in any 
way and the reason for that is while 

616
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:13,714
it's disgusting,
it's contaminating and the association 

617
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:16,360
there is that.

618
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,440
It's a place where you could conceivably
pick up a disease.

619
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,140
Now you see pathologies of this system 
arise,

620
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:28,090
generally obsessive compulsive disorder,
so chronic hand washing,

621
00:32:28,091 --> 00:32:28,924
for example,
is this is classified as an anxiety 

622
00:32:30,971 --> 00:32:33,490
disorder,
but there is an anxiety component to it,

623
00:32:33,491 --> 00:32:35,830
but I don't believe that that's an 
accurate classification.

624
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:36,664
I think that obsessive compulsive 
disorder is actually a disorder of 

625
00:32:38,651 --> 00:32:39,484
disgust because all of the behaviors,
including hyper grooming people 

626
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:43,604
sometimes have trichotillomania.
They'll pull out the hairs on their 

627
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:46,844
body.
The grooming behaviors and that sort of 

628
00:32:48,111 --> 00:32:48,944
thing seemed to be more associated with 
the operation of the disgust system and 

629
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:56,801
almost everything about obsessive 
compulsive disorder has a disgust basis.

630
00:32:56,901 --> 00:32:58,970
And so one of the things that people who
are,

631
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,333
who have OCD obsess about is that I've 
got a client once who was this poor 

632
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:06,800
woman by the time her ocd was done with 
her,

633
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:09,530
she built the equivalent of an airlock 
on her house,

634
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:11,870
like not technically proficient or 
anything like that.

635
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:12,943
And her husband and her children had to 
go through an elaborate decontamination 

636
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:17,750
process before they were allowed to step
foot in the house.

637
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,823
And one of the things she was very 
concerned about was that she would go 

638
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:23,940
out to a supermarket and touch a piece 
of fruit and,

639
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,833
and become contaminated and then come 
home and touch her children and then 

640
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:28,454
they would become contaminated.
And so while she ended up in the 

641
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,680
hospital and she was divorced and I had 
just did it in her life,

642
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,013
you know,
and so then people who have obsessive 

643
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:37,490
compulsive disorder,
you know,

644
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:38,324
they'll,
they'll wash their hands until the soap 

645
00:33:39,861 --> 00:33:41,750
is gone,
like a whole bar of soap.

646
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:42,584
Right.
And you can often tell who they are 

647
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:46,940
because their hands are shiny from 
Washington much and they'll shower,

648
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,833
it can't get out of the shower.
They'll shower until the hot water is 

649
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:54,260
completely gone and their self cleaning 
mechanism so to speak,

650
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:55,094
have gone seriously astray and the way 
you treat them as by exposing them to 

651
00:33:58,131 --> 00:34:00,770
things that are disgusting and 
contaminating.

652
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:07,260
I had a client with OCD once.
He was quite the character and I.

653
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,970
One of the things I had him do was we 
would look for things on the Internet,

654
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:12,680
pictures of things that really disgusted
him.

655
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:16,400
It's not that much fun by the way,
treating someone who has ocd because I'm

656
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:19,850
rather disgust sensitive.
And so that was also rather hard on me.

657
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:22,250
So anyways,
we would look for things on the Internet

658
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:23,690
that,
that he really didn't like.

659
00:34:23,691 --> 00:34:26,360
And then I'd print them out and have him
put them on his fridge,

660
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,450
which he did not like at all.
And he would,

661
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,583
he would,
he had a bunch of other problems and we 

662
00:34:31,761 --> 00:34:32,594
got along quite well.
But for a long time I treated him for 

663
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:35,564
about three years.
He would phone me like three or four 

664
00:34:37,671 --> 00:34:41,490
times a day because he had obsessive 
compulsive disorder and just swear at me

665
00:34:41,491 --> 00:34:42,480
like mad,
you know,

666
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,610
just swear it,
it,

667
00:34:43,611 --> 00:34:44,630
get these messages.

668
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:45,350
He'd,
he,

669
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,183
he phoned me and he just so mad at me 
because I'd have to put these things on 

670
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:49,980
his fridge,
you know,

671
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,133
and so he'd curse and swear and yell at 
me and then two minutes later he would 

672
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,120
phone and apologize and say he was 
really sorry.

673
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:58,340
It helped.
I would continue to see them and god,

674
00:34:58,341 --> 00:35:00,530
that just went.
Just went on forever.

675
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,940
But I felt sorry for the poor guy.
You know?

676
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:06,580
He eventually ended up getting a puppy.
A.

677
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,241
Yeah.
Yeah.

678
00:35:07,241 --> 00:35:08,820
I see you agreeable people.
Oh,

679
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,900
Papi.
God.

680
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,200
God.
Unbelievable.

681
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:13,110
A.
Yeah.

682
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,533
Anyways,
that was good for him because he had to 

683
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:17,540
go around and clean up after the PA,
PA,

684
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:20,200
but that had poor puppy.
It was quite dominant and it,

685
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,820
the things that happened to that poor 
guy,

686
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:27,950
so the puppy would dominate him,
so he'd take it outside to take it for a

687
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:30,170
walk and he wasn't a very skilled person
in many,

688
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:31,004
many ways.

689
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,353
He had a very large number of severe 
impediments and so he really liked this 

690
00:35:36,141 --> 00:35:38,250
puppy.
He didn't have any or anything like that

691
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,540
and he was supported by his aged mother,
God,

692
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,573
it was just a catastrophe and he'd go 
outside and try to walk the puppy and 

693
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:48,210
the puppy would just sit down,
right,

694
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,073
because it was doing dominant stuff and 
he didn't know how to overcome it and 

695
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,403
then these crazy people from across the 
way who styled themselves as animal 

696
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:56,274
rights activists started to harass me 
and they phoned up his mother and told 

697
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:00,210
them that if they,
if,

698
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,520
if she didn't take the dog away from 
that retard,

699
00:36:02,521 --> 00:36:03,354
they were going to come over and do 
terrible things to him and then he got 

700
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:06,804
harassed on the street and then he went 
to a park with his dog and they came up 

701
00:36:10,591 --> 00:36:13,890
to him and pushed him on the card and 
swiped his dog and ran off to the,

702
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,490
to the SPCA and dumped it there.

703
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,560
He had to move away from his apartment 
and God,

704
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:22,200
it was just,
it was just an absolute catastrophe.

705
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:24,600
They had plenty of sympathy for that 
damn dog.

706
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:26,790
But no sympathy whatsoever for the guy,
you know,

707
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,830
it was really,
it was really something.

708
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,770
Anyways,
that story ended happily weirdly enough.

709
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:36,600
He got,
he got a job with a woman who used to be

710
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:37,434
a psychiatric nurse who was training 
dogs and she gave him a little job 

711
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:44,880
setting up the dog training thing and 
then he got to learn to train his dog.

712
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:46,800
He lost like he was a thin guy to begin 
with.

713
00:36:46,801 --> 00:36:49,530
He lost like 30 pounds trying to learn 
how to take care of this puppy.

714
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:51,810
It was just,
I thought he was going to die,

715
00:36:51,811 --> 00:36:54,060
but there is no way he was going to give
up that dog.

716
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:56,760
And so anyways,
ocd,

717
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,210
it's square.
Quite the bloody catastrophe.

718
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,193
So.
And it's a good thing for someone who 

719
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:03,940
has ocd to have a dog,
right?

720
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,890
Because dogs are messy and so there's 
all sorts of things that are messy about

721
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:08,724
them.
But you have to kind of live with the 

722
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,130
mess.
Like you have to live with the mess.

723
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:11,964
If you're going to have a child or if 
you're going to have a partner of any 

724
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:14,364
sort,
you know you can't let the orderliness 

725
00:37:17,011 --> 00:37:21,180
part of you get the upper hand so 
terribly that it's impossible for you to

726
00:37:21,181 --> 00:37:22,014
live.
That's what happens to girls who have 

727
00:37:23,011 --> 00:37:24,630
anorexia.
By the way.

728
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,633
You know how you get.
There's this idea with regards to 

729
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,980
anorexia that it's often high achieving 
girls who have it well,

730
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,900
it's hyper conscientious girls.
They get so disgust sensitive.

731
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:36,960
They can't stand their own bodies and so
for example,

732
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:38,003
then they start being able to look at 
their bodies properly and so what they 

733
00:37:40,111 --> 00:37:42,000
do,
instead of looking at their whole body,

734
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:43,560
they lose the ability to do that.

735
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,633
They only can see parts of their body 
and then they can't tell the difference 

736
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,264
between a part that's healthy and well 
shaped and a fat part and so anything 

737
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:55,830
that's that's that's what would you call
of dubious.

738
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,540
Anything that's hard to measure becomes 
impossible to see.

739
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,370
So either an anorexic client at one 
point,

740
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,670
she wasn't a very big woman maybe about 
this big and thin.

741
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,930
Yes,
obviously,

742
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,153
and so I was trying to work with her on 
her body perception disorder and one of 

743
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:14,760
the things I did was,
so I had her come and sit beside me,

744
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,980
so I was sitting like this and so is 
she.

745
00:38:16,981 --> 00:38:18,690
And I said,
well you look at our two thighs,

746
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,200
which one is bigger than mine,
was like 40 percent bigger.

747
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,363
And she said,
well I can't tell they look the same to 

748
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:26,071
me.
And so I said,

749
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:27,330
okay,
this is what we're going to do.

750
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:28,650
I let her do it.
I said,

751
00:38:28,651 --> 00:38:32,970
you take a pencil and all sit on a piece
of paper and you just trace my thigh.

752
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,320
Okay.
And then you can put that piece of paper

753
00:38:35,321 --> 00:38:38,170
underneath your thigh and trace it and 
then you can look at the difference.

754
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:39,004
Well,
so I had her do that and she looked at 

755
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:42,970
the two pieces of paper and she couldn't
believe it.

756
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:47,620
She could not believe that that was 
actually the case because her perception

757
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:52,210
had become so disordered that it was 
impossible for her to see the real shape

758
00:38:52,211 --> 00:38:53,044
of her body.
And we would go outside and I would ask 

759
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:56,500
her,
is that person fan,

760
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,200
is that person fap and with other people
she could tell,

761
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:01,180
but with her own body,
not a chance.

762
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,193
She couldn't see it properly at all.
And so there was a real obsession with 

763
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:07,450
purity among women who have anorexia and
all,

764
00:39:07,451 --> 00:39:08,284
they'd like to starve themselves right 
down to the bone because the bone is 

765
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:14,530
sort of pure and white and there's no 
excess tissue on it.

766
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:17,800
And so anorexia also looks like a 
disease of disgust.

767
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,780
So it's very,
very difficult to.

768
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:20,723
She,
she thought in very black and white 

769
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:22,354
terms,
one of the things I had her do at one 

770
00:39:23,651 --> 00:39:25,960
point was said she hasn't music.
She said,

771
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,410
I either really liked a song or I don't 
like it at all.

772
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,491
And I said,
okay,

773
00:39:30,491 --> 00:39:31,324
well you've got a music collection,
why don't you go through like 20 of 

774
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:35,920
those songs and rate them on a scale 
from one to 10.

775
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,150
And she couldn't do it.
It was either yes or no orderly,

776
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,013
right?
The boundaries around the categories 

777
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:47,020
were absolutely segregated.
And her apartment tended to be decorated

778
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:49,300
in black and white and she was hyper 
clean,

779
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,343
you know,
so everything in the apartment was 

780
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:53,170
extraordinarily orderly,
well put away.

781
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:56,040
She couldn't stand to see anything 
disgusting on the counters and that sort

782
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:56,770
of thing.

783
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,603
So very,
very difficult disorder to treat 

784
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:01,390
anorexia very,
very difficult.

785
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,550
So,
and you know,

786
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:07,210
you can see how it can go wrong because 
food,

787
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:10,300
when you're eating your disgust systems 
are on alert,

788
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:11,270
you know,
like you,

789
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,203
you want the thing you want to eat and 
you absolutely don't want the thing you 

790
00:40:14,801 --> 00:40:15,634
don't want to eat and your mouth is very
sensitive to that sort of thing to the 

791
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,473
texture and all of that.
And your sense of smell is very 

792
00:40:21,101 --> 00:40:21,934
sensitive to that sort of thing because 
you know you don't want to eat anything 

793
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:27,760
that's contaminated or poisonous.
So it's another situation like sex where

794
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:31,040
the reward system is driving you forward
for,

795
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,610
to,
to engage in a conservatory behavior.

796
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:37,810
But the disgust system is right there,
Ma modulating and moderating it.

797
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:39,580
And there's a tension between those two 
things.

798
00:40:39,581 --> 00:40:42,550
That's already always at work with the 
anorexic types.

799
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,790
The discuss sense the disgust system 
gets the upper hand,

800
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,150
so she was also extraordinarily 
judgemental and perfectionistic,

801
00:40:49,151 --> 00:40:49,984
but that goes along with it because 
orderly people are judgemental and 

802
00:40:52,811 --> 00:40:55,600
perfectionistic and so if you're.
You're a perfectionist.

803
00:40:55,601 --> 00:40:59,740
Often what that means is you have very 
high levels of orderliness and very high

804
00:40:59,741 --> 00:41:00,574
levels of neuroticism and those two 
things chase each other around like mad 

805
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:04,803
because you can't stand the idea that 
you would make a mistake and you get 

806
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:07,834
anxious about it as well.
So then you get stuck in this 

807
00:41:09,611 --> 00:41:11,920
perfectionistic mindset and you can't 
get out of it.

808
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:16,540
So
inducing disgust responses,

809
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:17,374
whether via fall order,
a disgusting work environment or 

810
00:41:19,571 --> 00:41:20,404
recalling a disgusting experience led 
individuals to assign harsher 

811
00:41:23,921 --> 00:41:27,790
punishments to others who had committed 
a moral transgression.

812
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:31,390
So you you describe a moral 
transgression,

813
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,450
maybe breaking a law.
You exposed the people in the experiment

814
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,880
to some disgusting stimulus and then you
have the.

815
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:42,290
You asked them about the probability 
that the person was guilty and then also

816
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,990
how long they should be imprisoned or 
how much they should be fined.

817
00:41:44,991 --> 00:41:48,110
And if you get the people disgusted,
then the probability,

818
00:41:48,111 --> 00:41:48,944
especially if they're orderly,
then the probability of assigning a 

819
00:41:51,081 --> 00:41:53,340
harsh punishment goes upward.
So,

820
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:56,540
so if you're ever in court,
don't discuss the judge,

821
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:58,040
right?
That's part of the deal.

822
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,053
Harsher moral consump judgments can even
be induced following the consumption of 

823
00:42:03,051 --> 00:42:03,884
a bitter drink because bitter,
bitter substances are often poisoned or 

824
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:08,984
poisonous substances are often bitter 
and that induces a disgust response as 

825
00:42:12,411 --> 00:42:14,240
well.
Although you can overcome that,

826
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:16,880
coffee is bitter,
all of our bitter so you can,

827
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:20,240
you can retrain your system to accept 
those things as food,

828
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:23,890
but it's not particularly easy.
In addition,

829
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,733
the same disgust related facial 
expressions or observed in response to 

830
00:42:27,531 --> 00:42:28,364
unpleasant tastes,
disgusting photographs and receiving 

831
00:42:31,371 --> 00:42:33,890
unfair treatment in an economic game.

832
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,760
Concerns about cleanliness and 
interesting.

833
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,850
So some of you may know.
I was at mcmaster university a couple of

834
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:41,684
weeks ago and there were a bunch of 
protesters there and I went up to meet 

835
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:46,820
the protesters because I kind of wanted 
to see what would happen.

836
00:42:46,821 --> 00:42:47,654
There were a bunch of them around the 
back of the room now offered to shake 

837
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:52,100
their hands and mostly what I got was 
discussed faces,

838
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:53,360
you know,
and that's not good.

839
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,450
That's not good.
So here's something to know too.

840
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:57,703
Here's the bed,
here's a good predictor of whether or 

841
00:42:58,641 --> 00:43:02,690
not you're going to get divorced.
You go into the therapist office and you

842
00:43:02,691 --> 00:43:03,524
talk,
the two of you talk and you roll your 

843
00:43:04,671 --> 00:43:07,140
eyes.
That'll predict if you roy,

844
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,780
if you're rolling your eyes at your 
partner,

845
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,820
you're going to divorce them.
Why?

846
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:12,620
It's a disgust response,
right?

847
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:13,603
It's something like I'm lifting you up 
with my eyes and throwing you into the 

848
00:43:15,711 --> 00:43:17,450
garbage.
It's something like that,

849
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,480
but I rolling is a great predictor of 
the probability of divorce.

850
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:21,314
So.
So it's something to keep in mind with 

851
00:43:22,401 --> 00:43:23,234
regards to your relationships.
Like if you're starting to develop some 

852
00:43:25,191 --> 00:43:29,630
contempt or some disgust,
you bloody well better get on that right

853
00:43:29,631 --> 00:43:33,950
away because that's a bad road to go 
down and so well so.

854
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,280
Well.
So then you have to do whatever you have

855
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,720
to do not to go down that road.

856
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,200
Yeah.
So see,

857
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:47,000
one of the things I think that's 
happening on the political landscape and

858
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,233
like we know for example,
that the more authoritarian political 

859
00:43:50,781 --> 00:43:53,450
correct types are high in agreeableness 
and high in orderliness,

860
00:43:53,451 --> 00:43:54,284
so that's a very interesting combination
and I think what's happening is that 

861
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:00,830
they're very rapidly dividing the world 
into contemptible Predator.

862
00:44:00,831 --> 00:44:03,950
Like a snake often elicit a disgust 
response rate.

863
00:44:03,951 --> 00:44:04,784
A Predator will elicit a disgust 
response like a crocodile or an 

864
00:44:07,221 --> 00:44:08,930
alligator,
a snake or something like that,

865
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,153
and so it's the.
It's the Predator response that's being 

866
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:15,830
evoked to the people who are on the 
other side of the political spectrum,

867
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:16,693
roughly speaking,
and so they're categorized as like 

868
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,510
contemptible Predator or something like 
that,

869
00:44:20,511 --> 00:44:23,390
and the people that are being protected 
or like innocent victims.

870
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,253
It's,
it's.

871
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,890
That's how it appears and that's a very,
very dangerous thing to have happen.

872
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:28,723
As I'll show you.
Concerns about cleanliness and feelings 

873
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:33,960
of disgust have likewise been related to
political attitudes.

874
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:37,680
Situational reminders of the importance 
of physical cleanliness,

875
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:38,663
such as asking participants to wipe 
their hands with antiseptic wipes tend 

876
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:42,804
to increase.
Self reported political conservatism 

877
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:46,463
such as fine finding is consistent with 
the notion that purity tends to be 

878
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:52,920
valued more highly by conservatives than
by liberals.

879
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,413
Individuals who report being disgusted 
more easily also tend to hold more 

880
00:44:58,171 --> 00:45:00,690
conservative political views on topics 
including abortion,

881
00:45:00,691 --> 00:45:02,850
gay marriage tax cuts,
and affirmative action.

882
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,720
In addition to the effects that have 
emerged when using self reported disgust

883
00:45:06,721 --> 00:45:07,554
sensitivity,
more conservative political views have 

884
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:09,984
also been associated with stronger 
physiological reactivity to disgusting 

885
00:45:13,021 --> 00:45:14,430
images.
There's a lawyer,

886
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,293
Martha Nussbaum,
who is also a political philosopher who 

887
00:45:17,101 --> 00:45:22,101
says that we should eliminate the effect
of disgust on our political theorizing,

888
00:45:22,771 --> 00:45:23,604
that disgust shouldn't be something 
that's considered as a valid means of 

889
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:33,020
information from which you might drive 
derive political conclusions.

890
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:33,983
So if I find your behavior disgusting or
if you find my behavior disgusting 

891
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,000
according to Nussbaum,
that should be independent.

892
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,660
You should try to make that rationally 
independent of your political views.

893
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:43,703
I'd like to believe that,
but there's a problem and this is the 

894
00:45:45,601 --> 00:45:46,434
problem that we're going to go through.
You can't muck about with these 

895
00:45:48,661 --> 00:45:52,230
underlying systems.
You can't just say ignore the reports of

896
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:53,064
your disgust system because it isn't.
It isn't like your emotions are insane 

897
00:45:57,841 --> 00:45:58,674
and irrational and you have the 
rationality on top of that that's 

898
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:02,490
guiding you properly.
That isn't how it works.

899
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:06,910
All of these underlying biological 
systems guide you and to the degree that

900
00:46:06,911 --> 00:46:11,280
you're the degree to which you're guided
properly is a consequence of the balance

901
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,100
of the action of these underlying 
biological systems,

902
00:46:14,101 --> 00:46:14,934
but the balance is very complex.
We maintained you need a disgust system 

903
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:18,893
because if you didn't,
you'd eat something that would kill you 

904
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:21,503
and then you would die or you'd do 
something stupid and you'd end up like 

905
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,210
you get caught and it would be dirty and
you wouldn't clean it and then you would

906
00:46:27,211 --> 00:46:27,960
die.

907
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,793
So the idea that you can somehow just 
rationalize the output of the disgust 

908
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:33,204
system and decontaminate your political 
viewpoints as a consequence seems to be 

909
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:39,210
to be an.
It seems to me to be very,

910
00:46:39,211 --> 00:46:42,210
very naive.
Not that there's no danger to it because

911
00:46:42,211 --> 00:46:43,044
there's plenty of danger to it.
In addition to large literature has 

912
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:47,634
converged on the notion that there are 
two core dimensions of conservative 

913
00:46:50,491 --> 00:46:52,950
political ideology,
resistance to change,

914
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:57,570
and tolerance of inequality.
Resistance to change reflects the extent

915
00:46:57,571 --> 00:46:59,820
to which people wish to maintain the 
status quo.

916
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:00,863
While tolerance of inequality reflects 
the acceptance of an unequal 

917
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:06,180
distribution of resources and 
opportunities within society.

918
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,253
Joest has done a lot of that work.
Jostes supervisor as Banerji and 

919
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,433
Missouri and Banerji is unknown Marxist,
and so this is another place where 

920
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:19,920
political ideology contaminates as far 
as I'm concerned,

921
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:24,921
scientific inquiry,
because jostes work on on on,

922
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:26,423
let's say resistance to change is 
predicated on the idea that the 

923
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:30,214
conservative in the conservative 
inclination to support the maintenance 

924
00:47:34,871 --> 00:47:35,704
of already existing structures is 
precisely equivalent to supporting an 

925
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:42,400
unjust system,
and that's not a reasonable thing to do.

926
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,490
If you're looking at these sorts of 
things from a scientific perspective,

927
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:47,020
you don't get to make judgments like 
that,

928
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:49,210
but they're built into the 
questionnaires,

929
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:50,703
so resistance to change reflects the 
extent to which people wish to maintain 

930
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:54,964
the status quo.
While tolerance of inequality reflects 

931
00:47:57,071 --> 00:47:57,904
the acceptance of an unequal 
distribution of resources and 

932
00:47:59,561 --> 00:48:00,394
opportunities within society,
these two dimensions appear roughly 

933
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:04,384
aligned with social and economic 
conservatism as expressed in the 

934
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:07,714
constructs of right wing 
authoritarianism and social dominance 

935
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:10,714
orientation respectively.
There is no left wing authoritarian 

936
00:48:13,751 --> 00:48:16,960
psychological scales.
We're trying to derive one right now,

937
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,620
but the reason for that is that after 
World War Two,

938
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,153
the social science community was 
responding to what had happened in Nazi 

939
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:24,903
Germany and perfectly appropriately and 
they examined right wing 

940
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:28,383
authoritarianism as a consequence,
but they never examined left wing 

941
00:48:30,761 --> 00:48:34,030
authoritarianism because the prevailing,
what would you call it,

942
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:35,103
political landscape of the time 
proscribed made the idea that there 

943
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:40,714
could be left wing authoritarianism 
sufficiently incorrect politically so 

944
00:48:44,231 --> 00:48:47,260
that it was never analyzed from the 
perspective of social science.

945
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:48,303
Even though the evidence for left wing 
authoritarianism say by the end of the 

946
00:48:50,981 --> 00:48:53,890
19 forties,
was absolutely overwhelming.

947
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:55,330
Right?
By the 19 thirties,

948
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:58,420
people were reporting on what had 
happened in the Soviet Union.

949
00:48:58,421 --> 00:49:00,890
You know the forest,
the forest decolonization,

950
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,133
for example,
of the agricultural industry in the 

951
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,333
Soviet Union and the consequence death 
consequent deaths of several million 

952
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:09,154
people in the Ukraine.
It was all extraordinarily well 

953
00:49:10,571 --> 00:49:11,404
documented.
These core facets of conservatism are 

954
00:49:14,471 --> 00:49:15,304
also closely related to the two higher 
order value dimensions described in 

955
00:49:18,101 --> 00:49:18,934
moral foundations theory,
which reflect preferences for order and 

956
00:49:21,851 --> 00:49:22,684
tradition on the one hand and 
preferences for egalitarianism on the 

957
00:49:25,361 --> 00:49:27,040
other.
Importantly,

958
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:31,300
the motivational basis of these two 
dimensions appears to vary independently

959
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,134
from one another with an individual's 
overall political attitudes on the left 

960
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:37,690
right spectrum emerging from their 
relative balance.

961
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:39,543
These motives are also strongly rooted 
rooted in basic personality 

962
00:49:42,671 --> 00:49:43,504
characteristics such that preferences 
for order and tradition are associated 

963
00:49:46,541 --> 00:49:48,040
with higher levels of orderliness.

964
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:49,660
Now,
you might think that's obvious,

965
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:50,494
right?
While obviously orderliness is 

966
00:49:51,761 --> 00:49:54,820
associated with preference for order,
that's not the issue.

967
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,390
The issue is whether or not you can 
measure it right?

968
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:01,180
That's the issue,
so these things seem self evident,

969
00:50:01,181 --> 00:50:04,510
but it's taken a very long time to build
up the instruments that allow them to be

970
00:50:04,511 --> 00:50:05,344
measured in such a way that you can also
start to look at the correlates and the 

971
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:12,730
underlying psychophysiology so it's by 
no means obvious

972
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:15,693
higher levels of orderliness and aspect 
of conscientiousness and politeness and 

973
00:50:18,971 --> 00:50:22,600
aspect of agreeableness as well as lower
levels of openness and intellect.

974
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:23,943
In contrast,
preferences for egalitarianism are 

975
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:29,150
uniquely associated with compassion and 
aspect of agreeableness,

976
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,433
so and that's exactly what we found when
we were looking at political 

977
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:34,004
correctness,
which is primarily predicted not by 

978
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:38,060
openness or by conscientiousness,
but by agreeableness.

979
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:39,643
Political conservatism can therefore be 
thought of as a social immune system 

980
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:47,990
reflecting the extension of pathogen 
avoidance mechanisms to the integrity of

981
00:50:47,991 --> 00:50:48,890
the social system.

982
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:50,860
Borders boundaries,
right?

983
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:54,080
That's the orderly person.
We'll keep borders between concepts.

984
00:50:54,081 --> 00:50:57,290
We'll keep borders between people.
We'll keep borders between towns.

985
00:50:57,291 --> 00:51:01,190
We'll keep borders between political 
ideas and religions and states.

986
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:02,203
Why?
Because we don't want that terrible 

987
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:07,070
things flooding in from everywhere.
Now the liberal will say,

988
00:51:07,071 --> 00:51:07,904
wait a minute.
All the things flooding in from 

989
00:51:08,811 --> 00:51:12,470
everywhere aren't terrible.
They have great utility and that's true,

990
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:13,423
but the problem is they're both true.
They're both true at the same time 

991
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:19,610
because well and will document that as 
we move forward.

992
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:20,870
So then the question is,
well,

993
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:23,900
how do you know when things should be 
more open and when things should be more

994
00:51:23,901 --> 00:51:26,000
closed and the answer to that is,
well,

995
00:51:26,001 --> 00:51:26,834
you better have a chat with everyone and
find out what they think because it's a 

996
00:51:29,481 --> 00:51:30,314
balance of probabilities.
There's no way of determining at a 

997
00:51:32,301 --> 00:51:33,134
priority.
It's a balance of probabilities and so 

998
00:51:34,611 --> 00:51:35,444
you have to have a discussion to 
determine how wide the gates should be 

999
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:40,850
open and how narrow they should be 
closed,

1000
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:41,803
and that's also going to depend on the 
circumstances and the situation so 

1001
00:51:44,451 --> 00:51:45,284
there's no way of the faith.
This is the thing that's so terrible 

1002
00:51:47,091 --> 00:51:50,150
about this.
There's no way of determining a priority

1003
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:51,440
who's positioning is correct.

1004
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:55,030
Just as the behavioral.
Yes,

1005
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:55,963
in particular,
the social immune system would help to 

1006
00:51:57,201 --> 00:52:00,890
maintain order by suppressing any 
actions or individuals that deviate from

1007
00:52:00,891 --> 00:52:04,340
a group's accepted social traditions.
It has been reported,

1008
00:52:04,341 --> 00:52:05,174
for example,
that regions with higher levels of 

1009
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:07,664
disease prevalence tend to be associated
with higher levels of social conformity 

1010
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:12,830
and autocratic rule.

1011
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,393
Individuals who feel more vulnerable to 
disease likely likewise report higher 

1012
00:52:17,731 --> 00:52:20,070
levels of ethnocentrism,
xenophobia,

1013
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:21,383
such basic concerns about pathogen 
avoidance may thus contribute to the 

1014
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:27,420
desire for order and tradition among 
conservatives along with the harsh moral

1015
00:52:27,421 --> 00:52:30,330
judgements associated with violations of
the social order.

1016
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:33,480
How do you purify something?
How about with fire?

1017
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:34,883
That's something to keep in mind as we 
move towards the more political 

1018
00:52:36,931 --> 00:52:41,220
expressions of this and the thing about 
something that's disgusting is you don't

1019
00:52:41,221 --> 00:52:43,560
isolate it exactly.
You destroy it,

1020
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:44,483
right?
It's the thing you do with rats and 

1021
00:52:46,441 --> 00:52:47,640
insects,
for example,

1022
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,710
is destroy them right,
and you do that with poison.

1023
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:51,563
You do it with fire,
you do it by cleaning things up and you 

1024
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:54,504
do that because while the rats will eat 
all your crops and the insects carry 

1025
00:52:56,971 --> 00:53:00,000
disease and all of that so it or the 
infest your food,

1026
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,140
which I don't know what proportion of 
today's food production is eaten by rats

1027
00:53:04,141 --> 00:53:06,170
and insects,
but it's a huge proportion still

1028
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:12,540
according to the parasite stress 
hypothesis,

1029
00:53:12,541 --> 00:53:13,374
authoritarian governments are more 
likely to emerge in regions 

1030
00:53:16,561 --> 00:53:19,710
characterized by a high prevalence of 
disease causing pathogens.

1031
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:20,693
Now,
who the hell would have ever guessed 

1032
00:53:21,361 --> 00:53:21,811
that,
hey,

1033
00:53:21,811 --> 00:53:22,644
this is where you see the real utility 
of a genuine social because it's by no 

1034
00:53:26,281 --> 00:53:27,114
means self evident.
This hypothesis and this paper that I'm 

1035
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:32,610
going to discuss with you right now just
blew me away when I read it.

1036
00:53:32,611 --> 00:53:35,310
I thought it should have been front page
news across the world,

1037
00:53:35,311 --> 00:53:37,740
but he didn't really track that much 
attention.

1038
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:41,670
Recent cross national evidence is 
consistent with this hypothesis,

1039
00:53:41,671 --> 00:53:44,640
but there are inferential limitations 
associated with that evidence.

1040
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:45,703
We report to studies that address some 
of the limitations and provide further 

1041
00:53:48,331 --> 00:53:49,164
tests of the hypothesis.
Study one revealed that parasite 

1042
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:54,173
prevalence strongly predicted cross 
national differences on measures 

1043
00:53:57,451 --> 00:54:00,390
assessing individual's authoritarian 
personalities,

1044
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,860
so that's very interesting.

1045
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:07,100
So the more parasitic and transmissible 
diseases in a particular locale,

1046
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:09,443
the higher the probability that people 
when measured at the individual level 

1047
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:15,120
held authoritarian attitudes because you
might say,

1048
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:15,954
well,
there's parasite prevalence that 

1049
00:54:17,101 --> 00:54:17,934
produces a repressive government,
but it doesn't really affect people at 

1050
00:54:20,251 --> 00:54:23,130
the level of personality and that's not 
what was found in the studies.

1051
00:54:23,131 --> 00:54:27,000
It was reversed.
The parasite prevalence slash infectious

1052
00:54:27,001 --> 00:54:27,834
diseases made people more authoritarian 
and that was what was driving the more 

1053
00:54:30,961 --> 00:54:33,450
authoritarian government.
So here's something cool.

1054
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,010
Who knows about this?
Right?

1055
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,920
So how do you fight authoritarian 
governments across the world?

1056
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:41,850
You get rid of infectious disease.
That could be it,

1057
00:54:41,851 --> 00:54:43,890
that could be the key.
So in there,

1058
00:54:43,891 --> 00:54:46,170
and again not that is by no means is 
self evident.

1059
00:54:46,171 --> 00:54:47,004
Hypothesis study one that revealed that 
parasite prevalence strongly predicted 

1060
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:52,554
cross national differences on measures 
assessing individual's authoritarian 

1061
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:56,004
personalities and this effect 
statistically mediated the relationship 

1062
00:54:58,681 --> 00:55:02,040
between parasite prevalence and 
authoritarian governance parasites,

1063
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:04,230
personality,
authoritarian state.

1064
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,093
That's the causal pathway.
This mediation result is inconsistent 

1065
00:55:07,921 --> 00:55:08,754
with alternative explanations for 
previous findings to address further 

1066
00:55:11,161 --> 00:55:11,994
limitations associated with cross 
national comparison study to tested the 

1067
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:19,770
parasite stress hypothesis on a sample 
of traditional small scale societies,

1068
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,023
results revealed that parasite 
prevalence predicted measures of 

1069
00:55:24,481 --> 00:55:29,070
authoritarian governance and did so even
when statistically controlling for other

1070
00:55:29,071 --> 00:55:29,904
threats to human welfare.
What additional threat famine also 

1071
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:33,624
uniquely predicted authoritarianism.
Together these results further 

1072
00:55:36,511 --> 00:55:37,344
substantiate the parasite stress 
hypothesis of authoritarianism and 

1073
00:55:40,651 --> 00:55:41,484
suggested societal differences in 
authoritarian governance result in part 

1074
00:55:44,671 --> 00:55:45,504
from cultural differences in 
individual's authoritarian 

1075
00:55:47,521 --> 00:55:50,430
personalities.
Here's the effect sizes,

1076
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:52,740
so look,
they're mind boggling.

1077
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,680
So first that's authoritarian 
governments one,

1078
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,350
pathogen prevalence,
the correlation is point four,

1079
00:55:58,351 --> 00:56:00,840
two
point four,

1080
00:56:00,841 --> 00:56:01,920
two,
right?

1081
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,260
There's malnutrition,
there's warfare,

1082
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:06,360
it's actually negatively correlated with
warfare.

1083
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:07,890
Famine point two,
six.

1084
00:56:07,891 --> 00:56:08,724
So if you square that,
that's about eight percent of the 

1085
00:56:09,751 --> 00:56:10,350
variance.

1086
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:15,350
That's about 16 percent of the variance.
So those are walloping effect sizes,

1087
00:56:16,861 --> 00:56:18,990
right?
That effect size is about.

1088
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,153
So that 16 percent,
the typical effect size for a 

1089
00:56:21,931 --> 00:56:22,764
personality,
variables about point two to point 

1090
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:25,510
three.
So let's say point two five.

1091
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:27,700
So that's about seven percent of the 
variance,

1092
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:28,773
that 16 to 17 percent of the variance.
You almost never see a correlation of 

1093
00:56:32,381 --> 00:56:34,330
that size.
So it's,

1094
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,313
it's an absolutely remarkable piece of 
work and it has all sorts of terrifying 

1095
00:56:40,151 --> 00:56:41,920
implications.
So the question is,

1096
00:56:41,921 --> 00:56:45,430
now why would you have such a powerful 
immune system?

1097
00:56:45,431 --> 00:56:47,290
Behavioral Immune System,
disgust system.

1098
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:50,050
Okay.
So let's look at some little known facts

1099
00:56:50,051 --> 00:56:50,884
about the history of North America.
I don't know how many of you guys know 

1100
00:56:53,021 --> 00:56:54,700
this,
but it's worth knowing.

1101
00:56:55,390 --> 00:56:57,580
Okay.
So what was the pre Colombian population

1102
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:58,414
of the Americas?
The answer is we don't really have any 

1103
00:56:59,951 --> 00:57:00,610
idea.

1104
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:01,443
The estimates vary from 10 million to 
$100 million with an emerging consensus 

1105
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:06,280
of 50 million.
Well,

1106
00:57:06,281 --> 00:57:07,180
it's halfway.
Okay.

1107
00:57:07,181 --> 00:57:08,014
We don't know.
We could be out by one order of 

1108
00:57:09,011 --> 00:57:10,930
magnitude,
but a fair number of people.

1109
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:13,120
So what happened to all the native 
Americans?

1110
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,433
Well,
that's easy.

1111
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,390
They all died.
Why?

1112
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:17,493
Because when the Spaniards came,
see there was no diseases in the new 

1113
00:57:20,321 --> 00:57:21,154
world except for maybe syphilis.
There's some evidence that syphilis was 

1114
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,544
trends mended back to Europe as a 
consequence of contact with North 

1115
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:29,860
America,
north and South America,

1116
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,560
but there are almost no diseases in,
in,

1117
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:33,820
in,
in the Americas,

1118
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:34,803
and that's partly because there were no 
big cities and also because even where 

1119
00:57:37,841 --> 00:57:42,160
there weren't compared to Europe and 
also because where there were big cities

1120
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:44,500
in Europe,
people live close with animals and there

1121
00:57:44,501 --> 00:57:45,334
was lots of movement of disease 
pathogens back and forth between the 

1122
00:57:47,711 --> 00:57:48,820
animals and the human beings.

1123
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:51,460
And so lots of Europeans died as a 
consequence of that.

1124
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:52,833
Huge numbers of them,
especially from diseases say like 

1125
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:56,770
smallpox or or measles or,
and.

1126
00:57:57,010 --> 00:58:00,940
But the Europeans built up a whopping 
immunity to all these diseases including

1127
00:58:00,941 --> 00:58:01,774
influenza.
And then they came to the Americas with 

1128
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,960
their diseases and bang,
it killed all of the native Americans if

1129
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:09,520
figured 90 percent of them.
So here's some of the statistics.

1130
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,010
What are the diseases that wiped them 
out?

1131
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,260
Influenza,
bluebonnet plagues,

1132
00:58:14,261 --> 00:58:15,250
smallpox.
Measles.

1133
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:18,790
Chicken pox was deadly to the native 
Americans.

1134
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:24,060
So from 1492 to 1650,
there was a death toll of 90 percent.

1135
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:26,493
So you know,
when the puritans landed in the US at 

1136
00:58:28,751 --> 00:58:31,180
Plymouth Rock,
that was a long time after the Spaniards

1137
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:32,440
had landed in,
in,

1138
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:34,840
in the more southern areas,
the Indians,

1139
00:58:34,841 --> 00:58:35,674
the native Americans there,
they were desperate to see them because 

1140
00:58:37,901 --> 00:58:39,910
they didn't have enough people to take 
off their crops.

1141
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:43,570
They didn't have enough people left.
Imagine nine out of 10 people died.

1142
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,540
That's everyone right that you're done 
at that point.

1143
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:47,953
So there were 20 to 25 to 30 million 
people in Mexico before the arrival of 

1144
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:55,000
Cortez.
Fifty years later there were 3 million.

1145
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:56,663
So,
and the aboriginal population in Canada 

1146
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,910
estimates this is accepted by the 
Canadian government.

1147
00:59:00,911 --> 00:59:03,490
No one really knows and the estimates do
vary substantially.

1148
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,690
There might have been 500,000 people in 
Canada in 1450,

1149
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:11,350
and that decreased by 80 percent after 
contact with the Europeans.

1150
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,780
There's the population collapse in 
Mexico.

1151
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,750
Sixteenth Century population collapse in
Mexico.

1152
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,140
So the 15,
45 and 15,

1153
00:59:20,141 --> 00:59:20,974
76 appeared to have been hemorrhagic 
fevers caused by an indigenous viral 

1154
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:28,100
agent and aggravated by unusual climatic
conditions.

1155
00:59:28,101 --> 00:59:31,970
The Mexican population did not recover,
recover to pre Hispanic levels until the

1156
00:59:31,971 --> 00:59:36,110
20th century.
Absolutely catastrophic consequences.

1157
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,690
So then you look at that and you think,
well,

1158
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:39,763
is it really all that surprising that 
people have evolved extraordinarily 

1159
00:59:42,441 --> 00:59:45,710
powerful immune systems,
disgust responses,

1160
00:59:45,711 --> 00:59:47,150
and behavioral immune systems.

1161
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,350
I mean,
this is no joke.

1162
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,393
It's absolutely catastrophic.
So now I want to talk to you a little 

1163
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:57,740
bit about Hitler.
So when I was sorting some of this stuff

1164
00:59:57,741 --> 00:59:58,574
out,
trying to look at this disgust 

1165
01:00:00,531 --> 01:00:01,364
sensitivity literature and then 
understanding finally that it was 

1166
01:00:03,741 --> 01:00:04,574
associated with orderliness,
orderliness is associated with 

1167
01:00:06,681 --> 01:00:07,514
conservatism.
I was also reading a book by Adolf 

1168
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:12,020
Hitler,
which was called Hitler's table talk.

1169
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:12,883
It's a very interesting book and Hitler 
had secretaries at his dinner tables 

1170
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:18,283
from 1939 to 1942 and they basically 
took shorthand notes of what he said 

1171
01:00:21,891 --> 01:00:22,724
spontaneously,
and so there's a book that you can buy 

1172
01:00:24,051 --> 01:00:25,920
called Hitler's table talk that,
that,

1173
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,133
that is nothing but a presentation of 
his spontaneous utterances across that 

1174
01:00:30,741 --> 01:00:31,574
time period.
Now,

1175
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:35,060
Hitler was a very strange person.
He was very high in openness,

1176
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:38,000
surprisingly enough,
but also extremely high in orderliness.

1177
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:40,820
At least that's what you can infer from 
reading the historical data,

1178
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:43,160
so he bathed four times a day,
for example.

1179
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:45,350
He was also a great admirer of 
willpower,

1180
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:46,184
so which is something that's also 
associated with conscientiousness and 

1181
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,273
orderliness.
He was very proud of his ability to 

1182
01:00:50,901 --> 01:00:51,734
stand like this for eight hours in the 
back of a car and his ability to 

1183
01:00:54,231 --> 01:00:55,520
withstand,
you know,

1184
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,270
what would you call them?
Trying circumstances by willpower alone.

1185
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:00,283
One of the most famous film 
documentaries that was made in the Nazi 

1186
01:01:02,391 --> 01:01:04,610
era was called triumph of the will,
right?

1187
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:07,850
Triumph of willpower.
That was by Leni Riefenstahl.

1188
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:10,790
I'm not saying that quite right.
You can look at that on youtube.

1189
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:13,820
It's a very interesting film.
Horrifying film,

1190
01:01:13,821 --> 01:01:15,260
but a very interesting one.
Well,

1191
01:01:15,261 --> 01:01:16,930
if you're wondering about orderliness 
and mean,

1192
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:20,030
take a look at that man.
So that's Nuremberg,

1193
01:01:20,031 --> 01:01:20,864
right?
That was the biggest rally grounds ever 

1194
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:22,544
made in human history.
Nuremberg and Hitler was unbelievably 

1195
01:01:24,591 --> 01:01:27,470
good at spectacle.
Look at how absolutely perfectly ordered

1196
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:28,343
daddy's.

1197
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,730
God only knows how many people.
They're several hundred thousand because

1198
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:33,650
they could all fit on the parade ground 
at the same time.

1199
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:38,830
All in absolutely perfect formation.
Orderliness gone out of control.

1200
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:44,350
It's interesting because people think 
about Nazi-ism Nazi as a method descends

1201
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,560
into barbarity,
right?

1202
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:48,710
But what it looks like is a disease of 
civilization.

1203
01:01:48,711 --> 01:01:51,500
That's a whole different thing because 
conscientiousness predicts,

1204
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:54,770
be predict success in complex industrial
societies,

1205
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:55,783
and this is actually conscientiousness 
gone out of control on the orderly end 

1206
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:00,230
of things and why?
Why?

1207
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:01,093
Well,
the twenties,

1208
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:02,213
the World War One,
that was plenty chaotic and there was a 

1209
01:02:04,311 --> 01:02:07,520
huge famine after World War One right in
Spanish.

1210
01:02:07,521 --> 01:02:12,521
Influenza killed more people than the 
war did and he'd actually mutated in the

1211
01:02:13,011 --> 01:02:13,844
trenches because if people are packed 
close together than viruses or other 

1212
01:02:17,241 --> 01:02:18,074
pathogens can be very deadly because you
don't have to live very long to give it 

1213
01:02:20,731 --> 01:02:22,660
to her.
If people are dispersed,

1214
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:23,523
then the virus or the bacteria can't 
afford to kill you as fast because then 

1215
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:27,570
it dies too.

1216
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:28,703
And so if you pack people together,
then you can breed unbelievably variant 

1217
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:33,240
forms of pathogens,
infectious pathogens.

1218
01:02:33,241 --> 01:02:34,680
And that's what happened in World War 
One.

1219
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:37,410
Packed all the men together in 
unsanitary conditions,

1220
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,341
poof.
Up came,

1221
01:02:38,341 --> 01:02:39,174
Spanish,
influenza went all around the world 

1222
01:02:40,531 --> 01:02:42,810
after World War One and killed more 
people than the war.

1223
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:46,350
So after the war,
after World War One,

1224
01:02:46,351 --> 01:02:49,920
of course,
Germany descended into utter chaos.

1225
01:02:49,921 --> 01:02:52,140
And so what happens when you descend 
into chaos?

1226
01:02:52,141 --> 01:02:54,960
And the answer is there's a 
corresponding call for order.

1227
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:56,063
And that was answered by the that was 
answered by Hitler and the National 

1228
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,440
Socialists.
And Hitler was very good at listening to

1229
01:03:01,441 --> 01:03:02,274
the German population and what they were
demanding in a period of chaos was 

1230
01:03:05,821 --> 01:03:06,654
order.
And so that was exactly what he decided 

1231
01:03:08,431 --> 01:03:09,264
to provide spectacles of order,
which is exactly what you'd expect from 

1232
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:15,210
someone who is really high in openness 
and high in orderliness.

1233
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:19,260
Spectacles of order.
And Hitler was also extremely interested

1234
01:03:19,261 --> 01:03:20,094
in art,
but he categorized art into like proper 

1235
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:24,083
hygienic art and improper chaotic art.
And he often would have art exhibits at 

1236
01:03:30,751 --> 01:03:33,600
the same time have the approved art that
he approved of.

1237
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,270
So those were in the official museums,
let's say,

1238
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,313
and then there would be a corresponding 
exhibit of degenerate art and that that 

1239
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:44,040
was art that was associated with 
movements like expression isn't,

1240
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:44,874
for example,
which has garish colors and it's very 

1241
01:03:46,471 --> 01:03:47,304
emotionally expressive.
Hitler sort of preferred Kinda 

1242
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:53,910
eroticized Greco Roman representations 
of heroic people.

1243
01:03:53,911 --> 01:03:54,744
You know,
that was the Nazi aesthetic ascent 

1244
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:56,633
essentially.
So there are some more examples of 

1245
01:03:59,431 --> 01:04:00,211
order,
right?

1246
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,070
Look at that.
Everything,

1247
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:03,210
everything.
Geometric,

1248
01:04:03,211 --> 01:04:05,640
everything regular.
The borders completely well defined.

1249
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,550
Everything here is squares.
Everyone's lined up perfectly.

1250
01:04:08,551 --> 01:04:10,310
Everything is uniform,
right?

1251
01:04:10,330 --> 01:04:13,620
Look at there's pathways between the 
rows of people.

1252
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,940
This is again at Nuremberg,

1253
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:21,470
perfect order along with his plans for 
the world capital Germania,

1254
01:04:21,471 --> 01:04:24,020
Elbert spear,
that was the Nazi architect,

1255
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:26,450
made the plans for the world's largest 
stadium,

1256
01:04:26,451 --> 01:04:28,250
which was to be located on the Nuremberg
rally.

1257
01:04:28,251 --> 01:04:31,160
Grounds derived from the pen,
authentic stadium of Athens.

1258
01:04:31,161 --> 01:04:31,994
It would have offered 400,000 seats.
It was good to get the shape of a horse 

1259
01:04:35,731 --> 01:04:38,120
shoe planned dimensions,
800 meters wide,

1260
01:04:38,121 --> 01:04:38,954
450 meters high,
100 meters with a building area of 

1261
01:04:41,451 --> 01:04:42,284
350,000 square meters.
The laying of the foundation stone was 

1262
01:04:45,141 --> 01:04:46,970
on ninth of July,
1937.

1263
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:51,590
It was to be finished for the party 
congress of 1945 in 38.

1264
01:04:51,591 --> 01:04:53,480
The construction began with the 
excavation.

1265
01:04:53,481 --> 01:04:55,640
It was stopped in 39,
but during the whole war,

1266
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:59,270
the casting pitt had to be kept dry for 
mentoring groundwater after the war,

1267
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:00,104
the northern half of the pit filled up 
with water and is today called silver 

1268
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:03,823
silver lake.
The southern half was used to deposit 

1269
01:05:05,811 --> 01:05:08,390
the debris of the destroyed downtown 
Nuremberg.

1270
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:12,443
That's Nuremberg at night.
So what Hitler did because he was very 

1271
01:05:15,871 --> 01:05:18,340
good at using fire and as display as 
well.

1272
01:05:18,341 --> 01:05:20,830
So those,
that curtain there.

1273
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:22,263
So you see there's the Nuremberg 
buildings that we saw in the last 

1274
01:05:24,611 --> 01:05:28,480
photograph that those are the search 
lights from the from the Nazi air force.

1275
01:05:28,481 --> 01:05:29,314
So they had the parade all the way 
around the grounds there and pointed 

1276
01:05:32,801 --> 01:05:33,634
straight up.
So that night time rallies were 

1277
01:05:35,830 --> 01:05:40,000
illuminated by a cube of light,
very effective.

1278
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:41,980
What?
Display?

1279
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,233
Artistic display of orderliness.
Now here's where things get seriously 

1280
01:05:47,231 --> 01:05:48,760
ugly.
So this is a.

1281
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:52,330
This is a pamphlet from I think 19.
Yeah,

1282
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,313
1944.
And the pamphlet is called a Jew as 

1283
01:05:57,341 --> 01:06:00,250
world parasite.
So this is something I found on the net.

1284
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:01,840
I'll share it with you.
Very rare,

1285
01:06:01,841 --> 01:06:02,830
original,
late 19,

1286
01:06:02,831 --> 01:06:05,170
44,
anti Jewish Third Reich pamphlet.

1287
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:08,380
This very scare six by eight and three 
quarters.

1288
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:09,214
20 page soft cover booklet by MRI for an
Erik Schwartzberg was published 1944 in 

1289
01:06:14,081 --> 01:06:14,914
Frankfurt.
It was published at a time when a great 

1290
01:06:16,001 --> 01:06:16,834
percentage of the European Jews had 
already been deported to concentration 

1291
01:06:19,091 --> 01:06:19,924
camps in the east perhaps to justify 
what had happened to the Jews since the 

1292
01:06:22,751 --> 01:06:23,584
Nazi seizure of power.
The authors compared the Jews with 

1293
01:06:25,541 --> 01:06:26,374
parasites,
the most unpleasant forms of life on 

1294
01:06:28,511 --> 01:06:30,160
earth,
and that it is only natural,

1295
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:31,023
unjustified against them to free 
humanity of them for the sake of 

1296
01:06:33,251 --> 01:06:34,450
survival of mankind.

1297
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,433
This is from the pamphlet the people of 
the world will recognize the Jew as 

1298
01:06:40,991 --> 01:06:42,880
world parasite.
And there will be a time when there will

1299
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:46,030
be one united front of all people 
against the Jewish world parasite,

1300
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:46,893
the pamphlet ends and humanity will be 
freed from the most severe illness from 

1301
01:06:50,081 --> 01:06:51,610
which he suffered from thousands of 
years.

1302
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:53,930
Here's what happened in Nazi Germany.
So when,

1303
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:55,690
when,
when Hitler came to power,

1304
01:06:55,870 --> 01:07:00,870
he was very interested in public health 
campaigns and so he said he formulated a

1305
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:01,984
number of policies including formulating
these vans that went around screening 

1306
01:07:06,311 --> 01:07:09,130
people for tuberculosis at the same time
be announced,

1307
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:11,890
announced a policy to beautify and 
purify Germany.

1308
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:12,963
And so he encouraged the factory owners 
to clean up the factories to get rid of 

1309
01:07:16,451 --> 01:07:19,390
the rats and the insects and to plant 
flowers and so forth in front.

1310
01:07:19,391 --> 01:07:20,980
Right?
So it was cleanliness and beauty.

1311
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,203
They used Zyklon b as the agent for,
for disinfecting the factories as icon 

1312
01:07:27,191 --> 01:07:28,024
be cycle.
And B was the gas that was used in the 

1313
01:07:29,681 --> 01:07:30,514
gas chambers.
So Hitler started out by getting rid of 

1314
01:07:32,321 --> 01:07:35,440
the rats and the parasites and the 
insects in Germany,

1315
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:36,453
along with this public health campaign.
And then he moved into the insane 

1316
01:07:38,711 --> 01:07:40,780
asylums and started a euthanasia 
campaign,

1317
01:07:40,781 --> 01:07:41,614
and then he moved outside into the 
broader political sphere and started to 

1318
01:07:43,871 --> 01:07:47,230
target the people that he didn't 
consider pure as parasites,

1319
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:48,243
capitalizing on the behavioral immune 
system and people's intrinsic sense of 

1320
01:07:51,491 --> 01:07:53,410
disgust.
And so I'm going to show you some of the

1321
01:07:53,411 --> 01:07:56,650
propaganda that did that so that you 
know how this sort of thing works.

1322
01:07:57,850 --> 01:08:01,600
Okay.
So this is from Richard Koenigsberg,

1323
01:08:01,601 --> 01:08:02,434
who wrote a book called Hitler's 
ideology embodied metaphor fantasy in 

1324
01:08:05,501 --> 01:08:06,910
history.
So we've already.

1325
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:09,130
We've already sort of discussed the 
idea.

1326
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:13,000
This is sort of an archetypal idea,
grounded in biology.

1327
01:08:13,001 --> 01:08:13,834
You know that you're,
you're running in some on this 

1328
01:08:15,501 --> 01:08:16,334
underlying biological platform of deeply
rooted hypothalamic systems and 

1329
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:20,193
[inaudible] systems and so forth that,
that and that you're a collection of 

1330
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:24,974
those underlying systems organized at 
some higher order level while those 

1331
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:31,160
underlying systems manifest themselves 
in fantasy.

1332
01:08:31,161 --> 01:08:33,140
So for example,
if you're hungry,

1333
01:08:33,141 --> 01:08:33,974
you're going to get a fantasy about 
going to get something to eat and if 

1334
01:08:35,601 --> 01:08:36,434
you're lonely,
you're going to get a fantasy about 

1335
01:08:37,251 --> 01:08:39,350
someone that you'd like to be with.
And so forth,

1336
01:08:39,351 --> 01:08:40,184
because the fantasy is part of the 
manner in which these underlying 

1337
01:08:42,711 --> 01:08:45,380
biological motivation systems think,
okay,

1338
01:08:45,381 --> 01:08:46,214
so what do you think?
How do you think and talk if you're 

1339
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:50,630
possessed by disgust.
Okay.

1340
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:52,760
The state did.
This is.

1341
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:55,670
This is from Hitler,
Hitler's utterances.

1342
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,880
The state did not possess the power to 
master the disease.

1343
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:01,460
The menacing decay of the Reich was 
manifest.

1344
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:02,533
The masses feel that the mere fact of 
the Jews existence is as bad as the 

1345
01:09:05,331 --> 01:09:06,164
plague.
Politicians tinkering around on the 

1346
01:09:08,151 --> 01:09:08,984
German national body,
so most of the forms of our general 

1347
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:12,614
disease,
but blindly ignored the virus at the 

1348
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:16,184
time of the unification,
the inner decay was already in full 

1349
01:09:18,561 --> 01:09:22,100
swing and the general situation was 
deteriorating from year to year.

1350
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,680
The Nation did not grow inwardly 
healthier,

1351
01:09:24,681 --> 01:09:27,920
but obviously languished more and more.
It's all disease metaphor.

1352
01:09:27,921 --> 01:09:28,754
It's all disease metaphor.
The symptoms of decay of the prewar 

1353
01:09:31,191 --> 01:09:36,191
period can be reduced to racial causes.
Anyone who wants to cure this era,

1354
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:37,783
which is inwardly sick and rotten,
must first of all summoned up the 

1355
01:09:40,101 --> 01:09:42,500
courage to make clear the causes of the 
disease.

1356
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:45,740
They think that they must demonstrate 
that they are ready for appeasement,

1357
01:09:45,741 --> 01:09:50,270
so as to stay the deadly cancerous ulcer
through a potter policy of moderation.

1358
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:53,210
The Jew must take care of that.
The plague does not die.

1359
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:54,703
If this battle should not come,
Germany would decay and it best would 

1360
01:09:57,021 --> 01:09:57,854
sync to ruin like a rotting corpse.
You can see in the right today an 

1361
01:10:00,591 --> 01:10:01,424
example of mortal decay that is not the 
speech of someone who's possessed by 

1362
01:10:06,111 --> 01:10:06,944
anxiety.
That's the speech of someone who's 

1363
01:10:08,931 --> 01:10:12,590
possessed by disgust.
They are not the same thing.

1364
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:17,900
The first of May can only be the 
liberation of the nation spirit from the

1365
01:10:17,901 --> 01:10:18,734
infection of internationalism,
the restoration to health of people's 

1366
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:25,340
against the infection of materialism 
against the Jewish pestilence.

1367
01:10:25,341 --> 01:10:28,040
We must hold a loft,
a flaming ideal,

1368
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:28,963
another purification metaphor.
The restoration to health of our people 

1369
01:10:31,881 --> 01:10:34,900
must start from the restoration to 
health of the body politics.

1370
01:10:34,901 --> 01:10:39,901
So that was Hitler's essential metaphor.
The the nation was a body,

1371
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:42,740
right?
It was a pure body,

1372
01:10:42,741 --> 01:10:43,574
it was a pure area in body,
and it was being assaulted by parasites 

1373
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:51,920
that were subjecting it to disease and 
decay.

1374
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:55,310
That's the fundamental metaphor at the 
bottom of his political message.

1375
01:10:56,030 --> 01:11:00,350
I gave the order to burn burned down to 
the raw flesh.

1376
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:01,213
Jesus,
the ulcers have this poisoning of the 

1377
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:04,310
wealth.
Yeah,

1378
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,233
pretty rough man.
This is the battle against a veritable 

1379
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:09,764
world sickness which threatens to infect
the people's a plague which devastates 

1380
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,033
peoples and international pestilence.
The international carry of the Bacillus 

1381
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:20,850
must be fought.
It is if within this community,

1382
01:11:20,851 --> 01:11:21,684
one state is infected,
that infection is decisive for all in 

1383
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,573
European Europe,
no common life of the nations is 

1384
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:29,184
possible when amongst their number.
There are some who are suffering from a 

1385
01:11:32,311 --> 01:11:35,970
poisonous infection and who openly 
preserved profess their desire to infect

1386
01:11:35,971 --> 01:11:36,804
others with the same disease.
We shall have a very real interest in 

1387
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:43,650
seeing to it that the bolshevist plague 
does not spread over Europe.

1388
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:44,963
National Socialism has made our people 
and therefore the right immune from a 

1389
01:11:49,111 --> 01:11:50,370
Bolshevik infection.

1390
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:53,880
I'll read you one more,
although obviously you get the point.

1391
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:57,390
Table seven is called the national body 
is being consumed.

1392
01:11:58,530 --> 01:12:00,660
The Jew is and remains the typical 
parasite,

1393
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:03,360
a sponger who likes to know like a 
noxious bacillus,

1394
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:06,510
keeps spreading as soon as a favorable 
medium invites him.

1395
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:10,170
Alright,
now I want to show you a brief film

1396
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,580
and you can.
You can look here at at the,

1397
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:16,613
what would you call it?
Artistic and propaganda stick 

1398
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:22,290
transformation of the idea of order into
a politicized message.

1399
01:12:22,291 --> 01:12:23,124
And the thing that's so interesting 
about Hitler's particular brand of 

1400
01:12:25,291 --> 01:12:28,920
fascism,
it wasn't precisely and it see it wasn't

1401
01:12:28,921 --> 01:12:32,670
precisely a movement that was predicated
on ideas like communism.

1402
01:12:32,671 --> 01:12:36,220
Communism is predicated on ideas,
but the Nazis went out.

1403
01:12:36,221 --> 01:12:38,430
It was something that wasn't really in 
the realm of idea.

1404
01:12:38,431 --> 01:12:41,520
It was more in the realm of embodied,
discussed and the image,

1405
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:44,430
and so it was also very much more 
difficult to fight against.

1406
01:12:44,431 --> 01:12:46,770
From the ideational perspective.
You know,

1407
01:12:46,771 --> 01:12:49,530
it wasn't a well developed intellectual 
movement.

1408
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:50,543
It was an embodied movement and Hitler 
was extraordinarily good at using the 

1409
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,104
metaphors and the images and then his 
incredible capacity for for propaganda 

1410
01:12:59,521 --> 01:13:00,354
stick display to fire people up at a 
level of analysis that they weren't 

1411
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:06,510
really even aware of,
so let's take a look at this film

1412
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:21,730
campaign then gave us the opportunity to
really get to know the Jewish people.

1413
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:31,950
Nearly 4 million Jews live here in 
Poland,

1414
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:35,580
but they won't be found among the rural 
population,

1415
01:14:36,450 --> 01:14:39,940
nor have they suffered from the chaos of
war as has the native pole.

1416
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:44,550
They set it out in differently in the 
gloomy streets and the Polish ghetto

1417
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:50,880
within an hour after the German 
occupation.

1418
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:52,073
They were back in business,
German and his head to look at the 

1419
01:15:15,051 --> 01:15:18,350
Polish ghetto 25 years ago.
This time,

1420
01:15:18,351 --> 01:15:22,010
our eyes are sharpened by our experience
in the last few decades.

1421
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:22,983
Yeah,

1422
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:28,030
I'm lucky.
In 1914,

1423
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:29,013
we no longer see just the most grotesque
and chemical of these questionable 

1424
01:15:32,951 --> 01:15:33,784
ghetto figures.
This time we recognize that there's a 

1425
01:15:36,251 --> 01:15:37,084
plague here,
a plague that threatens the health of 

1426
01:15:40,121 --> 01:15:45,000
the Aryan peoples.
Once said,

1427
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,820
the Jew is the demon behind the 
corruption of mankind.

1428
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:56,620
These pictures prove it.
Jewish home life reveals remarkable lack

1429
01:16:22,631 --> 01:16:27,631
of creative ability to civilize
in plain language.

1430
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,970
Jewish dwellings are filthy and 
neglected

1431
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:43,840
bidding on it all.
Poor after decades of business,

1432
01:16:44,110 --> 01:16:47,590
they've hoarded enough to acquire a 
decent comfortable home,

1433
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:56,040
but they live for generations in the 
same dirty and bug or written dwellings.

1434
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:05,600
No,
I'm troubled by their surroundings.

1435
01:17:05,601 --> 01:17:09,950
They go right on with their prayers
depending on the vehicle.

1436
01:17:10,090 --> 01:17:15,090
And the rubbing motion is part of the 
ritual for reading Jewish scripture.

1437
01:17:15,281 --> 01:17:20,281
Yeah.
Yeah.

1438
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:28,660
How part of Jewish so-called community 
life even takes place in the street.

1439
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:51,560
The connection with trade,
you know,

1440
01:17:51,561 --> 01:17:53,960
you see what's going on in that.
Okay.

1441
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:56,450
So what's the juxtaposition of those two
films?

1442
01:17:56,451 --> 01:18:00,560
You see?
The juxtaposition of order versus chaos.

1443
01:18:00,561 --> 01:18:04,100
And so part of the order versus chaos 
archetype obviously is,

1444
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:08,120
is rooted in the dichotomy between 
disgust and purity.

1445
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,073
It's not the only,
not the only access of our opposition 

1446
01:18:11,961 --> 01:18:12,794
between order and chaos.
And then so this is all invocation of 

1447
01:18:16,941 --> 01:18:21,941
archetipal chaos and it starts with the 
use of the disease imagery.

1448
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:28,210
And then also the use of music composed 
in a minor key and threatening and low,

1449
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:29,953
right?
So that's all juxtaposed together and 

1450
01:18:31,971 --> 01:18:32,804
then they switched to trade again with 
this undertone of threat and there's a 

1451
01:18:36,321 --> 01:18:39,270
hand to hand exchange of goods and it 
seems to me that they're,

1452
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:44,600
they're using the image to continue the 
metaphor that in this situation trade is

1453
01:18:44,601 --> 01:18:47,540
associated with contamination rather 
than productivity.

1454
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,433
Right?
And so you and you can see obviously a 

1455
01:18:50,991 --> 01:18:51,824
dichotomy with regards to trade because 
when you're taking goods from someone 

1456
01:18:54,531 --> 01:18:55,460
else,
the question is,

1457
01:18:55,461 --> 01:18:57,560
are the goods of high quality and useful
or,

1458
01:18:57,790 --> 01:18:58,623
and are they useful?
Are they something that is going to 

1459
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:00,734
introduce a foreign element or,
or an unexpected element into your 

1460
01:19:04,011 --> 01:19:07,840
house.
And so this film is obviously taking the

1461
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:09,583
ambivalence that's associated with trade
and placing it into the chaos order 

1462
01:19:14,391 --> 01:19:16,730
archetype and then associating it with 
disgust.

1463
01:19:16,731 --> 01:19:19,640
So it's very,
very sneaky and it's not done.

1464
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:22,940
It's done by inference rather than 
directly,

1465
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:25,520
which I think is much more powerful way 
of doing this sort of thing.

1466
01:19:49,830 --> 01:19:52,640
And one of the things that's interesting
too is that you know,

1467
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:56,150
you can imagine that if you're,
if you're seeing people who are poor and

1468
01:19:56,151 --> 01:19:59,840
downtrodden at that might evoke two 
possible sets of responses.

1469
01:19:59,841 --> 01:20:03,050
When might be a compassionate response,
that would be the desire to help,

1470
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:04,293
right?
And the other would be the desire to 

1471
01:20:05,031 --> 01:20:06,650
distance yourself.
Of course,

1472
01:20:06,651 --> 01:20:08,310
you feel the same thing.
For example,

1473
01:20:08,311 --> 01:20:09,144
if you're walking down bloor and you 
find somebody who's completely wreck 

1474
01:20:11,651 --> 01:20:14,820
street person lying there in their 
sleeping bag in a doorway,

1475
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:15,541
it's like,
well,

1476
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:17,910
what's your response going to be?
Is it compassionate or is it.

1477
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:19,950
Is it fear?
Is it disgust?

1478
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:20,963
Well,
it's going to depend on your mood and 

1479
01:20:22,141 --> 01:20:22,974
all sorts of other things.
It's gonna depend on the particulars of 

1480
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:25,404
the situation.
It's going to depend on your 

1481
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:28,890
temperament,
but you can see that those two things,

1482
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:30,143
they're both automatically vocable 
responses and it isn't self evident 

1483
01:20:34,051 --> 01:20:35,520
which one is going to come to the fore.

1484
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:38,250
Nor is it always self evident which one 
should come to the fore.

1485
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:39,084
Because part of the reason that you're 
ambivalent about a situation like that 

1486
01:20:41,581 --> 01:20:42,414
is because you have no idea what would 
happen even if you did choose to 

1487
01:20:44,911 --> 01:20:49,911
interact and so you can't just simply,
what would you say?

1488
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:51,743
There's no simple way of solving a 
problem like that and so that's why 

1489
01:20:54,751 --> 01:20:57,050
there's a war of competing emotions when
you're in a,

1490
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:58,223
when you're in a situation like that,
but you could imagine as well you could 

1491
01:21:00,331 --> 01:21:01,164
have taken the same images and put them 
to different music and used a different 

1492
01:21:03,691 --> 01:21:06,090
overlay and it could have been a call to
compassion,

1493
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:07,223
but that's not what it is here.
It's a call to contempt and 

1494
01:21:09,241 --> 01:21:10,074
extermination
because that's also another danger of I 

1495
01:21:15,301 --> 01:21:20,301
suppose insisting upon the fact that a 
given population is

1496
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:22,103
cool,

1497
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,113
victimized.
I suppose that might be way of one way 

1498
01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:25,754
of thinking about because there's two 
different sets of categorical responses 

1499
01:21:29,121 --> 01:21:29,954
to people who are at the bottom of the 
dominance hierarchy and one of them is 

1500
01:21:32,211 --> 01:21:34,340
compassion,
but the other one is more like this.

1501
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,580
It's not necessarily something that you 
want to carelessly evoke.

1502
01:22:02,170 --> 01:22:06,740
One might want to regard these haggling.
Children as a sign of great poverty,

1503
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:10,653
watch them awhile.
It becomes clear that they're proud to 

1504
01:22:14,331 --> 01:22:15,830
act as their grownups.
Do.

1505
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:18,073
You use young people,
don't have the idealism that ours do 

1506
01:22:21,950 --> 01:22:22,783
with them.
The egoism of the individual is not in 

1507
01:22:25,131 --> 01:22:30,131
the service of higher common goals.
Instead,

1508
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:31,123
Jewish morality.
In kras contradiction of the Aryan 

1509
01:22:33,651 --> 01:22:34,484
concept of ethics proclaims the 
unrestrained egoism of every Jew to be 

1510
01:22:38,211 --> 01:22:39,110
divine.
Law

1511
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:44,810
is religion makes cheating and usury a 
duty.

1512
01:22:47,290 --> 01:22:49,330
In the fifth book of Moses,
for example,

1513
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:53,650
it has stated that a non Jew vow may 
loan to upon usury,

1514
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:58,770
but not my brother.
The Lord may bless thee in all ID lanes

1515
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:07,670
for the Jews.
Then doing business is something holy.

1516
01:23:10,210 --> 01:23:11,043
This is totally incomprehensible.
Did Non Jews Aryan man attaches a sense 

1517
01:23:16,421 --> 01:23:21,250
of worth to every activity he wants to 
create something worthwhile.

1518
01:23:22,350 --> 01:23:25,270
Clothing,
houses or machines.

1519
01:23:26,130 --> 01:23:27,570
Yeah,
so there's a contrast there.

1520
01:23:27,571 --> 01:23:28,404
They actually use a contrast there 
between industrious and non industrious 

1521
01:23:30,991 --> 01:23:32,490
too,
which is quite interesting.

1522
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:33,660
Works of art

1523
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:34,583
or anything else of value to everyone.
He's ruled by the feeling of being 

1524
01:23:39,811 --> 01:23:41,770
responsible for his achievements,
right?

1525
01:24:06,490 --> 01:24:10,470
For the Jew.
One thing of value money,

1526
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,270
oh,
he gets it,

1527
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:17,160
makes no difference.
The first trade goods,

1528
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:22,850
generally worthless trash of all sorts.
That's how the little Jews start out.

1529
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:29,350
So they reached the point where they can
sell from a tray and before long they've

1530
01:24:29,701 --> 01:24:34,701
assembled a complete line of goods,
not long after the owner,

1531
01:24:38,601 --> 01:24:42,020
regular stand,
the most ambitious,

1532
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,990
soon own a small shop,
and then a bigger shop

1533
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:57,170
wouldn't be the most cunning.
That is the most unscrupulous eventually

1534
01:24:57,591 --> 01:24:58,424
have warehouses in banks and move it to 
the most splendid mentions in the city 

1535
01:25:02,061 --> 01:25:02,894
is provided that they don't get in each 
other's way as in the narrow ghettos of 

1536
01:25:07,461 --> 01:25:08,294
the east.
That's why they try to escape to witch 

1537
01:25:18,641 --> 01:25:20,480
lands with rich people.
Right

1538
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:28,830
need.

1539
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:29,663
So when the next part of the film,
there's another something else that's 

1540
01:25:32,251 --> 01:25:33,084
done implicitly.
So you'll see a globe and then their 

1541
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:41,210
spread of of migration and the 
underlying metaphor there is again,

1542
01:25:42,811 --> 01:25:44,040
the spread of disease

1543
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:47,650
peoples because they need the.
Whereas with which to do business

1544
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,633
creative,
Aryan people's find the value has been 

1545
01:25:54,641 --> 01:25:59,641
reduced by the Jew to the mere 
merchandise he buys and sells.

1546
01:26:00,130 --> 01:26:05,130
That produces nothing.
Yeah,

1547
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:10,310
he leaves to the workers and farmers of 
the host nation.

1548
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:12,313
It's funny there.
There's an echo of Marxist ideology in 

1549
01:26:14,001 --> 01:26:14,834
there too.
That's very interesting because what 

1550
01:26:16,191 --> 01:26:17,024
they're there to get the insistence is 
that the Labor that goes into basic 

1551
01:26:23,211 --> 01:26:24,044
production qualifies as Labor,
but the labor that goes into mercantile 

1552
01:26:26,631 --> 01:26:28,460
activity doesn't qualify as Labor at 
all.

1553
01:26:28,461 --> 01:26:29,294
It's not like the Nazis were pro 
capitalist by any stretch of the 

1554
01:26:31,191 --> 01:26:32,024
imagination.
So there's this strange distinction 

1555
01:26:33,891 --> 01:26:36,830
drawn between like it's almost like 
physical production.

1556
01:26:36,831 --> 01:26:38,570
That seems to be something that's 
valued.

1557
01:26:38,571 --> 01:26:39,404
It's the use of your musculature say,
but then as soon as it's elevated up 

1558
01:26:42,501 --> 01:26:43,334
into trade,
which is obviously a value added 

1559
01:26:44,871 --> 01:26:45,900
process,
I mean that.

1560
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:46,743
That's almost self evident,
but it's put forward here as something 

1561
01:26:48,921 --> 01:26:52,440
that's only.
That's only a parasitical that's right.

1562
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:55,460
That and that's commonality with Marxism
of the time.

1563
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:08,010
The Jews are people without farmers or 
workers or race of parasites

1564
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:20,283
in the dark.
Wherever the body of a nation shows a 

1565
01:27:22,931 --> 01:27:23,764
wound,
they anchor themselves and feed on the 

1566
01:27:26,441 --> 01:27:27,274
decaying organism.
They make business out of the sickness 

1567
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:34,930
of the nations,
therefore endeavor to deepen and prolong

1568
01:27:34,931 --> 01:27:38,680
all conditions of sickness.
That's how it is.

1569
01:27:38,681 --> 01:27:39,514
In Poland and was in Germany,
the Jews had been this way throughout 

1570
01:27:45,251 --> 01:27:49,180
their entire history.
Their faces bear the age old features of

1571
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:50,014
the perpetual sponger eternal Jew who in
the course of time on worldwide 

1572
01:27:55,250 --> 01:28:00,250
wonderings has always been the same.
There's no difference between these Jews

1573
01:28:01,571 --> 01:28:02,404
in Poland and those in Palestine,
though the two are geographically 

1574
01:28:06,341 --> 01:28:07,174
separated.
Palestine is the spiritual center of 

1575
01:28:36,371 --> 01:28:38,360
international jewelry.
No,

1576
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:41,080
the Jews are numerically insignificant.
They're

1577
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:44,613
here at the Wailing Wall.
They gather and more in the fall of 

1578
01:28:46,871 --> 01:28:47,704
Jerusalem.

1579
01:28:58,560 --> 01:28:59,393
Homelessness though is a matter of and 
in keeping with their entire history 

1580
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:06,383
4,000 years ago,
their Hebrew ancestors were already 

1581
01:29:09,061 --> 01:29:09,894
wondering out of the land of two rivers,
they wandered along the sea to Egypt 

1582
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:16,133
where they ran a lucrative grain 
business for awhile when the country 

1583
01:29:19,381 --> 01:29:22,530
farmer is and other Egyptians rose 
against the foreign use,

1584
01:29:22,531 --> 01:29:23,364
yours and speculators,
they wondered once more and plundered 

1585
01:29:26,521 --> 01:29:31,320
their way to the promised land.
They settled there mercilessly.

1586
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:34,470
Looting the culturally superior rightful
inhabitants.

1587
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:38,520
Yeah,
and bigger windows here in the course of

1588
01:29:38,521 --> 01:29:43,521
centuries from the oriental far eastern 
racial mixture with negroid admixture,

1589
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:45,083
the ultimate mom realized Jews developed
foreign from us Europeans born of 

1590
01:29:49,681 --> 01:29:50,514
totally different racial elements.
They differ from us in body and above 

1591
01:29:54,451 --> 01:29:55,284
all in Seoul.
We probably would never have been 

1592
01:29:58,841 --> 01:30:01,780
bothered by them had they stayed in 
their oriental home

1593
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:05,253
about the cosmopolitan empire of 
Alexander the great reaching from the 

1594
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:10,273
Near East across half the Mediterranean 
and especially the boundless world 

1595
01:30:13,581 --> 01:30:17,210
empire of the Romans,
brought about the evolution of the trade

1596
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:18,044
and migratory traits of the Jews who 
soon spread across the open 

1597
01:30:21,411 --> 01:30:22,244
Mediterranean area.
While some of them settled in the large 

1598
01:30:24,891 --> 01:30:27,500
urban traffic and trade centers of the 
Mediterranean,

1599
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,520
it could be up on youtube.
I'm doing

1600
01:30:31,810 --> 01:30:35,110
others wandered relentlessly on across 
Spain,

1601
01:30:35,590 --> 01:30:36,423
France,
southern Germany and England and 

1602
01:30:40,090 --> 01:30:44,920
everywhere they made themselves 
unwelcome in Spain and France.

1603
01:30:44,921 --> 01:30:45,754
The people rose openly against them in 
the 13th and 14th centuries and they 

1604
01:30:49,661 --> 01:30:54,661
wandered on mainly to Germany.
Follow the path of the Aryan culture,

1605
01:30:59,190 --> 01:31:00,023
creative Germans colonizing the east.
They finally found the gigantic new 

1606
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:08,400
untapped reservoir in the Polish and 
Russian sections of eastern Europe.

1607
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:12,150
So well let's let's tie that together.

1608
01:31:15,930 --> 01:31:20,460
We talked about the use of archetypes,
archetypes in stories.

1609
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:22,733
We talked about the the relationship 
between archetypal symbolism and the 

1610
01:31:27,601 --> 01:31:29,880
biological underpinnings of the human 
psyche,

1611
01:31:31,170 --> 01:31:35,010
and then you can see that manifesting 
itself in this sort of propaganda in the

1612
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:38,520
political positions that come out of it.
Did he tap into the archetype?

1613
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:42,210
Archetypal dimension?
That's chaos versus order.

1614
01:31:43,010 --> 01:31:43,843
You can.
You can place one against the other 

1615
01:31:45,031 --> 01:31:45,864
however you want from a propaganda 
perspective because you could make a 

1616
01:31:48,511 --> 01:31:52,440
film decrying excessive order that 
that's not a difficult thing to do,

1617
01:31:52,441 --> 01:31:53,274
but that isn't what happened here.
Order is associated with the sun and 

1618
01:31:55,471 --> 01:31:56,304
with what's good and with honest labor 
and with purity and with and chaos is 

1619
01:32:00,461 --> 01:32:05,461
associated with decay and disgust and 
and impurity and also with trade,

1620
01:32:05,621 --> 01:32:08,020
which is extremely interesting and the 
trade dynamic.

1621
01:32:08,021 --> 01:32:10,470
You could see that in the second part of
the film there,

1622
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:11,430
there was a.

1623
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:14,650
There was the implication that it was 
involvement in trade that was associated

1624
01:32:14,651 --> 01:32:16,510
with this pathological spread.
Right,

1625
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:17,623
and so trade ins,
that's another reflection of the 

1626
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:22,540
ambivalence towards the transgression of
borders.

1627
01:32:22,541 --> 01:32:24,190
Is trade a good thing or is it a bad 
thing?

1628
01:32:24,191 --> 01:32:25,540
Well,
that's always a political issue.

1629
01:32:25,541 --> 01:32:27,340
It's a huge political issue right now,
right?

1630
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:29,260
You're going to have internationalist 
trade.

1631
01:32:29,261 --> 01:32:30,094
You're going to close the borders.
You can have internationalist trade and 

1632
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:34,510
open editor.
You're going to close the borders and so

1633
01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:37,090
the degree to which the border should be
open or closed.

1634
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:37,983
I think generally speaking is the prime 
political question and of course we're 

1635
01:32:40,871 --> 01:32:43,540
going through an absolute convulsion of 
that sort of argumentation.

1636
01:32:43,541 --> 01:32:44,374
Again,
right now.

1637
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:47,050
Part of the reason I wanted to show you 
this,

1638
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:49,270
I mean there's a variety of reasons.
I wanted to show you

1639
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:51,903
how the,
how the archetype and the underlying 

1640
01:32:53,921 --> 01:32:54,754
biology are are tightly associated,
but I also wanted to show you how those 

1641
01:32:59,141 --> 01:32:59,974
associations can be hijacked essentially
and used for propagandistic and 

1642
01:33:03,701 --> 01:33:04,534
political purposes because you need to 
know that because these sorts of things 

1643
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,370
have a very powerful.

1644
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:10,353
They have the capacity for a very 
powerful emotional appeal and the only 

1645
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:16,570
possible way of resisting that I would 
say,

1646
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,273
and and avoiding the temptation of 
allowing extraordinarily complex issues 

1647
01:33:21,941 --> 01:33:24,630
to be catastrophic.
We reduced to there too.

1648
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:29,170
Two principals that are far too simple 
to do them justice is to become at least

1649
01:33:29,171 --> 01:33:30,004
aware to some degree of what the 
mechanisms for the production of such 

1650
01:33:33,671 --> 01:33:34,504
propaganda are and why they have such 
potency than you have at least some 

1651
01:33:38,350 --> 01:33:41,860
ghost of a chance of reducing your own.
What would you call it?

1652
01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:43,143
Proclivity.
We could even call it a temperamental 

1653
01:33:44,411 --> 01:33:45,244
proclivity to the kind of propaganda 
stick information that happens to suit 

1654
01:33:48,371 --> 01:33:49,204
your temperament best,
so while we all know the aftermath of 

1655
01:33:52,181 --> 01:33:53,170
this sort of thing,
right?

1656
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:54,093
It was absolutely dreadful and we're by 
no means out of the woods on that yet 

1657
01:33:58,320 --> 01:33:59,153
you see in Europe and in the United 
States increasingly calls for the 

1658
01:34:04,481 --> 01:34:07,420
nationalistic enclosure of borders.
Again,

1659
01:34:07,421 --> 01:34:08,254
you saw that with trump and the building
of the wall between Mexico and the 

1660
01:34:10,990 --> 01:34:11,823
United States,
so these things can get very badly out 

1661
01:34:13,781 --> 01:34:14,614
of hand and it's a.
it's a very bad idea to allow things to 

1662
01:34:17,981 --> 01:34:18,814
swing too far to one way or too far to 
the other because all hell breaks loose 

1663
01:34:21,611 --> 01:34:23,610
when you do that.
Well.

1664
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,680
All right,
we'll see you on Thursday.
