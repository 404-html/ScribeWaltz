1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,613
Hi everybody.
I'm in a little air BNB in Manhattan a 

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,600
few days before this event that I'm 
going to talk to you about.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,490
Um,
I'm here to talk to Jonathan Heit today,

4
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:13,260
so that should be good.
Anyways,

5
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:18,261
I wanted to tell you about an event 
that's coming up on November 11th call,

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,160
the stifling of free speech on 
university campuses and it's going to be

7
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:28,161
held at the Canada Christian College,
which is at 50 Jervais drive in Toronto.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,110
And it'll start at 1:00 PM.
I'm all put all that information.

9
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:34,944
In the description of the video,
we're going to talk about the state of 

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,100
free discussion on campuses.
And uh,

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,993
this event has actually mushrooms into 
something that was far beyond its 

12
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:48,840
original borders,
let's say,

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,710
because of,
because it was scheduled for August 22nd

14
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:55,890
and had been canceled by Ryerson 
University.

15
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:58,710
And I'll tell you why that is as I go 
through this video.

16
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,543
So first of all,
I'm going to tell you who's going to be 

17
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:01,344
there.
So this is actually organized by Ms 

18
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:07,440
Serena Singh,
who's a former social worker and a newly

19
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:09,600
hatched political and social 
commentator.

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,913
You can find out more about her and her 
views and her work at a channel called 

21
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:15,954
recovery social worker on Youtube.
Serena has served as a social worker in 

22
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:22,194
the child welfare system,
which is a really rough place to work 

23
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:27,420
for many,
many years and has been disturbed deeply

24
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,470
about the rising tide of political 
correctness in social work in particular

25
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:35,250
because social work is a discipline 
that's been almost entirely corrupted by

26
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:37,110
in my estimation,
by political correctness.

27
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:37,944
And so because of her concerns,
she decided to speak out and also to 

28
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:43,764
organize this event.
So that's been very challenging as this 

29
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,970
is the first thing of this sort that 
she's done.

30
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,120
So the panelists include doctor 
[inaudible] and doctor or an [inaudible]

31
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,990
and myself.
And I'll tell you,

32
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,850
most of you know about,
uh,

33
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,160
Gad sad I s I presume some of you know 
about doctor Aminay as well.

34
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,970
Give you a little background information
about them.

35
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:03,804
So Dr Sad is a professor at Concordia 
University in Montreal and host of the 

36
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,150
Youtube Channel,
the sad truth.

37
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,520
And he's the author of a couple of 
books.

38
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:14,910
They're consuming instinct and the 
evolutionary basis of consumption.

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,320
And he's also served as the editor of 
evolutionary psychology and the business

40
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:21,390
sciences.
Doctor [inaudible].

41
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,030
Doctor [inaudible] is at clinical 
psychologist,

42
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:27,390
a media consultant and a lecturer at 
Ryerson University in Toronto.

43
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,240
He's host of the podcast,
the real reality.

44
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,990
I actually served on his Phd Defense 
Committee a number of years ago,

45
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:37,710
but a while back he invited me to talk 
to his class at Ryerson University.

46
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:38,544
Uh,
that talk was recorded and was released 

47
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:44,220
as an incendiary discussion at Ryerson 
University.

48
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,443
It's garnered about 400,000 views on 
youtube and I'll put a link to that in 

49
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:50,934
the discussion as well.
And so those are the three people that 

50
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:56,580
are going to be speaking at the panel as
well as me.

51
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,403
The panel discussion was originally for 
our August 22nd but was canceled by 

52
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:04,294
Univer Ryerson University.
So the irony of that was not lost on us 

53
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:08,314
because what that meant was that there 
was a panel on the suppression of free 

54
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:16,360
speech at university campuses that was 
actually canceled by a university.

55
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:17,830
So,
but that's only,

56
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,783
you know,
that's just an example of all the odd 

57
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:22,330
things that have been happening 
everywhere recently.

58
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:23,180
I would say,
uh,

59
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,783
administrators,
their quote prioritize safety unquote 

60
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:28,234
over free speech in light of recent 
events and they were referring to the 

61
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,480
Charlottesville meeting and the tragedy 
that occurred there.

62
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,940
I guess they had their reasons to be 
concerned.

63
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,590
The BBC covered the cancellation,
uh,

64
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,533
and quoted the administrators who were 
responsible for the cancellation as 

65
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:46,810
follows.
There is often attention at universities

66
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:50,500
resulting from our commitment to be a 
place for free speech and our commitment

67
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:53,020
to be a place that is civil,
safe and welcoming.

68
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,123
In light of recent events,
Ryerson University is prioritizing 

69
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:59,860
campus safety said university 
spokesperson,

70
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:04,390
Michael Forbes and an email Mr. Forbes 
said a part time instructor had rented a

71
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:05,224
room on campus to host the event.
But after conducting a standard safety 

72
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:08,854
review,
the university decided that quote 

73
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,350
Ryerson is not equipped to provide the 
necessary level of public safety for the

74
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:16,330
event to go forward.
Well,

75
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,283
you can make of that what you will.
I think that Ryerson who had agreed to 

76
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:21,544
host the talk could have decided that 
long before one or two days before the 

77
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:28,060
event.
But in any case it was canceled.

78
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,893
We would have got about two or 300 
people at the event if it would've gone 

79
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:33,094
forward in Ryerson.
And there was some organized opposition 

80
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,783
to the event,
which basically claimed that it was 

81
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:40,770
being run by Nazis.
It neonazis a,

82
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,390
that was actually what they posted on 
their facebook site,

83
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,750
although they took that down after it 
became publicized at,

84
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:50,230
that was the sort of symbolism that they
were using to object to the event.

85
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:54,970
And then in the aftermath of their 
successful campaign to have Ryerson shut

86
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:55,804
it down,
which involve multiple phone calls to 

87
00:04:57,521 --> 00:05:02,521
the administrators and so forth.
They scheduled a post cancellation rally

88
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,880
where about a hundred or so might've 
been up to 200 people,

89
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:11,590
came out at Ryerson and uh,
had a celebration party,

90
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,873
well waving around banners that 
prominently displayed the hammer and 

91
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:17,314
sickle.
So that gives you some idea of who is 

92
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:22,330
behind this.
And then later the same people shut down

93
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:24,120
a comedy event,
uh,

94
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,323
which was entitled something 
approximating a free speech comedy 

95
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:28,060
event.

96
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,000
And that was rescheduled as well for 
November 4th,

97
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:33,640
which I think is two days ago.
I think it's the sixth today.

98
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,970
Yeah.
And they disrupted that as well.

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,833
So we expect some level of disruption at
the November 11th event and are 

100
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,453
organizing security to minimize the 
probability that it will be either 

101
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:47,044
disrupted or shut down.
But you never know what's going to 

102
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:52,390
happen.
We've sold about 950 tickets so far.

103
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,970
Um,
the other thing that happened recently,

104
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:55,804
and I think this is a good indication of
the kind of opposition that we're going 

105
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:04,790
to be facing as that my neighborhood was
postered with uh,

106
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,840
a number of posters claiming that I was 
a risk to the,

107
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,810
to the neighborhood.
Uh,

108
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,803
I think they were entitled a community 
safety warning describing me as a well 

109
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:19,430
as a reprehensible person.
And funnily enough,

110
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,413
the photograph they used with of meat,
which was actually one where I appear 

111
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,420
quite angry,
was taken from a free speech rally where

112
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:27,254
the same sort of people showed up in 
opposition and they took the microphone 

113
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,750
and shut down the PA system and blasted 
white noise.

114
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,583
So in order to make myself heard,
I had to speak very loudly and that's 

115
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:44,450
the picture they took to indicate what a
public safety menace I am.

116
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,583
So anyways,
that's the sort of people that are 

117
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,040
opposing this.
So I'm encouraging you to buy tickets or

118
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,443
you can get them at Brown paper tickets.
I'll put the link in the video 

119
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:57,490
description.
Uh,

120
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,603
I would also say though,
if you're planning to come and your an 

121
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:04,244
advocate for the sort of thing that I've
been doing and doctor [inaudible] and 

122
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:09,224
doctor sad and Serena as well.
I really would like to emphasize the 

123
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:18,200
necessary necessity for calm and,
and detachment.

124
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,440
And there's going to be,
if the protesters are there,

125
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,274
I suspect there'll be quite provocative.
I wouldn't put it past them to plant 

126
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,830
provocateurs in,
in the crowd to cause trouble.

127
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,853
And the last thing I want on any of us 
on the panel want is for anybody to be 

128
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:40,490
hurt or for anything stupid to happen.

129
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,930
Um,
you know,

130
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:44,330
disruptions are one thing and we 
certainly don't want them,

131
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,164
but we don't want anyone hurt.
And I would like to implore all of you 

132
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:50,720
who are coming to support us,
who were,

133
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:51,554
who were just interested in this issue 
to maintain your cool regardless of 

134
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:57,134
level of provocation.
It's unbelievably important because in 

135
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,800
the social media climate that we have 
right now,

136
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:09,130
the misbehavior of any single individual
has ramifications that can echo far past

137
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,063
what would normally be the case.
And so it's of extreme importance for 

138
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:19,214
everyone who's in favor of let's say 
free speech and in favor of supporting 

139
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,280
the endeavors that,
that a number of people are,

140
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,323
are uh,
engaged in to sure that free speech 

141
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:43,121
remains a priority in our society and on
campuses that no one behaves badly.

142
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,800
Uh,
again,

143
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:48,770
regardless of provocation,
keep your damn cool,

144
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,690
okay.
Because it's really important.

145
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:51,643
It's crucially important.
We have good security as far as I can 

146
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:55,514
tell,
done our best to vet them and all of 

147
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:58,200
that.
But um,

148
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,813
this is,
this just isn't the time or place for 

149
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,050
anything untoward to happen.
So anyways,

150
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:09,360
we'd like to invite you to come.
You can get tickets.

151
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:13,620
As I said at Brown paper tickets,
I'll post that.

152
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:16,140
There's still,
the venue is somewhat expandable.

153
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:18,840
So although we've sold approximately a 
thousand tickets,

154
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:19,674
which is of course it's about five times
as many people as we would have 

155
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:22,884
originally talked to.
That's pretty funny too because you 

156
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:25,464
know,
this is another reason to maintain calm 

157
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:30,960
is just because the protesters show up 
and even if they caused trouble,

158
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,940
that doesn't mean that they're obtaining
any more than a local trivial victory.

159
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,163
Um,
the medium term and long term 

160
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:40,104
consequences of them shutting us down at
Ryerson is that we're going to talk to 

161
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:46,320
five times as many people at the Canada 
Christian College.

162
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,290
The reason we picked the Canada 
Christian college just because,

163
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,240
well,
first of all it was a large venue,

164
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,850
but more importantly,
um,

165
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,713
we believe that there they,
the people who run the college would 

166
00:09:58,141 --> 00:09:58,974
have enough courage to withstand 
pressure from activist types who mount 

167
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:06,570
phone call,
uh,

168
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,470
uh,
campaigns to have this shutdown and that

169
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:12,060
they wouldn't shut it down no matter 
what.

170
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,760
And that's definitely proved to be the 
case.

171
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:15,594
So thank you very much to the people at 
the Canada Christian College for having 

172
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:21,240
the courage to host this.
To begin with.

173
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:23,040
And also the courage not to shut it 
down.

174
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:28,470
So I'm also going to link in the 
description of this video,

175
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,663
a number of the news stories that were 
published in Canada and to some degree 

176
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:35,540
internationally about the original 
shutdown.

177
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,070
So anyways,
I'd like to invite you to come.

178
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,610
It should be an interesting event.
A Gad and Orrin are good speakers there.

179
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,010
Well-Informed.
Serena has a variety of very interesting

180
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:49,170
questions.
Ready for the panel discussion.

181
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,220
I think it could be an excellent event 
and hopefully it will go smoothly.

182
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,413
And even if it doesn't,
hopefully people will have enough sense 

183
00:10:57,781 --> 00:10:58,614
to maintain their cool and react 
intelligently and not respond to 

184
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:07,581
provocation because that's the best way 
forward in this particular situation.

185
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,373
So,
uh,

186
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,220
thanks very much.
