1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,280
Thank you ms Dot Peterson for being with
us.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,970
Thanks for the invitation.
Yeah.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,383
Uh,
what I found most interesting in your 

4
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:14,690
book is the stuff you write about child 
development and child upbringing and for

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,533
example,
you explain how overprotective parents 

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,220
contaminants that are children who,
um,

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,490
you say it's far better to run beings in
your care,

8
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:25,020
competent on,
to protect them.

9
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,123
Do you think that parents today are more
protective of their children than 

10
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:35,010
previous generations?
I would say that it looks like that.

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,873
Yes.
I think there are complex reasons for 

12
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:38,094
that.
I don't think that you can necessarily 

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,063
lay that at the feet of the parents.
People are having fewer children and 

14
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:49,440
they're having them later in life.
And so I think both of those things,

15
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:50,274
those are major demographic shifts and I
think that one of the consequences of 

16
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:56,760
that is the children's lives are much 
more organized than they used to be,

17
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,300
which might have some advantages,
but that also parents are more likely to

18
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:01,134
overprotect they're older and more 
cautious and the children also don't 

19
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:05,934
have as many siblings and of course 
siblings were part of the child raising 

20
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:09,750
process.

21
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,583
And,
and it's hard to be over protected in 

22
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:15,420
some ways when you're competing with a 
bunch of siblings.

23
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,643
So it's complicated.
But I think that overprotection is a 

24
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:23,670
problem.
Room 11 is to not politics when they are

25
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:26,460
skateboarding.
This is a recurring theme in your book.

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,013
Um,
if we are over protective with our 

27
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:30,774
children,
we will create weak individuals while 

28
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,790
you demolish people's resilience that 
way,

29
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:40,170
I mean life is difficult and you cannot 
protect your children.

30
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,783
What you can do is prepare them and you 
can prepare them to be strong and 

31
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:45,594
courageous and truthful and resilient 
and reciprocal in their interactions 

32
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:51,384
with other people.
And that means you equip them for what 

33
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:54,894
life will be,
which is at minimum a series of 

34
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:58,050
difficult challenges.
And,

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,450
and often more than that because of 
course,

36
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:05,310
people go through very difficult times 
in their lives and a resilient person is

37
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:10,311
capable of standing up to things in the 
face of fear and moving forward,

38
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:16,010
voluntarily convinced of their own 
competence and ability to prevail.

39
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,190
And so the primary,
your primary goal as a parent,

40
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:24,360
apart from facilitating your child's 
social desirability,

41
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:27,420
which is a major obligation on your 
part,

42
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,283
is to encourage your children into.
And I mean that literally to instill in 

43
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:32,934
them a sense of courage in the face of 
the difficulties of life and not to 

44
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:37,164
protect them from that,
we don't even want to be protected from 

45
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:44,631
those difficulties because a major part 
of life and its meaning is the,

46
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,390
the challenge that comes with 
confronting difficulties.

47
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,050
So yeah.
What do you want to say to those parents

48
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,973
that allow their eight or nine year old 
sons to sleep in their beds at night 

49
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,910
instead of sleeping in their own rooms?
Well,

50
00:02:58,911 --> 00:02:59,744
I.
The first thing I would say about that 

51
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:05,290
is you might want to ask why you don't 
want privacy with your spouse.

52
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,633
You know,
the last thing you want to do is use 

53
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:12,640
your child as an excuse to not interact 
properly with your wife or your husband.

54
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,113
There's all sorts of reasons that people
allow their children to interfere with 

55
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:20,470
their relationship.
And so and by eight or nine,

56
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,693
a child is more than capable of spending
time on their own and they need to do 

57
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:25,954
that anyways because you don't want your
child to be either unable to spend time 

58
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:30,694
alone or terrified debit you.
You also destroyed to some degree their 

59
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,280
while,
their ability to cope on their own,

60
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:40,870
but also their imagination by not 
requiring them to rely on themselves for

61
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:45,550
their own like co two for self calming 
and safe.

62
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,443
And also for self amusement.
There's a rule when you're dealing with 

63
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:53,770
people who might be dependent,
and this includes includes the situation

64
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:56,230
where you're dealing with sick people or
or elderly people,

65
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:57,064
and the rule is do not do anything for 
anyone that they can do for themselves 

66
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,430
because you take away their competence.

67
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,263
By doing that.
I want to ask you about the use of 

68
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:08,044
physical force on children because you 
think it is important to allow kids to 

69
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:13,360
explore and harm themselves,
to get experience.

70
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,390
Stiller,
belief,

71
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,223
strict parenting is important and you 
think it is justifiable to flick the 

72
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:21,550
index finger to certain types of two 
year olds.

73
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,170
Why use the use of force justifiable in 
the bulletin change on the context,

74
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:28,090
and it also depends on what you mean by 
force.

75
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,163
There isn't a disciplinary strategy that
you can utilize that doesn't involve 

76
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,110
something that's unpleasant while you 
can use reward,

77
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,153
but that that's a different.
There's different circumstances under 

78
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:41,230
way and you should use reward every time
you can because it's more effective,

79
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:42,064
but you often need something that's 
instantaneous and that gets the message 

80
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:46,954
across.
And a flick is a very good technique 

81
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,850
because it's instant,
it's harmless,

82
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,260
it gets the message across.

83
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,320
You can use it publicly,
it can't be misused,

84
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,940
you won't hurt the child.
Um,

85
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,803
you'd have to have an effective 
disciplinary strategy for you since in 

86
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:05,290
social situations.
For example,

87
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,170
you talked about the minimizing 
minimums.

88
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,173
Yeah.
Well the basic rules are quite 

89
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,943
straightforward.
Minimum number of rules because 

90
00:05:12,611 --> 00:05:17,380
otherwise the enforcement costs accrue 
and you end up constraining yourself and

91
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:20,500
the child too much and then minimal 
necessary force.

92
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:21,340
And you might ask,
well,

93
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:24,460
what's minimal necessary force?
And the answer to that is,

94
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,003
um,
minimum intervention necessary to bring 

95
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,590
the behavior to a halt as rapidly.
And harmlessly as possible,

96
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,483
and that has to be negotiated with the 
child because some children are much 

97
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,850
more difficult to stop than others,
but isn't the political divide.

98
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,080
The Pot and child relationship can be 
diamonds.

99
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,310
If basic trust and safety is lost or 
it's absolutely the case that it's,

100
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,840
it will be damaged,
yes,

101
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,883
but the application of judicious 
disciplinary force doesn't damage the 

102
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:52,810
relationship.

103
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,000
It actually strengthens it and everyone 
knows this.

104
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,163
Look,
if if you have a relationship with your 

105
00:05:58,881 --> 00:05:59,714
wife,
let's say the relationship is partly 

106
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,470
based on mutual respect,
not merely on mutual love,

107
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,260
it's also based on mutual respect and 
you.

108
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,573
Everyone tests out there partner to 
determine what their limits are and if 

109
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:18,890
you're not some subject to corrective 
action on the part of your partner,

110
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,173
you will have no respect for them.
Your relationship will deteriorate very 

111
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:23,594
rapidly,
so it's very important to understand 

112
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:27,074
that the limits that you place on 
children are not something that impede 

113
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:34,040
the child parent relationship,
but actually further it substantially.

114
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,390
I want to talk about John Three quality 
now and chapter 11.

115
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:39,224
You write the ball,
the soul called oppression of the 

116
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:41,894
patriarchy and you ride it loose to me 
like the sole colt oppression or the 

117
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:46,290
patriarchy,
awesome.

118
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:47,124
Start on imperfect collective attempt by
men and women stretching over millennia 

119
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,284
to free each,
all different providers and disease and 

120
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,610
so the oppression of women happened 
because it was practical.

121
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,700
No,
the the,

122
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,543
the oppression of men and women happened
because life is difficult and 

123
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:05,324
treacherous and so we were subject and 
still are to all sorts of terrible 

124
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:12,230
burdens that are intrinsic to life 
itself in.

125
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,333
One of the things that's happened is 
because we're so technically in 

126
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:16,964
materially wealthy right now,
we don't understand what privations our 

127
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,450
ancestors even a few generations ago 
faced.

128
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,570
I mean it was very difficult for women 
to function,

129
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,670
let's say,
as as technical equals in the absence of

130
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:35,750
reliable control of menstruation.
That's only been a reality for say,

131
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:36,584
70 years and the birth control pill as 
well as a major technological 

132
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:42,620
revolution.
You mentioned technological advancement.

133
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,513
Yes.
So you hotels have been removed in 

134
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:46,664
particular,
but you talk about the shoal cult 

135
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:52,280
oppression of the patriarchy that women 
were oppressed for centuries.

136
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:52,731
I mean,
well,

137
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:53,564
that's one way of looking at it.
The other way of looking at it is that 

138
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:57,860
men and women were oppressed for 
centuries.

139
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,053
I mean,
there are certain burdens that women 

140
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:03,440
bore that men didn't bear,
but the opposite is equally true.

141
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,910
Yeah,
but in suffered dreadfully,

142
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:08,000
for example,
in incredibly dangerous occupations,

143
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,220
but it's the fact that women suffered 
more than than men.

144
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,540
I don't believe that.
No one.

145
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,374
I don't think it is a fact.
I think that most people suffered by 

146
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:17,960
modern standards,
it measurably,

147
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,310
and that I don't buy the historical 
narrative,

148
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:23,144
that the fundamental reality of our 
history was that men were oppressing 

149
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:27,171
women.
First of all,

150
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:30,110
women aren't that easy to oppress.
As you might've noticed,

151
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:33,710
if you've ever had a relationship with 
them and you might say,

152
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:34,544
well,
it took women a long time to struggle 

153
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:38,810
forward until they attained civil rights
status.

154
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:41,090
That was equivalent to men and I would 
say that's true,

155
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:41,924
but it also was the case for men that it
took very long time to struggle forward 

156
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:46,514
before there was anything approximating 
individual rights and that they were 

157
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:53,150
granted to women quite rapidly in the 
aftermath of that and that a lot of that

158
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:53,984
was a consequence of technological 
transformation that made that sort of 

159
00:08:57,661 --> 00:09:00,510
thing even possible,
but we are both privileged.

160
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,290
White males can be really understand the
suffering of women.

161
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,720
Well,
it depends on how.

162
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,750
How useful your your capacity for 
understanding the suffering of others is

163
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,773
or how well developed that is.
I don't see that it's necessarily any 

164
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:18,450
more difficult to understand the 
suffering of women.

165
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:20,310
Well,
I would never pose the question that way

166
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:21,144
because I don't know how you understand 
the suffering of a group being an 

167
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:27,060
individual.
I don't think a woman can understand the

168
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:29,460
suffering of women because that makes 
the.

169
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,353
That's predicated on the assumption that
an individual can take on the burden of 

170
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:35,790
a group and I don't buy that assumption 
to begin with.

171
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,960
I think we.
We very in the ability to,

172
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,120
let's say,
empathize with others,

173
00:09:42,121 --> 00:09:42,954
but I don't think there's any evidence 
whatsoever that you can't empathize 

174
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:46,674
across a gender barrier.
Otherwise no relationship would even be 

175
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,374
possible.
A lot of people aren't given the 

176
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,370
cultural oppression is still a fact in 
modern society.

177
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,690
Uh,
for example,

178
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:57,540
something feminine is Conservative and 
shopping.

179
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,000
Doesn't that sustain the oppression of 
women?

180
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,643
Well,
I think that there are negative 

181
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,493
stereotypes associated with both forms 
of gendered behavior and that if those 

182
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:09,264
are utilized inappropriately,
they can result in prejudicial 

183
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:13,734
attitudes.
I think that most enterprises are 

184
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,030
imperfect enough so that some residual 
prejudice remains.

185
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,223
It might be sex,
it might be preferenced by gender or 

186
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,240
prejudice by gender,
might be prejudice by race,

187
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,403
might be prejudice by ethnicity or,
or attractiveness or intelligence or 

188
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:32,514
character.
There's all sorts of things that warp 

189
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,023
the proper subjectivity of hierarchies,
but I think we're doing an unbelievably 

190
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:41,904
good job at getting rid of those as 
rapidly as is humanly possible and that 

191
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:45,474
we've moved so fast in that direction so
quickly that we deserve some credit for 

192
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:49,680
it.
There's,

193
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,593
there's one line in the book,
would you say you don't agree with the 

194
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,780
theory of the Feminist Revolution of the
20th century,

195
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:55,614
but it's not the fact that the feminist 
movement of the 20th century had a 

196
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,330
significant impact for gender equality?

197
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,620
No,
I don't really think so.

198
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,680
What I will see my thing was equal pay.
What about,

199
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,390
oh,
what happened in the sixties?

200
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,330
I think that I think that to,
to lay that to the,

201
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,193
to attribute that primarily to the 
feminist political movement is to give 

202
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:18,474
far more credit to the feminist 
political movement than it deserves and 

203
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:24,120
I think the people who are pushing that 
are primarily feminists.

204
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,163
I think that most of what freed women 
was the extension of the idea of 

205
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:30,564
individual rights to everyone,
including women and that that was 

206
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:37,050
happening not only on the on the front 
of women let's say,

207
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:40,950
but also with regards to people of 
different races and ethnicities.

208
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,933
I think it's part of a much broader 
cultural movement to extend the idea of 

209
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:45,774
individual rights universally.
I think that's deeply embedded in the 

210
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:49,464
Judeo Christian tradition and I think 
that a very large number of 

211
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:54,034
technological innovations played a far 
more important role in the emancipation 

212
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:57,700
of women.

213
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,533
Then feminist political ideology,
even though you can point to certain 

214
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,750
movements like the suffragette movement 
for example,

215
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:07,360
that pushed hard to have the vote 
extended to women,

216
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,673
but even that I would say it was a 
manifestation of deeper transformations 

217
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:13,624
at a cultural and technological level.
I think the people who are pushing the 

218
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:18,184
idea that it was the feminist,
it was feminist political machinations 

219
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:22,564
that produced the equalization of the 
situation between men and women are 

220
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:28,780
mostly diehard ideological feminists who
like to think that way,

221
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:29,614
but it doesn't look to me like that's a 
valid historical interpretation in the 

222
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,240
least.
I would like to move on now.

223
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,330
I would like talk like to talk about 
truthfulness in chapter eight on rule.

224
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,930
If you write about the law,
the lifeline,

225
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,693
it's a.
You say someone living in lifeline is 

226
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:45,484
attempting to manipulate reality with 
perception based on what you write into 

227
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:50,164
the chapter.

228
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:51,803
Want to say that a large part of the 
population in 21st century live a life 

229
00:12:57,461 --> 00:12:58,294
flight because they avoid conflict.
They say what they think pleases to 

230
00:13:00,811 --> 00:13:03,910
their spouses or their bosses instead of
telling the truth.

231
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,983
Oh yes,
they do what is convenient at every 

232
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:09,160
given moment.
Instead of saying what they really want.

233
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,260
Yes.
Well perhaps not at every given moment,

234
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:13,750
but they certainly fall prey to that 
temptation.

235
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,250
It's conflict avoidance.
Yeah.

236
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,530
Well,
as a psychologist,

237
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,960
psychologists deal with a variety of 
problems,

238
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:20,794
but I would say the two most common 
normal problems are anxiety and 

239
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:25,804
depression.
That would be one class and the other 

240
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:31,750
would be lack of assertiveness and lack 
of assertiveness.

241
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:35,170
Subsumes the the problems that you just 
described.

242
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,543
People won't stand up for themselves and
say what they need and want and then 

243
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:43,810
they don't negotiate properly and you 
might and they're avoiding.

244
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,640
They're avoiding conflict in the short 
term,

245
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,503
which is a form of lie by omission,
and what that means is that problems 

246
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,860
aggregate around them.
That's often why people end up divorced.

247
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,860
You know,
people will stay married for a long time

248
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:59,500
and one partner will say to the other,
eventually,

249
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,350
we'll I've been unhappy for the last 
eight years.

250
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,550
It's like,
well,

251
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,690
that might have been something to 
announce in increments,

252
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,273
say weekly or even daily,
long before everything accrued to the 

253
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:16,690
point where the only possible solution 
is a catastrophic disillusion.

254
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,560
There's a lot of conflict involved in 
setting a relationship straight.

255
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,740
You have to let each other know who you 
are and because you're different,

256
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:27,400
that's going to cause conflict.
You're going to conflict about whose job

257
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:29,950
takes priority and when you're going to 
see conflict,

258
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,440
have conflict about how to spend your 
free time,

259
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:36,220
but how to raise your children about how
to manage the domestic economy,

260
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,120
about what disciplinary strategies you 
should use about where to vacation,

261
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:41,080
about what to eat.

262
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,040
Like all of those things have to be 
negotiated through.

263
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,670
And all of that requires truthfulness so
that each of you know what the other is,

264
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,840
wants and will be with and conflict.
It's very,

265
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:55,190
very,
uh,

266
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,893
what would you say?
The only thing more exhausting than 

267
00:14:58,671 --> 00:14:59,504
telling the truth and negotiating with 
your spouse is not doing it and waiting 

268
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:06,260
for the divorce.
Both of them are difficult,

269
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,260
but I would recommend the former.
Yeah.

270
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,740
If we talk about the workplace,
what do you want to say to those viewers

271
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:14,810
that the regularly,
you know,

272
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,330
agree with her bosses instead of telling
the truth,

273
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,730
what am I doing to themselves in the 
long run?

274
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,043
Well,
they're taking the soul out of their 

275
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:23,360
work.
You know,

276
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:24,860
let's say,
well,

277
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:25,694
just imagine for the sake of argument 
that you encounter one annoying thing a 

278
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:30,944
day at work,
small annoying thing and then let's say 

279
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,753
for the sake of argument that you could 
have a little battle about that and 

280
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,140
improve it somewhat.

281
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,873
Or You could just say it doesn't matter.
It's like probably doesn't matter today 

282
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:44,744
or it might not even matter tomorrow,
but if you make a thousand decisions 

283
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:49,790
like that,
which you will do over three years,

284
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,953
then now you have a thousand things 
bugging you at work and if you wait for 

285
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,244
five years then it's,
well then it's 2000 things and the same 

286
00:15:57,861 --> 00:16:00,860
thing happens with your kids and the 
same thing happens in your marriage.

287
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,860
Those things accrue and they turn into a
monster,

288
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,520
but you would agree the conflict 
avoidance is practical.

289
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,180
Sometimes people just go on with.
No,

290
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:13,760
I don't actually.
I think in a marriage for example,

291
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:16,130
there's almost nothing so small.
You shouldn't fight about it,

292
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,860
but the question is what does flight 
mean?

293
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,973
It doesn't mean when,
like if if you and I have a 

294
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:24,830
relationship,
let's say it's a business partnership,

295
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:29,831
it doesn't really matter if we have a 
relationship and we have a difference of

296
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:32,270
opinion,
we need to battle it through,

297
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,373
but the purpose of the battle isn't so 
that your viewpoint prevails or that my 

298
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,230
viewpoint prevails because either of us 
might be wrong.

299
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:44,330
The purpose is to engage in the conflict
jewel exchange of opinion so that we can

300
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:47,930
see a joint path forward to peace and 
that's,

301
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,600
and that's the thing is like if you're 
fighting with your wife,

302
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,463
the first thing to remember if you're 
fighting with your wife is you have to 

303
00:16:53,841 --> 00:16:54,674
live with her,
so maybe beating her in the argument is 

304
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:01,490
not the right outcome.
What the right outcome is is saying what

305
00:17:01,491 --> 00:17:05,390
you have to say,
listening to what she has to say and see

306
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:06,224
if you guys can come up with a mutually 
agreed upon solution that will make the 

307
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:09,674
problem go away.
So if we explored conversation between 

308
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:15,600
people in society,
if you.

309
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:16,883
I'll also,
these conversations are full of 

310
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:19,214
falsehoods and lies.
People are nice to people that dislike 

311
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,950
there are being fake because we try to 
be friendly.

312
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,800
Yeah,
I mean it's.

313
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,340
Is it morally wrong to live your life in
that way?

314
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,173
Yes.
Yeah,

315
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,010
it is.
It is.

316
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,873
I mean,
you can't avoid the necessary conflict 

317
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,424
of negotiation towards peace if you 
avoided all that it means is that it 

318
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:45,014
accrues and multiplies.
So the oldest one of the oldest stories 

319
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:48,980
we have,
the oldest stories,

320
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,350
we have point to that as part of the 
prime moral doctrine.

321
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,663
You know,
it's,

322
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,650
it's,
it's a form of impulsivity.

323
00:17:55,651 --> 00:17:56,484
You know,
if you only do what you want in the 

324
00:17:57,421 --> 00:18:02,250
moment impulsively that there be 
consequences of that into the future,

325
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:04,080
which is why you shouldn't act 
impulsively,

326
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,830
impulsively.
Avoiding conflict is exactly the same.

327
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,390
And people,
same problem.

328
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:10,620
People know this.
You know if,

329
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,420
if someone's casually rude to you in,
in a bus driver for example,

330
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,070
and you'll,
you,

331
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,103
there's always the possibility that 
you'll stew for hours over what you 

332
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:22,854
should have said.
It's like when someone transgressed 

333
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,113
against you,
let's say you have to say what you have 

334
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:31,200
to say.

335
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,033
You don't have to say it as if you're 
the totally correct authoritarians 

336
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,780
tyrant.
You can say it in the spirit of,

337
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,680
of inquiry or inquiry,
you know,

338
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:41,514
because there's always the possibility 
that you're wrong and you want to 

339
00:18:43,771 --> 00:18:44,604
listen.
This is also why you want to listen to 

340
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:47,270
your partner,
your,

341
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,540
your,
your spouse.

342
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,900
Even if what they're saying to you is 
you find very annoying.

343
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,770
It's always possible that they're right 
and you should listen because if they're

344
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:56,604
right,
then they can stop you from heading for 

345
00:18:57,961 --> 00:18:59,010
trouble.
In the future.

346
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,120
I want to go backwards.
I want to talk about rule number seven.

347
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,270
Yeah.
Pursue.

348
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,920
What is meaningful,
not was this expedient.

349
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,633
You write in the book,
there is no faith and no courage and no 

350
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:18,240
sacrifice and doing what is expedient.
What do you say to those of you?

351
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,074
Where's that?
Don't pursue their dreams are locked 

352
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,283
into their cadets because they are too 
afraid to take risks and pursue 

353
00:19:26,551 --> 00:19:27,330
something meaningful.

354
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,070
Well,
the first thing I would say is,

355
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,293
well,
you shouldn't be afraid of taking risks 

356
00:19:31,441 --> 00:19:35,790
and pursuing something meaningful,
but you should be more afraid of staying

357
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,680
where you are.
If it's making you miserable,

358
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,823
it's like the first thing you want to do
is dispensed with the idea that you get 

359
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:42,504
to have any,
any permanent security outside of your 

360
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:48,840
ability to contend and adapt.
It's the same issue with children.

361
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,650
It's like you're paying a price by 
sitting there being miserable.

362
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,523
You might say,
well,

363
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,650
the devil I know is better than the one 
I don't.

364
00:19:55,651 --> 00:19:57,750
It's like,
don't be so sure of that.

365
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:01,920
The clock is ticking and if you're 
miserable in your job now and you change

366
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:02,754
nothing in five years,
you will be much more miserable and 

367
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:08,010
you'll be a lot older,
but this isn't the luxury to pursue what

368
00:20:08,011 --> 00:20:10,140
is meaningful.
Our viewers have with,

369
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,290
they have children,
they have payments in loans.

370
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,140
It's a luxury to pursue because we lack 
the resources.

371
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,010
Well,
I don't think.

372
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:17,844
I don't remember now.
I'm not talking about what makes you 

373
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:20,274
happy.
It's a luxury to pursue what makes you 

374
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:23,334
happy.
It's a moral obligation to pursue what 

375
00:20:25,561 --> 00:20:28,440
you find meaningful and that doesn't 
mean it's easy.

376
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,190
It might require sacrifice.
If you need to change your job to,

377
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:36,180
let's say you have a family and and and 
children and a mortgage,

378
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:37,014
you have responsibilities.
You've already picked up those 

379
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:40,374
responsibilities.
You don't just get to walk away Scott 

380
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:43,141
free say,
well,

381
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,610
I don't like my job.
I quit.

382
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,833
That's no strategy.
But what you might have to do is you 

383
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:48,251
think,
well,

384
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:51,760
this job is killing my soul or right,
so what do I have to do about that?

385
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,953
Well,
I have to look for another job while no 

386
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:55,570
one wants to hire me.
It's like,

387
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:58,720
okay,
maybe you need to educate yourself more.

388
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,060
Maybe you need to update your 
curriculum,

389
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:01,923
veto your resume.
Maybe you need to overcome your fear of 

390
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:05,404
being interviewed.
Maybe you need to sharpen your social 

391
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:08,944
skills like you.
You have to think about these things 

392
00:21:10,661 --> 00:21:12,730
strategically.
If you're going to switch careers,

393
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:16,660
you have to do it like an intelligent,
responsible person that might take you a

394
00:21:16,661 --> 00:21:17,990
couple of years of,
of,

395
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,093
of effort to do properly.
When you say pursue something 

396
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:22,750
meaningful,
is it important to have a vocation?

397
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,160
I think it's more important to to have 
a,

398
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,700
an ethos and ethic,
so I have a program,

399
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,860
for example,
called the future authoring program,

400
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:33,723
which isn't writing program that enables
people to develop a vision for their 

401
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:41,020
life and then to develop a strategy and 
so it's based on the idea.

402
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,063
Imagine that and it's an extension of 
the ideas in the book or at least 

403
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,390
something along the same lines.

404
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,120
The first thing that you want to do is 
figure out.

405
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,420
Imagine you were taking care of yourself
like you were someone you cared for,

406
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,040
which is rule number two,
by the way.

407
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:57,070
Essentially then you should figure out,
well,

408
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,350
if you could have what you needed and 
wanted,

409
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,440
what would it be?
What sort of friends would you have?

410
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,750
What would your family relationships 
look like?

411
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,760
How would you conduct yourself with your
children?

412
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,960
How would you educate yourself?
You need to think through how it is that

413
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:11,794
your life could be properly arranged if 
you had that ability and then you can 

414
00:22:16,691 --> 00:22:20,110
name it that,
and the funny thing is is that if you do

415
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,800
pause it,
a goal of that sort and work towards it,

416
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,113
you will move towards it.
The goal will change because you'll 

417
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:29,230
learn things along the way,
but I mean I've.

418
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,123
I've dealt with hundreds of people in my
clinical and consulting practice and we 

419
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:34,930
set a goal.

420
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:35,763
We develop a vision and work towards it 
and it things inevitably get better for 

421
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:43,090
people.
So it's not a luxury.

422
00:22:43,091 --> 00:22:44,170
It's,
it's difficult.

423
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,750
It's a moral responsibility and it isn't
happiness.

424
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:47,471
It's,
it's not.

425
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:48,304
The pursuit isn't for happiness.
It's a moral responsibility to push you 

426
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,320
what is meaningful.
Absolutely.

427
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,460
I would like to end the interview with,
uh,

428
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:58,510
with site and criticism from your front.
Oh,

429
00:22:58,511 --> 00:22:59,900
yes.
I'm Bernard shift.

430
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,940
Yes.
Your friends many years.

431
00:23:01,941 --> 00:23:03,700
Some former colleagues at the University
of Toronto.

432
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,713
Yes.
He wrote an article about you in the 

433
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,020
Toronto Star recently.
Yes.

434
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,943
Uh,
it was quite hard criticism on what do 

435
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,840
you have been doing in the last few 
years and he wrote,

436
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,733
Jonathan is fighting to maintain the 
status quo to keep cares bay or so he 

437
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:20,080
believes he is not a free speech 
warrior.

438
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,260
He is a social author,
warriors are,

439
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:24,094
you were social author warrior.
I think that people can decide that for 

440
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:27,934
themselves.

441
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,480
I mean,
one of the things that Bernie criticized

442
00:23:31,481 --> 00:23:34,540
was my lecturing style at the 
university.

443
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,943
Now all those lectures are online.
All the essentially like a 

444
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:41,344
representative sample of my lectures 
from the last 30 years are online and I 

445
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:48,560
hundreds of hours.
It's not a few fragments and hundreds of

446
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:49,394
thousands of people have watched them.
And the criticisms that Bernie leveled 

447
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:56,000
at me have not been leveled at me by the
watchers.

448
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:59,840
And so people can go watch the lectures 
and make up their own mind about that,

449
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,290
but he also crashed into her motives.
He,

450
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:03,124
uh,
he wants to know what your endgame is 

451
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:04,761
all about.
I mean,

452
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:05,594
what is your primary motive?
My primary motive as a clinical 

453
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:09,614
psychologist and educator is to help 
individuals live more meaningful and 

454
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:17,150
productive lives in harmony with their 
families and their community.

455
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,320
That's my motive.
And the evidence for that I think is.

456
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,330
Well,
if people go online,

457
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,223
first of all,
he could watch the lectures and decide 

458
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:26,900
for yourself,
but you can also go,

459
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,153
there's a suspect,
probably maybe 250,000 people have 

460
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,750
commented on the lectures and their 
effects on them.

461
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:40,070
And so that's what people say.
I'm watching the lectures.

462
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,380
I'm trying to develop a vision for my 
life.

463
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,680
I'm trying to become more responsible 
and it's really helping.

464
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,920
And that's.
And that's what I hear all the time when

465
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:51,620
I do these public lectures like which,
which aren't political,

466
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,380
but when we gain success,
really raised the bar,

467
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,260
we set our ambitions higher.
I mean,

468
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:58,820
what is your end game?
What do you want?

469
00:24:58,821 --> 00:25:00,410
That's all.
That's what I want.

470
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:01,244
I want.
I want to help as many individuals as 

471
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:08,720
possible become more courageous,
more truthful,

472
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,220
and more engaged in the pursuit of 
individual,

473
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,520
familial and social harmony.
That's what I want.

474
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:21,080
You're pursuing what is meaningful?
I'm pursuing.

475
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,230
I believe that to be the case.
It's certainly meaningful to me.

476
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:27,200
I mean,
there isn't everywhere I go now,

477
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,880
it doesn't matter where I land in the 
airport or if I walked down the street,

478
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,823
three or four people will come up to me 
and they'll tell me I was in a dark 

479
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:38,750
place.
I was anxious,

480
00:25:38,751 --> 00:25:39,950
depressed,
nihilistic,

481
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:40,641
drug,
addicted,

482
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:42,560
alcoholic,
homeless in jail.

483
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:46,100
You name it.
Bad relationship with my girlfriend,

484
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,203
bad relationship with my parents.
I've been watching your lectures or 

485
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:50,654
reading your book.
I've been trying to tell the truth and 

486
00:25:52,371 --> 00:25:56,510
get my life together and everything is 
way better and so then you think,

487
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:57,344
well,
if you could have what you wanted and 

488
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:01,700
what would be meaningful,
you imagine you could go anywhere in the

489
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:02,534
world and people would come up to you 
that we're strangers and tell you that 

490
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,000
that's as good as it gets.
What about politics?

491
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,740
Do you have political ambitions?
No.

492
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,790
No political ambitions?
No.

493
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,653
I.
I have ambitions to speak with people 

494
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:17,150
who are politically motivated if they 
want to speak with me,

495
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:22,430
but personally I've already decided that
what I'm doing at the moment is more,

496
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:23,923
and I thought this my.
I've made this choice multiple times in 

497
00:26:25,701 --> 00:26:28,460
my life that this approach is more 
suitable for me.

498
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,080
Okay.
Ms Dot Peterson.

499
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:32,630
Thank you for your time.
Thank you very much for the interview.
