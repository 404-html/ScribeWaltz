1
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,260
Last time we spoke,
it was not so long ago,

2
00:00:17,261 --> 00:00:18,094
but
you've been in the headlights even more 

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,400
since the,
since the release of the book and uh,

4
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:27,413
and also the,
a beautiful interview with Katherine 

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,340
Newman.

6
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,173
Yeah.
Well that seemed to start a whole new 

7
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,800
plateau,
let's say,

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,930
of interest.
Yeah.

9
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:40,764
And I thought that yes,
I've been in the headlines a lot and 

10
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,330
rather an settling amount I would say.

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,473
Yeah.
And I don't want to dwell on the cat 

12
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,620
thing,
human interview too much because,

13
00:00:57,621 --> 00:00:58,141
uh,
you've,

14
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,500
uh,
you've been,

15
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:01,590
uh,
made to talk so much about it,

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,990
but I think you're probably tired about 
it,

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:09,020
but just one thing that I think you 
demonstrated very clearly,

18
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:14,000
uh,
about yourself and also about,

19
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,913
uh,
saying that patience is a virtue that 

20
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,340
you actually,
in the end you want out,

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,913
uh,
because you stayed calm and you 

22
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:25,344
explained what you actually meant.
And in the end she liked words and I 

23
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:35,700
think that actually was an inspiring 
example to a lot of people.

24
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,670
Yeah.
It seems to have been in,

25
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,200
although it isn't clear why was.
It isn't,

26
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:46,180
still isn't really clear to me why it 
became so incredibly widespread.

27
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,043
I mean,
I think the interview itself on Youtube 

28
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:52,810
as something approximating 8 million 
views,

29
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:53,644
but if you add the commentaries to that,
lots of people have cut it up and 

30
00:01:57,941 --> 00:01:59,440
commented on it.
I think it's,

31
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:00,963
I suspect it exceeds 20 million and 
there was something about the interview 

32
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:07,180
that really attracted a tremendous 
amount of attention.

33
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,613
So it's very interesting.
It's obviously part and parcel of the 

34
00:02:11,861 --> 00:02:12,694
political tension that's,
that's odd that it seems to underlie 

35
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:17,080
virtually everything right now.

36
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,700
I think it's
from the platonic ideal states,

37
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,663
like this is the interview that 
illustrates the cultural world where 

38
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:36,710
everything that's wrong about not taking
your opponents seriously,

39
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,350
uh,
then you can always show that interview.

40
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,313
So it's a great,
a great way to just introduce people to 

41
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:47,480
what's wrong with the political 
discourse.

42
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:48,010
I think

43
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,870
I have.
I have a hypothesis to run by you.

44
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,290
Well,
so imagine what's happening.

45
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,124
Is this the.
We're in the midst of a technological 

46
00:02:58,431 --> 00:02:59,264
transformation and the online video 
services are displacing network and 

47
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:06,064
cable television.
And the online print services are 

48
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:12,730
displacing the traditional print media,
so let's say that,

49
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,780
okay,
so there's increasing desperation on the

50
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,614
part of the traditional media and so 
then let's say that as a consequence of 

51
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:24,870
that,
that did that additional nervousness and

52
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,400
instability.
First of all,

53
00:03:26,401 --> 00:03:27,234
many people are leaving,
second budgets are being cut and third 

54
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,230
there's increasing desperation for to 
hold on to market share.

55
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,463
And as a consequence of that,
more and more articles are polarized 

56
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,683
because they attract more attention and 
that that's driving the political 

57
00:03:46,171 --> 00:03:49,500
polarization in part.
Does that seem reasonable to you?

58
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,570
Yes,
I do think that seems reasonable.

59
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,820
And I do think

60
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,233
you also have a greater need for the 
established media to debunk a sort of 

61
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:10,360
the,
the people who are popular on Youtube or

62
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,620
podcasts

63
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,450
free free from

64
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,990
the big thing.

65
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,870
Yeah.
Also some of the TV channels.

66
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,113
Yeah.
So you think it's also direct 

67
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:22,840
competition?
Yes,

68
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:25,360
but I'm not sure if it's

69
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,670
a sort of a conscious effort.
I think also it's incompetent

70
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,100
sometimes.
You never,

71
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:36,120
never underestimate everything together 
like a

72
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,620
life extremism,
populism,

73
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,610
and they have a very hard time 
discerning what sort of

74
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,830
the real Nazis from just people

75
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,860
having legitimate ideas and legitimate.
That's another issue,

76
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:58,624
right,
is that it's in the radical left 

77
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,720
interest to lump everyone who opposes 
their ideological attempts into a single

78
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,253
terrifying category because if,
if they had to contend with the fact 

79
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:16,474
that you can be reasonable centrist or 
even reasonable center leftist and 

80
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,660
dispute the validity of identity 
politics as a framework for conducting a

81
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:26,494
political discussion.
If you have to accept that reasonable 

82
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:29,764
people can do that,
then you have to accept that reasonable 

83
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:32,254
people can object to your ideology and 
that implies that your ideology isn't 

84
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:36,904
reasonable.
So there's every reason for people on 

85
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:45,181
the radical left to not only assume that
their opponents are reprehensible,

86
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:48,304
but to make the case that they're 
reprehensible without ever bothering to 

87
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,120
scratch below the surface.
So I think that's happening too.

88
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:55,954
And then of course,
I never wanted to let the university's 

89
00:05:58,161 --> 00:05:58,994
off the hook.
And I think the fact that the 

90
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:02,174
universities have allowed and encouraged
the growth of radical leftist ideology 

91
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:07,844
in the humanities and the social 
sciences is absolutely completely 

92
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:12,314
inexcusable.
So I might even prove fatal to the 

93
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:18,710
universities we'll see about that,
but it wouldn't surprise me.

94
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,470
Universities have been around a long 
time though.

95
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,653
Last we spoke,
I was doing a piece on how radical 

96
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,120
feminism had been mandatory for a course
at Lund University.

97
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:36,474
And we spoke about that.
The professor was a mandated to include 

98
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,313
you in this course and I continued
writing about the universities and it 

99
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:57,760
goes much deeper.
It goes even if you look at the grants,

100
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,620
if you look at,
we have 10,

101
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,750
10 billion kroners which are being 
distributed from the state and uh,

102
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,160
they,
they are the,

103
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,063
the gender mainstreaming that's taking 
place in the university universities 

104
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,070
when it comes to courses and uh,
the,

105
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,560
the reading lists and the professors.
It's also when it comes to the grants.

106
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:23,883
So you have to include a gender 
perspective or at least you have to 

107
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:30,340
specify why you don't have a gender 
perspective.

108
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,420
Right.
Which is probably fatal.

109
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,180
Yeah,
exactly.

110
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,073
So one of my,
a friend of mine that I got to know him 

111
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,573
via his dog because I have a dog and so 
our dogs became friends and then we 

112
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:47,851
became friends.
So he made his phd about trouts and wild

113
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,860
and wild trout.
And uh,

114
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,250
and um,
how do you say

115
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,930
a domestic trunks?
No.

116
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

117
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,060
So the difference in behavior sounds 
very boring,

118
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:05,370
but it's actually kind of interesting 
when

119
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:07,823
he was about to not get,
not get a grant because he didn't think 

120
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,600
religion perspective.

121
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,790
Yep.
And so,

122
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,970
well,
I know now

123
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,630
10 years ago and now it's spreading.
And so I'm,

124
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,850
I'm getting a lot of stories about that.
So it's crazy.

125
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,713
The universities or really it's shifted 
into second gear here in Sweden with 

126
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:28,350
this.

127
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,520
Yeah,
it's the same.

128
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,010
It's happening everywhere in the west,
I would say.

129
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,050
Um,
our,

130
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,140
our government just handed down a budget
and every,

131
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,213
as far as I can tell from the initial 
response and every government program 

132
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:47,280
has to include a gender perspective now 
in the same manner.

133
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,450
And so our government is deciding to 
solve a problem that doesn't exist.

134
00:08:51,451 --> 00:08:52,284
Well,
what's happened is that we've accepted 

135
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:54,234
equity,
we've accepted equality outcome as the 

136
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,100
measure by which we're going to judge 
the fairness of,

137
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:00,490
uh,
organizations,

138
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,483
um,
operations at the same time when the 

139
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:09,300
social science research is stacking up 
on the other side of the distribution to

140
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:14,301
state ever more clearly and with ever 
more with ever less doubt that as you,

141
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,153
um,
as you flatten out the sociological 

142
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:23,210
landscape so that men and women are 
treated more equally,

143
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,130
that the difference in their 
occupational choices widens,

144
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,660
become crystal clear.

145
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,733
And the,
the response to that from the radicals 

146
00:09:33,231 --> 00:09:34,064
is that pseudo science,
even though the people who are doing 

147
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:42,851
these studies aren't conservative,
there aren't conservatives in the social

148
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:43,824
sciences.
And so people do these studies and 

149
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:46,254
they're shocked by the results they 
publish them because they're good 

150
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:48,834
scientists.
Not because these findings buttress 

151
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,674
their ideological position and plus 
who's ideological position wasn't to 

152
00:09:56,851 --> 00:10:01,851
wish that as you flatten out the 
sociological and political landscape,

153
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,100
you make men and women more different.
Who is hoping for that?

154
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,530
No one was hoping for that.
So as,

155
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,560
as the science stacks up the legislative
and political attempts to silence it and

156
00:10:15,471 --> 00:10:19,250
to mount an ideological counterattack,
multiply

157
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,093
what do we need more,
more general science because the 

158
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:29,230
differences are accelerating.
So now we need even more,

159
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:35,170
more of the same.
But I would like to jump into the,

160
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:39,540
um,
uh,

161
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,553
to the book and see what I'm.
Because I read your book or I didn't 

162
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:47,030
really read it,
I actually listened to it,

163
00:10:47,031 --> 00:10:50,040
which was I can really recommend to 
people because you,

164
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:54,830
you did a fantastic job of reading the 
book by yourself.

165
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:55,664
And so

166
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,293
I was looking at the reviews on audible 
and there's a performance review and a 

167
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:02,724
content review.
Performance Review is higher than the 

168
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,850
content review and I don't know what to 
think about that.

169
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:10,770
I don't know whether I should be happy 
about that.

170
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,170
Are Not happy about that.
It's not much difference,

171
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:14,400
but I thought it was comical.

172
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,550
I think you should stop writing and you 
should just be a narrator of books.

173
00:11:19,551 --> 00:11:21,110
I think that's the takeaway.

174
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,710
Well,
I'm going to do an audio book version of

175
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:26,330
maps of meaning.
Yes.

176
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,800
That's great.
Yes,

177
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,620
that's coming that be like 25 hours long
or something like that.

178
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:34,360
Probably more so.

179
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,780
That's the first book I read,
uh,

180
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,200
as an,
as an audiobook was better angels of our

181
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:44,280
nature by Steven Pinker,
like 50 hours or something.

182
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,270
So it was a 25 hours.
It's not so bad.

183
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,320
Abi Bout too because it's a long book.
I'm probably,

184
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:55,260
I'm probably the amount of time we'll 
see

185
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,210
in your book.
I think the first room stand up straight

186
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:04,400
with your shoulders back.
I think that's a really.

187
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:07,250
When you read the chapter,
it's a really good chapter.

188
00:12:07,251 --> 00:12:09,370
But I,
uh,

189
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,830
as last time when I spoke to speak to 
you,

190
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:16,831
I went into the Jordan Peterson found 
groups in Sweden and uh,

191
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,920
I've,
I asked them what,

192
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,530
what do you think I should ask you?
And then they,

193
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,270
one of the guys was,
he said,

194
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,193
I really liked the book,
but when it says stand up straight with 

195
00:12:30,421 --> 00:12:31,254
your children's back,
I think you should explain more how to 

196
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:38,270
do it.
And then a lot of the helpful other guys

197
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,810
in the threads started giving him 
physical exercises,

198
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,900
how to strengthen the muscles between 
the shoulders,

199
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,130
how your shoulders back.
It was like a long thread on how to,

200
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,990
how to build your chest up.
Like,

201
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,873
and then in the end,
like after 20 or 30 comments like 

202
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:59,030
somebody suggested that maybe,
maybe you didn't mean it.

203
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,210
Literally.
He also meant it figuratively.

204
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,730
So,
but it was no,

205
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:05,590
no,
no meanness or anything.

206
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:09,910
But then it wasn't that,
it wasn't a physical advice.

207
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:14,080
It was mostly sort of a psychological 
advice,

208
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,620
a good place where the metaphorical and 
the literal meet.

209
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,500
Actually the important part of that 
chapter,

210
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:26,420
I think a part is that I was really 
trying to make a case and this is a case

211
00:13:26,421 --> 00:13:30,260
that needs to be made over and over and 
over until people understand it.

212
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,383
Uh,
there's a book I would recommend that 

213
00:13:32,481 --> 00:13:34,550
was recently written called the great 
leveler,

214
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,540
like Walter Shy Dale.
And it's the study of inequality.

215
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,613
And it's a brutal book because one of 
the things she does is he calculates 

216
00:13:43,341 --> 00:13:45,890
inequality coefficients,
like the Gini Coefficient,

217
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,890
which is a measure of inequality,
economic inequality,

218
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,083
and he looks over the empirical data to 
see if there's any relationship between 

219
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,583
the the left or the right wing nature of
a government and the inequality in the 

220
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:01,244
society.
And so what you'd hope because 

221
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:05,180
inequality is actually a genuine 
problem.

222
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,403
You'd hope that left wing governments 
were better at regulating inequality 

223
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:13,520
than right wing governments.

224
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,460
You'd hope that there's no evidence for 
that whatsoever.

225
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:17,683
So I'm making a case in chapter one that
hierarchies exist and because 

226
00:14:22,941 --> 00:14:25,130
hierarchies exist,
inequality exists,

227
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:28,910
or at least the two things are are 
indistinguishable at many levels,

228
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,493
but that you can't blame the existence 
of hierarchy or inequality on something 

229
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:38,780
proximal like capitalism or Western 
society.

230
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,800
Inequality is the rule all the way back 
down to crustaceans.

231
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,203
And so when the Marxists complained 
about inequality and how intractable it 

232
00:14:47,331 --> 00:14:49,070
is,
while they have a point,

233
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,173
but when they blame it on capitalism,
they're not taking the problem 

234
00:14:52,941 --> 00:14:56,990
seriously.
It's way worse than the Marxist.

235
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:01,670
Think
inequality is genuinely a problem.

236
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,580
Now,
but it's a problem in,

237
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,490
in a bunch of ways.
The first is,

238
00:15:06,491 --> 00:15:07,324
is that
those at the top tend to get more and 

239
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:15,230
those at the bottom tend to end up with 
zero and zero's really not good.

240
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,420
Now you might say,
well,

241
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:21,230
in the capitalist society,
in modern industrial capitalist society,

242
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,950
people tend not to end up at zero so 
much and that seems to be true.

243
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,830
It is definitely the case.
And,

244
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,750
and I think pinker has done a good job 
of outlining this,

245
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:30,843
uh,
that people that human progress.org are 

246
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:36,170
doing a good job of the two.
It's definitely the case that our modern

247
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:41,060
societies are making the poor,
much less absolutely poor.

248
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,703
So we've,
we've decreased poverty worldwide 

249
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:49,070
between 2000 and 2012 by 50 percent a 
massive accomplishment.

250
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:50,870
We should be partying in the streets 
about it.

251
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,340
It's an amazing accomplishment,
but inequality is still a problem.

252
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,653
So,
so that chapter's about how deep the 

253
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:00,860
problem is.
Now,

254
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:06,150
the suggestion is is that to compete in 
a world where there's unequal outcome,

255
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:10,820
your best bet is to take the full 
tragedy of being full frontal,

256
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:11,870
essentially,
right?

257
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:12,883
To open yourself up to the catastrophe 
of existence and to move forward with 

258
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:22,151
courage and and and with nobility and 
with with truth on your tongue.

259
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,010
That's your best bet and I do believe 
that.

260
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:25,844
Now I can give you an example of that.
We did research on a program called the 

261
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:32,084
future authoring program,
and it's a part of the suite that's 

262
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:38,840
offered at self authoring dog come and 
we did the research.

263
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:39,674
The idea was to produce psychological 
interventions that were very cost 

264
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:46,280
effective that could be distributed to 
many people,

265
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,220
but we wanted to test them because you 
never know if you're an idiot.

266
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,890
Intervention is going to do something 
good or something bad.

267
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,040
That's like rule number one for a 
serious social scientists.

268
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,203
Assume your idiot intervention will 
either be useless or harmful because 

269
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:02,450
those are the most likely outcomes.
Right?

270
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:03,763
And any social scientist who's truly 
credible understands that those who 

271
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:09,950
don't are not educated properly.

272
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:11,683
So anyways,
we tested the future authoring program 

273
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:18,251
and we mostly tested it in Holland and 
we did some stratification by group,

274
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,860
so in Holland,
this was at the Rotterdam School of,

275
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:25,550
at at the Rotterdam School of management
at Erasmus University.

276
00:17:25,551 --> 00:17:26,384
We had thousands of university students 
do the future authoring program where 

277
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:30,074
they laid out a plan for their life and 
they tried to optimize their lives 

278
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,610
along.
They want to consider their friendships,

279
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,680
intimate relationships,
career choices,

280
00:17:39,681 --> 00:17:42,140
educational choices,
mental and physical health,

281
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:46,850
use of drugs and alcohol and use of time
productively outside of work to optimize

282
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:50,780
across all those levels and then to 
avoid catastrophic pitfalls.

283
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:51,614
So you write about what your life could 
be like if you could have what you 

284
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:57,160
needed in three to five years and then 
what,

285
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,103
right about what your life could be like
if everything fell apart on you and and 

286
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,490
things went bad.
All right,

287
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,930
so they all did this exercise.

288
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,480
Now,
before the exercise,

289
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,930
the Dutch women were outperforming the 
Dutchman,

290
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,240
let's say the Caucasians and the Non 
Western ethnic minority women were doing

291
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:17,154
worse than the Dutchman and the non 
western ethic minority men were doing 

292
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:21,480
worse,
the worst of all,

293
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:22,314
four groups,
about an 85 percent performance 

294
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:28,890
detriment compared to the Dutch women 
two years after the intervention.

295
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,290
They were doing better than the Dutch 
women,

296
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,410
right?
Man,

297
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,210
it blew us away.
We couldn't believe.

298
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,390
And that's research published with 
mckayla shipper and and,

299
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,263
and,
and some other colleagues that from 

300
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:43,494
Holland.
And what was so interesting about that 

301
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:46,854
was that a psychological intervention 
seemed to remove the barriers that were 

302
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:54,240
produced by what was hypothetically 
associate logical barrier.

303
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:55,963
It might be that if you're an immigrant 
to a country that you don't have your 

304
00:18:58,831 --> 00:19:00,780
story straight because it's so 
complicated.

305
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,310
Yeah.
So you need a better plan.

306
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,350
So.
And that's part of standing up.

307
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:07,280
It's like,
okay man,

308
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:08,114
make a plan for the future,
plan a good future and move forward 

309
00:19:11,811 --> 00:19:12,644
towards it.

310
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,730
And also one thing that I took away 
from,

311
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,960
from the chapters and take yourself 
seriously.

312
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:27,130
Otherwise no one else will.
If you don't stand up for yourself,

313
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,990
you will get pushed down and pushed over
and not be taking notice.

314
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:34,690
Yeah,
well,

315
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:35,523
I think the way you take yourself 
seriously as you start to constrain 

316
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,020
yourself as a player in the catastrophe 
of the world.

317
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,320
Now the world,
and this is a motif route.

318
00:19:44,321 --> 00:19:46,900
12 rules for life in many ways is a very
dark book.

319
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:50,740
Although it has a very optimistic 
central message.

320
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,300
The darkness is life is tragic and 
tainted by malevolence,

321
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,703
but the optimism is there's a hell of a 
lot more to you than you think and I 

322
00:20:00,621 --> 00:20:01,454
think that's a message that's really 
good for people because everyone knows 

323
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:06,620
that life is a catastrophe that's 
tainted by malevolence.

324
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,633
Everyone knows that even if people don't
want to admit it at the bottom of their 

325
00:20:09,861 --> 00:20:10,694
heart,
they know it and I think they also 

326
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,560
suspect that there's more to them than 
meets the eye.

327
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,630
So and so.
So the,

328
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:20,703
the,
the trick to taking yourself seriously 

329
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:27,101
is to understand that your errors count.
They make things worse.

330
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,073
Like it really is the case that it 
matters whether you get your act 

331
00:20:30,691 --> 00:20:31,524
together at least because if you're 
fragmented and disillusioned and 

332
00:20:36,031 --> 00:20:40,230
resentful and angry and working to make 
things worse,

333
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,153
you really can make them worse.
The school shooters are a good example 

334
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:45,544
of that.
People who become so nihilistic and 

335
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,130
desperate and then angry that no,
they,

336
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,630
they,
they slaughter the innocent in,

337
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,710
in a,
in a fit events fullness.

338
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,960
Like that's sort of the bottom end of,
of the descent for human beings.

339
00:20:58,961 --> 00:20:59,950
It's really terrible

340
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,230
because you,
you,

341
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,180
you,
um,

342
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,960
you deal a lot with Christianity and 
Christian thought with both,

343
00:21:14,961 --> 00:21:19,961
with mostly with the old testament but 
also with new testament in the Christian

344
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,960
motifs.
But you get the sense from your book,

345
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,040
from your,
your teaching when you talk about this,

346
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:32,973
that
we can really create for ourselves in 

347
00:21:38,851 --> 00:21:39,684
this world when we have no problem with 
creating a variety of health for 

348
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:48,330
ourselves and for others.
So that's within our,

349
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,350
our,

350
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,070
in our grasp.
That's exactly right.

351
00:21:52,071 --> 00:21:54,620
Is that hell is definitely within our 
grasp.

352
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,503
And uh,
and I think with our engineering we can 

353
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,400
invent many kinds of health.
But I would also,

354
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,913
do you think there's a,
do we have the capacity to create 

355
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:14,470
paradise on earth?
You think that within our grasp,

356
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,940
I think that that's what we struggle 
upwards toward.

357
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,440
You know,
I was thinking recently about this image

358
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,920
came to mind of St Joseph's oratorial in
Montreal,

359
00:22:25,921 --> 00:22:29,020
which is a huge religious building.
Um,

360
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:33,030
it's one of the biggest cathedral.
I don't think it's a cathedral because I

361
00:22:33,031 --> 00:22:33,864
think it's an oratorial,
although I don't know technically the 

362
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:37,010
difference.
Um,

363
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,130
but it's one of the biggest religious 
edifice is in the world and it was built

364
00:22:41,131 --> 00:22:41,964
in the latter half of the 20th century,
which is quite interesting because most 

365
00:22:45,151 --> 00:22:48,360
buildings have religious significance 
work built that late.

366
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,310
But anyways,
it's up on Mount Royal,

367
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:53,760
so it's up on the hill.
And so it's the city on the hill,

368
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:55,620
right?
It's the universal city on the hill.

369
00:22:55,621 --> 00:22:58,220
It's an image of perfection.
It's a lot.

370
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,073
It's like stonework lit,
like the interior of a forest devoted 

371
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:05,250
towards the glory of being in God.

372
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,450
So it's an image of,
of,

373
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,850
of,
of paradise we could say.

374
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,100
And then it's at the top of the hill and
you climb up to it as a consequence of a

375
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:14,934
very large staircase set into the hill 
and pilgrims went there quite regularly 

376
00:23:19,321 --> 00:23:20,154
in the 20th century who were often 
physically disabled and so they would 

377
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,950
struggle up the hill on their crutches 
or or or,

378
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,570
or with their,
with their,

379
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,180
with their damaged limbs and with their 
illnesses.

380
00:23:30,181 --> 00:23:34,980
And so they would struggle up the hill 
towards the heavenly city essentially.

381
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:37,500
And that's what we're to do.
That's correct.

382
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,960
That it's a drama that people were 
acting out.

383
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:40,794
Now,
St Joseph's also happens to be full of 

384
00:23:42,871 --> 00:23:47,871
crutches that people left there for.
Which is quite interesting to see.

385
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,130
But,
but that doesn't,

386
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,143
that doesn't matter in some sense.
So much as the symbolic meaning is all 

387
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,030
these damaged people who were carrying a
terrible load,

388
00:23:56,031 --> 00:23:59,810
like they weren't just subject to the 
normative tragedy of being.

389
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,643
They were also physically disabled would
go there and struggle up these hundreds 

390
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:07,550
of stairs as they were trying to send 
instead of descending.

391
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:08,893
And it's like,
well,

392
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,960
we can certainly believe in hell if we 
have any sense.

393
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,290
If you don't believe that human beings 
can create hell,

394
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,690
then you're a child,
you're a naive child,

395
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:18,524
you know nothing,
you know nothing about history or 

396
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:22,400
yourself and you say,
well,

397
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:24,770
can we,
can we bring paradise into being?

398
00:24:24,771 --> 00:24:25,341
Well,
no,

399
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:26,174
but maybe we can at least walk up the 
hill away from hell and who knows what 

400
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:33,050
we could do if we took it seriously,
if we took our,

401
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,460
the idea that we needed to shoulder our 
burden and with truth,

402
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:38,294
if we took that seriously,
as serious as the hell should make you 

403
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,670
take it.
Who knows what we could accomplish?

404
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,930
You know,
as I said,

405
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:45,764
we've lifted,
you've reduced the poverty rate in the 

406
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:51,890
world by 50 percent from the year 2000 
to the year,

407
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:56,891
2012 and something like 300,000 people 
are being attached to the power grid.

408
00:24:57,141 --> 00:24:57,974
Now worldwide.
I don't remember if it's a week or a 

409
00:24:59,991 --> 00:25:00,824
day,
but it's either of those metrics is 

410
00:25:02,241 --> 00:25:06,350
still pretty good.
Fastest growing economies are in Africa.

411
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,760
Like,
you know,

412
00:25:07,761 --> 00:25:08,594
we,
we've made amazing strides in the last 

413
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,473
50 years and they seem to be 
accelerating and so I don't know what 

414
00:25:14,421 --> 00:25:15,254
the upper limit for us is if we don't 
dissolve ourselves into idiot identity 

415
00:25:18,891 --> 00:25:20,070
politics and,
and,

416
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,970
and start a civil war.
No.

417
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:24,843
So

418
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:30,010
I think one of the reasons why very,
I certainly do.

419
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:37,060
I think people in general do as well.
I'm a very easy time imagining horrible,

420
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:41,530
horrible things and daydreaming about 
horrible things,

421
00:25:41,531 --> 00:25:46,040
horrible things that could happen to you
or things that you could do and uh,

422
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:50,230
and,
but it's very hard to imagine a heaven.

423
00:25:50,231 --> 00:25:53,800
For example,
look at Dante.

424
00:25:53,801 --> 00:25:55,550
Oh,
inferno.

425
00:25:55,551 --> 00:25:59,120
It's a,
I think he wrote about heaven as well.

426
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:04,121
I'm not
a really boring book.

427
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,833
Angels,
angels in white singing and stuff like 

428
00:26:09,951 --> 00:26:10,784
that.
Then it's,

429
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:14,660
it doesn't sound like heaven to me.
It's a but hell sounds like hell

430
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,320
right.
Interesting.

431
00:26:18,321 --> 00:26:19,154
Because,
you know,

432
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:23,690
um,
I would say mainstream Christians,

433
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:24,524
especially on the Protestant and have 
tried to force hell out of the human 

434
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:28,124
imagination over the last hundred years,
maybe as a way of making Christianity 

435
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:33,590
more marketable.
Although I don't think it's worked,

436
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:39,010
but I do think that belief in hell,
metaphorically,

437
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,953
let's say,
although I tell you if you're in one of 

438
00:26:42,071 --> 00:26:44,010
those situations,
it feels eternal,

439
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,263
so that's something to keep in mind too,
but I think it's unbelievably salutary 

440
00:26:49,261 --> 00:26:52,830
because even though we can't imagine 
heaven so clearly,

441
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,300
we can certainly say,
well,

442
00:26:54,301 --> 00:26:57,560
at least it's not Auschwitz.
Right.

443
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,520
Totally agree on that.
Whatever it is,

444
00:26:59,521 --> 00:27:02,250
it's as far away from Auschwitz as you 
can get

445
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,770
and that's.
That's a direction you know,

446
00:27:05,771 --> 00:27:06,520
it's,
it's,

447
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,010
it's not as specific as you might like 
it to be,

448
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:09,844
but that's also why I've been suggesting
to people that they think about this 

449
00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:12,850
locally.

450
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:13,683
It's like,
okay,

451
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:18,760
we're not so sure what the utopia might 
be and we know that collectively,

452
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,240
presuming a utopia also seems to be a 
dangerous thing,

453
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:23,523
but there are stupid things that you're 
doing to make your life and the life of 

454
00:27:26,531 --> 00:27:29,590
people around you more wretched and 
miserable than necessary,

455
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:33,240
and it's hypothetically the case that 
you could stop doing some of them,

456
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:37,590
so there is a good place to start.
It's nice and humble.

457
00:27:37,591 --> 00:27:40,530
It's like you're less than you could be 
and you know it,

458
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,470
and there's things you could do about 
that and you know it.

459
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,903
So,
so maybe maybe it would be okay to take 

460
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:48,930
a step in the right direction,

461
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:54,720
think you say in the book,
and you open the return to the,

462
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,650
uh,
the,

463
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,730
the basic truth,
and you say that you arrive at this when

464
00:28:01,731 --> 00:28:02,564
you contemplate the horribleness of the 
20th century with Auschwitz and the 

465
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:14,321
Gulag and the life there is,
life is suffering and you can't,

466
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,050
you can produce the way the pain of 
existence.

467
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:21,840
And uh,
there is no totalitarian that can reduce

468
00:28:21,841 --> 00:28:22,674
the way that

469
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,753
you can just forbid it in Venezuela.
Now it's illegal to last list the cause 

470
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:32,410
of the death of a child as starvation in
the hospitals.

471
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,700
That's convenient.
Oh yes.

472
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,690
Isn't that something?
Isn't that something?

473
00:28:36,691 --> 00:28:38,730
So there we go.
Now we've got the utopia.

474
00:28:38,731 --> 00:28:42,450
It's now illegal to die of starvation in
the hospital in Venezuela,

475
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,480
or at least to have it listed.
And that's exactly it,

476
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,850
man.
There is a little slice of hell for you.

477
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:56,230
One of the.
It's easier to move away from,

478
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,990
it's not easy,
but it's,

479
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,050
it's easier to stop doing,
causing harm and causing suffering.

480
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,830
Then too,
uh,

481
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:09,850
Ryan at bliss,
that's sort of a basic way.

482
00:29:10,781 --> 00:29:15,760
We are very bad at a pretty bad,
uh,

483
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,620
having eternal bliss in this life.

484
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,011
Well,
yeah,

485
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:22,930
it's not easy to conceptualize what it 
would be.

486
00:29:22,931 --> 00:29:23,890
I mean,
you do,

487
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,170
you do taste it at times,
you know,

488
00:29:26,171 --> 00:29:29,110
you tasted with music.
And of course that's why there's imagery

489
00:29:29,111 --> 00:29:32,470
of angels and,
and the heavenly hosts singing,

490
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,713
you know,
because people do get a taste of what 

491
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,140
paradise might be like when they 
listened to music,

492
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,003
which is why music is so powerful for 
people because it speaks of a kind of 

493
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:45,790
transcendent harmony of the,
of the layers of being.

494
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:46,624
And it engages a person in that.
And you get that as well when you're 

495
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:50,164
engaged in what you're doing,
deeply engaged in what you're doing and 

496
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:53,224
finding meaningful but mean stepping 
rapidly away from hell might be a form 

497
00:29:57,641 --> 00:29:58,870
of bliss.
You know,

498
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,913
to know that a minimum,
you're not contributing to the terrible 

499
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:06,600
suffering of the world and maybe you're 
doing something to to lift the,

500
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,800
to lift the burden in a positive way.

501
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,043
I mean,
it's really complicated because you 

502
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:16,300
don't want everything to be easy.
That's not a good idea for utopia.

503
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,190
Everything's blissful,
uneasy,

504
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,890
and all you're doing is laying back and 
eating peeled grapes.

505
00:30:20,891 --> 00:30:21,724
You know it's.
There's nothing to that that would last 

506
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:24,304
more than a week.
You need and need an adventure and you 

507
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:27,424
need a struggle,
but perhaps we could have the adventure 

508
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:33,920
and the struggle without the pointless 
suffering and malevolence.

509
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:34,783
We could at least aim at that and then 
who knows what we might transmute that 

510
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:38,384
into at least we might be able to 
transmute it into lives that are 

511
00:30:41,661 --> 00:30:42,494
meaningful despite their suffering.
That would be a good start and I do 

512
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:46,874
believe that that's a.
I believe that that's an attainable 

513
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:53,270
reality.
I believe that that we are strong enough

514
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:54,463
as in our essence to rise above the 
tragedy of existence and to live 

515
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:02,630
normally and with purpose and honorably.
I believe we can do that,

516
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:03,703
and so that's why I think 12 rules for 
life is a fundamentally optimistic book 

517
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,260
because I also think that that's a 
believable message.

518
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,940
No one's going to say,
well,

519
00:31:11,941 --> 00:31:13,130
we believe that.
Well,

520
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:17,050
we're going to eradicate suffering and 
malevolence.

521
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,410
It's like,
no,

522
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,563
I don't think so,
but we can constrain it within the 

523
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:25,440
confines of our own being.
And that's good enough.

524
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,550
That's a good start.

525
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,330
Rule number eight,
you say,

526
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,343
tell the truth.
You should tell the truth and you're 

527
00:31:40,121 --> 00:31:40,954
right,
that it is our responsibility is to see 

528
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:46,780
what it is before our eyes courageously 
and to learn from it,

529
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,390
even if it seems horrible,
even if the horror of seeing them,

530
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,840
which is our consciousness and half for 
instance.

531
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:54,723
Uh,
and then I just thought about that for 

532
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,660
awhile.
And,

533
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,870
uh,
during the,

534
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,900
when Isis invaded Iraq in 2007,
14,

535
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:10,410
I think it was 2015,
2014.

536
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,030
And,
uh,

537
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:18,031
I was one of the few who wrote about
following that right then because nobody

538
00:32:19,331 --> 00:32:22,090
thought it would take over such a large 
part of Iraq.

539
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:28,420
And then I was watching loads of videos 
of mass killings and the capitations and

540
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:31,090
murders,
and I was seeing,

541
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,353
I had contact with eyewitnesses via a 
journalists whose names Newark Newer 

542
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Keno,
and it was horrible,

543
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,990
really,
really horrible,

544
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,110
horrible,
the most horrible thing I've ever seen.

545
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,600
And because I had contact with neuro 
Akina,

546
00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:51,470
whose father had had family members down
there,

547
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:55,140
Assyrian Christians who are being 
murdered and driven from their homes.

548
00:32:55,610 --> 00:33:00,350
And this was even before the same jar 
where they took this sex slaves and they

549
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:04,390
murdered the whole people use the CDC 
app.

550
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,430
So it was really horrible.
And so for them,

551
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,680
I mean,
of course that's the big deal.

552
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,450
Uh,
but I,

553
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:17,070
I felt I had the responsibility to see 
this for myself,

554
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:21,030
get not just listening to journalists 
who hadn't seen it because I was writing

555
00:33:21,031 --> 00:33:21,864
about it a lot myself and I could feel 
it changing me because this is the 

556
00:33:27,811 --> 00:33:32,760
absolute as close to absolute darkness 
as I've ever come come.

557
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,230
Because it was,
it was,

558
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,810
it was not historical.
These for people,

559
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,150
uh,
some younger than me,

560
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:39,984
some older.
But it was happening as I was watching 

561
00:33:42,871 --> 00:33:44,230
it.
Uh,

562
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,510
and then I thought about the quote by 
nature,

563
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:53,780
if you gaze into their business,
their business also gazes into you.

564
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,614
And I really felt that
I was thinking about this when I read 

565
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:03,550
your book for the.
I would ask you that.

566
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:06,830
How can you be certain that you can 
defeat the,

567
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:10,910
the darkness that when you face that,
I mean it's a.

568
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:16,030
I don't think that you can be certain 
that you can say,

569
00:34:16,031 --> 00:34:16,864
well,
if you go to face the dragon to get the 

570
00:34:18,701 --> 00:34:21,720
gold,
it wouldn't be a dragon if it could meet

571
00:34:21,721 --> 00:34:22,554
you.
The issue isn't that the issue isn't 

572
00:34:26,351 --> 00:34:27,184
that you're certain of success.
The issue is that you don't have a 

573
00:34:30,131 --> 00:34:30,964
better pathway.
And so if you're going to confront the 

574
00:34:34,661 --> 00:34:38,020
dragon of chaos,
say and dare to attain the goal,

575
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,330
then you have to put yourself on the 
line for it.

576
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:41,643
But paradoxically it seems the more 
you're willing to put yourself on the 

577
00:34:44,231 --> 00:34:45,064
line for it,
the higher the probability of your 

578
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:47,284
success.
Which is also the part of opening 

579
00:34:49,301 --> 00:34:52,090
yourself up to the catastrophe.
Knowing.

580
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:52,983
That's why Christianity has increasingly
occupied the theater of in my 

581
00:34:56,681 --> 00:34:59,910
imagination,
because there's this idea that you know,

582
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,780
even speaking psychologically that 
whatever Christ represents,

583
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,363
whatever that image is,
it is in part the call to accept the 

584
00:35:11,261 --> 00:35:12,094
catastrophe of existence,
to accept it voluntarily because the 

585
00:35:15,761 --> 00:35:16,594
fundamental story is that Christ went to
his torturous betrayal with his eyes 

586
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:23,780
open,
right and well,

587
00:35:23,781 --> 00:35:24,890
that's a hell of a thing.

588
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,723
It's no wonder that image has never left
people's imagination because that's the 

589
00:35:29,691 --> 00:35:33,320
reason you can't ask any more of someone
than that

590
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:35,960
and you might say,
well,

591
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:39,240
is it okay that everything will be asked
of us?

592
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,163
And the answer is it doesn't matter 
because everything is going to be asked 

593
00:35:44,661 --> 00:35:45,494
of you like you're going to die.
You're going to have to accept that in 

594
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:49,910
one,
in one form or another.

595
00:35:49,911 --> 00:35:52,660
The question is how well the answer is 
what?

596
00:35:52,661 --> 00:35:55,580
You have to open your arms.
You have to accept it.

597
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,340
You know when there's an idea in the new
testament that if you can,

598
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,410
if you can love fate deeply enough,
you can transfer,

599
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:06,980
you can transcend your limitations of 
your mortality.

600
00:36:06,981 --> 00:36:09,500
It's something like that and you know,
that's,

601
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:12,500
that strikes me as a plausible 
possibility.

602
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,410
Now you said when you were watching all 
those things that,

603
00:36:15,411 --> 00:36:18,600
that changed you.
You mean what did,

604
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,780
what did it change?

605
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:25,530
You realize
what's your facing something real

606
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,720
if evil has,
has meaning,

607
00:36:32,721 --> 00:36:33,554
if there is evil that is evil,
and what if that was sort of then you 

608
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,980
have a terrorist attack in Sweden and in
your,

609
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,430
you started sort of thing.
What would I,

610
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,190
what would I do if I were in that 
situation?

611
00:36:49,191 --> 00:36:53,360
And you speak to people who have,
who have relatives there and you realize

612
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:55,090
that,
uh,

613
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:00,160
you're very lucky but you living in 
Sweden and not there because I,

614
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,560
I,
I think

615
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,230
would not be very hard to take up arms 
against these people.

616
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:12,780
That's the thing is that you realize 
things about yourself if you,

617
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,010
if it gets to that device.

618
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,190
Well,
you know,

619
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:19,070
the terrible thing too is,
and this is a Motif,

620
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,260
again that also runs through 12 rules 
for life,

621
00:37:21,261 --> 00:37:22,700
is that,
well,

622
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:26,860
let's say when the,
when the.

623
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,093
I'll give you a personal example.
So when I heard about what happened in 

624
00:37:30,401 --> 00:37:31,234
Cologne on the new,
on New Year's eve and I see I had a 

625
00:37:34,991 --> 00:37:39,490
situation where my son was mugged a 
number of years ago and he was mugged by

626
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:40,324
a gang of,
of kids that were brought into our 

627
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:46,600
neighborhood as a favor to them so that 
they can play basketball in a local boys

628
00:37:46,601 --> 00:37:47,434
and girls club.
And there was about six or seven of 

629
00:37:49,751 --> 00:37:50,584
them,
18 years old and they mugged my 13 year 

630
00:37:52,811 --> 00:37:54,820
old son and took his,
his,

631
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:55,654
um,
I think they took his cell phone and he 

632
00:37:57,821 --> 00:37:58,654
came home and he was shaken up mostly 
with anger because he couldn't believe 

633
00:38:02,621 --> 00:38:03,454
that six,
18 year old young men could be so 

634
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:09,610
cowardly that they would gang up on a 13
year old kid.

635
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:12,280
Like.
So for him it was a betrayal of humanity

636
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,323
apart from being afraid.
But mostly it was anger on his part and 

637
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:17,763
I was absolutely outraged.
So I contacted the police and I 

638
00:38:21,881 --> 00:38:25,420
contacted the nearby club that had 
sponsored two kids and I said,

639
00:38:25,421 --> 00:38:26,680
look,
this is what happened.

640
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:27,843
And they did nothing about it.
The club knew who it was and wouldn't 

641
00:38:30,881 --> 00:38:31,714
release the names because of 
confidentiality and all sorts of other 

642
00:38:34,151 --> 00:38:39,151
nonsense and I had this fantasy that 
went on for weeks about standing outside

643
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:40,864
the boys and girls club and waiting for 
those kids with a lead pipe because I 

644
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:48,400
was not happy,
but you know,

645
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:52,450
I was and I couldn't pursue it with any 
degree of legal.

646
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,013
I couldn't pursue it to the degree that 
I wanted to in the legal framework 

647
00:38:57,981 --> 00:39:01,550
because at the same time my daughter was
very ill and that was taking precedence.

648
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,383
But you know,
I had these terrible fantasies come up 

649
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:09,470
over and over the very,
very dark fantasies and I talked it over

650
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:10,304
with my son because I told him what was 
happening in my imagination because I 

651
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:15,170
want it to let them know that this 
really bothered me.

652
00:39:15,171 --> 00:39:17,570
That he was attacked and that I wasn't 
going to put up with it.

653
00:39:17,571 --> 00:39:22,080
But I also understood that that's not.
See.

654
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,213
I would have been.
I think I would have been a very weak 

655
00:39:24,931 --> 00:39:29,470
man to not have had those feelings.
And then you think,

656
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:30,304
well,
lots of times it's the better man that 

657
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:33,954
takes up arms,
but it isn't necessarily the best man 

658
00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:41,290
who takes up arms because maybe there's 
a place past that you might say,

659
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:42,124
well,
it's naive it and cowardice that stops 

660
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:46,260
you from defending yourself,
you know,

661
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:50,310
and then you transcend naivety and 
cowardice and then you become dangerous.

662
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:56,570
But maybe you can transcend dangerous.
Maybe there's a place past that.

663
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:00,390
And well,
let's hope there is.

664
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,830
I'm not sure if it's in the book,
but the,

665
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,810
you said it before,
you have to develop some teeth

666
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,713
because you can,
you shouldn't mistake a weakness for 

667
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:19,940
virtue.

668
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,773
Right?

669
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:22,740
And,
but in Christianity,

670
00:40:22,741 --> 00:40:25,870
and one,
one thing that I struggled with,

671
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:29,470
Christianity is the meek shall inherit.

672
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:30,391
Yeah.
But you know,

673
00:40:30,391 --> 00:40:33,250
I read,
I learned it.

674
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:38,960
The other world of Christianity that I 
find very.

675
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,810
I'm not sure if it's a temperamental.

676
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,170
No,
it's a mis translation.

677
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:52,240
I looked that up.
That's a line that always bothered me.

678
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,074
And I,
when I did these biblical lectures last 

679
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,190
year,
which I'm going to continue by the way,

680
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:59,600
as soon as I can possibly manage it.
Um,

681
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,920
I looked up that line,
there's a couple of lines that really,

682
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,200
really,
I couldn't forget them.

683
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,170
I'm the poor,
will always be with us.

684
00:41:10,171 --> 00:41:11,840
That was one,
um,

685
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,473
to those who have everything more shall 
be given from those who have everything 

686
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,240
from those who have nothing.
Everything will be taken away.

687
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,163
That's a rough one.
And then the meek shall inherit the 

688
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:26,420
earth.
But meek is the wrong word.

689
00:41:26,421 --> 00:41:28,880
Has slipped over time.
It doesn't what it meant.

690
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:34,100
If you go back into the original,
if you go back the original texts,

691
00:41:34,101 --> 00:41:36,870
let's say here's a better translation,
um,

692
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,510
those who have swords and know how to 
use them,

693
00:41:40,511 --> 00:41:42,850
but keep the machines will inherit the 
world

694
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:45,983
right

695
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:52,500
on the cheek in
Christianity.

696
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,800
Yeah.
Well that goes along with that.

697
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:56,470
Resist not evil,
but look,

698
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,733
look,
I can tell you some things I've learned 

699
00:41:59,801 --> 00:42:03,760
about that too.
So I'll give you two examples.

700
00:42:03,761 --> 00:42:05,440
So,
you know,

701
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:06,274
there's been a lot of points for me in 
the last 18 months where things could 

702
00:42:09,881 --> 00:42:13,340
have gone badly wrong.
So for example,

703
00:42:13,341 --> 00:42:14,174
I went to mcmaster university about a 
year ago or thereabouts and there was a 

704
00:42:17,571 --> 00:42:20,120
big demonstration and it was quite 
obnoxious.

705
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,750
I mean there was about 200 people there 
that were just see me,

706
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:24,933
came to see me in about 50 protesters 
likely and they drowned me out 

707
00:42:28,251 --> 00:42:29,120
completely.
And,

708
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,610
and,
and there was a handful of them who were

709
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:34,280
really,
I would say really not good people,

710
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:39,680
like most of them were just foolish kids
and foolish self righteous kids who were

711
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:43,130
diluted by the radiant professors and by
their own resentment.

712
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,293
But there were four or five people there
who would have been perfectly happy in 

713
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:50,540
that crowd that you described that 
descended into Iraq.

714
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,030
And I can tell who they were by looking 
at them.

715
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,050
They,
you know,

716
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:55,880
they were people that,
that just,

717
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,290
they just,
I

718
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,430
perhaps I'm wrong.
But I,

719
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,503
I,
I believe that I could see what they 

720
00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:07,120
were.
And there were two of them behind me,

721
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:09,800
woman and a man.
The woman wasn't quite so bad,

722
00:43:09,801 --> 00:43:13,370
but the man was pretty bad and they were
blaring air horns at me,

723
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:16,250
an air horn apnea and close enough to 
damage my hearing,

724
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,190
which I was not the least bit impressed 
about.

725
00:43:19,191 --> 00:43:20,210
And I told them,
I said,

726
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:21,980
look,
you can blow your Damn Air Horn,

727
00:43:21,981 --> 00:43:22,814
but if you get it too close to me.
Well I went and I went and had a word 

728
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:28,460
with the police at that point,
but you know,

729
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,380
so,
so it was quite,

730
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,560
it was quite provoking and,
and,

731
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,840
and pushy,
but I just,

732
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:40,820
I knew that most of it was foolishness 
and

733
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,113
I mostly watched and I tried to give my 
talk and it was completely drowned out 

734
00:43:49,081 --> 00:43:51,780
and then we had to leave and I gave the 
rest of my talk outside.

735
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,613
But you know,
all of that was filmed and then it was 

736
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:59,310
put up on youtube and all of the 
consequences of that holding my temper,

737
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,620
all of the consequences of that was 
positive.

738
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,113
And that's one thing I've really learned
and it is associated with this idea of 

739
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,910
resist not evil and also of turning the 
other cheek.

740
00:44:08,911 --> 00:44:11,610
It's,
it's not like you can't respond,

741
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:16,560
it's that you don't.
And then without Kathy Newman interview,

742
00:44:16,561 --> 00:44:17,820
you know,
it's the same thing.

743
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,920
It's a good really good example of that 
is that

744
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,413
no one,
maybe I managed it because I have had 

745
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:25,623
quite a bit of experience now dealing 
with hostile people and hostile press 

746
00:44:29,861 --> 00:44:31,730
let's say,
but I,

747
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:37,280
I was able fortunately to stay detached 
and,

748
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:38,863
and with,
with maybe with even with a bit of a 

749
00:44:41,521 --> 00:44:42,354
sense of humor during the interview and 
not take it personally and not get 

750
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:47,984
offended by it.
Even though what was happening was 

751
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:53,380
deeply wrong.
There was an element of being able to be

752
00:44:53,381 --> 00:44:56,260
detached about it and that worked,
you know,

753
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:59,800
like I didn't really fight with her.
I didn't allow her to

754
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:03,980
set the linguistic agenda,
let's say,

755
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,430
but I didn't defend myself anymore than 
was absolutely necessary.

756
00:45:09,431 --> 00:45:10,264
You know,
it's minimal necessary for something 

757
00:45:11,861 --> 00:45:16,861
like that and that was overwhelmingly,
it was overwhelmingly well received.

758
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,390
When
you,

759
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:34,190
you're in a public situation,
it's sort of a,

760
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,393
it's a different.
It's different when you meet someone in 

761
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:38,913
streets,
if you're one on one stuff to you or if 

762
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:45,620
you're at a dinner in a personal setting
or something,

763
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:50,360
but when you're in a public setting it's
basically a,

764
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,613
your receiving so you can,
you can be detached because it's not 

765
00:45:55,471 --> 00:46:00,180
really the whole you,
is there an Avatar of yourself,

766
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:05,220
a speaker or a role you inhabit so you 
can have it,

767
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:08,430
you can have patients,
not you,

768
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:09,060
you,
but,

769
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,580
but I mean as a person you don't have to
take it.

770
00:46:11,581 --> 00:46:13,750
So personally I think people make that 
mistake.

771
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:16,500
Yeah.
Well that's,

772
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,333
that's the thing too is like,
it's not easy to know when you should 

773
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,250
take something personally and when you 
shouldn't.

774
00:46:21,251 --> 00:46:26,251
Like I didn't give you a good example of
that too from politics like years ago.

775
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,580
Who was running for.
I think it was Mondale.

776
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:32,890
I think so,
I might have this wrong,

777
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:37,891
but he was um,
he was governor of Massachusetts now.

778
00:46:38,461 --> 00:46:39,360
Who was that?
Who?

779
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:43,560
Who ran for governor of Massachusetts.
Oh.

780
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:48,250
Anyways,
I wasn't Monday,

781
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:49,650
I don't believe,
but it doesn't matter.

782
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:50,703
He,
he was governor of Massachusetts and he 

783
00:46:51,931 --> 00:46:52,764
had released a,
a prisoner or or his or his prison 

784
00:46:56,521 --> 00:46:57,354
system and released to prisoner who 
immediately raped someone and he was 

785
00:47:00,871 --> 00:47:03,630
being raked over the coals on a TV show 
about,

786
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,553
about the fact that this has happened.
I think the rapist name was Willie 

787
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:08,940
Horton,
if I remember correctly.

788
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:10,043
Dukakis was.
It was Dukakis when Dukakis was running 

789
00:47:12,781 --> 00:47:15,720
for president and a journalist asked 
him,

790
00:47:15,721 --> 00:47:17,910
well,
how would you feel if,

791
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,513
um,
Willie Horton had raped your wife or 

792
00:47:21,681 --> 00:47:24,980
your daughter and your CAC is gave a 
very,

793
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:29,900
I would say placid answer,
and it,

794
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,430
it was one of the things that insured,
he was not going to be elected president

795
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,293
president.

796
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:36,343
And what he should have said was my 
imagination would immediately go to the 

797
00:47:40,851 --> 00:47:41,684
darkest possible place,
but because I'm a civilized person and 

798
00:47:45,871 --> 00:47:49,740
understand that that pathway leads to 
nothing but may have,

799
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:51,873
I'd be willing to let the legal system 
take that moral obligation from my 

800
00:47:55,181 --> 00:47:59,380
shoulders because otherwise everything 
gets worse.

801
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,133
That's the right response.
The first response is mess with my 

802
00:48:05,361 --> 00:48:09,920
family at your peril.
And the second response is,

803
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:13,670
yeah,
but I don't get to start a feud.

804
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,833
I don't get to destabilize the entire 
society in my pursuit of what you might 

805
00:48:18,891 --> 00:48:21,930
regard as justifiable revenge.
Right?

806
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,940
And so that's part of that idea of 
having a sword,

807
00:48:25,941 --> 00:48:29,330
but keeping it,
she's right and it is the opposite of,

808
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,750
of,
and I talk about that in rule 11,

809
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,360
don't bother their children were going 
to skateboarding,

810
00:48:35,361 --> 00:48:36,194
which is in part a a,
I suppose a bit of a diatribe against 

811
00:48:39,651 --> 00:48:43,370
the idea that the way that you make men 
good is by making them weak.

812
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:49,420
It's a really uninformed and and naive,
uninformed and malicious idea.

813
00:48:52,631 --> 00:48:54,310
All of those things.
At the same time,

814
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:55,144
you make men good by making them 
unbelievably strong and dangerous and 

815
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:04,210
then asking them politely to hold 
themselves in a band at all times

816
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:09,210
dangerous.
It's just

817
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,190
being strong.
Something.

818
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,133
If you are strong,
then you have the capacity to be 

819
00:49:17,581 --> 00:49:18,530
dangerous,
right?

820
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,950
Something separate from being strong.
So

821
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:24,843
people have misinterpreted sometimes 
when they heard you that they think 

822
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:33,810
you're calling for sort of the British,
a hyper masculine men.

823
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:42,740
But that's not what I heard you say,
I heard you say,

824
00:49:42,741 --> 00:49:47,741
is that if you have somebody who's 
confident and strong in your convictions

825
00:49:48,121 --> 00:49:52,010
and you speak the truth and you're not 
afraid to,

826
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:53,503
uh,
to protest when something is wrong and 

827
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,740
stand up for yourself and stand up for 
people a week and then a protection,

828
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,940
then you're strong and then you can be 
dangerous.

829
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,400
Uh,
but yes.

830
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,740
So,
uh,

831
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,750
have you starting a testosterone or 
something?

832
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,600
I'm not sure.

833
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,950
Right?
Well,

834
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:24,100
of course,
that's exactly for people who are afraid

835
00:50:24,101 --> 00:50:24,934
of who,
for people who are afraid of or hate 

836
00:50:28,371 --> 00:50:32,210
competence,
like to confuse it with tyranny.

837
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,333
And you know,
the mean Joe Rogan is kind of an 

838
00:50:36,621 --> 00:50:38,810
interesting example in that regard 
because,

839
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:39,733
and so is this guy named Jocko willink 
who's got an increasingly popular 

840
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:45,770
podcast and willing because he's a very 
tough guy,

841
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:46,993
you know,
he's very physically intimidating and I 

842
00:50:49,161 --> 00:50:50,810
would say psychologically intimidated

843
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:56,010
comic book character looks and what he 
has done in real life.

844
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:57,820
Exactly,
exactly.

845
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,820
Well,
there's also that.

846
00:51:00,821 --> 00:51:01,654
That's exactly right.
He's articulate and all of those things 

847
00:51:03,341 --> 00:51:04,174
and you know,
and he told me quite clearly that he 

848
00:51:05,951 --> 00:51:09,520
could have easily been like a hyper 
delinquent when he was a kid,

849
00:51:09,521 --> 00:51:11,110
but decided that he was,
because he's,

850
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:11,920
you know,
he's,

851
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,340
he's,
he's an aggressive guy and he decided he

852
00:51:15,341 --> 00:51:16,174
was going to be a good person instead 
and you can't be a good person without 

853
00:51:20,501 --> 00:51:23,470
the capacity for malevolence 
interestingly enough.

854
00:51:23,471 --> 00:51:24,304
And you know,
maybe that's one of the reasons if you 

855
00:51:26,141 --> 00:51:28,850
think about it metaphysically,
let's say.

856
00:51:28,851 --> 00:51:30,470
I mean,
one question is always be,

857
00:51:30,471 --> 00:51:31,100
well,
why?

858
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:31,933
Why is there evil in the world?
And I mean this is only a partial 

859
00:51:34,731 --> 00:51:35,564
answer,
but it's possible that you cannot fully 

860
00:51:38,121 --> 00:51:38,954
develop your capacity for good without 
also developing your capacity for evil 

861
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:46,600
because you have to be able to do things
even if you will do them.

862
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:50,120
I mean,
even if it's a matter of learning how to

863
00:51:50,121 --> 00:51:50,954
withstand temptation and until you're in
a position where that temptation is 

864
00:51:54,021 --> 00:51:56,420
real,
you're not withstanding anything.

865
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:58,723
So you know,
if you're not sleeping with 100 women a 

866
00:52:00,891 --> 00:52:03,170
year because they're not lining up to 
sleep with you,

867
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:05,900
that doesn't make you moral.
It just makes you undesirable.

868
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,793
Yeah.
I also think this is perhaps one of the 

869
00:52:16,661 --> 00:52:21,661
reasons that the bad guys or so
or so

870
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,090
people want to be the bad guy and the 
band guys.

871
00:52:29,091 --> 00:52:29,924
Interesting in movies and
TV series and also this is part of the 

872
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:40,890
is actually a part of Christianity which
I think is very interesting,

873
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:45,891
is that the protocol sheet returning to 
the herb and the protocol and and you,

874
00:52:49,111 --> 00:52:49,944
you find that in
the most awful criminal who's starting 

875
00:52:55,051 --> 00:52:55,884
to have doubts then that's an,
that's a great one of the best 

876
00:52:58,411 --> 00:53:01,090
characters in movies.
I mean the,

877
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:02,363
the awful villain who's having second 
thoughts and then in the end turns out 

878
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:07,630
to have a heart of gold.
Yes,

879
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:08,580
yes,
yes.

880
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,660
But if you,
if you are the lamb that's much more,

881
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,660
that's a boring movie.
Like,

882
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:19,940
like the lamb who's,
who's never done anything wrong.

883
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,610
You can't because you can't.

884
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:24,990
Yeah.
Well there's an.

885
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:29,490
There's an interesting scene in 
revelation in revelation,

886
00:53:29,491 --> 00:53:31,890
which is a very strange book.
It's like a hallucinogenic.

887
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,020
It's like a hallucinogenic trip.
In fact,

888
00:53:34,021 --> 00:53:36,270
I think it probably is a hallucinogenic 
trip.

889
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:40,530
That's my suspicions.
So Christ comes back with a sword in his

890
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:45,180
mouth and he judges humanity and so he's
very merciful in the gospels,

891
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:47,490
but in revelation,
he's the ultimate judge.

892
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:50,970
And the reason for that is that any 
ideal is a judge,

893
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:53,610
right?
If you hold something up as an ideal,

894
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:58,820
then you are reflected poorly in the 
mirror of that ideal.

895
00:53:58,951 --> 00:54:03,951
So it's instantly a judge and there are 
far more damage than saved in,

896
00:54:04,961 --> 00:54:06,660
in,
in the revelation story.

897
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:09,330
But Christ tells people when he judges 
them,

898
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:10,890
um,
I'm,

899
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:12,750
I'm paraphrasing,
but,

900
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:14,610
but,
but the meaning is,

901
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,320
is,
is appropriate.

902
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,170
Um,
if you're hot,

903
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:22,140
that's okay.
That's commendable.

904
00:54:22,141 --> 00:54:24,750
If you're cold,
that's okay.

905
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:28,170
But if you're lukewarm then I'll vomit 
you out of my mouth.

906
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,430
That's the line.
And that's so interesting because it,

907
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:32,161
it's,
it's,

908
00:54:32,161 --> 00:54:34,500
again,
it's an echo of what you just described,

909
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:37,770
is there,
there is no virtue in,

910
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:40,470
in non commitment,
right?

911
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:45,020
There is no virtue in week harmlessness 
in fact it.

912
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,930
And you see that too.
I mean when,

913
00:54:46,931 --> 00:54:49,070
when,
when Hannah wrote,

914
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:53,300
wrote her,
her book on Eichmann in Jerusalem,

915
00:54:53,301 --> 00:54:55,850
it's Eichmann in Jerusalem,
I believe the banality of evil.

916
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:57,863
She talked about Eichmann and Eichmann 
was one of these characters who was a 

917
00:55:00,451 --> 00:55:02,470
lamb,
right?

918
00:55:02,471 --> 00:55:03,310
He,
he,

919
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,200
he was,
he wasn't,

920
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:06,303
you're spectacular cartoon book villain.
He was the harmless kind of soft guy 

921
00:55:12,471 --> 00:55:13,304
next door who sort of went along to get 
along and he happened to be in a 

922
00:55:17,061 --> 00:55:19,940
hierarchy where the goal was to 
eradicate the Jews.

923
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:24,400
But who is he to question the hierarchy?
No one.

924
00:55:24,401 --> 00:55:27,860
So she titled Her Book The banality of 
evil.

925
00:55:27,861 --> 00:55:29,990
And I always thought she had the titled 
Backwards.

926
00:55:29,991 --> 00:55:31,970
It should have been the evil of 
banality.

927
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,093
I haven't thought of that.

928
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:43,160
Yeah,
that's a deep thought.

929
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:49,790
I've read a couple of Christian 
critique.

930
00:55:49,791 --> 00:55:51,270
So your,
your,

931
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,710
uh,
your thoughts and your,

932
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:58,450
your book and one of the,
uh,

933
00:55:58,610 --> 00:55:59,443
one of the critiques was that you,
you think that because people have 

934
00:56:05,991 --> 00:56:10,040
within their grasp to do good and evil 
by themselves,

935
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,233
uh,
your committing to a Christian heresy 

936
00:56:14,031 --> 00:56:15,290
called pelagianism.

937
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,000
Yeah.
See,

938
00:56:17,001 --> 00:56:20,420
I don't really believe that.
I don't really believe that,

939
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:21,770
but it's very difficult

940
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:23,733
because eastern orthodoxy then you can 
only do good because of our sinful 

941
00:56:29,111 --> 00:56:29,944
nature.
You can only do good by the grace of 

942
00:56:31,481 --> 00:56:33,750
God.
So we are,

943
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,360
if we have,
if we are not sinful in our nature,

944
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,870
if we deny that,
then we are basically,

945
00:56:40,871 --> 00:56:41,704
uh,
uh,

946
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,170
having,
uh,

947
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:48,570
committing vanity because we think we 
are so struck by that,

948
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:52,570
that that's a claim that I've seen being
thrown

949
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:55,023
a critique that I was a thought that I 
would like to hear you respond to them 

950
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:00,544
because

951
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:05,130
yeah,
it's an unbelievably deep problem.

952
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,073
So the first thing I would say,
you can only speak metaphorically about 

953
00:57:11,101 --> 00:57:11,934
such things in some sense.
So I would say the Christian claim is 

954
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:20,181
that Christ's sacrifice redeemed us.
And so I would say that's true,

955
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:26,050
but we still have to do the work.
You might say,

956
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:28,420
well,
how can both of those things be the case

957
00:57:28,421 --> 00:57:30,850
simultaneously?
And the answer is,

958
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,950
well,
it depends on your view of time.

959
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:40,640
So and I can't explain it any deeper 
than that,

960
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:43,640
so I'm not going to because it would 
take forever.

961
00:57:43,641 --> 00:57:48,350
But I would also say I do believe that 
you should step forward to do good.

962
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,273
Humbly.
I do believe that if you're going to 

963
00:57:51,441 --> 00:57:52,274
step forward to do good,
that you should do it well guided by 

964
00:57:54,411 --> 00:57:56,390
the,
by the divine images.

965
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:02,870
I do believe that you're likely to err 
in your judgment of what's good,

966
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:03,913
which is why I entitled the chapter,
don't tell the truth or at least don't 

967
00:58:07,341 --> 00:58:08,174
lie.
It isn't obvious to me that you can 

968
00:58:09,471 --> 00:58:10,304
discern the truth,
but it is obvious to me that sometimes 

969
00:58:13,191 --> 00:58:17,660
you know when you're lying and you could
stop doing that.

970
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:23,290
And so I think that those critiques are 
now,

971
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,124
but then I would also invert the 
criticism and I would say that part of 

972
00:58:26,621 --> 00:58:30,640
the danger of modern western 
Christianity in particular.

973
00:58:30,641 --> 00:58:31,474
I don't think this is quite the same 
with the Orthodox Christian types is 

974
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:39,661
that by assuming that everything good is
done by the grace of God,

975
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:44,050
you reduce the burden of the imitation 
of Christ.

976
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:47,710
The question is,
what does it mean to believe in Christ?

977
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,300
Let's say,
and one answer to that would be to say,

978
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:57,070
I regard this statement that Christ's 
crucifixion redeemed me.

979
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:01,660
I regard that statement as true.
Say I'm a Christian.

980
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,280
Okay,
well that's one definition.

981
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:04,323
Here's another definition.
Pick up your cross and walk up the 

982
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:12,751
Goddamn hill and that's the proper 
definition as far as I'm concerned.

983
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:16,580
And so and this is a nichey and critic 
criticism of,

984
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:20,610
of institutionalized Christianity,
which is that it lifts,

985
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:21,463
it made moral board burden to light 
because the burden is supposed to be 

986
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:27,573
confront evil constraint in your own 
heart except the tragedy of being pick 

987
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:35,610
up the load of mortality and walk up 
hill.

988
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,593
It's like,
God,

989
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:40,020
that's rough man.
So and then young wrote about that,

990
00:59:40,021 --> 00:59:40,854
you know,
because he was interested in the 

991
00:59:41,971 --> 00:59:43,680
Nietzschean critique and he said,
look,

992
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:44,543
you got to understand that you can be 
cynical about the Catholics and their 

993
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:51,960
idea that you've been redeemed by an 
external source.

994
00:59:51,961 --> 00:59:52,794
Say it's not that it's not precisely 
that clear will parody a bit for the 

995
00:59:55,621 --> 00:59:58,410
sake of argument and maybe you can also 
be.

996
00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:03,810
I'm cynical about the idea that you can 
go in and confess and receive absolution

997
01:00:03,811 --> 01:00:07,920
and walk out sin free,
but you have to understand is the church

998
01:00:07,921 --> 01:00:08,754
is somewhat merciful and its endeavors 
because it's trying to also free people 

999
01:00:13,081 --> 01:00:16,530
from the intolerable consciousness of 
their own insufficiency.

1000
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,890
You know,
cause I couldn't say to you,

1001
01:00:18,891 --> 01:00:19,724
well,
you need to bear the weight of all your 

1002
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:24,470
transgressions.
It's like Jesus really with no mercy.

1003
01:00:24,471 --> 01:00:27,350
That's how we're going to play this.
Who could tolerate that?

1004
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,930
And the Catholics at least say,
well look,

1005
01:00:29,931 --> 01:00:30,764
you're fallible.
You're going to make all sorts of 

1006
01:00:31,821 --> 01:00:34,250
mistakes.
It's going to happen over and over.

1007
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,600
At least can go in and have the burden 
lifted from time to time.

1008
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:39,434
You're supposed to play it straight.
You're supposed to go in and actually 

1009
01:00:41,421 --> 01:00:44,780
confess and repent and try to do better 
in the future,

1010
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:45,943
but at least you don't have to drag your
catastrophic cell past self along with 

1011
01:00:49,701 --> 01:00:54,510
you every step of the way.
So anyways,

1012
01:00:54,511 --> 01:00:58,510
I'm not trying to elevate human beings 
to the status of demi gods,

1013
01:00:58,511 --> 01:00:59,344
you know,
but I guess I am suggesting that we can 

1014
01:01:01,801 --> 01:01:02,634
at least participate in that to the 
degree that we're willing to hoist our 

1015
01:01:06,601 --> 01:01:07,434
own burdens.
And I do think we should do that with 

1016
01:01:09,301 --> 01:01:13,230
humility and without thinking that we 
can see the way forward.

1017
01:01:13,231 --> 01:01:14,064
So clearly.
I do think we can walk away from 

1018
01:01:17,171 --> 01:01:18,070
Auschwitz though.

1019
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,740
Yeah,
I think so too.

1020
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:24,913
I know.
No,

1021
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:26,410
this was,
uh,

1022
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:29,450
this has been a recurring question for 
you.

1023
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:32,120
I'm not sure if I asked you the last 
time really

1024
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:39,010
it's about truth and how you return to 
the Christianity.

1025
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,740
Some parts of Christianity.
This has been true.

1026
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,970
You said like the truth of the 
individual,

1027
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,620
I think you said,
and how.

1028
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:54,710
My question is how can,
how can be true and,

1029
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:59,210
and um,
four for cs Lewis when he,

1030
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:03,800
when he started like accepted that 
Christianity was true for him,

1031
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:09,130
it was like a mixture.
He was a talked into it by talking and I

1032
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:14,890
don't remember that guy's name with one 
other friend and he said the combination

1033
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:21,160
of a myth or a dying God,
he always loved the dying like diagnosis

1034
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:26,710
and um,
but,

1035
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:27,573
but,
but in Christ it company combining the 

1036
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:33,590
dying God wrote with an actual 
historical figure.

1037
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:37,730
He actually set that this is a,
it's not just a myth.

1038
01:02:37,731 --> 01:02:42,110
It's true.
It's true because it's also historical.

1039
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:45,680
And then he said that,
and then you distinguished.

1040
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:46,743
If you,
if you watch from the outside and 

1041
01:02:48,321 --> 01:02:51,410
analyze it,
well of course you can see that it's,

1042
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:56,940
it's just so you can see similarities as
a scientist,

1043
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,990
but from the inside because if the 
truth.

1044
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,120
And so that was his,
his view of it.

1045
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:08,380
Here's,
here's the strange possibility.

1046
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:09,873
One of the things that's happened to me 
as I've delved farther and farther into 

1047
01:03:12,431 --> 01:03:13,264
religious stories is that I've found 
continually that their depth is 

1048
01:03:16,961 --> 01:03:17,794
inexhaustible.
And at some point it becomes less 

1049
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:22,864
impossible that they're true,
then it is impossible that they're not 

1050
01:03:25,691 --> 01:03:28,030
true.
Something like that now,

1051
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:31,040
okay,
now I'm not.

1052
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,650
So there are,
there are,

1053
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:33,753
there are truths in genesis that are 
unfathomably deep now and I've outlined 

1054
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:43,120
them to the best of my ability in the 
biblical series that I did.

1055
01:03:43,121 --> 01:03:45,610
Now I don't know how to reconcile those 
truths with,

1056
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,013
with,
with,

1057
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:50,710
with the scientific view of the world 
that the view,

1058
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:55,940
the fact that the universe is 14 billion
years old and that we've crawled our way

1059
01:03:57,131 --> 01:03:57,964
up from the sludge and the mod.
I don't know how those things coexist 

1060
01:04:02,081 --> 01:04:02,914
precisely.
I know that there are truths that guide 

1061
01:04:06,161 --> 01:04:09,670
behavior and there are truths that 
describe the material world,

1062
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:11,043
but I certainly don't think that the 
truth that we have that described the 

1063
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:15,280
material world,
our final truths,

1064
01:04:15,281 --> 01:04:18,130
because I don't think our material is 
few point is accurate.

1065
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:20,560
It's accurate for some purposes 
obviously.

1066
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,400
Um,
and I am a practicing scientist and,

1067
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:25,420
and,
and uninformed one,

1068
01:04:25,421 --> 01:04:26,910
I would say,
um,

1069
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:31,240
I don't believe that people act as if 
they confronted material reality.

1070
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,433
I believe that people act as if they 
confront and infinite realm of 

1071
01:04:34,991 --> 01:04:35,824
possibility,
one pole of which is having and the 

1072
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:38,374
other pole of which is held and I 
believe that we treat each other as if 

1073
01:04:42,671 --> 01:04:43,504
that's the world that we live in because
we upgrade each other for not upholding 

1074
01:04:47,231 --> 01:04:48,064
our moral duty and we understand what 
that means and we upgrade ourselves for 

1075
01:04:52,091 --> 01:04:52,924
being less than we could,
and so we confront a world of potential 

1076
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:57,933
and we don't have a good model for that 
and the mythological descriptions 

1077
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:05,910
describe the human being as the eternal 
confronter have a world of potential and

1078
01:05:06,341 --> 01:05:08,110
there's something about that.
It's accurate.

1079
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:09,693
Now,
with regards to this Christian stories 

1080
01:05:11,071 --> 01:05:11,904
specifically,
I do think the idea that that eternal 

1081
01:05:14,351 --> 01:05:15,184
myth was made historically concrete is 
one of the things about Christianity 

1082
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:20,680
that's unalterably powerful.

1083
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:22,263
I don't know what the limits are,
but let's say that what you're called 

1084
01:05:26,301 --> 01:05:27,134
upon to do until in life is to open 
yourself up to the tragedy of being 

1085
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:33,200
completely to.
To accept it,

1086
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:35,720
to welcome it,
even even to love it.

1087
01:05:35,721 --> 01:05:36,554
If you can do that,
and that's no easy thing you watched 

1088
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,130
Iraq being invaded,
there's no easy way of loving.

1089
01:05:43,131 --> 01:05:43,964
Now,
there's no easy way of saying yes to 

1090
01:05:45,171 --> 01:05:48,600
that,
but your job in some sense as a,

1091
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:49,733
as a incarnated finite creature,
is to say yes to the possibilities of 

1092
01:05:54,261 --> 01:05:57,050
being in every possible way.
The question is,

1093
01:05:57,051 --> 01:05:58,610
well,
what's the upper limit to that?

1094
01:05:58,611 --> 01:05:59,444
Like what are the transformations that 
are possible as a consequence of doing 

1095
01:06:02,691 --> 01:06:05,300
that?
And the answer to that is we don't know.

1096
01:06:05,301 --> 01:06:06,134
The Christian story is in part an 
investigation of that is if you're 

1097
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:09,764
willing to accept your.
If you're willing to accept the 

1098
01:06:13,911 --> 01:06:17,480
brutality of the mob,
the betrayal of your friends,

1099
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:21,710
the torture of your existence and your 
unjust death.

1100
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:25,820
If you're willing to accept that and 
welcome it,

1101
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:29,540
what happens to you?
And the answer is

1102
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:36,270
try it and find out
just the

1103
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:41,320
scenario though.
Well,

1104
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,750
you did that in part,
you know,

1105
01:06:42,751 --> 01:06:43,740
when you,
when you were,

1106
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:47,490
when you decided to immerse yourself in 
what was happening in Iraq,

1107
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,140
you know,
you could have looked away.

1108
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,633
Yeah.

1109
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:56,060
Four.
I often find that the,

1110
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:56,800
my,
uh,

1111
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:01,800
my role as a journalist or I'm not a 
real journalist,

1112
01:07:02,431 --> 01:07:04,270
I'm more like an editor.
I'm an editorial right,

1113
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:09,280
that,
but it's sort of a missed between me and

1114
01:07:09,281 --> 01:07:10,950
some reality,
so I could,

1115
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:13,130
I can,
I can do it as a

1116
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:14,880
take on my,

1117
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:19,470
my jackets and then I watched the 
reality through that Lens.

1118
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:23,880
So it sort of shields me from some,
some of it.

1119
01:07:23,881 --> 01:07:24,714
But

1120
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:25,643
yeah.
Well that's the advantage of having a 

1121
01:07:26,771 --> 01:07:30,570
well developed persona from the union 
perspective.

1122
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:33,010
You know,
you put on an image like,

1123
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:36,720
like Clark Kent,
Superman puts on Clark Kent.

1124
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:40,950
That's why superheroes always having a 
normative alter ego,

1125
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:42,443
right?
They have to be able to live in the 

1126
01:07:43,141 --> 01:07:44,280
normal world.
Right?

1127
01:07:44,281 --> 01:07:47,010
So you need to have an element of 
yourself that can,

1128
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:50,760
that can exist.
Well,

1129
01:07:50,761 --> 01:07:53,190
they can act as a mask between you and 
the world.

1130
01:07:53,191 --> 01:07:55,920
I suppose that's what a persona is.
So,

1131
01:07:55,921 --> 01:07:59,310
but I mean to the degree that you're 
able to open your eyes,

1132
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:00,500
you know,
neat.

1133
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,333
You also said you could determine the 
depth of a man's character by observing 

1134
01:08:05,401 --> 01:08:10,250
how much truth he's willing to tolerate.
Right?

1135
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:11,170
Right.
Which is,

1136
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:12,161
you know,
you think,

1137
01:08:12,161 --> 01:08:15,010
well,
how can that be associated with the idea

1138
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:17,150
of the truth will set you free.
It's like,

1139
01:08:17,151 --> 01:08:18,260
well,
it might set you free,

1140
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:21,200
but it will take you places you're not 
sure you want to go first.

1141
01:08:22,930 --> 01:08:23,763
Yeah.
In the movie matrix when neo wakes up 

1142
01:08:31,651 --> 01:08:36,651
and he's flushed down the drain pipe,
woken up to this awful,

1143
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:40,230
awful world.
And that's reality.

1144
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:46,080
That's the truth of the underworld
and it's an old truth.

1145
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:53,430
Uh,
hopefully the truth is not all the time.

1146
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:54,491
Yeah.
Well,

1147
01:08:54,491 --> 01:08:55,340
you know,
there's an old.

1148
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:56,283
Well,
the funny thing is that there's an old 

1149
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:00,280
Christian idea too,
that when Christ was crucified,

1150
01:09:00,281 --> 01:09:02,680
he went and harrowed hell before he rose
to heaven.

1151
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:07,060
It's like there is this idea that you 
don't go up without going down.

1152
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:11,500
And I really do believe that's true.
And I think that maybe see,

1153
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:13,203
one of the images in genesis that's 
really hard to understand is that when 

1154
01:09:15,911 --> 01:09:16,744
God throws Adam and Eve out of paradise,
he puts an angel at the gates of 

1155
01:09:21,431 --> 01:09:25,840
Paradise with with flaming swords to 
borrow the way you might think,

1156
01:09:25,841 --> 01:09:26,674
well,
why would God bar the way to paradise 

1157
01:09:28,811 --> 01:09:33,340
with with flaming swords?
And maybe the flaming swords cut all the

1158
01:09:33,341 --> 01:09:35,830
dead wood off before you step through 
the gate.

1159
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:38,590
And if you're all dead wood,
then there's nothing left of you.

1160
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:43,450
Once the flaming swords are done with 
you and to observe what you observe with

1161
01:09:43,451 --> 01:09:46,060
the Iraq invasion,
that's a set of flaming swords.

1162
01:09:46,061 --> 01:09:46,894
You know,
because what you're watching is what 

1163
01:09:47,831 --> 01:09:50,680
human beings are like and you happen to 
be one.

1164
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:54,220
And to the degree that you're like that,
that's you doing that.

1165
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:58,240
That's a hell of a thing too.
That's a hell of a thing to realize.

1166
01:09:58,270 --> 01:09:58,781
You think,
well,

1167
01:09:58,781 --> 01:10:01,060
what's the right response to watching 
that?

1168
01:10:01,061 --> 01:10:06,061
And I would say to stop being an evil 
person and now it's no simple thing.

1169
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:08,373
One of the things with these people that
met goes there and during the Icelandic 

1170
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:15,870
state,
they're evil,

1171
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:20,690
they're just,
a lot of them are evil.

1172
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:21,663
Of course they are psychopaths and are,
and if you are a psychopath and you 

1173
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:26,573
really want to do violence,
that's a great place to be and you can 

1174
01:10:29,711 --> 01:10:30,544
probably do great there.
But there are also people joining the 

1175
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:35,160
error.
Really.

1176
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:36,003
They want to do good.
They just really a really twisted sense 

1177
01:10:39,691 --> 01:10:40,524
of what's good.
And that's one of the most depressing 

1178
01:10:43,411 --> 01:10:44,690
things about,
uh,

1179
01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:48,100
Islamic state is that some of the people
that go there,

1180
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:49,993
uh,
they do horrible things and then they 

1181
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:54,790
regret themselves.
But I mean,

1182
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:58,900
how could you let them back into society
after what they've done?

1183
01:10:59,610 --> 01:11:00,443
Yeah.

1184
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:03,600
Yeah.
So,

1185
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:08,060
so it's
the power of ideas is you can,

1186
01:11:08,061 --> 01:11:13,061
you can convert people that under others
circumstances would have done,

1187
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:14,383
done good.

1188
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:18,710
The tools so evil and stuff.
Well,

1189
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:22,770
this is partly why I tried in some sense
are allowed,

1190
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:23,783
in some sense,
12 rules and my lectures as well to be 

1191
01:11:26,071 --> 01:11:26,904
so harsh because imagine that there are 
many young men who are looking for an 

1192
01:11:30,211 --> 01:11:33,120
adventure.
They need an adventure,

1193
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:34,950
right?
They need an adventure,

1194
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:36,413
and maybe their normative life is 
sufficiently soft and undemanding so 

1195
01:11:40,201 --> 01:11:41,034
that they could recede into a kind of 
domestic unconsciousness as an 

1196
01:11:45,061 --> 01:11:45,894
alternative,
but there's nothing in that except a 

1197
01:11:48,301 --> 01:11:53,301
prolonged prolonged non-existence,
self contempt and bitterness,

1198
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:54,900
right?
It's not good.

1199
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,450
You need to be called to an adventure,
and so I would say,

1200
01:11:57,451 --> 01:11:58,284
well look,
this is what etiologies offer young 

1201
01:12:02,191 --> 01:12:04,920
people is the call to an adventure,
but it's a false adventure.

1202
01:12:04,921 --> 01:12:05,940
I would say instead,
look,

1203
01:12:05,941 --> 01:12:08,160
you want an adventure is open up your 
eyes,

1204
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,010
open up your eyes to what the world is 
really like,

1205
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:14,550
and then take your place in it as a 
productive,

1206
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,840
awake,
attentive,

1207
01:12:15,841 --> 01:12:19,770
and truthful being and see how far you 
can walk up hill.

1208
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:24,150
That's an adventure.
It's the alternative to the call to war,

1209
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,670
right?
Because the call to wars and adventure,

1210
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:31,850
William James said a 130 140 years ago,
we need a moral equivalent to war

1211
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:36,031
and,
and,

1212
01:12:36,031 --> 01:12:36,864
and,
and it touches on exactly what you're 

1213
01:12:38,011 --> 01:12:41,100
saying is these,
these kids who are lost,

1214
01:12:41,101 --> 01:12:41,934
let's say,
and maybe somewhat bitter and resentful 

1215
01:12:43,771 --> 01:12:47,550
as a consequence.
They see in Isis a call to adventure.

1216
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,300
Well,
you know,

1217
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:51,833
I understand that.
I saw this kid once in Montreal and an 

1218
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:56,334
outside shopping mall.
He was about six foot five and he was 

1219
01:12:58,471 --> 01:13:00,360
dressed up like a punk rocker,
you know,

1220
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:05,430
and he was standing on the corner with 
two pink shopping bags in his hand and I

1221
01:13:05,431 --> 01:13:06,264
thought,
what a ridiculous figure he cut because 

1222
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:11,070
he was all dressed up like a viking.
Right?

1223
01:13:11,071 --> 01:13:13,800
He was ready to go out there and have 
his damn adventure.

1224
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:14,633
And what he was doing instead was 
standing in an outdoor shopping mall 

1225
01:13:17,191 --> 01:13:19,080
with two pink shopping bags.
It's like,

1226
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:21,750
come up to a kid like that and you say,
hey,

1227
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,080
you want to go get into some trouble,
some interesting trouble.

1228
01:13:25,081 --> 01:13:28,770
He's gonna like throw those shopping 
bags away and come with you instantly.

1229
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:29,881
It's like,
okay,

1230
01:13:29,881 --> 01:13:31,760
well you need some interesting trouble.
Well,

1231
01:13:31,761 --> 01:13:33,090
what could that be?
Well,

1232
01:13:33,091 --> 01:13:35,340
here's something.
Get your act together,

1233
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:38,460
discipline yourself,
look at the world,

1234
01:13:38,461 --> 01:13:41,250
see if you can find a problem to solve,
grow up.

1235
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:42,843
You know,
when.

1236
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:43,733
What's so interesting.
One of the things that's been so 

1237
01:13:45,241 --> 01:13:46,074
interesting to me to observe as a 
consequence of what I've been talking 

1238
01:13:49,891 --> 01:13:54,891
about is just how many people are 
starving for that message.

1239
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:57,063
You know,
I have after my talks now say I was in 

1240
01:14:00,001 --> 01:14:00,834
La and about 700 people lined up 
afterwards to have a book signed and 

1241
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:05,580
they,
all,

1242
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:06,413
the vast majority of them have a story 
to tell and so the little exchanges I 

1243
01:14:09,841 --> 01:14:11,880
have with people are very intense,
you know,

1244
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,280
because they want to have a minute to 
tell me what's happening and,

1245
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:18,070
or 30 seconds even and they say,
look,

1246
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:23,110
here was 10 things going terribly wrong 
with my life and I've been trying to aim

1247
01:14:23,921 --> 01:14:25,810
up and say what I have to say it.

1248
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:30,250
Everything's much better.
Thank you very much and I thank God,

1249
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,473
good work,
and then the next person comes up and 

1250
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:37,480
says the same thing and I've got like 
25,000 letters that have said that since

1251
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:39,250
August.
And so,

1252
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:40,653
you know,
there is a way of calling people to an 

1253
01:14:41,921 --> 01:14:44,170
adventure that perhaps isn't 
destructive.

1254
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:47,650
They have enough right in front of them 
to have a great adventure if they're,

1255
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:49,300
if they're willing,
let's say,

1256
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:53,350
to try not to lie and to tell the truth 
and to aim up hill.

1257
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:55,660
Maybe that adventures right in front of 
us.

1258
01:14:55,661 --> 01:14:56,494
Maybe that's part of,
maybe that's part of the process of 

1259
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:03,880
engendering paradise,
to find the adventure in,

1260
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:06,920
in,
to find the proper divide.

1261
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:08,391
Excuse me,
to,

1262
01:15:08,391 --> 01:15:11,720
to find the divine adventure in every 
individual life.

1263
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,433
That's the,
that's that union of the divine and the 

1264
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:17,550
historical and Christianity too,
right?

1265
01:15:17,551 --> 01:15:19,270
It's to make the archetype real.

1266
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:24,683
Number six,
set your house in perfect order before 

1267
01:15:27,511 --> 01:15:32,511
you criticize the world.
I think that also you begin,

1268
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:36,060
you begin with yourself and you start to
be,

1269
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,160
be the change,
so to speak.

1270
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:39,670
And that's,
uh,

1271
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:41,760
a way of,
um,

1272
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:46,320
being
bitter against the world,

1273
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:48,480
at least not to begin with.

1274
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:50,390
At least that's right.
It's a start.

1275
01:15:50,391 --> 01:15:52,340
You can say to yourself,
look,

1276
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:57,190
everything looks pretty terrible to me.
What the hell?

1277
01:15:57,580 --> 01:15:58,413
How can it be this way?
But then you can take the next step and 

1278
01:16:00,731 --> 01:16:01,564
say,
yeah,

1279
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:06,400
maybe I not everything I could be.
So how about if I try to be everything I

1280
01:16:06,401 --> 01:16:07,234
could be?
And then think about it again later and 

1281
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:11,713
it's the right.
That's because the alternative to that 

1282
01:16:13,631 --> 01:16:15,190
is just a catastrophe,
right?

1283
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,880
That's the key to dignity,
right?

1284
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:23,390
Can Be dignified.
Even if you're,

1285
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:25,890
you're not the best,
strongest,

1286
01:16:26,270 --> 01:16:27,470
most beautiful love.
If you,

1287
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:32,260
if you set yourself in order and you 
take yourself seriously,

1288
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:33,183
then you can have dignity and other 
people will notice it and you will 

1289
01:16:35,861 --> 01:16:36,694
notice it.
That's a great place to start from and 

1290
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:42,950
to strive for,
and that's one of the most.

1291
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:45,640
One of the best things about your book 
really,

1292
01:16:45,641 --> 01:16:49,330
that you,
you bring dignity into,

1293
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:53,240
I think,
bring to people's lives with this book.

1294
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:54,074
Go with your lecturers.
One of the takeaways I have from 

1295
01:16:57,890 --> 01:16:58,723
speaking with people,
because after the last interview I did 

1296
01:17:02,490 --> 01:17:05,420
and then people read the piece I wrote 
and then people,

1297
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:09,030
a lot of people thank me for introducing
you to

1298
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:15,790
and then that's been one of the 
recurring themes.

1299
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:22,270
I feel so much a strongly themselves,
so some of them at least.

1300
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:25,770
I think that's a great.
That's a great observation.

1301
01:17:25,771 --> 01:17:26,604
I mean,
you know our society's week because we 

1302
01:17:28,861 --> 01:17:32,520
think about happiness.
Why don't we think about dignity?

1303
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:33,653
Why don't we think about mobility?
Why don't we think about truth and 

1304
01:17:35,941 --> 01:17:38,850
responsibility or beauty.
All of those things there.

1305
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:39,953
They're much.
They're the values that sustain you 

1306
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:45,390
through suffering.
Happiness cannot do that.

1307
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:50,380
Not that happiness is is to be to be 
what?

1308
01:17:50,930 --> 01:17:51,763
There's no,
there's no utility in contempt for 

1309
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:56,070
happiness.
Thank God if it comes,

1310
01:17:56,730 --> 01:17:57,563
but dignity mean we can't even.
When is the last time you heard someone 

1311
01:18:01,441 --> 01:18:02,274
talk about that?
Even part of the public discourse and 

1312
01:18:07,141 --> 01:18:08,220
it's so crucial.

1313
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:17,760
It's not something you strive for it too
much.

1314
01:18:17,761 --> 01:18:19,080
You won't get it.

1315
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:22,290
Do you mean dignity or happiness?
Happiness.

1316
01:18:24,290 --> 01:18:25,051
Definitely.
Well,

1317
01:18:25,051 --> 01:18:28,290
you might say if you strive for dignity 
and truth,

1318
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,690
sometimes you'll be rewarded with 
happiness.

1319
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:32,643
Right.
That's a grace of God that that 

1320
01:18:34,321 --> 01:18:35,154
happiness,
that's not something you can conjure up 

1321
01:18:36,871 --> 01:18:39,330
on your own.
Good luck trying.

1322
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:42,483
So I think I've taken up almost two 
hours of your time and we write the 

1323
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:48,514
piece,
makes the interview with the book and 

1324
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:56,203
also just I was writing this piece and 
it was 18,000 characters and I was just 

1325
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,220
so stressed out and I was telling my 
wife,

1326
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:08,400
it's like fighting.
It hydrates,

1327
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:12,490
new heads coming up all the time and she
was just laughing at me like,

1328
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:14,170
oh,
you read too much.

1329
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,820
He's invaded your language either.

1330
