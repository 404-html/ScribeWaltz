1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,550
Yeah,

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,290
so I want to tell you,
I'm going to make an a little

3
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:18,590
announcement first.
I'm going to do a series of lectures,

4
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:22,880
I think starting in May,
maybe at the Isabel Bader theater.

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,400
We're trying to look into booking that
on.

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,910
I'm going to do a psychological
interpretation of the Bible from

7
00:00:28,911 --> 00:00:30,920
beginning to end.
That's the plan anyway,

8
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:33,890
so I'm going to do that once a week.
So if you're interested in,

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,100
in that,
I would recommend that you men,

10
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:38,870
maybe you're not and that's fine
obviously,

11
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:42,200
but if you go onto my twitter account,
you could just,

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,870
there's a place you can sign up.
It doesn't mean that you'll attend.

13
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:47,270
I'm just trying to see if there are
people who are interested in.

14
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:50,510
I'd been interested in doing that for a
long time and so I think I'm going to

15
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:51,830
try it.
So anyways,

16
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,550
that's the announcement then.
Sad about it.

17
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,330
I guess so.

18
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,170
Okay.
So look,

19
00:00:57,171 --> 00:00:59,370
we're going to switch gears today.
Um,

20
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,630
the first half of this course as you've
no doubt already gathered is because

21
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:08,910
it's round grounded essentially in
clinical theories of personality.

22
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:12,020
It tends more towards the philosophical
and I told you that the reason for that

23
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:16,520
was that I regard clinical psychology as
a branch of engineering rather than a

24
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:19,220
branch of science.
It's human engineering obviously,

25
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:23,210
and because of that it's an applied
science and so that means it straddles

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,360
the ground between a science and a
practice and it and because it's.

27
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,950
It involves human beings.
It necessarily involves value because we

28
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,780
live inside value structures and so the
logical consequence of that is that

29
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,740
investigation into the philosophy of
value is necessary in order to

30
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:46,370
understand clinical psychological
theories.

31
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,470
Because really what you're trying to do
as a clinician,

32
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,240
you could say you're trying to do two
things.

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,060
One is to help people have less terrible
lives,

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,080
but you're also trying to help them have
better lives and there's obviously a

35
00:01:57,081 --> 00:02:01,820
value structure that's inherent in that
attempt because you're moving from

36
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:05,900
something of less value to something of
more value and so and it's best to just

37
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:11,270
face that and all the complexities that
come along with that head on.

38
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,510
Now.
I think what you do as a clinician to

39
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:18,560
overcome whatever tendency you might
have to impose your value structure on

40
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:22,520
someone is you do an awful lot of
listening and so my basic practice with

41
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:24,500
people is to say to them,
well,

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,320
obviously you're here because you would
like things to be better,

43
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,500
but that's okay.
We can use your definition of what

44
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:33,320
constitutes better.
We can use your definition of what

45
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:37,460
constitutes worse at air or we can
establish that through dialogue and

46
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:38,294
negotiation.

47
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,330
What are you aiming at?
How would you like things to be better a

48
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,510
year from now safe?
If you could have what you wanted?

49
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,150
If your life was put together,
what would that look like and you can

50
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:50,450
have a very straightforward discussion
with people about that.

51
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,680
If you're not trying to cram the way
that are orienting the world into your

52
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:57,980
particular perspective.
Now that's one of the dangers of being

53
00:02:57,981 --> 00:03:00,520
the adherent of a psychological school.
Now,

54
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:05,521
having said that,
it's also there was research done many

55
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,190
years ago showing that if you are an
eclectic psychotherapists best,

56
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:12,400
which means that you sort of picked and
chose from different psychotherapeutic

57
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,040
schools.
You tended to not be as effective as you

58
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,160
were if you were the dedicated adherent
of a given school.

59
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,190
And I think the reason for that is that
there's so many schools have

60
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:25,330
psychological thought that if you say
that you pick and choose from all of

61
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:25,480
them.

62
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,180
What that really means is that you don't
know anything about any of them.

63
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,630
And then there's also the additional
factor maybe might call it that.

64
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,500
If someone comes to you and they're very
chaotic and confused,

65
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,820
helping them impose any structure onto
their life is likely to be an

66
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:46,210
improvement over no structure at all.
And you could think about that in a pig,

67
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:50,290
Eddie and sense is that you know you're
going to be happier playing a game

68
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,380
rather than no game.
And there's many games that you could

69
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:56,560
play that are better than no game.
And so if you go to a therapist that has

70
00:03:56,561 --> 00:04:00,520
a particular viewpoint and they help you
structure your understanding of the

71
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:05,350
world within the confines of a given
clinical model and you came in,

72
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:08,800
they're very chaotic and uncertain,
then maybe that's going to be a lot

73
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:10,540
better for you than just floundering.

74
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,340
And I,
and I think there's some real truth in

75
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:14,650
that.
And I think that that's part and parcel

76
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:16,090
of the same,
uh,

77
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,210
of another,
what you might call it,

78
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,900
reasonable observation about maturation,
is that it's very necessary for people

79
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:26,710
at some point in their life to dedicate
themselves to a single game of some

80
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:28,090
sort,
which is kind of what you're doing in

81
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,050
university.
You know,

82
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,680
you have to become one thing at some
point in your life.

83
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:35,860
And the sacrifice of course,
is that you give up all the other things

84
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:37,840
that you could become.
But the,

85
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,380
you don't really have a choice because
if you don't decide voluntarily to

86
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,510
become one thing,
you know,

87
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,540
to become a disciplined adherents of
some specific,

88
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,000
uh,
uh,

89
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:53,370
practice or profession or viewpoint,
then you risk just aging chaotically and

90
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,530
you,
you don't get away with not aging.

91
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:59,200
So you might as well age into something
that's,

92
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,160
that's actually something rather than
just remaining or then just becoming an

93
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:05,080
old child,
which is really not a,

94
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,010
not a good thing.

95
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,130
It's not a good thing to see.
Especially by the time people hit about

96
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:10,060
40.
It's not,

97
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,530
it's not,
it's not pretty for them or anyone else.

98
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,990
And even at 30,
it's getting pretty old at that point.

99
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,090
40.
It's like it's almost a repairable at

100
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:21,110
40.
And the reason for that is you run and

101
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,860
you start running out of opportunities
when you're young and stupid.

102
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:25,930
People don't care because they think,
well,

103
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:27,310
you know,
whatever,

104
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,860
you've got decades of,
of,

105
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,340
of possibility still ready to unfold in
you.

106
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:37,600
But if you're in the same unspecified
position at 40,

107
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,110
people are much less forgiving.
Especially because if they're going to

108
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:45,310
hire someone who doesn't know what's
going on or or employ them or or sorry

109
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,860
or engage them in some sort of
productive activity,

110
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,430
they might as well take a chance on
someone young and full of potential

111
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:54,940
rather than someone who's really lived
more than half of their life already

112
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,500
because of course you have by the time
you're 40 more that.

113
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,320
Okay,
so so anyway,

114
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,660
so that's with regards to putting the
first half of the course to bed,

115
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:06,260
so to speak.
The second half is more more scientific

116
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,330
and there's a bit of a gap that,
and it's a gap I'm trying to resolve

117
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,760
conceptually because now we move into
more biological models and into models

118
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:21,761
that are psychometric and psychometrics
is the psychological study or the study

119
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:25,430
of psychological measurement and now if
you're a scientist,

120
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,400
you're.
There's a couple of things that you're

121
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:32,060
obliged to do if you're a scientist.
One is to utilize the scientific method.

122
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:36,830
That's usually the experimental method
where you take two groups randomly

123
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,430
selected,
apply a manipulation to one of them and

124
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,790
not an equivalent manipulation of a
different source to another.

125
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,350
Hypothesize about what the outcome is
likely to be and then test it.

126
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,580
Uh,
that's,

127
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:52,100
that's the technical experimental model
anyways.

128
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,340
You're also obliged as a scientist to
come up with a measurement of your,

129
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,010
of your,
uh,

130
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,840
to come up with a measurement.
Let's just put it that way.

131
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,090
That's reliable and valid.
Okay.

132
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:09,710
And what a reliable measure is one that
measures the same way across multiple

133
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:11,210
measurements.
So for example,

134
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:16,310
you wouldn't want to take a ruler that's
made out of flexible rubber to measure

135
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,250
things with because it wouldn't give you
the same measurement if you put it in

136
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:22,610
different situations.
That's reliability and it's a term you

137
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:25,370
need to know.
It means that the measurement tool

138
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:28,910
produces stable results across different
instances of the measurement.

139
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,160
Without that,
you don't have a measurement.

140
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,580
The other critical
factor with regards to a measurement is

141
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:42,020
that it has to be valid,
which means that it actually has to

142
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,050
measure what it purports to measure and
it has to be usable for an array of

143
00:07:47,211 --> 00:07:49,100
different purposes as a consequence.

144
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,420
And so you might think,
well,

145
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:53,630
the purpose of scientific endeavor is to
predict and to control.

146
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,340
You could say understand,
predict,

147
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,040
and control,
but understanding prediction and

148
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:02,630
controls are all manifestations of the
same underlying

149
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,290
thoroughly designed comprehension.
Now,

150
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,970
here's what's happened with the
measurement of personality.

151
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,070
It's a funny story in some sense,
a peculiar story because

152
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,140
in many ways what we've come to
understand about personality from a

153
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:26,141
scientific perspective developed in a
very atheoretical manner.

154
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:30,740
It's not very common in scientific
endeavor that that occurs is that what

155
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:35,120
we know about personality emerged from,
I would say statistically rigorous

156
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:39,350
observation without it being the
consequence of any real model.

157
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:45,130
So often what happens in scientific
endeavor is that someone generates a

158
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:47,090
model first,
a theoretical understanding,

159
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,690
and then they generate measurement tools
based on that theoretical understanding

160
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,470
and then they test the measurement tools
to see if all of the measurement tools

161
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:58,680
perform and if they fail,
at least to invalidate the underlying

162
00:08:58,681 --> 00:08:59,010
theory.

163
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,170
That isn't what happened with
psychometrics,

164
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,900
what except in a loose way.
So here's the loose theory and you've

165
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:09,450
got to get this exactly right to
understand this property.

166
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:13,500
You've got to get it exactly right and
it's really important because in so far

167
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:15,120
as you guys are interested in
psychology,

168
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,130
especially in the experimental end of
psychology,

169
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:22,290
measurement is everything and so much of
what psychologists publish and write

170
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:26,010
about is incorrect and the reason it's
incorrect is because they do not have

171
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:28,470
their measurements properly instantiate
it.

172
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,380
It's a massive problem.
Especially in social psychology.

173
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,930
In fact,
it's probably a fatal problem in that

174
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:37,880
most of the things that social
psychologists measure don't exist and in

175
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,550
social psychology has been rife with
scandals for the last four or five years

176
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,820
and and there's good reason for it,
but a big part of the problem is is that

177
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,620
the measurement that people are not
stringent and careful enough about their

178
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:50,040
measurements.

179
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,080
So we're gonna walk through this very,
very carefully.

180
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:56,010
So I'm going to set forward a set of
propositions and you have to think about

181
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:58,200
them because each of them are there
axiomatic.

182
00:09:58,201 --> 00:10:01,290
So you sort of have to accept them
before you go onto the next step.

183
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,510
And there's certainly room to question
them.

184
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,830
But here's the bare bones of the
psychometric of model of personality,

185
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:11,640
so we'll call it roughly the big five
model and the reason it's called the big

186
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:15,990
five model is because the psychometric
investigations have indicated that you

187
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:20,070
can specify human personality along five
basic dimensions.

188
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,121
You might ask,
well,

189
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,930
what exactly is personality?
And while that's partly what we've been

190
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:27,240
trying to wrestle with the entire course
so far,

191
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:30,410
and I would say,
or what exactly is a trait?

192
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,300
Think of a trait has an element of
personality.

193
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,710
And I think the best way to think about
a trait is as a subpersonality,

194
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,010
so you're,
you're made up of sub personalities that

195
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:44,340
are integrated into something vaguely
resembling a unity.

196
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,950
But the unity is,
is diverse.

197
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:47,820
There are,
there are,

198
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,300
there are,
there are describable stable elements

199
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:54,900
that characterize you,
that are elements of your being.

200
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:55,950
So for example,
here's,

201
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:57,900
here's some common ones I might say,
well,

202
00:10:57,901 --> 00:11:00,450
are you social or,
or would you rather be alone?

203
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:00,740
So,
uh,

204
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,430
here's,
here's a good question for you to

205
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:04,500
define.
Decide whether you're extroverted or

206
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:06,210
introverted.
It's pretty straightforward because

207
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:08,130
that's,
that's the first major dimension.

208
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,360
Basically,
if you take any set of questions about

209
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,760
any,
any set of questions that could be

210
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:19,761
applied descriptively to a human being
and you subject them to a statistical

211
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:23,890
process called factor analysis,
you can determine how they grouped

212
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,530
together.
So what I would be interested in,

213
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:30,060
let's say I asked you 100 questions,
let's say asked 100 questions of you and

214
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,810
a hundred other people.
What I would find was that reliably,

215
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,610
if some person answered question a say
on a scale of one to seven,

216
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,420
six or seven,
there would be other questions in the

217
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:47,421
set of questions that they also tended
to answer on the upper end of the scale

218
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,640
or reliably if they answered one
question at the top of the scale data

219
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,320
answer another question at the bottom
that's a pattern of covariation.

220
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,540
So you're looking for how the questions
co-vary across large numbers of people.

221
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,210
So let's say here's a stupid example,
but it's.

222
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,700
It's really,
it's really straightforward,

223
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:07,960
easy to understand.
I might say,

224
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,680
how often do you smile?
One to seven.

225
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,380
How often are you happy?
One to seven.

226
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,960
Well,
what you'd find obviously is that people

227
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:19,480
who tended to answer that they smiled a
lot,

228
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:22,900
would also tend to answer that they were
happy a lot and so smiling and happy are

229
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:26,230
not exactly the same thing,
which is why we have two different

230
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:29,590
phrases to describe them,
but they're close enough so that they

231
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:32,230
seem to be reflective of some underlying
structure,

232
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,610
and so that's what factor analysis does,
is it allows you to take a large set of

233
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:40,480
questions to administer it to a large
number of people and then to

234
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:43,780
statistically analyze it.
Looking how the questions relate to one

235
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:48,280
another across the entire group so that
you can infer what the underlying

236
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:49,114
structure is.

237
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,620
And here,
here's the question.

238
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:53,200
In some sense,
if I ask you 100 questions,

239
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,570
how many questions am I really asking
you?

240
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,370
Because you might say,
well,

241
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,880
are you do you smile a lot?
Are you happy?

242
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,480
Do you wake up eager to start the day?
You say,

243
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:08,590
well,
is that one question asked three ways,

244
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,740
or is it three separate questions?
And the answer is,

245
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:15,370
well,
if the answer's reliably co-vary,

246
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,880
then it's reflection of an underlying
single dimension.

247
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,290
Now obviously those questions are
slightly different now,

248
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,730
but they'll relate to one another
sustainably.

249
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,740
And so you can infer out the central
stable factors.

250
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:32,180
Now it might be the case that.
So here's,

251
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,070
here's an example,
because you might ask how many stable

252
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,680
underlying dimensions are there?
In any set of questions,

253
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:43,510
if I ask you questions that relate to
your capacity to manipulate

254
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:47,290
abstractions,
all find that there's one factor.

255
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,350
So imagine you had an infinite library
of problem solving questions.

256
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,850
Doesn't matter what they are.
Capital of Georgia.

257
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,830
Here's the sequence,
two,

258
00:13:56,831 --> 00:13:57,611
four,
six,

259
00:13:57,611 --> 00:13:58,271
eight,
10.

260
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,640
What's the next number?
Here's five patterns.

261
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,530
Here's and,
and they,

262
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,340
they transform predictably across the
pattern array.

263
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,130
Here's five alternatives that the next
pattern might be.

264
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:12,070
Pick that one here.
Here's 10 words,

265
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:14,110
tell me what they mean.
Anything like that.

266
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:16,120
Here's a mathematical operation
computed,

267
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,730
anything like that.
Imagine you had a very large library of

268
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:20,590
questions like that.
Okay?

269
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:23,470
And Infinite Library.
And you took random sets of 100

270
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:27,760
questions from that library and you gave
that those cassettes to a thousand

271
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:32,340
people.
What you'd find was that people who and

272
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,420
the score,
so you gave them a hundred questions and

273
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:37,090
then you summed across all the items to
see how well they did.

274
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,590
What you'd find was that people who did
very well on one set of items would do

275
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:44,920
very well on another set of items and
very well have another set of items.

276
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,490
And that would be the same for people
who did badly if they did badly on any

277
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:51,830
one of the sets of randomly chosen items
of abstraction.

278
00:14:51,831 --> 00:14:55,010
They do badly on the rest.
That's basically Iq.

279
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,070
That's all there is to it.
So it.

280
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,220
What Iq does is correct that for age.
But other than that,

281
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:03,830
that's all there is to it.
And the thing that's interesting about

282
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:09,820
those random sets of abstract problem
solving questions is there's one

283
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,890
dimension,
that's it.

284
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:16,180
Intelligence has one dimension,
and it's one of the most terrifying

285
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,760
statistics that are known to social
scientists.

286
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:23,440
And Iq is an extraordinarily powerful
predictor of longterm success,

287
00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:26,650
especially in complex jobs.
And the reason for that,

288
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:31,770
it's quite straightforward.
Most complex jobs throw random sets of

289
00:15:31,781 --> 00:15:33,250
complex problems at you.

290
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,260
That's what that's,
that's their definition.

291
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:39,020
So for example,
if you're working as a lawyer on complex

292
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,870
on complex court cases,
you have to be able to read very

293
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:43,880
quickly.
You have to be able to abstract,

294
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:46,280
you have to be able to problem solve,
you have to be able to formulate

295
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:49,670
arguments,
and you have to do that repeatedly in

296
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,310
different ways across very large spans
of time.

297
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:57,380
And so the fact that your ability to
solve any set of random problems is a

298
00:15:57,381 --> 00:16:01,490
really good predictor of your ability to
solve any set of random legal problems.

299
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,160
It's more or less self evident that that
would be the case,

300
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,420
but the but the thing is the thing that
makes Iq so damn powerful and it's one

301
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:10,490
of the personality traits,
roughly speaking,

302
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,880
the thing that makes Iq so powerful is
you can basically get a decent measure

303
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:14,930
of it in 20 minutes.

304
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,990
It's very terrifying.
Anyways,

305
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,700
we'll go into ICU and some depths as we
progress through the course,

306
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,270
but you get one dimension out of out of
factor analysis of Iq.

307
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,200
Now in the personality domain,
we're using descriptive items.

308
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:29,750
You don't.
You get five dimensions and so,

309
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:34,700
so and you and what are these dimensions
exactly while you could think about them

310
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,990
as I think of them as sub personalities,
but here's some other ways of thinking

311
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:40,940
about them because we want to flesh this
out a little bit.

312
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,120
You can think of them as a frame of
reference so that if you're an

313
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:45,560
extrovert,
and I was going to tell you the

314
00:16:45,561 --> 00:16:49,250
extroverted question,
does being around groups of people make

315
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:54,251
you energetic or does it exhaust you and
if you're the sort of person that will

316
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,720
go to a party and interact with 20
people in,

317
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,840
then you have to go home and be by
yourself for like two weeks.

318
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,560
Then you're introverted.
Introverts are exhausted by social

319
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:05,750
interactions.
Extroverts are the opposite.

320
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,853
They all,
they're,

321
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,940
they're,
they're,

322
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,670
they're energized by social interactions
and you know,

323
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:14,390
you might be in the middle so that you
can take it or leave it with regards to

324
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:16,640
social interactions,
but you're happy to go to them and

325
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:19,310
you're happy to spend time by yourself,
but a real extrovert,

326
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:22,940
there'll be some of you in here.
How many of you can't stand spending

327
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:23,774
time alone?

328
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,400
Okay,
so there's only two that will admit it.

329
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,830
Extroverts are more likely to admit that
sort of thing too,

330
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:32,960
by the way.
But then how many of you you like to

331
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:35,090
spend time alone or would rather be
alone?

332
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,490
Okay,
so there is a preponderance of

333
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,190
introverts in this class is by,
by,

334
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,910
by all appearances,
but that's a really,

335
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,540
that's a pretty canonical question for,
for extroversion versus introversion.

336
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:49,530
It's a very stable trait by the way.
It manifests itself early in life and

337
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,550
it's stable across the age span,
not completely.

338
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,110
Introverts can learn to be extroverted.
Extroverts can learn to spend time on

339
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,960
their own.
I think that actually your capacity to

340
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:05,460
expand your ability past the initial
constraints of your biological

341
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:08,670
temperament is something like the
development of character or wisdom you

342
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,400
know,
so if you're an introvert by nature and

343
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:15,120
you learn how to be extroverted,
then that expands your domain of

344
00:18:15,121 --> 00:18:17,430
competence and if you're extroverted and
you learn to be introverted,

345
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,530
the same thing,
but it's almost like imagine a

346
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,960
distribution of extrovert,
introversion here,

347
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:27,110
extroversion here,
a normal distribution you're set when

348
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:27,690
you're young.

349
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,020
It's somewhere along that distribution
with some range around it.

350
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,700
And I think what you do as you mature,
if you develop your skills as you expand

351
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:36,960
that range,
but you're set,

352
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,930
the place at which you're set doesn't
move that much.

353
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,970
So okay,
so there's.

354
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,830
So you can think about them as
subpersonalities.

355
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,560
You can think about them as frames of
reference.

356
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:48,960
So frame of reference would be something
like,

357
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,040
well,
since you're extroverted,

358
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:53,400
you value being with people and so
you're going to look at the world.

359
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,140
For example,
if you're extroverted,

360
00:18:55,141 --> 00:18:56,520
you come into a room like this,
you think,

361
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:58,920
oh look,
it's a whole field of opportunity for

362
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:01,170
social interactions,
and if you're introverted you think,

363
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,140
well maybe I'll go sit up in the corner
and hope everybody leaves me the hell

364
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:05,370
alone,
but so,

365
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:09,810
so it's an a priority set of perceptual
structures that you bring to bear on a

366
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:11,130
whole sequence of,
of,

367
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,000
of,
uh,

368
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,540
environment.

369
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,090
So for example,
maybe you're high in openness versus low

370
00:19:15,091 --> 00:19:17,220
in openness.
That's the creativity dimension.

371
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,210
People are high in openness,
tend to be artists and entrepreneurs and

372
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:26,300
open people will look at other people as
opportunities to engage in interesting

373
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:31,080
intellectual conversations.
And so you can tell when you're talking

374
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:32,580
to someone's old,
someone opened,

375
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:35,110
especially if they're very high in
openness because they're going to want

376
00:19:35,111 --> 00:19:37,980
to talk to you about ideas or about
aesthetics.

377
00:19:37,981 --> 00:19:41,610
That's what it's going to go right away.
So that's how they view you as a source

378
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:44,700
of that sort of conversation.
That's how they view the landscape.

379
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,240
Someone who's high in neuroticism,
which is a negative emotion dimension,

380
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,930
is more likely to view the world as a
place of threats to be,

381
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:56,490
to be protected against because they're
more anxious and more prone to emotional

382
00:19:56,491 --> 00:19:57,600
pain.
Uh,

383
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,770
so anyway,
so,

384
00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:00,520
so that's the frame of reference issue.

385
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,390
So there's,
there's something about your,

386
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,400
under an underlying fundamental
psychological traits that determine or

387
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:09,750
influenced at least your value
structures.

388
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,670
And they,
they do it at the level of perception.

389
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,120
They also tend to set your goals.
So extroverted people have as one goal,

390
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,370
the opportunity to engage with other
people.

391
00:20:20,371 --> 00:20:24,060
So extroverts love parties,
they live for parties,

392
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,810
they love to tell jokes as well.
It's a very good behavioral marker of

393
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,680
extraversion.
And so they,

394
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:33,360
they,
because they value those sorts of

395
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:35,640
things,
they set them as goals in their life or

396
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:39,810
you could say the extroversion operating
within them sets them as goals within

397
00:20:39,811 --> 00:20:42,470
their life,
depending on how deterministic you want

398
00:20:42,471 --> 00:20:43,980
to be about it.
So,

399
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,170
um,
there their patterns of behavior,

400
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,100
that's another,
at a micro level,

401
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,170
you know,
I showed you that sort of hierarchy of,

402
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,390
of,
of,

403
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,610
of value slash frames of references that
ranged from micro-behaviors up to high

404
00:20:57,161 --> 00:21:02,161
order abstractions.
You can extract out a personality from,

405
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,930
by looking at people's micro actions as
well.

406
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:08,230
And one of the papers that I want you
guys to read that's on the course

407
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:12,430
website has to do with our investigation
into behavioral markers of the big five

408
00:21:12,431 --> 00:21:13,264
traits.
Yep.

409
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,500
Maybe I don't,
we don't know exactly.

410
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:23,390
I'll get back to that at the moment.
That's kind of what it looks like is

411
00:21:23,391 --> 00:21:26,110
that introversion is something like the
absence of extroversion.

412
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:29,920
But let me explain extraversion more
particularly and it'll make more sense.

413
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,090
Okay.
All right.

414
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:33,910
So you can think about them as stable
motivation.

415
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:34,870
So pro,
for example,

416
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:38,560
people who hired agreeableness,
I can generally tell people who are high

417
00:21:38,561 --> 00:21:42,310
in agreeableness when they come into my
clinical practice and I start asking

418
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:47,050
them about their biography because my
experience has been that people who are

419
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:51,880
agreeable will tell you their biography
defined by relationships they've had

420
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:54,640
over their life.
So agreeable people are high and

421
00:21:54,641 --> 00:21:57,760
compassion and high end politeness.
It looks like the maternal dimension,

422
00:21:57,761 --> 00:21:59,650
it looks like the pair bonding
dimension,

423
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,110
something like that,
and so agreeable people tend to

424
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:06,220
characterize their lives in terms of the
intimate relationships they've had and

425
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:10,450
so those are also people who would value
an intimate relationship over anything

426
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:10,750
else.

427
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:15,250
If agreeableness is the uppermost trait
that characterizes their personality,

428
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,830
then well systems of values,
we already talked about that a little

429
00:22:20,831 --> 00:22:23,020
bit.
The higher you are at a given trait,

430
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:27,070
the more you value certain opportunities
that are associated with that trait and

431
00:22:27,071 --> 00:22:32,050
so I think it's worthwhile thinking
about traits along using all of those

432
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:36,010
different conceptual schemes to
understand what constitutes a trait,

433
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,000
but
what people are in some sense is a

434
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:42,070
little melody of traits.
Melody,

435
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:43,030
not m,
a l,

436
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:43,750
a d,
y,

437
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,450
although some people are like that,
but melody like a song,

438
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:51,930
you know where were different amounts of
each of the canonical traits operate to

439
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:55,540
a different degree at each person and
the person that manifest themselves as

440
00:22:55,541 --> 00:23:00,250
the is the is the is the panoply of
those traits as they manifest themselves

441
00:23:00,251 --> 00:23:03,520
in the world and so it's actually very
useful to understand your,

442
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,410
your big five traits as far as I'm
concerned.

443
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,300
Actually,
that's why I have you do that exercise

444
00:23:07,301 --> 00:23:09,780
that you're supposed to do for this
class that helps you.

445
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:15,040
You identify your faults and virtues and
I used big five terminology to help you

446
00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:18,640
do that.
So I'm part of the reason it's useful to

447
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:21,580
know what your traits are is because it
can help you figure out how you should

448
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:23,470
orient your life.
So for example,

449
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,010
if you're a hired extroversion,
you know you've.

450
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,600
You've got a proclivity towards sales
for example,

451
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,630
and you're gonna like you're gonna like
occupations where you have a lot of

452
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:34,330
opportunity for social interactions and
social networking.

453
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:39,130
You're not going to be happy if your job
requires you to sit alone by,

454
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:40,030
you know,
for,

455
00:23:40,031 --> 00:23:43,690
for extended periods of time and work in
the absence of social interaction.

456
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:47,030
You're going to be one of those annoying
people then in one of those offices that

457
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,080
instead of sitting alone in their
offices,

458
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,730
going from doorway to doorway,
engaging everyone in conversation,

459
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,300
right?

460
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,110
So and you want to be in a position that
capitalizes on your traits because it's

461
00:23:57,111 --> 00:24:01,010
really difficult to work contrary to
your traits.

462
00:24:01,011 --> 00:24:02,730
The other thing that's worth thinking
about too,

463
00:24:02,731 --> 00:24:06,050
and we're actually building a computer
app for this,

464
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,350
which is about which has been about 80
percent done for a whole year.

465
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,360
We've got a hypothesis that we're still
working out that's supported to some

466
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:17,540
degree by the relevant literature.
So imagine that you're looking for a

467
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,310
stable partner,
right?

468
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,690
So you might think,
well,

469
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,800
what do you want in a stable partner?
And at least in principle,

470
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:29,780
one of the things you don't want is too
much mismatch between you and that

471
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:32,780
person on the five fundamental dementia.
So for example,

472
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,890
if you're really extroverted and you
have a really introverted partner,

473
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:42,110
you're going to engage in continual
conflict about how much social activity

474
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,600
the two of you should,
should be,

475
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,810
should,
should what subject yourself to.

476
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,780
And it's very,
very difficult for people who broadly

477
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:55,781
differ widely differ on those dimensions
to come to consensus because it's not

478
00:24:55,881 --> 00:24:57,500
just a matter of opinion,
right?

479
00:24:57,501 --> 00:25:01,670
It's really a matter of different.
If you're looking at extremes of really

480
00:25:01,671 --> 00:25:04,670
different types of people,
and the thing about introverts is they

481
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:08,450
just don't enjoy large scale social
interaction.

482
00:25:08,451 --> 00:25:10,340
That much one on one,
they're often fine,

483
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:12,130
but in a group they don't like that and
they.

484
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,630
It tires them out.
Whereas a real extrovert,

485
00:25:14,631 --> 00:25:18,770
it's like you isolate them and and they
just wither on the vine because a huge

486
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:23,150
part of what actually motivates them in
a positive way is tangled up with social

487
00:25:23,151 --> 00:25:27,080
interaction.
And so if you're an agreeable person and

488
00:25:27,081 --> 00:25:29,240
you have a particularly disagreeable
partner,

489
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:32,780
you're also going to run into problems
because the agreeable person will say

490
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,670
whatever you want,
whenever and the agreeable per a

491
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,670
disagreeable person will say,
well,

492
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:41,750
I'd like to know what the hell you want
for a change and be much more harsh and

493
00:25:41,751 --> 00:25:45,530
much more demanding in this situation,
and the agreeable person is going to

494
00:25:45,531 --> 00:25:48,320
find the disagreeable person harsh and
unpleasant,

495
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,910
and the disagreeable person is going to
find the agreeable person wishy washy

496
00:25:52,911 --> 00:25:54,800
and unable to stand up for themselves.

497
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,633
And again,
that's a,

498
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:59,120
that's actually one of the primary
sources of tension between men and women

499
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,090
because women tend to be higher in
agreeableness than men.

500
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,430
It's about half a standard deviation,
which is quite,

501
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:05,120
quite,
uh,

502
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,760
quite a,
quite a large difference by

503
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:12,950
psychological standards.
And so what that means,

504
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,530
I probably haven't got this statistic
quite right,

505
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,220
but I think I've got it about right.
What that means fundamentally,

506
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:23,630
just so you have some sense of how large
a fact that is,

507
00:26:23,631 --> 00:26:27,470
is that if you have a group of men and
women and you pick out random pairs,

508
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,340
the woman is going to be more agreeable
than the man 60 percent of the time,

509
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,740
so that's not an overwhelming
proportion,

510
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,220
but it's reliable and it's quite.
It's quite large by psychological

511
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,770
standards,
so there's the problem with

512
00:26:39,771 --> 00:26:42,680
agreeableness with conscientiousness.
Well,

513
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:47,360
if you're conscientious,
you're industrious and orderly and

514
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,210
orderly.

515
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,130
People seem to be sensitive to
discussed,

516
00:26:50,131 --> 00:26:52,110
which is something we'll talk about in
detail later.

517
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:56,970
We've had a hard time specifying exactly
what makes industrious people

518
00:26:56,971 --> 00:27:00,000
industrious because it's hard to come up
with an animal model for that sort of

519
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:05,001
thing and there's no theoretical model,
but our latest idea is that it's not my

520
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:07,530
idea.
It's actually the idea of my graduate

521
00:27:07,531 --> 00:27:08,730
student,
Christine Brophy,

522
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:12,360
is that industrious.
People find it

523
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,750
unpleasant and unsettling to to not be
doing something so it isn't so much that

524
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,410
industriousness makes them happy or
fills them with positive emotion.

525
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,060
That would be more extroversion,
right?

526
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:26,160
Because extroversion is the positive
emotion dimension.

527
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,060
It's an industrious.
People can't stand sitting around doing

528
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:33,810
nothing and you know,
this is speculation,

529
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:38,430
but human beings are obviously always
engaged in the exchange of labor,

530
00:27:38,431 --> 00:27:40,740
especially the reciprocal exchange of
labor.

531
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:45,741
And you can imagine that in a in a
community where everyone knows everyone,

532
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:49,350
the people who work hard are going to be
pretty irritated on a fairly chronic

533
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:52,020
basis with the people who are completely
unproductive.

534
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,760
And my suspicions are that plenty of
people who were completely unproductive

535
00:27:56,761 --> 00:27:58,410
in the history of,
of our,

536
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,370
of the evolution of our species were
wiped out by people who were unhappy

537
00:28:02,371 --> 00:28:06,930
with their lack of productivity.
And so I think generally speaking,

538
00:28:06,931 --> 00:28:10,980
human beings have this sense of ethical
obligation with regards to one another

539
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,120
to share labor.
And people who are conscientious really,

540
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:19,560
really feel that so they feel bad if
they're not busily working on something

541
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,760
that's productive all the time.
And so the advantage to being with

542
00:28:23,761 --> 00:28:25,080
someone conscientious is,
well,

543
00:28:25,081 --> 00:28:27,290
they're going to work like mad.
But the disadvantages,

544
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:30,150
they're going to work like mad.
So you know,

545
00:28:30,151 --> 00:28:33,560
if you're looking for a partner that you
want to relax with or have fun with or

546
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,420
who isn't uptight,
then a conscientious person is probably

547
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:38,790
not a very good choice.
On the other hand,

548
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,150
if you're a conscientious person and
you're living with someone who's really

549
00:28:42,151 --> 00:28:44,790
unconscientious,
that's good because they might be able

550
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:46,860
to help you relax,
but you're not going to be happy with

551
00:28:46,861 --> 00:28:48,720
them because they don't work nearly as
hard as you do.

552
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,780
But even worse on the orderly dimension,
you know,

553
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,860
some of you have had roommates and maybe
you're more orderly than your roommate.

554
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,750
What does it mean?
It means you're annoyed by mess before

555
00:29:00,751 --> 00:29:05,100
they are and you don't have to be
annoyed by mess much before you're less

556
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:08,430
orderly roommate for you to be the one
that's always running around picking

557
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:11,520
things up.
And so actually one of the things that's

558
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:15,360
emerged from the psychometric analysis
is that women are slightly more orderly

559
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:18,120
than men.
And I suspect that has something to do

560
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:20,010
with Un.
What would you call it?

561
00:29:20,011 --> 00:29:24,860
Inequitable distribution of housework.
Because even if you're imagine that your

562
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:29,100
proclivity is to be triggered by
disorder 25 seconds before your

563
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,500
partners,
well you're going to end up.

564
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:34,710
It doesn't take much difference for you
to be the one that's always concerned

565
00:29:34,711 --> 00:29:37,410
about the mess first.
So anyways.

566
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,680
And so if you're a really orderly person
and you live with a disorderly person,

567
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,450
well good luck getting along with them.
They're going to regard you as like

568
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:49,420
uptight and,
and over concerned with details and,

569
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,840
and,
and well and unwilling to relax.

570
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:55,840
That's for sure.
And they're are going to regard you as

571
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,520
well.
Just a bloody mess.

572
00:29:57,521 --> 00:30:00,070
And how can anyone possibly live with
someone like you.

573
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,610
And so,
so another reason why it's useful to

574
00:30:03,611 --> 00:30:07,930
understand your personality is because I
think it gives you a better crack at

575
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:11,530
finding someone that you can actually
live with over the long run.

576
00:30:11,531 --> 00:30:14,650
And we don't know what the optimal.
I don't think you want to live with

577
00:30:14,651 --> 00:30:18,760
someone who is exactly like you because
then both of you have the same strengths

578
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:20,950
and weaknesses and there's a bit of a
problem there,

579
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:23,860
right?
Because maybe an agreeable person can

580
00:30:23,861 --> 00:30:27,580
use a bit of disagreeable person around
them to balance each other out and vice

581
00:30:27,581 --> 00:30:28,414
versa.
Right?

582
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,830
So we don't understand the optimal
balance for,

583
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,260
for,
for longterm thriving in a relationship.

584
00:30:35,261 --> 00:30:39,520
But I think we do understand the fact
that if you're too different in your

585
00:30:39,521 --> 00:30:42,070
traits,
that those where you're different is

586
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:45,520
going to constitute a chronic source of
conflict.

587
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,960
So,
so anyways,

588
00:30:47,961 --> 00:30:49,450
so you can think about that.
So.

589
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,820
Alright.
So how have psychologists studied

590
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:55,690
personality?
Well,

591
00:30:55,691 --> 00:30:58,870
I'm going to talk most about the
statistical psychometric approach to

592
00:30:58,871 --> 00:31:01,360
begin with,
but there are other approaches that we

593
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:03,280
will talk about as well.
So,

594
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,880
um,
let me give you some let,

595
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:08,980
let me give you the background on the
self report.

596
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,790
Um,
methodology first because it's really

597
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:16,380
formed the back bone of,
of psychological research into

598
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:21,390
personality.
So imagine that you took a comprehensive

599
00:31:22,061 --> 00:31:26,110
sample of all the descriptive adjectives
in the English language.

600
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,080
Now,
it's trickier than you think because

601
00:31:29,081 --> 00:31:32,770
actually what constitutes an adjective
isn't that easy to determine because

602
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:35,020
many words have forms that are
adjective,

603
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:36,400
verb,
and Noun,

604
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:39,220
depending on how their.
How the same word is written out,

605
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:43,150
so distinguishing adjectives from verbs
or adverbs turns out to be more

606
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,030
difficult than you might think,
but let's just say for the sake of

607
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:49,720
argument that you could collect all of
the descriptive adjectives in the

608
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:53,950
English language and that then perhaps
you decided because you don't want to

609
00:31:53,951 --> 00:31:56,470
use all of them,
you decided that you were going to use

610
00:31:56,471 --> 00:32:01,310
the most common thousand of them and
there are tables that enable,

611
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,510
enable you to look up the frequency of
words.

612
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,120
And it turns out that in common
parlance,

613
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:12,670
it's like five percent of the vocabulary
of English language accounts for 95

614
00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:15,460
percent of the usage.
It's an example of this phenomena called

615
00:32:15,461 --> 00:32:17,650
the burrito distribution,
which we'll talk about later.

616
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:22,330
So in fact,
most discourse has done with 500 words.

617
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:27,360
You can get about 80 percent.
Something like that of speech in terms

618
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:29,950
of single word comprehension with 500
words.

619
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:34,240
So let's say you took the thousand,
you took all the descriptive adjectives

620
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,940
and then you took the ones that were the
most common thousand.

621
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,740
And so here's the hypothesis,
hypothesis part,

622
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,990
and this is a critical thing to know.
This is called the linguistic

623
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:48,890
hypothesis.
The linguistic hypothesis is that

624
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:54,820
variation in personality among human
beings is of sufficient import so that

625
00:32:56,211 --> 00:32:59,660
it's become accurately coded in the
lexicon.

626
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,100
So what that means is that roughly
speaking,

627
00:33:04,101 --> 00:33:07,550
is that over the course of the evolution
or evolution of any language,

628
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:12,551
we use English as the example here,
descriptive terms have been generated

629
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:18,040
that actually do cover the variation in
personality and that essentially cover

630
00:33:18,411 --> 00:33:20,030
them without bias.

631
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,720
Now that's a hypothesis.
Actually.

632
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:26,810
It's an axiom.
It's because the hypothesis is in some

633
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:28,910
sense isn't.
It's not exactly testable.

634
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:32,630
We'll leave that aside for now.
It's testable a little bit,

635
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:33,770
but not,
not easily.

636
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,600
So.
So that's the first thing you have to

637
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:38,030
accept.
You have to accept that it's possible to

638
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:41,840
extract out what constitutes personality
by looking at the linguistic

639
00:33:41,841 --> 00:33:46,790
representation of descriptors in so far
as they're encapsulated in language.

640
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,560
Okay?
So when,

641
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,300
when people talk about trait models,
like the big five being comprehensive

642
00:33:53,301 --> 00:33:58,010
representations of personality,
that that isn't exactly what they mean

643
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:02,360
and you need to know this,
what they mean is that it's a

644
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:06,680
comprehensive representation of
personality in so far as personality has

645
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:10,430
been encapsulated in language.
There may be elements of personality

646
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:13,310
that we haven't been able to talk about
or we don't know how to talk about that

647
00:34:13,311 --> 00:34:16,880
are of crucial importance and there may
not be,

648
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:19,970
but the big five theorists assume that
there aren't.

649
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,003
All right?
So,

650
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:22,940
so that's,
that's,

651
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,480
that's a limitation of the theory.
But if you accept that,

652
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,591
then you say,
well,

653
00:34:27,591 --> 00:34:31,760
the first thing you want to do is take a
relatively random cross section of the

654
00:34:31,761 --> 00:34:36,761
descriptive terms because then you don't
introduce bias into the initial stages

655
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:38,760
of the inquiry.
So Matt,

656
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,810
I'll tell you something that we did
recently and you can tell me what you

657
00:34:41,811 --> 00:34:44,450
think about its analogous.
We're trying to study political

658
00:34:44,451 --> 00:34:47,180
correctness.
And so what the first thing we're trying

659
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:49,340
to figure out was,
is there even such a thing?

660
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,850
Because if you,
if you look at the political dialogue,

661
00:34:52,851 --> 00:34:56,990
what you find is that people on the side
of the political spectrum who have been

662
00:34:56,991 --> 00:35:00,420
defined as politically correct tend to
say that it doesn't exist and that

663
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:03,950
category is just a pejorative term that
was invented by people who hold

664
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,080
alternative political opinions.

665
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,970
And so the first question is,
well,

666
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:12,740
what do you mean some does it exist?
What do you mean by exist?

667
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,110
What?
How do you tell if a psychological

668
00:35:15,111 --> 00:35:19,250
concept is real?
Like his anger is anger or something

669
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:23,120
that exists objectively.
Is it done an objective phenomena?

670
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,010
Well,
it's not that easy to,

671
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,240
to determine.
You say,

672
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:29,690
well we,
we act like it is and we understand what

673
00:35:29,691 --> 00:35:34,640
anger means if but no one goes around in
the world and says anger without saying

674
00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:36,350
anything else or you'd run away from
them.

675
00:35:36,351 --> 00:35:38,600
You know what they do is they,
they,

676
00:35:38,601 --> 00:35:43,230
they placed the word anger into a
sentence and place the sentence within a

677
00:35:43,231 --> 00:35:47,550
conversation and they enable you to
infer exactly what they mean by the word

678
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:50,160
anger,
by listening to the surrounding context.

679
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:52,650
Right?
And if you're going to turn that into

680
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,740
something like an objective term,
what you do is you pull out the term

681
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,790
anger and then you make the hypothesis
that it represents something real in the

682
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:00,810
objective world.

683
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,200
But it's not that easy to determine if
something does exist,

684
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,680
especially if it's a psychological
phenomena in the real world.

685
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:11,520
What do you mean by exist?
That's the problem of construct

686
00:36:11,521 --> 00:36:12,660
validation.
Okay,

687
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,270
so that's another term you really need
to know if you're interested in

688
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:18,300
experimental psychology,
especially on the personality and a

689
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:23,301
construct is a representation of
something psychological that

690
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:25,860
hypothetically exists.
Objectively,

691
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,350
how do you establish its existence
objectively?

692
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:30,210
Well,
does fear exist?

693
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,930
Now you have the problem with all the
emotional terms.

694
00:36:33,931 --> 00:36:37,650
Does joy exist to surprise exist?
Does embarrassment exists?

695
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,300
Does guilt exist?
Shame?

696
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,550
How are they related to one of their
guilt and shame,

697
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:43,650
for example,
seem quite similar to one another.

698
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,890
Right?
And pain and fear and anger all seem to

699
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:48,110
share the,
the,

700
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:51,180
the,
the attribute of unpleasant and negative

701
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:53,370
emotions.
And so how similar,

702
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,680
how something.
If something exists,

703
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:58,560
it should be the same as some things and
different from other things,

704
00:36:58,561 --> 00:37:03,150
and that's part of construct validation
as well to specify how the construct is

705
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:05,700
the same as some things and different
from others.

706
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,880
Anger should be reliably distinguishable
from joy,

707
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,370
for example,
because otherwise they're not different

708
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:15,300
and anger and fear should be somewhat
the same if they're both negative

709
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:18,860
emotions.
So it's extraordinarily complex to to,

710
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,530
to validate a construct.
And so here,

711
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,180
here's what we did with political
correctness and it's.

712
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,710
The reason I'm using the political
examples is because that's an obvious

713
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:33,480
place where self serving bias can enter
the scientific arena.

714
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:37,710
Right?
So if I wanted to make a point about

715
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:41,070
political correctness or if I wanted to
make a point about rightwing fascism,

716
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:45,390
I could build my biases into the
measurement instruments accidentally and

717
00:37:45,391 --> 00:37:48,660
then they would produce as output,
what I put into them as input.

718
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,810
And I want to protect myself against
that if I actually want to do this

719
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:56,460
scientific investigation properly.
So what we did when we started to

720
00:37:56,461 --> 00:38:00,660
construct our measures of political
correctness was getting employee a

721
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:05,340
number of people to go through as many
news sources as they could get their

722
00:38:05,341 --> 00:38:09,690
hands on to identify any attitude or
behavior,

723
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,590
some roughly that that had been
described by anyone at all as

724
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,330
potentially politically correct.

725
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,200
So it was kind of agnostic and we're
trying to do it as randomly as possible,

726
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:20,970
you know,
to get as many new sources as we

727
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:25,971
possibly could so that we were sampling
across the environment without bias.

728
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,140
Okay.
So then we came up with,

729
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:30,290
I don't remember how many,
couple hundred,

730
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,950
maybe more a couple hundred items that
were roughly indicative of what you

731
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,750
might describe as political correctness,
but that's not good enough,

732
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:39,430
right?
Because just because you have this

733
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:43,510
random assemblage of items doesn't
indicate at all that they're all

734
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:47,620
measuring something that was similar,
but that's just implicit.

735
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:48,970
They're all called political
correctness,

736
00:38:48,971 --> 00:38:51,760
but you don't know if those attitudes
covariant.

737
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:55,480
What that means is if you held one
attitude of that list,

738
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:59,200
were you more likely to hold another or
multiple others?

739
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,350
Right.
So is the conditional probability of

740
00:39:02,351 --> 00:39:07,210
holding multiple items.
Is there a high probability of holding

741
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,560
true multiple items simultaneously while
you figure that out with factor

742
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:12,040
analysis?

743
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,700
So what we did is we turned that into a
questionnaire using different question

744
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:19,840
types and we administered it to several
hundred people and we did a factor

745
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:22,930
analysis and we found actually that
there was such a thing as political

746
00:39:22,931 --> 00:39:25,960
correctness because the questions
clumped together,

747
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,900
people would reliably answered them in a
pattern manner,

748
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,660
but that there were actually two
dimensions that were quite separate.

749
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,970
So there isn't one political
correctness,

750
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:37,360
there seems to be two.
And then we looked at the personality

751
00:39:37,361 --> 00:39:41,230
predictors in the ICU predictors in a
variety of other predictors that would

752
00:39:41,231 --> 00:39:46,231
enable us to come to some understanding
of the temperamental proclivity towards

753
00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:48,880
those political attitudes,
if any.

754
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:54,090
We knew already that
political conservatives tended to be low

755
00:39:54,221 --> 00:39:58,090
in trait openness.
That's the creativity dimension and high

756
00:39:58,091 --> 00:40:01,870
in trait conscientiousness.
Whereas political liberals tended to be

757
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:04,960
high in trait,
openness and low in conscientiousness.

758
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:09,130
And so one of the things that's
extraordinarily interesting to know from

759
00:40:09,131 --> 00:40:13,360
the big five perspective is that your
political proclivities are very

760
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:15,340
powerfully influenced by your
temperament.

761
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:19,120
And so one of the things you can think
about with regards to ongoing political

762
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:23,230
discussions in the real world is that
those discussions are actually attempts

763
00:40:23,231 --> 00:40:26,320
by people of different temperament.
One,

764
00:40:26,321 --> 00:40:31,321
to impose their temperamental viewpoints
on the world and to to engage in a

765
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:34,720
dialogue with people who are actually
quite different than they are.

766
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:39,550
So like conscientious people like they,
they value hard work,

767
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,170
rules,
order

768
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,060
reliability,
integrity and structure.

769
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,050
And so their dutiful.
We analyze what predicted military

770
00:40:50,051 --> 00:40:51,130
performance.
For example,

771
00:40:51,131 --> 00:40:54,100
in theU ,
s army overwhelmingly conscientiousness.

772
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:55,540
It's not surprising,
right?

773
00:40:55,541 --> 00:41:00,430
Because it's a very structured rule,
ordered top down,

774
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:05,750
a follow procedure sort of endeavor.
Now the armed forces had problems with

775
00:41:06,641 --> 00:41:09,970
that to some degree because they were
also simultaneously looking for people

776
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,460
who could think independently on their
feet.

777
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,770
Because if you're in a battlefield,
for example,

778
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,170
especially if you're isolated from your
command structure,

779
00:41:17,171 --> 00:41:20,530
there's gonna be times when you have to
make extraordinarily difficult decisions

780
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:24,220
on your own.
But if you're selected primarily for

781
00:41:24,221 --> 00:41:26,740
conscientiousness,
that's not going to be your forte

782
00:41:26,741 --> 00:41:28,480
because if you're a conscientious
person,

783
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,870
what happens is that you enter into a
contract with someone,

784
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,340
even yourself,
and then you carry it out.

785
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:38,450
So now we've also spent a lot of time
selecting entrepreneurs.

786
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:43,470
I work with this company in California
that has started schools for

787
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:48,140
entrepreneurs in 100 and now I think 160
different countries all over the world.

788
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:51,130
This the guy who started this,
whose name is Dale Resi,

789
00:41:51,131 --> 00:41:53,000
he's a real.
He's an absolute monster.

790
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:54,590
The guy started,
well,

791
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,920
he started all those schools in five
years,

792
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:01,400
165 schools in all,
all across the world,

793
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,060
eight different languages and we've been
screening people for entrepreneurial

794
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:07,190
ability and if you're going to be an
entrepreneur,

795
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:09,230
you almost have the opposite profile.

796
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:12,470
As a soldier.
You're very high in openness and you're

797
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:15,980
lowering conscientiousness or at least
conscientiousness is irrelevant.

798
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:19,850
And the reason for that seems to be that
like if you're an orderly person and

799
00:42:19,851 --> 00:42:21,950
you'd like to follow procedures and
rules,

800
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,580
it's kind of hard for you to start a
company because when you first start a

801
00:42:25,581 --> 00:42:27,860
company or engage in any other creative
process,

802
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,380
because entrepreneurs turn out to be the
same as artists,

803
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:34,400
you kind of have to.
You're not operating within a rural

804
00:42:34,401 --> 00:42:35,720
governance structure.
In fact,

805
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:40,721
there may be many times where you have
to break a small rule to to move

806
00:42:41,421 --> 00:42:45,800
properly at a higher level of analysis.
There's no algorithmic way of generating

807
00:42:45,801 --> 00:42:46,940
a new company,
right?

808
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,940
Obviously.
And so it's people who are very high in

809
00:42:49,941 --> 00:42:52,430
openness,
who happened to be good entrepreneurs.

810
00:42:52,431 --> 00:42:56,620
And so this is something I thought was
extraordinarily cool because we'd.

811
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,330
We'd also already known what predicts
managerial,

812
00:42:59,331 --> 00:43:04,331
administrative and academic ability and
Iq is crucial for any complex jobs.

813
00:43:04,701 --> 00:43:07,880
So we'll just leave that behind.
But what predicts academic ability,

814
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:12,020
for example at the University of Toronto
is in intelligence obviously,

815
00:43:12,021 --> 00:43:15,530
but also conscientiousness.
The correlation between creativity and

816
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:18,980
grades at the UFT is zero.
Zero.

817
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,690
Right?
But it's not.

818
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,030
It's not surprising that the thing is
that you know,

819
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:25,940
it's easy to be cynical about that,
but one of the things you have to

820
00:43:25,941 --> 00:43:30,560
understand about creative people is that
they continually step outside of the

821
00:43:30,561 --> 00:43:33,110
domain of evaluation structures,
right?

822
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:37,700
Because if you're going to say you're
going to evaluate the performance of 100

823
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:41,360
professors on their lecturing ability,
while you kind of have to measure what's

824
00:43:41,361 --> 00:43:45,590
common across all the professors in
order to come up with the standards for

825
00:43:45,591 --> 00:43:48,320
evaluation,
well that means you're not going to be

826
00:43:48,321 --> 00:43:52,460
able to use that structure to evaluate a
particularly creative professor because

827
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:56,570
he or she is going to do something in a
way that's so different that it won't

828
00:43:56,571 --> 00:43:59,990
show up on the evaluation measure and
that of course that's what happens in

829
00:43:59,991 --> 00:44:00,650
universities.

830
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:04,400
You know,
somebody sent me a couple of days ago,

831
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:08,150
somebody sent me an essay that they had
written for their master's thesis that

832
00:44:08,151 --> 00:44:12,650
was wildly creative and they were
basically told to leave the program and

833
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,720
that they couldn't continue.
Not in a mean way.

834
00:44:14,721 --> 00:44:16,820
They.
What happened was that what they were

835
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:20,930
thinking was so outside of the
conventions in the discipline is that no

836
00:44:20,931 --> 00:44:22,880
one had any idea what to do with the
essay,

837
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:26,030
so then that's really the law of
creative people,

838
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:27,800
right?
They're always stepping outside of

839
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:31,740
evaluation structures and so it's not
that surprising that relationship

840
00:44:31,741 --> 00:44:35,220
between creativity and grades at the u
of t is zero.

841
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,940
We found out as well by looking at
graduate student performance across

842
00:44:38,941 --> 00:44:43,200
multiple institutions that there was a
negative correlation between creativity

843
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:46,200
and graduate school performance.
It wasn't even zero.

844
00:44:46,201 --> 00:44:50,550
It was worse than negative.
Being creative was negative and you

845
00:44:50,551 --> 00:44:52,170
think,
well that could make you cynical as

846
00:44:52,171 --> 00:44:52,790
well,
but.

847
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:57,790
But you can't be cynical in that way
because one of the things that happens

848
00:44:58,021 --> 00:45:03,021
in science is that science tends to
progress incrementally rather than in

849
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:07,110
great leaps now and then someone comes
along who blows the structure out of a

850
00:45:07,111 --> 00:45:10,170
science advances at a ridiculously like
Einstein,

851
00:45:10,171 --> 00:45:13,530
but like most people are nine style.
It may be thank God for that.

852
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:16,770
Most of the time you're in a discipline,
you,

853
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:20,340
you understand the discipline,
and then once you've developed

854
00:45:20,341 --> 00:45:24,480
understanding of the discipline,
you know what the next micro question is

855
00:45:24,481 --> 00:45:28,500
that should be answered and part of the
reason that science is so powerful is

856
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:32,850
because it allows people who aren't
genius level creatives to make real

857
00:45:32,851 --> 00:45:37,200
advances in the generation of knowledge.
One tiny micro step at a time,

858
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:42,030
doesn't matter if there's 100,000 people
doing it and each of them is making a

859
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:42,930
micro step.
Man,

860
00:45:42,931 --> 00:45:45,780
we're zipping along as fast as we
possibly wanted zip along,

861
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,060
and so it turns out to be
conscientiousness.

862
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,490
That's the excellent predictor of
graduate student performance.

863
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:54,270
That's the best predictor for law.
It's the best predictor for managerial

864
00:45:54,271 --> 00:45:55,800
positions.
It's the best predictor for

865
00:45:55,801 --> 00:45:59,400
administrative positions.
Anything that has a structure of rules

866
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:03,360
that needs to be applied.
Conscientiousness is a great predictor,

867
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:07,140
so but it's not good for predicting
artistic ability or entrepreneurial

868
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:10,050
ability and that's also really important
because one of the things.

869
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:13,650
This is partly why bureaucracies
stultify right?

870
00:46:13,651 --> 00:46:15,630
Because what happens is they,
as they develop,

871
00:46:15,631 --> 00:46:19,290
they get chock full of conscientious
people with a few psychopaths thrown in

872
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:23,040
there just for good measure.
They get chocked full of conscientious

873
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:26,910
people busily zooming,
efficiently down to a single track,

874
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,630
and then all of a sudden the landscape
shifts and they're going very,

875
00:46:30,631 --> 00:46:34,230
very efficiently in exactly the wrong
direction and then the whole bloody

876
00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:37,740
thing falls apart.
So you need to have some creative wing

877
00:46:37,741 --> 00:46:42,741
knots in your organization to come up
with completely absurd ideas that might

878
00:46:42,811 --> 00:46:44,700
just on the off chance be true.

879
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:47,850
And so creativity is strange in that
manner too.

880
00:46:47,851 --> 00:46:50,400
Because it's a high risk,
high return game.

881
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:55,580
You're a lot safer in your life to find
a functioning entity and to operate as a

882
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:58,710
cog within it,
as long as the entity keeps functioning.

883
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:03,090
Because if you're creative and you go
off on tangents all the time,

884
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,050
there's some probability that one of
those tangents is going to be exactly

885
00:47:07,051 --> 00:47:10,170
what is needed at the time and you're
going to become hyper successful as a

886
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:12,750
consequence.
But there's much more probability that

887
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,810
even though your.
Some of your ideas might be highly

888
00:47:15,811 --> 00:47:18,600
valuable,
the probability that this is the right

889
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:21,780
time and place for them is
extraordinarily low,

890
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:24,420
so to produce a successful creative
product,

891
00:47:24,421 --> 00:47:25,830
for example,
in the marketplace,

892
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:30,880
you need a ridiculous combination of
creativity so that you keep generating

893
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:35,881
ideas and then a network around you of
people who have skills that you don't

894
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,820
and then the production of a of a
product,

895
00:47:39,821 --> 00:47:43,270
let's say whatever that happens to be,
that's actually in demand by the

896
00:47:43,271 --> 00:47:48,040
marketplace at exactly that moment and
that someone else hasn't already done

897
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:48,874
better.

898
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:53,910
So the sensible thing to tell anybody
who wants to be creative is that stupid.

899
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:55,880
You shouldn't do it.
It's,

900
00:47:55,881 --> 00:48:00,790
it's your probability of success is so
low that it's better just to do

901
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:03,340
something sensible.
But the problem with that is that

902
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:07,270
creative people can't do that because
they're creative and if they shut down

903
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:09,820
their creativity,
it's like an extrovert who's gone to

904
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:12,280
live in a,
in an isolated cell,

905
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,560
a creative person who isn't being
creative,

906
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,960
they just,
they just wither and die.

907
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,730
So they're stuck with it.
So.

908
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:21,670
But it is a high risk,
high return strategy.

909
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:26,290
So probably better if you want to be
creative or if you are and you should

910
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:29,260
take this advice to heart because I'd
been watching people for a long time.

911
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,840
If you want to engage in a creative
pursuit,

912
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:37,500
you should find something stable to do
that will generate you an income and you

913
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:40,930
should pursue the thing that you're
creative about on the side because

914
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:45,880
monetizing creative production is so
bloody difficult that especially now

915
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,100
like especially in like artistic
domains,

916
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,960
generation of music and that sort of
thing.

917
00:48:49,961 --> 00:48:54,961
It's like you just have no idea how many
million songs there are on the Internet

918
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,740
and the vast majority of them
commercially available get downloaded

919
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,060
zero times,
like 80 per,

920
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,410
I think there's 80 million songs or
something like that on the net and I

921
00:49:05,411 --> 00:49:08,590
believe it's something in the
neighborhood of 70 million get

922
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:13,591
downloaded zero times and then there's
100 that can get downloaded like $350

923
00:49:14,131 --> 00:49:16,600
million times.
And so those people are wildly

924
00:49:16,601 --> 00:49:19,420
successful and everyone else collapses
in failure.

925
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:20,343
Yep.

926
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:25,060
No,
we'll talk about that more.

927
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:27,160
Okay.
So that's not a bad overview for,

928
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:30,310
for initial foray into psychometrics.
