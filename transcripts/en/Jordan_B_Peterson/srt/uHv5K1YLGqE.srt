00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,670
Hi Guys.
So a quick update.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:06,520
Okay,

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,353
now I'm going to be having a debate 
Saturday at nine 30 in the morning 

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,183
eastern standard time and it will be 
live cast on Jordan Peterson videos on 

5
00:00:15,881 --> 00:00:19,090
youtube.
The participants will be Mayo Moran,

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,150
who's the moderator,
she's a professor of law and the provost

7
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:24,130
at Trinity College,
University of Toronto.

8
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:25,743
I'll be debating Mary Bryson,
who's a professor of education and 

9
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:29,554
senior Associate Dean Administration and
innovation at the University of British 

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,350
Columbia.
And Brenda Cossman,

11
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:36,184
who is professor of law and director of 
the bottom center for sexual diversity 

12
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:40,924
studies at the University of Toronto.
She'll undoubtedly telling me that I 

13
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,124
don't really understand bill [inaudible]
and the legislation that I'm commenting 

14
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:50,530
on,
but we'll see about that.

15
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,690
So of course,
since the debate has been announced,

16
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:58,990
the PC authoritarians are in an uproar 
because,

17
00:00:58,991 --> 00:00:59,824
um,
well as Huffington Post Canada blogger 

18
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,723
idle Khatri pointed out,
the university met my demands for 

19
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:09,610
holding a public debate.
Well,

20
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,580
I want to just mention a few things 
about that because he,

21
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,443
first of all,
he doesn't know what the hell he's 

22
00:01:13,931 --> 00:01:15,040
talking about.
And so,

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,990
well,
let's just say that he's uninformed.

24
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,210
I didn't demand that the university 
holds a debate.

25
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,223
I met with the Dean after receiving two 
letters from the university warning me 

26
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:24,244
to stop doing what I was doing and I 
suggested given the uproar that 

27
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:28,204
surrounded the videos,
that there was something that should be 

28
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:32,464
talked out in that the university could 
perhaps models civilized conversation 

29
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:36,514
about such complex topics.
And so I was in no position to demand 

30
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:43,090
anything.
So it's typical of of I would say the PC

31
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:46,480
authoritarian ideology or idealogue 
misuse of language.

32
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,523
You can bend the story too to suit your 
perspective without really giving any 

33
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,073
second thought to the truth.
And of course he commented the 

34
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,123
University of Toronto is providing yet 
another stage for spreading uninformed 

35
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:00,994
fear and hate.
Well you can make what you want out of 

36
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:04,144
that.
I don't know what exactly he means by 

37
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:06,064
yet another stage.
I mean they certainly didn't provide me 

38
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:08,914
with my first stage and of course I 
wasn't spreading uninformed fear and 

39
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:12,004
hate to begin with.
But I would say that's just typical of 

40
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:15,934
of the behavior of,
of the people on the PC authoritarian 

41
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:23,440
part of the political spectrum.
So what else is new?

42
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,780
Well,
Leonard Cohen died,

43
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:28,270
so that really was too bad because he 
was great.

44
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,193
That's the big news in Canada.
And then of course Donald Trump was 

45
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:04,610
elected this week.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

46
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,800
Complicated business.

47
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,143
Copper

48
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,570
can.
Why was that?

49
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,160
Well,
there were a variety of reasons,

50
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:12,994
of course,
but I think that the simplest 

51
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:17,760
explanation was that in in the mid 
seventies the Democrats,

52
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:20,320
they abandoned the working class to play
identity politics.

53
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:22,450
And that's too bad because of the 
working class.

54
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:23,284
Reagan needs a voice in politics.
And part of the reason for that is that 

55
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,120
there is a proclivity in societies for,
for the winter to take all fundamentally

56
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:35,710
in in monetary circumstances.
And so that accounts for the rise,

57
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:36,544
not so much of the 1% but if the one 
10th of one 10th of 1% and it is a 

58
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:41,884
constant societal battle to ensure that 
economic resources are funneled in some 

59
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:49,570
manner down to the people who were near 
the bottom of the dominance hierarchy.

60
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,703
So the working class needs a voice,
but it's not the Democrats and that's 

61
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:58,360
why the rust belt abandoned them and 
cost Hillary Clinton the election.

62
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,993
They identity politics.
People are not interested in the 

63
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:03,754
individual.
This is sort of their defining 

64
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,770
characteristic.
And for them,

65
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,950
group membership is all that counts.
I was thinking today,

66
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:09,784
if you told the Kentucky Coal Miner this
story about people demanding their own 

67
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,860
pronouns,
the first thing he'd think is,

68
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,240
man,
I'm voting trump.

69
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,660
And you know,
it's,

70
00:04:17,661 --> 00:04:19,840
it's hardly surprising.
So anyhow,

71
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:24,430
that's what happened in the u s so back 
to the,

72
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,840
to the topic at hand,
I want to review with a pc game again,

73
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,570
and this is,
this is the game that the Democrats have

74
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,070
been playing,
especially on the left.

75
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,173
Instead of focusing as they should be 
focusing on the economic concerns of 

76
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:40,840
people who are disadvantaged regardless 
of their group identity.

77
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,093
To play the VC game,
you identify an area of human activity 

78
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,730
that can be any area of human activity 
from sports to economic activity.

79
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,013
You know that there's a distribution of 
success in that area of activity like 

80
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:53,524
there is in every human activity.
There's some people who are good at 

81
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,523
whatever it is that's being done in some
people who were less good and of course 

82
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:00,064
the people who are good at it do better 
in the people who are not as good do 

83
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:03,094
worse,
so you identify the winners and the 

84
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:05,824
losers.
Then you claimed that the losers are 

85
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,700
losing because they're oppressed by the 
winners.

86
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:12,460
That way you can dispense with any such 
thing as competence,

87
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:13,294
for example,
or failed to notice the effect that say 

88
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:16,414
hard work has on fostering success.
I know that there are campuses in the 

89
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:24,271
United States now where it's considered 
a microaggression to make the claim that

90
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:29,380
people who work hard make more money 
than people who don't work hard anyways.

91
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,950
You can also claim.
Then once you've claimed that the losers

92
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:34,900
are losing because they're oppressed by 
the winners,

93
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,080
you can claim unearned allegiance with 
the losers.

94
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,903
Feel secure in your comprehensive 
explanation of the world because you've 

95
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:44,620
got everything wrapped up.
You've got five axioms.

96
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,810
That's all you need.
You can explain everything with them.

97
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,003
Then you can revel in your moral 
superiority and you have the additional 

98
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:54,190
benefit of being able to target your 
resentment towards your newly discovered

99
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:55,024
enemies.
So any rot or blackness that you happen 

100
00:05:58,431 --> 00:05:59,264
to be harboring in your soul,
you can vent towards these people that 

101
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,194
are hypothetical oppressors and that 
that means that you can be a terrible 

102
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:08,060
person and you can feel good about it at
the same time.

103
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,590
Then you can repeat that forever in 
every possible circumstance everywhere,

104
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,210
and that's the PC gate.
Now,

105
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:17,120
we've been looking into that fair bit 
with our research.

106
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,430
I'm working very hard with my graduate 
student,

107
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:20,264
Christine Brophy right now,
my phd student trying to get our first 

108
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:25,550
paper on political correctness ready for
release,

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,830
but I can give you some,
some more,

110
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,960
some information about it.

111
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,523
We did a video with rebel media about,
we weren't as articulate as we might've 

112
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:34,963
been about it,
so I'm going to give it another shot 

113
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,210
here.
So,

114
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,710
Oh,
before I do that,

115
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,113
another element of the PC game,
this is part of the pc philosophy 

116
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,660
defined injustice as any equality of 
outcome.

117
00:06:46,661 --> 00:06:49,790
I would like to give you an update about
the University of Toronto Human Resource

118
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,770
and Equity Department's training 
material.

119
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:52,604
They decided they were going to make 
antibiose and antiracism training 

120
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,863
mandatory for their staff and I made my 
second video back in late September 

121
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,010
about that and somebody slipped the 
training material underneath my door.

122
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,143
And one of the things I found out that 
was absolutely distressing was that the 

123
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,983
consultant who was hired to do the 
antiracism and antibiose training was 

124
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:13,670
attempting to teach,
let's say.

125
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:17,450
But I would say indoctrinate the staff 
into how to analyze a,

126
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:20,570
an organization to decide if it was a 
oppressive.

127
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,090
And so basically what you do is you take
the organization,

128
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,790
imagine that it's a pyramid and it has 
different strata.

129
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,300
Then you assess each strata,
you assess it demographically,

130
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,000
so you assess it by group identity,
race,

131
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:32,834
gender and so forth.
I suppose sexual preference and all the 

132
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:35,864
other things that the PC authoritarians 
like to go on and on about constantly 

133
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,393
and defined people.
And then you match each strata of the 

134
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,970
organization against the general 
population.

135
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,590
And if the demographics don't match 
exactly.

136
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:49,424
So if there aren't say 51% women and 2% 
gay people and maybe 6% native people 

137
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:58,040
and whatever,
whatever makes up the population,

138
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,293
then you define the organization as 
inequitable and regarded as corrupt and 

139
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:07,280
in need of modification.
There's obvious problems with that.

140
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:08,480
Not least.
That being,

141
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:12,860
that quality of outcome is perhaps the 
most pernicious of Marxist doctrines.

142
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:13,694
And the attempt to impose that on entire
populations in the Soviet Union and in 

143
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,913
Mao's China resulted in the deaths of 
millions of people and we collect the 

144
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,200
Cold War to stop claims that he,
quality of outcome was the,

145
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,860
was the optimal metric by which to 
measure society's progress.

146
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,530
So that's the University of Toronto hr 
department.

147
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:31,364
They're not at equity.
Not only are they taking advice from a 

148
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:34,154
group of radicals who won't disavow 
violence in their pursuit of social 

149
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:37,244
change,
but now they're basically pushing what 

150
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:42,980
can only be called communist propaganda 
from like the 1930s on their employees.

151
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,810
It's absolutely appalling.
Kelly Hannah Moffit,

152
00:08:45,811 --> 00:08:46,644
who's the vice president of human 
resources and equity should promptly 

153
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:50,414
resigned.
So a little bit about the historical 

154
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:55,690
basis of these,
uh,

155
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,533
ideas.
I would say that the political correct 

156
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:02,550
authoritarian types are fundamentally 
influenced by two philosophers.

157
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:03,750
One,
Karl Marx,

158
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,003
uh,
who was the father of communism and his 

159
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:08,274
basic principle was from each according 
to his ability to each according to his 

160
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:14,010
need.
Now that sounds good.

161
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:14,844
And it was a good enough slogan to 
attract the attention of intellectuals 

162
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:19,314
everywhere in to other people as well.
The problem comes in its practical 

163
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:27,201
application and the problem is who 
determines what constitutes need?

164
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,970
Because it's very,
very difficult to decide if my need say,

165
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:32,804
because I have a father with Alzheimer's
is greater than your need because you 

166
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:39,390
have a daughter with cancer and a wife 
who's an alcoholic.

167
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,990
So who the hell parses up need?
And,

168
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:45,690
and the problem of course also is the 
need is infinite.

169
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,973
And it's also no easy matter to 
determine whether or not each person is 

170
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,860
contributing according to his or her 
ability.

171
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,723
And that's partly why we have a free 
market because these sorts of things 

172
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:57,570
cannot be determined by central 
authorities.

173
00:09:57,571 --> 00:09:59,700
And as soon as they are,
then all hell breaks loose.

174
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,953
And the other part of the PC philosophy 
horror show is Jacques Derrida and 

175
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:04,884
Jacques Derrida,
I think was the most dangerous person 

176
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:09,480
who lived in the 20th century.
Well maybe not because he had to compete

177
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:10,314
with Hitler and mio and Stalin.
So maybe that's a bit of an 

178
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:13,524
overstatement.

179
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,270
It probably is.
Darin,

180
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:16,104
I think.
I think you might describe him as a 

181
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:20,760
philosopher of extreme resentment and 
he's a real trickster.

182
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:25,110
He basically claimed that human 
categorization is for exclusion.

183
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,230
And so the postmodernist,
he's a postmodernist,

184
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:29,064
basically claimed that there's no truth,
there's only competing power games 

185
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:32,964
essentially.
And that the reason that you categorize 

186
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:38,130
the reason that human beings categorize 
is to further their power games.

187
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:38,964
And so categorization is for exclusion.
You don't form a club so much to keep 

188
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:45,540
people in as to keep people out to,
and that's part of your power game.

189
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,374
And that's of course absolutely 
ridiculous because one of the things 

190
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:52,200
that happens when you categorize is for 
is that you exclude things.

191
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:55,020
Otherwise every category contains 
everything that exists.

192
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,000
And so what the hell good is a category 
like that.

193
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:57,834
Obviously categories exclude the idea 
that that's why we categorize is 

194
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,370
preposterous.

195
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,893
We categorize to simple simplify the 
world so that we can operate on it 

196
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:07,584
properly.
And so we generalize across discreet 

197
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:12,750
entities so that we don't have to deal 
with every single discreet entity.

198
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,410
And the reasons that we categorize are 
quite complex.

199
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,993
We tend to categorize things in the same
category if they can be used for the 

200
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:23,190
same purpose because we're basically 
tool using creatures.

201
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,293
We don't so much categorize because 
things have the same objective 

202
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:30,480
properties because things have many 
objective properties and so,

203
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,314
but we do tend to categorize things as 
similar if they can be used for similar 

204
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:34,824
purposes.
That's an extension of our tool using 

205
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:37,194
capacity into the cognitive domain and 
dare to also claimed essentially that 

206
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:41,484
there's nothing outside the text and so 
for the postmodernists everything 

207
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:48,900
fundamentally is interpretation.
Everything is subjective and you can see

208
00:11:48,901 --> 00:11:49,734
that reflected say and legislation like 
bill see 16 which which insists that 

209
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:58,591
gender identity and identity in general 
I would say is only subjectively defined

210
00:11:58,661 --> 00:11:59,494
which is of course also observed because
your identity is something that you 

211
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,730
negotiate with other people.

212
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,563
If you're older than two,
and I mean that technically because two 

213
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:07,984
year olds are egocentric and they have a
hard time negotiating anything with 

214
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:12,364
other children and they can't really 
learn to do that until there were about 

215
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:15,874
three and and most kids are pretty good 
at it by the age of four but if they 

216
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:19,594
don't get it by the age of four,
then it's very difficult for them to 

217
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:23,020
make friends for the rest of their life.
They,

218
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,063
they get excluded from the peer groups 
and then they don't stay abreast of 

219
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:31,090
their peers and they end up up alienated
and often antisocial.

220
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,380
It's really not good to construe.
Identity isn't only subjective,

221
00:12:34,381 --> 00:12:37,600
is unbelievably psychologically and 
philosophically primitive.

222
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:38,434
And the other thing about identity that 
should be noted is that identity also 

223
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:44,140
has functional utility.
So if you're,

224
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,840
if you have a genuine identity,
so if you're an artist,

225
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:47,674
say,
or a lawyer or a businessman or a 

226
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:53,500
plumber or a nurse or a physician,
you're identity is something that,

227
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,873
it's a set of skills that you use to 
operate in the social and the natural 

228
00:12:57,641 --> 00:12:59,920
world.
And so there's plenty outside the text.

229
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:04,300
Anyways,
I was thinking today about who Karl Marx

230
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:07,720
and Jacques Derrida would produce as a,
as a child,

231
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:08,554
as an offspring,
if they ever were able to meet 

232
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,430
successfully.
And this is what I came up with.

233
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,620
Yeah,
it'd be the joker.

234
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:16,000
And,
and here's why.

235
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,300
Here's a great scene from the Batman 
movie that's each herd Heath Ledger,

236
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:22,870
who really had the horror of resentment 
down to a,

237
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,890
to a science.

238
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,690
Oh,
so could I say I?

239
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,260
So look,
I told you I'm a man of my word.

240
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,440
Where is he?
Italian.

241
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,450
Well,
I'll talk to [inaudible] to verge on the

242
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:38,284
location in 20 minutes.
I want auxiliary units to cover all 

243
00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:42,190
possible get away routes.

244
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:47,100
Please don't go to mind what you'll go 
with all your money.

245
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,360
You see how the guy have simple taste.
I enjoy,

246
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:56,361
yeah,
dynamite and gunpowder and gasoline

247
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,180
and you know a thing that they have in 
common.

248
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:11,190
Eric sheet
all I am,

249
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,773
I'm only burning my half.
All you care about is money deserves a 

250
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,320
better class.
I'm going to give it the don't

251
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,140
tell you're mad thing work for me.
This is my setting

252
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,670
so you can see that when the joke or 
does get his share of the money,

253
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,730
he doesn't want to use it for anything.
It's not the point.

254
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:41,520
The point is to gather it so that it can
be destroyed.

255
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,350
Just to show that all he is is a 
destroyer and there are plenty of people

256
00:14:46,351 --> 00:14:47,184
who were only destroyers and I certainly
regard the malevolent and of the Pc 

257
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,930
Authoritarians as fundamental 
destroyers.

258
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:56,180
They want to bring down everything 
because the resentful,

259
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,380
they're resentful right to the core and 
that's a very powerful human motivation.

260
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:01,880
You see that reflected,
for example,

261
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:02,714
in the biblical story of Cain and Abel,
which is really the story of the first 

262
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:09,260
two human beings because Adam and eve 
were made by God.

263
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,633
So the story goes,
Cain and Abel were the first genuine 

264
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:13,574
human beings and they instantly lock 
themselves into a murderous embrace 

265
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:20,920
where one was very resentful of the 
other success and uh,

266
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,590
ended up in fact killing him despite the
fact that he was his ideal.

267
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,370
That's a cautionary tale for everyone.
So I want to tell you a little bit about

268
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:31,910
our research.
So we took 192 political items,

269
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:32,763
uh,
that we gathered by analyzing what had 

270
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:40,280
been discussed in the media as elements 
or instances of political correctness.

271
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:44,090
We tried to be agnostic about it and 
gather as many statements as we possibly

272
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:44,924
could.
And then we subjected them to a 

273
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,650
statistical procedure called a factor 
analysis,

274
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:51,190
which helps sort beliefs into their 
categories.

275
00:15:51,191 --> 00:15:53,660
And two beliefs go in the same category.
If,

276
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,050
if you agree with one,
you're likely to agree with the other or

277
00:15:57,051 --> 00:15:59,780
if you disagree with when you're likely 
to disagree with another,

278
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,720
you can see patterns of covariants it's 
called,

279
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:03,554
but patterns of similarity within data 
sets and it's an agnostic pro process 

280
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:09,380
because it's,
it's purely computational.

281
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:13,220
It's an eight I would say it's about as 
atheoretical approaches can possibly be.

282
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,113
Matt managed in in a science,
we found that there were two clumps of 

283
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:21,080
politically correct belief.
We called one pc liberalism and here's a

284
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:24,350
couple of examples of things that pc 
liberals particularly belief.

285
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,463
Other question would be rate the degree 
to which you think the following 

286
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,830
constitute evidence of an unjust system.
If you're a PC liberally,

287
00:16:31,831 --> 00:16:36,831
you believe that societies in just 
because or unjust because only 5% of the

288
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,040
fortune 500 companies have women as 
ceos.

289
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,933
Because in 2013 the poverty rate for 
blocks in the U s was 27% well for 

290
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:45,824
whites it was 10% and because 64% of 
physicians and surgeons are men in the 

291
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:51,494
United States.
So that means that societies unjust pc 

292
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:54,974
liberals agree with such things as the 
world is warming because of the human 

293
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:01,220
species burns too much fossil fuel 
believe that racial,

294
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,800
ethnic and gender quota should exist in 
employment.

295
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,300
Believe that government interventions 
should exist in schools and companies to

296
00:17:08,301 --> 00:17:12,170
ensure equality and professions where 
there's a historically large inequality.

297
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,183
So that's partly quality of outcome.
That's the beliefs that clump together 

298
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:20,060
to make the set of beliefs that we 
described this pc liberalism.

299
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,910
And so here's what the PC authoritarians
look like.

300
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:27,200
They are in favor of censorship.
So they believe that books,

301
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:28,034
including the dictionary,
movies and art should be censored for 

302
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:35,591
offensive slash racist slash sexist 
discriminatory language and ideas.

303
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,020
So they're pro censorship.
They believe in punishment.

304
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:40,460
For Racist,
sexist,

305
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:41,294
or homophobic slurs.
And they also believe in retooling the 

306
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:45,620
justice system.
So for example,

307
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:46,454
they believe that an alleged perpetrator
of sexual assault should have to prove 

308
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,763
his or her innocence,
reversing the standard western legal 

309
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:54,570
doctrine of innocent before proven 
guilty.

310
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,273
They believe that students suspected of 
sexual assault should be suspended 

311
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,993
pending further investigation.
So that means that a suspicion is 

312
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:06,780
sufficient to disrupt someone's life.
And they believe that is wrong,

313
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:10,680
to criticize the status and rights of 
women under Islam because that is racist

314
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:12,750
and disrespectful of multiculturalism.

315
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,720
So that's the PC authoritarian set of 
beliefs.

316
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,800
Here's what predicts whether or not you 
believe those things.

317
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:20,634
So if you,
if you're going to believe the set of 

318
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:24,720
beliefs that characterizes pc 
liberalism,

319
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,853
then the best predictors were that you 
had attended a politically correct 

320
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:29,844
seminars.
So that shows you exactly how powerful 

321
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:32,570
propaganda is.
And,

322
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:35,790
and the answer is very,
you're verbally intelligent.

323
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:37,710
So the more verbally intelligent you 
are,

324
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:41,040
the more you believe the PC liberal line
you're hiring openness.

325
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,430
And that's a big five trait that's 
associated with creativity.

326
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,640
You're agreeable,
particularly compassionate.

327
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:50,340
So agreeableness is another big five 
train that's associated,

328
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:51,174
I would say with maternal behavior,
especially on the compassionate and 

329
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,413
you're more likely to be female,
you're more likely to be educated and 

330
00:18:56,521 --> 00:19:00,480
you're more likely to be gay.
Whereas if you're a PC authoritarian,

331
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,590
you have low verbal intelligence and and
low intelligence in general,

332
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,450
high disgust sensitivity.

333
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,660
And that's been associated with 
conservatism in the past.

334
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:11,940
So the pc out there tarion's or are 
weird,

335
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,960
a hybrid between agreeableness say 
which,

336
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:15,803
which puts them on a pc spectrum and the
same kind of orderliness and disgust 

337
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,770
sensitivity that seemed to characterize 
right wing authoritarians.

338
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,023
Ah,
you're more likely to be nonwhite 

339
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,733
religious with a low income female 
diagnosed with an anxiety or mood 

340
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:31,050
disorders.
So that might account for the desire for

341
00:19:31,051 --> 00:19:33,210
space,
a safe spaces and such things.

342
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,820
A agreeable,
compassionate down,

343
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:36,660
polite.
And again,

344
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,523
the best way to think about 
agreeableness is as a maternal 

345
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,013
dimension.
And that's I think why pc people treat 

346
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:46,470
everyone as if there are children and 
you're conscientious but orderly,

347
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,880
orderly,
not,

348
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,743
not industrious.
These factors are only correlated at 

349
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:53,310
0.12.
So these are not the same people.

350
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,263
And we think the PC liberals are 
basically apologists for the PC 

351
00:19:56,671 --> 00:19:57,504
authoritarians,
so I want to read you a letter that I 

352
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:04,170
received recently,
the details that I just wanted to say.

353
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,003
Thanks for standing up for your beliefs 
for others and for free speech in the 

354
00:20:08,311 --> 00:20:09,144
face of what I know must be a very 
continuous and publicly attempted 

355
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:12,894
shaming.
I'm a liberal and a feminist in my late 

356
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,480
thirties until a few weeks ago when I 
begin checking out your videos.

357
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,060
I would have described myself as a third
wave feminist.

358
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,780
I graduated from the University of 
British Columbia with a major in biology

359
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:25,614
and a minor in women's studies.
I believe I was part of the early wave 

360
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:29,244
of this pc authoritarian indoctrination.
The difference being I remember being 

361
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:36,630
encouraged to have open dialogue back 
then in my women's studies classes,

362
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,930
we didn't have trigger warnings are safe
spaces that came later.

363
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,480
I ended up finding myself working in 
entertainment,

364
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,910
which I now believe is influenced 
heavily by academia.

365
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:45,983
For the past 15 years or so,
I've managed careers of Comedians and 

366
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:49,474
I've always been drawn to comedians with
a message having adored folks like Bill 

367
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,250
Hicks,
Richard Pryor and George Carlin.

368
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:55,823
Overtime comedians with a message 
eventually came to me comics who are 

369
00:20:58,901 --> 00:21:02,260
living in this social justice or your 
bubble as am I.

370
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,753
For almost 20 years I lived in this echo
chamber and watched as social justice 

371
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:09,490
academic concepts grew to mainstream 
influence,

372
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,383
which I applaud it but at some point it 
started realize that in these concepts 

373
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:17,170
of equality and inclusion,
at least in my online world have morphed

374
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:18,004
into this strange cult of belief that 
discourages descent discussion or free 

375
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:23,470
speech and thought.
As I mentioned,

376
00:21:23,471 --> 00:21:26,800
most of this came after I graduated so I
saw it unfold online.

377
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,310
I think social media for all of the good
is it has brought us,

378
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,520
has allowed us to become more isolated 
than ever before possible.

379
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,270
My entire facebook and twitter feeds are
full of sjws.

380
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,253
This is the echo chamber I self selected
and most of them are in an all out 

381
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:43,660
assault on differing opinions and on 
each other.

382
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,500
Right now
perhaps because of the result of the U s

383
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:48,334
election.
There are a few of us within my echo 

384
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:50,674
chamber who are trying to share a 
thoughtful articles that attempt to 

385
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,760
answer the question,
how did trump get elected?

386
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:55,923
No matter the nuanced and intelligent 
content of these articles or the pains 

387
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:00,154
too,
which I'm seeing folks try and present 

388
00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:02,044
them in a non offensive way to anyone 
who may not agree the sjws are 

389
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,410
cannibalizing these folks.
To be clear,

390
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,633
these are also liberals who have been 
considered a part of the same community 

391
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:12,754
until now who are being thrown out,
unfriended and ganged up on in this 

392
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,134
social media public shaming way.
Now you see that's a good indication of 

393
00:22:20,801 --> 00:22:24,310
why I'm reading this letter.
It's because our research indicates that

394
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,430
there are two clumps of belief in the pc
cap,

395
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,403
the liberal type beliefs,
but but they're strongly influenced by 

396
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:32,554
trait agreeableness,
which is not the case with with let's 

397
00:22:34,391 --> 00:22:35,224
say normal liberalism and the PC 
authoritarians and there are strange 

398
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:39,700
bedfellows,
let's,

399
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:43,540
let's put it that way and they don't 
really agree and given the opportunity,

400
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:46,000
the PC authoritarians will eat the PC 
liberals.

401
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,580
So this is a warning to upc liberal 
types.

402
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,653
You should stop apologizing and acting 
as intelligent and articulate 

403
00:22:53,891 --> 00:22:54,724
mouthpieces for the PC authoritarians.
They are not your friends and they're 

404
00:22:57,761 --> 00:22:58,594
pro censorship and this throwing people 
out cannibalizing as as mentioned in 

405
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:03,514
this letter is precisely the attempt to 
impose a censorship on their so called 

406
00:23:07,301 --> 00:23:10,540
allies while they aren't your allies.
And that's exactly what you're seeing.

407
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,603
These are allies doing their best to try
to understand why trump won so we can 

408
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:16,864
best change course and sway people to 
our liberal point of view and they are 

409
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:21,700
being told that they need to check their
privilege,

410
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:25,120
that they are only posting these things 
because if they're unconscious racism.

411
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,163
Yeah.
That's the sort of thing that the 

412
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,870
University of Toronto is trying to train
their staff out of,

413
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,273
that they are part of the white 
supremacist culture and that they are 

414
00:23:32,231 --> 00:23:33,660
not allies,
et cetera.

415
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,930
It saddens me because I now believe it's
this kind of censorship and divisiveness

416
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:38,764
and willingness to write people off by 
putting them in a bigot box that caused 

417
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:42,634
the trump backlash to begin with.
I think these folks unconsciously 

418
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,091
actually,
yeah,

419
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:47,924
well I'm not so sure it's unconscious,
but it might be pushing more and more 

420
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:51,884
people out of the left and ensuring the 
trump will win again in 2020 ultimately 

421
00:23:55,461 --> 00:23:56,294
I think they are ensuring that our 
country will only become more polarized 

422
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,190
into this us versus them mentality.
Yeah.

423
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:02,024
You see the reason I don't think that's 
so much unconscious as the women's 

424
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:07,460
studies websites all say,
if you go read them,

425
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:08,294
they're out to destroy the patriarchy,
which is basically indistinguishable 

426
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:12,224
from Western civilization,
so it's not so sure to clear me that 

427
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:17,930
it's unconscious.
I think they are propelling the very old

428
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:22,130
right that they see to oppose for many 
of these people in my timeline,

429
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,240
this is their career.

430
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,800
They are all churning out online article
after article right now about how racism

431
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:30,290
is to blame for the election and if you 
think anything else,

432
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:31,124
you're a racist about how white people 
need to wear a safety pin to show their 

433
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,993
allies about how white people need to 
take the safety pins off now because 

434
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:39,134
it's embarrassing and only shows that 
they want validation for being good 

435
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,104
white people.
Piece upon piece about something so 

436
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:50,240
trivial as a safety pin and I see 
countless privileged sjws in my timeline

437
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,580
wringing their hands and posting long 
status updates,

438
00:24:52,581 --> 00:24:56,870
asking how to be the best ally they can 
to more marginalized folks and how these

439
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,760
contradictory articles or confusing 
them.

440
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,090
Well of course they are.
If you're only waiting to be told how to

441
00:25:02,091 --> 00:25:05,420
be a good human being because you bought
into the idea that you're privileged,

442
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:08,000
presents you from your right to your own
opinions and choices,

443
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,953
then you will be pulled by each and 
every contradictory and incendiary 

444
00:25:11,271 --> 00:25:12,620
opinion piece like this.

445
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,850
I'm sorry for the long winded email we 
started off as a simple thank you.

446
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:17,863
I started watching your videos a little 
before the election because I saw folks 

447
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:23,840
in my timeline labeling you a 
transphobic and I looked a little deeper

448
00:25:23,841 --> 00:25:25,940
only to be surprised that I disagreed 
with them.

449
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,373
From there,
I started listening to some of your 

450
00:25:28,131 --> 00:25:28,964
lectures while at the gym.
I particularly enjoyed the tragedy 

451
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,840
versus evil talk and the Cain and Abel.
Ella.

452
00:25:33,841 --> 00:25:34,674
Gloria stayed with me for weeks now in 
almost every choice I make ass as it 

453
00:25:37,821 --> 00:25:38,654
should and I am learning to live well,
being vulnerable to unravel what I 

454
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:46,460
actually believe about things 
independent of this sg w ideology I have

455
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,294
been subscribing to for so long.
I now see that it's not so different 

456
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:50,624
than the conservative fundamentalist 
ideology I was raised in and took 

457
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,650
several years to shed in my teens.

458
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,800
I don't think I understood the full 
meaning of that Nietzsche quote.

459
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,970
He who fights with monster should be 
careful lest he thereby become a monster

460
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,910
and if thou gaze long into an abyss,
the abyss.

461
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:08,900
We'll also gaze into the,
until I began listening to your lectures

462
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:09,734
and reflecting on the actions I've seen 
in my community slash echo chamber 

463
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:15,650
recently,
so thank you for that to finally,

464
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:16,484
I am sure you have many people assisting
you and I'm going to contribute to your 

465
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:21,500
patriot,
but if you ever need additional help,

466
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:25,880
especially on any of the sjw magic words
and conversation stopping tactics,

467
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:26,983
let me know.
I have lived without ideology as my 

468
00:26:28,611 --> 00:26:32,120
religion for so many years and I know 
the language well.

469
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,283
Well that's an excellent letter and so 
thank you very much to the writer of 

470
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:38,420
that letter who I've taken some pains to
disguise.

471
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,990
Here's something that Milton Friedman 
said about inequality.

472
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,490
Uh,
Milton Friedman was someone,

473
00:26:44,491 --> 00:26:47,310
the Economist magazine called the most 
influential economists,

474
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,223
the second half of the 20th century.
He's often put into the conservative 

475
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,800
camp of,
of economists,

476
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,113
a society that puts equality before 
freedom will get neither a society that 

477
00:26:58,681 --> 00:27:02,040
puts freedom before he quality.
We'll get a high degree of both.

478
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,040
Well,
something to think about.

479
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,240
Now I should also say that the anti pc 
stickers are still for sale.

480
00:27:09,241 --> 00:27:10,074
I'll put the link back below the apse in
development and that was the APP that 

481
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:14,034
will help us locate where the bulk of 
poster activity is that's associated 

482
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:22,350
with politically correct activity.
And we have a web page and development.

483
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:23,184
The idea for the web pages to allow 
people to upload policy documents from 

484
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:27,954
companies and other institutions as well
as governments that are fundamentally 

485
00:27:31,771 --> 00:27:32,604
politically correct in the origin,
and to track their developmental course 

486
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:36,384
so that we can start to figure out who's
behind these sorts of things and what 

487
00:27:38,731 --> 00:27:41,130
might be done to stop them.
So anyways,

488
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,993
that's all for now.
I hope that you are able to tune into 

489
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:45,834
the debate.
Uh,

490
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,840
just a reminder that's Saturday,
November 9th at 9:30 AM eastern standard

491
00:27:51,241 --> 00:27:52,074
time,
and it will be livecast on Jordan 

492
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,170
Peterson videos.
Thank you very much for watching.

493
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,423
Bye Bye.
