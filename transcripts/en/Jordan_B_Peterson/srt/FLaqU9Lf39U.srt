00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,533
Hi,
I'm in the dressing room at the Palace 

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,740
Theater in Louisville,
Kentucky on June 14th,

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:08,603
2018,
and I thought I'd read you an excerpt 

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,990
from maps of meaning the architecture of
belief,

5
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:16,824
which is a book I published in 
[inaudible] Ninety nine with routledge 

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:21,863
and it's been the basis of my youtube 
lectures and I would say also 12 rules 

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,023
for life,
a lot of the ideas and 12 rules for 

8
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:29,814
life.
Her first worked out with maps of 

9
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:31,514
meaning by just recorded an audio 
version of the book was released two 

10
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:37,110
days ago,
June twelfth,

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,140
2018 and it's available from penguin 
books on audible.

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,970
I'll put the links in the description of
the video.

13
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,750
I'm hoping that the audio version with 
its careful intonation will be easier to

14
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:53,604
understand.
Maps of meaning is a rather difficult 

15
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:56,500
book.
Um,

16
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,130
in any case,
I'm going to read you an excerpt from it

17
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:03,030
today and that'll serve as a bit of an 
introduction to the book.

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,510
I'll make some more excerpts over the 
next coming weeks I think as well,

19
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:07,800
but we'll start with this one.

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,793
I was reading Jeffrey Burton,
Russell's Mephistopheles the devil in 

21
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:16,224
the modern world.
When I came across his discussion of 

22
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:24,051
dusty huskies,
the brothers Karamazov Russell Discusses

23
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:25,524
Ivan's argument for Atheism,
which is one of the most powerful ever 

24
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:29,634
mounted.
Ivan is one of the brothers and the 

25
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:36,681
brothers Karamazov Ivan's examples of 
evil all taken from the daily newspapers

26
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:40,470
of 18,
76 are unforgettable.

27
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,263
The nobleman who orders is hounds to 
tear the peasant boy to pieces in front 

28
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:46,254
of his mother,
the man who whips his struggling horse 

29
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,710
on its gentle eyes,
the parents who lock their tiny daughter

30
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:56,280
all night in the freezing privy while 
she knocks on the walls,

31
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,143
pleading for mercy,
the Turk who entertains a baby with a 

32
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:03,090
shiny pistol before blowing his brains 
out.

33
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:08,610
Ivan knows that such horrors occur daily
and can be multiplied without end.

34
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,450
I took the case of children.
Ivan explains to make my case clearer of

35
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:17,610
the other tiers with which the earth is 
soaked.

36
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,283
I will say nothing.
Burton Russell's states the relation of 

37
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:25,014
evil to God has in the century of 
Auschwitz and Hiroshima once again 

38
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:32,310
become center of Philosophical and 
theological discussion.

39
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,730
The problem of evil can be stated 
simply,

40
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,690
God is omnipotent.
God is perfectly good.

41
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,780
Such a God would not permit evil to 
exist,

42
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,290
but we observed that evil exists,
therefore God does not exist.

43
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,630
Variations on this theme are nearly 
infinite.

44
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,710
The problem is not only abstract and 
philosophical.

45
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,440
Of course,
it is also personal and immediate.

46
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,800
Believers tend to forget that they're 
god takes away everything that one cares

47
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:05,230
about possessions,
comforts,

48
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,920
success,
professional craft knowledge,

49
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,230
friends,
family and life.

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,633
What kind of God is this?
Any decent religion must face this 

51
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:17,254
question squarely and no answer is 
credible that cannot be given in the 

52
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:21,574
face of dying children.
It seems to me that we use the horrors 

53
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:31,040
of the world to justify our own 
inadequacies.

54
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,473
We make the presumption that human 
vulnerability is a sufficient cause of 

55
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:36,614
human cruelty.
We blame God and God's creation for 

56
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:40,874
twisting and perverting our souls and 
claim all the time to be innocent 

57
00:03:44,151 --> 00:03:49,151
victims of circumstance.
What do you say to a dying child?

58
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,740
You say you can do it.
There is something in you that is strong

59
00:03:56,111 --> 00:04:01,111
enough to do it and you don't use the 
terrible vulnerability of children as an

60
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:06,751
excuse for the rejection of existence 
and the perpetration of conscious evil.

61
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,793
When I wrote maps of meaning,
I did not have much experience as a 

62
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:16,890
clinical psychologist to have my 
patients,

63
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:17,724
however stayed in my mind.
The first was a woman about 35 years 

64
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,760
old.
She looked 50.

65
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,920
She reminded me of a medieval peasant of
my conception of a medieval peasant.

66
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,620
She was dirty clothes,
hair,

67
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,543
teeth,
dirty with the kind of fill that takes 

68
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:38,430
months to develop.
She was unbearably shy.

69
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,380
She approached anyone who she thought 
was superior in status to her,

70
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,550
which was virtually everyone hunched 
over with her eyes,

71
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:48,384
shaded by her hands,
both hands as if she could not tolerate 

72
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:52,554
the light emanating from her target.
She had been in behavioral treatment in 

73
00:04:57,781 --> 00:04:58,614
a Montreal hospital before as an 
outpatient and was in fact a site known 

74
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:04,044
to the permanent staff at the clinic.
Others had tried to help her overcome 

75
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,590
her unfortunate manner of self 
presentation,

76
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,530
which made people on the streets shy 
away from her,

77
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,920
made them regard her as crazy and 
unpredictable.

78
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,960
She could learn to stand or sit up 
temporarily with eyes unguarded,

79
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,500
but she reverted to her old habits as 
soon as she left the clinic,

80
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,743
she may have been intellectually 
impaired and consequences of some 

81
00:05:30,391 --> 00:05:31,224
biological fault.
It was difficult to tell because her 

82
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:37,410
environment was so appalling.
It may have caused her ignorance.

83
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,693
She was illiterate as well.
She lived with her mother whose 

84
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,660
character I knew nothing about and with 
an elderly desperately ill bedridden,

85
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,170
and her boyfriend was a violent 
alcoholic.

86
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:55,800
Schizophrenia who mistreated her 
psychologically and physically,

87
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,903
who was always muddling simple mind with
tirades about the devil and the worship 

88
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:04,760
of Satan.
She had nothing going for her.

89
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,100
No beauty,
no intelligence,

90
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,070
no loving family,
no skills,

91
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,640
no employment,
nothing.

92
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,120
She didn't come to therapy to resolve 
her problems.

93
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:19,790
However,
nor to unburden her soul,

94
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,930
nor to describe her mistreatment and 
victimization at the hands of others.

95
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,663
She came.
She came because she wanted to do 

96
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:31,520
something for someone who is worse off 
than her.

97
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,563
The clinic where I was interning was 
associated with a large psychiatric 

98
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:36,794
hospital.
All of the patients that still remained 

99
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:39,734
after the shift to community care in the
aftermath of the sixties were so 

100
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:46,640
incapacitated that they could not 
survive on the streets.

101
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,613
She had done some volunteer work,
have some limited type in that hospital 

102
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,250
and decided that she could maybe be 
friend,

103
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:58,430
a patient,
take him or her outside for a walk.

104
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,443
I think she got this idea because she 
had a dog when she walked regularly and 

105
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:04,694
when she liked to take care of.
All she wanted from me was help 

106
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:09,044
arranging this,
help finding someone who she could take 

107
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,374
outside,
help finding someone in the hospital 

108
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:17,750
bureaucracy who would allow this to 
happen.

109
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,120
I was not very successful in aiding her,
but she didn't seem to hold that against

110
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:23,954
me.

111
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,423
It is said that one piece of evidence 
that runs contrary to a theory is 

112
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:32,600
sufficient to disprove that theory.
Of course,

113
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,410
people do not think this way and perhaps
should not,

114
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,813
in general theory is to useful,
to give up easily to difficult to 

115
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:42,944
regenerate and the evidence against 
should be consistent and believable 

116
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,683
before it is accepted,
but the existence of this woman made me 

117
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:52,244
think she was destined for a 
psychopathological end from the 

118
00:07:56,931 --> 00:07:57,764
viewpoint of biological and 
environmental determinism faded as 

119
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:06,791
surely as anyone I had ever met and 
maybe she beat her dog sometimes and was

120
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:08,144
rude to her sick and maybe I never saw 
her vindictive or unpleasant even when 

121
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:17,870
her simple wishes were thornton.
I don't want to say that she was a saint

122
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,390
because I didn't know her well enough to
tell,

123
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,270
but the fact was that in her misery and 
simplicity,

124
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:27,440
she remained without self pity and able 
to see outside of herself.

125
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,980
Why wasn't she a criminal,
cruel,

126
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,080
unbalanced,
and miserable.

127
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,740
She had every reason to be,
and yet she wasn't in her simple way.

128
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,420
She had made the proper choices.
She remained bloody but unbowed,

129
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,373
and she seemed to me rightly or wrongly,
to be a symbol of suffering humanity 

130
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,570
solely afflicted,
yet capable of courage and love.

131
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,120
God

132
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,110
justifies his creation in Milton's 
paradise lost

133
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,630
such I created all the theory,
powers and spirits,

134
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,250
both them who stood and them who failed,
not free.

135
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,760
What proof could they have given sincere
of true allegiance,

136
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:17,660
constant faith or love.
We're only what they needs must do,

137
00:09:17,661 --> 00:09:19,580
appeared,
not what they would.

138
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:25,190
What praise could they receive?
What pleasure I from such obedience paid

139
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,880
when will and reason,
reason also his choice,

140
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,350
useless and vein of freedom.
Both despoiled made passive.

141
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:36,590
Both had served necessity,
not me.

142
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,473
They therefore has to write belonged,
so we're created nor can justly accused 

143
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:46,844
there maker or they're making or their 
fate as if predestination overruled 

144
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:56,810
there will dispose by absolute decrease 
or high for knowledge.

145
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,260
They themselves decreed their own 
reformed,

146
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,950
nor I if I for new,
for knowledge,

147
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:07,580
has no influence on their fault which 
had no less proved,

148
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:08,414
certain unfair known,
so without least impulse or shouting or 

149
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,560
fade or art by me.
Immutably foreseen they trespass authors

150
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:23,590
to themselves in all both what they 
judge and what they choose for.

151
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:24,614
So I formed them free and free.
They must remain until they throw 

152
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,853
themselves.
I must change their nature and revoke 

153
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:35,750
the high decrease,
unchangeable,

154
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,840
eternal which ordain their freedom.
They themselves or Dane their fall.

155
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,343
The other patient I wish to describe 
what's the schizophrenia in a small 

156
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:48,644
inpatient ward at a different hospital.
He was about 29 when I met him a few 

157
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,303
years older than I was at the time and 
had been in and out of confinement for 

158
00:10:58,161 --> 00:10:58,994
seven years.
He was of course on anti psychotic 

159
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:03,194
medication and participated in 
occupational therapy activities on the 

160
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:07,514
ward,
making coasters and pencil holders and 

161
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:10,664
so on,
but he could not maintain attention for 

162
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:15,860
any amount of time.
It was not even much good at craft.

163
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,740
My supervisor asked me to administer an 
intelligence test to him.

164
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,823
The standard wastes are more for the 
sake of my experience than for any 

165
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:27,710
possible diagnostic.
Good.

166
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,113
I gave my patients some of the red and 
white blocks that made up the block 

167
00:11:32,481 --> 00:11:36,050
design subtests.
He was supposed to arrange the blocks,

168
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,840
so they matched a pattern printed on 
some cards.

169
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,393
He picked them up and started to 
rearrange them on the desk in front of 

170
00:11:43,431 --> 00:11:44,031
him.
Well,

171
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:49,031
I timed him stupidly with a stopwatch.
The task was impossible for him.

172
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,073
Even at the simplest of stages.
He looked constantly distracted and 

173
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:59,680
frustrated.
I asked what's wrong?

174
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,353
He said,
the battle between good and evil in 

175
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:06,040
heaven is going on in my hand,
and

176
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,520
I stopped the testing.
At that point,

177
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,010
I didn't know exactly what to make of 
his comment.

178
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,150
He was obviously suffering and the 
testing seem to make it worse.

179
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,350
What was he experiencing?
He wasn't lying,

180
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,260
that's for sure.
In the face of such a statement.

181
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:28,350
It seemed ridiculous to continue.
I spent some time with him that summer.

182
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,440
I'd never met someone who was so 
blatantly mentally ill.

183
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,603
We talked on the ward and occasionally I
would take him for a walk through the 

184
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:38,080
hospital grounds outside.

185
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:42,250
He was the third son of first generation
immigrants.

186
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,060
His first born brother was a lawyer.
The other physician,

187
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,390
his parents were obviously ambitious for
their children,

188
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,253
hardworking and disciplined.
He had been a graduate student working 

189
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:59,590
towards a degree in immunology.
They don't precisely remember.

190
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,420
His brothers had sent him a daunting 
example and he felt pressured to succeed

191
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,230
his experimental work and not turned out
as he had expected,

192
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,093
however,
and he apparently came to believe that 

193
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:15,250
it might not graduate,
not at least when he had hoped to,

194
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:21,210
so he faked his experimental results and
wrote up his thesis.

195
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,713
Anyway,
he told me that the night he finished 

196
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:25,954
writing,
he woke up and saw the devil standing 

197
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:28,924
over him at the foot of his bed.
This event triggered the onset of his 

198
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:35,380
mental illness from which he had never 
recovered.

199
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,743
It might be said that the satanic 
apparition merely accompanied the 

200
00:13:41,141 --> 00:13:41,974
expression of some pathological stress 
induced neuro development whose 

201
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:46,954
appearance was biologically 
predetermined or the devil was merely 

202
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:52,600
personification of his culture.

203
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,433
His conception of moral evil manifesting
itself in imagination as a consequence 

204
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:02,860
of his guilt.
Both of these levels of description have

205
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:03,694
their merits,
but the fact remains that he saw the 

206
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:11,101
devil and that division accompanied or 
even was the event that destroyed him.

207
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,090
He was afraid to tell me much of his 
fantasy and it was only after I had paid

208
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:18,700
careful attention to him that he opened 
up.

209
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,750
He was not bragging or trying to impress
me.

210
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,793
He was terrified about what he believed,
terrified as a consequence of the 

211
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:29,890
fantasies that impressed themselves upon
him.

212
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,503
He told me that he could not leave the 
hospital because someone was waiting to 

213
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:37,300
shoot him.
A typical paranoid delusion.

214
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,950
Why did someone want to kill him?
Well,

215
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,660
he was hospitalized during the Cold War,
not at its height perhaps,

216
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,643
but still during a time when the threat 
of purposeful nuclear annihilation 

217
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,770
seemed more plausible or likely than it 
does now.

218
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,323
Many of the people I knew used the 
existence of this threat to justify to 

219
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:04,220
themselves their failure to participate 
fully in life,

220
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,443
a life which they thought of 
Romantically as doomed and therefore as 

221
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:10,574
pointless,
but there were some real terror in the 

222
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,124
pose and the thought of the countless 
missiles pointed here and there around 

223
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:17,360
the world,
sap,

224
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:20,960
the energy and faith of everyone 
hypocritical or not,

225
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:22,903
my schizophrenia patient believed that 
he was in fact the incarnation of the 

226
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,094
world.
Annihilating force that he was destined 

227
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:31,883
upon his release from the hospital to 
make his way south to a nuclear missile 

228
00:15:35,691 --> 00:15:36,524
silo on American territory that he was 
faded to make the decision that would 

229
00:15:40,281 --> 00:15:41,114
launch the final war.
The people outside the hospital knew 

230
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:48,590
this and that is why they were waiting 
to shoot him.

231
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,730
He did not want to tell me this story 
and consequence,

232
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,713
although he did because he thought that 
I might then want to kill him to my 

233
00:15:58,911 --> 00:16:00,200
friends in graduate school.

234
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,740
Thought it ironic that I had contact 
with a patient of this type,

235
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:04,843
my peculiar interest in young and 
young's ideas regarding the collective 

236
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:09,104
unconscious.
We're well known to them and it seemed 

237
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:11,874
to absurdly fitting that I would end up 
talking to someone with delusions of 

238
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:16,004
this type,
but I didn't know what to do with his 

239
00:16:18,531 --> 00:16:19,364
ideas.
Of course they were crazy and they had 

240
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:26,150
done in my patient,
but it still seemed to me that they were

241
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,013
true from the metaphorical viewpoint.
His story in totality linked is 

242
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:33,194
individual choice between good and evil 
with the cumulative horror then facing 

243
00:16:37,311 --> 00:16:38,144
the world.
History implied that because he had 

244
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:42,950
given into temptation at a critical 
juncture,

245
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,040
he was in fact responsible for the 
horror of the potential of nuclear war,

246
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,263
but how could this be?
It seemed insane to me to even consider 

247
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:55,184
that the act of one powerless individual
could be linked in some manner to the 

248
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:03,581
outcome of history as a whole,
but I am no longer so sure.

249
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,373
I've read much about evil and its manner
of perpetration and growth and I'm no 

250
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:12,380
longer convinced that each of us are so 
innocent,

251
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,333
so harmless.
It is of course a logical to presume 

252
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,784
that one person,
one speck of dust amongst $6 billion 

253
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:24,830
moats is any sense responsible for the 
horrible course of human events,

254
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,443
but that course in itself is not logical
far from it and it seems likely that it 

255
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:34,520
depends on processes that we do not 
understand.

256
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,380
The most powerful arguments for the 
nonexistence of God,

257
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,543
at least a good God are predicated on 
the idea that such a being would not 

258
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:48,851
allow for the existence of evil in its 
classical natural diseases.

259
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,930
Disasters or moral war pogroms forms.
Such arguments can be taken further even

260
00:17:57,031 --> 00:18:02,031
than atheism can be used to dispute the 
justice of the existing world itself.

261
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:08,670
Dostoevsky states,
perhaps the entire cosmos is not worth a

262
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:13,671
single innocent child suffering.
How can the universe be constructed such

263
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:15,414
that pain is permitted?
How can a good God allow for the 

264
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:19,674
existence of a suffering world?
These difficult questions can be 

265
00:18:24,531 --> 00:18:28,580
addressed in part as a consequence of 
careful analysis of evil.

266
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,693
First,
it seems reasonable to insist upon the 

267
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:36,520
value of the natural slash moral 
distinction.

268
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,953
The tragic circumstances of life should 
not be placed in the same category as 

269
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,710
willfully undertaken.
Harm.

270
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,533
Tragedy,
subjugation to the mortal conditions of 

271
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:49,834
existence has an ennobling aspect,
at least in potential and has been 

272
00:18:53,951 --> 00:18:58,390
constantly exploited to that end in 
great literature and mythology.

273
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,920
True evil by contrast is anything but 
normal.

274
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,473
Participation in Alex whose sole purpose
is expansion of innocent pain and 

275
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:09,914
suffering destroys character forthright 
encounter with tragedy by contrast may 

276
00:19:15,171 --> 00:19:16,004
increase it.
This is the meaning of the Christian 

277
00:19:18,441 --> 00:19:23,441
myth of the crucifixion.
It is Christ's full participation in and

278
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,700
freely chosen acceptance of his fate,
which he shares with all mankind.

279
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:33,620
That enables him to manifest his full 
identity with God at it is that identity

280
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:37,700
which enables them to bear that fate and
which strips it of evil.

281
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,050
Conversely,
it is the voluntary demeaning of our own

282
00:19:42,051 --> 00:19:42,884
characters which makes the necessary 
tragic conditions of existence appear 

283
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,193
evil,

284
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,463
but why is life tragic?
Why are we subject to unbearable 

285
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:57,100
limitation to pain,
disease,

286
00:19:57,101 --> 00:20:01,090
and death to cruelty at the hands of 
nature and society?

287
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,210
Why do terrible things happen to 
everyone?

288
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,080
These are of course unanswerable 
questions,

289
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,880
but they must be answered somehow.
If we are able to face our own lives,

290
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,430
the best I can make of it is this.
This has helped me.

291
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,493
Nothing can exist without preconditions.
Even a game can be played without rules 

292
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,613
and the rules say what cannot be done as
much as what can perhaps the world is 

293
00:20:31,751 --> 00:20:35,380
not possible as a world without its 
borders.

294
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,573
Without its rules,
maybe existence wouldn't be possible in 

295
00:20:40,661 --> 00:20:45,661
the absence of our painful limitations.
Think of it this way.

296
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:49,450
If we could have everything wanted 
merely for wishing it,

297
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:54,810
if every tool performed every job,
if all men were omniscient and immortal,

298
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,880
that everything would be the same,
the same,

299
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:58,714
all powerful thing,
God and creation would never exist and 

300
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,733
is the differences between things which 
is a function of their specific 

301
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:11,560
limitations that allows them to exist at
all,

302
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,113
but the fact that things do exist does 
not mean that they should exist even if 

303
00:21:18,321 --> 00:21:21,860
we are willing to grant them their 
necessary limitations.

304
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,713
Should the world exist?
Are the preconditions of experience so 

305
00:21:28,071 --> 00:21:28,904
terrible that the whole game should be 
called off and there is never any 

306
00:21:33,171 --> 00:21:36,800
shortage of people working diligently 
towards this end.

307
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,570
It seems to me that we answer this 
question implicitly,

308
00:21:41,571 --> 00:21:42,404
but profoundly.
When we lose someone we loved and then 

309
00:21:45,561 --> 00:21:48,860
grieve.
This is a very common experience.

310
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:53,150
I don't think we cried because they 
existed either,

311
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,310
but because they are lost.

312
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:01,430
This presupposes a judgment rendered at 
a very fundamental level of analysis.

313
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,903
Grief presupposes having loved 
presupposes the judgment that this 

314
00:22:07,171 --> 00:22:11,010
person's specific bounded existence was 
valuable,

315
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,903
was something that should have been even
in it's inevitably imperfect and 

316
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:19,440
vulnerable form,
but still the question lingers,

317
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,460
why should things even loved things 
exist at all?

318
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,390
If they're necessary limitations caused 
some suffering.

319
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,400
Perhaps we could reserve answer to the 
question of God's nature,

320
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,300
his responsibility for the presence of 
the evil in creation,

321
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,390
until we have solved the problem of our 
own.

322
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,733
Perhaps we can tolerate the horrors of 
the world if we left our own characters 

323
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:45,923
intact and develop them to the fullest.
If we took full advantage of every gift 

324
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:51,844
we had been granted,
perhaps the world would not look 

325
00:22:56,211 --> 00:22:57,044
horrible

326
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,393
then

327
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,453
that was from pages 3:43 to three slash 
47 from maps of meaning published in 

328
00:23:07,401 --> 00:23:11,450
Nineteen Ninety nine audio version 
released June twelfth,

329
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,523
2018.
I'll read some excerpts in the coming 

330
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,890
days and weeks.
Thanks very much.

331
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:20,803
Bye Bye.
