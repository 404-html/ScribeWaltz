1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,710
So I,
I know you can't tell,

2
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:05,370
but you're looking at a new and improved
version of me today because I just

3
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:09,210
finished the Canadian government's
online ethics course and so my,

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,930
my capacity to manifest ethical behavior
has been improved by an immeasurable

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,343
amount.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,543
So.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,180
Okay,
so today we're gonna.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,370
Talk about something that's actually
quite controversial,

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,990
although I guess what we talked about
last lecture was rather controversial to

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,510
people hate this topic generally
speaking,

11
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,410
and it's because like there's nothing
ever.

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,400
There's never any guarantee that if you
investigate things from a scientific

13
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:48,150
perspective that you're going to learn
things that you want to learn or that

14
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:51,300
you're happy about knowing or that you
wish were that way.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,760
I mean,
I would say one of the big advantages to

16
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:57,720
the scientific method is that it
presents you with data that you don't

17
00:00:57,721 --> 00:00:58,554
like.

18
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,563
Okay.

19
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,670
Be Most of the time when you learn
something,

20
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:06,600
it's because you're running into
something that you don't like or don't

21
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:07,500
want,
right?

22
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:12,000
Because otherwise,
when the world is unfolding in front of

23
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:14,070
you,
exactly as you predict and hope there's

24
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:17,130
nothing to learn,
you almost always run into an impediment

25
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:19,410
of one form or another before you ever
learn anything.

26
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,470
So we're going to talk about openness
today,

27
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,850
how that sounds rather innocuous in and
of itself,

28
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,880
but the problem is is that
openness is the place in the big five

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,090
were Iq hides,
especially

30
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,420
nonverbal Iq,
which is most specifically associated

31
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:46,290
with fluid Iq.
How?

32
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,710
The thing about intelligence is that
it's not like the big five,

33
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,480
it's unit dimensional in most regards,
so you know if you do the proper factor

34
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:59,680
analysis with the entire Corpus of trait
descriptors in language,

35
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:02,950
you end up with five dimensions.
There's no superordinate single

36
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:06,070
dimension.
You can make a case for plasticity and

37
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:09,340
stability,
but the actual utility of that higher

38
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:14,341
order factor structure has yet to be
demonstrated in a multiplicity of

39
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:19,840
situations.
We have some evidence for with regards

40
00:02:19,841 --> 00:02:23,770
to plasticity and stability.
That plasticity is predicted more by

41
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:28,690
what people do and stability is much
more predicted by what people don't do.

42
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,100
Now I don't know how useful that is.
I mean it's kind of an interesting fact.

43
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:35,980
It was an incredibly powerful effect,
but

44
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,920
I'm plasticity seems to be associated
more with exploratory behavior and

45
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,680
perhaps with dopaminergic function and
stability,

46
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,120
perhaps more with the control and
constraint of behavior and Sarah Tender

47
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,740
Jake function,
but it's still pretty vague,

48
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,430
so you can certainly make a case for
the.

49
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,670
For the hierarchy of factor structure
with regards to trades to of top out at

50
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:04,810
the five factor level with some
possibility of a of an informative level

51
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:08,410
above that
ideal isn't like that.

52
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:14,490
It's pretty damn unit dimensional and
it's complicated because there does seem

53
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:19,690
to be some utility in,
in distinguishing between verbal and

54
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:23,500
nonverbal intelligence or fluid in
crystallized intelligence depending on

55
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:25,930
how you look at it.
And I think the distinction is basically

56
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:30,931
this is the fluid intelligence roughly
is a measure of how rapidly you can

57
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:36,391
learn things and then crystallized
intelligence roughly is an indication of

58
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:40,390
how much you've learned and then you can
see why those two things would be very

59
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:41,410
highly correlated.

60
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:44,680
Right?
Because how much you know is obviously

61
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:47,170
going to be a function of how fast you
can learn,

62
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,100
but you could also see that there would
be some circumstances under which those

63
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:54,070
two things could be dissociated.
So one of the things that happens,

64
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:56,350
for example,
as you get older,

65
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:01,120
your fluid Iq drops quite precipitously
and it starts doing that somewhere in

66
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:04,120
your mid twenties.
So there's some of you are already

67
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:07,390
getting stupider,
which is kind of annoying at least from

68
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,710
the perspective of the ability to learn,
but you're crystallized Iq or your

69
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:13,750
verbal Iq depending on how you look at
it,

70
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,700
can continue to rise for the rest of
your life as you put more information

71
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:20,080
into yourself,
so to speak.

72
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:25,081
And some of that might be a measurement
artifact somewhat because the way that

73
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:29,860
you test verbal or crystallized
intelligence generally is by asking

74
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:33,520
people about their knowledge of
something.

75
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,470
Maybe it's their vocabulary,
for example,

76
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:38,650
which is an excellent measure of verbal
intelligence as you might expect,

77
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:41,260
probably because it's an index of how
much people read.

78
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,980
That would be my guess or general
inflammation tests.

79
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,580
Um,
which is what a sample of your required

80
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:51,170
factual knowledge and so forth,
um,

81
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,670
that sort of thing can increase as you,
as you age,

82
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:59,590
as your ability to learn,
decreases the best way.

83
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,150
By the way,
if you want to keep your intelligence in

84
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:05,080
tact,
the best way to do that is to,

85
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:08,350
uh,
to exercise just so you know it.

86
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,160
Um,
both weightlifting and

87
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,220
cardiovascular exercise can maintain
your fluid intelligence to quite a

88
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:23,650
remarkable degree across the course of
your life.

89
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:27,040
And the reason for that likely is that
your brain is a pretty vascularized

90
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:31,450
Oregon and use uses a tremendous amount
of your body's oxygen and energy.

91
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:35,650
And so if your cardiovascular system
isn't in that good a shape than what

92
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:39,760
seems to happen is that it's harder for
your brain to get rid of waste products

93
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:43,660
that are produced during.
It's during it's metabolic processes.

94
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:48,661
And so you can't work as efficiently.
There's not a lot of evidence that brain

95
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:53,950
games of one form or another can produce
any real positive effect.

96
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:57,080
Although they're scattered reports in
the literature that video games can

97
00:05:57,081 --> 00:05:57,914
improve,

98
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,140
that can improve spatial intelligence,
which is a subset of intelligence,

99
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:08,430
even though it's very highly correlated
with fluid intelligence in domains other

100
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:10,320
than the game.
Usually what happens if you.

101
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,950
If you get people to develop expertise
at a game that requires abstract

102
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:15,180
ability,
like a video game,

103
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:18,030
what happens is they get tremendously
better at the thing that they're

104
00:06:18,031 --> 00:06:20,520
practicing,
but there doesn't seem to be a lot of

105
00:06:20,521 --> 00:06:25,521
transfer of ability to different games
and and what fluid intelligence is in

106
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:30,120
large part is what's common across
multiple.

107
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,840
The ability that's common across
multiple complex tasks,

108
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:38,160
whatever that ability happens to be.
Now we don't know exactly what that

109
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:42,600
ability is,
partly because we don't really know very

110
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:45,420
much about how the brain works,
but we definitely know how to measure it

111
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,770
and that irritates people.

112
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,460
So Iq fits under openness and the
terminology is still a little bit,

113
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,830
I would say awkward
for a while when people were trying to

114
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:04,640
sort out what the fifth factor was,
the openness factor.

115
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,260
Some people thought about it as
intellect and some people thought about

116
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:12,710
it as openness and it it ended up being
named openness.

117
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,220
When we did our aspect study back in
2007,

118
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:20,720
we broke it up into openness to
experience proper and intellect.

119
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:25,640
So those seem to be aspects of the
higher order trait and the aspect level

120
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:28,910
differentiation actually turned out to
be realm rather useful,

121
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,090
at least at least so far.
So one of the things we just published a

122
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:35,630
study for example,
showing that if you are higher in

123
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,040
openness to experience the aspect,
you were more likely to be in the

124
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,310
humanities and if you were hiring
intellect you are more likely to be in

125
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:44,690
the sciences for example.

126
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:48,710
So anyways,
what we'll do first is we're going to

127
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:50,960
talk a little bit about intelligence per
se,

128
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:55,340
and then we'll talk about the trait.
The reason I want to talk about Iq

129
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,290
really,
because really that's what I'm talking

130
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:01,730
about is because the best measure of the
intellect aspect isn't a big five

131
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,450
personality questionnaire.
It's actually an Iq test and so and it's

132
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,550
very,
very important to understand ICU and

133
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:11,210
there's a bunch of reasons for this.
First reason is that Iq is more

134
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:16,211
powerfully predictive of long term life
success than any other phenomena that

135
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:21,401
can be measured among human beings and
not only that,

136
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,820
the statistics that were derived
statistics that were used to derive Iq

137
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:33,190
tests and then use to predict future
performance are exactly the same

138
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:37,160
statistics that every social scientists,
particularly psychologists,

139
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:41,030
every social scientist uses to do all of
their statistics.

140
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:46,330
So you can't criticize that derivation
of Iq tests on statistical grounds

141
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,890
without criticizing every single finding
in psychology that's ever been made by

142
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:52,760
anyone ever since.

143
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,130
We started to use statistics and I would
say not only that,

144
00:08:56,131 --> 00:09:00,600
the best statisticians that psychology
has ever produced are the people who

145
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:05,370
invented and promoted and developed and
tested Iq tests.

146
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,670
So there's no getting out of it by
saying that there's something,

147
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,740
something faulty about the statistics.
So for example,

148
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,640
Stephen Jay Gould,
who is a famous evolutionary biologist

149
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:22,260
and pretty radical left wing thinker.
He debated.

150
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,130
He had a public debate at one point
about what he called the mismeasure of

151
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:30,570
man because he wasn't very much of a fan
of Iq tests and he claimed that Iq tests

152
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:34,860
were faulty because they relied on
factor analysis and because basically

153
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:39,861
what Iq is is the first factor that you
draw out of a huge battery of questions

154
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:45,180
that require abstraction.
Any kinds of questions you'll find that

155
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,450
if people do well on one question,
they tend to do well at all the other

156
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:49,230
questions.

157
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,140
That's the general factor and he said,
well,

158
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:55,710
that's just a factor and that's means
it's a mathematical abstraction and that

159
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,630
means that it's not real.
It's like,

160
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:58,620
well,
first of all,

161
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,040
the first factor that you derive out of
the performance indices for our very

162
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:07,050
large number of answers to abstract
questions,

163
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:09,840
it's almost perfectly correlated with
the average.

164
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,020
The mean,
and so that's tantamount to saying that

165
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:17,350
the mean is a mathematical abstraction
and therefore doesn't really exist and

166
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,320
well.
Then you have a problem which is.

167
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:20,131
Well,
exactly.

168
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:23,970
What do you mean by exists?
Because you can certainly make a case

169
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:27,080
that mathematical abstractions are more
real than the thing that they're

170
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,490
abstracted from.
If that wasn't the case,

171
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:31,470
then mathematics wouldn't be so
powerful.

172
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,070
So basically Gould's argument boiled
down to the idea that there's no such

173
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:37,140
thing as an average.
Well,

174
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,790
this is part of what makes me a
pragmatist philosophically.

175
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,570
I mean there is such thing as an average
in so far as calculating the average and

176
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:49,860
then using it produces certain results
that you desire in order to deal with

177
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:51,060
the world.
Right?

178
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:55,350
So the average of a group of numbers is
a tool of some sort and you know,

179
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:58,410
it's obviously doesn't contain all the
information that the entire set of

180
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:02,850
numbers contained.
You need at least a standard deviation

181
00:11:02,851 --> 00:11:05,030
to get at that as well because that
talks to you about the,

182
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,160
the range.
No,

183
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,500
the variability,
but the idea that the average isn't a

184
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:12,360
real thing is,
you know,

185
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,630
it's silly,
it's a,

186
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,940
it's a shallow criticism.
It's also based on complete lack of

187
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:20,970
knowledge about exactly what factor
analysis does and doesn't do.

188
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,360
So now
here's a list of some inter correlations

189
00:11:31,031 --> 00:11:35,110
here between the various facets or the
various aspects,

190
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,630
just so you know how tightly associated
they are.

191
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:42,280
So industrious and industriousness and
orderliness or correlated at about point

192
00:11:42,281 --> 00:11:44,890
four.
That's from conscientiousness,

193
00:11:44,891 --> 00:11:48,040
volatility and emotional stability at
about point five,

194
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,920
nine.
Politeness and compassion out about

195
00:11:50,921 --> 00:11:51,940
point four,
four.

196
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,580
Assertiveness and enthusiasm at about
point four slash seven.

197
00:11:59,581 --> 00:12:03,240
And openness and intelligence about
point three five.

198
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,840
So openness and intelligence seemed to
be somewhat maximally differentiated as

199
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:13,560
far as aspects Go.
So the average correlation between the

200
00:12:13,561 --> 00:12:15,810
big five is our equals point two,
two.

201
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,350
And the correlation between the big two
is our equals point to four.

202
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,950
So God just gives you some idea of how
much segregation and how much overlap

203
00:12:25,021 --> 00:12:27,870
there is between the different aspects
underneath the trait level.

204
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,560
Let's see.

205
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,700
So
what I should really tell you first I

206
00:12:52,701 --> 00:12:55,820
guess is how is how to conceptualize
ICU.

207
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,120
Yeah,
this is a good one.

208
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,830
So you want to follow this carefully so
that so that you,

209
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,040
you,
you can explain it to yourself and so

210
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,950
that you can explain it to other people.
So here,

211
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,860
let's say you want to make an Iq test,
so this is what an Iq test is.

212
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:15,380
The first thing you might imagine that
is that

213
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,020
you have a huge library of questions and
there'll be questions that could be

214
00:13:22,021 --> 00:13:24,780
formulated in language or some other
symbolic manner.

215
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,870
Often they don't have to be but often,
and then they require skill or knowledge

216
00:13:30,451 --> 00:13:34,230
to answer.
So here's some typical questions and you

217
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:37,260
can generate multiple exemplars of
questions like this.

218
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,620
What's two times 68?
What's the capital of Georgia?

219
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,440
How do you fight?
How do you define hyper tricks?

220
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:44,860
Anemia?
Um,

221
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,700
complete the pattern.
Two,

222
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,421
four,
eight,

223
00:13:48,421 --> 00:13:50,970
16.
Remember these numbers?

224
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,050
Two,
four.

225
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,390
Then you'd tell them back to me,
six,

226
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:55,290
12,
15,

227
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,220
14,
18,

228
00:13:56,221 --> 00:13:57,360
20,
22.

229
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,570
You tell them back to me.
That's a working memory task by the way.

230
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:04,590
But working memory is basically
indistinguishable from intelligence in

231
00:14:04,591 --> 00:14:05,424
many,
many ways.

232
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,590
So then,
you know,

233
00:14:07,591 --> 00:14:09,510
another thing I might have you do for
examples,

234
00:14:09,511 --> 00:14:14,040
I might show you a pattern made out of
squares and then give you some blocks

235
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,590
and so that you could make the pattern
out of the blocks.

236
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,440
And then time you to see how long it
took you,

237
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:23,610
or maybe I'm only giving you a certain
amount of time and if you didn't do it,

238
00:14:23,611 --> 00:14:25,870
then you either pass or fail.
Um,

239
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,670
I might show you some patterns.
This is like a Raven's progressive

240
00:14:29,671 --> 00:14:33,060
matrices test,
which is one of the most tests that is

241
00:14:33,061 --> 00:14:37,590
the most accurate at assessing nonverbal
intelligence or fluid intelligence.

242
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:42,210
So I might show you six patterns,
six designs.

243
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,700
Each design changes are,
sorry,

244
00:14:44,701 --> 00:14:46,100
eight designs.
Imagine that,

245
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:48,420
three by three array,
three here,

246
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,460
three here,
two here,

247
00:14:50,461 --> 00:14:53,390
and a question mark.
And then over here I'd show you a bunch

248
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:56,870
of options of patterns and one of the
patterns would complete the sequence and

249
00:14:56,871 --> 00:15:01,080
usually you could calculate the sequence
going down or across and,

250
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,610
and diagonally as well.
And that looks somewhat like a working

251
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:09,410
memory task in that usually the Raven's
progressive matrices patterns involve a

252
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:13,250
couple of different variables,
like it might be color and shape or

253
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:17,330
something like that.
And so in order to complete the task,

254
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:20,630
you have to figure out how the color is
transforming and figure out how the

255
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:24,170
shape is transforming.
Or maybe in a more complex Raven's

256
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:27,740
matrices question,
it would be color,

257
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,730
shape and position on the page or
something like that.

258
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:34,700
So you're increasing the number of
dimensions that have to be attended to

259
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,370
simultaneously in order to solve the
problem.

260
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,743
So,

261
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,350
so one of the things that's quite
interesting about the Iq test,

262
00:15:43,351 --> 00:15:46,700
it really doesn't matter what the
questions are and so.

263
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:48,890
So anyways,
so imagine you have a whole pile of

264
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:51,980
these questions lying around like a
universal pile,

265
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:56,780
well universal library of potential
questions that require abstraction to

266
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:59,990
solve.
And then you take a random set of 100 of

267
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:04,991
those and then you give that to a
thousand people and then you just score

268
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:11,020
some up there.
You just sum up their scores.

269
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,110
Then you rank order them in terms of
their performance.

270
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,190
And that's Iq.
It's as simple as that.

271
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:25,080
Now you could do some other things.
You could correct it for the age of the

272
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:28,100
participant.
Now sometimes that's useful and

273
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,380
sometimes it's not.
But you could do that.

274
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:35,220
And generally if you standardize the
score and you correct it for age than

275
00:16:35,221 --> 00:16:40,221
what you get as an Iq score,
I would say so actually the the total

276
00:16:40,411 --> 00:16:42,930
would just be an indicator of general
cognitive ability.

277
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:47,400
The IQ score would be the indicator of
general cognitive ability corrected for

278
00:16:47,401 --> 00:16:49,380
age.
And that's it.

279
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,160
That's all.
And so here's some of the strange

280
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:54,900
properties of,
of,

281
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,620
of that set of scores.
If you factor analyze the data set,

282
00:16:58,621 --> 00:17:02,640
you'll pull out one factor and a few
little bitty factors after that.

283
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:07,440
And that factor will be very,
very highly correlated with the sub so

284
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:09,590
correlated at point nine,
point nine,

285
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,740
two point nine,
three,

286
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:14,430
like really highly correlated,
far more highly correlated.

287
00:17:14,431 --> 00:17:16,500
Then most tests are

288
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,680
far more highly correlated that most
tests are reliable.

289
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,250
Now another thing that's very
interesting is you've taken another set

290
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:30,360
of 100 questions and you give them to
the same thousand people and then you

291
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,630
rank order the people and then you
correlate the rank orders.

292
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:37,080
You get what I'm saying,
the correlation between the rank order.

293
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:41,220
So be like point nine five.
So what it means is no matter which set

294
00:17:41,221 --> 00:17:44,730
of 100 questions you take out of this
universal library of questions,

295
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,600
people are going to score in the same
order that they scored when they did the

296
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:52,590
first hundred questions.
And that means that Iq is extremely

297
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:53,910
reliable,
test,

298
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:55,260
retest,
reliability.

299
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,830
This is actually even strip more
stringent form of reliability,

300
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:03,831
which is alternative forum reliability.
So that's all there is to our ICU.

301
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:11,030
It's very simple.
Now why it is that the ability to do

302
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:17,000
well on one of those questions is highly
correlated with the ability to do all

303
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:19,610
the rest of them.
That's something that nobody really

304
00:18:19,611 --> 00:18:22,520
understands.
I think it has to do with the human

305
00:18:22,521 --> 00:18:26,210
capacity to abstract.
Like we can abstract and we can

306
00:18:26,211 --> 00:18:29,030
manipulate abstractions.
It's not obvious that there's any other

307
00:18:29,031 --> 00:18:33,710
creatures that can do that and it seems
to be in some sense modular.

308
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:39,700
Anything that can be abstracted and then
manipulated draws on exactly the same

309
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:43,190
set of underlying skills.
Whatever those happen to be.

310
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,523
Now

311
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,141
you might say,
well,

312
00:18:50,141 --> 00:18:52,480
so what?
Which is a perfectly reasonable thing to

313
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:54,130
say,
and so what is.

314
00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:00,210
If you then take that rank quarter
and let's say you take the same thousand

315
00:19:00,401 --> 00:19:03,980
people 20 years later and you rank order
them in terms of how well they're doing

316
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,710
their job,
you could just use income,

317
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,680
say as a marker,
there's other markers you could use,

318
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:11,980
but for the sake of simplicity,
let's say income,

319
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,720
the correlation between their original
rank order and the rank order of their

320
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:21,670
performance will be something around if
you had a full sample of intelligence,

321
00:19:21,671 --> 00:19:24,940
be something around point five,
which is

322
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,320
point five is a staggeringly high
correlation,

323
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,190
so you know,
you'll hear that when you hear people

324
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:35,470
talk about effect sizes,
you'll hear them say that.

325
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:40,300
Point two is a small effect size and
point three is a medium effect.

326
00:19:40,301 --> 00:19:42,020
Size and point.
Sorry,

327
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,270
point point five is a medium effect size
and so forth.

328
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,560
What you find out if you look at the
literature empirically is that point

329
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,080
effect.
Size is a point five correlations of

330
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:56,470
point five are vanishingly rare in the
social sciences.

331
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,800
If you ever do a study with a reasonable
number of people with a novel measure

332
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,710
and you're predicting something with it,
if you get a correlation of point five,

333
00:20:05,711 --> 00:20:07,960
boy,
you're jumping around the room because

334
00:20:07,961 --> 00:20:10,420
that's only gonna happen like once in
your life,

335
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,780
unless you're measuring something that
someone who has already measured and you

336
00:20:13,781 --> 00:20:16,390
just don't know it.
And so it's,

337
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,590
it's fair.
It's a,

338
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:22,591
it's a reasonable to point out that the
correlation between Icu say and academic

339
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:27,130
performance or the correlation between
Iq and longterm career success,

340
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:31,420
the size of that correlation is bigger
than the correlation between virtually

341
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,830
to,
to,

342
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,080
uh,
virtually any other things that social

343
00:20:35,081 --> 00:20:39,760
scientists have ever discovered.
And the thing about it too is it's very

344
00:20:39,761 --> 00:20:40,594
straightforward.

345
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,760
You know what the procedure that I just
told you,

346
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:44,920
anyone can replicate that.
You know,

347
00:20:44,921 --> 00:20:48,100
you're not going to come up with a
universal library of obviously,

348
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:50,950
but you can use the internet as a
reasonable proxy.

349
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:56,670
So not only is Iq easy to understand
from a measurement perspective,

350
00:20:57,671 --> 00:21:00,430
it's also the tests are very,
very easy to replicate in.

351
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:05,431
They're extremely powerful predictors.
Now it turns out actually that Iq is

352
00:21:06,611 --> 00:21:11,611
correlated more strongly with how
rapidly you learn a task than it is with

353
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:15,640
your performance per se,
so the correlation between rate of

354
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:20,200
learning of something novel and Iq can
be as high as six or point seven,

355
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,380
which you know,
the other bit of that would probably be

356
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:27,400
taken up by something like
conscientiousness or openness or

357
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:31,600
negatively with emotional stability.
So you're picking up a tremendous amount

358
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:35,800
of the variation between in people's
performances with that single measure

359
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,460
and you can derive a pretty decent
indicator of Iq in 20 minutes,

360
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:42,340
which is also pretty frightening,
you know,

361
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:45,100
so.
Well.

362
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,070
So that's our cute.
Does anybody have any questions about

363
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:49,840
that?
Yes.

364
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,400
Well you have to formulate them in
language.

365
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,223
That's all.

366
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:14,220
Now a lot of people have complained
about the idea of intelligence because

367
00:22:14,221 --> 00:22:17,640
they don't like the idea.
They don't really mind the idea so much

368
00:22:17,641 --> 00:22:21,750
that there are smart people,
but people really don't like the idea

369
00:22:21,751 --> 00:22:24,300
that are,
there are dumb people and you know,

370
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:24,810
it's,
it's,

371
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,390
it's,
it's really not reasonable from a

372
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:29,820
logical perspective to have one without
the other.

373
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:35,150
And it's easy to see why people object
to that because whatever term you use to

374
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:41,001
refer to the low end of the intelligence
distribution rapidly takes on a

375
00:22:41,071 --> 00:22:45,770
pejorative nature.
So and so what happens is the culture

376
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,690
cycle through various words,
decade by decade,

377
00:22:48,691 --> 00:22:52,830
trying to describe the lower end of the
intelligence distribution,

378
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,170
but all the words ended up being
pejorative.

379
00:22:55,171 --> 00:22:58,110
And so they're,
they're changed decade after decade.

380
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:04,450
But you and you can understand that
because first of all,

381
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:09,010
there's great danger in labeling someone
unintelligent perhaps period.

382
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,530
But certainly if there's measurement
error,

383
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,540
you know,
so if you're labeled on intelligent,

384
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,430
let's say,
and you're not,

385
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:19,390
that's going to be real catastrophe.
So there's measurement error problems,

386
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,830
but then you know,
you have to think about the problems of

387
00:23:25,831 --> 00:23:27,630
not doing the measurement.

388
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,690
So this is something I've thought about
for a long time.

389
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:33,524
So

390
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:40,630
let's say that I assessed your verbal Iq
before you came to the University of

391
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,930
Toronto.
Forget linguistic differences as soon we

392
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,720
control for that,
which is very difficult at the

393
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,090
University of Toronto because there's so
many people who have English as a second

394
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:51,920
language.
But forget about that for a minute.

395
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,150
Let's say I got a entire population
distribution,

396
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,240
not only of the applicants from the
University of Toronto but over the

397
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:03,230
entire population,
and I said categorically that the bottom

398
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:07,250
30 percent of the people in that
distribution would not be able to

399
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:12,251
graduate from the University of Toronto.
Am I doing them a favor by not letting

400
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:17,591
them apply or am I harming them
while we know perfectly well?

401
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:23,300
I mean the probability that there's
anybody in this room that has an Iq of

402
00:24:23,301 --> 00:24:26,570
less than 115 is pretty damn low.
And if,

403
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:31,130
if there is someone in the room who's
general intelligence level is at that

404
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:33,200
level,
you can bloody well be sure they're

405
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:35,750
working like mad dogs in order to keep
up.

406
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,530
And I'm not saying that all of you who
have to work like mad dogs to keep up,

407
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,520
you know,
are,

408
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,020
are necessarily a lower than you might
be an ICU.

409
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:49,910
I'm just saying that because Iq and part
seems to be a measure of something like

410
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:53,270
processing speed or rate of
understanding or something like that.

411
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:58,310
If you're not in the upper echelons of
the distribution and you're tasked with

412
00:24:58,311 --> 00:25:01,940
extraordinarily difficult tasks that
require abstraction and quick learning,

413
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:06,650
the only way that you can compensate for
it is by working to an incredible degree

414
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,520
and you can do that.
And that's also why at the University of

415
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,020
Toronto,
we know this perfectly well and it's

416
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:14,570
true in other educational institutions.
Um,

417
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,780
conscientiousness is almost as good a
predictor of grades as intelligence and

418
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:23,030
that only makes sense to me.
It's like who the hell is going to get

419
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:23,864
the good grades?

420
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,330
The smart people who work hard and I
mean,

421
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,420
it wouldn't be good if that wasn't the
case as far as I can tell,

422
00:25:29,421 --> 00:25:34,421
because hopefully what you get when you
get a great is an indicator of how fast

423
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:35,690
you are,
how well you know,

424
00:25:35,691 --> 00:25:38,570
the material and how much effort you've
put into learning it.

425
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:42,140
Something like that.
The relationship between creativity and

426
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,000
grades at the University of Toronto is
zero,

427
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,950
by the way,
once you control for Iq,

428
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
which is,
you know,

429
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,350
perhaps rather appalling.
But the problem is,

430
00:25:50,351 --> 00:25:52,850
is that it's very difficult to assess
creative people,

431
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,770
right?
Because they're annoying,

432
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:59,360
creative people do things in a new way,
and the problem with trying to assess

433
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:02,990
whether or not someone has done saying
something in a new way is that you have

434
00:26:02,991 --> 00:26:07,190
to come up with a new scheme of grading
for that and you can believe that's not

435
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,390
going to happen,
you know,

436
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:11,540
and then it's worse because if you're a
creative person and you're graded by

437
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:13,850
someone who isn't creative,
they're not going to think you're

438
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:15,500
creative,
they're just gonna think that you're

439
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:16,334
wrong.

440
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,900
And so,
and you might be,

441
00:26:17,901 --> 00:26:19,760
because lots of times if you're
creative,

442
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:23,060
you're also wrong because it's not that
easy to come up with a novel way of

443
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:26,330
doing something or a novel hypothesis
that actually is going to be an

444
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:28,820
improvement over the previous
hypothesis.

445
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:31,880
Right?
Most of the time you're off on a tangent

446
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,400
and it's an incorrect tangent.
Now,

447
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,860
various people have criticized the idea
of a single intelligence and so they've

448
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:42,260
made.
And I guess the most famous ones

449
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:47,380
probably in last 15 years or 20 years
have been Robert Sternberg and,

450
00:26:48,091 --> 00:26:50,030
uh,
Martin Gardner.

451
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,170
Martin Gardner is not a scientist by the
way at all.

452
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:59,010
Um,
he claims directly that he doesn't

453
00:26:59,011 --> 00:27:01,620
really care if his intelligence,
his can be measured.

454
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,830
Well,
that's not that helpful because if

455
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,920
you're working as a scientist,
if what you're talking about can't be

456
00:27:07,921 --> 00:27:10,260
measured,
then it doesn't exist and you can even

457
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:11,670
make a philosophical case.

458
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:15,030
I think that if what you're talking
about can't be measured in any possible

459
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:17,430
way,
that there's no sense in assuming that

460
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:20,080
it exists.
Now Gardener is posited,

461
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:23,250
intelligence is like linguistic,
musical,

462
00:27:23,251 --> 00:27:24,540
logical,
mathematical,

463
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:26,280
spacial body,
kinesthetic,

464
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:29,240
interpersonal and interpersonal.
Um,

465
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,690
one thing you might note is that we
already have a perfectly good word for

466
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:37,410
all of those performance variability
across all those domains in so far as it

467
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:39,810
actually exists.
And that would be talent.

468
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,710
So there's no reason to confuse the word
talent with the word intelligence.

469
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,250
And the next thing that you might know
is that a lot of these so called

470
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,360
intelligences are likely captured not so
much by intelligence but by variability

471
00:27:52,531 --> 00:27:55,230
in personality traits,
which we already understand.

472
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,920
And so to throw a bunch of new terms in
like linguistic,

473
00:27:58,921 --> 00:27:59,820
musical,
logical,

474
00:27:59,821 --> 00:28:01,380
mathematical,
spacial body,

475
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:03,720
kinesthetic,
interpersonal and intrapersonal.

476
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,470
All that does is muddy that conceptual
waters,

477
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,443
it,
it adds.

478
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:10,560
Now there's a reason for that,
and the reason is fundamentally

479
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:12,690
political and the political reason is is
that

480
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,440
it is uncomfortable for people to admit
that there might be something like

481
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:24,000
actual differences,
inability that are important and under

482
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:28,380
radical.
Now I can understand why people would

483
00:28:28,381 --> 00:28:32,790
have trouble with that,
but consider the alternatives.

484
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:40,790
We know part of the reason that you're
here and we'll perhaps stay here and

485
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:44,910
will perhaps be successful in so far as
you can define success along the

486
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:49,380
dimension of career attainment,
say in your life as it unfolds from this

487
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:52,320
time onward is because you work hard.
Okay?

488
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,550
But we also know that part of the reason
that you're here is because you're

489
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,170
smart.
Now the question is,

490
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:00,750
what should you do with that from an
ethical perspective?

491
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,910
Exactly.
Should you say,

492
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,340
no,
I'm no smarter than anyone else,

493
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,330
which means that maybe you're much more
hardworking than everyone else,

494
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,640
so you're still,
you know,

495
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,590
denigrating the non achieving end of the
distribution.

496
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:19,470
Or do you say,
I've been blessed by something that's

497
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:23,700
actually beyond my control and I'm
privileged as a consequence of that,

498
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:28,260
and then decide what exactly that means
in terms of your responsibility.

499
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,560
Those are your choices,
but,

500
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,740
but to not take into account the fact
that you've been blessed at at least one

501
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:41,040
level of analysis with a favorable roll
of the die,

502
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:46,100
after the randomness dice seems to me
they completely misstate the nature of

503
00:29:47,021 --> 00:29:51,790
the causal sequences that propel you
into what's essentially a position of

504
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,590
privilege.
So,

505
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:57,520
but that by denying the differences,
the innate differences in people with

506
00:29:57,521 --> 00:30:02,410
regards to important abilities,
all you do is attribute all your success

507
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:07,411
to your own particular individual
controllable actions.

508
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:13,180
And I mean,
I'm not saying that you don't deserve

509
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:15,670
credit for your work.
It's like more power to you and all of

510
00:30:15,671 --> 00:30:16,504
that,
but

511
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,370
the idea that some people are smarter
than others,

512
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,120
that's not an idea.
That's a fact.

513
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,720
And it's an uncomfortable fact.
And the fact that we won't deal with it

514
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,960
means that people suffer unnecessarily.
So let's go back to those people in the

515
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:37,720
distribution.
I say the bottom 30 percent of the

516
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:41,830
distribution isn't going to be able to
get a degree at the University of

517
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,810
Toronto,
um,

518
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:47,920
unless they are capable of working to an
insane level and even than likely not.

519
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,453
Um,

520
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:56,010
so let's say that you have a ability
blind admission process.

521
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,020
It's random.
So everybody's name,

522
00:31:00,021 --> 00:31:02,940
ms dot thrown into a hat and if they get
pulled out,

523
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:07,970
they get to go.
You think that you're doing the people

524
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:09,700
who are going to fail a service

525
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,463
or not,

526
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,140
you know,
and now you could make a case that you

527
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:19,141
are because it's likely that they'll be
a couple of individuals in the bottom

528
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,680
part of the distribution who will make
it through partly because of measurement

529
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:24,371
error,
right?

530
00:31:24,371 --> 00:31:27,580
Because you're not going to measure this
perfectly and partly because,

531
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,220
well,
people are surprising and amazing

532
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,730
creatures and you never know exactly
what any given one of them is going to

533
00:31:33,731 --> 00:31:35,800
do,
but you're going to torture a lot of

534
00:31:35,801 --> 00:31:37,540
them to death.
At the same time.

535
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,900
You know,
I've been struggling with this because

536
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:43,180
I've developed tests that help
employees.

537
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,240
Employers decide who might be competent,
more competent than who,

538
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:52,330
when they're hiring,
and that's partly dependent on general

539
00:31:52,331 --> 00:31:56,530
cognitive ability and we think based on
the statistics,

540
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:00,040
the relevant statistics that we can
improve the probability that a given

541
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:05,041
employee employer will hire an above
average worker in a cognitively complex,

542
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:10,390
um,
for a cognitively complex job position

543
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,800
from 50 slash 50 to 75 slash 25 or 80
slash 20.

544
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,750
It's quite a lot,
but it's not.

545
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:20,470
Obviously there's still a,
there's still a fair margin of error

546
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:21,850
there,
but you know,

547
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:25,600
having half as many employees below
average is definitely going to be of

548
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:29,590
tremendous benefit to your company.
And you might say,

549
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:33,730
well that's unfair because there's going
to be measurement error too.

550
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:34,923
And

551
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,840
that's not the question.
The question is,

552
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,760
it is,
it is more unfair than to do it any

553
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:42,540
other way.
Well,

554
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:44,690
you could use interviews,
but tall,

555
00:32:44,691 --> 00:32:47,210
good looking.
Extroverted people tend to do much

556
00:32:47,211 --> 00:32:49,550
better on interviews than short,
ugly,

557
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:52,070
introverted people,
especially if they're a little bit on

558
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:55,220
the disagreeable side as well because
agreeable people also do better in

559
00:32:55,221 --> 00:32:58,790
interviews.
So not only are they tremendously biased

560
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:01,730
in all of those dimensions,
they actually don't predict performance

561
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:05,600
in the long run very well at all.
So actually that means in the states

562
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:06,920
they are illegal,
you know,

563
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,010
although companies,
lawyers haven't woken up to this fact

564
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:12,830
yet,
but you're mandated by law in the United

565
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:16,700
States to use the most accurate,
valid and reliable current means of

566
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:21,200
hiring available and interviews are not
that and neither are letters of

567
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:23,270
recommendation which are pretty much as
bad.

568
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,270
They're not so much bias that letters of
recommendation,

569
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:30,860
they're just useless because you know,
except in so far as if you can't get

570
00:33:30,861 --> 00:33:33,740
anyone to write you a letter of
recommendation at all,

571
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,710
well maybe that's an indication that
you're very,

572
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,650
you're not very socially skilled or that
you don't have a very good social

573
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:40,700
network or whatever.

574
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:45,050
So maybe as a really blunt indicator of
isolation,

575
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,560
you could derive some information out of
letters of recommendation.

576
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:51,740
But as far as valid indicators of future
performance,

577
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,040
they're just not valid at all.
It's partly why I hate writing them.

578
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,430
It's they're,
they're,

579
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,850
they're,
they're also illegal.

580
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:01,940
At least they are in the us,
even though people don't understand that

581
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:03,830
yet,
but I know the law and I know the

582
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:05,240
validity statistics,
so,

583
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,120
um,
and what you're required to do.

584
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,050
So then you might also ask,
um,

585
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:16,490
so the,
so the other selection methods are also

586
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:18,980
biased and unreliable.
You could say,

587
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:20,510
well,
you could hire someone based on their

588
00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:23,330
academic history,
but roughly that's an index of

589
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:25,430
intelligence and conscientiousness
anyways,

590
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:28,640
it's just not a very good one,
especially because there's tremendous

591
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:32,200
variability between schools.
So if you have a,

592
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,030
you know,
a GPA of four point zero from school x

593
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:38,210
and this person has a gpa of four point
zero from school.

594
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:40,370
Why?
There's no reason at all to assume that

595
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:43,490
those are comparable.
So you can use grades,

596
00:34:43,491 --> 00:34:46,400
but that's full of measurement error.
So that's not very good either.

597
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:51,880
So you could guess that it'll give you a
50 slash 50 in terms of your probability

598
00:34:54,711 --> 00:34:57,800
of hiring someone who is above average
versus below average.

599
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,993
But,
um,

600
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,270
that doesn't seem to be a very
intelligent way of going about it either

601
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:02,900
because.

602
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,670
And here's,
here's something to think about.

603
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:10,940
So
let's assume that there are 10 people

604
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:13,010
working and,
uh,

605
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:18,130
inappropriate selection method places an
incompetent manager above them.

606
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,400
So maybe the manager is less intelligent
than the workers.

607
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:27,401
That might be one possibility or maybe
the managers less creative than the

608
00:35:27,651 --> 00:35:30,320
workers are.
Maybe the manager is less conscientious

609
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:32,090
or whatever.
It doesn't matter.

610
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:36,710
Some dimension of competence is not well
matched with the demands of the job.

611
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,860
Well then one of the questions is what
exactly are you doing to the manager

612
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,920
while you're basically setting them up
to fail?

613
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,640
And the tremendous number of managers
fail in the first two years of their,

614
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,060
of their promotion.
It's,

615
00:35:49,061 --> 00:35:53,430
it's well above 50 percent and so that's
not so good for them.

616
00:35:53,431 --> 00:35:57,870
But then you're also doing the 10 people
that they're supervising to a kind of

617
00:35:57,871 --> 00:36:02,010
horrible pr,
no perdition for the time it takes for

618
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:04,650
everyone to calculate that the manager
is actually failing.

619
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:08,460
And what that means generally is that
the very highly qualified people in the

620
00:36:08,461 --> 00:36:10,470
work approval,
we'll just leave because why would they

621
00:36:10,471 --> 00:36:12,720
put up with that?
So then you might think,

622
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:15,240
well,
is it unethical to select properly or is

623
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:19,320
it ethical to select randomly or exactly
how should you solve that problem?

624
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,180
And the answer is,
well,

625
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:23,580
we do try to solve it because we use
selection methods,

626
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,770
but we usually use ones that aren't very
accurate.

627
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,480
It's funny too because I tried selling
accurate selection tests to corporations

628
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:34,230
for a very long period of time and one
of the things I learned is they didn't

629
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:37,770
want them.
That was mind boggling to me because the

630
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:41,460
economic utility and hiring people who
are competent compared to people who

631
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:44,490
aren't so high,
it's absolutely mind boggling because

632
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:47,730
the difference in productivity between
people isn't even.

633
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,550
It isn't normally distributed.

634
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,860
It's Prieto distributed.
Some people are staggeringly more

635
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:57,861
productive than other people.
So tilting your selection criteria so

636
00:36:58,051 --> 00:37:02,760
that you pick from the more productive
end of the distribution means incredibly

637
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,580
powerful economic benefits for your
company.

638
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,900
But
at least when I was doing this to begin

639
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:12,330
with human resources,
people who are usually the ones

640
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:16,350
evaluating the tests weren't necessarily
the most competent people in the

641
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:18,720
corporate environment.
Which is something that hasn't changed

642
00:37:18,721 --> 00:37:21,510
very much.
They were very badly trained and they

643
00:37:21,511 --> 00:37:24,150
believed that there were no differences
between people that couldn't be

644
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:26,250
eliminated with training,
which is like,

645
00:37:26,251 --> 00:37:27,150
yeah,
no,

646
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,730
no,
that's wrong as anybody,

647
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:33,210
if you have any sense at all and you
think about it for 15 or 20 seconds,

648
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,740
you know,
that's the case.

649
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,600
You know,
I don't know what it was like in your

650
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:38,100
school,
but in the school I went to,

651
00:37:38,101 --> 00:37:41,550
which was way the hell up in northern
Alberta in the middle of no man's land,

652
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,210
you know,
there was at least 15 percent of the

653
00:37:45,211 --> 00:37:47,640
students,
I would say it was probably higher who

654
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:50,640
are still functionally illiterate by the
time they hit grade 10.

655
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,170
Functional illiteracy being they had
never read an entire book.

656
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,810
And that's way more common than you
think.

657
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,520
Like,
I don't know how common you think that

658
00:37:59,521 --> 00:38:02,480
is,
but the stats basically indicate there's

659
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:07,490
as many people with Iqs of 85 and lower
as there are people with Iqs of 115 and

660
00:38:07,831 --> 00:38:09,600
higher.
So.

661
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:14,250
And I already said that the minimum Iq
level of anybody in this room is likely

662
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:19,251
to be something around 115.
So the person in this room who has the

663
00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:23,490
lowest general cognitive ability is
smarter than 85 percent of the general

664
00:38:23,491 --> 00:38:28,470
population at 85 and lower,
which is there's just as many people

665
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:33,471
there as there is at 115 and higher at
85 and lower then you don't get

666
00:38:33,481 --> 00:38:38,481
literacy.
So people with Iqs of 90 or less have a

667
00:38:38,931 --> 00:38:43,931
difficult time translating written words
into action so they can't really read

668
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:47,300
instructions.
So.

669
00:38:47,301 --> 00:38:48,134
And that's like

670
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:53,200
10 percent of the population is 15
percent of the population,

671
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:56,650
actually 15 percent of the population.
And it's.

672
00:38:56,651 --> 00:39:00,100
So you might say,
well no way.

673
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:02,500
It's like,
well you don't get to have an opinion on

674
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:04,600
this by the way,
because the science has already been

675
00:39:04,601 --> 00:39:06,460
done.
But I can tell you one fact that's

676
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:10,090
pretty unsettling.
So the United States army has been doing

677
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:14,590
Iq testing on its recruits for since
before World War One.

678
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:19,180
They actually did a lot of the research
that established Iq tests and validated

679
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,100
them.
And indicated that they were reliable

680
00:39:21,101 --> 00:39:23,320
and so forth,
and that a variety of reasons for doing

681
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:24,350
that,
um,

682
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,450
partly I guess they didn't want to put
in competent people in charge of deadly

683
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:31,030
machinery,
which does seem to be a reasonable

684
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,410
proposition,
I would say.

685
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,430
But what they found as a consequence of
their hundreds,

686
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,640
100 years of testing was that you
couldn't teach anybody with an Iq of 83

687
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:47,821
or lower anything at all that would make
them anything but an obstacle to the,

688
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,300
um,
tasks that the armed forces had to

689
00:39:52,301 --> 00:39:55,540
complete on a regular basis.
So that's 83.

690
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:58,930
So now in the United States,
it's actually illegal to induct anyone

691
00:39:58,931 --> 00:40:01,630
into the armed forces if they have an Iq
of 83 or lower.

692
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:04,480
And that's more than 10 percent of the
population.

693
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:09,990
Now you got to think about that because
what it means is that approximately 10

694
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:13,330
percent of the population is
sufficiently,

695
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,073
um,

696
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:21,230
has sufficiently low general cognitive
ability that

697
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,800
one of the

698
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,880
complex enterprises that's chronically
most desperate for manpower has decided

699
00:40:31,091 --> 00:40:36,091
that there no point in even trying.
Now that's a dismal outcome.

700
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:41,140
But I don't know exactly what you're
supposed to do with that fact,

701
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:44,320
but ignoring it doesn't seem to me to be
the right thing because it doesn't solve

702
00:40:44,321 --> 00:40:48,130
the problem and this is going to become
an increasingly and increasingly

703
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:54,630
present and and,
and unavoidable and ignorable problem.

704
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:00,460
Because you know already,
that's what's happening in developed

705
00:41:00,461 --> 00:41:02,680
countries.
Less so in underdeveloped countries,

706
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:06,940
but in developed countries,
the gap between the rich and the poor is

707
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,350
increasing.
So for,

708
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:13,600
for example,
almost all of the increases in wealth

709
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,470
that have accrued to people in the last
20 years have accrued to people who are

710
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:20,050
in the top one percent of the
distribution of wealth.

711
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:25,030
And that's not going to stop by the way.
And part of the reason is,

712
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:29,920
is that cognitive power has become even
more valuable than it was four years

713
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:30,160
ago.

714
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,070
And the reason for that is computers
basically.

715
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:36,710
Because if you're really smart and
you're good with a computer,

716
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:40,370
you're way ahead of someone who isn't
very smart and who doesn't know how to

717
00:41:40,371 --> 00:41:43,430
use computers at all and you're not just
a little bit ahead.

718
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,850
You're leaps and bounds ahead and worse
than that,

719
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:49,910
you're getting farther ahead all the
time and the reason for that is that

720
00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:53,330
computational power keeps increasing and
it increases a lot.

721
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:58,310
It's doubling about every 18 months,
so part of the problem that the human

722
00:41:58,311 --> 00:42:02,540
race is going to have to face in the
next 30 years along with many other

723
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:07,280
problems is what are you going to do
with people who have neither the

724
00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:12,020
cognitive ability,
nor the conscientiousness to find a

725
00:42:12,021 --> 00:42:17,021
niche in society that's actually that,
that other people will value enough to

726
00:42:18,341 --> 00:42:20,500
pay for.
Because that's really the question.

727
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,570
What do you do?
Well,

728
00:42:22,571 --> 00:42:25,300
the conservative answer to that as well,
there's a job for everyone.

729
00:42:25,301 --> 00:42:26,260
It's like,
no,

730
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,510
that's wrong.
There isn't.

731
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:31,030
And the liberal answer is well,
everybody's the same,

732
00:42:31,031 --> 00:42:33,760
so it's just a matter of training and
that's also wrong.

733
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,700
They're both.
Both of those positions are there.

734
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:40,090
The scientific research has rented them
permanently outdated.

735
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,280
Well,
you know,

736
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:52,910
there is the possibility of providing a
minimum income.

737
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,793
The,
the,

738
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:58,580
the question,
what will that do is completely

739
00:42:58,581 --> 00:43:00,860
unanswerable.
We have no idea what it'll do.

740
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,370
You know what I mean?
It might start people from,

741
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,940
from starving to death,
although the,

742
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:09,350
I wouldn't say in North America,
that's generally not a problem people

743
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:13,250
have anyways,
but we don't know.

744
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,170
See,
I think of,

745
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,480
I think of human beings as pack animals
fundamentally.

746
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,070
You know,
on I and I,

747
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:19,973
this is just,

748
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:25,050
it's a metaphor in some sense.
I don't think that people can be happy

749
00:43:25,051 --> 00:43:27,390
and less.
They are burdened down with something

750
00:43:27,391 --> 00:43:30,450
like a sled dog is burdened down with
something you know,

751
00:43:30,451 --> 00:43:33,170
you,
you have to have a responsibilities,

752
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,250
they have to be important
responsibilities.

753
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:38,520
You have to be sequenced in your time.
You know,

754
00:43:38,521 --> 00:43:40,980
most of the people I have in my clinical
practice,

755
00:43:40,981 --> 00:43:43,800
if they're not employed,
they just fall apart and the

756
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:47,710
conscientious ones fall apart because
they eat themselves up with shame and

757
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:52,830
guilt and the unconscientious ones fall
apart because their sleep schedule goes

758
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:54,810
all over the place.
They don't eat regularly,

759
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,080
regularly anymore.
They do all sorts of impulsive things

760
00:43:58,081 --> 00:44:02,820
that are counterproductive and you know,
they just sort of spiral into a pool of

761
00:44:02,821 --> 00:44:07,320
meaninglessness.
So human beings are pretty social and

762
00:44:07,321 --> 00:44:09,000
we're pretty altruistic,
you know,

763
00:44:09,001 --> 00:44:10,500
in,
in some weird manner,

764
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,870
and it,
it doesn't seem to me that people can

765
00:44:12,871 --> 00:44:14,010
live a life that's

766
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:20,840
acceptable if all they have is enforced
leisure.

767
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:25,970
So maybe that'll be wrong if you
provided people with a base salary,

768
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,240
maybe people would figure out what to do
with their spare time.

769
00:44:29,241 --> 00:44:30,280
But,
um,

770
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,520
I doubt it.
I don't think people are.

771
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:38,640
I think it's very,
very difficult for people to regulate

772
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:41,460
themselves in the absence of a certain
minimum of,

773
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,940
of social structuring and guidance.
I've seen very,

774
00:44:44,941 --> 00:44:49,941
very few people who can conjure that up
on their own and manage it for extensive

775
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,490
periods of time.
I think I've only met one person,

776
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:55,920
I would say in my whole life,
who's actually managed that.

777
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:01,490
And that particular person has a very
large array of talents and is extremely

778
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:03,630
intelligent.
So.

779
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:11,630
All right,
so you might ask,

780
00:45:21,081 --> 00:45:21,914
well,
what,

781
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:25,460
what,
what exactly is intelligence?

782
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:28,310
Maybe what exactly is the ability to
abstract,

783
00:45:28,311 --> 00:45:33,311
and I think it's something like this.
The world is made out of

784
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,540
the world is a very,
very high resolution place.

785
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:44,190
No matter how much you zoom into
something,

786
00:45:44,191 --> 00:45:47,940
you can zoom in more.
There's information that more and more

787
00:45:47,941 --> 00:45:52,170
and more and more levels of detail and
then also no matter how far you back

788
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,290
away from something,
there's more and more and more levels of

789
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:58,800
detail.
So you know you guys are composed of a

790
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:02,700
whole variety of sub systems,
complex functioning subsystems all the

791
00:46:02,701 --> 00:46:07,350
way down to the subatomic level and then
above your phenomenal logical level of

792
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:09,860
perception.
You're members of families,

793
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:14,010
members of cities.
You're members of provinces and and

794
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:19,340
nationalities and international
organizations and ecological structures

795
00:46:20,101 --> 00:46:25,101
and so forth and so on and all of that's
characteristic of you all the time and

796
00:46:26,491 --> 00:46:29,010
in every situation,
but you don't deal with all that

797
00:46:29,011 --> 00:46:32,610
information and you can't.
And so one of the things that people

798
00:46:32,611 --> 00:46:35,400
seem to have learned how to do is to
abstract from that.

799
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,490
And I'm not exactly sure what it means
to abstract,

800
00:46:38,491 --> 00:46:43,130
but it seems to me that it means
something that's similar to producing a

801
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,810
low resolution representations.
Like a thumbnail.

802
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,120
And so actually when I look at each of
you,

803
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,570
what I'm actually seeing is a thumbnail
of what you are.

804
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:53,160
No,
first of all,

805
00:46:53,161 --> 00:46:56,100
obviously I don't see the other side of
you that or,

806
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:58,540
or either side for that matter.
I only see you face,

807
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:00,810
so on.
So in some sense it's a two dimensional,

808
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:02,280
um,
thumbnail.

809
00:47:02,281 --> 00:47:06,390
And then I have no idea what's going on
in the subsystems that,

810
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,140
that constitute you at levels outside,
you know,

811
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:14,310
underneath your mirror surface.
That's a complex diagnostic problem.

812
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:15,930
For example,
if there was something wrong with you

813
00:47:15,931 --> 00:47:20,931
and I can't see your families are except
in very low resolution ways,

814
00:47:21,481 --> 00:47:26,430
your nationality or any of the systems
that you're identified with an embedded

815
00:47:26,431 --> 00:47:27,264
in.

816
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:30,580
So just looking at you as an act of
abstraction,

817
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:33,910
you know,
and part of that thankfully is done by

818
00:47:33,911 --> 00:47:36,550
the fact that our sensory systems just
aren't that good.

819
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,160
So there's a whole bunch of things we
can't perceive.

820
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:44,080
And that simplifies the problem.
Now what we're hoping is that I can

821
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:49,120
perceive enough of you at a given time
so that if I interact with you,

822
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,760
I get what I want.
And you get what you want,

823
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:53,860
roughly speaking,
it's something like that.

824
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:58,720
So what we hope is the model,
the abstract model even of perception

825
00:47:58,721 --> 00:48:03,010
itself is sufficiently accurate so that
it's sufficiently,

826
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:07,420
it's a sufficiently unbiased sample of
the reality that it reflects so that if

827
00:48:07,421 --> 00:48:09,820
I interact with it,
things work out the way that I would

828
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:12,610
like them to work out.
But there's lots of times when that

829
00:48:12,611 --> 00:48:14,220
doesn't happen at all,
right?

830
00:48:14,221 --> 00:48:15,850
It doesn't happen when you're sick.

831
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:20,620
The fact is that you're.
The resolution of your sensory apparatus

832
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:23,800
is a huge impediment to figuring out why
you might be ill,

833
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:25,900
you know,
and it doesn't help much either when

834
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:29,680
people are engaged in struggles that go
beyond the merely personal.

835
00:48:29,681 --> 00:48:33,100
So if we happen to be,
if I happened to be the member of one

836
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:36,670
ethnic group and you happened to be the
member of another and there is strife

837
00:48:36,671 --> 00:48:40,450
between those two ethnic groups than the
fact that I can perceive you at this

838
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:43,900
level of resolution might have very
little to do with my ability to solve

839
00:48:43,901 --> 00:48:48,901
that particular problem.
Now obviously people can obstruct and

840
00:48:49,021 --> 00:48:51,280
you know,
part of that's just built into us so

841
00:48:51,281 --> 00:48:53,530
that we abstract the phenomena that we
see,

842
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:57,550
but then human beings,
I think in some sense are capable of

843
00:48:57,551 --> 00:49:00,460
metta abstraction.
So I think what happens is you can

844
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:03,580
imagine that there's the phenomenon in
and of itself,

845
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,460
whatever that is,
that complicated multilayered thing

846
00:49:06,461 --> 00:49:09,880
that's always in front of you and then
there's your representation of it,

847
00:49:09,881 --> 00:49:14,881
which is what you perceive which is
already extracted to a tremendous degree

848
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:16,870
and limited to a tremendous degree.

849
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:21,390
And then there's abstractions of that.
So what seemed,

850
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,400
what it seems to me to be the is that
language is a thumbnail of images that

851
00:49:27,191 --> 00:49:29,530
are a thumbnail of the reality of
things.

852
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,350
It's something like that.
So it's a dual compression.

853
00:49:32,351 --> 00:49:36,130
So if I say to you,
you'll what,

854
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:40,300
what the word cat does for you is
produced the image of a generic cat,

855
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:44,410
which is already a kind of abstraction.
And then that's attached to your

856
00:49:44,411 --> 00:49:46,900
understanding in some sense so that you
can.

857
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:52,150
You can generate the understanding that
would go along with at least in part

858
00:49:52,151 --> 00:49:54,730
with perceiving or interacting with a
real cat,

859
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:59,530
so in some sense what you're doing is
I'm compressing the information down to

860
00:49:59,531 --> 00:50:04,531
a tremendous Lee.
I'm a low resolution thumbnail and I'm

861
00:50:05,591 --> 00:50:09,160
throwing that at you and you decompress
it into a low resolution image and then

862
00:50:09,161 --> 00:50:12,640
you decompress that into something
that's roughly equivalent to reality.

863
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:15,460
That's what you're doing when you're
reading a book,

864
00:50:15,461 --> 00:50:16,330
for example.
Right?

865
00:50:16,331 --> 00:50:19,540
Because when you read the book,
you can conjure up images of the places

866
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:22,870
that the author is talking about.
You conjure up images of the characters

867
00:50:22,871 --> 00:50:27,320
themselves,
so to such a degree that if you go see a

868
00:50:27,321 --> 00:50:30,320
movie that's made of your favorite book,
you might be irritated because of the

869
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:33,170
person in the movie looks nothing like
the person that you read about,

870
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,240
at least as far as your imagination was
concerned.

871
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:40,780
Now intelligence in general seems to be
whatever underlies the ability to

872
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:45,791
generate those low resolution
representations to and to utilize them,

873
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:49,070
so that would mean to manipulate them in
your own mind,

874
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:54,530
but also to communicate them to others.
A big part of intelligence is working

875
00:50:54,531 --> 00:50:59,270
memory and working memory is well,
while you're sitting there thinking

876
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,470
if you're thinking,
how many of you think in words primarily

877
00:51:03,471 --> 00:51:08,060
as far as you're concerned.
So how many of you don't

878
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,450
thinking images?
Anybody?

879
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,553
Images?

880
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:16,430
Uh,

881
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:24,070
well that's another possibility.
How many of you think in words and

882
00:51:24,071 --> 00:51:25,750
images?
Okay.

883
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,613
Okay.
So,

884
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:27,611
so,
okay,

885
00:51:27,611 --> 00:51:28,600
well that's fine.
You know,

886
00:51:28,601 --> 00:51:32,020
the images are already a representation
and in many ways the words are a

887
00:51:32,021 --> 00:51:36,460
representation of the images.
And so your ability to abstract and then

888
00:51:36,461 --> 00:51:39,700
your ability to manipulate those
abstractions seems to be at the core of

889
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:43,240
whatever intelligence is.
And that's what Iq purports to measure.

890
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:46,030
Um,
your working memory.

891
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:49,840
So when you're,
if you sit there right now,

892
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,280
um,
so let's do this.

893
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:53,860
Here's the sentence to think about.
Okay?

894
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:56,800
Now think about that sentence.
Okay?

895
00:51:56,801 --> 00:52:01,801
So the faculty that you're using to
represent that sentence to yourself is

896
00:52:04,571 --> 00:52:07,900
working memory and it's not very
powerful.

897
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,360
You can't contain very much in your
working memory.

898
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,010
Seven digits is about the maximum.
Now people vary.

899
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:18,670
Some people think that four bits of
information is actually the limit to

900
00:52:18,671 --> 00:52:19,300
working memory.

901
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,150
Some people think it's closer to seven,
but it's not very much.

902
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:25,090
That's why telephone numbers tend to be
seven digits long,

903
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,670
so you can kind of easily remember seven
things,

904
00:52:27,671 --> 00:52:30,250
which is not very many things,
you know,

905
00:52:30,251 --> 00:52:34,180
so part of what your intelligence is,
the breadth of that working memory and

906
00:52:34,181 --> 00:52:37,900
then the speed with which you can run
abstractions through it.

907
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:42,730
So now you know,
I've put a little map here up.

908
00:52:42,731 --> 00:52:46,450
So the thing on the top left,
well that's sort of a multidimensional.

909
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:49,800
It's a scheme of a multidimensional
reality and I,

910
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,610
you know,
if you look at that,

911
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:54,760
what it is,
it's a collection of dots or circles

912
00:52:54,761 --> 00:52:56,830
arrayed in a variety of different
arrays.

913
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:01,840
My proposition is that you can represent
that array in a variety of different

914
00:53:01,841 --> 00:53:03,670
ways.
I've called them object one.

915
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:08,410
You can't see object to slide error
object three d object for an object

916
00:53:08,411 --> 00:53:08,710
five.

917
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:11,860
Those are all low resolution
representations of the thing that's in

918
00:53:11,861 --> 00:53:15,610
the top left hand corner.
And you can see that in some sense they

919
00:53:15,611 --> 00:53:20,611
capture something important,
they capture some important element of

920
00:53:21,041 --> 00:53:23,710
the thing in the top left hand corner,
but they don't capture all of it.

921
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:26,220
Now,
it might be that capturing all of it is

922
00:53:26,221 --> 00:53:29,340
a good idea because you don't want to
use any more information than you have

923
00:53:29,341 --> 00:53:31,110
to.
And then at the bottom,

924
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:34,980
well those are words or semantic symbols
of one form or another.

925
00:53:34,981 --> 00:53:38,530
And they represent the representations.
Um,

926
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:44,820
I saw temple grandin speak once,
I don't remember if I told you about

927
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:47,010
this,
but she's a very famous autistic

928
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:48,720
researcher.
Um,

929
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,110
and she's quite autistic and she's very
fun to listen to.

930
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,270
Um,
she's quite a good public speaker,

931
00:53:54,271 --> 00:53:56,350
which is quite remarkable.
Um,

932
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:59,840
she's trying to figure out,
she thinks that autistic people think

933
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:04,710
like animals and,
and she actually works with animals and

934
00:54:04,711 --> 00:54:06,570
she seems to be very good at
understanding them.

935
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,820
Uh,
she believes that what things that

936
00:54:08,821 --> 00:54:11,850
frightened her are the same thing that
frightens animals and for the same

937
00:54:11,851 --> 00:54:14,580
reasons.
And so her proposition for example,

938
00:54:14,581 --> 00:54:19,581
is that if I say the word church,
all of you people are going to have what

939
00:54:21,631 --> 00:54:25,560
you might describe as a schematic,
abstraction like a hero glyphs that's

940
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:28,590
more or less representative of the class
of churches and so.

941
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:31,500
Or maybe I can say house kids are good
at this.

942
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:35,190
You see this house.
It's like it's got a little rectangle on

943
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:37,740
the top and it's got a kind of a square
on the bottom.

944
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:40,860
It's got a door and two windows and the
windows have crosses in them and there's

945
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:42,960
always a chimney on the top with smoke
coming out.

946
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:46,530
Which I think is quite remarkable
because you actually don't see that many

947
00:54:46,531 --> 00:54:48,570
houses now that have chimneys with smoke
coming out.

948
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:53,570
But still that's the canonical image for
a child temple grandin's claim was that

949
00:54:55,350 --> 00:55:00,350
she cannot see house.
She can only see a house.

950
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:04,680
And so if you say to her something like
house than what comes to mind is a

951
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:07,140
particular house that she's actually
experienced.

952
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,980
She can't take the next level of
abstraction past that,

953
00:55:10,981 --> 00:55:15,000
which seems to be something like a
deficit in generating like a hero

954
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:17,700
glyphic image.
One of the ways to think about

955
00:55:17,701 --> 00:55:19,650
children's drawings.
You know how they draw people with

956
00:55:19,651 --> 00:55:21,000
sticks and circles.
You know,

957
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:21,391
you think,
oh,

958
00:55:21,391 --> 00:55:22,620
that's so primitive.
It's like,

959
00:55:22,621 --> 00:55:23,221
no,
it's not.

960
00:55:23,221 --> 00:55:26,190
It's unbelievably sophisticated because
those aren't pictures.

961
00:55:26,191 --> 00:55:30,150
They're here glyphic and the child
automatically produces them and that's a

962
00:55:30,151 --> 00:55:34,890
protocol linguistic development.
So some autistic kids can draw like

963
00:55:34,891 --> 00:55:38,550
Leonardo Davinci with no training
whatsoever and that's partly because

964
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:41,880
they don't use here glyphic and that
means that they don't really

965
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:45,480
conceptualize the thing they're looking
at as an abstraction.

966
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,560
They see nothing but detail and if
you're training yourself to be a visual

967
00:55:49,561 --> 00:55:51,540
artists,
you have to stop looking at the

968
00:55:51,541 --> 00:55:55,050
abstraction and you have to start
looking at the thing and that's very

969
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:57,810
unsettling.
So if you take your hand for example,

970
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:02,010
and you look at it and you snap it out
of hand representation,

971
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,770
when you do that property,
it all of a sudden it looks like some

972
00:56:04,771 --> 00:56:08,970
kind of like octopus claw.
It's very bizarre looking thing and as

973
00:56:08,971 --> 00:56:10,860
soon as you see it that way you can draw
it,

974
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:13,260
but as long as you're seeing it like a
hand,

975
00:56:13,261 --> 00:56:14,160
you're going to put,
you know,

976
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:16,380
a,
a balloon with four balloons on it or

977
00:56:16,381 --> 00:56:18,390
something like that.
And that's going to be the hand.

978
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:20,730
So,
all right.

979
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:33,430
This guy's name is John Carol.
Carol's a real scientist.

980
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,680
Um,
he looked at

981
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:40,860
the structure of Iq for a very long
period of time,

982
00:56:40,861 --> 00:56:43,200
wrote a very thick book on it,
um,

983
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:47,910
which nobody likes to read because it's
almost entirely technical.

984
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:51,480
So it's really more of a reference book.
But what,

985
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,750
what Carol hypothesized and I think his
hypothesis is as close to state of the

986
00:56:57,751 --> 00:56:59,490
arc as,
as any,

987
00:56:59,491 --> 00:57:03,540
is that
there is a stratum three level which is

988
00:57:03,541 --> 00:57:04,620
fluid intelligence

989
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,633
g,

990
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:11,390
and it's the main factor that unites all
these other tests.

991
00:57:11,391 --> 00:57:13,940
And then net stratum one,
you get fluid intelligence,

992
00:57:13,941 --> 00:57:16,550
crystallized intelligence,
verbal intelligence.

993
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:18,680
I don't remember what the rest of them
stand for.

994
00:57:18,681 --> 00:57:23,420
And then each of those can be subdivided
into specific tests in each of the tests

995
00:57:23,421 --> 00:57:28,421
can be subdivided into somewhat
particularized individual cognitive

996
00:57:29,601 --> 00:57:33,950
abilities.
Now they're not that individual because

997
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,650
there's a single factor that accounts
for most of the variability in the

998
00:57:36,651 --> 00:57:37,484
performance.

999
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:38,683
So

1000
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,760
in a sense,
what this theory says is that the

1001
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:48,230
intelligence is sum up to one
intelligence and that seems to be

1002
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:50,180
essentially correct

1003
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,840
this,
although you can't see it very well,

1004
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,440
if you look at ge,
they're on the left,

1005
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,890
the lines leading to the first or the.
I think that's the second strategy,

1006
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:08,460
the next strata anyways,
show you the correlation between Ge and

1007
00:58:08,461 --> 00:58:12,120
each of the individual intelligence is.
And what you see is the correlation

1008
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:15,840
between Ge and fluid intelligence is
point nine four,

1009
00:58:15,841 --> 00:58:18,660
which is such a tight correlation that
it might as well just be the thing

1010
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:23,661
itself between
Ge and crystallized intelligence is

1011
00:58:24,451 --> 00:58:28,320
point eight,
five m all of the first order

1012
00:58:28,321 --> 00:58:31,620
correlations there above point eight.
That's exactly.

1013
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:36,210
And then at the far right,
you get concepts that you might think

1014
00:58:36,211 --> 00:58:41,010
about as particularized.
And so those include concept formation,

1015
00:58:41,011 --> 00:58:44,340
analysis and synthesis number,
series number matrices,

1016
00:58:44,341 --> 00:58:46,590
spatial relations,
picture recognition,

1017
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,750
block rotation,
visual matching,

1018
00:58:48,751 --> 00:58:50,990
decision speed,
um,

1019
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:56,310
block rotation,
cross out visual and auditory learning,

1020
00:58:56,311 --> 00:58:58,050
memory for names,
sound blending,

1021
00:58:58,051 --> 00:59:00,720
incomplete word that would be incomplete
word completion,

1022
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,570
sound patterns,
auditory attention,

1023
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:04,530
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1024
00:59:04,531 --> 00:59:08,190
And you can think of those each as
individual tests in that you could make

1025
00:59:08,191 --> 00:59:11,610
a test that theoretically only
individually assessed that thing,

1026
00:59:11,611 --> 00:59:15,540
but you couldn't help but be testing all
sorts of other things at the same time

1027
00:59:15,541 --> 00:59:17,520
because they're not actually
individually.

1028
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:22,200
One of the things you will learn
is that

1029
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:28,660
there are neuro psychological tests and
the neuro psychologists like to think

1030
00:59:28,661 --> 00:59:32,680
that Iq is something that's primitive
and that they've already,

1031
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:36,040
um,
what would you say advanced past.

1032
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:37,900
And so they have specific

1033
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:44,280
prefrontal tests say that hypothetically
assess specific prefrontal abilities.

1034
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:48,670
And then they'll note that if you take a
single test of prefrontal ability and

1035
00:59:48,671 --> 00:59:51,340
correlated with Iq,
it'll only correlated about point three

1036
00:59:51,341 --> 00:59:54,040
or point four.
And then they'll assume because it only

1037
00:59:54,041 --> 00:59:57,700
correlates that low,
that it's measuring something other than

1038
00:59:57,701 --> 01:00:01,030
what Iq is measuring.
But really what happens is that it's

1039
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:04,750
just not a very good Iq test and the
reason that the correlation is so low is

1040
01:00:04,751 --> 01:00:08,410
because of measurement error.
So if you gave the same test to the same

1041
01:00:08,411 --> 01:00:13,270
person 20 times and then you varied the
tasks so that were 30 variants of it and

1042
01:00:13,271 --> 01:00:15,790
you gave those all to the same person 20
times,

1043
01:00:15,791 --> 01:00:19,000
then what would come out would be a
score that would be much more highly

1044
01:00:19,001 --> 01:00:22,630
correlated with Iq and probably
indistinguishable from it.

1045
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,200
And so you'll learn from
neuropsychologists that there's such a

1046
01:00:26,201 --> 01:00:30,400
thing as prefrontal ability and that's
associated with executive control and

1047
01:00:30,401 --> 01:00:34,000
that's associated with self regulation
which would be control over your

1048
01:00:34,001 --> 01:00:34,750
impulses.

1049
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:37,510
And as far as I can tell,
that's all completely wrong.

1050
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:41,380
And it took me like 10 years to figure
that out because I was taught that it

1051
01:00:41,381 --> 01:00:46,381
was right and it wasn't until I plow
through it painfully and understood that

1052
01:00:47,111 --> 01:00:49,750
there was no evidence for that.
So I can tell you how that works.

1053
01:00:49,751 --> 01:00:52,690
So for example,
we gave a neuro psych battery that

1054
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,410
consisted of Dorsolateral prefrontal
test to 3000 people.

1055
01:00:56,411 --> 01:01:00,490
It was a 90 minute battery,
so it was exhaustive and when we factor

1056
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,560
analyzed it,
when there was only about 200

1057
01:01:02,561 --> 01:01:04,600
participants,
we got four factors,

1058
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:08,770
but then when we factor analyzed it
after we had 3000 participants,

1059
01:01:08,771 --> 01:01:13,630
we got two factors and one was one on
which almost all of the tests loaded and

1060
01:01:13,631 --> 01:01:16,750
it was undoubtedly fluid intelligence.
So,

1061
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:18,730
but it's worse than that,
you know,

1062
01:01:18,731 --> 01:01:22,360
because you hear about how the
prefrontal cortex regulates behavior.

1063
01:01:22,361 --> 01:01:23,830
Well,
here's the problem with that.

1064
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,940
What's the correlation between Iq and
conscientiousness?

1065
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:32,290
Zero,
roughly speaking,

1066
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:36,430
it's probably a little off zero,
although it might not be and you know

1067
01:01:36,431 --> 01:01:39,880
that because the dimensions of the big
five or roughly orthogonal I showed you

1068
01:01:39,881 --> 01:01:43,090
at the beginning of this,
that each trait of the big five traits

1069
01:01:43,091 --> 01:01:46,810
is correlated with the other trade on an
average of about point two.

1070
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:50,220
Now why that is,
it's probably because of something like,

1071
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:52,573
um,

1072
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:56,640
what would you call?
It's probably a halo effect.

1073
01:01:56,641 --> 01:02:00,030
If you tend to rate yourself as positive
on one trait,

1074
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,040
more conscientious,
more agreeable,

1075
01:02:02,041 --> 01:02:05,400
more emotionally stable,
you're going to tend to rate yourself as

1076
01:02:05,401 --> 01:02:09,300
more positive on the other traits,
so that would artificially inflate their

1077
01:02:09,301 --> 01:02:12,090
correlation.
That's one way of looking at it anyways.

1078
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:14,400
Weirdly enough,
the correlation between

1079
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:17,040
conscientiousness in ICU is essentially
zero.

1080
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,540
Now,
that's a big problem,

1081
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:21,540
isn't it?
It's unconscientious people that seem to

1082
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:24,210
be behaviorally dysregulated,
right?

1083
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:25,740
They can't stick to a task.
They,

1084
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:27,200
they,
they jump about,

1085
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:28,590
they're,
they're not on track.

1086
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:31,470
They appear impulsive.
Although we don't know how to define

1087
01:02:31,471 --> 01:02:34,110
impulsive by the way,
but your hill psychologists use that all

1088
01:02:34,111 --> 01:02:35,400
the time.
It's like,

1089
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:37,800
well,
if prefrontal ability regulates

1090
01:02:37,801 --> 01:02:39,960
behavior,
how come the correlation between

1091
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:45,600
intelligence and other forms of
executive control are correlated with

1092
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:50,010
conscientiousness at zero?
Right?

1093
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,950
Zero is a very bad number when you're
testing out a hypothesis.

1094
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:55,140
So,
and you know,

1095
01:02:55,141 --> 01:02:57,660
if you think about it,
it has to be that way and the reason it

1096
01:02:57,661 --> 01:03:01,680
has to be that way is this,
so if you're dreaming,

1097
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:03,720
you're going to just lay there and
dream,

1098
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,490
but your eyes are going to move back and
forth.

1099
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,630
Now you might say,
why aren't you running around acting out

1100
01:03:09,631 --> 01:03:12,150
your dreams while you're dreaming?
And the answer to that is there's a

1101
01:03:12,151 --> 01:03:14,910
little switch in your head roughly
speaking,

1102
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:18,330
that shuts off your motor apparatus when
you're dreaming.

1103
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:21,840
And so what happens is you can't run
around and act out all your dreams

1104
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:25,650
because you're paralyzed and sometimes
people wake up in that state.

1105
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,480
It's called sleep paralysis.
They wake up,

1106
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:29,730
they're sort of half awake and they
can't move,

1107
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:33,150
and then they often hallucinate all
sorts of weird things and thinks aliens

1108
01:03:33,151 --> 01:03:36,300
have come and abducted them and various
peculiarities.

1109
01:03:36,301 --> 01:03:40,290
But if you take a cat and you take out
that little switch,

1110
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:41,970
then the cattle run around while it's
dreaming,

1111
01:03:41,971 --> 01:03:45,900
until it runs into something which is
the problem with running around acting

1112
01:03:45,901 --> 01:03:50,901
out your dreams.
So what does that allow one to conclude?

1113
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:56,040
Well,
if you couldn't abstract away from your

1114
01:03:56,041 --> 01:04:00,270
behavior,
you couldn't think right because what

1115
01:04:00,271 --> 01:04:05,271
thinking means is to represent an
alternative world or maybe just a tiny

1116
01:04:06,601 --> 01:04:08,430
little fraction of the world,
whatever,

1117
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,790
to represent it abstractly to manipulate
it around,

1118
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:16,830
but not to simultaneously acted out that
then it wouldn't be abstracting it all.

1119
01:04:16,831 --> 01:04:19,800
It would be fiddling about with the
world through trial and error.

1120
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:23,340
So you have to be able to pull what you
think about out of your body,

1121
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,650
so to speak,
play with it,

1122
01:04:25,651 --> 01:04:29,160
and then implement it back in.
Now it looks maybe like the ability to

1123
01:04:29,161 --> 01:04:32,700
implement a plan is associated with
conscientiousness,

1124
01:04:32,701 --> 01:04:36,060
but we don't understand that that would
be industriousness and we don't know a

1125
01:04:36,061 --> 01:04:39,270
bloody thing about industriousness like
it's just a black hole.

1126
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:43,800
But the idea that it's your ability to
think that allows you to regulate your

1127
01:04:43,801 --> 01:04:45,110
behavior strikes.
Well,

1128
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:47,910
there's no evidence for it.
There's no evidence for it.

1129
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:51,540
Smart people are not necessarily better
at regulating their behavior.

1130
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:57,350
So because for you can have a very
unconscientious smart person and I see

1131
01:04:57,871 --> 01:05:00,180
them in my clinical practice now and
then they come and say,

1132
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,220
well,
I'm really smart and here's the

1133
01:05:02,221 --> 01:05:04,530
evidence,
but I'm doing very badly and everything.

1134
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:07,230
They're under achievers roughly
speaking,

1135
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:10,530
you know,
so they can't implement their thoughts

1136
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,910
not in any stable manner.
So the fact that they're smart

1137
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:21,400
on average across their life,
smart people are healthier mentally and

1138
01:05:21,401 --> 01:05:23,140
physically than people who aren't as
smart.

1139
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:26,650
But the reason for that isn't because
their intelligence allows them to

1140
01:05:26,651 --> 01:05:29,500
regulate their health.
The reason for that is because their

1141
01:05:29,501 --> 01:05:32,920
intelligence allows them roughly
speaking to succeed.

1142
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:35,950
So they're higher up in the dominance
hierarchy and if you're higher up in the

1143
01:05:35,951 --> 01:05:39,070
dominance hierarchy then your life isn't
as stressful and you don't get sick as

1144
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,140
often.
But that doesn't indicate that there's a

1145
01:05:41,141 --> 01:05:43,930
direct control between your intelligence
and your behavioral output.

1146
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,240
There's very little evidence for that.
Well,

1147
01:05:46,241 --> 01:05:49,210
I think there's no evidence for it.
So that's rather shocking.

1148
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,530
So you know,
to me that just wiped out a whole a

1149
01:05:53,531 --> 01:05:58,150
whole substrata of psychological
theorizing and it's,

1150
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:02,440
I'm sure how many of you have come up
against the proposition that prefrontal

1151
01:06:02,441 --> 01:06:04,810
ability was associated with behavioral
control.

1152
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:06,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

1153
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:11,320
Well it isn't.
So you know,

1154
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:12,790
not anymore than I.
First of all,

1155
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:15,650
it's not differentiable from ICU
regardless of what the neuro

1156
01:06:15,651 --> 01:06:18,220
psychologists say,
because they don't know anything about

1157
01:06:18,221 --> 01:06:20,770
psychometrics generally.
And they don't like Icu because if they

1158
01:06:20,771 --> 01:06:23,740
studied Iq then what they'd find is all
the things that they're studying are

1159
01:06:23,741 --> 01:06:27,790
basically variants of Iq and that would
suck because other people have already

1160
01:06:27,791 --> 01:06:32,791
figured out Icu and then there's the big
problem which is well variation in

1161
01:06:33,341 --> 01:06:36,010
prefrontal ability which is equivalent
to variation in Iq,

1162
01:06:36,011 --> 01:06:37,960
isn't correlated with behavioral
control,

1163
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:41,590
is a really big problem.
So.

1164
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:45,040
And so I would like to say,
well what is correlated with behavioral

1165
01:06:45,041 --> 01:06:47,200
control and then.
But the problem with that as well,

1166
01:06:47,201 --> 01:06:49,060
I don't know what you mean by behavioral
control.

1167
01:06:49,061 --> 01:06:50,410
I don't know how you're going to measure
it.

1168
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:52,780
And if you do measure it,
the probability that you're going to

1169
01:06:52,781 --> 01:06:55,300
come up with something like
conscientiousness is pretty much 100

1170
01:06:55,301 --> 01:06:56,920
percent.
So

1171
01:06:58,490 --> 01:06:59,620
all right,

1172
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:06,243
let's see.

1173
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:17,190
Yes,
effect sizes.

1174
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:22,030
This is from a very important paper by a
guy named Hemphill called interpreting

1175
01:07:22,031 --> 01:07:24,820
the magnitudes of correlation
coefficients from the American

1176
01:07:24,821 --> 01:07:28,480
psychologist number 58.
What handheld did was look at all,

1177
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:31,900
he didn't gas it,
how big an effect size had to be for it

1178
01:07:31,901 --> 01:07:34,570
to be a big effect size.
What he did was go into the literature

1179
01:07:34,571 --> 01:07:38,350
and study a whole bunch of papers and
then empirically rank the effect sizes.

1180
01:07:38,351 --> 01:07:41,770
So that would be the standard deviation
difference or the correlation or the r

1181
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:44,860
squared.
You can convert those and then decide

1182
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,110
you know,
what proportion of papers had which

1183
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:50,650
effect size and decide that well,
you could empirically rank them and then

1184
01:07:50,651 --> 01:07:53,560
you'd know how big your effect size was.
And what he found was that

1185
01:07:55,570 --> 01:08:00,570
about three percent of social science
studies showed a correlation Coefficient

1186
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:03,970
of point five or above.
And that's about the correlation between

1187
01:08:03,971 --> 01:08:08,971
Iq and and general life success in
relatively complex conditions.

1188
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:10,840
Point three,
five,

1189
01:08:10,841 --> 01:08:14,980
two point five,
only about one in four papers to one in

1190
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:16,971
point one,
five,

1191
01:08:16,971 --> 01:08:18,020
two point three,
five,

1192
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:23,290
25 to 57 percent of papers and then are
of less than point one five was about a

1193
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:27,770
quarter of papers.
So what that means is the ability of Iq

1194
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:31,580
to predict whatever it is that you want
to predict with it is way the hell up in

1195
01:08:31,581 --> 01:08:33,230
the,
in the rare,

1196
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:34,880
rare,
uh,

1197
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:35,810
what would you call it?

1198
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,270
Well,
it's up in the stratosphere with regards

1199
01:08:40,271 --> 01:08:41,200
to effect power.

1200
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:46,290
Okay.
So what does it mean practically

1201
01:08:46,291 --> 01:08:49,590
speaking?
This is from a company called the

1202
01:08:49,591 --> 01:08:54,450
wonderlic company and the wonderlic
wonderlic sales Iq tests to businesses

1203
01:08:54,451 --> 01:08:57,750
now.
It's actually illegal for businesses to

1204
01:08:57,751 --> 01:09:02,310
use Iq tests in the United States.
So actually it's illegal to do anything

1205
01:09:02,311 --> 01:09:04,620
to hire employees,
employees in the United States as it

1206
01:09:04,621 --> 01:09:07,050
turns out,
because you have to use a test,

1207
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:11,550
you have to use the tasks that's the
most valid and reliable available that

1208
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,890
doesn't produce any ethnic or gender
differences.

1209
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,330
Well,
there's no test like that.

1210
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:16,710
So it's,
it's illegal.

1211
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:18,420
So,
so it's illegal to use,

1212
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:20,940
um,
interviews.

1213
01:09:20,941 --> 01:09:23,310
It's illegal to use letters of
reference,

1214
01:09:23,311 --> 01:09:27,120
it's illegal to usability tests.
You might build to use conscientiousness

1215
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:32,121
tests because conscientiousness tests do
seem to be completely free of

1216
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:38,980
not exactly because older people are
more conscientious than younger people.

1217
01:09:38,981 --> 01:09:41,230
So that's also a problem.
So anyways,

1218
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:42,191
wonder,
lick,

1219
01:09:42,191 --> 01:09:44,170
it's a good company.
It makes really.

1220
01:09:44,190 --> 01:09:49,000
It's Iq tests are genuine tests,
but they are Iq tests and people do use

1221
01:09:49,001 --> 01:09:50,890
them in business even though they're not
supposed to,

1222
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,400
but so,
but what they've done over over a long

1223
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:58,900
period of using the test is to come up
with approximations for different forms

1224
01:09:58,901 --> 01:10:03,190
of employment opportunity.
So how smart do you have to be in order

1225
01:10:03,191 --> 01:10:04,024
to be

1226
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:08,660
placed in a given occupation with a
reasonable probability of success?

1227
01:10:08,661 --> 01:10:10,100
So we,
we can tell you here.

1228
01:10:10,101 --> 01:10:10,934
So,
um,

1229
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:15,380
let's see.
You said exactly the right place.

1230
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:24,590
Okay.
So if you have iqs of 116 to 130,

1231
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:28,310
that's pretty much you guys,
although I suspect there's a fair chunk

1232
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:33,311
of you that have an Iq of over 130 130
makes you 115 makes you 15 percent.

1233
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:38,810
One hundred and 30 makes you a 98
percentile.

1234
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,600
One hundred and 45 makes you 99th
percentile.

1235
01:10:41,601 --> 01:10:46,070
One hundred and 60 makes you 99 point
nine percent or something else to think

1236
01:10:46,071 --> 01:10:50,120
about.
Percentiles are strange things because

1237
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:52,610
you might say,
well there's no difference between

1238
01:10:52,611 --> 01:10:57,320
someone who scores 95th percentile on an
Iq test and 99th percentile because it's

1239
01:10:57,321 --> 01:11:00,590
only four percentile is different.
But that's not for percentages.

1240
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:03,440
The person who scores Ninety five is one
in 20.

1241
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:06,910
The person who scores 99 is one in a
hundred.

1242
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:10,420
The person who scores 99 point nine is
one in a thousand.

1243
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:12,380
So,
and you might think,

1244
01:11:12,381 --> 01:11:14,460
well it doesn't matter because as you
know,

1245
01:11:14,461 --> 01:11:17,760
once you get to a certain degree of
smart that smart enough and now that's

1246
01:11:17,761 --> 01:11:19,290
wrong.
In fact,

1247
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:21,830
it's,
it's probably radically wrong in that

1248
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:26,670
the differences between people actually
increase as you go up the Iq scale.

1249
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:29,970
So,
and that's because performance isn't

1250
01:11:29,971 --> 01:11:33,120
distributed in a normal distribution,
it's distributed in a prieto

1251
01:11:33,121 --> 01:11:37,530
distribution such that almost no one
does anything in a very small number of

1252
01:11:37,531 --> 01:11:39,210
people do everything.
So,

1253
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:42,180
which is also a very dismal fact.
Okay.

1254
01:11:42,181 --> 01:11:46,140
So anyways,
if you're in the upper echelons of the,

1255
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:48,930
of the cognitive distribution,
so

1256
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:57,510
from 116 to 130,
you could be an attorney,

1257
01:11:57,511 --> 01:12:00,360
a research analyst and editor and
advertising manager,

1258
01:12:00,361 --> 01:12:01,680
a chemist,
engineer,

1259
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,780
an executive,
a manager,

1260
01:12:03,781 --> 01:12:08,190
a trade manager trainee,
a systems analyst or an auditory from

1261
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:11,490
115 to 110.
One hundred and 10 to 115.

1262
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:12,593
So that's,

1263
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,430
that'd be in the upper half of a high
school.

1264
01:12:16,431 --> 01:12:18,260
Graduating class,
roughly speaking,

1265
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:24,010
upper quarter copywriter,
account manager slash supervisor,

1266
01:12:24,081 --> 01:12:26,570
sales manager,
sales man,

1267
01:12:26,571 --> 01:12:28,760
programmer analyst,
teacher adjuster,

1268
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:30,710
general manager,
purchasing agent,

1269
01:12:30,711 --> 01:12:33,350
registered nurse sales account,
executive

1270
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:38,030
hundred,
eight to 103 administrative assistant

1271
01:12:38,031 --> 01:12:39,470
store manager,
bookkeeper,

1272
01:12:39,471 --> 01:12:41,240
credit clerk,
drafter designer,

1273
01:12:41,241 --> 01:12:42,890
lab tester,
secretary,

1274
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:44,870
accounting clerk.
Medical debt collection,

1275
01:12:44,871 --> 01:12:47,540
computer operator,
customer service Rep,

1276
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:50,120
automotive salesman,
clerk and typist,

1277
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:53,480
102 to 100.
So that's pretty much right at the mean

1278
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:56,840
dispatcher,
General Office dispatcher,

1279
01:12:56,841 --> 01:12:58,850
police patrol officer,
receptionist,

1280
01:12:58,851 --> 01:13:01,460
cashier,
general clerical work inside sales

1281
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:02,600
clerk,
meter reader,

1282
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,810
printer teller data entry,
or an electrical helper

1283
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:18,170
for ICU from 95 to 98,
machinist quality control Checker,

1284
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:20,000
claims clerk,
driver delivery man,

1285
01:13:20,001 --> 01:13:22,760
security guard,
unskilled labor maintenance machine

1286
01:13:22,761 --> 01:13:24,050
operator,
arc welder,

1287
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:28,370
mechanic,
medical dental assistant from 87 to 93

1288
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:29,780
messenger,
factory,

1289
01:13:29,781 --> 01:13:30,920
production,
Assembler,

1290
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,080
food service worker,
nurses aid,

1291
01:13:33,081 --> 01:13:34,430
warehouseman,
custodian,

1292
01:13:34,431 --> 01:13:37,610
janitor,
material handler and packer.

1293
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:43,360
And then that's it.
So you see that things are getting

1294
01:13:44,401 --> 01:13:48,570
pretty damn dismal for the people who
are have an Iq of 85 and below.

1295
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:54,380
So
now

1296
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:05,740
what's the difference between intellect
and openness?

1297
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:07,270
Proper?
Well,

1298
01:14:07,271 --> 01:14:11,530
one difference is that men seem to be
higher intellect the trade and seem to

1299
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:15,490
be higher in openness and openness seems
to be associated with verbal

1300
01:14:15,491 --> 01:14:20,491
intelligence and with imagination and
with fantasy and with aesthetic

1301
01:14:20,951 --> 01:14:23,320
experience.
And it seems to go along with the fact

1302
01:14:23,321 --> 01:14:27,340
that women read more fiction than men.
So men read nonfiction,

1303
01:14:27,341 --> 01:14:29,080
roughly speaking in women,
read fiction,

1304
01:14:29,081 --> 01:14:31,240
you know,
it's obviously there's a lot of overlap,

1305
01:14:31,241 --> 01:14:34,240
but fundamentally that seems to be how
it distributes.

1306
01:14:34,241 --> 01:14:37,360
Maybe that's also partly because women
are more agreeable and so they're more

1307
01:14:37,361 --> 01:14:40,130
interested in human relations and
characters and you know,

1308
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:43,270
that's the central,
that's the central theme of fiction.

1309
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:48,590
People who are high in openness.
Think divergently.

1310
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:51,230
Here we can do a quick little divergent
thinking tests.

1311
01:14:51,231 --> 01:14:54,620
So why don't we do that.
Take out a piece of paper and a pen and

1312
01:14:54,621 --> 01:14:56,990
a or,
or you can type on your computer.

1313
01:14:56,991 --> 01:14:59,270
I don't care.
You can scratch it onto the desk for all

1314
01:14:59,271 --> 01:15:02,600
I care as long,
but get out a piece of paper so you can

1315
01:15:02,601 --> 01:15:03,710
write on.
And we'll do this.

1316
01:15:03,711 --> 01:15:07,590
So
I'll only give you a minute since you're

1317
01:15:07,610 --> 01:15:10,670
all so fast and we only have six minutes
left.

1318
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:15,410
So write down as many uses as you can
think of for a brick.

1319
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:20,500
You have one minute.
Oh,

1320
01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:13,320
okay.
That's all the time you get.

1321
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:14,890
Okay.
So the first question is,

1322
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:17,680
I'm just going to ask,
you are going to point at you and you

1323
01:16:17,681 --> 01:16:20,830
can answer how many,
how many users did you come up with?

1324
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:26,770
13.
Five.

1325
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:29,680
Youtube?
Yeah.

1326
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:30,533
That's okay.
Eight,

1327
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:34,900
seven,
seven.

1328
01:16:35,570 --> 01:16:37,910
Okay.
Did anybody come up with more than 13?

1329
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:40,103
How many?

1330
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:43,340
14 did anybody come up with?
More than 14.

1331
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,460
Okay.
So you two are the most idiation Lee

1332
01:16:46,461 --> 01:16:50,690
fluent people in the class.
And fluency is a matter of the rip

1333
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:54,200
rapidity with which you can generate
exemplars from a category.

1334
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:58,070
So one of the things that we might ask
just as much would be how many words can

1335
01:16:58,071 --> 01:17:00,110
you write the begin with the letter ass
in a minute.

1336
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:02,600
And there'll be,
you wouldn't believe the bloody range of

1337
01:17:02,601 --> 01:17:04,160
that.
There'll be people will be people who

1338
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:06,050
get six and there'll be people who get
50,

1339
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:09,020
you know,
so idiation will fluency is actually

1340
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:11,240
pretty decent predictor of creative
ability.

1341
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:12,950
Now you know,
that's not a great test,

1342
01:17:12,951 --> 01:17:15,290
right?
Because it was very short and I do that

1343
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:18,930
multiple times with multiple time
durations and different exemplars in

1344
01:17:18,931 --> 01:17:21,700
some across that.
But the correlation between the ideation

1345
01:17:21,701 --> 01:17:24,620
of fluency in longterm creative
achievement is about point three.

1346
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:26,180
It was pretty major.
Okay.

1347
01:17:26,181 --> 01:17:28,430
So let's hear a use for a brick.

1348
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:30,413
How about you?

1349
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:35,530
You can draw on the sidewalk with a
brick.

1350
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:39,250
You a paper weight.
How many people got paperweight?

1351
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:42,190
Yes.
That's a low creative response.

1352
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:44,500
Now why?
That doesn't mean that all your

1353
01:17:44,501 --> 01:17:47,200
responses are,
but it's a technical definition,

1354
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:49,870
right?
So here's what makes a response low

1355
01:17:49,871 --> 01:17:52,060
creative.
Everyone has it.

1356
01:17:52,330 --> 01:17:54,250
Now it's a perfectly reasonable
response.

1357
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:57,340
But for it to be creative virtually by
definition,

1358
01:17:57,341 --> 01:18:02,110
it has to be a low probability response.
That actually makes sense.

1359
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,220
So draw on sidewalk is,
is,

1360
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:07,120
is,
is more low probability response.

1361
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:12,690
Somebody got a weird use for a brick.
Okay?

1362
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,000
Okay.
All right.

1363
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:18,180
Anybody else have that?
They ground their brick into dust for

1364
01:18:18,181 --> 01:18:19,260
something?
No?

1365
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:23,220
Yes.
You could kill someone with a brick.

1366
01:18:23,221 --> 01:18:25,140
Anybody have that?
Yes.

1367
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:27,510
Low agreeableness.
Low creativity.

1368
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:29,611
Yeah.
Yeah.

1369
01:18:29,611 --> 01:18:30,370
Okay.
So we'll go.

1370
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:32,790
Anybody else?
Go to like a peculiar one for a brick

1371
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:33,683
here.

1372
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,273
Look.

1373
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,580
Yeah.
Anybody else have that?

1374
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:39,931
Okay.
So,

1375
01:18:39,931 --> 01:18:40,350
you know,
it's,

1376
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:43,590
it's kind of a lousy musical instrument.
But in a pinch it would work.

1377
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:47,610
Yeah.
Well that's a good one.

1378
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,950
First of all,
you can kill it and then you can drown

1379
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,110
it.
Yeah.

1380
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:53,340
Yeah.
So the way you would score this,

1381
01:18:53,341 --> 01:18:54,870
by the way,
it's quite straight.

1382
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,820
It's not that straightforward actually.
First of all,

1383
01:18:56,821 --> 01:19:01,350
you count the number of responses and
you get rid of ones that are repetitive

1384
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:04,950
and then you also get usually a couple
of people to throw the ones that are

1385
01:19:04,951 --> 01:19:08,400
just like they're neither original nor
practical.

1386
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:11,160
The best responses are original and
practical.

1387
01:19:11,161 --> 01:19:12,930
Now there's a bit of a judgment call
there,

1388
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:15,450
you know what I mean?
But if you get a number of people to do

1389
01:19:15,451 --> 01:19:17,330
the rating,
you can get pretty decent interrater

1390
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:21,120
reliability and so then you score
originality and the way you score

1391
01:19:21,121 --> 01:19:26,121
originality is merely by something like
listing all the responses and then

1392
01:19:27,481 --> 01:19:31,200
calculating how probable or frequent the
responses are in the more infrequent

1393
01:19:31,201 --> 01:19:32,940
responses you get a higher score for.

1394
01:19:33,180 --> 01:19:35,640
So it's,
it's basically a population,

1395
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,320
a sample.
So.

1396
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:41,130
And those things actually work those,
those tests.

1397
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:44,340
Just so you know,
now I'll stop with this.

1398
01:19:44,341 --> 01:19:48,570
This is a,
this is a measure that I derived with

1399
01:19:48,571 --> 01:19:50,880
one of my students when I worked in
Boston,

1400
01:19:50,881 --> 01:19:54,420
her name was Shelly Carson,
and this thing is actually become one of

1401
01:19:54,421 --> 01:19:57,900
the standard measures of creativity in
the creativity literature,

1402
01:19:57,901 --> 01:20:01,860
which is quite fun and it's creative
achievement questionnaire.

1403
01:20:01,861 --> 01:20:04,830
So what I gave you just now is a
creativity test.

1404
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:09,240
It's one of many creativity test.
It wasn't a creative achievement test

1405
01:20:09,241 --> 01:20:12,840
because you can generate uses for a
brick without running out and becoming a

1406
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:14,350
brick entrepreneur,
you know,

1407
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:18,630
so there's a difference between being
able to think divergently and with loose

1408
01:20:18,631 --> 01:20:22,740
associations and then also being able to
put that into practice so you achieve

1409
01:20:22,741 --> 01:20:24,690
something.
And so here's some levels of

1410
01:20:24,691 --> 01:20:25,524
achievement.

1411
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,780
So there's the scientific discovery
domain.

1412
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:31,200
I do not have training or recognized
stability in this field.

1413
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:34,230
I often think about ways that scientific
problems could be solved.

1414
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:37,530
I have won a prize at a science fair or
other local competition.

1415
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:41,220
I've received a scholarship based on my
work in science or medicine.

1416
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:44,610
I've been arthur or core author of a
study published in the scientific

1417
01:20:44,611 --> 01:20:46,750
journal.
I've won a national prize.

1418
01:20:46,751 --> 01:20:49,620
I've received a grant,
my work has been cited by other

1419
01:20:49,621 --> 01:20:52,590
scientists in national publications.
Okay.

1420
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:56,760
And then the same thing for say theater
and film and Culinary Arts.

1421
01:20:56,790 --> 01:21:00,540
Zero is I do not have training or
recognized stability in theater and

1422
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:02,730
film.
Number seven is my theatrical work has

1423
01:21:02,731 --> 01:21:06,150
been recognized in a national
publication for culinary arts.

1424
01:21:06,151 --> 01:21:10,380
I do not have training or experience and
the highest one is my recipes have been

1425
01:21:10,381 --> 01:21:12,030
published nationally.
Okay.

1426
01:21:12,031 --> 01:21:16,890
So
there's 13 different domains

1427
01:21:22,690 --> 01:21:26,170
and that's the distribution.
It's not normally distributed.

1428
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,800
So what you see there actually it's not
quite right because the the median

1429
01:21:32,671 --> 01:21:35,560
answer,
it's about 66 percent of the respondents

1430
01:21:35,561 --> 01:21:38,020
to the creative achievement
questionnaire have a median score of

1431
01:21:38,021 --> 01:21:40,060
zero,
right?

1432
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:43,570
Zero.
They do not have training or talent in

1433
01:21:43,571 --> 01:21:48,210
any of the 13 areas and then there's
some people who are way out on the right

1434
01:21:48,211 --> 01:21:49,270
hand distribution

1435
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:52,700
[inaudible].
You can imagine that once you have

1436
01:21:52,701 --> 01:21:55,190
national exposure in one magazine as a
writer,

1437
01:21:55,191 --> 01:21:58,640
the probability that you're going to get
national exposure again for your second

1438
01:21:58,641 --> 01:22:00,920
novel starts to go up pretty damn high.
Right?

1439
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:05,150
And so you get this terrible step down
function so that almost everybody

1440
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:09,740
aggregates that nothing.
And then a few people are way out in the

1441
01:22:09,741 --> 01:22:13,160
distribution and they just get
everything and there's actually a law,

1442
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:16,850
it's called the matthew principle that
economists use and it's from a statement

1443
01:22:16,851 --> 01:22:21,851
in the New Testament from matthew and
it's a statement where Christ says from

1444
01:22:23,181 --> 01:22:27,770
those who have to those who have
everything more will be given and from

1445
01:22:27,771 --> 01:22:29,990
those who have nothing,
everything will be taken away.

1446
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:34,310
And that seems to be how creative
resources are distributed in the

1447
01:22:34,311 --> 01:22:39,050
population and to a large degree that's
dependent on intelligence,

1448
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:43,100
openness and conscientiousness.
So

1449
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:50,620
you can understand why none of that very
popular with people since you're all

1450
01:22:51,771 --> 01:22:54,350
smart and conscientious though it's
going to work out well for you.

1451
01:22:55,910 --> 01:23:00,910
See you on Tuesday.
I'm going to post your mid term marks.

1452
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:08,390
What we're going to do after that with
regards to the strike,

1453
01:23:08,391 --> 01:23:09,590
I don't.
I can't.

1454
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:10,850
I don't know yet.
