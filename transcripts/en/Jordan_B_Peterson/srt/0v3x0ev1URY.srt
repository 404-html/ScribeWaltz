1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,220
Come to the end of the year,
so I'm going to talk to you a little bit

2
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:12,720
about
the whole course today,

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,230
I guess,
and trying to sum up what

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,090
might be most useful to remember about 
it

5
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,083
and when we started at the beginning I 
made the case to you that people have 

6
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,064
been studying personality and its 
transformations for a very long period 

7
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:37,164
of time and that the earliest
forms of knowledge that we have about 

8
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,140
what people are liking,
how they change

9
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,450
come to us from stories and from very,
very old stories

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,933
and

11
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:01,893
it was stories represent how people act 
in the world fundamentally rather than 

12
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,483
what the world is made of
and the fact that people are confused 

13
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:18,511
about that is part of the reason that 
there's still tremendous confusion about

14
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:22,390
the proper relationship between science 
and religion or science and ethics.

15
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,490
Almost all of the

16
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,823
forms of information transfer that we 
regard as engaging our narrative in 

17
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:33,884
their format.
We love stories and the reason for that 

18
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:41,630
is that stories tell us how,
what people are like and how they behave

19
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:47,140
and they present the world as a place in
which people behave.

20
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,920
And so the stories help us understand 
how people behave,

21
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:59,081
but they also help us understand how 
people must and should behave given that

22
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,903
they have a certain nature and that they
have to organize their behavior with 

23
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:06,584
other people,
and so that puts a set of very serious 

24
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:14,351
constraints on how it is that people
can exist in the world.

25
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,563
The story's basically take two forms.
One form is the description of people 

26
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,530
acting in motivated states of one form 
or another,

27
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,570
and those are usually motivated states 
that everyone is familiar with.

28
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,310
Most stories,
whether they're archaic or modern,

29
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:44,460
have to do with exploration and 
adventure or romance,

30
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,680
and the reason for that is that

31
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,130
we're.

32
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:56,130
We're biologically constructed so that
were adventuresome,

33
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,970
exploratory and interested in intimate 
relationships and so the stories reflect

34
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:07,750
that and they help us understand

35
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,423
how

36
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,363
those fundamental motivations could be 
manifested in behavior in a manner 

37
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:16,174
that's productive,
partly for each individual and then 

38
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:26,971
partly for the individuals in 
relationship to other individuals and to

39
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:32,461
families and to broader communities.
The other form of story that seems to be

40
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:37,584
of critical importance from a historical
perspective is stories that describe 

41
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:45,830
transformation and transformation tends 
to be represented as I'm

42
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,693
using symbolism that's associated with 
death and rebirth and the reason for 

43
00:03:55,141 --> 00:03:56,520
that seems to be that

44
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,990
almost inevitably when you learn 
something new,

45
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:04,824
you learn it because something that 
you're doing or something that you're 

46
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:09,750
using to structure your perceptions no 
longer works,

47
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,590
so pursuit produces a result that you 
don't intend.

48
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,150
And because of that,
before you can learn to restructure your

49
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:18,984
behavior,
you have to allow yourself to let go of 

50
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,910
the things that you're doing that are in
error.

51
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:30,000
And those can be small things in 
situations where only a small correction

52
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:30,834
is required.
But sometimes they can be very large 

53
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:33,334
space and if they're very large things,
then it's as if there's a large element 

54
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:39,564
of your personality or yourself that has
to degenerate and transform itself into 

55
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:48,030
chaos and then reemerge.
Hopefully restructured

56
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,943
and

57
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:51,843
the archaic stories about death and 
rebirth and the transfiguration of the 

58
00:04:55,031 --> 00:05:00,031
soul are stories about the necessity of 
disillusion and disintegration preceding

59
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:03,694
asset.
And it's a very useful thing to know 

60
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:07,240
because it means,
first of all,

61
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,074
that you're going to be resistant to 
learning things as you progress through 

62
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:15,610
life because every time you learn 
something,

63
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:16,444
you have to let go of something that you
hold dear before you can reconstruct 

64
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:20,044
yourself.
And so that accounts for people's 

65
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:25,990
unwillingness to learn things and 
unwillingness to face facts that don't,

66
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,290
that aren't in accordance with their 
current view of the world.

67
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,123
Um,

68
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,663
but it also helps you understand that it
might be worth letting go of the things 

69
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:37,624
that you're doing that aren't productive
because even if it's painful in the 

70
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:40,474
short term,
the consequence might be the kind of 

71
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,660
personality transfer information that 
stops you from having to suffer stupidly

72
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:49,040
as you move through life.
In.

73
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,103
One of the reasons that I
titled This Course Personality and its 

74
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:55,114
transformations is because the 
transformation part of the study of 

75
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:00,074
personality is probably more important 
than the study of personality traits 

76
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:05,060
themselves.
This is part of the reason why,

77
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:05,894
for example,
Piaget thought it was much more 

78
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,030
important to learn how it was that 
people learn things,

79
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,400
that it was to learn what they were 
learning.

80
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,893
So he was more concerned about the 
process by which people generate 

81
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,420
information and transform their 
personalities.

82
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,254
Then he was in determining the nature of
whatever theory it was that people 

83
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:26,024
happen to be using to interact with the 
world at a particular historical stage 

84
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:32,300
or at a particular developmental stage.

85
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,823
And I think one of the things that's 
most important to learn from our CAC 

86
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:38,300
stories,
which is where we started this,

87
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:39,900
is that,
um,

88
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,383
it's much more,
it's much more useful to envision 

89
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:44,564
yourself as something that can 
continually transform in response to 

90
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:49,184
challenge than it is to view yourself as
the static embodiment of any particular 

91
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,100
strategy of knowledge or perception.
And you know,

92
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,230
one of the things that you'll see quite 
frequently,

93
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:02,150
and you certainly see this in 
universities now,

94
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:02,984
I think perhaps you see that the 
university is more than you see it 

95
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,500
anywhere else,
is that people adopt astatic ideological

96
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:12,740
stance on the world and they try to 
interpret everything that happens in the

97
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:15,260
world through the lens of that static 
ideology.

98
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,423
They try to compress the entire world 
into that particular theoretical 

99
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:19,994
framework and become extraordinarily 
upset when the phenomena that confront 

100
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:24,854
them don't fit in accordance with the 
ideology and the reason that people do 

101
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:29,264
that is because they identify themselves
with their ideological beliefs and 

102
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,460
they're static ideological beliefs.

103
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,443
Instead of identifying themselves with 
the part of their personality that's 

104
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:39,164
capable of continually assimilating new 
information and accommodating to it or 

105
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:47,120
transforming and you're much more 
powerful person.

106
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:47,954
If you can.
If you can understand that what's most 

107
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:52,394
essential to you as your capacity to 
transmute and transform as challenges 

108
00:07:56,931 --> 00:08:01,931
come towards you rather than your 
ability to to develop a coherent and all

109
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:06,710
encompassing totalitarian theory and 
attempt to impose it on the world.

110
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,440
I think one of the most tragic
mistakes that modern universities make,

111
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:17,900
especially on the humanities ends of the
distribution,

112
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:22,280
is that people come to university 
looking for orientation in the world,

113
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,143
looking for ways of understanding it,
and essentially they're taught two 

114
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:26,294
things and one is that there is no 
fundamental meaning to things and so 

115
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:33,500
that if your rationalist,
if you're rational and intelligent,

116
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:36,740
being that you're only reasonable 
outlook is nihilistic,

117
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:40,940
and then what seems to go along with 
that is some insistence that you adopt a

118
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:44,630
particular ideological stance as some 
sort of counter position to that.

119
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:48,230
And to me that has nothing to do with 
education at all.

120
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:49,290
That's just.
That's a.

121
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,193
that's.
That's corruption from both directions 

122
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,370
because there was no real utility and 
nihilism and there's no reason to assume

123
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:58,230
that it's the appropriate stance on 
life.

124
00:08:58,231 --> 00:08:59,064
And everything we've learned from the 
20th century indicates that there's 

125
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,483
virtually nothing that you can do that's
more dangerous personally and socially 

126
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,144
than to grasp an ideology and to attempt
to apply it to everything that comes 

127
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:10,614
your way.
And so the fact that universities teach 

128
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:14,590
people how to do that in some 
reasonable.

129
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:15,424
Rick reasonably rigorous way is I think,
nothing short of appalling and I think 

130
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:21,054
the only way that you can,
that you can transcend that is to 

131
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:28,731
understand that what you know is not as 
important as what you yet,

132
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,890
what you have yet to learn,
and what that means is that you can.

133
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:39,650
People often find strength in regarding 
themselves as the sort of being that can

134
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:44,130
comprehend everything and that's that 
sort of being that's competent.

135
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,880
And and,
and what would you say,

136
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:48,923
sufficiently well developed at the 
current point so that they have the 

137
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:53,400
appropriate answers to the appropriate 
questions.

138
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:54,234
But the thing about that that's wrong is
that you don't have the answers and 

139
00:09:57,241 --> 00:09:58,074
often you don't even have the questions.
And so if you can identify it with your 

140
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:02,004
capacity to learn,
that means that you don't have to be 

141
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:05,610
afraid of the things that you don't 
know.

142
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,713
And that means that you can listen to 
people and you can discover new things 

143
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:13,200
and that you can continually make your 
personality expand and transform.

144
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,580
And we have no idea what the limits are 
to the human capacity to transfer,

145
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,020
to expand and transform.
And you're,

146
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,913
you're much more powerful from an 
existential perspective if you regard 

147
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:25,584
yourself as the sort of person who can 
surf on change rather than someone who 

148
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:34,020
has to make everything static and 
unchangeable just so that they can adapt

149
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:34,854
to it.

150
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,580
So I learned a lot of that from reading 
archaic stories and trying to understand

151
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:43,020
exactly what it was that they were 
trying to,

152
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,363
to communicate to people and the 
fundamental communication is that it's 

153
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,610
reasonable to conceptualize the world as
a place of action rather than a place of

154
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:54,984
objects.
And then to regard the central problem 

155
00:10:57,301 --> 00:10:58,134
of human life,
the existential problem as how is it 

156
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:04,980
that you should look in the world and 
look at the world and act on it,

157
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:06,811
you know,
and,

158
00:11:06,811 --> 00:11:09,210
and from a,
from a scientific perspective,

159
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,044
that's generally regarded as something 
that's at the phenomenal because 

160
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,930
behavioral analysis of appropriate 
behavior falls into the domain of ethics

161
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:19,284
and philosophy.
But that's foolish for people because 

162
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:22,134
everything we do revolves around how we 
have to look at the world and how we 

163
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:29,430
have to act.
This is part of the reason that I talked

164
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:30,264
to you about piaget because I think 
piaget had had had cottoned onto 

165
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:35,694
something that was unbelievably profound
and it's an element of getting and 

166
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,240
thinking that generally you don't hear 
much about.

167
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,073
If you take courses on piaget,
especially in relationship to 

168
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:46,974
developmental psychology,
especially North Americans like to 

169
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:54,141
reduce piaget to a list of developmental
stages and that is something that piaget

170
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,714
really wasn't all that concerned about.
He was interested in how the processes 

171
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,303
that people use or how the structures 
that people use to interpret the world 

172
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:07,150
transform across time,
but he wasn't particularly interested in

173
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:10,630
exactly what those stages were and how 
they see actually followed.

174
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:15,400
One another and piaget is a fundamental 
idea was that

175
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:17,763
there were ways of organizing complex 
systems that could sustain themselves 

176
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:27,310
with very little input of energy and 
effort and resources

177
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,643
and the fact that those forms of 
organization exists meant that some 

178
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:35,440
forms of organization were better than 
others.

179
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,250
And the reason that that's so important 
is because piaget,

180
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:40,084
for example,
is one of the only thing that I've ever 

181
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:42,064
come across that managed to transform 
what you might think about as a 

182
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:48,430
qualitative evaluation,
so an evaluation,

183
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:51,880
say of the appropriateness of a solution
to a problem,

184
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:52,960
like a moral problem.

185
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,243
He managed to transform the discussion 
of that into something that was 

186
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:57,424
virtually quantitative and so piaget's 
idea of the equivalent rated state was 

187
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:07,180
the notion that you could set up a 
complicated system so that all the parts

188
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:08,014
of the system,
we're operating in some kind of 

189
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:09,844
harmonious balance.
So the system wasn't continually 

190
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:17,371
fighting itself either at any given 
moment in time or in multiple situations

191
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:18,634
across time.
And so for Piaget and celebrated state 

192
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:26,131
was the state was a state that was 
relatively free of conflict and so it's,

193
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,183
it's.
I started with piaget instead of Freud 

194
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,420
because because people often start 
personality courses with Freud.

195
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:37,210
Piaget actually had the model for how 
people organize themselves.

196
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,583
I think he had a more accurate 
representation of the model of how 

197
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:42,760
people organize themselves than Freud 
did.

198
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:46,900
Now you know that Freud conceptualize 
people as an ego,

199
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,113
right?
With tremendous id like forces 

200
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:51,004
underneath pushing the ego around and we
would think about those as classical 

201
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:55,414
biologically motivated or biologically 
predicated motivations like aggression 

202
00:13:59,561 --> 00:14:00,394
and sexuality and all of the other 
elements of our motivated behavior that 

203
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:05,890
make us animal like Freud thought.

204
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:09,940
If the ego is trapped between those and 
the demands of the social world.

205
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,073
And so he thought of that as an 
intrinsically conflict laden process 

206
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:17,830
where you know you're trying to manifest
all.

207
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:22,420
You have your animal instincts as a,
as an animalistic individual and society

208
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:26,860
is attempting to him that in and and 
repress it and and inhibited.

209
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:31,890
Because as a pure manifestation of 
biological and melody,

210
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,790
you're dangerous and not properly.
You know,

211
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,624
you're.
You can't fit into a social environment 

212
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:39,154
without inhibiting that are sublimating 
it or transforming it at some in some 

213
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:45,830
manner.
Whereas the Piagetian perspective is,

214
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,060
is,
is,

215
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,830
is more something that's predicated on 
the idea of a game.

216
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,593
And I think it's a more sophisticated 
way of looking at it because when you 

217
00:14:57,171 --> 00:14:59,510
look at how children organized their 
personalities,

218
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:01,910
especially between the ages of two and 
four,

219
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,490
it's certainly the case that to some 
degree,

220
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:08,960
they learned to inhibit their impulses 
as a consequence of social pressure.

221
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,793
But it's much more,
it's much more appropriate and accurate 

222
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:14,834
to notice that actually what they mostly
learned to do between the ages of two 

223
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:22,820
and four is get along with themselves 
and get along with others.

224
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,710
And so what's happening is,
you know,

225
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:25,544
they,
they burst onto the world with a set of 

226
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:32,390
sub personalities that are predicated in
biological reality.

227
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,224
So they're hungry and they're thirsty 
and they have to maintain their body 

228
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:36,164
temperature to a certain level.
And they have to learn how to cope with 

229
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:42,250
all of the demands of being a biological
entity like,

230
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,840
like toilet training and,
and,

231
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:45,674
uh,
learning how to share and learning how 

232
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:47,834
to play with siblings and establishing a
relationship with parents and so forth 

233
00:15:50,511 --> 00:15:51,344
and so on.
But the way they seem to do that is by 

234
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:58,130
organizing their behavior into more and 
more complicated and sophisticated games

235
00:15:58,131 --> 00:16:00,820
that stack on top of one another,
you know,

236
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:05,830
so the child learns how to regulate 
their biological rhythms and go to sleep

237
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,064
at the appropriate time and wake up at 
the appropriate time and if the parents 

238
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:10,754
scaffold them properly,
then they learned to eat at the proper 

239
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,020
time so that so that the.

240
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,340
So the,
the,

241
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,970
the.
They're not dysregulated by,

242
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,193
by,
by starvation or hunger or thirst and 

243
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,223
they're not dysregulated by temperature 
extremes and they learned how to 

244
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,933
incorporate their aggression into 
cooperative games rather than how to 

245
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:33,914
inhibit it and they make their 
personalities more and more 

246
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,094
sophisticated as they're doing that and 
they learn how to play a larger and 

247
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:40,394
larger number of more and more 
complicated games with more and more 

248
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:44,264
people.
And that's a kind of hierarchical 

249
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:46,964
organization that extends inside the 
person in so far as they're organizing 

250
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:52,514
their fundamental biological motivations
and their emotions and then starts to 

251
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:56,714
extend beyond the individual as they 
start to organize their fundamental 

252
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:02,600
motivations and their emotions.
Well,

253
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:07,601
other people are doing the same thing 
and it's out of that continual interplay

254
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:08,564
of game,
like cooperation and competition that 

255
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:11,564
it,
that society itself emerges and that's 

256
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:18,200
not on an inhibitory or conflict laden 
model.

257
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,273
The conflict between society and the 
individual in the Piagetian model only 

258
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,533
occurs when the when the game like 
structure of the personality is not 

259
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:28,784
sophisticated enough to interact 
properly with the environment at that 

260
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:32,354
point and so you can see that the,
that the idea of a pig and equilibrated 

261
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:37,874
state is that you could imagine an 
individual at all of the levels of 

262
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:44,300
existence that the individual exists at 
from,

263
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,583
you know,
the micro caused them the micro world 

264
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:50,670
way down at the Subatomic,
in the atomic level,

265
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:51,504
stacked up on top of each other all the 
way up to the societal level so that 

266
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,273
everything in that hierarchical 
organization organization is working to 

267
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,320
make every level work properly.
And that's,

268
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,680
I think,
I think it's a really good model for,

269
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,040
for what you might conceptualize as,
as,

270
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,470
as mental health.
Broadly speaking.

271
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,903
Because your mental health is of course 
dependent on the appropriate 

272
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,340
organization of your psychophysiology.

273
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,173
But it's also dependent on the earth and
the integration of that organized 

274
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,013
psychophysiology into an intimate 
relationship and then into a familial 

275
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:29,634
relationship and into a relationship 
with the community and then into a 

276
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:35,820
relationship with the structures that 
are beyond the community.

277
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:38,450
And you know the fact that many of your 
concern,

278
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,640
for example,
with environmental issues means that you

279
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:45,960
understand at some level that in order 
for your being to be optimized,

280
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:46,794
you also have to exist in some 
relatively harmonious manner inside 

281
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:51,414
large biological ecosystems.
So economic ecosystems and political 

282
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,363
ecosystems and social ecosystems and 
biological ecosystems and all of those 

283
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:03,000
levels have to be stacked on top of one 
another.

284
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:06,390
So each level supports and fosters all 
the other levels.

285
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,703
And that's a very complicated.
That's a very complicated thing to 

286
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:10,914
attain.
And it's also something that has to be 

287
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,820
continually negotiate it and transformed
because of course you're trying to stack

288
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:20,580
all these processes in a hierarchical 
manner,

289
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:25,500
in a self sustaining hierarchical manner
in an environment that also continues to

290
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:26,670
shift and move.

291
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:31,850
So not only do you have to stack up this
structure to begin with and and organize

292
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,410
it,
but you have to transform it at whatever

293
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:39,030
level needs to be transformed as you 
move throughout the dynamic environment.

294
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:42,720
That changes from day to day.
It's a very complicated process.

295
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:48,290
Now it seems to me that that one of the 
things that you can come to understand,

296
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:51,150
and this is something that I took at 
least in part from,

297
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:56,540
from reading you,
is that that the process that you engage

298
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:57,444
in when you're organizing your 
personality in this hierarchical 

299
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:03,450
structure and the process that you 
engage in,

300
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:04,284
well you're updating.
It actually manifests itself as 

301
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:09,870
intrinsically meaningful.
So there's.

302
00:20:09,871 --> 00:20:10,704
There's,
there's an element of your off your 

303
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,673
intrinsic being that's actually devoted 
towards fostering that process and when 

304
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,790
people talk about the idea that life 
might have some meaning,

305
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:24,624
it seems to me that you can actually 
experience that meeting when you're 

306
00:20:27,631 --> 00:20:28,464
engaged in the process of producing this
hierarchically organized structure and 

307
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:33,750
balancing and maintaining it across 
time.

308
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,090
And I think,
and this is and idea too,

309
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,193
I think that what you experienced that 
as his engagement when you're very much 

310
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,023
interested in something that you're 
doing and you're sunk right into it so 

311
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:47,484
that you're not even self conscious and 
so that time itself isn't ticking away 

312
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,750
in a painful manner,
but,

313
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,930
but something that you're not even 
really aware of.

314
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,793
You're not even aware of time 
progressing when you're in that sort of 

315
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:01,360
state.
Then that's a signal from your,

316
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,910
from your.
I wouldn't say from your nervous system,

317
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:04,744
but from being itself that you're in a 
position where all the levels of being 

318
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:12,400
are properly organized.
And I think that people experienced that

319
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:16,300
as a deeply meaningful state of being.
And I don't think that that has anything

320
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:18,340
to do with rationality.
You know,

321
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:19,174
because you can as nature pointed out 
when we talked about the 

322
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:22,930
existentialists,
you know,

323
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:27,931
you can make a very strong case that 
from a rational perspective that life is

324
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:30,130
devoid of meaning.

325
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:30,963
But the problem with that is that it 
starts out with the presupposition that 

326
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:39,130
the rational analysis of the situation 
that brings that question to life is the

327
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:39,964
proper level of analysis.
And I don't think there's any evidence 

328
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:44,050
for that at all.
You know,

329
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:44,884
one of the things that Carl Rogers 
continually pointed out in his 

330
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,753
phenomenological approach was that to 
evaluate how you're progressing through 

331
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:54,814
life,
you cannot only rely on your 

332
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:57,514
rationality,
it's a mistake because you're an 

333
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:03,760
embodied creature and you're constantly 
being informed by all sorts of processes

334
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,790
that can't be reduced to straightforward
rationality.

335
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:07,624
And that it's a mistake to assume that 
the rational mode of interpretation of 

336
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,683
experience from moment to moment is the 
one that should actually be super 

337
00:22:15,931 --> 00:22:17,640
superordinate.
And it's,

338
00:22:17,641 --> 00:22:21,370
it's a mistake partly because you're 
more complicated than your rationality.

339
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:25,540
And so is existence itself is being 
itself,

340
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:26,410
you know?

341
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,243
And,
and for the existentialists and the 

342
00:22:28,841 --> 00:22:31,240
phenomenologists,
especially following heidegger,

343
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:32,074
the question was the nature of being.
And I think that's the proper question 

344
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,203
to pose to yourself when you're trying 
to assess exactly what constitutes the 

345
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:44,950
human personality.
You know when these things to me as part

346
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:45,784
of the reason that I was so interested 
in the existential approach because the 

347
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:48,964
existentialist take the idea one step 
further and it's in a very complicated 

348
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:53,134
and sophisticated way.
Now they they make the case that you 

349
00:22:57,521 --> 00:23:02,521
have an ethical responsibility to being 
and so that would be to your being,

350
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:03,574
but to being a general in the ethical 
responsibilities that you have to 

351
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:07,444
confront it straightforwardly and 
honestly and the way that the 19th and 

352
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:15,670
20th century existentialists came to.
That was really twofold.

353
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,250
It was mostly from the negative 
direction,

354
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:19,084
so people like frank girl and social 
units and when they were pushing the 

355
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:25,930
idea that it was necessary to have a 
truthful relationship with being.

356
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:26,763
The reason they came up with that 
conclusion was by observing those 

357
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:33,580
circumstances where people clearly did 
not do that.

358
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,130
And so for Frankel.
That was basically.

359
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,893
That was basically his observations of 
what happened in Nazi Germany and for 

360
00:23:41,531 --> 00:23:44,380
soldier an incident.
It was his observations of what happened

361
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,214
in this.
In establishing the Soviet Union and in 

362
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:48,224
other places that were directly 
committed to a comprehensive 

363
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:52,903
totalitarian view of reality and their 
observations were that as soon as that 

364
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,693
totalitarian viewpoint was imposed and 
everyone acted as if every problem had 

365
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:05,594
been finally solved,
the immediate consequence of that was 

366
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:08,624
that everyone had to lie about 
everything they did in order to support 

367
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:14,480
the system.
And the next consequence of that was the

368
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:15,314
system became radically genocidal and 
murderous and so for Franklin soldier 

369
00:24:19,971 --> 00:24:22,060
Nitsa and their,
their.

370
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:27,090
Their diagnosis of that was that it was 
necessary for individual people to adopt

371
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:28,154
a truthful relationship with being.
Because the consequence of not doing 

372
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:32,744
that was the degeneration of everything 
into something that basically resembled 

373
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:36,404
hell.
And so you can align that idea with the 

374
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,783
Piagetian idea of the game like 
hierarchy and you can say something 

375
00:24:44,031 --> 00:24:48,180
like,
and this is also drawing on the idea,

376
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:53,190
say of Rogers and the ideas of,
of he described it as authentic being is

377
00:24:53,211 --> 00:24:54,044
that the pathway to the appropriate 
hierarchical organization of the 

378
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:02,060
personality from the microcosm up to the
macrocosm is actually

379
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:05,710
fostered by your relationship with 
truth.

380
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,320
You know,
and for for Rogers,

381
00:25:08,321 --> 00:25:09,154
he talked about the physiological 
psychophysiological manifestations of 

382
00:25:12,161 --> 00:25:17,050
that for rogers,
that was partly the willingness to

383
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,663
enter into a dialogue with your physical
being which which is also a notion that 

384
00:25:22,781 --> 00:25:23,614
the psychoanalysts push in a slightly 
different direction because people like 

385
00:25:27,221 --> 00:25:28,054
Freud,
regardless of the fact that his notion 

386
00:25:30,971 --> 00:25:33,300
of what constitutes socialization was 
to,

387
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,343
was to predicated on conflict.
One of the things that fried certainly 

388
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:38,374
continually pointed out was that it was 
necessary for you to bring all of the 

389
00:25:42,101 --> 00:25:46,600
diverse elements of your personality 
into into the game,

390
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,520
right?
Do you work to repress things?

391
00:25:48,521 --> 00:25:51,070
You weren't to forget things.
You weren't supposed to leave.

392
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,083
Elements of your being that were that 
were troublesome and difficult to 

393
00:25:55,601 --> 00:25:56,434
integrate.
You weren't supposed to leave those 

394
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,930
lying out where nothing could be done 
with them and because the consequence of

395
00:26:01,931 --> 00:26:06,931
that would be that those
dissociated parts of you would become

396
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,700
would become pathological and dangerous 
and so they would pose a threat to you,

397
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,990
but also because if you didn't 
incorporate

398
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,903
those cast off elements of being,
then your personality would be too weak 

399
00:26:24,641 --> 00:26:26,890
to prevail.
For Freud,

400
00:26:26,891 --> 00:26:30,430
of course,
those that the probability was very high

401
00:26:30,431 --> 00:26:31,264
that the cast off elements of being 
would be those that were associated 

402
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,653
fundamentally with aggression and with 
sexuality because you might think that 

403
00:26:37,511 --> 00:26:38,344
those are the two most dangerous 
motivational forces that people have at 

404
00:26:42,551 --> 00:26:43,384
hand,
but you know you're a pretty hollow in 

405
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:47,610
thin person if you're not capable of 
aggression,

406
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,880
and if your sexual morality is 
continually as as only predicated on,

407
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,353
well your inability to engage in sexual 
activity because no one wants you or 

408
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,820
because you're repressing it and very 
awkward and unskilled out.

409
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,400
It's in so that the question never even 
arises.

410
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,230
You know that's.
That's the.

411
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,303
That's the approach people take when 
they try to make their children's so 

412
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:12,563
naive about sexuality and so protected 
that they're terrified to have anything 

413
00:27:16,081 --> 00:27:19,260
to do with it whatsoever and that might 
work very well.

414
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:22,590
As long as they're in a situation where 
there are so

415
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,753
underdeveloped and repressed that no one
has wants to have anything to do with 

416
00:27:28,701 --> 00:27:29,534
them.
But as soon as they get out into the 

417
00:27:30,261 --> 00:27:32,990
world where sexual behavior,
for example,

418
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,843
starts to become a possibility.
All that does is leave them completely 

419
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,053
open to their own pathologies,
into the predatory behavior of other 

420
00:27:41,091 --> 00:27:43,520
people.
It's not much of a solution.

421
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,863
Now,
the,

422
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,713
the,
the existentialist idea and that's the 

423
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,473
idea of authentic being is that the most
appropriate way to interact with being 

424
00:27:57,651 --> 00:28:02,651
as an emergency is is by maintaining 
some relationship with truth.

425
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,943
Now it's a very difficult concept to to 
really come to grips with because it's 

426
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,150
of course,
as as is famously known.

427
00:28:11,151 --> 00:28:15,470
It's not that easy to identify exactly 
what constitutes truth.

428
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,890
I think that's part of the reason why 
Franklin Solzhenitsyn,

429
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:22,190
when they were talking about the 
existential approach to being.

430
00:28:22,191 --> 00:28:23,024
We're more likely to concentrate on 
false hood rather than on truth per se 

431
00:28:26,691 --> 00:28:29,780
because I think it's easier.
You can think about this yourself,

432
00:28:29,781 --> 00:28:30,614
but I think it's easier for each of us 
to identify when we're doing something 

433
00:28:34,371 --> 00:28:35,204
wrong than it is for us to determine 
whether or not we happen to be on the 

434
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:44,051
right path because the the issue of 
whether right now you're doing something

435
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:46,940
wrong is simpler in some sense.

436
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,863
Then the question then,
then trying to understand whether the 

437
00:28:50,781 --> 00:28:51,614
sum total of all your actions right now 
are those that will put you into the 

438
00:28:54,861 --> 00:28:55,694
appropriate place into the future.
So I think that as you establish a 

439
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:02,090
relationship with truth,
the first thing that you try to do is to

440
00:29:02,091 --> 00:29:02,924
start lying and that's not exactly the 
same thing as telling the truth because 

441
00:29:06,921 --> 00:29:10,730
I would say you can't actually tell the 
truth because you don't know what it is,

442
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:15,480
but you can certainly strive not to 
talk,

443
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:19,430
not to speak or act in ways that you 
know to be false.

444
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:23,540
And I think that by doing that,
that's part of how you,

445
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,793
you,
you integrate your personality and you 

446
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:27,764
strengthen your personality across time 
and also how you learn to understand 

447
00:29:31,881 --> 00:29:36,550
larger and larger sections of what might
actually be true rather than what

448
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,513
that

449
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:43,150
instead of only being able to identify 
from moment to moment what's false.

450
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,790
No one character guard would say,
well,

451
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:48,624
there's.
There's an element of faith in a 

452
00:29:50,131 --> 00:29:50,964
decision like that.
And I can tell you a little bit about 

453
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,993
what he meant.
So we know when we were talking about 

454
00:29:55,681 --> 00:29:56,514
Carl Rogers,
we talked about instrumental use of 

455
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,040
language,
right?

456
00:29:59,041 --> 00:29:59,874
So the idea there would be that I'm 
using language constantly to get what I 

457
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:07,080
want from the world in any given 
situation.

458
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,343
The,
that instrumental use is predicated on 

459
00:30:09,961 --> 00:30:14,220
the idea that I know what I want and 
that I know what's good for me.

460
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,230
And the problem is,
is that's a very,

461
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:17,803
um,
it's very unlikely that that's true 

462
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,200
because you don't know what's good for 
you in the final analysis because you're

463
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:26,034
too ignorant to know.
And so if you're using language to 

464
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:33,090
manipulate the world to ensure that 
things turn out the way you want them to

465
00:30:33,091 --> 00:30:33,924
right now,
then you're acting as if your knowledge 

466
00:30:37,351 --> 00:30:41,250
about what constitutes the good is 
sufficiently well developed and final so

467
00:30:41,251 --> 00:30:44,880
that you can rely on it as a guide to 
what you're going to say and do.

468
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,520
Now,
the alternative to that is something.

469
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,030
There is an alternative to that,
but it's a very complicated alternative.

470
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,630
And the alternative to that is something
more like,

471
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,080
it has more to do with reliance on your 
capacity to transform.

472
00:31:00,081 --> 00:31:00,914
Because here's an alternative to that 
kind of rigid and manipulative approach 

473
00:31:04,851 --> 00:31:08,630
to life,
and the alternative is to try to act out

474
00:31:08,631 --> 00:31:13,631
what you think is appropriate and to 
save what you think is true as carefully

475
00:31:13,941 --> 00:31:17,330
as you possibly can,
and then to see what happens

476
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:22,290
and that's a completely different way of
approaching the situation and it's a lot

477
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:24,550
more interesting.
No,

478
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,453
I mean,
one of the things I've been thinking 

479
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:27,684
about is I truly believe that the idea 
that that people speak potential into 

480
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,543
being is accurate.
I think that what we face as we move 

481
00:31:38,611 --> 00:31:39,444
through life is a realm of potential 
that's in front of us that we can 

482
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:46,740
continually interact with and I think 
that that's actually helped people think

483
00:31:46,741 --> 00:31:48,510
about the world when they think about 
it,

484
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,673
because we think of the future as a 
place of diverse possibilities and we 

485
00:31:53,191 --> 00:31:54,024
think of the future as something we can 
maneuver through and turning into 

486
00:31:57,571 --> 00:31:59,630
actuality.
Now.

487
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,573
That's what we think about when we,
when we think about potential and and 

488
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,313
about realizing the potential in things 
and the potential in ourselves and the 

489
00:32:07,531 --> 00:32:10,470
potential in other people.
Well then you ask yourself,

490
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:12,510
well,
what do you think?

491
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,553
What's the best technology that you have
at your disposal for transforming 

492
00:32:19,411 --> 00:32:20,244
potential into the kind of actuality 
that you would actually want to see 

493
00:32:22,951 --> 00:32:24,780
around you?
And then you might ask yourself,

494
00:32:24,781 --> 00:32:25,614
well,
is it more likely that you're going to 

495
00:32:27,301 --> 00:32:28,134
get the actuality that you want by 
trying to trying to grapple with 

496
00:32:33,031 --> 00:32:33,864
potential in a truthful manner?
Or is it more likely that you're going 

497
00:32:37,111 --> 00:32:39,060
to get the kind of actuality that you 
want?

498
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,003
You grappled with reality in a manner 
that's rife with falsehood and I would 

499
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,830
say,
well if,

500
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:49,580
if framing potential into actuality is 
like building a house,

501
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:52,550
then I would say if you build a house 
out of the proper materials,

502
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:55,370
then it might stand.
But if you build a house out of cap rate

503
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:56,204
materials and you,
you take shortcuts wherever you can and 

504
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:01,910
you pretend things are other than what 
they are.

505
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,600
Then as soon as the ground shakes,
your house is going to fall.

506
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,170
And that seems to me to be something 
that's fundamentally undeniable.

507
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,353
You know,
if you mix too much sand in your 

508
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:12,374
Samantha and your foundation is going to
be weak and you can do that merely by 

509
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:17,534
ignoring what you know,
and so I think that the root out of 

510
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,580
inauthentic being in the root out of our
proclivity to identify with,

511
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,893
with ultimately genocidal ideologies is 
to attempt to establish a relationship 

512
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:35,990
with being that's predicated on at least
not on falsehood,

513
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:40,460
at least that you know in.
One of the things Rogers would say,

514
00:33:40,461 --> 00:33:41,294
and I think he's right about this,
is that if you consult the totality of 

515
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:47,450
your being,
when you're acting and you're speaking,

516
00:33:47,451 --> 00:33:48,284
you can tell by paying attention to the 
way that you're responding to your 

517
00:33:52,521 --> 00:33:53,690
actions.
Enter your.

518
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,733
Enter your words whether or not what 
you're doing and saying is pulling you 

519
00:33:57,921 --> 00:33:58,754
together and making you integrate it and
making you strong or whether it's 

520
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:06,791
pulling you apart and disintegrate you 
and making you weak and roll.

521
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:07,803
One of Roger's claims was that that's 
actually a psychophysiological 

522
00:34:10,491 --> 00:34:12,230
sensations.
He called that.

523
00:34:12,231 --> 00:34:13,064
You know,
he described that in association with 

524
00:34:14,181 --> 00:34:17,390
the wisdom of the body and are you 
really believe that to be true?

525
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:18,224
I mean,
I can see this when I'm talking to 

526
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:23,480
people when I'm talking to my clients or
when I'm talking to other people,

527
00:34:23,481 --> 00:34:27,890
I can see as soon as they start to 
misuse their words are start to use them

528
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:28,724
in an instrumental manner.
Like the strength goes out of them 

529
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:31,784
completely and you can detect that 
there's something shallow and false 

530
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:36,134
going on and you know,
if you call people's attention to that 

531
00:34:38,901 --> 00:34:39,734
fact when it's happening,
they're often rather resistant to 

532
00:34:41,901 --> 00:34:42,734
noticing it.
But if they do open their eyes and pay 

533
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:45,794
attention to it,
they can see right away that that's 

534
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:48,434
what's occurring

535
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,340
now.
When we moved into it,

536
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,730
when we move towards Freud in Yom.
Well,

537
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,623
I mean I was extremely interested in 
young and I have been extremely 

538
00:35:05,091 --> 00:35:05,924
interested in young because he's one of 
the few things that I've ever 

539
00:35:08,061 --> 00:35:08,894
encountered who takes culture seriously 
and he believes that it's necessary 

540
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:17,000
because we're historical creatures and 
we're.

541
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,223
We're shaped by historical facts that 
it's necessary for us to understand our 

542
00:35:22,071 --> 00:35:22,904
culture and our past because we're 
embodying it because we're historically 

543
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:27,494
constructed creatures and so the reason 
to study history is because history is 

544
00:35:30,771 --> 00:35:31,604
you and if you don't understand history 
than history is gonna have it's gonna 

545
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,123
have you in its clutches and it's going 
to be moving you from place to place 

546
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,940
because it was young who formulated the 
idea,

547
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:44,760
for example,
that people don't have ideas.

548
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:49,860
That ideas have people and I think that 
if you take that notion seriously,

549
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:52,370
it's one of the most frightening things 
you can ever realized.

550
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:56,610
Because of course everyone thinks that 
they have ideas.

551
00:35:56,611 --> 00:35:58,470
But if you look at people,
for example,

552
00:35:58,471 --> 00:35:59,304
who are possessed by an ideology,
obviously the idea has them because you 

553
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:06,360
can predict exactly what they're going 
to say and do.

554
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:07,194
In every situation.
You can predict exactly what solution 

555
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:10,974
they're going to bring to the table.
Whenever you discuss any problem and if 

556
00:36:14,941 --> 00:36:15,774
you come up with an idea about a problem
and you come up with an idea about the 

557
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:19,944
problem and it's the same idea,
the probability that it's you coming up 

558
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,440
with it,
are you coming up with it is zero.

559
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,633
It's whatever it is that's coming up 
with the same idea is the thing that's 

560
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:30,564
got control.
You know when you see this with people 

561
00:36:32,731 --> 00:36:35,340
all the time,
when they arbitrarily divide the world,

562
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:36,174
for example,
up into those things that are good and 

563
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:39,870
acceptable in those things that aren't.

564
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,063
You see this with right wingers and use 
it with left-wingers because the right 

565
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,334
wingers make the claim that government 
is evil and the left wing makes the 

566
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:51,150
claim that corporations are evil and if 
you take five left wingers,

567
00:36:51,151 --> 00:36:54,300
you can tell exactly what they're going 
to say about any given problem.

568
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:57,180
And if you take five right wingers,
it's exactly the same thing.

569
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:02,130
So then that brings up the question,
who exactly is doing the talking and the

570
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:03,810
thinking?
Of course,

571
00:37:03,811 --> 00:37:07,380
the people who are spouting those ideas,
things that they're doing the thinking,

572
00:37:07,381 --> 00:37:08,214
but there's no reason to assume that 
that's the case at all and I can tell 

573
00:37:10,891 --> 00:37:13,290
you something else that you can 
determine right away.

574
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,070
People are dead boring when they're 
spouting etiological clap trap.

575
00:37:17,071 --> 00:37:17,904
You could hardly even listened to them,
but you can take virtually anyone 

576
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:21,384
educated or uneducated,
and if they start to tell you the truth 

577
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:27,690
about their own experience,
even if they do that in a stumbling way,

578
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:28,524
in a halting way,
they become fascinating instantly 

579
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,220
because they're the only people who have
access to that information and it's rich

580
00:37:35,221 --> 00:37:38,640
and deep information and you know that 
it's personal.

581
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,270
It's,
it's,

582
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,103
it's,
it's,

583
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,800
it's material that they have a right to,
you know,

584
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:44,634
and they can intermingle that with ideas
that the culture has produced even in 

585
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:48,834
theological ideas and come up with 
something that's richer and more 

586
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:53,064
brilliant as a consequence of that.
But if they're not speaking their own 

587
00:37:55,801 --> 00:37:56,850
words,
well,

588
00:37:56,851 --> 00:37:57,684
first of all,
there's something else that's speaking 

589
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:00,420
through them.
And second,

590
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,370
there's something about it.
It's dead.

591
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,880
So I don't remember if I told you the,
the origin of the word slogan,

592
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:14,430
so slogan comes from to Welsh words and 
one is slew egg,

593
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:15,950
which is Slu a,
g,

594
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,210
H,
and the other is Gary,

595
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,890
g,
h a I r m.

596
00:38:19,891 --> 00:38:24,870
So it's slew a Garren.
Garren means gerome means the battle cry

597
00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:29,640
of the data and that to me is a perfect 
example.

598
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,503
Often it's a perfectly example of how 
fascinating the process by which he 

599
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:38,470
words emerge actually is,
but it's also a dead accurate

600
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,193
description of what's speaking through a
person when their languages being 

601
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,623
reduced to slogan and they're not paying
any attention to their own 

602
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:51,723
individualized being.
And what it is is that it's the army of 

603
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:57,400
the dead in some sense speaking through 
them.

604
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:01,180
There's no spirit there.
There's nothing that's alive.

605
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:02,014
And I don't think that being possessed 
by the army of the dead is a very good 

606
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:07,870
idea.
I mean it's,

607
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:10,983
that's all wisdom that was useful for 
the past and that's lost its ability to 

608
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:15,670
be applicable to the president.

609
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,833
One of the other things that seems to me
that happen to people in university is 

610
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,560
they don't really get educated about how
important what they do actually is,

611
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,823
you know,
and I think that goes along with the 

612
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:32,670
nihilistic cast of modern,
of modern people.

613
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,820
You know,
it's easy to view yourself as one little

614
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,400
dust mote floating around in a,
uh,

615
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:42,300
you know,
in a stadium full of dust motes and air.

616
00:39:42,301 --> 00:39:43,134
So you're all disconnected with each 
other and none of you have any causal 

617
00:39:45,931 --> 00:39:46,764
impact on anyone else around the hole.
But I don't think there's any reason to 

618
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,420
conceptualize yourself using that model 
at all.

619
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,283
Because the first thing that is very 
easy to notice is that you're very much 

620
00:39:58,291 --> 00:39:59,850
networked.
You know.

621
00:39:59,851 --> 00:40:00,684
And so over the course of your life,
you're going to have direct and 

622
00:40:03,451 --> 00:40:06,660
relatively profound influence on several
thousand people.

623
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,270
And some of you may be more and some of 
you less,

624
00:40:09,271 --> 00:40:11,940
but we could certainly say a thousand 
people,

625
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,283
you know,
in each of those thousand people will 

626
00:40:14,171 --> 00:40:15,150
know a thousand people.

627
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:18,000
And that's a million.
And one step past that is a billion.

628
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:18,834
And so you basically sit in the center 
of a network that with very limited 

629
00:40:23,251 --> 00:40:25,980
extension covers virtually everyone on 
the planet,

630
00:40:25,981 --> 00:40:26,814
and that's becoming more and more true 
rather than less and less true as 

631
00:40:29,881 --> 00:40:33,000
everyone becomes increasingly networked 
and connected.

632
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,313
And so what that implies is that the 
things that you do that you choose to 

633
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:38,970
do,
or the things that you choose not to do,

634
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,073
are going to have effects that ripple 
far beyond your particular individual 

635
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:45,114
existence.
And so part of what that means is that 

636
00:40:47,251 --> 00:40:48,084
all of the choices that you make as 
you're confronting that unstructured 

637
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:52,074
future as you move through your life are
going to alter the structure of being 

638
00:40:55,051 --> 00:40:57,060
itself.
You know,

639
00:40:57,061 --> 00:41:01,890
and one of the things that
I've showed you guys repeatedly,

640
00:41:01,891 --> 00:41:02,724
that hierarchy of action right there 
with a highest resolution level being 

641
00:41:06,811 --> 00:41:09,210
the things that you actually do with 
your body,

642
00:41:09,211 --> 00:41:11,940
the muscle movements that you manifest 
in the world and,

643
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,170
and showed you how those are 
hierarchically organized into higher and

644
00:41:16,171 --> 00:41:18,150
higher systems of value.

645
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:21,420
You know?
And when I showed you that hierarchy,

646
00:41:21,421 --> 00:41:24,420
the thing I put at the top was be a good
person.

647
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:25,913
Well,
I think that that can be elaborated out 

648
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:30,443
in a reasonable manner so that it's 
possible to understand more and more 

649
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,123
being a good person is about.
Part of it is that you have to have 

650
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:38,474
organized yourself into something that's
well structured and useful and I think 

651
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:42,584
you do that by disciplining yourself and
by adopting some role in the world 

652
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:51,971
that's that's meaningful and profound so
that you have to so that the so that the

653
00:41:53,961 --> 00:41:54,794
stress and demands of of that organized 
you into something that's that's strong 

654
00:42:00,411 --> 00:42:03,680
and flexible and productive and so 
that's one element of it.

655
00:42:03,681 --> 00:42:04,514
I think of that as a kind of 
apprenticeship element and I think I 

656
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:10,730
learned that mostly from nature because 
one of nature's claims was that in order

657
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,760
to become properly developed as a human 
being,

658
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,410
you had to undergo a position.

659
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,303
A.
You had to undergo a process of 

660
00:42:19,131 --> 00:42:21,350
voluntary slavery.
In some sense.

661
00:42:21,351 --> 00:42:22,184
You had to.
You had to give yourself over to some 

662
00:42:25,641 --> 00:42:28,790
sort of role.
Perhaps it doesn't even matter what role

663
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:29,624
so that you became an expert at that and
that was going to cost you in that 

664
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,420
you're going to be bent and twisted into
that role,

665
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,523
but it's also going to discipline and 
organize you and the alternative is to 

666
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:43,610
become nothing you know and that's not a
useful alternative.

667
00:42:43,611 --> 00:42:46,730
So you want to become something and then
once you become something,

668
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:50,240
well then you want to be able to 
transform that something into,

669
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:53,420
into whatever is necessary at that 
particular point.

670
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:54,254
And I think that that's where the ideas 
that are associated with heroin 

671
00:42:57,321 --> 00:42:58,154
mythology start to become particularly 
relevant to considerations of higher 

672
00:43:02,151 --> 00:43:03,980
order ethics.
Because the hero,

673
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:09,980
the hero in mythology is the hero in 
mythology,

674
00:43:09,981 --> 00:43:14,981
is the representation of the human being
in so far as mankind understands what it

675
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:16,124
is to be human and what the hero does is
confront the things that he or she does 

676
00:43:20,091 --> 00:43:20,924
not understand and take what's valuable 
from that confrontation and then 

677
00:43:25,131 --> 00:43:28,370
reintegrated into the personality and 
the society.

678
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,203
That's why the hero goes out to where 
the dragon is and takes the gold and 

679
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:36,020
then brings the gold back to the 
community and distributes it,

680
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:37,970
and so I would say,
well,

681
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:42,470
part of being a good person is being 
good for something and then another part

682
00:43:42,471 --> 00:43:43,304
of being a good person is being better 
than being good for something because 

683
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,140
you want to be not only good for 
something,

684
00:43:48,141 --> 00:43:51,650
but you want to be able to be good for 
something in a way that keeps making you

685
00:43:51,651 --> 00:43:53,780
better and better at being good for 
something.

686
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,180
And that means you can't just be 
something.

687
00:43:56,181 --> 00:43:58,730
It means that you have to become 
something constantly.

688
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,193
And I,
and I think that the tremendous amount 

689
00:44:02,721 --> 00:44:03,554
of what constitutes the intrinsic 
meaning of life can be found in that 

690
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,610
attempt to continually expand and 
reorganize as you're expanding.

691
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,970
Because this is a union idea.

692
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:14,803
I mean human beings are cognitively 
dynamic creatures and we find intrinsic 

693
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,500
worth in participating in that 
cognitively dynamic process.

694
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:27,110
So.
And then I think outside of that,

695
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:28,910
there's another question which is,
well,

696
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:32,100
what it is,
what is it exactly you're aiming at?

697
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,540
And My,
my experience has taught me,

698
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:37,374
and this is partly a consequence of 
studying archetypes for a very long 

699
00:44:40,531 --> 00:44:41,364
period of time,
I think the fundamental question that's 

700
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:45,114
on the very outer reaches of the 
hierarchy that's associated with ethics 

701
00:44:48,961 --> 00:44:49,794
and morality is,
are you trying to make the world a 

702
00:44:51,361 --> 00:44:55,440
better place or a worse place?
And I believe that every time you make a

703
00:44:55,441 --> 00:44:58,380
decision when you could go one way or 
you could go another,

704
00:44:58,381 --> 00:44:59,214
that in some sense you're acting out 
your conviction in relationship to that 

705
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:06,120
highest order question.
No one you say,

706
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:06,954
well,
would people really work to make the 

707
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:10,740
world a worse place?
And the answer to that is,

708
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:12,390
well,
if you have to ask that question,

709
00:45:12,391 --> 00:45:15,180
then you should open your eyes because 
we know the answer to that.

710
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:19,860
The old 20th century was full of have 
decades and decades.

711
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:21,000
In fact,
the primary,

712
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,420
I think the primary,

713
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,573
the most important information that you 
can derive from an analysis of the 20th 

714
00:45:31,431 --> 00:45:32,264
centuries that is pretty damn certain 
that people are willing to work to make 

715
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:36,980
everything as terrible as they possibly 
can.

716
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:42,140
And that's definitely worth considering 
because if people are willing to do that

717
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,093
and motivated to do that,
that probably means that you're willing 

718
00:45:45,411 --> 00:45:46,244
to do that motivated to do it too,
and I think it's fairly easy to 

719
00:45:49,101 --> 00:45:49,934
understand why.
I think the reason that people are 

720
00:45:51,951 --> 00:45:52,784
motivated to do that sort of thing is to
do terrible things is because they're 

721
00:45:56,361 --> 00:46:00,230
angry at the conditions of their life.
They're angry at the conditions of being

722
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:05,500
because being is is composed of 
suffering and vulnerability and people.

723
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:07,243
People lose and they suffer and they get
resentful and angry about that and they 

724
00:46:10,161 --> 00:46:10,994
feel hard done by and that the entire 
structure of the world is aimed against 

725
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:15,314
them in some unfair manner and then they
get resentful and corrupt and feel that 

726
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:22,100
everything that they do is justifiable.

727
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,820
Given how much torment and suffering 
they've been living through and from.

728
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:28,910
Once you make the.
Once you move into that particular realm

729
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:29,744
of thinking,
your ability to start to make things 

730
00:46:32,061 --> 00:46:34,580
worse starts to accelerate 
exponentially.

731
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:35,743
And I don't believe there's a single 
person on the planet who hasn't been in 

732
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:38,894
a situation where something has happened
to them that sufficiently disappointing 

733
00:46:42,381 --> 00:46:46,460
and tragic so that their thoughts turned
to revenge and destruction.

734
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:50,570
Think that harms to people all the time 
and it's understandable,

735
00:46:50,571 --> 00:46:51,404
but the problem is it seems to be 
extraordinarily counterproductive and 

736
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:55,244
all it does is make the situation that 
everybody's complaining about worse 

737
00:46:57,951 --> 00:46:58,784
instead of better.
And so what seems to be the cases that 

738
00:47:01,881 --> 00:47:05,300
you have to bear the fact that you're 
incomplete and,

739
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:06,493
and I'm vulnerable and underdeveloped in
and weak in many ways without becoming 

740
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,610
vengeful and corrupted by your knowledge
of that and,

741
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:18,830
and well still trying to do everything 
you can to make the,

742
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,230
to make being better rather than worse.

743
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,433
And

744
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,660
I think the upside of that mode of 
thinking is I don't believe that there's

745
00:47:28,661 --> 00:47:29,494
anything more engaging and interesting 
then continued attempts to make things 

746
00:47:33,161 --> 00:47:36,280
better.
A problem is it requires the adoption of

747
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:38,320
a tremendous amount of responsibility.
Right?

748
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:39,203
And I think that it's the unwillingness 
to accept responsibility that stops 

749
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:45,340
people from waking up and becoming 
enlightened.

750
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,113
No,
if if you want to make the world a 

751
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:50,530
better place,
then you have to take responsibility for

752
00:47:50,531 --> 00:47:51,364
all of the.
All of the ways that you look at the 

753
00:47:52,571 --> 00:47:53,404
world and everything that you act out 
and all the things that you say and it 

754
00:47:58,151 --> 00:48:01,090
means you have to pay a tremendous 
amount of attention to what you're doing

755
00:48:01,091 --> 00:48:02,500
as a consequence.
And that's,

756
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,753
that's very difficult and it's also 
frightening because it means that you 

757
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:07,504
have to entertain the hypothesis that 
the things that you're doing are 

758
00:48:10,271 --> 00:48:11,104
important.

759
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:12,523
Am I think part of the reason why?
Why our culture has taken such a 

760
00:48:15,761 --> 00:48:16,594
nihilistic Bantus because people have 
actually decided that life would be a 

761
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:21,640
lot easier if it didn't have any 
meaning.

762
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:23,403
People run around and complain about the
fact that life is meaninglessness or 

763
00:48:27,131 --> 00:48:29,850
that life is meaningless and we've,
you know,

764
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,693
we've drawn that conclusion from both a 
rational and empirical perspective and 

765
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:34,563
people will tell you that they came to 
that conclusion purely logically and 

766
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:39,880
scientifically.
But when I looked at that claim,

767
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:40,570
might think,
well,

768
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:43,540
maybe you want life to be beating list 
because it lets you off the hook.

769
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,150
If everything you do hasn't gotten any 
value,

770
00:48:46,151 --> 00:48:47,980
then why do you have to pay any 
attention to it?

771
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:52,030
You can do whatever you want and if it's
the opposite,

772
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:54,370
if everything you do has meaning and 
it's important,

773
00:48:54,371 --> 00:48:58,570
well then you better be awake because 
what you do matters and then you get all

774
00:48:58,571 --> 00:49:00,700
the meaning you want at the price you 
have to pay for.

775
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:01,533
That is that you have to take 
responsibility now and if you start to 

776
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:08,140
seriously entertain the idea that with 
every decision you take,

777
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,440
you're tilting the world either towards 
heaven or towards hell.

778
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:16,030
Then that can instantly start making you
a lot more serious about what you choose

779
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:18,610
to do and not do.
And My.

780
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:19,893
My understanding of personality 
development and personality development 

781
00:49:22,661 --> 00:49:26,620
in relationship to history is that that 
is exactly what is the case.

782
00:49:26,621 --> 00:49:28,330
When you're making decisions in your 
life,

783
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:29,523
you face a a field of infinite potential
and you use your will for good or evil 

784
00:49:35,021 --> 00:49:37,360
in order to shape it into what it's 
going to be.

785
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,153
And that's really what a human being is.
A human being is the sort of creature 

786
00:49:41,531 --> 00:49:43,960
that can do that.
And you know,

787
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:48,370
one of the things I've found,
it's extremely interesting is that there

788
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,660
is an idea at the very core of most 
modern legal systems.

789
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,640
It's certainly the case for English 
common law,

790
00:49:54,641 --> 00:49:57,970
which I think is the most sophisticated 
legal system that's ever been developed.

791
00:49:57,971 --> 00:50:02,800
And it's predicated on an idea that 
every single person has intrinsic worth,

792
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,113
you know,
that sort of the ground of the idea of 

793
00:50:05,141 --> 00:50:05,974
natural rights.
And so I spend a lot of time looking 

794
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:13,051
into that idea is why is it that,
why is it that the idea that each person

795
00:50:13,481 --> 00:50:14,314
has intrinsic worth ever developed,
especially when you look at the 

796
00:50:17,111 --> 00:50:19,180
situation and you see that,
well,

797
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:20,014
some people are clearly doing everything
they can to make the world as an 

798
00:50:23,171 --> 00:50:25,600
absolutely terrible place.
You know,

799
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:26,613
under English common law for example,
even if you're a serial killer and 

800
00:50:29,241 --> 00:50:32,330
everyone knows it,
you still have rights before the law.

801
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,390
And there's an idea there that no matter
how corrupt you've become,

802
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:38,150
there's still something that's 
intrinsically valuable about you.

803
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,433
And you know,
people in the modern world claim that 

804
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:43,910
they don't have any metaphysical 
beliefs.

805
00:50:43,911 --> 00:50:48,911
But in so far as you're an advocate of 
the legal system that claims that people

806
00:50:49,521 --> 00:50:50,354
have intrinsic worth,
then you're acting out the idea that 

807
00:50:52,641 --> 00:50:57,350
there's something of value about every 
single person and then you might ask,

808
00:50:57,351 --> 00:50:58,184
well,
what is it that might be a value of 

809
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:04,661
every single person and if it's,
it might easily be that it's the faculty

810
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:07,880
that each person has to turn potential 
into actuality.

811
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,153
And I would say that if you do an 
analysis of the fundamental basis of 

812
00:51:13,011 --> 00:51:13,844
modern law then and you and you and you 
go down into the understructure of the 

813
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:22,520
ideas that gave rise to that entire body
of law.

814
00:51:22,521 --> 00:51:25,520
What you find is that is the idea at the
bottom of it.

815
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:26,973
No,
what's the idea in some sense that 

816
00:51:27,891 --> 00:51:28,724
people are made in the image of God and 
it's God who makes order out of chaos 

817
00:51:32,661 --> 00:51:33,494
and sometimes turns chaos into and 
sometimes turns order into chaos when 

818
00:51:37,311 --> 00:51:40,160
that becomes necessary and people are 
capable of doing that.

819
00:51:40,161 --> 00:51:40,994
So I think that we're continually 
involved in the cocreation of reality 

820
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:48,860
and that we can choose what sort of 
reality we want to bring into existence.

821
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:50,983
So when you can do that in a resentful 
and murderous way and you have every 

822
00:51:53,631 --> 00:51:54,464
reason to do it,
but it seems to me to be the wrong 

823
00:51:56,511 --> 00:51:59,460
choice and you'll pay a big price for 
doing that.

824
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:02,060
You pay a big price for doing that every
second of your life.

825
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,500
The things that I've been talking to you
about for the entire course,

826
00:52:23,501 --> 00:52:24,334
you know,
there are things that I've tried to put 

827
00:52:25,031 --> 00:52:27,760
into practice in one way or another.
You know,

828
00:52:27,761 --> 00:52:31,420
when I'm,
when I'm engaged in therapy with people,

829
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:34,960
what I'm really trying to do is to 
listen to what they have to say.

830
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:36,303
No,
I don't.

831
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:39,760
I don't really want to give them advice 
because the advice isn't that helpful.

832
00:52:39,761 --> 00:52:44,290
But usually what we try to do is we've 
tried to lay out what the problem is.

833
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:45,153
You know,
and that's a consequence of mutual 

834
00:52:46,811 --> 00:52:50,020
discussion because often people don't 
really know why they're troubled.

835
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,153
You know,
they have some ideas about it and they 

836
00:52:52,781 --> 00:52:53,614
can talk about the situation in their 
family and the fact that their 

837
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:57,400
relationships aren't going well and so 
forth,

838
00:52:57,401 --> 00:52:58,234
but it's no easy matter to actually 
specify the problem because if things 

839
00:53:01,301 --> 00:53:02,134
aren't going well for you,
it's not necessarily the case that you 

840
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:07,180
know why you might know some of it.

841
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:10,810
You might even know that there's some 
things that you're doing that you should

842
00:53:10,811 --> 00:53:13,180
stop doing,
but you can't stop doing them.

843
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:18,130
So a lot of the initial discussion is 
mirrored delineation of what the problem

844
00:53:18,131 --> 00:53:21,340
constitutes and then the next part of 
the discussion as well.

845
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,790
If that's the problem,
what would a solution look like?

846
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:27,480
Which be how could things be better than
they are now?

847
00:53:27,481 --> 00:53:29,910
What would that,
what would that actually look like?

848
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:31,500
And then the next issue is,
well,

849
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:35,340
what steps could you put into place to 
start moving towards that goal?

850
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:39,370
And that's all an exploratory process.
You know,

851
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:40,213
and I think it's a process that's 
basically grounded in a search for the 

852
00:53:42,541 --> 00:53:43,374
truth.
And what I found in my psychotherapy 

853
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:51,150
practice is that in so far as that's 
happening during the discussions,

854
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:53,940
then the process itself is 
extraordinarily gripping.

855
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:55,101
You know,
when you,

856
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:55,581
you,
you,

857
00:53:55,581 --> 00:53:56,414
I think you also experienced that 
whenever you sit down with someone and 

858
00:53:59,131 --> 00:53:59,964
have a conversation that serious and 
meaningful conversation like that grips 

859
00:54:03,961 --> 00:54:04,650
you.

860
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:05,483
And I think the reason for that is 
because you are in the right place at 

861
00:54:08,971 --> 00:54:10,380
the right time,
so to speak.

862
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:12,450
And what you're doing is important and 
meaningful.

863
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:16,140
It's difficult though because you have 
to face up to what the problems actually

864
00:54:16,141 --> 00:54:16,974
are and you have to pay careful 
attention and you have to run through 

865
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:23,220
all the options and you have to plan 
strategically and you have to be careful

866
00:54:23,221 --> 00:54:26,730
about what you said.
You can't get too self aggrandizing,

867
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:27,583
Redo,
egotistical and you can't offer simple 

868
00:54:29,701 --> 00:54:33,870
solutions.
But it's an incredibly engaging process.

869
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:34,680
You know,
it's,

870
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:38,070
it's like reading the highest quality 
fiction in some sense.

871
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:41,910
And so a lot of conversations between 
people can be like that.

872
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:42,744
If both people who are engaged in the 
conversation and this is something 

873
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:48,510
Rogers pointed out,
you know,

874
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:52,980
are willing to admit that there is in 
fact the problem and then to do whatever

875
00:54:52,981 --> 00:54:57,780
is necessary to lay out the structure of
that broad meant to solve it and that's,

876
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:02,040
that's admission of vulnerability too to
a large degree.

877
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,100
And it seems to me that that process 
actually works,

878
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:07,530
you know,
it facilitates trust,

879
00:55:07,531 --> 00:55:09,450
which is extraordinarily useful.
I mean,

880
00:55:09,451 --> 00:55:10,284
with some of my clients,
it's taken me years before we can 

881
00:55:12,151 --> 00:55:17,010
actually have a genuine conversation 
because they're so afraid of engaging in

882
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:21,900
a discussion that's actually real and 
genuine and exposing their,

883
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:24,460
their actual problems that,
that,

884
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,333
you know,
they hide often behind the sorts of 

885
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:31,590
things that you described as a persona.
You can't get to the real person because

886
00:55:31,591 --> 00:55:32,424
there's so covered up by a shell that,
that you can't have a genuine 

887
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:38,004
discussion.
And the reason that's the case is 

888
00:55:39,531 --> 00:55:40,480
because,
you know,

889
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:44,250
they've attempted to engage in genuine 
interactions with people in the past and

890
00:55:44,251 --> 00:55:46,770
they've been betrayed or hurt or 
undermined in some way.

891
00:55:46,771 --> 00:55:47,604
That's really profound.
And so they learned that that's very 

892
00:55:49,741 --> 00:55:52,020
dangerous to do that,
which is exactly true,

893
00:55:52,021 --> 00:55:54,510
but it's a lot more dangerous not to do 
it.

894
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,013
So

895
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:06,423
one of the things that I hope for when I
teach this class and the other classes 

896
00:56:09,131 --> 00:56:09,964
that I teach too,
is that people can come out of the 

897
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:12,933
classes with a different 
conceptualization of what they might 

898
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:17,930
actually be like.
No.

899
00:56:17,931 --> 00:56:21,040
And I really do believe that people are 
remarkable creatures,

900
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:24,520
know the extent of our capacity by no 
means known.

901
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:27,370
And there's so much about what we're 
like that we don't understand.

902
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:31,720
We have no idea what it means that each 
of us is a locus of consciousness.

903
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:34,450
You know,
and obviously,

904
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:36,490
you know,
I don't know if you know this,

905
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:40,180
but the word genie is the root word of 
genius.

906
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,510
And the idea of the GE is a very 
interesting idea,

907
00:56:43,511 --> 00:56:44,344
right?
Because with a genie you have this 

908
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:50,110
incredible capacity for magical power in
some sense,

909
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:53,290
all collapsed into this incredibly tiny 
container.

910
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:54,323
And so there's this weird constraint 
between the divine possibility of the 

911
00:56:57,431 --> 00:56:58,264
genie and the fact that it's 
encapsulated into this unbearably tiny 

912
00:57:01,571 --> 00:57:02,140
space.

913
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:02,973
And in some senses trapped inside that,
but the reason that genie is the root 

914
00:57:06,671 --> 00:57:09,670
word of genius is because that's exactly
what people are like,

915
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:10,973
that we have this incredible capacity 
for imagination and for speaking things 

916
00:57:14,081 --> 00:57:16,450
into being and for acting things into 
being.

917
00:57:16,451 --> 00:57:17,284
But at the same time,
we're limited by our frame in time and 

918
00:57:21,011 --> 00:57:22,270
space.
It limits us,

919
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:26,500
but it also allows us potential.
It's a very strange set of limitations.

920
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:31,310
One of the things I've wondered very 
deeply over the last 20 years is,

921
00:57:31,311 --> 00:57:32,144
you know,
that people are often upset about the 

922
00:57:34,991 --> 00:57:35,824
structure of being.
There's a good argument in the brothers 

923
00:57:38,501 --> 00:57:40,260
Karamazov,
um,

924
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:44,640
they,
the brothers Karamazov features a very,

925
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:45,503
a very large number of characters that 
has a very Friday and eat a whole 

926
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:50,740
subplot.
But one of the,

927
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:52,023
one of the continual battles between 
characters in the brothers Karamazov is 

928
00:57:55,151 --> 00:57:55,984
a battle between a young man named 
Elisha who is going to be a monk in a 

929
00:57:59,651 --> 00:58:03,730
monastery and he's trying to live a 
classically good life.

930
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:04,031
You know,
uh,

931
00:58:04,031 --> 00:58:07,710
traditionally good life as it might've 
been conceived of in 18,

932
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:10,930
18 and 18 seventies.
And his brother Ivan,

933
00:58:10,931 --> 00:58:13,180
who is an older brother who's extremely 
intelligent,

934
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:14,023
charismatic,
and very rationalistic and arrogant and 

935
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,173
and creative and intelligent.
And he likes nothing better than to go 

936
00:58:23,591 --> 00:58:24,424
after her lowest share with all the 
stories about the horrors of the world 

937
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:28,083
to try to undermine his faith in the 
divinity that he's attempting to 

938
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:31,924
establish a relationship with them.
So we tell stories like this is a story 

939
00:58:34,871 --> 00:58:35,704
that does DSD took out of the newspaper 
in approximately the time when he was 

940
00:58:40,241 --> 00:58:42,700
reading the brothers Karamazov.
And it's a story about this.

941
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:44,343
This family,
this father and mother locked there are 

942
00:58:46,331 --> 00:58:49,660
three or four year old daughter and a 
freezing out house overnight.

943
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:50,883
And she was screaming the entire time to
have someone let her out and they let 

944
00:58:54,401 --> 00:58:56,020
her freeze to death and the outhouse.

945
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,330
And of course that produced a big 
scandal.

946
00:58:58,331 --> 00:59:00,940
And one of the things that Ivan Ivan 
uses,

947
00:59:00,941 --> 00:59:01,774
that story or Dostoevsky uses that story
in the brothers Karamazov so that Ivan 

948
00:59:05,591 --> 00:59:06,424
can torture Lee Osha about the fact that
you know there's no way that you could 

949
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:10,384
possibly envision that being itself 
could be good or that God could be good 

950
00:59:13,631 --> 00:59:14,464
if you want to put it a different way 
when that sort of thing can happen in 

951
00:59:16,961 --> 00:59:20,920
the world and that it happens over and 
over and over all the time,

952
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:21,763
everywhere you know,
and and Dostoevsky because he's no 

953
00:59:24,891 --> 00:59:25,724
piker.
When he sets up an argument between two 

954
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:29,660
positions,
he sets up the argument as powerfully as

955
00:59:29,661 --> 00:59:30,494
he possibly can.
And so he has already been tell Osha 

956
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:33,463
endless stories like that and make the 
claim that as far as revenue is 

957
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:37,543
concerned,
that the mere fact that any of those 

958
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,190
things could have ever happened.

959
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:42,410
Even once.
A sufficient reason to never,

960
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:46,070
never allow yourself to conceptualize 
the idea.

961
00:59:46,071 --> 00:59:46,904
That being itself might be good fact.
Ivan's presupposition is that it's evil 

962
00:59:51,861 --> 00:59:54,740
enough so that it should be eradicated 
in one.

963
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:55,663
Any
any game that has that element of play 

964
00:59:59,901 --> 01:00:01,850
and it is a game that should never be 
played.

965
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:05,150
That's basically Ivan stance and that's 
a very.

966
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:08,150
That's a very archetipal stance by the 
way.

967
01:00:08,151 --> 01:00:10,980
It's the same stance that Mephistopheles
adoption group,

968
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,833
this faust,
and it's the same stance that Lucifer 

969
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:20,170
adopts in paradise lost.
It's the rational opposition to be a and

970
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:21,563
and it's a very powerful idea,
but there's something wrong about it 

971
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:29,570
because if you pursue that and you act 
it out rigorously and consistently,

972
01:00:29,571 --> 01:00:30,404
then all that happens is you turn into 
someone who adds to the misery rather 

973
01:00:33,771 --> 01:00:37,520
than putting an end to it and one of the
things I've wondered is,

974
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:39,770
and this is something that's worth 
thinking about.

975
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,083
If everybody abandoned their 
pathological nihilism and despair and 

976
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:45,950
did what they could to make things 
better,

977
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,784
wherever they could,
then maybe we could turn the world into 

978
01:00:48,501 --> 01:00:52,220
a place where that sort of thing didn't 
happen and then what?

979
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:54,260
Then what would that be like?
No,

980
01:00:54,261 --> 01:00:55,094
because you ask yourself why have you 
done everything you possibly can to put 

981
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:01,190
your life in order?
And if the answer to that is no,

982
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:02,024
then what makes you think you have any 
right to complain about the conditions 

983
01:01:04,281 --> 01:01:08,420
of your existence?
There's a story in Tsl.

984
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,273
Iots play the cocktail hour and the 
story involves a woman who's thinking 

985
01:01:13,281 --> 01:01:14,114
about seeking psychiatric treatment and 
she approaches a psychiatrist and she 

986
01:01:17,931 --> 01:01:18,764
basically says,
I really hope there's something wrong 

987
01:01:20,901 --> 01:01:23,360
with me.
And the psychiatrist says,

988
01:01:23,361 --> 01:01:24,194
well,
why do you hope that there's something 

989
01:01:24,891 --> 01:01:26,450
wrong with you?
And she says,

990
01:01:26,451 --> 01:01:27,284
well,
I'm having a really miserable time of 

991
01:01:28,491 --> 01:01:29,150
it.

992
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:29,983
And as far as I can tell,
that means that there's only two 

993
01:01:31,641 --> 01:01:32,474
options.
Either I'm doing something wrong and 

994
01:01:34,311 --> 01:01:35,144
there's something wrong with me and 
that's the reason that all this 

995
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:39,200
pointless suffering seems to be 
occurring.

996
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:43,430
Or there's something wrong with the 
structure of being per se that makes all

997
01:01:43,431 --> 01:01:45,200
of this inevitable,
you know?

998
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:48,710
And that's a perfectly reasonable laying
out of two options.

999
01:01:48,711 --> 01:01:49,670
And so she says,
well,

1000
01:01:49,671 --> 01:01:50,504
I hope that we can start to discover 
what it is that I'm doing wrong because 

1001
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:57,590
it would be a lot better if the reason 
things weren't so good was because I was

1002
01:01:57,591 --> 01:01:58,424
doing something wrong.
Then it would be if the reason that 

1003
01:02:00,531 --> 01:02:01,364
things are wrong is because they're just
wrong and there's nothing you can do 

1004
01:02:03,711 --> 01:02:05,300
about it.
Well,

1005
01:02:05,301 --> 01:02:08,450
it's an easy question to answer because 
that's an existential question.

1006
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:09,303
You know,
what's the sort of thing that you can 

1007
01:02:09,921 --> 01:02:10,754
only answer over the course of your 
entire life and it's the sort of 

1008
01:02:13,701 --> 01:02:16,400
question that no one else can answer for
you,

1009
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:17,563
but one thing you can find out is just 
what your life would be like if you 

1010
01:02:20,731 --> 01:02:23,130
stopped making it unnecessarily 
miserable.

1011
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,593
You know when to do that.
You have to abandon your 

1012
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:27,473
dissatisfaction,
your vengefulness and your resentment 

1013
01:02:29,671 --> 01:02:33,600
and your arrogance and your willful 
blindness and all those things that stop

1014
01:02:33,601 --> 01:02:34,434
you from seeing what's right in front of
your face and try to make things as 

1015
01:02:36,871 --> 01:02:40,470
straight as you possibly can in those 
places that you can make them.

1016
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,053
And as far as I can tell if you do that,
I think it's what I teach my clients to 

1017
01:02:46,951 --> 01:02:49,530
do in psychotherapy.
If they do that,

1018
01:02:49,531 --> 01:02:50,364
their lives get a lot better and I don't
know exactly how good your life could 

1019
01:02:54,181 --> 01:02:55,014
get,
but I don't think that there's any 

1020
01:02:55,951 --> 01:03:00,951
necessary upper limit so people can 
figure out how to set things right.

1021
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:02,101
And the,
you know,

1022
01:03:02,101 --> 01:03:06,360
the more you practice that in the places
you can actually practice it,

1023
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:09,630
the better and better you get at that in
the more things that you can set.

1024
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:11,100
Right.
You know,

1025
01:03:11,101 --> 01:03:13,200
and then you're also not setting other 
people.

1026
01:03:13,201 --> 01:03:14,034
Right.
Which I also think there's something 

1027
01:03:15,361 --> 01:03:16,194
extremely useful because my suspicions 
are that you have enough to do just 

1028
01:03:19,261 --> 01:03:20,094
setting yourself right without having to
worry about all the other people that 

1029
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:24,570
are running around mocking up the 
planet,

1030
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,273
which,
and you don't know what to do with them 

1031
01:03:27,161 --> 01:03:27,994
many ways or what they should be doing.
So it's just as well to start with 

1032
01:03:30,961 --> 01:03:31,794
yourself.
It's an extremely useful adventure and 

1033
01:03:34,861 --> 01:03:39,630
it's something that will never allow you
to become board even for a moment.

1034
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:42,120
And that's worth something to,
you know,

1035
01:03:42,121 --> 01:03:42,954
because even if life is fundamentally 
suffering and there's nothing that can 

1036
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:48,270
be done about that,
which is a possibility,

1037
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,433
there's always the possibility that you 
could learn to live in a manner so that 

1038
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:56,310
that suffering was actually justifiable 
even to you because you might say,

1039
01:03:56,311 --> 01:03:57,144
well,
what I'm doing is so much worthwhile 

1040
01:03:58,321 --> 01:03:59,154
that even if I have to suffer to do it,
it's worth it and I would say that's 

1041
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:02,693
actually the ethical imperative for your
life is that you're obliged to find 

1042
01:04:07,741 --> 01:04:11,550
something to do and some way of doing it
that's so deeply meaningful,

1043
01:04:11,551 --> 01:04:12,384
but the fact that you have to carry 
around your mortal vulnerability is 

1044
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:18,690
something that you can accept and even 
be happy about.

1045
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:25,230
Because the alternative is gloomy and DM
and it's worse than that.

1046
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:26,103
It's not just gloomy and DMD.
It's gloomy and dam and then it's 

1047
01:04:28,751 --> 01:04:30,880
beneficial and then it's murderous.
And Ben,

1048
01:04:30,881 --> 01:04:31,714
it's genocidal and that seems to be 
something that we could really do 

1049
01:04:35,261 --> 01:04:36,094
without.

1050
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:41,040
So I'm hoping that as a consequence of 
having taken this course,

1051
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:41,874
that you have some expanded idea of what
it might mean to be a human being and 

1052
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:46,464
that you can carry that with you as you 
move forward in your life and find out 

1053
01:04:49,921 --> 01:04:50,754
what you really liked and find out what 
you could do if you put your mind to it 

1054
01:04:53,581 --> 01:04:57,000
because God only knows what you could do
if you put your mind to it,

1055
01:04:57,990 --> 01:04:59,880
you know,
and the more people who are doing that,

1056
01:04:59,881 --> 01:05:00,714
the better things are going to get.
And that would be a good thing because 

1057
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:06,180
things aren't so bad,
but they could be a lot better.

1058
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:10,410
And it's hard to say just exactly how 
much you could contribute to that.

1059
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:14,070
If you decided that that's what it was 
that you could do,

1060
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,620
and I do believe that is what you can 
do.

1061
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:17,663
I also believe that you are doing that.
You're shaping the world for better or 

1062
01:05:22,211 --> 01:05:23,044
for worse,
regardless of whether or not you decide 

1063
01:05:25,061 --> 01:05:29,620
to do it and take on the responsibility.
You're basically destined to do that.

1064
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:31,293
So it seems to me that you should make 
that conscious and decide if you're 

1065
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:37,360
going to do it properly or if you're 
going to make things worse.

1066
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:39,653
So.

1067
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:49,800
Well,
I guess the other thing I have to say is

1068
01:05:49,801 --> 01:05:54,150
that I wish you luck as you proceed 
through your university career.

1069
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:57,780
I mean this is an awkward institution in
many ways and your,

1070
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:01,740
your faceless and numbered while you're 
here,

1071
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:03,053
but it's also a place where it's the 
fact that you're engaged in this 

1072
01:06:06,961 --> 01:06:07,794
university means that the social 
community has given you an identity 

1073
01:06:10,621 --> 01:06:14,160
that's acceptable.
You're a student and that's an honorable

1074
01:06:14,161 --> 01:06:14,994
thing to be.
And that means that you can spend a few 

1075
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,233
years trying to learn the most important
things that you have to learn and that 

1076
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:21,653
you're,
you're granted a role that makes that 

1077
01:06:24,421 --> 01:06:26,880
acceptable.
Unjustifiable and I would say,

1078
01:06:26,881 --> 01:06:28,680
well,
you've got a couple of years here,

1079
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:31,950
you know,
and the wisdom of the world is collected

1080
01:06:31,951 --> 01:06:32,784
at the University of Toronto and it's 
going to be discussed and displayed 

1081
01:06:36,361 --> 01:06:37,194
awkwardly by your professors because 
they're incomplete incarnations of 

1082
01:06:41,461 --> 01:06:42,600
historical wisdom.

1083
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:47,310
But you should forgive them for that and
try to do everything you possibly can to

1084
01:06:47,311 --> 01:06:51,300
extract everything you possibly can out 
of this place while you're here.

1085
01:06:51,301 --> 01:06:52,134
Because if you do it properly,
then it's going to make your life a lot 

1086
01:06:54,931 --> 01:06:57,360
richer and more productive than it could
otherwise be.

1087
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:58,650
And you might say,
well,

1088
01:06:58,651 --> 01:07:01,470
what about getting a job?
And I would say,

1089
01:07:01,471 --> 01:07:02,304
well,
if you learn to think and you learn to 

1090
01:07:03,661 --> 01:07:04,494
speak and you learn to act properly and 
you learn how to be articulate and you 

1091
01:07:08,251 --> 01:07:11,040
conduct yourself with a certain amount 
of wisdom and grace,

1092
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,053
you'll never have to worry for one 
minute in your life about what you're 

1093
01:07:14,311 --> 01:07:17,100
going to do that will sustain you and be
productive.

1094
01:07:17,101 --> 01:07:17,934
Because people like that are an 
unbelievably short supply and all the 

1095
01:07:21,721 --> 01:07:22,554
people out there in the world who have 
some sense and there's quite a few 

1096
01:07:25,021 --> 01:07:28,860
people like that are desperately looking
for people like that.

1097
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:32,370
And if you happen to be one of them,
you will have more opportunities in your

1098
01:07:32,371 --> 01:07:34,590
life than you possibly know what to do 
with.

1099
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,113
So I don't think you have to worry too 
much about exactly what you're going to 

1100
01:07:39,001 --> 01:07:41,250
be or what role you're going to play 
when you come out.

1101
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:42,323
If you prepare yourself and you turn 
yourself into an articulate and honest 

1102
01:07:45,331 --> 01:07:46,164
and educated person.
People like that are incredibly 

1103
01:07:48,751 --> 01:07:51,510
valuable.
And as I said already,

1104
01:07:51,511 --> 01:07:54,510
if you transform yourself into someone 
who's like that,

1105
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:57,960
the world will open doors for you in 
ways you can't possibly imagine.

1106
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:00,570
It will happen in ways you don't even 
understand.

1107
01:08:00,571 --> 01:08:01,404
I mean,
I see this with students who do the 

1108
01:08:03,031 --> 01:08:04,920
opposite,
you know,

1109
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:08,940
so with my graduate students and 
sometimes with undergraduates as well,

1110
01:08:08,941 --> 01:08:11,390
I'll give one of them a job to do,
you know,

1111
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:12,503
and they'll either do it and do it well,
are there come back and tell me why it 

1112
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:16,724
was impossible for,
for them to do it and how many things 

1113
01:08:18,621 --> 01:08:19,460
got in the way.

1114
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:20,713
And the consequences of that is that for
the person who comes and tells me that 

1115
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,273
they don't get another opportunity and 
for the person who comes and does and 

1116
01:08:28,341 --> 01:08:32,420
has done what I asked them to do,
or maybe going over and above the,

1117
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:34,850
you know,
the call of duty,

1118
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:35,863
then I have six more opportunities for 
them or maybe 20 more opportunities for 

1119
01:08:39,231 --> 01:08:40,064
them or maybe 50 more opportunities for 
them because I have more opportunities 

1120
01:08:42,711 --> 01:08:43,544
that I know what to do with.
And so it turns out that if you're the 

1121
01:08:46,101 --> 01:08:48,770
sort of person who is useful and direct 
and honest,

1122
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:51,770
then invisible doors will open for you 
everywhere.

1123
01:08:51,771 --> 01:08:52,604
And if you're not,
then invisible doors will shut until no 

1124
01:08:55,641 --> 01:08:56,474
doors are open and you'll think you'll 
curse fate for that and complaint about 

1125
01:09:00,051 --> 01:09:02,810
the structure of being.
But the reason it's like that is because

1126
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:04,003
you didn't take the opportunities when 
they were offered to you and you didn't 

1127
01:09:07,011 --> 01:09:08,090
do things properly.

1128
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:10,003
So you can learn how to do things 
properly at university and you can turn 

1129
01:09:14,331 --> 01:09:18,050
yourself into someone who's a lot wiser 
than you were when you first came here.

1130
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:21,230
And there isn't anything that's more 
valuable than wisdom and truth,

1131
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:24,770
and so I would say you take the next 
couple of years while you're here.

1132
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:25,843
See if you can turn yourself into 
something that's useful and honest and 

1133
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:30,920
you'll be so prepared for life,
you won't be able to believe it,

1134
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,083
and there's absolutely no reason to be 
cynical about that because I seen how 

1135
01:09:35,361 --> 01:09:37,490
the world works and that is how it 
works.

1136
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:39,013
So.
So I wish you well while you attempt to 

1137
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,290
do that.
And I hope that you've learned something

1138
01:09:45,291 --> 01:09:46,124
in this course that enables you to do 
that in a manner that's more powerful 

1139
01:09:50,131 --> 01:09:50,964
than richer and more worthwhile and less
nihilistic and less cynical and more 

1140
01:09:55,281 --> 01:09:58,280
meaningful because that would be a good 
thing if it happened.

1141
01:09:58,880 --> 01:09:59,713
And so it was a pleasure to teach you 
this year and I wish you the best of 

1142
01:10:02,871 --> 01:10:04,850
luck as you proceed through your 
education.

1143
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:11,100
Thank you.
