00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,463
Hi,
this is an invitation to Dutch citizens 

2
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:04,944
and their leaders alike.
I'm coming to Holland next week for two 

3
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:09,804
reasons,
apart from the fact that I love Holland 

4
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,010
and I'm always looking for an excuse to 
go there.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,930
First on January 17th from 10:00 AM to 
7:30 PM.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,180
I'm going to talk to corporate and other
organizational leaders in Amsterdam in a

7
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:25,014
session entitled envisioning the future 
at the warehouse by wicked grounds in 

8
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:30,444
Amsterdam.
Details of the session can be found in 

9
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:33,774
the description of this video as can 
information about tickets which are 

10
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:37,374
still available.
I'm going to begin the day with a 

11
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:43,320
lecture on the psychology of motivation 
and emotion.

12
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:44,154
I want to discuss deeply from the 
symbolic level all the way down to the 

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,030
level of of neuroscience,
how it is that vision and motivation and

14
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:54,354
the regulation of emotion or deeply 
entwined in that the vision that we set 

15
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:02,730
for ourselves defines the framework 
within which we operate in the world,

16
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,210
perceive the world and react emotionally
to the world.

17
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,283
I want to help everyone who comes to the
session understand exactly what that 

18
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:16,980
means in the most modern and uptodate 
psychological manner possible,

19
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:19,440
and so all lecture for about 90 minutes 
about that,

20
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:20,274
perhaps a bit longer after that,
participants will have the opportunity 

21
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:26,274
to complete the future authoring program
or at least to begin the future 

22
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:29,994
authoring program,
which is an online reading program that 

23
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:32,154
I designed with my colleagues that 
enables people to deeply conceptualize 

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,560
their lives three to five years down the
road and to make a plan,

25
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,610
let's say,
to maximize the quality of their life.

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,480
You began the future authoring program 
which is available publicly by the way,

27
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,493
at cell faltering Dotcom.
You begin the future authoring program 

28
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:56,010
by considering the most important 
dimensions of your life,

29
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,210
family,
friends,

30
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,073
intimate relationships,
ambitions for the future from an 

31
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:01,494
economic perspective,
use of time outside of work and the 

32
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:07,530
regulation of temptations like drug and 
alcohol use,

33
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:10,980
and imagine yourself three to five years
down the road.

34
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,203
If you are living the life that would be
optimal for you most meaningful and 

35
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:19,980
productive life.
Then you're asked to contemplate each of

36
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:22,980
those dimensions to decide how you would
optimize your life,

37
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:23,814
specifically along those dimensions,
then to write for 15 minutes about what 

38
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:27,624
your life could be like in three to five
years if you were really taking care of 

39
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:32,580
yourself like someone that you cared 
for.

40
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,713
Then to write for 20 minutes about what 
your life would be like if your bad 

41
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:40,290
habits and and inadequacies and 
characterological flaws,

42
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,570
got the upper hand and lead you into the
ground.

43
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,790
Then to write out a detailed plan for 
the attainment of your goals,

44
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:51,240
your the,
the realization of your vision,

45
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,853
including writing about why it would be 
good for you to undertake this 

46
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,350
adventure,
let's say,

47
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,710
and also why it would be good for your 
family and the broader community,

48
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:10,540
so to fully articulate a plan that will 
comprise the contents of that day.

49
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:15,010
Details about the event can be found in 
the description of this video as well as

50
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:19,450
a timeline for the day and information 
about where you can pick,

51
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,220
pick up tickets which are still 
available.

52
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,430
The second event on January 19th is 
hosted by a Dutch organization.

53
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:29,410
Netherland.
Say Leo,

54
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,753
they've organized what they hope will be
the beginning of a serious national 

55
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:37,960
conversation about Dutch and European 
identity as well as immigration policy.

56
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,063
I'm going to begin the event which will 
involve 2000 people and the number of 

57
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:45,490
well known speakers from a variety of 
backgrounds.

58
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,503
I'll start with a 45 minute discussion 
on the psychology of identity and 

59
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:54,020
concentrate more specifically on on 
Europe.

60
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,140
Where are we in Europe?
Broadly speaking,

61
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,970
how did we get here?
What have we done right and wrong?

62
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,223
Where are we going and why and how 
should each of us conduct ourselves so 

63
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:06,724
we get there.

64
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,300
How should each of us conduct ourselves 
so that are stable and productive?

65
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:13,370
Society state,
stable,

66
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,533
productive and free,
and don't fall prey to the temptations 

67
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,560
of radicalism either on the left or the 
right.

68
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,670
I hope to initiate a process of deep 
thought during this meeting,

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,833
the organizer.
So we're hoping to generate 25 

70
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:29,204
recommendations as a consequence of this
meeting for the future of Dutch and I 

71
00:04:32,811 --> 00:04:36,590
suppose more broadly European and 
Western society and there are still some

72
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:37,424
tickets available to this event.
So I'll also provide the information 

73
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:42,680
about that in the description of this 
video.

74
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:43,843
So thank you very much.
I hope to see you there if you're 

75
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:48,470
interested,
and

76
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,960
that's all I have to say about that.
Bye Bye.
