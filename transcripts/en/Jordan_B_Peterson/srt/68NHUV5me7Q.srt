00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,430
Welcome everyone and thank you for 
coming to this a forum this morning.

2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,050
Uh,
I am David Cameron,

3
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:19,140
dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science 
at the University of Toronto.

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,540
Let me begin by saying,
uh,

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,423
that we acknowledge this land on which 
the University of Toronto operates for 

6
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:28,224
thousands of years.
That has been the traditional land of 

7
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:31,194
the Huron wind at the Seneca and most 
recently the mississaugas of the credit 

8
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:37,290
river.
Today.

9
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,124
This meeting place is still the home to 
many indigenous people from across 

10
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:46,260
turtle island and we are grateful for 
the opportunity to live and work on this

11
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:51,261
lab.
The goal of today's forum is to help the

12
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:56,661
university community and interested 
members of our society to understand the

13
00:00:57,511 --> 00:00:58,344
gender provisions and implications of 
Bill [inaudible] and the Ontario Human 

14
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,480
Rights Code.
The Federal Bill See 16 passed yesterday

15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,980
as it happens in the House of Commons.
As most of you will know,

16
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,083
this matter has been a subject of 
intense controversy within the 

17
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:15,564
university and beyond.
Our aim in holding the form is to 

18
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:21,534
provide the opportunity for academic 
discussion of the matter and a serious 

19
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,510
exploration of the issues in play.

20
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,243
We ask everyone to engage with the 
issues and with one another in a spirit 

21
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:34,853
of civility and respect,
upholding in the words of the 

22
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:40,020
university's policy on the disruption of
meetings,

23
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,970
the principles of freedom of speech and 
the freedom of individuals and groups to

24
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:49,020
be free of physical intimidation and 
harassment.

25
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,300
Today's forum is being live streamed.

00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:06,574
by Professor Mayo Moran,
the provost and Vice Chancellor of the

including a book on the reasonable 
person published by Oxford University 

76
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:25,174
press.
She is currently writing about the 

77
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:27,724
problem of the past for Provost Moran 
has done policy work on issues ranging 

78
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:38,281
from how to protect public participation

sexual violence and residential schools.
She teaches a course called 10 cases 

80
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:46,360
about the,
uh,

81
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,770
10 cases that change the world.
It's of course I'd like to take that was

82
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:55,300
recently listed by Maclean's magazine as
one of u of t's cool courses.

83
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,430
I thought.
Cool is old,

84
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,750
old fashioned now,
but they,

85
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,863
uh,
the Faculty of Arts and science at the 

86
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,293
University of Toronto in is very 
grateful to all of the panelists for 

87
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:09,620
agreeing to take part in this morning's 
forum.

88
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,083
And I would like now to call on 
Professor Moron to briefly describe the 

89
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:15,490
format of today's

90
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,260
discussion.
Professor,

91
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,140
thank you very much Dean Cameron and 
welcome to everyone.

92
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,280
I have a little bit of Laryngitis,
so please excuse me if my voice isn't as

93
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:36,380
strong as usual.
Um,

94
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,880
this forum,
as you know,

95
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,753
uh,
today is designed as an academic 

96
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,050
discussion as Dean Cameron said on 
issues arising out of the current debate

97
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,913
on the provisions of Bill See 16 and the
gender provisions of the Ontario Human 

98
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,080
Rights Code.

99
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,300
Okay.

100
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,133
Critically examining and in our hope 
illuminating the great policy issues of 

101
00:06:57,761 --> 00:07:00,550
the day is a vital role for the 
university.

102
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,013
The university is uniquely well situated
because within the confines of the 

103
00:07:06,221 --> 00:07:09,580
university we have people as students 
would know,

104
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,563
who are experts on every possible topic 
and who have devoted their lives to 

105
00:07:14,711 --> 00:07:15,544
understanding those topics.
So the university is probably the best 

106
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:21,200
possible place,
uh,

107
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,053
to debate the great issues of the day,
the issues that are causing controversy 

108
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,380
and discussion and to critically 
examine,

109
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,263
uh,
the public arguments in light of fact 

110
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,853
and reason.
And that is the spirit in which we 

111
00:07:34,751 --> 00:07:35,584
gather here today.
So thank you for joining us and thank 

112
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:39,160
you to our panelists.

113
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,630
Um,
in,

114
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,790
in doing that,
in pursuing that mission,

115
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,890
as Dean Cameron said,
uh,

116
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:48,260
we seek to further at the twin,
um,

117
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,250
principles of the University of open 
dialogue and also tolerance.

118
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,260
We acknowledge of course that sometimes 
those principles are intention with each

119
00:07:57,261 --> 00:07:58,094
other.
But respect for both is absolutely 

120
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:02,150
critical to the mission of the 
university.

121
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,883
I would like to begin by acknowledging 
that the subject matter that we're 

122
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:07,394
discussing today may be difficult and 
that audience members and indeed 

123
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,013
participants will have strong feelings 
about the subject matter that we're 

124
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:16,450
discussing.
Um,

125
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,383
we have arranged for support for anyone 
who would like it just outside the room 

126
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,153
and bearing in mind the nature of the 
discussion that we're having and our 

127
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:26,654
objectives,
which are two aluminate discuss and 

128
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:29,204
understand.
I would ask that members of the 

129
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:33,800
audience,
even if you don't agree with some of the

130
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:37,250
speakers to please allow them to voice 
their opinions.

131
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,800
There will be time for questions at the 
end.

132
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,070
Okay.

133
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,100
I now like to just say a couple of 
things about how we plan to,

134
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:44,850
um,
uh,

135
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:45,683
how we constructed the forum,
which we did a in dialogue with the 

136
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:50,190
participants.
Um,

137
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,500
so we're going to begin by,
um,

138
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,440
having,
um,

139
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,423
it'll be hundred minutes long and the 
first segment we'll discuss the 

140
00:08:58,501 --> 00:08:59,334
provisions of bill.
See 16 in the Ontario Human Rights Code 

141
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,690
and we'll focus especially on freedom of
expression and human rights law.

142
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,913
In that first segment,
we will begin with Professor Peterson 

143
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,603
who will speak for 10 minutes followed 
by Professor Cossman who will speak for 

144
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:19,290
10 minutes and we do have a timekeeper.
Can you wave your hand?

145
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,590
There we go.
Uh,

146
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,580
just to ensure we're trying to make 
sure,

147
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,200
obviously we know there's lots to say on
these topics.

148
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,153
We're going to try to make sure that 
we've divided the time up and allocated 

149
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:29,364
it as fairly as possible.
In the second segment of this 

150
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:34,104
discussion,
we're again focusing on [inaudible] on 

151
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,830
the Ontario human rights code w we'll 
focus more on academic freedom,

152
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,693
gender diversity and the implications 
for scholarship and teaching in that 

153
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:46,050
segment.

154
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:46,883
Professor Peterson will again begin and 
professor Bryson will follow and they 

155
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:53,730
will have 10 minutes each.
Following that,

156
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,593
I will have a short a period to just ask
some clarifying questions of the 

157
00:09:58,411 --> 00:09:59,244
speakers and I've agreed with the 
speaker so we'll keep our answers to 

158
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:04,254
three minutes each.
I won't ask questions that are longer 

159
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:06,894
than three minutes.
Just again in an effort to ensure that 

160
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:09,834
we have as much opportunity to air some 
of the issues that people might be 

161
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:16,500
thinking about as possible.
Following that,

162
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:19,290
we'll have 30 minutes for questions from
the audience.

163
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:24,291
You can see up here that you can email 
questions to that email address.

164
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,800
If you don't have email here.
Um,

165
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,893
we have pencil and paper and people will
go around and gather questions and then 

166
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:32,574
we'll have some people curate the 
questions and bring them back to me and 

167
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:39,570
I will ask them again in an effort to 
get as many of the issues as possible on

168
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:42,600
the table.
And the speakers have all agreed kindly.

169
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:43,434
Again,
they'll keep their answers to three 

170
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,820
minutes each.
So thank you all very much.

171
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,200
Um,
and with that,

172
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,330
um,
I would like to begin and uh,

173
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,080
I will ask a professor Peterson to 
start.

174
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,610
Thank you.
Thanks.

175
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,240
So,
um,

176
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,203
I'd like if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like the audience to do something 

177
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,733
with me.
The first thing I'd like them to do if 

178
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:08,004
you would,
is if all the women in the audience 

179
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:11,490
would stand up.
That would be much appreciated.

180
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,863
Okay.

181
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,370
Okay.
Now,

182
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,040
thank you very much.
Now perhaps all the men would stand up.

183
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,583
Okay,
good.

184
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,423
Sorry,
I did a rough count when I came in here 

185
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,540
and I might be out,
but I'm not out by March.

186
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,490
I think it's about two to one males in 
here.

187
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,930
And I thought I'd point that out because
it's,

188
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:38,764
it's kind of interesting to me because 
I'm a personality psychologist and this 

189
00:11:42,611 --> 00:11:46,570
debate is about ideas and there's a 
personality trait called openness,

190
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,463
which is associated with intellect and 
creativity and there are pronounced 

191
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:55,951
gender differences in openness such that
men are higher and intellect,

192
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:56,973
which encompasses interest in ideas and 
women are hiring is theoretics which 

193
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,240
encompasses interest in while in art and
literature and that sort of thing.

194
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:08,500
And it's partly for that reason that men
read more nonfiction and women read more

195
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:09,334
fiction.
And I just wanted to point out that 

196
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,943
there was a natural gender divide that 
occurred automatically and without 

197
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:16,744
compulsion in this particular case,
in the case of this debate and that the 

198
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:21,770
more our society,
uh,

199
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,663
enforces,
it's increasingly absurd demands for 

200
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:25,894
equity upon everyone,
the less likely it is that such natural 

201
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:30,890
divisions will be able to manifest them 
in ours,

202
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:31,803
manifest themselves in our society,
in keeping with the pronounced in deep 

203
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:36,640
differences between the genders.

204
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,630
So I just thought that makes an 
interesting initial,

205
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,610
uh,
what would you call it?

206
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,550
Real world demonstration.
So,

207
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,563
okay.
So about two months ago made these 

208
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:49,750
videos,
um,

209
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,380
I did it because I was trying to 
articulate my concerns.

210
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:54,250
Um,
um,

211
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,323
for a variety of reasons.
I've been keeping an eye on political 

212
00:12:56,921 --> 00:13:01,030
correctness for a long time and I was 
also very upset with the human resources

213
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:01,864
and Equity Department's decision to make
antiracism so-called antiracism and 

214
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:07,870
antibiose training mandatory for their 
staff,

215
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:11,830
which I regard as an unacceptable 
intrusion into their staffs,

216
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:12,664
right to their political opinion,
as well as noting that there's 

217
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:15,754
absolutely no evidence whatsoever that 
mandatory anti racism and anti bias 

218
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:21,370
training has,
it's has the impact that is claimed.

219
00:13:21,371 --> 00:13:22,204
In fact,
the empirical evidence suggests quite 

220
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:25,840
the contrary when you mandate that sort 
of thing,

221
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:27,700
you actually make more people more 
prejudiced.

222
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:33,060
It's also based on what I would say is a
rather pernicious form of pseudo science

223
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:34,654
that's being promoted by social 
psychologists to group that I have a 

224
00:13:36,701 --> 00:13:37,534
fair bit of trouble with and that's been
transformed into a kind of educational 

225
00:13:40,631 --> 00:13:43,810
fascism that has no grounding whatsoever
in the empirical literature.

226
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,720
Now,
what happened as a consequence of making

227
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:48,310
these videos was,
um,

228
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,510
was really quite unexpected to me.
There.

229
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,360
We've,
we've been trying to keep count,

230
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,690
there's been 140 print articles 
published about this,

231
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,320
whatever this is in the last two months.
And then dozens and dozens of,

232
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,183
of youtube videos and television 
interviews and radio interviews and 

233
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:07,480
demonstrations.
Millions of people have been tuning into

234
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:08,314
this online.
And so obviously something's up and I 

235
00:14:11,411 --> 00:14:12,244
can tell you that what's up isn't only a
discussion about bill see 16 and about 

236
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:17,350
gendered pronouns.
You know,

237
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:18,184
sometimes when you're having a debate or
discussion with someone that you love 

238
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:21,394
and you're having a little argument 
about something like who's going to do 

239
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:27,160
the dishes or something like that.
Or you know how it,

240
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,430
especially if you haven't been getting 
along very well with that person,

241
00:14:30,431 --> 00:14:31,264
you know how the discussion starts with 
something specific and then you start 

242
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:38,140
trading all the things that it might be 
about until you're arguing about,

243
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:38,974
you know,
the way that you behaved on your third 

244
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:41,591
date,
you know,

245
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:42,460
10 years ago.

246
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,293
And the whole underlying unresolved 
chaos of your relationship emerges 

247
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:50,500
through the little portal that was 
defined by the argument,

248
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,160
you know,
well that's what this is about.

249
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,560
So what,
what the Hell's going on here?

250
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,670
Exactly.
And why are we,

251
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,650
are we damn near at each other's 
throats?

252
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,560
Look at what happened in the United 
States a week and a half ago.

253
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,840
There's been things to talk about here 
in,

254
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:06,950
I started to try to talk about the men.
I would say that my freedom to do so was

255
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,160
rapidly infringed upon.
My career was put at risk.

256
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,383
And,
and I find this absolutely unacceptable 

257
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:16,250
because I am trying to sort this out and
believe me,

258
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,560
you know what you call people,
you can't talk to

259
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:20,923
enemies.
And if we want to divide our society 

260
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:24,914
into armed camps of enmity,
all we have to do is keep doing what 

261
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:30,074
we're doing.
And I would recommend that we don't do 

262
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:31,910
this.

263
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,000
I've studied authoritarianism for a very
long time.

264
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,133
I know what happens when things get out 
of control and it can happen 

265
00:15:38,151 --> 00:15:38,984
extraordinarily rapidly.
And I would say we're on the cusp of 

266
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:42,764
that.
And so we need to start talking and 

267
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:46,310
listening.
And when you talk,

268
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:48,410
it doesn't mean you're right.
It doesn't mean you're correct,

269
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:49,940
right?
It means you're trying to articulate and

270
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:50,774
formulate your thoughts,
like the bone headed more on that you 

271
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:53,264
are,
and you're going to stumble around 

272
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:56,750
idiotically because what the hell do you
know?

273
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:57,584
You're full of biases and you're 
ignorant than you can't speak very well 

274
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:00,674
and you're over emotional and you know 
you've got just problems that you can 

275
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:04,064
hardly even imagine that are interfering
with your ability to state something 

276
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:07,784
clear.
And so what you do is you do your best 

277
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:09,704
to say what you mean and then you listen
to other people tell you why you're a 

278
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,760
blithering idiot.

279
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,593
And hopefully you can correct yourself 
to some degree as a consequence of 

280
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:18,104
listening to them.
And you see that's what free speech is 

281
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:23,090
about because you have to,
it,

282
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,013
it isn't just the people can,
can organize themselves and their 

283
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:29,690
societies by thinking you can't do that 
because there's only one of you.

284
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:30,524
What you have to do is you have to 
articulate your thoughts in a public 

285
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:33,374
forum so that other people can attack 
you and hopefully in a corrective 

286
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:37,520
manner.
And then you want to,

287
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,440
you know,
step back a little bit and think,

288
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:40,274
okay,
well you know I was a little arrogant 

289
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:43,910
there and I was a little over emotional 
there and I didn't get that quite right.

290
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:46,640
And maybe I'm outright biased on that 
front.

291
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:48,950
And you,
you want to correct what you say because

292
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:52,670
then you correct how you are and then 
you correct how you act in life and then

293
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:54,070
you correct your society.

294
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,410
And to the degree that we limit free 
freedom of expression,

295
00:16:57,411 --> 00:16:59,450
we put all of that at risk.
You know,

296
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,150
I'm a clinical psychologist and one of 
the things,

297
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,013
there's two things that we kind of know 
about why clinical psychology works and 

298
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:06,254
one is that people get stronger if they 
voluntarily expose themselves to things 

299
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:11,630
they're afraid of and that they're 
disgusted by.

300
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,733
It's like a,
it's a hallmark of clinical 

301
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:14,534
psychotherapy.
And I would say it's also the defining 

302
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:19,160
characteristic of,
of appropriate human adaptation,

303
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,530
right?
Is that you have to confront the chaotic

304
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:24,860
things that you don't understand and 
then learn to master them and articulate

305
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:25,694
them.
And the other is that clinical 

306
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:30,290
psychotherapy works because people can 
come say into my office and they can say

307
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,124
whatever they have to say,
no matter how incoherent it is or how 

308
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,203
psychotic it is or,
or how overbearing it is or confused or 

309
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:38,630
jumbled.

310
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,463
And sometimes it takes my clients months
or years of continual conversation just 

311
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:44,654
to start to untie the hundreds of 
thousands of knots that have been badly 

312
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:50,130
tied in their minds.
So,

313
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,583
and that's partly why I don't believe 
that freedom of speech is just another 

314
00:17:53,581 --> 00:17:55,260
value.
I think that's preposterous.

315
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:56,094
I think that if you claim that,
then you know nothing about Western 

316
00:17:57,991 --> 00:18:02,280
civilization and history is freedom of 
speech is not just another principle.

317
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,420
It's the mechanism by which we keep our 
psyches and our society's organized.

318
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:07,254
And we have to be unbelievably careful 
about in infringing upon that because 

319
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:16,170
we're infringing upon the process by 
which we keep chaos and order balanced,

320
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:17,670
you know?
And,

321
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,740
and if chaos and order go out of 
balance,

322
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:20,574
then then then,
then all hell breaks loose and the 

323
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,680
situation is not good.
And we've seen that happen many,

324
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:27,690
many times in the 20th century.
Right.

325
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:30,450
Since the late 18 hundreds our 
societies,

326
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:35,451
western societies have been careening 
madly between the hyper repressive order

327
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:40,110
of the radical right and the absolute 
devouring chaos of the radical left.

328
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,123
We've become unmoored.
We've lost our bearings and the only 

329
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:44,994
thing that can possibly save us from 
continuing to do exactly that is the 

330
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:51,780
dialogue of exactly the sort that I'm,
I'm,

331
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,733
I'm describing at the moment and what 
we're attempting to do today in this 

332
00:18:55,261 --> 00:18:56,094
forum.
Thank God the university agreed to have 

333
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,040
this debate,
you know,

334
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,920
because there's things to talk about and
if we don't talk about them,

335
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:03,750
then we're going to fight.
Well,

336
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,703
what is this all about?
I can list you some of the things that 

337
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:08,274
it's about,
it's about inclusion versus bigotry and 

338
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:12,300
prejudice,
right?

339
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:14,430
It's about the left wing versus the 
right wing.

340
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,090
It's about who's free to choose their 
language and what,

341
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,850
what,
what elements of respect that you're due

342
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:21,684
to people who are different than you say
with regards to Pronoun Use are chosen 

343
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:28,050
names.
It's about whether the subject of or the

344
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:28,884
object of is going to take precedence 
because implicit in bill [inaudible] 16 

345
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:35,520
and I'm telling you there's an assault 
on the idea of objectivity itself,

346
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:36,354
an assault on the idea of biology itself
and if the university thinks that the 

347
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:40,404
sciences are going to be immune from the
ideological doctrine that's embedded in 

348
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:45,840
these,
in these pieces of legislation,

349
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:49,080
they better think again because there 
there is trouble coming.

350
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,913
I know that [inaudible] already has an 
anti psychiatry program and we noticed 

351
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:53,724
the Ken Zucker got hounded out of this 
job just a few years ago even though he 

352
00:19:56,191 --> 00:19:58,560
was an entirely credible scientist and 
clinician.

353
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:04,490
So it's about constructionism,
social constructionism versus positivism

354
00:20:04,831 --> 00:20:05,664
versus pragmatism and there's,
there's a mother versus father thing 

355
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:09,234
going on here too and you know,
you kind of saw that with Hillary 

356
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,053
Clinton versus Donald Trump.
I would say that was the overprotective 

357
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,100
devouring mother versus the tyrannical 
father,

358
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:17,963
which is not a good,
that's not a good narrative from a 

359
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:24,960
mythological perspective.
It's about also the adversarial spirit I

360
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:25,794
would say versus the logos.
That's at the deepest possible level of 

361
00:20:28,351 --> 00:20:31,890
analysis than the adversarial spirit is 
the spirit declaimed.

362
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,873
What I think right now is correct above 
all else and I have nothing whatsoever 

363
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:40,920
to learn versus the logos and the logos 
is a very complex,

364
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,680
uh,
idea and maybe the deepest idea of,

365
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,790
of humanity.

366
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,500
I would say certainly the deepest idea 
of western civilization.

367
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,573
And that's that the proper citizen is 
the person who embodies truth in speech 

368
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,060
and attempts to act it out.
And that also includes listening because

369
00:20:58,061 --> 00:20:59,950
listening is part of communicative 
intent.

370
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:04,960
And I think at the moment that we're in,
we're embroiled in a war on every single

371
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:08,710
one of those dimensions and several 
others that I haven't had time to list.

372
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:09,544
And the,
the evidence that we're in that sort of 

373
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:14,860
war is precisely the fact that this is 
attracted so much attention.

374
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:15,694
I mean,
I just sat at my bloody office at home 

375
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:19,440
and threw up a couple of amateurish 
videos,

376
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,313
more or less attempting to articulate my
feelings about a couple of policies and 

377
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,200
it's like all hell broke loose and why?
Well,

378
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,500
because that hail is right underneath 
the surface.

379
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,370
I think to stop there,
but you're right.

380
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,443
I'm done.

381
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:40,050
[inaudible]
thank you.

382
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,070
Thank you,
Professor Moran.

383
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,750
Provost Moran.
Um,

384
00:21:53,751 --> 00:21:54,584
I'd like to start by saying that I'm 
delighted to be here today except that 

385
00:21:57,891 --> 00:22:01,610
I'm not,
and I'd like to start by saying how much

386
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,444
I support and respect all those faculty,
staff and students who are boycotting 

387
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:05,924
today's event.
I think that that is also a very 

388
00:22:07,371 --> 00:22:08,690
important form of speech.

389
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,130
The a couple of days ago,

390
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,063
um,
the Oxford English dictionary announced 

391
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,240
the word of the year and it's post 
truth.

392
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,693
It's relating to or denoting 
circumstances in which objective facts 

393
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,473
are less influential in shaping public 
opinion than appeals to emotion and 

394
00:22:26,781 --> 00:22:31,610
personal belief.
So I worry about the ways that post post

395
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,473
truth claims have been affecting public 
discussions around bill see 16 around 

396
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:40,340
the Ontario human rights code and around
freedom of expression.

397
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,010
There have been some profound,

398
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,873
okay,

399
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,630
it's not part of my time,
that little correction.

400
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,110
There've been some profound 
misunderstandings.

401
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,890
I'm circulating about the law and I'm 
here today as a lawyer,

402
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,620
as a law professor,
as a civil libertarian,

403
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,693
as an expert in equality rights and 
freedom of expression to try to correct 

404
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,473
those misunderstandings.
So let's start with bill [inaudible] 16 

405
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,520
which passed third reading yesterday in 
the house.

406
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,880
It's the proposed federal legislation 
that does three things.

407
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,833
First,
it adds gender identity and expression 

408
00:23:14,671 --> 00:23:18,930
to the Canadian human rights code.
It will prevent the Canadian government,

409
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:22,590
federal agencies and businesses within 
federal jurisdiction,

410
00:23:22,591 --> 00:23:24,900
which are quite limited banks,
telecoms,

411
00:23:24,901 --> 00:23:29,901
airlines from discriminating on the 
basis of gender identity and expression.

412
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,240
This is hardly unprecedented.
Indeed.

413
00:23:33,241 --> 00:23:35,010
The federal government is late to this 
game.

414
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:40,100
I'm starting in 2002 and moving forward.
The Northwest Territory's Manitoba,

415
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:41,730
Ontario,
Nova Scotia,

416
00:23:41,731 --> 00:23:43,320
Prince Edward Island,
Newfoundlands,

417
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:44,820
Saskatchewan,
Alberta,

418
00:23:44,821 --> 00:23:45,654
Quebec,
British Columbia have already passed 

419
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:47,600
these protections.

420
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:48,883
Ontario has had these since 2002 the 
federal government here is simply 

421
00:23:52,191 --> 00:23:56,120
playing catchup.
There's absolutely nothing unprecedented

422
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:58,130
in this.
Number two,

423
00:23:58,131 --> 00:23:58,964
Bill See,
16 adds gender identity and gender 

424
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:01,634
expression to provisions in the criminal
code that define an identifiable group 

425
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,113
for the purposes of advocating genocide.
The public incitement of hatred and the 

426
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:17,501
willful promotion of hatred.
So how might these provisions affect the

427
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:23,021
use of pronouns and do these provisions 
in any way criminalize the use or misuse

428
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:26,570
of pronouns,
not even close.

429
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,393
First,
it is absolutely not advocating 

430
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:30,794
genocide.
Now the last one wants to start talking 

431
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:37,790
about we should kill all the axes then 
that's advocating genocide,

432
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,170
but pronoun use nowhere.
Close public incitement of hatred.

433
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,693
Well,
the provisions of the Criminal Code 

434
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:48,740
requires that the incitement is likely 
to lead to a breach of the peace.

435
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,420
Now,
does that sound subjective?

436
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,583
Well,
the Supreme Court of Canada has said 

437
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,310
there's a very clear,
there's a very clear definition.

438
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,920
The threshold is violence.
In fact,

439
00:24:57,921 --> 00:25:02,750
there has to be personal violence.
It is an extremely high threshold,

440
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:03,883
and again,
the misuse of pronouns doesn't come 

441
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,320
anywhere close.
Finally,

442
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,183
the willful promotion of hatred,
so called hate speech provisions now 

443
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:16,760
hates be provisions in the criminal code
have a very,

444
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:17,594
very high threshold.
The Supreme Court of Canada has 

445
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:21,134
repeatedly defined hate speech as only 
including the most extreme forms of 

446
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:28,490
speech the court has said over and over 
again.

447
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:29,324
And I quote it is quote the unusually 
strong and deep felt emotions of 

448
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:38,480
vilification and detestation the court 
has said it is not disdain,

449
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,343
it is not dislike,
it is not offense plus something that's 

450
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:44,690
often lost.
Hate speech.

451
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:49,310
Criminal charges cannot be laid without 
the approval of the attorney general.

452
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,353
So this is a high threshold.
They are very difficult charges to 

453
00:25:53,211 --> 00:25:55,340
bring.
Third Bill,

454
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:56,174
see 16 adds gender identity and 
expression to the provisions of the 

455
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:02,150
criminal code that deal with sentencing 
for hate crimes.

456
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,643
Now here under this particular section 
seven 18 to a one w we tend to be 

457
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:10,250
concerned about numbers,
um,

458
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,710
evidence that an offense is motivated by
bias,

459
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:15,260
prejudice or hatred can be taken into 
account.

460
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,123
In sentencing,
we already take a range of things into 

461
00:26:18,471 --> 00:26:19,520
account,
race,

462
00:26:19,521 --> 00:26:21,860
national and ethnic origin,
religion,

463
00:26:21,861 --> 00:26:23,330
sex,
age and others.

464
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:24,403
So now evidence of hatred on the basis 
of gender identity and expression could 

465
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:29,654
be taken into account.
It's important to emphasize section 

466
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:36,140
seven 18 does not create any new 
offenses.

467
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,213
It simply means that any existing 
offense in the criminal code like 

468
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:45,041
assault or sexual assault or murder,
if it's motivated by hatred,

469
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:50,270
could be given an increased sense.
This has no impact on pronouns unless of

470
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:52,404
course,
and accused was misusing pronouns while 

471
00:26:55,231 --> 00:26:58,500
assaulting sexually assaulting or 
murdering someone.

472
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,933
In other words,
there's nothing in Bilski 16 that comes 

473
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:04,950
close to criminalizing the misuse of 
pronouns.

474
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,870
Nothing,
not hate speech,

475
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,973
not hate crime.
Now let's look at the Ontario Human 

476
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,053
Rights Code.
So the Ontario Human Rights Code is a 

477
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:17,790
provincial law that protects individuals
from discrimination in housing,

478
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,990
Employment Services,
vocational associations and contracts.

479
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:25,740
It's not constitutional law,
which limits government action.

480
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:29,880
It's not criminal law where the state 
prosecutes individuals and sends them to

481
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:30,714
jail.
It's a type of civil law where private 

482
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:35,100
individuals can sue one another.
Um,

483
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,830
and the,
the remedy is generally damages.

484
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,640
The Ontario Human Rights Code was first 
passed in 1962.

485
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:45,270
It protects people from all kinds of 
discrimination.

486
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,133
It protects people from being fired on 
the basis of their race or it protects 

487
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:50,634
people from being denied housing on the 
basis of their religion or it protects 

488
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:58,800
people from being called the n word or 
any other racial epithet in the delivery

489
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:03,801
of services like a university classroom.
Since 2012 the Ontario Human Rights Code

490
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:05,754
has prohibited discrimination and 
harassment on the basis of gender 

491
00:28:08,731 --> 00:28:09,870
identity and expression.

492
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,243
It prevents discrimination and 
harassment against Trans and gender non 

493
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:16,830
binary individuals in employment,
housing and services.

494
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,890
So what does this require in relation to
pronouns?

495
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:25,410
According to the Ontario Human Rights 
Commission's policy section 7.4,

496
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,423
it specifically said that refusing to 
refer to a person by their self 

497
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:34,311
identified name or proper Pronoun could 
constitute gender based harassment.

498
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,573
And as a result of some q and a's that 
were released yesterday by the 

499
00:28:39,181 --> 00:28:39,990
commission,
uh,

500
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,900
clarifying this question of Gender 
Pronoun use,

501
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,123
um,
uh,

502
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:44,963
they stated the following,
refusing to refer to a trans person by 

503
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:49,074
their chosen name and a personal pronoun
that matches their gender identity or 

504
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:53,784
purposely misgendering will likely be 
discrimination when it takes place in a 

505
00:28:57,371 --> 00:28:59,250
social arena.
Covered by the code,

506
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:03,480
including employment,
housing services like education,

507
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,780
but about gender neutral pronouns.
Well,

508
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,643
the commission has said the Ontario 
Human Rights Code does not require any 

509
00:29:10,621 --> 00:29:14,190
particular gender neutral pronoun.
If in doubt,

510
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,350
ask the person how they wish to be 
addressed.

511
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:20,070
Use they if you don't know or simply use
their chosen name.

512
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,640
So what it seems to require is the use 
of he,

513
00:29:23,641 --> 00:29:26,580
she or they.
And if you don't like that,

514
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:27,743
then you can always just use their name.
There is no question of the 31 flavors 

515
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:34,710
that has been put out there that is 
somehow being mandated.

516
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,240
Um,
this is about he,

517
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,074
she,
they,

518
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,750
or if you don't like it,
use a person's name.

519
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,363
Some questions have arisen about this.
Is this the first time that a law has 

520
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:48,430
decided what we must say as opposed to 
what we cannot say?

521
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,040
No,
not at all.

522
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,340
Not even close.
It's not uncommon for the law to require

523
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:55,174
expression.
Bilingual labeling requirements on food 

524
00:29:57,731 --> 00:30:00,520
packaging,
health warnings on cigarette packages,

525
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:04,540
the oath of allegiance to the queen that
must be sworn at citizenship.

526
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:07,780
Ship ceremonies.
Not only is forced expression,

527
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:08,614
not new,
there's an entire chapter dedicated to 

528
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:13,750
it in Peter Hogg's constitutional law of
Canada.

529
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:14,973
Now,
for those of you who don't know Peter 

530
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,710
Hog is in law,
we usually deal with,

531
00:30:17,711 --> 00:30:21,400
we refer to him in a hushed voice.
He is the leading authoritative,

532
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:22,234
it is the leading authoritative texts in
Canadian constitutional law by Canada's 

533
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,810
preeminent constitutional scholar and 
lawyer.

534
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,840
Okay,
so is it constitutional?

535
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:32,703
Now,
are these requirements around pronouns 

536
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:37,060
constitutional?
Does the requirement to not miss gender?

537
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:37,894
The pronouns violate freedom of 
expression under section two B of the 

538
00:30:40,451 --> 00:30:43,180
Canadian Charter of rights and freedoms?
Probably a does.

539
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,643
The Supreme Court of Canada says any 
restriction on speech is a prime fascia 

540
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,993
violation of section two b.
But the thing is that's not the end of 

541
00:30:51,911 --> 00:30:55,870
the story.
The charter rights are not absolute.

542
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,733
No charter rights are absolute.
There's this whole other section in the 

543
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:04,150
charter called section one which says 
that all rights and freedoms are subject

544
00:31:04,151 --> 00:31:04,984
to reasonable limits as are demonstrably
justifiable in a free and democratic 

545
00:31:08,471 --> 00:31:09,304
society.

546
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,443
The Supreme Court of Canada has 
developed a very complex test through 

547
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:16,810
which it balances rights.
On the one hand and reasonable limits on

548
00:31:16,811 --> 00:31:19,960
the other.
This is what the Supreme Court of Canada

549
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:20,794
does in charter cases.
And the Supreme Court of Canada has on 

550
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:24,874
numerous occasions considered whether 
restrictions on speech contained in 

551
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:33,211
human rights codes are constitutional.
It has consistently,

552
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,043
and I have to emphasize consistently 
held that although any speech 

553
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:39,604
restrictions that are contained in a 
human rights code may violate section 

554
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:43,204
two B of the charter.
They are a reasonable limit within the 

555
00:31:45,641 --> 00:31:46,474
meaning of section one.
They held this in the case of Ross in 

556
00:31:49,481 --> 00:31:54,481
the case of Taylor and most recently,
unanimously by the court in 2013.

557
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,950
Um,
I have a little thing then about why all

558
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:04,951
this matters and I'm out of time.
But why it all matters is um,

559
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,123
because people matter and I worry that 
we've moved into a place now a kind of 

560
00:32:10,151 --> 00:32:10,984
not only a post truth politics,
but a kind of post empathy politics 

561
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:17,200
where we no longer seem to care about 
people.

562
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,750
And this at the end of the day is about 
people.

563
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:23,050
It's about trans and gender non binary 
people.

564
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,480
These are our children,
our siblings,

565
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:26,890
our nieces,
our nephews.

566
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,780
These are our friends,
our neighbors,

567
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:29,614
our colleagues,
our lawyers are carpenters and our 

568
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:32,494
teachers.
How bloody hard is it to simply treat 

569
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:40,010
these people with respect and dignity?
Because all this is about

570
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,430
all human rights are about,
is respect and dignity.

571
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,280
And if he could throw in a little 
kindness on the top,

572
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,200
that would be even better.

573
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,360
[inaudible]

574
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,940
thank you very much.
Uh,

575
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,210
professor Cossman and now we will go 
back.

576
00:33:06,211 --> 00:33:07,044
So what number?
I said we're after we do the first 

577
00:33:08,911 --> 00:33:09,744
section.
We're going to go back to Professor 

578
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:14,250
Peterson.
And on this section we're going to focus

579
00:33:14,251 --> 00:33:15,084
a little bit more on academic freedom,
gender diversity in some of the 

580
00:33:18,211 --> 00:33:20,520
implications for scholarship and 
teaching.

581
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,380
Um,
so professor Peterson,

582
00:33:22,381 --> 00:33:25,560
I didn't bite you to go first again,
10 minutes.

583
00:33:25,561 --> 00:33:26,850
We'll have our,
our time,

584
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,820
our excellent timekeeper back there.
Thank you.

585
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,223
So I'm gonna read you something that a 
graduate student sent me from the 

586
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,413
University of Toronto the other day.
And I can also tell you that I've 

587
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:45,340
received hundreds of letters like this 
today.

588
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,593
I had a tutorial at the University of 
Toronto where I talked about Jordan 

589
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,910
Peterson and issues of personal 
identity,

590
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,730
legally sanctioned identity categories,
et cetera.

591
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:55,863
I brought up a video of a tall white man
in his thirties who asked students out 

592
00:33:59,981 --> 00:34:02,110
of university how they'd react if he 
told them.

593
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,020
He identified as a woman,
as black,

594
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:10,030
as short and as five years old.
Spoiler alert.

595
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,020
Students in the video resists some of 
the later categories a bit better,

596
00:34:14,021 --> 00:34:19,021
mostly accepting still students were not
engaging in discussion.

597
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:25,140
I asked them why one said it was because
she was worried to share her opinion for

598
00:34:26,171 --> 00:34:29,050
fear of being singled out or saying 
something offensive.

599
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,560
I asked who else was not speaking for 
that reason.

600
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:40,020
The whole class put their hands up.
That was shocking to me.

601
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,583
I encouraged them to speak despite their
worries and they gave me some good 

602
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:49,490
feedback on how to make it easier for 
them to do so.

603
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,403
For instance,
by working in pairs and being assigned 

604
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:56,894
an opinion so that they didn't have to 
be responsible for it or feel bad for 

605
00:35:01,911 --> 00:35:05,270
defending it.
No participation.

606
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,183
Why

607
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:13,650
they weren't on interested.
They were afraid to speak their minds.

608
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,160
The PC police are in your heads.

609
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,950
He just turned the lawyer's opinion.
I have many lawyers opinions.

610
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:28,784
By the way.
I'll start with lawyer one who was the 

611
00:35:31,221 --> 00:35:32,054
counsel to several prime ministers.
He talked to me about the human rights 

612
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:36,950
tribunal cause I went and saw him two 
weeks after this all started.

613
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,250
Human Rights Tribunal is a kangaroo 
court in my opinion,

614
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,470
and it should be abolished as fast as 
possible.

615
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,980
It's one of the many institutions in 
Canada that pose a threat to your,

616
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,700
to your freedom that that is almost 
unimaginable proportions.

617
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:51,534
Here's what this top lawyer told me.
If I'm taking in front of the human 

618
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:57,324
rights tribunal and will cost me 
$250,000 I will pay the legal costs for 

619
00:36:01,061 --> 00:36:04,860
my opponents and I will lose.
He said,

620
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:08,130
go back to your safe little life and 
shut your mouth.

621
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:10,943
Second lawyer told me my critique of the
Ontario Human Rights Commission is spot 

622
00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:18,090
on and absent the charter of rights and 
freedoms,

623
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,480
which has these contradictions built 
into it that you just heard described.

624
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,613
Much of what I was saying was illegal 
and has been illegal since 2012 lawyer 

625
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:30,750
three told me that if I breached a 
tribunal order,

626
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:33,990
so imagine I was taken in front of the 
human rights tribunal and I was fine and

627
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:34,824
then I refused to pay the fine,
which I've stated that I would do that 

628
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:39,624
equals contempt of court,
which inevitably means jail until the 

629
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:45,960
contempt is purged.
He told me the social justice tribunals,

630
00:36:45,961 --> 00:36:46,794
and that's the technical name of these 
essentially extra judicial bodies in 

631
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:50,580
Ontario,
by the way,

632
00:36:50,581 --> 00:36:51,414
the social justice tribunals.
So the PC authoritarian types aren't 

633
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:56,550
even trying to hide their terminology 
anymore.

634
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,793
The social justice tribunals and the 
sjws social justice warriors who staff 

635
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:02,844
them have a robe nature.
They can search your house without a 

636
00:37:05,011 --> 00:37:07,470
warrant.
They can use secret hearings.

637
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,560
There are no rules of evidence and the 
judges are unaccountable.

638
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,030
Your worst fears of the effect of a 
poorly written law will manifest in that

639
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:19,110
environment.
The sjw say only the worst of the worst.

640
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:22,500
We'll get punished.
Think again with them at the helm.

641
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:26,400
Anything can and does happen,
but those are legal opinions.

642
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:27,930
Let's,
let's look at a real world case.

643
00:37:27,931 --> 00:37:29,940
Let's look at what happened when I made 
my videos.

644
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:30,774
Let's look at how the university 
responded because I can tell you in the 

645
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:34,320
video,
I said,

646
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,153
look,
what I'm doing is probably illegal and 

647
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:37,044
worse,
my employer is legally responsible for 

648
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:41,250
it because that's built in.
That's built into the codes as well.

649
00:37:41,251 --> 00:37:42,510
So by the way,
if you're an employer,

650
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:43,344
you're responsible for everything that 
your employees say and everything that 

651
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,040
anybody interprets what they said as 
being,

652
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:52,470
whether it's unintentional or 
intentional,

653
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:54,450
whether or not a complaint has been 
made.

654
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,130
So just think about that.

655
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,890
Anyways,
October 3rd the university said like all

656
00:37:58,891 --> 00:37:59,724
members of the university community,
I have an obligation to comply with the 

657
00:38:01,861 --> 00:38:02,694
law,
including the provisions of the Ontario 

658
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:05,783
Human Rights Code,
their policy with regards to workplace 

659
00:38:07,261 --> 00:38:08,094
harassment,
which the university implied that I was 

660
00:38:09,301 --> 00:38:10,134
engaging in engaging in a course of 
vexatious comment or conduct where the 

661
00:38:13,351 --> 00:38:14,184
course of comment or conduct is known or
ought reasonably be known to be 

662
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:20,340
unwelcome.
That was the October 3rd letter,

663
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:22,950
which was sent to me within one week of 
posting my videos.

664
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,600
And it was the first.
So what happened?

665
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:25,434
Essentially it was the university 
reviewed what I had done and then they 

666
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:31,680
reviewed the policies as laid out on the
Ontario Human Rights Commission website.

667
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:33,780
Where are you guys can all go read them 
by the way.

668
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:35,470
And then you can decide if,
if,

669
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,470
if the legal information that you were 
just provided with it,

670
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:40,900
with his in any degree whatsoever 
accurate.

671
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,220
Because I would say it isn't,
um,

672
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:48,630
the university reviewed my videos and 
they decided that what I said was true.

673
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,493
They decided that the video I made was 
probably illegal and if they were 

674
00:38:51,811 --> 00:38:52,644
responsible for it.
And so in an attempt to distance 

675
00:38:54,691 --> 00:38:55,524
themselves from me under counsel from 
their legal people and believe me the 

676
00:38:58,621 --> 00:38:59,454
university has good legal people,
they sent me a warning and this is what 

677
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:06,030
happens if you want a discipline and 
recalcitrant employee essentially what,

678
00:39:06,031 --> 00:39:09,000
so that you don't have to bear legal 
responsibility for their acts.

679
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,103
You send them a warning to show that 
you're not in favor of what they're 

680
00:39:12,031 --> 00:39:13,560
doing.
Then if they continue,

681
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:14,394
you send them another warning and then 
if they continue you send them a third 

682
00:39:16,831 --> 00:39:18,630
warning.
And after the third warning you can take

683
00:39:18,631 --> 00:39:19,464
further steps.
Now I pointed out to the university at 

684
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:23,910
one point when when,
um,

685
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,750
we were discussing how this forum was 
going to proceed,

686
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:28,584
that perhaps it would be in their best 
interests to not support the people who 

687
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:35,970
are trying to stop me from talking,
but instead to support me legally and if

688
00:39:35,971 --> 00:39:36,804
necessary,
to take this all the way to the supreme 

689
00:39:37,801 --> 00:39:38,634
court.
And the university said categorically 

690
00:39:39,631 --> 00:39:40,464
that they would not do that.
So I would say when it comes to the 

691
00:39:42,391 --> 00:39:45,960
contradictory provisions that are in the
Canadian Charter of rights and freedoms,

692
00:39:45,961 --> 00:39:48,840
and so we might say roughly equality 
versus freedom of speech,

693
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,540
the university decided which side 
they're going to go down on.

694
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,490
And you know,
people tell you all the time,

695
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,340
okay,

696
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,330
that this has to do with compassion.
You know,

697
00:39:57,331 --> 00:39:58,164
and it's obviously the case that all of 
the compassion in this disgust is 

698
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:03,510
discussion is on the side of the people 
who are,

699
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,590
who are,
um,

700
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:08,490
any encouraging their listeners to play 
victim and perpetrator.

701
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,463
And I can tell you as a 
psychoanalytically oriented 

702
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,263
psychologists that there's nothing more 
horrible for children and developing 

703
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:18,150
people than an excessive compassion,
right?

704
00:40:18,151 --> 00:40:20,760
That's the standard Friday and devouring
mother.

705
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,040
And if you want a little archetype,
uh,

706
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:25,320
to go along with that,
I suppose most of you have seen,

707
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,630
um,
the little mermaid.

708
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:32,490
You Remember Ursula?
Ursula wants to put King Poseidon's soul

709
00:40:32,491 --> 00:40:33,324
in a little jar in her collection and 
she wants to take away Ariel's voice so 

710
00:40:36,031 --> 00:40:39,120
she can't establish herself as a 
conscious being in the world.

711
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,313
And I would suggest very strongly that 
all these people that continually talk 

712
00:40:43,171 --> 00:40:48,171
to you about compassion do not in the 
least have your best interests in mind.

713
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,583
And there are far more virtues and 
values than an excessive pity for 

714
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:53,850
people.
You know,

715
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,560
you don't want a pitty your children 
even.

716
00:40:55,561 --> 00:40:56,394
You want to encourage them to develop 
and strong and in a strong and 

717
00:40:59,161 --> 00:41:01,950
forthright manner so that they can go 
out and take on the world.

718
00:41:01,951 --> 00:41:02,784
And an excess of compassion just to 
ensures that when they're 40 they're 

719
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:06,774
going to be living in your basement 
plotting evil routines about the world 

720
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:13,650
because their ability to manifest 
themselves as successful beings has been

721
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,813
absolutely compromised.
And I think that we're seeing this 

722
00:41:16,951 --> 00:41:18,180
played out.
We're busy,

723
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,580
we're seeing this played out in society 
and,

724
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,583
and I think it's absolutely horrifying.
So on October 18th the university 

725
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,303
mentioned to me in another warning 
letter that if personal pronouns are 

726
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:30,834
being used,
the refusal to use the personal pronoun 

727
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,003
that is an expression of the person's 
gender identity can constitute 

728
00:41:36,231 --> 00:41:37,070
discrimination.

729
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,233
So now you see what's happened is that I
haven't refused to use someone's 

730
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:45,590
gendered gender neutral pronouns I said 
that I would refuse.

731
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:49,100
So it's not even the refusal itself 
that's producing the letters.

732
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:52,580
It's my declared intent to engage in the
refusal.

733
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,593
And as far as I was concerned,
what I was essentially doing was 

734
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:58,130
criticizing a piece of legislation that 
had not yet been passed,

735
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:02,480
but the university's legal department 
decided that all that was sufficient for

736
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:06,890
them to distance themselves from me and 
to engage in disciplinary activity.

737
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:07,993
So,
and then with regards to these human 

738
00:42:09,531 --> 00:42:11,960
rights tribunals where all of this stuff
would be sorted out,

739
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:12,794
it's like those places destroy your 
reputation and destroy you financially 

740
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:17,780
and can they put you in jail?
Well,

741
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,850
it's a complicated argument in some 
sense,

742
00:42:19,851 --> 00:42:22,130
but I can tell you that if you refuse to
pay the fine.

743
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:22,963
So that's the next step.
So I think you're being sold a bill of 

744
00:42:25,701 --> 00:42:29,460
goods here about how benevolent the 
intent of bill see 16 is.

745
00:42:29,461 --> 00:42:33,170
And I also know because another lawyer 
told me that the,

746
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,930
because I suspected that the Ontario 
Human Rights Commission,

747
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:36,764
people were behind all of this 
legislation essentially speaking in 

748
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:39,674
Canada and that that's actually the case
because the federal people have 

749
00:42:42,891 --> 00:42:45,350
indicated that these policies will be 
interpreted,

750
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,423
interpreted in accordance with the 
Ontario Human Rights Commission's 

751
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,243
policies online.
And so you guys should go read those 

752
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:52,124
because those are not fun.
And I would say that they pose an 

753
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:54,914
incredible threat to your liberty and 
it's all done under the guise of 

754
00:42:57,351 --> 00:42:58,184
compassion.
So like I don't consider myself a 

755
00:42:59,931 --> 00:43:03,440
particularly compassionate person,
let's say.

756
00:43:03,441 --> 00:43:06,590
I think I'm more compassionate that I 
should be for my own wellbeing.

757
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:08,900
But I can tell you that that is not the 
only virtue.

758
00:43:08,901 --> 00:43:09,734
And people who keep pushing that on you 
are making a massive mistake and their 

759
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:13,843
infant tantalizing you and they're 
terrifying people in the university 

760
00:43:16,701 --> 00:43:19,700
community as you can tell by the letter 
that I just read it and I've really,

761
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:20,534
I received dozens of letters like that.
People are afraid to say anything 

762
00:43:22,881 --> 00:43:25,460
because they're going to get targeted.
And if you wonder or not,

763
00:43:25,461 --> 00:43:26,294
if that's true,
then just think about what happened to 

764
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:29,840
me and ask yourself if it's true.

765
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,360
Good enough.
Thank you.

766
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:38,410
[inaudible].

767
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,620
So professor Bryson,
can we have you speak next and uh,

768
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:52,220
may I just say thank you for coming out 
from Vancouver,

769
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,210
uh,
to join us.

770
00:43:53,211 --> 00:43:56,540
Every,
everyone else here is from University of

771
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,373
Toronto,
but professor Bryson came out from 

772
00:43:58,251 --> 00:43:59,390
Vancouver,
so thank you.

773
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,280
Thank you,
provost Moran.

774
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:07,680
What a wild ride we're on this morning.
We're all doing okay so far.

775
00:44:07,681 --> 00:44:12,600
I think as a Trinity College and Oil z 
alumnus,

776
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:16,560
I'm typically delighted to return to the
University of Toronto.

777
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:21,840
Today is different to make sense of what
it means to be here today.

778
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:22,943
I've found myself going back frequently 
to the 1989 debate at western on the 

779
00:44:28,091 --> 00:44:31,110
subject of race and Iq between Phillip 
Rushton,

780
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,123
David Suzuki,
the stakes then and now we're very 

781
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:40,020
familiar to borrow David Suzuki to 
opening words on that day.

782
00:44:40,021 --> 00:44:42,780
Quote,
I do not want to be here.

783
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:43,973
I do not want to dignify this man and 
his ideas in public debate and quote 

784
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,603
yesterday Bill See 16 passed third 
reading in the House of Commons and 

785
00:44:55,231 --> 00:45:00,231
tomorrow is a trans day of remembrance.
If you only hear this,

786
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:01,943
know that I am unwavering in my belief 
that the fundamental rights to safety 

787
00:45:06,901 --> 00:45:11,850
and the humanity of trans and non binary
people are not up for debate.

788
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,243
There was,
there was in 1989 at Western as now an 

789
00:45:22,561 --> 00:45:23,394
extraordinary media frenzy concerning 
the apparent threat to academic freedom 

790
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,003
posed by the mere possibility that 
academic freedom is not an absolute 

791
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:38,160
guarantee that has scholars our 
relationship with knowledge and with the

792
00:45:38,161 --> 00:45:38,994
public trust is tempered by 
responsibilities and limitations of 

793
00:45:43,981 --> 00:45:44,814
crucial.
Important to my argument today is that 

794
00:45:47,101 --> 00:45:51,300
this is a relationship structured not on
juridical grounds.

795
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:55,320
This is not about the law but on ethical
grounds.

796
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:56,543
The very real effects of the knowledge 
claims that we make as scholars require 

797
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:04,140
that our claims be subjected to rigorous
critical scrutiny.

798
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:05,363
And there is no set of knowledge claims.
More important to subject to critical 

799
00:46:09,721 --> 00:46:10,554
scrutiny than statements that appear to 
perpetuate and to insight already 

800
00:46:15,661 --> 00:46:18,690
existing forms of hatred,
violence,

801
00:46:18,691 --> 00:46:21,390
and prejudice toward members of minority
groups.

802
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:22,763
We need to identify and address the 
claims made in the recent public works 

803
00:46:27,181 --> 00:46:28,014
of Jordan Peterson claims about trans 
people claims about the validity of 

804
00:46:32,431 --> 00:46:33,264
gender identity claims about the proper 
use of pronouns and claims about 

805
00:46:37,801 --> 00:46:39,360
academic freedom rights.

806
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,463
And let's be clear,
we have a unique difficulty here today 

807
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,130
in subjecting these claims to scholarly 
scrutiny.

808
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,270
What kind of claims can you have?
An amateurish videos,

809
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:54,900
although this man is making these 
claims,

810
00:46:54,901 --> 00:46:55,734
has Dr. Jordan Peterson as a professor 
and a clinical psychologist employed at 

811
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:01,404
a great Canadian University.
The claims are not being made in 

812
00:47:05,641 --> 00:47:10,260
relation to any publicly accessible body
of peer reviewed scholarship.

813
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:12,870
So why this,
why now?

814
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,393
The recent public works of Jordan 
Peterson provide a fabulous case study 

815
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,270
of the cultural production of true 
believers,

816
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:27,120
the cultural production of ignorance in 
an age of reactionary populism,

817
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:31,600
the cultural,
a historian of cancer,

818
00:47:31,601 --> 00:47:32,434
Robert proctor coined the term ag 
natology to describe systematic 

819
00:47:36,701 --> 00:47:41,380
attention to the production of ignorance
and let's not beat around the bush.

820
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:42,543
Bad Science is deadly,
whether in the area of cancer or gender 

821
00:47:45,971 --> 00:47:46,804
and population health.
The cultural production of ignorance 

822
00:47:50,261 --> 00:47:51,094
does not point to a vacuum,
but rather represents a deliberate 

823
00:47:54,971 --> 00:47:58,660
relationship to knowledge that is 
consequential in our lives.

824
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:03,040
For proctor,
the tactics used by the tobacco industry

825
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,113
provide a perfect example of how doubt 
and controversy are enlisted to produce 

826
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,513
ignorance.
So let's take a look at how 

827
00:48:12,191 --> 00:48:16,420
consequential and studied ignorance 
works in relation to gender.

828
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:22,050
Here are the major claims of Dr 
Peterson's recent public works.

829
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:23,283
Specifically the first of three lectures
concerning bill see 16 and I will quote 

830
00:48:28,871 --> 00:48:33,871
directly here from my lecture transcript
bill.

831
00:48:34,061 --> 00:48:38,140
See 16 scares me lectures,
Dr. Peterson,

832
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:43,590
the Ontario Human Rights Commission is a
particularly pathological organization.

833
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,213
Social Justice Warrior types are 
overrepresented and I can't help but 

834
00:48:49,451 --> 00:48:50,284
think it's because our current premier 
is a lesbian and the lgbt community has 

835
00:48:57,071 --> 00:48:57,904
become extraordinarily good at 
organizing themselves and has a fairly 

836
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:07,150
pronounced and very,
very sophisticated radical fringe.

837
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:11,440
I'll carry on,
and I quote,

838
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:15,250
gender identity and gender expression 
are not valid ideas.

839
00:49:15,251 --> 00:49:17,500
They're not true.
There's no evidence for it.

840
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:22,000
I don't know what the options are if you
don't identify as a man or a woman.

841
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:26,080
There's an idea that there's a gender 
spectrum.

842
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:26,943
I think it's an ill informed opinion and
quote rather than to address himself to 

843
00:49:32,111 --> 00:49:32,944
this scientific evidence concerning 
gender identity and expression and by 

844
00:49:36,911 --> 00:49:37,744
adopting rhetorical strategies more 
common to Breitbart news.com than a 

845
00:49:42,491 --> 00:49:43,324
university professors lecture.
Dr. Peterson goes on to discredit the 

846
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:48,274
very constructs on political grounds 
instead of on grounds provided by 

847
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:53,374
scholarly evidence that these constructs
are in no particular order leftist 

848
00:49:58,450 --> 00:49:59,283
radical and politically correct on the 
subject of pronouns and gender 

849
00:50:04,091 --> 00:50:07,060
expression.
Dr. Peterson is in phatic.

850
00:50:07,061 --> 00:50:10,450
That quote,
I don't recognize another person's right

851
00:50:10,451 --> 00:50:13,270
to determine what pronouns I use to 
address them.

852
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:17,170
I won't do it.
For the vast majority of people.

853
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:18,004
He goes on to say gender identity and 
sexual orientation and I guess he means 

854
00:50:22,031 --> 00:50:24,820
sex are the same thing.
And quote,

855
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:29,870
as for the definition of transgender,
Dr. Peterson claims that,

856
00:50:29,871 --> 00:50:33,290
and I quote,
I don't believe that they,

857
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,830
these people,
these terms stand for good things.

858
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:37,963
I think that these people use these 
terms as a pretense that they stand for 

859
00:50:43,161 --> 00:50:43,994
good things as a pretext for them to 
continue their nefarious activities and 

860
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:51,080
quote,
well,

861
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,220
this is hardly the stuff of academic 
scholarship.

862
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:56,563
I'm a member of the global education 
initiative of the World Professional 

863
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:01,963
Association for transgender health and I
can tell you without a shred of doubt 

864
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:10,510
that there is no link between the public
claims made by professor Jordan Peterson

865
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:16,040
about gender generally and transgender 
specifically,

866
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:20,450
and a body of easily accessible peer 
reviewed scholarship.

867
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:21,763
This body of peer reviewed research 
knowledge provides conclusive evidence 

868
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:26,863
that whereas anatomical sex is perhaps 
dimorphic Lee categorical and that's 

869
00:51:30,621 --> 00:51:31,454
only if we choose to ignore intersects,
that secondary sex characteristics 

870
00:51:35,601 --> 00:51:36,434
cannot be argued simplistically to be 
determined by Chromosomal sex and that 

871
00:51:40,491 --> 00:51:41,324
there is highly significant diversity in
gender identity and expression which 

872
00:51:45,681 --> 00:51:46,514
exists on a continuum that reveals 
persistent differences that cannot be 

873
00:51:50,331 --> 00:51:52,640
explained by sex assigned at birth.

874
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:54,163
Gender identity and expression are 
dynamic bio social aspects of human 

875
00:51:58,491 --> 00:51:59,324
diversity that are culturally and 
socially in a complex relationship with 

876
00:52:03,201 --> 00:52:04,034
matter.
Gender identity and expression are 

877
00:52:06,501 --> 00:52:07,334
linked both to the extraordinary 
plasticity of human life and the 

878
00:52:11,001 --> 00:52:11,834
fluidity of identity and as well.
And this is where we must pay close 

879
00:52:15,711 --> 00:52:16,544
attention linked to gender based 
violence to minority stress and threats 

880
00:52:22,551 --> 00:52:27,410
to a whole host of rights in Canada that
are not up for debate here today.

881
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:30,440
These rights include the right to 
recognition,

882
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,930
the right to communicability of 
presence,

883
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:36,680
the right to culturally competent 
institutional climates,

884
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,680
and perhaps the most profound of all 
rights,

885
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:44,210
the right to safety and the right to 
culture and access to knowledge.

886
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:45,463
Whereas almost all the media attention 
on the Jordan Peterson affair has 

887
00:52:49,371 --> 00:52:52,460
focused on the possible threat to his 
academic freedom.

888
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:53,773
I want to focus instead on the ethical 
significance of an academic's total 

889
00:52:59,271 --> 00:53:01,910
dereliction of academic responsibility.

890
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,073
Academics are never free to distribute 
totally bogus claims while trading on 

891
00:53:08,001 --> 00:53:08,834
the value provided by their title as a 
professor in a great Canadian 

892
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:13,753
University,
and perhaps even worse as a clinician 

893
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:20,330
registered by an accreditation body,
quite the contrary,

894
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:21,763
every faculty member takes on academic 
responsibilities that embody an ethical 

895
00:53:26,671 --> 00:53:27,504
commitment,
which is precisely not responsibilities 

896
00:53:30,091 --> 00:53:30,924
required by the law.
Academic knowledge that appears to 

897
00:53:34,351 --> 00:53:35,184
codify knowledge about minority 
populations must not add to the harms 

898
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:40,883
already facing minority groups by itself
contributing to the consolidation of 

899
00:53:45,301 --> 00:53:48,990
ignorance,
nor by inciting hatred toward members of

900
00:53:48,991 --> 00:53:52,830
these groups.
Faced with Phillip Russians perpetuation

901
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:58,190
of racist assumptions in his research on
race and Iq in the 1989 debate,

902
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:03,150
David Suzuki concludes that one can only
infer quote.

903
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,580
He is either grossly ignorant or 
deliberately mischievous.

904
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:12,990
Either way,
what is required is action by scientists

905
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:16,980
and academics.
His claims must be denounced.

906
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:17,963
This is not science and quote.
Surely the deliberate production of 

907
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:23,993
ignorance concerning a precarious 
minority group constitutes evidence of 

908
00:54:28,591 --> 00:54:29,424
the most unethical abnegation of the 
responsibility of academics to 

909
00:54:33,841 --> 00:54:38,400
contribute to human wellbeing,
collective intelligence flourishing,

910
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:43,430
and the survival of planetary life.
The institution of the Public University

911
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,753
cannot and must not sanction ignorance.
And most emphatically we must denounce 

912
00:54:50,071 --> 00:54:53,010
the deliberate cultural production of 
ignorance.

913
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,840
We can and we must do better and we must
do better.

914
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:58,853
Not because it is prescribed by the law,
but because we have an ethical 

915
00:55:02,671 --> 00:55:06,840
commitment to contribute to the 
advancement of knowledge in a democratic

916
00:55:06,841 --> 00:55:08,670
society.
Thank you.

917
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:14,320
[inaudible]

918
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,940
thank you all very much.
Um,

919
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:25,360
and so now I'm going to just ask a few 
questions of clarification.

920
00:55:25,361 --> 00:55:29,140
We'll go more or less in the order that 
the speakers went.

921
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,370
And then as I indicated,
there are questions from the audience.

922
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:37,090
You can email them.
The address is there.

923
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:39,460
Um,
I think there are people in the room.

924
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:40,990
There we go.
There are a few people.

925
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:46,140
So put up your hands if you don't have a
capacity to email and they'll get around

926
00:55:46,181 --> 00:55:48,100
to you.
We won't be able to ask,

927
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:50,320
answer all the questions some or post 
them,

928
00:55:50,321 --> 00:55:52,060
but we'll do our best.
Um,

929
00:55:52,061 --> 00:55:52,894
so professor Peterson,
I'll start with you since you were the 

930
00:55:54,641 --> 00:55:56,310
first speaker.
Um,

931
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:57,243
of course there,
there are a few lawyers on the stage 

932
00:55:58,661 --> 00:55:59,494
here.
Law seems to figure very prominently in 

933
00:56:02,261 --> 00:56:04,870
your argument and in many of your 
concerns.

934
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,033
And Professor Cossman is obviously set 
out a number of the issues in terms of 

935
00:56:10,211 --> 00:56:12,100
what the laws to actually say.

936
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,233
You cited in response a number of legal 
experts and one of the things about 

937
00:56:17,171 --> 00:56:20,260
legal experts as there are a lot of them
and they often don't agree.

938
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:21,820
Um,
but um,

939
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:26,800
in law we tend to between the law as it 
is and the laws we would like it to be.

940
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:31,780
And the experts you cited seem to be 
critical of the law as it is,

941
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,430
um,
along with you.

942
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:34,503
Um,
but does professors costs minutes 

943
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:41,050
outlining of some of the elements of see
16 in particular,

944
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:42,003
does that give you any comfort?
Does that allay any of your concerns 

945
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:45,544
that it really focuses on the advocacy 
of genocide or the commission of hate 

946
00:56:49,331 --> 00:56:50,164
crimes?
And that those kinds of things are 

947
00:56:51,971 --> 00:56:56,170
probably the sort of restrictions that 
most people in the room would think were

948
00:56:56,171 --> 00:56:58,330
reasonable restrictions.
Okay.

949
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,590
No,
are you just give me any comfort.

950
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:01,533
Um,
and the reason it doesn't give me any 

951
00:57:02,571 --> 00:57:04,880
comfort is because as far as I'm 
concerned,

952
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:09,050
what this is actually about has already 
played itself out in my case.

953
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:11,360
And I already explained,
explained that to you.

954
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:12,523
Um,
I want to tell you some of the 

955
00:57:13,851 --> 00:57:17,900
pernicious things about the,
about the legislation and this is,

956
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,150
and she means see 16,
is that what you are actually,

957
00:57:20,151 --> 00:57:23,890
I mean the policy guidelines that it 
will be interpreted with him because the

958
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,410
legislation itself is only a couple of 
paragraphs in it and it looks innocuous.

959
00:57:27,411 --> 00:57:30,080
But you know,
I would say a,

960
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:35,090
a legal doctrine is something like a 
virus and it has a life if you output,

961
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:35,953
we think if you,
if you let it go into a living system 

962
00:57:38,871 --> 00:57:42,500
that it propagates and it has effects 
and the effects are a consequence of the

963
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:44,360
philosophy that's embedded inside the 
law.

964
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,130
And if you really want to know about 
this,

965
00:57:46,131 --> 00:57:48,770
you should read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn 
school like archipelago.

966
00:57:48,771 --> 00:57:49,604
Because what he does in that book is 
tell you how the hypothetically humane 

967
00:57:52,491 --> 00:57:53,324
doctrines that were embedded in radical 
Marxism at the end of the 18 hundreds 

968
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,013
unfolded into Soviet society and 
demolished it along with many other 

969
00:57:59,661 --> 00:58:00,560
societies.
I might,

970
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:01,423
I might point out 10.
He won the Nobel prize for that for no 

971
00:58:03,441 --> 00:58:04,274
small reason and was regarded as one of 
the people who brought down the Soviet 

972
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,360
Union.
And so it's a masterpiece.

973
00:58:08,361 --> 00:58:09,980
That book,
and this is a complex issue,

974
00:58:09,981 --> 00:58:12,470
and to understand it,
you have to do that sort of reading.

975
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:15,260
But I want to tell you a little bit 
about what the law does.

976
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,273
And this is with regards to its 
interpretation from the policy 

977
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:19,394
guidelines.
It instantiates social constructionism 

978
00:58:21,891 --> 00:58:25,730
into our legal system.
You have to understand what that means.

979
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,880
There's a huge debate about how human 
identity is,

980
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:29,960
is,
is,

981
00:58:29,961 --> 00:58:30,794
um,
uh,

982
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,290
upon what grounds human identity is 
predicated.

983
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:34,363
Now the radical social constructionists 
basically say that identity is nothing 

984
00:58:37,701 --> 00:58:38,534
but a social construction and not that's
in keeping with their philosophical 

985
00:58:41,121 --> 00:58:43,010
doctrines.
Partly Marxist and Parsley,

986
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,230
partly postmodern,
but that isn't,

987
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,830
and that was what I was objecting to 
with regards to bill [inaudible] because

988
00:58:48,831 --> 00:58:50,990
it insists,
do you understand this?

989
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:55,460
It makes this legal doctrine,
that biological sex,

990
00:58:55,790 --> 00:59:00,080
gender identity,
gender expression and sexual orientation

991
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:05,170
very independently and they don't.
Now the reason they don't is because 98%

992
00:59:08,481 --> 00:59:11,150
of people,
it's 99.7% of people,

993
00:59:11,151 --> 00:59:11,984
by the way,
at least with regards to the most 

994
00:59:12,771 --> 00:59:15,110
credible statistics have a gender 
identity.

995
00:59:15,111 --> 00:59:15,944
This essentially identical with their 
biological sex and almost everybody who 

996
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:24,260
is male and female by sex and gender 
identity dresses that way.

997
00:59:24,261 --> 00:59:26,630
And that's what gender expression 
essentially is.

998
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,990
And then if you stack those three things
on top of each other,

999
00:59:29,991 --> 00:59:30,824
they're basically isomorphic.
You can add sexual orientation to that 

1000
00:59:33,531 --> 00:59:34,364
and 98% of people are heterosexual.
So the idea that those things very 

1001
00:59:37,371 --> 00:59:41,210
independently is absolutely 
preposterous,

1002
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:45,980
but it's written into the law and that 
has terrible consequences.

1003
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,750
You see,
I don't know,

1004
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:50,090
for example,
now to what degree,

1005
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:50,953
any discussion in universities of the 
biological differences between men and 

1006
00:59:53,541 --> 00:59:55,460
women are legal and you think,
oh,

1007
00:59:55,461 --> 00:59:57,230
well that's an exaggeration.
It's like,

1008
00:59:57,290 --> 01:00:00,170
well,
I debated Nicholas Matte,

1009
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,320
I believe that was his name.
A professor at the University of Toronto

1010
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,153
on TV owes the agenda and he said,
write out for everyone to hear that the 

1011
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:08,804
scientific consensus is that there's no 
biological differences between men and 

1012
01:00:12,051 --> 01:00:12,884
women.
And I've received letters from people 

1013
01:00:14,481 --> 01:00:15,314
who've told me that now the social 
justice activist types are complaining 

1014
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:22,820
about the fact that the biologists 
assign biological sex to animals because

1015
01:00:22,821 --> 01:00:26,120
it's only a social construct that we're 
projecting onto their being.

1016
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:27,410
And,
um,

1017
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,240
you know,
we just heard that the co,

1018
01:00:29,241 --> 01:00:32,180
the chromosomal level of analysis is 
complex.

1019
01:00:32,181 --> 01:00:33,014
It's not that complex.
What we have is a bi modal distribution 

1020
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:38,360
with a tiny number of exceptions in 
that,

1021
01:00:38,361 --> 01:00:40,070
by the way,
is not a spectrum.

1022
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,260
You see these words?

1023
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,760
We're up.
You'll have other questions.

1024
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:46,883
Nope.

1025
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,590
Uh,
professor Cossman,

1026
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:57,790
it just sort of picking up on some of 
the,

1027
01:00:57,830 --> 01:00:58,663
uh,
items that Professor Peterson just 

1028
01:01:00,391 --> 01:01:03,090
mentioned.
He was talking about social construction

1029
01:01:03,091 --> 01:01:03,920
is,
and then,

1030
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,540
uh,
the idea that this is a very novel,

1031
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:09,390
um,
issue when the law that like,

1032
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:10,560
you know,
that the uh,

1033
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:14,210
see 16 one of the concerns about it,
even if it isn't exactly,

1034
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,193
um,
the specific provisions of the 

1035
01:01:16,681 --> 01:01:17,514
legislation,
it's the fact that it's instantiating 

1036
01:01:19,531 --> 01:01:24,060
this kind of social construction into 
the realm of legal regulation.

1037
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,320
Do you,
you're,

1038
01:01:25,321 --> 01:01:26,154
you're an expert in law.
Do you have any thoughts or comments 

1039
01:01:28,441 --> 01:01:29,930
about that?
Um,

1040
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:32,880
I think that any of us who are experts 
in law would have something to say about

1041
01:01:32,881 --> 01:01:33,510
that.
Um,

1042
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:34,343
the law has been regulating social 
constructionism and social constructs 

1043
01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:39,030
since there was law,
um,

1044
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:40,830
language,
nationality,

1045
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:42,300
religion,
citizenship,

1046
01:01:42,301 --> 01:01:43,590
family,
marriage.

1047
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:44,910
There's no there,
there,

1048
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:45,843
there are social constructs are social 
constructs go to the very root of our 

1049
01:01:50,161 --> 01:01:51,210
common law,
tradition,

1050
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:52,830
property,
property,

1051
01:01:52,831 --> 01:01:53,461
law,
okay,

1052
01:01:53,461 --> 01:01:54,720
sure.
Property exists.

1053
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:56,010
It's there,
right?

1054
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:57,263
But the idea that we own it,
the idea that we own property is 

1055
01:02:00,571 --> 01:02:03,950
entirely socially constructed.
Um,

1056
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:07,560
intangible property futures,
contingent liabilities.

1057
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,780
Where are they?
I can't feel them.

1058
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:11,730
I can't feel them there.
Where are they?

1059
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:15,900
They're socially constructed.
These are the things that law regulates.

1060
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,820
Um,
let me talk about one that you know,

1061
01:02:17,821 --> 01:02:20,010
that Professor Peterson is,
is quite fond

1062
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,730
of.
Um,

1063
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:21,563
the right to freedom of expression.
This is entirely a social construction 

1064
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:26,303
of the enlightenment.
It didn't exist before the 

1065
01:02:27,991 --> 01:02:29,160
enlightenment,
um,

1066
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,293
of humanism and of liberalism.
It depends on our understanding of 

1067
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:34,104
democracy.
It depends on our understanding of what 

1068
01:02:36,001 --> 01:02:36,834
a right is.
It depends on our understanding of what 

1069
01:02:38,581 --> 01:02:39,414
a freedom is.
And it depends on our understanding of 

1070
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:41,844
what expression is.
The idea that the law regulates social 

1071
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:46,584
constructs is beyond irrelevant.
It doesn't tell us anything about good 

1072
01:02:52,831 --> 01:02:55,530
social constructs and bad social 
constructs.

1073
01:02:55,531 --> 01:02:59,400
It doesn't tell us anything about good 
laws versus bad laws.

1074
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:00,533
And one of the things that Professor 
Peterson seems to misunderstand is this 

1075
01:03:05,461 --> 01:03:10,461
difference between the law as it is and 
the law as he might like it to be.

1076
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:14,130
I have lots of disagreements with the 
law as it is,

1077
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:15,173
but what I've come and done here today 
is explained to you what the law is 

1078
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:24,750
today and you might criticize it,
but that's just what the law is.

1079
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:25,883
And it disturbs me profoundly that 
Professor Peterson without arguments or 

1080
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:35,100
support has done effectively a post 
truth claim on me.

1081
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,560
He has basically said,
you're wrong.

1082
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:40,380
There's no arguments,
there's no evidence,

1083
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:41,243
there's no support.
That my description of what the law is 

1084
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:49,290
as a 30 year expert in this field is 
simply wrong.

1085
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:50,970
Um,
you know,

1086
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:51,983
I don't think it's wrong.
I have some opinions on maybe how the 

1087
01:03:53,761 --> 01:03:56,590
law ought to be,
but what I've done is I've common,

1088
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:57,453
I've described how it is.
There's also I think a very important 

1089
01:03:59,971 --> 01:04:03,780
distinction that's being missed here 
about the penalties that are attached to

1090
01:04:03,781 --> 01:04:06,450
different laws.
Criminal laws involve imprisonment.

1091
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:09,360
Civil laws involve damages and 
restitution.

1092
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:10,703
An Ontario Human Rights Commission 
offense will result in a financial or a 

1093
01:04:14,371 --> 01:04:17,670
non financial penalty such as rehiring 
or training.

1094
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,550
So what happens if a person refuses to 
pay the fine?

1095
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:24,180
You don't get to go to jail.
I'm sorry.

1096
01:04:24,181 --> 01:04:25,470
You don't.
Um,

1097
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,410
the mechanisms of civil enforcement come
into effect.

1098
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:29,483
The two most common forms of enforcing 
judgements are seizure and sale of 

1099
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:33,624
assets.
And if your assets do not sufficiently 

1100
01:04:37,051 --> 01:04:40,680
cover the fine,
then your wages will be garnished.

1101
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,680
It's about money.
So yes,

1102
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:46,500
it's true.
Your assets might be seized,

1103
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:50,850
your income might be garnished,
but you don't get to go to jail.

1104
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:52,613
Huh.

1105
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:57,830
[inaudible]

1106
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:00,763
um,
so we'll go back now to professor 

1107
01:05:02,151 --> 01:05:05,090
Peterson cause there were two segments 
that we've agreed that we,

1108
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:05,953
we'd go back to him.
And actually I think you were just 

1109
01:05:07,611 --> 01:05:09,530
starting at the end of your,
um,

1110
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:10,453
of your discussion in your answer to the
last question to talk a little bit 

1111
01:05:13,581 --> 01:05:14,330
about,
uh,

1112
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:17,710
some of the points that professor Bryson
made your,

1113
01:05:17,711 --> 01:05:18,544
your picture of gender and,
and the relationship between sex and 

1114
01:05:21,971 --> 01:05:25,090
gender in some of those issues.
And um,

1115
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,110
you know,
she,

1116
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:30,180
she lays out some of the science and 
some of the actual scientific findings,

1117
01:05:30,181 --> 01:05:31,480
um,
around those,

1118
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:34,990
around those issues.
And I wonder when you,

1119
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:37,240
when you take a look at some of that 
research,

1120
01:05:37,241 --> 01:05:39,520
does it,
how does it affect your,

1121
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:41,820
your thinking on some of these questions
about,

1122
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:42,963
in particular the point some people 
think of as perhaps a rather simplified 

1123
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:47,700
picture of sex and gender

1124
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:48,170
there.
Okay.

1125
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:49,100
Well,
a couple of things.

1126
01:05:49,101 --> 01:05:52,010
The first thing I do,
I want to make a quick comment about,

1127
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:53,203
um,
Dr Crossman's critique of my analysis 

1128
01:05:55,581 --> 01:05:56,414
because she actually didn't address it.
I didn't say that the law shouldn't 

1129
01:06:00,021 --> 01:06:03,290
regulate social constructions.
That's what the law does.

1130
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,320
That's what she said.
That isn't what I said.

1131
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:12,010
I said that the law now builds in a 
social constructionist doctrine into the

1132
01:06:12,411 --> 01:06:15,200
fabric of the law.
That's not the same thing.

1133
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:16,183
Obviously the law regulates property 
rates in all of that and to some degree 

1134
01:06:19,191 --> 01:06:20,024
those are social constructions,
although not to the degree that she 

1135
01:06:21,651 --> 01:06:23,930
claims,
but this is a whole different thing.

1136
01:06:23,931 --> 01:06:24,764
This builds in a philosophy I've 
identity and one of the things that 

1137
01:06:26,721 --> 01:06:27,554
builds in for example,
is the claim that identity is only 

1138
01:06:29,391 --> 01:06:31,940
subjectively defined and that's built 
right in.

1139
01:06:31,941 --> 01:06:34,880
It says that your identity is whatever 
you think it is.

1140
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:36,020
Well,
let me tell you,

1141
01:06:36,021 --> 01:06:39,530
as a practicing psychologist,
that's absolute rubbish.

1142
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:44,810
Your identity to look when,
when children are two years old,

1143
01:06:44,811 --> 01:06:48,230
that's what they think.
They think that their subjective reality

1144
01:06:48,231 --> 01:06:49,064
is everything.
And what you do is you socialize them 

1145
01:06:50,511 --> 01:06:51,344
between the ages of two and four to 
adopt an identity that's part of a 

1146
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:55,844
cultural negotiation.
It's like your identity as part of a 

1147
01:06:57,741 --> 01:06:58,574
cultural negotiation.
It's partly the game you play in partly 

1148
01:07:00,771 --> 01:07:04,970
the game that I play with you and I have
to be a voluntary participant in that.

1149
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,510
And not only,
not only is it not subjectively defined,

1150
01:07:08,511 --> 01:07:10,400
which detaches it entirely,
by the way,

1151
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:11,234
from the underlying biological and the 
underlying objective reality making any 

1152
01:07:14,871 --> 01:07:17,450
claim you want for your subjective 
identity.

1153
01:07:17,451 --> 01:07:20,420
Valid.
The other thing it does is,

1154
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:21,583
um,

1155
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:25,983
it did completely oblivious.
It's the idea that identity is actually 

1156
01:07:28,991 --> 01:07:33,790
a Prac pragmatic entity for God's sake.
It's like if you're a lawyer or a father

1157
01:07:33,791 --> 01:07:34,624
or mother,
like an identity that has some solidity 

1158
01:07:36,461 --> 01:07:37,360
to it,
say,

1159
01:07:37,361 --> 01:07:38,830
well,
for most lawyers anyways,

1160
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:39,963
so I'm sorry I couldn't help it.
Your identity is also a vehicle within 

1161
01:07:48,881 --> 01:07:50,440
which you traveled through life,
right?

1162
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:53,470
It's a set of tools,
a set of pragmatic tools that you use to

1163
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,840
interact with the social and the natural
world.

1164
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:59,080
It's not only your subjective whim.
So,

1165
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,140
okay.
And so with regards to the science,

1166
01:08:02,141 --> 01:08:04,690
it's like really,
you know,

1167
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:07,810
I can give you just one example and oh 
and I'll start with this and hopefully I

1168
01:08:07,811 --> 01:08:12,010
can do it quickly.
The idea of gender identity,

1169
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:14,320
which is only defined subjectively in,
in the,

1170
01:08:14,321 --> 01:08:15,154
in the relevant law has been studied 
intensively by personality psychologist 

1171
01:08:17,811 --> 01:08:18,530
such as myself.

1172
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,030
In fact,
my lab has done some of the,

1173
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:22,400
I wouldn't say the most fundamental 
research on it,

1174
01:08:22,401 --> 01:08:23,234
but you know,
we're in the boat and we're in the 

1175
01:08:23,841 --> 01:08:25,760
ballpark.
Here's a little story.

1176
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:27,500
Okay.
So the,

1177
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,860
the differences between personality 
between men and women are basically what

1178
01:08:30,861 --> 01:08:31,694
constitutes gender identity.
And in so far as it's not merely 

1179
01:08:33,711 --> 01:08:36,020
subjective.
And one of the things that's happened is

1180
01:08:36,021 --> 01:08:36,854
that as the Scandinavian countries have 
equalized their political and 

1181
01:08:39,921 --> 01:08:40,754
sociological landscape,
the differences in identity between men 

1182
01:08:44,001 --> 01:08:46,760
and women have got larger,
not smaller.

1183
01:08:46,761 --> 01:08:47,594
Do you understand that?
That's a refutation of the social 

1184
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:50,963
constructionist claim.
So what happens is that if you flatten 

1185
01:08:54,051 --> 01:08:58,250
out the landscape so that there are very
few socioeconomic differences say,

1186
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:01,070
or sociological differences in the 
treatment between men and women,

1187
01:09:01,071 --> 01:09:04,610
what happens is the biological 
difference maximizes,

1188
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:08,960
it maximizes the understand that means 
men and women get more different,

1189
01:09:08,961 --> 01:09:09,794
not more the same.
And the thing about women in the 

1190
01:09:11,511 --> 01:09:12,344
audience,
bloody hell you should think about this 

1191
01:09:13,641 --> 01:09:16,760
because don't you want to pursue the 
things that you're interested in?

1192
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:19,100
And if you pursue the things that you're
interested in,

1193
01:09:19,101 --> 01:09:21,110
cause you're interested in different 
things than men,

1194
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:23,420
I'm telling Ya.
And if you look at the interest,

1195
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:27,290
if you look at the interest variation,
this has been established technically.

1196
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:28,124
If you look at the interest variation,
there's almost no overlap between men 

1197
01:09:30,591 --> 01:09:31,424
and women.
If you sum up the differences in 

1198
01:09:32,661 --> 01:09:34,070
interest,
interest in temperament.

1199
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:36,350
Okay.

1200
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:37,183
No.

1201
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:46,253
So I think that this provides perhaps a 
good segway pat back to a professor 

1202
01:09:50,761 --> 01:09:51,770
Bryson.
Um,

1203
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:55,250
just to talk a little bit,
um,

1204
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,113
uh,
but about some of the claims about in 

1205
01:09:57,991 --> 01:09:59,250
particular,
um,

1206
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,150
you know,
what,

1207
01:10:00,150 --> 01:10:03,270
what does some of the evidence,
what does some of the,

1208
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:04,123
um,
whether it's sort of the objective 

1209
01:10:05,731 --> 01:10:08,920
realities in this situation that we 
might hold on to

1210
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:14,490
one objective reality is what happens 
when you stop reading.

1211
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:15,773
So I'm going to recommend that for 
anyone who's interested in a current 

1212
01:10:20,221 --> 01:10:22,860
review of the literature on sex,
gender,

1213
01:10:22,861 --> 01:10:23,694
and gender differences,
that you take a look at Rebecca Jordan 

1214
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:27,923
Young or an fosto sterling who provide 
extraordinary and very detailed reviews 

1215
01:10:32,251 --> 01:10:33,084
of this literature.
And actually it comes down to the fact 

1216
01:10:35,791 --> 01:10:40,110
that science about causality,
about in essence,

1217
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:40,944
sex being linked and producing gender 
requires us to move outside of the 

1218
01:10:45,511 --> 01:10:46,344
current realm.
All we have in this realm is quite high 

1219
01:10:48,721 --> 01:10:49,554
experimentation.
We can't actually do studies where we 

1220
01:10:52,561 --> 01:10:55,980
manipulate the chromosome or the 
hormonal environment.

1221
01:10:56,280 --> 01:11:01,280
And so since we can't remove sexism and 
misogyny from the production of gender,

1222
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:05,700
we can actually reach conclusions about 
what we take to be gender differences.

1223
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:10,530
And so although it plays really well on 
the cover of people magazine,

1224
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:12,300
brain sex,
or whatever,

1225
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:13,383
a kind of arm chairs science that we 
want to rely on for cocktail party Chit 

1226
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:21,360
Chat,
this is not the stuff of nature.

1227
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:24,540
And by nature I don't mean something 
that we take for granted.

1228
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:26,790
I mean the peer reviewed academic 
journal.

1229
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:27,863
So it's really good to keep reading if 
you're going to be employed at a great 

1230
01:11:32,401 --> 01:11:37,401
Canadian university
point to pronouns.

1231
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,710
Let's put pronouns in some kind of 
context.

1232
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:41,843
And I think it's really helpful in going
back to what Justice Minister Wilson 

1233
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:47,123
Raybould said yesterday,
following the passing of [inaudible] 16 

1234
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:50,423
and I'll quote,
it's our collective responsibility to 

1235
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:53,874
recognize and reduce the vulnerability 
of Trans gender diverse person's to 

1236
01:11:57,421 --> 01:12:00,870
discrimination,
hate crimes and hate propaganda.

1237
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:04,650
And a lot of what we've been hearing 
here is hate propaganda.

1238
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:05,843
So what I want to say about pronouns is 
that we have to get beyond this 

1239
01:12:09,231 --> 01:12:12,600
simplistic discussion,
which is either about grammatical,

1240
01:12:12,601 --> 01:12:14,790
infelicity,
singular plural,

1241
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:15,923
or that we should be nice to people.
We actually have to deal with our 

1242
01:12:20,101 --> 01:12:20,934
responsibility in creating institutional
climates that take very seriously the 

1243
01:12:25,681 --> 01:12:27,540
goal of reducing inequality.

1244
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:31,140
That has always been the fundamental 
goal of education.

1245
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,480
So at the University of British 
Columbia,

1246
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:34,523
the trends to spirit and gender 
diversity task force is looking at 

1247
01:12:37,831 --> 01:12:38,664
everything in the context of what Greg 
Bower and her amazing colleagues at 

1248
01:12:42,121 --> 01:12:47,040
Trans Paul's call institutional and 
informational eraser.

1249
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:50,520
We are looking at housing,
student health,

1250
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:51,533
how were trans and gender diverse 
students going to go to student health 

1251
01:12:54,631 --> 01:12:58,920
and get care that is both medically and 
culturally competent.

1252
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:00,053
How should we be organizing student 
information systems so that people can 

1253
01:13:04,021 --> 01:13:04,854
tell us their names and their pronouns?
This is a technical challenge only and 

1254
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:11,250
we have to rise to the challenge.

1255
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:12,320
Okay,

1256
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,720
thank you.
So now I know that there is much,

1257
01:13:14,721 --> 01:13:15,554
much more to say an ever,
but I have some questions from the 

1258
01:13:18,021 --> 01:13:20,790
audience.
So I'd like to read those and,

1259
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:22,440
and I'll try again,
uh,

1260
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:23,293
just to divide up the time and the 
questions are hopefully as fairly as 

1261
01:13:26,871 --> 01:13:28,310
possible.
Um,

1262
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:31,310
so professor Peterson,
let's start with you.

1263
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,840
Uh,
so this question says,

1264
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:34,303
you present your issue with bill,
see 16 to be that the infringement of 

1265
01:13:37,971 --> 01:13:40,530
freedom of expression regarding gender 
pronouns.

1266
01:13:40,531 --> 01:13:41,364
See as a problem.
Do you hold the same stance with other 

1267
01:13:43,971 --> 01:13:44,804
discriminatory language and the human 
rights code such as being able to use 

1268
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,633
racist terms with regard to students?
And if you believe that one of these 

1269
01:13:54,501 --> 01:13:57,140
things is a violation but not the other 
one.

1270
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,033
Why?
I'm not sure I read that over all that 

1271
01:13:59,331 --> 01:14:00,164
well,
but

1272
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,450
okay.
So one,

1273
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:02,343
one thing I would like to point out 
before I answer that just so you will 

1274
01:14:04,861 --> 01:14:09,861
notice is that I have in fact been 
denounced today and what I am saying has

1275
01:14:10,541 --> 01:14:15,541
in fact described as hate propaganda.
So one thing I'd like to suggest to you,

1276
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,300
every single person in the audience 
you're next.

1277
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:24,040
So keep it in mind.
All right.

1278
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:28,830
So with regards to the question,
well first of all,

1279
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,510
I don't think that these issues are the 
same.

1280
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:35,840
I don't think they're the same at all.
I mean,

1281
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:38,420
I think being thinking about the pronoun
thing,

1282
01:14:38,421 --> 01:14:40,070
you know,
because one of the things that people,

1283
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:41,093
uh,
it put me back on my heels for a while 

1284
01:14:42,381 --> 01:14:44,330
because the claim was basically,
well,

1285
01:14:44,331 --> 01:14:46,920
it's something like why doesn't the mean
professor just play nice and,

1286
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:49,310
and respect people by using their 
pronouns?

1287
01:14:49,311 --> 01:14:50,144
And it took me like three weeks to 
unpack that because who gets questioned 

1288
01:14:52,761 --> 01:14:53,594
about Pronoun use?
I don't know why the hell I use the 

1289
01:14:54,861 --> 01:14:55,694
pronouns I use,
I use them because they're part of the 

1290
01:14:56,901 --> 01:14:58,160
language I use.
He and she,

1291
01:14:58,161 --> 01:15:01,190
because that's what everyone uses.
And so then I had to think about,

1292
01:15:01,191 --> 01:15:03,740
well why,
why do we in fact use pronouns?

1293
01:15:03,741 --> 01:15:06,980
And we use them in part for the same 
reason that we use other categories.

1294
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:09,590
And that's to simplify the world for 
functional purposes.

1295
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:11,900
Roughly speaking.
But then I was thinking,

1296
01:15:11,901 --> 01:15:12,734
well,
is the use of he and she a mark of 

1297
01:15:14,151 --> 01:15:15,920
respect?
And the answer to that is,

1298
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:16,611
well,
no,

1299
01:15:16,611 --> 01:15:17,444
it's not a mark of respect.
It can't be a mark of what you call 4 

1300
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:23,540
billion people.
Can't be a mark of respect.

1301
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:24,050
Right.
It's,

1302
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:27,680
it's a mark of basic categorization.
And so then the claim comes up,

1303
01:15:27,681 --> 01:15:30,410
well if someone wants you to use a 
particular Pronoun,

1304
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:32,420
then you're disrespecting them.
If you don't,

1305
01:15:32,421 --> 01:15:33,254
it's like,
hmm,

1306
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:35,120
okay,
let's think that through a bit.

1307
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:37,640
Well that assumes that when I'm using he
or she for,

1308
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:38,533
for people and you know,
in normal parlance that I'm actually 

1309
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:43,250
indicating my respect for them.
And that's not true.

1310
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:44,890
It's like if I don't know you,
I,

1311
01:15:44,891 --> 01:15:49,580
Claudius classify you generically and 
basically I classify you in terms of how

1312
01:15:49,581 --> 01:15:51,260
you present yourself publicly.

1313
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:52,093
I suppose that's your gender expression 
and then I nail you with whatever 

1314
01:15:55,311 --> 01:15:57,980
pronoun and seems to fit.
It has nothing to do with respect.

1315
01:15:57,981 --> 01:15:58,814
And besides that,
you bloody well don't get to demand my 

1316
01:16:00,861 --> 01:16:02,570
respect.
Why should you,

1317
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:03,771
you know,
I mean,

1318
01:16:03,771 --> 01:16:06,770
it's not like I respect everyone.
That's a foolish thing to do.

1319
01:16:06,771 --> 01:16:09,410
You respect people who were respectable.
You know,

1320
01:16:09,411 --> 01:16:10,244
you,
you make value distinctions between 

1321
01:16:11,511 --> 01:16:14,840
people and that doesn't mean you 
illegally discriminate against them.

1322
01:16:14,841 --> 01:16:18,050
Those aren't the same thing.
But I'm all for value judgments.

1323
01:16:18,051 --> 01:16:19,820
If,
if you don't buy value judgments,

1324
01:16:19,821 --> 01:16:21,980
then why bother learning anything?
Why,

1325
01:16:21,981 --> 01:16:22,814
why bother doing anything?
Why go from one point in your life to 

1326
01:16:25,521 --> 01:16:28,550
another if the next point isn't better 
in some manner?

1327
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:29,803
So on telling me that I'm not respecting
people and I don't use their gender 

1328
01:16:32,211 --> 01:16:33,044
pronouns.
And the other thing is I don't buy this 

1329
01:16:34,791 --> 01:16:35,624
whole idea that the people who are 
putting this legislation forward are 

1330
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:41,300
valid representatives of the Trans 
community.

1331
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:42,223
That's what they say they are.
We have mechanisms for deciding whether 

1332
01:16:45,141 --> 01:16:45,974
someone's a valid representative of a 
community and that generally involves 

1333
01:16:48,381 --> 01:16:49,214
democratic voting.
I've received at least 20 letters from 

1334
01:16:51,801 --> 01:16:54,500
transsexual people who are on my side 
and by the way,

1335
01:16:54,501 --> 01:16:56,690
zero from others,
believe it or not,

1336
01:16:56,930 --> 01:17:00,170
who are perfectly happy with the idea of
gendered pronouns.

1337
01:17:00,171 --> 01:17:03,890
It's just they want to be the other one.
Now you can have a discussion about that

1338
01:17:03,891 --> 01:17:05,540
and there's lots of things to be said 
about it,

1339
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:06,374
but the idea that this community that's 
coming out in these demanding rights is 

1340
01:17:09,621 --> 01:17:09,980
somehow

1341
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:13,130
representative of this homogenous dough 
press minority,

1342
01:17:13,131 --> 01:17:14,240
I think is rubbish.

1343
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,780
Well that leads us to our next

1344
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:17,773
question.

1345
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:26,973
Question.
I'm going to ask both the professor 

1346
01:17:29,231 --> 01:17:32,560
cossman and professor Bryson to comment 
on it.

1347
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:33,783
Um,
so one of the objectives of the 

1348
01:17:34,961 --> 01:17:35,794
transgender and queer rights movement is
to enter into public conscience in a 

1349
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:42,610
way.
And this person asks,

1350
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:45,640
this can only occur through public 
conversation.

1351
01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:47,163
Do you worry that it's,
it may not be possible to have 

1352
01:17:49,691 --> 01:17:50,524
thoughtful discussion if there is 
government restriction about this kind 

1353
01:17:54,221 --> 01:17:56,950
of speech.
And do you worry that it would skew,

1354
01:17:56,951 --> 01:18:00,580
discuss discussion in one direction or 
another?

1355
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:02,200
Uh,
still perhaps.

1356
01:18:02,201 --> 01:18:05,220
So professor cossman first and then 
professor Bryson.

1357
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:08,113
Okay.

1358
01:18:08,430 --> 01:18:13,140
So I've spent a career being concerned 
about the way in which,

1359
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:15,740
um,
thoughtful discussion is often shut down

1360
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:18,300
and I've been concerned about it on the 
right,

1361
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,193
I think concerned about it on the left 
and I've been concerned about it in the 

1362
01:18:21,181 --> 01:18:23,160
mushy middle.
And,

1363
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:24,203
and I think that Professor Peterson has 
actually performed some of this today 

1364
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:28,193
and so far as he just said that he was 
denounced here today and that they're 

1365
01:18:32,281 --> 01:18:33,114
going to come for you next.
So the thing is about speech is it 

1366
01:18:36,601 --> 01:18:41,400
everybody gets it and you say something 
and you then get criticized.

1367
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:44,400
So professor Peterson hasn't been 
denounced.

1368
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:46,080
Some might want to,
um,

1369
01:18:46,081 --> 01:18:51,081
but he has been severely criticized and 
that is actually what speech does.

1370
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:51,880
That

1371
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:53,260
is what speech does.

1372
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:57,720
I think that,
um,

1373
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:01,410
I think that there is an important way 
to have public discussions,

1374
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:03,900
um,
around a whole range of issues.

1375
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:08,670
I would welcome a discussion on the role
of hate speech provisions.

1376
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:09,833
I would welcome a discussion around the 
role of hate speech and its 

1377
01:19:13,441 --> 01:19:15,280
desirability,
um,

1378
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:16,143
about whether the Supreme Court of 
Canada is right or not right in 

1379
01:19:19,831 --> 01:19:20,664
upholding its constitutionality.
But I would like to have that debate 

1380
01:19:24,270 --> 01:19:27,030
with someone who is knowledgeable about 
the law.

1381
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:32,960
Thank you.

1382
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,250
And Professor Bryson,

1383
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:37,893
one of the big questions that I had to 
deal with in considering whether or not 

1384
01:19:41,801 --> 01:19:42,634
to accept a very generous offer,
a invitation of the University of 

1385
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:53,100
Toronto to come here today would be the 
impact of this event on Trans and gender

1386
01:19:54,221 --> 01:19:56,030
non binary people,
uh,

1387
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:00,280
specifically at the University of 
Toronto and much more generally.

1388
01:20:00,790 --> 01:20:01,623
And so whereas I would say that I 
recognize practices of peer review and 

1389
01:20:07,651 --> 01:20:12,651
practices of peer review are not 
denouncement practices of peer review,

1390
01:20:12,871 --> 01:20:17,430
our practices that we utilize to make 
assessments about knowledge claims.

1391
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:18,803
Whereas I would fully appreciate being 
able to enter into a discussion about 

1392
01:20:23,461 --> 01:20:24,294
gender and gender identity and issues 
around trans culture as a means of 

1393
01:20:29,911 --> 01:20:30,744
practicing peer review.
I think the difficulty that we've had 

1394
01:20:34,351 --> 01:20:37,680
and we've managed to reproduce this 
difficulty here today,

1395
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:38,993
uh,
characterized just now by Dr. Peterson 

1396
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:45,030
as simplifying the world for functional 
purposes,

1397
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:46,163
simplifying the world for functional 
purposes is not what I recognize to be 

1398
01:20:49,351 --> 01:20:50,640
academic practice.

1399
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:51,713
This is not how we relate to knowledge.
And so I think that there's a concern 

1400
01:20:56,460 --> 01:21:01,440
when we don't subject claims that are 
being made as knowledge claims by people

1401
01:21:01,441 --> 01:21:04,500
who carry titles at great Canadian 
universities.

1402
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:05,723
When we don't treat those knowledge 
claims in the same way that we would in 

1403
01:21:08,551 --> 01:21:09,384
any other field.
And when their knowledge claims made 

1404
01:21:11,821 --> 01:21:16,140
about members of minority groups and 
bottled vulnerable,

1405
01:21:16,350 --> 01:21:21,350
marginalized members of minority groups,
then I think that we all need to be very

1406
01:21:21,721 --> 01:21:22,554
concerned about how it is that we're 
changing what we think we do in the 

1407
01:21:25,861 --> 01:21:26,694
university,
which is supposed to be about the 

1408
01:21:28,711 --> 01:21:30,840
advancement of knowledge and excellence.

1409
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:32,783
Thank you.

1410
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:37,193
Okay.

1411
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:39,950
So it was sort of a slightly different 
uh,

1412
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:41,810
line,
but back to you,

1413
01:21:41,811 --> 01:21:46,811
Professor Peterson again from the 
audience as a clinical psychologist,

1414
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:50,210
refute it is Professor Peterson,
sorry.

1415
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:51,373
As a clinical psychologist refusing to 
acknowledge how damaging it could 

1416
01:21:54,651 --> 01:21:58,340
potentially be to an individual to 
disregard their identity.

1417
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:00,673
Um,
the first thing I would like to say to 

1418
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:04,750
Mary Bryson is that this is an 
invitation.

1419
01:22:04,751 --> 01:22:09,190
If she would like to debate,
if she would like to debate,

1420
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:10,083
um,
the relationship between biology and 

1421
01:22:12,671 --> 01:22:13,504
gender identity,
I'm extending her an invitation to do 

1422
01:22:15,671 --> 01:22:16,504
so.
I'm sure that any number of student 

1423
01:22:18,371 --> 01:22:20,320
groups would be more than happy to host 
it.

1424
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:21,453
And I'll put my knowledge of the peer 
reviewed literature against her 

1425
01:22:23,591 --> 01:22:25,720
knowledge.
Here we go to the question though.

1426
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:28,960
Um,
identities,

1427
01:22:28,961 --> 01:22:29,794
a very complicated thing and you know,
when I engage in clinical discussions 

1428
01:22:32,471 --> 01:22:34,390
with my clients,
it's all about their identity.

1429
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:35,583
And so the idea that it's a very 
difficult question to even engage with 

1430
01:22:38,801 --> 01:22:42,550
because I don't understand it's,
I don't understand it.

1431
01:22:42,551 --> 01:22:45,760
It makes things so simple that you can't
discuss them properly.

1432
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:46,803
All I do in my clinical practice and I 
have about 20,000 hours of experience 

1433
01:22:49,991 --> 01:22:53,950
with clinical in my clinical practice 
and I've dealt with all sorts of people,

1434
01:22:54,130 --> 01:22:57,790
far more variation people than the 
typical person ever encounters.

1435
01:22:57,790 --> 01:22:58,623
And I think I've done it at least 
reasonably competently all my 

1436
01:23:01,571 --> 01:23:04,750
discussions with people in my clinical 
practice or about their identity,

1437
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,570
given the definition of identity that I 
brought forth,

1438
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:10,390
how they feel about themselves,
how they conceptualize themselves.

1439
01:23:10,391 --> 01:23:13,720
Cause those are two different things.
How that plays out in their interactions

1440
01:23:13,721 --> 01:23:14,554
with other people and what the 
functional significance of that isn't 

1441
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:19,840
arm I'm going to save forthrightly.
Well two things.

1442
01:23:19,841 --> 01:23:23,980
One is that I don't believe that any of 
my clients have had cause to worry about

1443
01:23:23,981 --> 01:23:27,320
my interpretation of their identity.
Because what I do in my practice is help

1444
01:23:27,321 --> 01:23:29,320
them discover what that is.
I'm really,

1445
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:33,700
I'm seriously not interested in imposing
any ideas of identity onto someone.

1446
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,460
It's because I don't,
I can't do that.

1447
01:23:36,461 --> 01:23:40,210
I don't know what the right vehicle is 
for you to travel through life.

1448
01:23:40,211 --> 01:23:42,280
What I can help you do is articulate 
your concerns.

1449
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:45,070
I can ask you questions where I see 
contradictions in yourself.

1450
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:45,963
Articulation.
I can help you make plans for the 

1451
01:23:47,621 --> 01:23:48,454
future.
And I've helped thousands and thousands 

1452
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:52,600
and thousands of people by the way,
make plans for the future with the stuff

1453
01:23:52,601 --> 01:23:53,434
that I do online.
And so I'm helping people build a 

1454
01:23:55,361 --> 01:23:57,200
genuine identity.
Um,

1455
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:58,780
well,
and that's what I do.

1456
01:23:58,870 --> 01:24:02,710
So that's the answer to that question 
and I think I do it well.

1457
01:24:02,711 --> 01:24:03,544
I mean in the stuff we've done from a 
research perspective with the future 

1458
01:24:06,011 --> 01:24:06,844
authoring program,
which I offered to people free and week 

1459
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,530
and a half ago,
to help them catalyze their identities.

1460
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:12,753
We've helped 5,000 university students 
increase their grade point average 20% 

1461
01:24:17,231 --> 01:24:18,064
and decrease their dropout by the same.
And the biggest effect have it's been 

1462
01:24:21,011 --> 01:24:24,190
with men and,
and non Western ethnic minority students

1463
01:24:24,191 --> 01:24:28,720
who've accelerated their performance up 
beyond the range of the normal for the,

1464
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:31,720
for the dominant culture,
a pure psychological intervention,

1465
01:24:31,721 --> 01:24:33,790
I might say,
a a sociological intervention.

1466
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:34,893
So I'm perfectly willing to stack my 
record on identity formulation up 

1467
01:24:38,111 --> 01:24:41,350
against anyone so and so,
and I should also point out,

1468
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:42,483
I think where I'm most vulnerable in 
this entire debate and I expect this 

1469
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:46,023
will happen and you know,
there's already been noise about it on 

1470
01:24:47,561 --> 01:24:49,720
the Ontario Psychological Association 
website.

1471
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:50,853
I think they'll,
that they'll probably come after my 

1472
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:54,970
clinical license so that,
that'd be my,

1473
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:56,640
that'd be my guess.
So.

1474
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:57,400
So

1475
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,400
I think we might be straying a little 
away from your question.

1476
01:25:00,401 --> 01:25:01,234
No.
So,

1477
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:02,260
uh,
just uh,

1478
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:03,310
thank you.
Um,

1479
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:04,503
so

1480
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,570
no,
we're doing because that,

1481
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:07,113
that question

1482
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,433
question involved my clinical practice,
I'm not straying a bit that involve my 

1483
01:25:12,101 --> 01:25:14,500
clinical practice.
And there was a reason that the question

1484
01:25:14,501 --> 01:25:16,580
was posed.
So I'm not straying.

1485
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:18,553
Thank you.

1486
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:26,063
Um,
the next question concerns how a free 

1487
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:32,720
and democratic society is,
uh,

1488
01:25:32,721 --> 01:25:33,554
how that idea is developed in this is I 
guess particularly our for Professor 

1489
01:25:38,851 --> 01:25:40,890
Cossman.
So you mentioned that,

1490
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:42,130
um,
the uh,

1491
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:43,013
freedom of expression and the 
antidiscrimination equality provisions 

1492
01:25:46,711 --> 01:25:49,590
of the charter are balanced through 
section one,

1493
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:53,730
which explicitly it's section one starts
out our charter.

1494
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:54,843
Um,
and it has this idea of free and 

1495
01:25:55,741 --> 01:25:58,110
democratic society.
So how,

1496
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:02,160
how is that idea established and who was
part of that discussion?

1497
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:09,400
So the language of section one is that 
all rights and freedoms contained in the

1498
01:26:09,651 --> 01:26:10,484
charter are subject to such reasonable 
limits as are demonstrably justifiable 

1499
01:26:14,301 --> 01:26:17,030
in a free and democratic society.
So like,

1500
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:19,550
I didn't write those right?
Wasn't me.

1501
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:20,683
Um,
it was a whole bunch of folks back in 

1502
01:26:23,901 --> 01:26:24,734
the late seventies and the early 1980s 
where there was a constitutional 

1503
01:26:29,301 --> 01:26:33,380
committees that decided what the 
Canadian constitution would be.

1504
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,840
It was parliament,
it was the Senate,

1505
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:38,840
it was all the provinces with the 
exception of Quebec of course.

1506
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:39,993
Um,
that came to an agreement that the 

1507
01:26:42,441 --> 01:26:45,680
constitution would be our highest form 
of law.

1508
01:26:46,220 --> 01:26:48,500
And it's also important,
there's a,

1509
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:50,900
there's a lot of misunderstanding around
the constitution.

1510
01:26:50,901 --> 01:26:55,460
So the constitution only restricts 
government action.

1511
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:59,210
It is not what's at play here in terms 
of uh,

1512
01:26:59,211 --> 01:27:00,520
universities.
In fact,

1513
01:27:00,530 --> 01:27:02,510
the charter doesn't actually apply to 
universities.

1514
01:27:02,630 --> 01:27:05,570
Human rights codes do,
but the charter does not.

1515
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:06,853
Um,
and so the courts from the very early 

1516
01:27:08,721 --> 01:27:10,670
times of when the Supreme Court of 
Canada,

1517
01:27:10,671 --> 01:27:13,670
when it had to start interpret all the 
charter rights,

1518
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:15,830
there's section two B,
that's freedom of expression.

1519
01:27:15,831 --> 01:27:16,664
There's freedom of religion.
There's the right to be free from 

1520
01:27:18,351 --> 01:27:20,900
unreasonable search and seizure.
There's the right to life,

1521
01:27:20,901 --> 01:27:23,540
liberty and security of the person.
There's the right to equality.

1522
01:27:23,541 --> 01:27:24,374
Before the law,
the Supreme Court of Canada developed a 

1523
01:27:27,261 --> 01:27:32,261
test whereby it said it was going to 
figure out how to balance rights.

1524
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:37,220
And so if you have a violation of 
section two be freedom of expression,

1525
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:39,110
which is,
which is quite a low bar,

1526
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:42,680
anything that restricts speech is 
considered to be a violation of that,

1527
01:27:42,681 --> 01:27:43,514
right?
You then move to section one and the 

1528
01:27:45,891 --> 01:27:49,010
court in a very early case called the 
oaks case,

1529
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:54,370
developed a test whereby it,
it does that balancing first it looks to

1530
01:27:54,381 --> 01:27:58,640
see whether there are any pressing and 
substantial objectives in the government

1531
01:27:58,641 --> 01:28:02,510
legislation that actually is limiting 
those rights.

1532
01:28:02,930 --> 01:28:03,763
It then looks at if there are pressing 
and substantial objectives and often in 

1533
01:28:07,461 --> 01:28:09,110
the context of hate speech,
for example,

1534
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:12,350
that is about preventing discrimination,
but there's many others as well.

1535
01:28:12,730 --> 01:28:13,563
Um,
it then looks to see whether the 

1536
01:28:14,571 --> 01:28:15,404
violation of the speech is proportionate
to the pressing and substantial 

1537
01:28:20,121 --> 01:28:22,130
government objective.
And there are many,

1538
01:28:22,131 --> 01:28:26,480
many legal steps along the way here.
It's complicated.

1539
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:31,780
There are lots of steps and it is the 
Supreme Court of Canada that does this.

1540
01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:32,983
It is the Supreme Court of Canada that 
defines and ultimately decides how we 

1541
01:28:37,041 --> 01:28:39,860
balance those rights.
Thank you.

1542
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:41,823
Um,
so another question for Professor 

1543
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:46,370
Peterson.
Um,

1544
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:47,523
why do you feel that someone's personal 
gender identity and pronouns infringes 

1545
01:28:50,981 --> 01:28:51,814
your free speech?
Can one not also argue based on your 

1546
01:28:54,521 --> 01:28:59,170
interpretation that professors can use 
racial slurs in their classroom?

1547
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:00,330
Um,
and the,

1548
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:02,160
that the inability to do

1549
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,710
so would violate their freedom of 
speech?

1550
01:29:05,180 --> 01:29:06,960
Well,
that's pretty much the same question.

1551
01:29:06,961 --> 01:29:08,570
I think.
Um,

1552
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:16,113
I think that we're crossing a dangerous 
line and the line is the requirement 

1553
01:29:20,441 --> 01:29:21,274
that's being put upon people by 
government agencies with the full force 

1554
01:29:24,611 --> 01:29:29,611
of the law behind them to decide what 
language categories you're going to use.

1555
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:30,993
Now,
I think that's a form of compelled 

1556
01:29:32,681 --> 01:29:34,900
speech,
which has a technical meaning.

1557
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:36,123
I know in the United States the American
Supreme Court ruled against the 

1558
01:29:39,701 --> 01:29:40,361
government's,
right?

1559
01:29:40,361 --> 01:29:41,194
Do you use compelled speech in 1943 I 
understand that this isn't the United 

1560
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:46,090
States,
but we share a common law background and

1561
01:29:46,450 --> 01:29:48,820
the doctrines are relevant.
Um,

1562
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,320
for me,
you see,

1563
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:53,290
when I opened this debate,
this forum,

1564
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:54,413
um,
I tried to explain what this is about 

1565
01:29:56,111 --> 01:29:58,000
and I couldn't explain everything and 
that it's about,

1566
01:29:58,001 --> 01:30:01,600
because it's about too many things.
But one of the things,

1567
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:02,463
it's about his etiology and the 
distinction between the left and the 

1568
01:30:06,551 --> 01:30:07,384
right.
And let's say now I truly believe that 

1569
01:30:11,171 --> 01:30:12,004
these made up pronouns of which there 
are many dozens in fact and there's no 

1570
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:17,494
consensus on them and that doesn't even 
begin to start a discussion about the 

1571
01:30:21,641 --> 01:30:23,560
use of the other kin pronouns.

1572
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:24,393
And you can look those up if you want.
Because if you can define your identity 

1573
01:30:27,401 --> 01:30:28,234
subjectively any way you want,
then there's absolutely no reason that 

1574
01:30:30,161 --> 01:30:33,220
you can't claim a non human identity.
And you may not know.

1575
01:30:33,221 --> 01:30:34,054
But in the lgbt a rainbow coalition,
there is q plus and the q plus people 

1576
01:30:38,891 --> 01:30:39,724
include the other kids who claim a non 
human identity and they're arguing in 

1577
01:30:42,641 --> 01:30:45,610
that rainbow coalition that they have 
the same right to their,

1578
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:46,733
um,
to their pronouns that everyone else 

1579
01:30:48,221 --> 01:30:49,054
does.
And their pronouns includes such things 

1580
01:30:50,351 --> 01:30:54,340
as work worms self.
You're not supposed to interrupt.

1581
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:56,073
Actually,
I was just going to ask if you could go 

1582
01:30:57,161 --> 01:31:00,470
back to the point about the analogy 
between,

1583
01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:02,660
uh,
the racial slur and the end.

1584
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:04,360
I don't think there's any analogy at 
all.

1585
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:08,500
But the thing about difference between,
I'm talking about compelled speech,

1586
01:31:08,710 --> 01:31:09,543
there's a difference between saying that
there's something you can't say and 

1587
01:31:12,461 --> 01:31:15,190
saying that there are things that you 
have to say.

1588
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:16,293
And I regard these made up pronouns,
all of them as the neologisms of a 

1589
01:31:21,191 --> 01:31:25,420
radical pc authoritarians.
Do you understand that?

1590
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:28,510
And I don't,
I'm not a fan of that sort of person.

1591
01:31:28,690 --> 01:31:29,523
And the reason I'm not a fan of that 
sort of person is because I've done my 

1592
01:31:32,351 --> 01:31:33,184
homework,
I've read everything I can get my hands 

1593
01:31:35,081 --> 01:31:35,914
on in the development of authoritarian 
political systems and I know the 

1594
01:31:38,561 --> 01:31:39,394
literature inside out and backwards.
And I am not going to be a mouthpiece 

1595
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:47,160
for language that ID test.

1596
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:52,860
And that's [inaudible].

1597
01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:04,590
So we have one question left and I'm 
going to what end?

1598
01:32:04,591 --> 01:32:08,100
It's for professor Bryson.
Professor Bryson.

1599
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:09,013
Um,
I noticed that you were on the vice 

1600
01:32:11,191 --> 01:32:16,191
presidential task force at UBC for a two
spirited trans and other folks.

1601
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:17,933
And I wonder,
this is obviously been a difficult 

1602
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:25,700
debate for the University of Toronto,
but from your perspective as someone who

1603
01:32:26,101 --> 01:32:26,934
salt.
So had a senior leadership role as well 

1604
01:32:28,891 --> 01:32:29,724
as being an expert in the area.
Do you have any thoughts or guidance 

1605
01:32:32,551 --> 01:32:33,384
about what universities can do to ensure
that we're moving things forward in a 

1606
01:32:38,641 --> 01:32:40,110
helpful,
inclusive boy?

1607
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:42,240
Let's talk about

1608
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:47,090
[inaudible].
So this week we heard from uh,

1609
01:32:47,091 --> 01:32:47,924
Justin Trudeau's government about the 
apology that would meet be made to Lgbq 

1610
01:32:53,690 --> 01:32:55,610
Canadians concerning,
uh,

1611
01:32:55,640 --> 01:33:00,640
the extraordinarily violent impacts of 
discriminatory activities that were also

1612
01:33:02,241 --> 01:33:04,730
research activities happening,
uh,

1613
01:33:04,731 --> 01:33:09,731
at Canadian universities and elsewhere 
to locate and to fire lgb Canadians from

1614
01:33:11,361 --> 01:33:12,194
the public service and from the rcmp.
And let's pay attention to some of the 

1615
01:33:16,701 --> 01:33:17,534
details of that situation.
You can google the fruit machine and an 

1616
01:33:21,841 --> 01:33:25,190
incredibly bogus apparatus that was 
created,

1617
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:26,293
let's say not coincidentally by a 
psychologist at Carleton University Dr 

1618
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:31,753
Wake,
who was the chair of the psychology 

1619
01:33:32,871 --> 01:33:37,100
department intended only to identify,
uh,

1620
01:33:37,170 --> 01:33:38,003
supposedly homosexuals who then would be
fired from government service and from 

1621
01:33:42,591 --> 01:33:43,424
the rcmp.
Those actions were carried out by means 

1622
01:33:47,481 --> 01:33:48,314
in part of entirely bogus research 
claims supported and funded by a 

1623
01:33:53,661 --> 01:33:56,930
Canadian public university,
Carleton University.

1624
01:33:58,010 --> 01:34:02,900
If we fast forward to the fairly recent 
past,

1625
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:08,080
we could look at chem h making an 
apology for the incredibly damaging work

1626
01:34:08,211 --> 01:34:09,044
carried out by Zucker in his focus 
conversion therapy based entirely on 

1627
01:34:15,651 --> 01:34:19,250
these ideas about sex producing gender 
constancy,

1628
01:34:19,550 --> 01:34:20,383
which then in the case of gender diverse
young people could be cured by means of 

1629
01:34:24,621 --> 01:34:26,000
conversion therapy.

1630
01:34:26,270 --> 01:34:27,103
Cam H had to apologize to the Canadian 
public and to Ontarians for the harms 

1631
01:34:32,121 --> 01:34:32,954
carried out by Dr Zucker.
And so I think that we might need to 

1632
01:34:36,471 --> 01:34:39,320
think about two things at the University
of Toronto.

1633
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:42,990
And one would be an apology for any,
uh,

1634
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:43,993
damages to the right to safety and the 
right to humanity on the part of Trans 

1635
01:34:48,891 --> 01:34:49,724
and gender diverse people at the 
university and in the great city of 

1636
01:34:52,821 --> 01:34:55,460
Toronto more generally.
And then of course,

1637
01:34:55,461 --> 01:34:59,210
the University of Toronto.
And perhaps it already is.

1638
01:34:59,211 --> 01:35:01,340
And I'm sure you know more about this 
than I do,

1639
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:02,563
could implement the kind of wide ranging
program to think very carefully about 

1640
01:35:07,341 --> 01:35:08,174
how in an intelligent way to accommodate
gender diversity and Trans people in 

1641
01:35:12,711 --> 01:35:13,544
this wonderful,
great Canadian University that is the 

1642
01:35:17,330 --> 01:35:18,440
University of Toronto.
Thank you.

1643
01:35:22,810 --> 01:35:24,260
We are,
we are at the

1644
01:35:24,410 --> 01:35:26,300
end of our time.
Um,

1645
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:28,940
I would like to thank all the 
participants,

1646
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:31,070
the organizers,
the many,

1647
01:35:31,071 --> 01:35:31,904
many,
many staff who did a great job making 

1648
01:35:34,910 --> 01:35:37,130
this forum happen.
And of course,

1649
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:39,590
uh,
the members of the audience who came out

1650
01:35:39,591 --> 01:35:42,320
today,
I don't so like to acknowledge,

1651
01:35:42,321 --> 01:35:44,570
and I think professor Bryson mentioned 
this,

1652
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:45,673
that tomorrow,
November 20th is transgender day of 

1653
01:35:48,711 --> 01:35:52,830
remembrance and that observes the fact 
that many,

1654
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:53,703
uh,
who many members of the transgender 

1655
01:35:55,071 --> 01:35:56,270
community,
uh,

1656
01:35:56,420 --> 01:36:00,170
either lost their lives or were injured 
in acts of violence.

1657
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:04,220
And on a moment like this,
it's worth remembering that the reason,

1658
01:36:04,221 --> 01:36:05,054
the legislation we're debating today and
we're discussing today came into 

1659
01:36:08,421 --> 01:36:09,254
existence,
was to protect those communities from 

1660
01:36:11,931 --> 01:36:13,760
those acts of violence.
The five,

1661
01:36:13,761 --> 01:36:14,594
19 at five 19 church street has a number
of activities and the U of t sexual and 

1662
01:36:20,511 --> 01:36:23,660
gender diversity office also does.
Um,

1663
01:36:23,690 --> 01:36:24,710
it's a,
it's,

1664
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:28,970
I wasn't sure what to expect today,
I have to say coming in as moderator.

1665
01:36:29,570 --> 01:36:30,350
But,
uh,

1666
01:36:30,350 --> 01:36:35,350
I just want to thank everyone once again
for the discussion and hope as we said,

1667
01:36:35,751 --> 01:36:39,950
that some illumination has happened,
which is after all of what we seek to do

1668
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:41,900
in the university.
Thank you.

1669
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:45,270
[inaudible].
