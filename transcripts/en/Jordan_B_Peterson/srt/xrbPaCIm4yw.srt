1
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,583
One of the things that people are very 
much confused by in the modern world is 

2
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:54,903
what our tech people meant by Gods.
And that's because whatever the day 

3
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,313
these were that had the motive force,
that archaic people attributed to the 

4
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,830
Gods seem to have disappeared in modern 
culture.

5
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,993
Now the young end hypothesis is that's 
because they turned into psychological 

6
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:12,970
traits fundamentally or motivational 
forces.

7
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:16,660
So what the,
what archaic societies would describe as

8
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:17,494
Gods,
we would describe as motivational 

9
00:01:18,431 --> 00:01:20,320
forces.
So for example,

10
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,810
Venus is a goddess,
the goddess of love,

11
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:27,811
and we would associate her power with 
love and sex fundamentally.

12
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,373
And the reason that that's an reasonable
association from the archaic standpoint 

13
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:34,773
is because the mode of quality that 
makes up what Venus represents is 

14
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:40,084
transpersonal,
which means it's not limited to one 

15
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:43,024
person and it's immortal in that the 
motive force that characterizes sexual 

16
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:49,324
affiliation exists,
whether or not a single individual 

17
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:52,174
exists.

18
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:57,010
So it's transpersonal has the force of a
personality because if you fall in love,

19
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:01,690
you're motivated by a certain set of 
standards and perspectives,

20
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:03,550
right?
If you're gripped by beauty,

21
00:02:03,551 --> 00:02:04,384
say or if you're gripped by lust that 
imposes a particular view of the world 

22
00:02:09,551 --> 00:02:12,820
on you and impels your action sometimes 
despite your will.

23
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,420
And so that would be equivalent from the
archaic perspective to possession.

24
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,703
And it's clearly the case that archaic 
societies who were engaged in warfare 

25
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:24,400
for example,
would conduct rituals to ensure that the

26
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:25,234
warriors that made up their societies 
were in fact possessed by the correct 

27
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:29,740
God.
So might be Mars,

28
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:31,270
for example,
the Roman God of war,

29
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,283
so that on the battlefield they 
exhibited the proper characteristics of 

30
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,700
somebody who was in a battle,
right.

31
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,710
Rage.
You can think rage,

32
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,143
sole possession by the god of war would 
be equivalent to this possession by a 

33
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:43,870
state of rage.

34
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,700
No,
it's not quite that simple.

35
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,560
It isn't the only that archaic people 
externalized motive forces and gave them

36
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:53,680
the status of Daddy's.
What they did was more complex than not.

37
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:56,380
And I think you can understand that a 
little bit better if you start to,

38
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,890
if you start to give some thought to the
modern behavioral notion of the stimulus

39
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,393
and the stimulus is a very,
very weird concept because the behavior 

40
00:03:06,631 --> 00:03:07,464
is who weren't interested in taking 
apart what was inside the brain would 

41
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,730
attribute motive force to the stimulus,
right?

42
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:14,860
They'd say if you present an animal with
the stimulus,

43
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:15,843
he will therefore act.
And that meant that the behaviors were 

44
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:19,354
making the presupposition that the 
motive power resided in some manner in 

45
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:24,610
the stimulus.
Well,

46
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,260
why,
why would they think like that?

47
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:27,094
Well,
it's an archaic mode of thought in a 

48
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:30,700
sense.
You could imagine a child saying,

49
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,553
um,
one of my friends today made me really 

50
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:34,960
angry.

51
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,793
Right?
Which means that the child is 

52
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:37,264
essentially conflating his or her own 
internal emotional state with the 

53
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,360
proximal stimulus that gave rise to that
state.

54
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:44,194
And you see complex associations like 
that taking place with regards to the 

55
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:48,910
apprehension of beauty.
Say,

56
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:49,744
because beauty is a very,
very complex and difficult to localize 

57
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,880
phenomena.
If you're very attracted to someone,

58
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,790
are you attracted by them?
Well,

59
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,624
in a sense,
of course you are because they are the 

60
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:01,270
are.
But in another sense you're not at all.

61
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:02,104
Because what's happening is that you're 
engaged as much in the attraction as 

62
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:09,250
anything that's motivating you from the 
outside world.

63
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:12,460
And I think that partly accounts for 
your sense of foolishness,

64
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,294
especially if the person that you're 
attracted to doesn't return your 

65
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:16,720
attraction.
I mean,

66
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,000
you know that from your perceptual 
perspective,

67
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:24,490
you're attracted and dominated by the 
object.

68
00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:25,324
But by the same token,
you know entirely that easy as it is to 

69
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:32,770
presume it's them and their faults say 
pretty much it all has to do with you.

70
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,873
So in the modern world where we've been 
able to separate out the object and the 

71
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:41,890
motive force of the object,
the daddies have sort of moved inside of

72
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:42,724
us and becomes psychological forces.
But you can understand if you think 

73
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,084
about it in this manner that things 
weren't so clear prior to the dawn of 

74
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:49,660
the empirical age.

75
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,973
That gives you a little bit of 
background with regards to what the 

76
00:04:58,501 --> 00:04:59,334
notion of Daddy meant to archaic 
societies who still utilize those 

77
00:05:03,331 --> 00:05:07,650
notions as explore explanatory terms.
Okay.

78
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:10,890
So we know that if you're caught up in 
one of these little,

79
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,610
uh,
world games that you may be motivated by

80
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:16,290
something very,
very fundamental,

81
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,660
right?
A tendency that transcends you,

82
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:19,494
the tendency to propagate yourself,
say Freud's fundamental motivational 

83
00:05:23,161 --> 00:05:27,450
level sexual affiliation or the tendency
to maintain yourself.

84
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,680
Those you could say are the fundamental 
gods of existence,

85
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:34,950
the fundamental driving force has,
and it's there.

86
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,640
It's the interaction of those two forces
over great periods of time that produced

87
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:42,360
the great diversity of life and human 
life that we see before us.

88
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:46,560
And each of those fundamental,
most fundamental of gods have their

89
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,460
differentiated many.
And so to speak.

90
00:05:50,461 --> 00:05:54,420
So that well engaged in the met had a 
goal of self preservation.

91
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,440
You Act out plots of hunger and plots of
thirst,

92
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,274
and he moved from cold to hot or from 
heart to call depending on your 

93
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:03,690
particular,
uh,

94
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,233
on your particular,
on the particular temperature of your 

95
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:10,610
surroundings or with regards to self 
propagation.

96
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,623
You're attracted to people who are 
repelled by them for reasons that are 

97
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:16,520
frequently absolutely beyond your 
comprehension,

98
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:18,560
by the way.
So I just found out this week,

99
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,650
and this is absolutely staggering.
I think that if you,

100
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,783
uh,
if you run an experiment on a group of 

101
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:25,304
women and you track their menstrual 
cycle and then you give them t shirts 

102
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:29,444
that men have worn to smell,
that women who are operating like the 

103
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:36,110
smell of symmetrical men better than 
asymmetrical men.

104
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,333
So,
and that's partly because symmetrical 

105
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:39,194
men are probably more healthy,
but this is a good example of how the 

106
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:47,570
motive forces that configure your world 
are dependent on instinctual forces that

107
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:48,404
are not only beyond your consciousness,
but they're beyond even at the moment 

108
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:54,530
any of our explicit explanations.

109
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,401
So,
uh,

110
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:00,234
another finding that's very similar that
I came across recently turns out that 

111
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,773
mice will not mate with mice that has rh
blood factors that are likely to 

112
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:11,180
produce,
um,

113
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,690
unfit offspring.
Uh,

114
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,800
the more closely genetically related the
RH factors,

115
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,600
the more likely there is to be a,
uh,

116
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,400
uh,
a catastrophe with regards to offspring.

117
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,830
And the mice seem to detect the rh 
factor by smell.

118
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:26,664
So recently this was run by with women.
And it is also the case that women 

119
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:30,644
prefer man who's rh factors are at an 
optimal distance from them in terms of 

120
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:34,274
smell.
So this is some example of how these 

121
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:36,854
unbelievably archaic systems,
cause like the olfactory systems are 

122
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:40,184
unbelievably archaic,
produce alterations in Worldview at a 

123
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:49,010
level that's massively below 
consciousness.

124
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,533
So underneath your cortical shell,
which is tonically inhibiting all your 

125
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,474
emotional and motivational systems,
lies all these motivational and 

126
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,374
emotional systems and they have branches
that grow up into the cortex and they 

127
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:08,090
have the capacity to control your 
behavior completely involuntary.

128
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,100
So for example,
if you're gripped by fear,

129
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:11,510
if you're gripped by fear,
it's very,

130
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:13,490
very difficult to overcome that 
voluntarily.

131
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,650
And at least initially you won't be able
to,

132
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,780
which is to say that when the chips are 
down,

133
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,010
the underlying motivation,
when emotional systems have control.

134
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,383
Okay,
so then what happens from that 

135
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:25,514
perspective?
Then what happens when you encounter 

136
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:29,770
something you don't understand?
And I think the best way to explain it,

137
00:08:29,771 --> 00:08:32,600
it's something like generalized 
disinhibition,

138
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,463
which is that all your underlying 
motivational and emotional systems are 

139
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:39,440
more or less disinhibited 
simultaneously.

140
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,303
And the reason for that is because you 
want to be maximally prepared to do 

141
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:43,484
whatever the hell is necessary to do 
when you're somewhere that you don't 

142
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:49,190
understand and because you don't know 
what that thing is going to be,

143
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,113
all your systems go on.
And when psychologists talk about 

144
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:55,040
stress,
which is an abysmal word,

145
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,500
it means everything and nothing.
When psychologists talk about stress,

146
00:08:58,501 --> 00:09:02,720
what they mean is generalized 
disinhibition of emotion and motivation.

147
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,740
Then you come to the case of ancient 
Egypt.

148
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,450
What are the things Lee Outta points 
out,

149
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:14,210
which I think is really interesting.
I mean really phenomenal.

150
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,420
The story I'm going to tell you right 
now was essentially revealed in Egyptian

151
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:20,384
culture at the dawn of the culture 
rather than developing over the course 

152
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:24,434
of the culture.
So the Egyptians had a revelation right 

153
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,853
immediately that the most fundamental of
gods was the one who created as a 

154
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:35,780
consequence of his tongue and his speech
very much akin to the

155
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,443
Sumerian idea.
With regards to Marta can also till 

156
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,220
later Judeo Christian ideas.
So here's the story.

157
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,320
There's four players in this tram.
Okay.

158
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,230
There's Ocirus,
his wife,

159
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,213
Isis.

160
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,330
Yeah,

161
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,000
horace,
their son and Seth.

162
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,440
And Seth is,
Oh,

163
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:57,750
Sarah says evil brother.
Okay.

164
00:09:57,751 --> 00:09:58,300
Now,
oh,

165
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,300
cirrus was a remarkable guy.
He was the founder of the Egyptian state

166
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:04,884
from the mythological perspective.
So kind of like Romulus and Remus for 

167
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,750
Rome,
a myth or like George Washington for the

168
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,583
u s right.
A mythologized figure who represented 

169
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,590
all of the Pharaohs and people for that 
matter,

170
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:18,450
who'd actually constructed the Egyptian 
state.

171
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,670
Oh,
cirrus farther of Egypt,

172
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:21,540
so to speak.
But it was,

173
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,170
Sarah's is Kinda old and little archaic 
and maybe a little bit see now,

174
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,840
and even possibly a little bit naive in 
that,

175
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,973
you know,
even no matter how great you were in 

176
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:31,800
your youth,
as time goes on,

177
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:32,634
you lose contact with environmental 
transformations and the old rules that 

178
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:39,210
you live by or not necessarily 
applicable to the present.

179
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,840
And some of those things that you ignore
become paramount of importance,

180
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,930
importance.
And it turns out that ocirus has an evil

181
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:46,764
brother Seth.
And Seth eventually turns into Satan as 

182
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:51,060
mythology develops through the 
centuries.

183
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,550
And Seth is a nasty guy,
right?

184
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:54,384
I mean,

185
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,380
okay.

186
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,213
What he wants more than anything is 
undeserved dominion over the Egyptian 

187
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:01,560
state.
No,

188
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,820
Sarah's because he's not paying 
attention.

189
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:08,280
And because he isn't sufficiently 
cognizant any more of the power of evil,

190
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,383
more or less,
ignores his evil brother who in turn 

191
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,413
chop some into pieces and then 
distributes his pieces all over the 

192
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:22,050
Egyptian state.
Now you might say,

193
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,480
well,
why didn't he just kill up?

194
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,471
Right?
I mean,

195
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:26,730
you'd think chopping them up would kill 
him,

196
00:11:26,731 --> 00:11:28,560
but he's a god and you can't just kill 
them.

197
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,550
The reason in mythology,
and you'll see this in movies as well,

198
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:33,384
where the villain never quite die,
so the hero never quite dies is because 

199
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,103
even if you eliminate individual 
embodiments of what those figures 

200
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:40,614
represent,
new embodiments manifest themselves 

201
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:43,104
virtually immediately.
So one of the things mythology is quite 

202
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:47,550
clear about is that you never win a 
final battle with evil.

203
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,700
It's a,
it's a prominent property of the world.

204
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,380
So anyways,
seth hacks up.

205
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,440
Sarah's spreads them all over the land.
Uh Oh,

206
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:02,274
Sarah sends up living a kind of shadowy,
a nebulous ghostlike existence down in 

207
00:12:06,231 --> 00:12:09,500
the underworld and seth becomes the 
ruler of the state.

208
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,750
A nasty story.
All right,

209
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:13,241
bud.
Oh,

210
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:17,150
cirrus has isis as a wife now isis had a
huge cult.

211
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,613
She was a powerful goddess.
Goddess of the underworld are kind of 

212
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,460
combination of Kelly and Diana,
so to speak,

213
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,080
capable of tremendous destructive power,
but also the source of all good things.

214
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,943
Something very much like tire map.
Now Isis got wind of her husband's 

215
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,080
disintegration,
so to speak,

216
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,093
and she went searching around Egypt till
she found his fellas and with that she 

217
00:12:44,211 --> 00:12:46,640
makes herself pregnant.
Okay,

218
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,760
so what does that mean exactly?
It means something like this.

219
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:56,290
The collapse of any great order
brings with it new potential.

220
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,363
And I think this is something that 
capitalism has way over forms of 

221
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:03,380
government like communism.

222
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,353
Capitalism has mechanisms in place to 
allow large structures that are no 

223
00:13:09,681 --> 00:13:12,260
longer needing their function to 
collapse,

224
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,333
but frequently when they collapse,
it's not like they disintegrate into 

225
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,161
dust,
right?

226
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:19,940
They disintegrate into sub components,
so to speak,

227
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,983
many of which then come to terms with 
the fact that the order has collapsed 

228
00:13:25,401 --> 00:13:26,234
and build something new.
So you can't get rid of culture so 

229
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:30,230
easily.
You can hack it up into bits.

230
00:13:30,231 --> 00:13:31,790
You could disembody it,
so to speak.

231
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,180
You can spread it all over the state.
You could introduce chaos into it,

232
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,223
but that's,
that's something that has the potential 

233
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:42,560
of new birth,
like the Phoenix rising from the ashes.

234
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:43,730
So anyways,
Isis,

235
00:13:43,731 --> 00:13:46,610
who's the matrix,
who's tire Matt Gets,

236
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,930
Oh,
Sarah says fellas,

237
00:13:47,931 --> 00:13:51,950
which is the container of the germ of,
of culture,

238
00:13:51,951 --> 00:13:52,970
right?
That the,

239
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,863
the phenomena that's capable of the 
seminal idea and she makes herself 

240
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,124
pregnant and she gives birth to horace,
who's the long lost son of the rightful 

241
00:14:02,781 --> 00:14:03,380
king,
right?

242
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,560
A very typical mythological motif.
Okay,

243
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:07,394
so porous is alienated from the kingdom,
which is another very common 

244
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:12,950
mythological motif.
You know,

245
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:16,160
like how King Arthur for example,
is raised by commoners.

246
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,650
This same story pops up in,
in,

247
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,330
uh,
in the story of Christ,

248
00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:22,670
for example,
because Christ has heavenly parents.

249
00:14:22,671 --> 00:14:23,504
But then he also has his kind of 
ordinary parents and it's a very common 

250
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:27,331
motif.
Anyway,

251
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:28,164
so horace grows out outside of the 
classical structure of the Egyptian 

252
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:34,454
state,
which is tilted terribly towards evil 

253
00:14:36,921 --> 00:14:39,380
because seth is dominated because it was
serious,

254
00:14:39,381 --> 00:14:40,214
was too blind to his evil brother to 
take appropriate defensive actions and 

255
00:14:43,521 --> 00:14:44,354
he grows to maturity.
And then he decides like all rightful 

256
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,900
sons of the long lost king to reclaim 
his heritage.

257
00:14:50,901 --> 00:14:52,400
So he goes back to Egypt,
right?

258
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,290
And he has this vicious battle with seth
and in the process,

259
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,360
SEF tares out one of his eyes.

260
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:00,763
Well,
fine.

261
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,880
And that's an indication of just exactly
how devastating a battle with the forces

262
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:05,930
of evil,
so to speak,

263
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:06,764
precisely are they represent a critical 
threat to the integrity of 

264
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:11,690
consciousness.
Right?

265
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,760
That's why he loses an eye.
Well,

266
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:14,594
luckily enough,
horace has got his act together and he 

267
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:20,960
does defeat seth and he banishes him and
it gets the eye back and then you think,

268
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:21,860
okay,
great.

269
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,760
Pop the eye back in,
become emperor,

270
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:26,594
everything's fine.
Now let's backtrack a little bit and 

271
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:30,260
think about this politically.
Now,

272
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:32,390
the Egyptians had this really weird 
idea.

273
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,583
They had the idea that the living 
pharaoh was the living pharaoh and the 

274
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:41,270
dead pharaoh at the same time.
That makes no sense rationally,

275
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:42,104
but it makes a lot of sense from a 
narrative perspective because what they 

276
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:46,490
were saying is something like this,
look,

277
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:50,000
you got to think that when you become 
king or when you become president,

278
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:50,834
or when you take on a role of that 
absolute magnitude that then you're 

279
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:55,214
partly you,
but you're also partly this role and 

280
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:58,250
there's really no way out of that.

281
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,083
Right?
And the role is composed of the 

282
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,790
unbelievable weight of the cultural 
tradition that you're representing.

283
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:05,624
And you can say,
well that's true for being king and for 

284
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:08,234
being president.
But it's also true if you become a 

285
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:12,350
doctor or a lawyer,
any sort of specialized occupation,

286
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,710
it's partly you cause you're embodying 
the role.

287
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,930
But it's partly the role too.
So the pharaohs,

288
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:18,764
the live Pharaoh and the dead feral 
because the dead feral represents 

289
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:22,400
culture,
right?

290
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,030
The king is dead long live the king.
Okay.

291
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,343
But paralleling that idea was the idea 
that the pharaoh was not only the dead 

292
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:32,360
Pharaoh and the live pharaoh at the same
time,

293
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,330
but that he was ocirus and horace at the
same time.

294
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,750
But then you think in this story horace 
has taken over,

295
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:41,750
Seth is God as I back,
he can be king,

296
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,853
but he isn't king yet.
And this is where the Egyptians really 

297
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:45,710
get their act together.

298
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,543
And,
and I think of the two stories that I'm 

299
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:49,814
telling you,
this is the one that has the most 

300
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,374
significance,
I think for modern people because we're 

301
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:56,480
so likely to sidestep our obligation to 
our culture,

302
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,640
whatever that happens to be.
So instead of popping this I back in his

303
00:17:01,641 --> 00:17:02,474
head,
which is the first thing you'd think he 

304
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:03,914
does,
he decides he's going to go back to the 

305
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:05,804
underworld where ocirus is living in 
this ghostlike and dead manners since 

306
00:17:09,651 --> 00:17:12,740
he's been chopped up by seth.
So he goes down into the underworld,

307
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,140
which is no piece of cake and he finds 
those serious,

308
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:18,320
they're in this kind of half dead state 
and it gives him his eye

309
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,810
and that enlightens ocirus.
Right?

310
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:24,644
It gives him vision.
And so then he takes so serious back to 

311
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,750
Egypt,
arm in arm,

312
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:30,584
so to speak.
And it's the conjunction of ocirus and 

313
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:36,260
Hori Horis that constitutes the basis 
for Egyptian sovereignty.

314
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,660
And that is bloody brilliant,
right?

315
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:41,240
Because the Egyptians figured out that,
so horace,

316
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:44,180
his tongue is Marduk for all intents and
purposes,

317
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:45,014
right?
He's this avenging hero in the Egyptian 

318
00:17:47,991 --> 00:17:48,824
story.
He fights political corruption rather 

319
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:51,684
than chaos.
But you can understand that those are 

320
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:55,120
two flip sides of the hero archetype.
They,

321
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,013
they are,
the hero archetype has two basic 

322
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,140
elements.
One is the confrontation of the terrible

323
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:05,010
aspect of nature.
Chaos in its most brutal form.

324
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,480
And the other is the confrontation with 
the archaic aspect of culture.

325
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:13,050
And in some ways those aren't 
distinguishable because if culture isn't

326
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,750
archaic,
chaos never makes itself present.

327
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,853
So which is to say you can't separate 
out political degradation from 

328
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:23,160
environmental degradation.
Say it's the same idea.

329
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,970
So anyways,
horace has this great idea.

330
00:18:30,971 --> 00:18:32,260
He needs his father,
right?

331
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:35,370
And I told you about the same motif 
emerging in Pinocchio.

332
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,180
We already locked at that,
right?

333
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:42,181
Pinocchio doesn't become genuine until 
he risks his life saving is farther.

334
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,143
All right?
So the same thing is happening in this 

335
00:18:44,141 --> 00:18:46,720
particular situation.
So that's pretty cool.

336
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:47,554
So then you get this situation where the
Egyptians characterize sovereignty as 

337
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:56,590
the capability to overcome evil in the 
political domain combined with,

338
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,690
and that's a youthful capability,
right?

339
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,690
Combined with the wisdom of the past.
All right?

340
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,553
Then you look at that from a political 
perspective and you find out already 

341
00:19:05,381 --> 00:19:06,214
that the Egyptians viewed the Pharaoh as
the live pharaoh and the dead pharaoh 

342
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:10,834
simultaneously.
But then you find out something else 

343
00:19:12,221 --> 00:19:13,054
that's interesting and it gives you some
really real insight into just exactly 

344
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:17,650
how bloody powerful these ideas were.

345
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,753
So you think,
what did the Egyptians do with their 

346
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:22,300
spare time?
And then you think,

347
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:23,770
well,
they built the pyramids,

348
00:19:23,771 --> 00:19:24,341
right?
I mean,

349
00:19:24,341 --> 00:19:27,160
and that was no trivial undertaking.
It was sort of the,

350
00:19:27,161 --> 00:19:31,600
uh,
5,000 BC equivalent of flying to Mars.

351
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,940
And I mean,
the pyramids are pretty impressive now,

352
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:34,774
but they were a hell of a lot more 
impressive in their original form 

353
00:19:36,671 --> 00:19:39,550
because they were in the middle of an 
immense complex.

354
00:19:39,551 --> 00:19:43,930
And the pyramids were dedicated to the 
immortality of the Pharaoh.

355
00:19:43,931 --> 00:19:47,350
And the Pharaoh was possessed by a 
spirit called car.

356
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,110
And car was his,
his immortal spirit.

357
00:19:50,111 --> 00:19:52,420
And it was the union of Horace and 
ocirus.

358
00:19:52,421 --> 00:19:53,254
Okay.
So Egyptian society was dedicated to a 

359
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:01,240
day of flying the immortal spirit of the
Pharaoh,

360
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,790
the Union of Horace and ocirus.
And,

361
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,970
uh,
it was this union that gave the f,

362
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:11,010
it was this identification with this 
union that gave the Pharaoh a phenomena.

363
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:15,520
The Egyptians called Matt and not was 
like truth or good order.

364
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:18,310
And you can think about it as conscience
in a census,

365
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:23,460
if the Pharaoh was,
was utilizing the union of horizontals,

366
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:24,484
or I know serious than he would have an 
intuitive ability to decide what the 

367
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:32,650
appropriate course of order was.
And so the Egyptians would say,

368
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:34,510
for example,
when the Pharaoh came into the court,

369
00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:35,344
they'd say the sun has risen.
And by that they meant that the power 

370
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,660
that reigned over the dominion of the 
night had arrived.

371
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,213
They conceptualized Matt has the 
capacity to put order in the place of 

372
00:20:46,241 --> 00:20:47,620
chaos,
essentially,

373
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,500
formally.
So they assimilated the Union of Horace.

374
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:53,650
And ocirus with the capability of 
putting order in the face of chaos.

375
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:54,783
They regarded that as a mortal and they 
spent all of the excess resources of 

376
00:20:58,781 --> 00:20:59,614
their society glorifying that idea.
And you think you don't produce 

377
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:06,730
something like the pyramids without 
really being possessed by an idea,

378
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:07,000
right?

379
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,833
This is no trivial undertaking.
It's going over a period of several 

380
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,500
hundred if not several thousand years.
And it takes an awful lot of work.

381
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,483
So this idea of the mortality of the 
Union of Horace and Ocirus and its 

382
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:19,594
association with sovereignty was an 
absolutely potent idea for the 

383
00:21:22,511 --> 00:21:23,344
Egyptians.
It gave their whole culture motive 

384
00:21:24,641 --> 00:21:26,080
force.
Okay,

385
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:30,220
so the Egyptians thought Pharaohs and 
mortal and not the reason why,

386
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,210
and we more or less partake in his and 
mortality by being his subject.

387
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:35,044
So that was a pretty good deal.
But then Eliod of points out something 

388
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:38,344
very interesting,
and this is called the democratization 

389
00:21:40,061 --> 00:21:40,894
of ocirus.
And what you found was that initially 

390
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:43,923
there were certain symbolic 
representations representing the 

391
00:21:46,511 --> 00:21:49,690
immortality of the Pharaoh that could 
only be used by the Pharaoh.

392
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,810
But as Egyptian culture continued to 
develop,

393
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,943
then the symbolic representations,
if a mortality started to be adopted by 

394
00:21:57,881 --> 00:22:00,250
the aristocracy,
and what did that mean?

395
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:01,923
It meant that this,
this process that the Egyptians had 

396
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,563
conceptualized as integral to the order 
of the state was no longer solely 

397
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:15,130
embodied in the hands of the Pharaoh,
right?

398
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:19,420
It had started to drift down the power 
hierarchy into the aristocracy.

399
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:20,943
Okay,
well then you think what happens after 

400
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:24,100
that?
So by the end of Egyptian society,

401
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,280
the aristocrats were characterized by
an identity with the union of Horace and

402
00:22:30,571 --> 00:22:31,450
Ocirus,
right?

403
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:33,250
Sovereignty had started to spread 
itself.

404
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,113
Oh,
then you think what starts to happen 

405
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:36,310
with the greats,
right?

406
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:40,210
The Greeks attribute to sovereignty to 
every male,

407
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:42,400
Greek barbarians,
no women,

408
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:44,110
no,
but at least all males,

409
00:22:44,111 --> 00:22:44,944
right?
You get a beginning of a democratic 

410
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:47,950
notion there.
Um,

411
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,760
the Jews developing ideas that if not 
derived from Egypt,

412
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:59,800
where at least similar in structure to 
Egyptian ideas,

413
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:04,450
say not the aristocracy knock the 
pharaoh,

414
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,493
but every individual has the capacity of
establishing a direct relationship with 

415
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,640
the form of the Daddy,
right?

416
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,473
Then you have a Christian revolution 
that follows that where the idea that 

417
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,493
sovereignty and Harrison,
the individual is distributed to 

418
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,620
everyone,
right?

419
00:23:20,621 --> 00:23:21,610
Everyone,
male,

420
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:22,660
female,
criminal,

421
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:24,240
dawn,
criminal murderer,

422
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,680
rapist tax man,
you name it,

423
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,353
sovereignty and here is within them and 
it's on that soil that our whole 

424
00:23:30,731 --> 00:23:31,564
democratic culture emerges.
These unbelievably archaic ideas first 

425
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:39,820
acted out right first embodied in ritual
first dramatized,

426
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,893
then only told his stories,
developing more and more coherence over 

427
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,630
over stretches of time of thousands of 
years,

428
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:51,820
not hundreds of years,
but thousands of years becoming more,

429
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,990
more coherent,
becoming more pointed,

430
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,810
becoming more relevant with regards to 
their embodiment.

431
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,673
Then starting to become understood 
explicitly and distributed through the 

432
00:24:00,111 --> 00:24:00,944
entire society
and it's on that ground that our world 

433
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,463
rests not on the ground of rationality 
as established in say Europe in 1500 

434
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:19,340
what we have is much more profound and 
solid and deep.

435
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:22,370
Then any mirror,
rational construction,

436
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,713
it's,
it's a form of government and the 

437
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:27,620
calibrated state so to speak.

438
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,750
That's a consequence of an emergent,
if not evolutionary,

439
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:33,584
at least social evolutionary process.
And I would say that it stems much 

440
00:24:37,821 --> 00:24:41,240
farther back than that because you can 
imagine something like this,

441
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:45,920
look,
if this ideal personality that should be

442
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:46,754
sovereign is represented by the optimal 
combination of creativity and 

443
00:24:49,851 --> 00:24:50,684
traditionalism,
say if that's the optimal combination 

444
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,220
and if we're prepared to regard that as 
optimal,

445
00:24:58,221 --> 00:24:59,054
if,
if that's what you perceive when you 

446
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:03,470
perceive someone that you respect and 
admire her,

447
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,873
then you could say that success in our 
social hierarchies is predicated on the 

448
00:25:08,991 --> 00:25:12,020
degree to which you actually embody that
combination.

449
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:12,854
And then you see an interaction between 
individual success and this social 

450
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:19,274
construction.
That would be an interaction that 

451
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:21,374
extends over the centuries or even 
thousands of century so that as these 

452
00:25:24,141 --> 00:25:25,880
ideas become more and more developed,

453
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,363
we become more and more adapted to 
embodying them as a consequence of 

454
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:35,000
evolutionary pressure.
So it's not just cultural,

455
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:39,650
it's also biological.
So our political presuppositions rest on

456
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:43,040
a cultural basis,
which is unbelievably archaic,

457
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,160
resting in turn on something even lower 
than that.

458
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:46,994
And I think examples of that or are 
those that I've provided you with 

459
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:51,170
already.
We know for example,

460
00:25:51,171 --> 00:25:54,360
that chimps who have to live in a 
dominance hierarchy,

461
00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:56,150
a very aggressive,
especially the males,

462
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,163
but they're also very cooperative,
so the males who are aggressive spend a 

463
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:00,404
substantial amount of time repairing 
social boundaries in the aftermath of a 

464
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:05,743
aggressive incident because they're just
as concerned with keeping the bloody 

465
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:11,750
hierarchy intact as they are in climbing
it.

466
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:12,584
They have to be.

467
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:14,090
Yeah,

468
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:18,580
and we know that even wolves won't kill 
a subordinate wolf once they've defeated

469
00:26:18,581 --> 00:26:19,414
it,
they allow the subordinate wolf to 

470
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:21,980
maintain its own existence.
Right?

471
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:22,814
They have this notion,
this procedural notion that even those 

472
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:31,991
entities that appear insignificant may 
in some manner that's beyond speech,

473
00:26:32,901 --> 00:26:35,300
still contribute to the integrity of the
whole,

474
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,343
and that's an idea that's very much 
similar to our notion that sovereignty 

475
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:39,740
in Harrison,
the individual,

476
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:41,600
right.
We've taken further.

477
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:44,370
No matter what you do,
even if you're in clear violation of the

478
00:26:44,371 --> 00:26:45,204
law,
your rights remain in tact because no 

479
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:50,160
matter how outcast you are and how 
apparently beyond redemption,

480
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,640
your existence may still contribute 
something to the integrity of the hall.

481
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,330
And as far as I'm concerned,
that doesn't appear to be a metaphorical

482
00:26:57,331 --> 00:26:59,340
idea.
If you dismiss it,

483
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:00,803
you cannot dismiss it without 
simultaneously dismissing the ground on 

484
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:06,450
which our state's rest.
And so then you have to ask yourself,

485
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,080
are you willing to do that?
And if the answer is no,

486
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:13,770
well then you have to start doing,
you have to start to question what it is

487
00:27:13,771 --> 00:27:14,604
that you actually believe.
Because if you buy the doctrine of 

488
00:27:16,921 --> 00:27:18,300
natural rights,
which you do,

489
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:21,930
you act it out,
then all of this follows in its wake,

490
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:26,220
or it rests on sand and it bloody well 
better not rest on sound.

491
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,073
Okay?

492
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,113
Yeah.
