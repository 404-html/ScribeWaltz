1
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,163
So on to Sigmund Freud,
we're going to give him somewhat short 

2
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:14,944
shrift,
I'm afraid because we only have an hour 

3
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:17,980
to talk about Freud,
but that's okay.

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,440
We could get a fair way through it.
Um,

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,953
he's still persona non grata,
I would say among experimental 

6
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:28,300
psychologists and probably clinical 
psychologists as well.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,640
But that seems to me to be very unfair.
Um,

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,780
Freud,
Freud is one of those thinkers who,

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,840
uh,
all that's left are his mistakes.

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,573
And the reason for that is that 
everything that he discovered or put 

11
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:43,234
forward,
it's so entrenched in our culture now 

12
00:00:44,921 --> 00:00:45,754
that we think it's self evident.
And so everything correct has been 

13
00:00:49,331 --> 00:00:50,164
assimilated and that just leaves 
everything that's more or less floating 

14
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:55,030
on top to look wrong.
And,

15
00:00:55,031 --> 00:00:55,864
but Freud is also one of those thinkers 
who was always wrong in an interesting 

16
00:00:58,361 --> 00:01:01,240
way and that's very useful.
And so,

17
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,583
um,
I also think that many of the things 

18
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:07,090
that he put his finger on,
that our abs of steel disputed,

19
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:09,910
for example,
the idea of the oedipus complex are much

20
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:13,720
more useful than people are willing to 
admit,

21
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,670
especially in the clinical realm.

22
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,580
Because the oedipal complex,
which we'll talk about quite a bit,

23
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,390
is actually a,
uh,

24
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,573
a description of a fairly stable form of
familial psychopathology where child 

25
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:34,360
gets trapped within the confines of a 
family because the relationship with one

26
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:39,220
parent or the other or both is so tight 
that they can't break beyond it.

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,140
And maybe because of their own inability
to move towards independence,

28
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:47,290
but more frequently because of,
uh,

29
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,183
what you might describe as a kind of 
conspiracy between the sun and the 

30
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:51,994
parent or the child and the parent that 
prevents them from moving towards 

31
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,880
autonomous life and keeps them in a 
state of,

32
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,030
essentially a state of childhood 
dependence.

33
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,373
Freud said,
I started my professional activity as a 

34
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:09,804
neurologist trying to bring the relief 
to my neurotic patients under the 

35
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:13,284
influence of an older friend.
And by my own efforts I discovered some 

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,750
important new facts about the 
unconscious and psychic life,

37
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,080
the role of instinctual urges and so on.
Out of these findings grew a new science

38
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:26,180
psychoanalysis,
a part of psychology,

39
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,313
and a new treatment for the neuroses.
I had to pay heavily for this bit of 

40
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:31,244
good luck.
People did not believe in my facts and 

41
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:37,670
thought my theories unsavory.
Resistance was strong and unrelenting.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,833
In the end,
I succeeded in inquiring pupils and 

43
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:42,890
building it up in new international 
psychoanalytic association,

44
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,993
but the struggle is not over.
He made that recording just shortly 

45
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,370
before he died.
He moved to La,

46
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,660
to England to escape the Nazis.

47
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,280
Before Freud,
I guess

48
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,600
the mind was,
it's complicated because Freud of course

49
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:05,260
was not the only person to be thinking 
along the lines that he thought.

50
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,303
Pierre Jenay,
who was one of his teachers had 

51
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:08,884
originated and started to develop.
Many of the ideas that I would say were 

52
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:13,150
popularized by Freud,
but

53
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,550
the idea of the unconscious mind was not
certainly not as well developed prior to

54
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:25,120
Freud as it became afterwards.
And

55
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,300
before that.
I suppose

56
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,373
you might say that in so far as people 
thought of the mind at all they thought 

57
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:36,094
of in philosophical terms and the mind 
would be that part of you that's that 

58
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:43,330
you're aware of like in the dark and the
Cartesian sense.

59
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,193
Descartes said,
I think therefore I am and it kind of 

60
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:46,864
seems in some sense self evident that 
you're aware of and have control over 

61
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,683
the contents of your own mind.
But that was what Freud really 

62
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:57,790
questioned and he questioned it,
deeply said,

63
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:58,624
well first of all the idea that you're 
one thing like one mind is a dubious 

64
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,870
idea to begin with because people are 
full of internal contradictions and then

65
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,440
the idea that your mind is all of one 
type,

66
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,743
it's,
it's all of one form was also very 

67
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,004
questionable as far as Freud was 
concerned because you could be 

68
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:22,210
fractionated into subcomponents and you 
know the idea for example,

69
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:23,044
that your anger or your sexual desire 
could be an autonomous part of your 

70
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:29,830
personality in some sense that it could 
overtake you and control you.

71
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,843
That's really afraid and idea.
And one of the classic Freud and ideas 

72
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,074
really is that people are made out of 
sub personalities and those sub 

73
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:39,714
personalities are alive.
And that's one of the things I really 

74
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:42,934
like about the psychoanalytic thinkers 
because even the psychologist who say 

75
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:52,441
over the last 30 years or thereabouts 
since maybe longer now anyways,

76
00:04:52,861 --> 00:04:55,720
since the demise of behaviorism as an 
ideology

77
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,910
and the admission by psychologists that 
there were,

78
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,040
there is an act of unconscious or many 
active unconscious,

79
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,490
which is a better way of thinking about 
it.

80
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,170
Psychologists still really haven't come 
to terms with the idea in any deep sense

81
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:15,100
that these unconscious processes are 
living things.

82
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,023
You know there when when psychologists 
talk for example about the cognitive 

83
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:20,044
unconscious,
they're talking about something that 

84
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,993
they describe it more machine like with 
more machine like metaphors and that's 

85
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,870
not reasonable.
You,

86
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,723
you understand things a lot better if 
you understand that the sub components 

87
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,543
that make up people,
the fragmentary bits of them and also 

88
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:36,724
the biological subsystems that that are 
part and parcel of your being are much 

89
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,890
more intelligently viewed as 
personalities there.

90
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,170
They're kind of unit dimensional 
personalities in some sense.

91
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:48,730
So that for example,
if you're angry,

92
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:49,564
you're nothing but angry,
I mean that's an overstatement 

93
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,683
obviously.
Or if you're afraid you're nothing but 

94
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:56,230
afraid or if you're hungry,
you're nothing but hunger.

95
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,603
While certainly true.
If you get hungry enough or thirsty or 

96
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:00,970
too hot or any of those things,
you,

97
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,570
you kind of collapsed to a simpler 
personality that only has one motivation

98
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:06,404
in mind,
and we'll talk a lot as we progress 

99
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,313
about the grounding of those unit 
dimensional motivational systems in 

100
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:16,010
biology.
But I'd have to say that Freud was among

101
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:16,844
the first red least the first to 
synthesize a coherent theory of this 

102
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:22,154
multiplicity and to put it forth while 
also insisting that much of what was 

103
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:28,394
happening to you and inside of you was 
not immediately accessible to your 

104
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:37,610
awareness.
And it's a very profound,

105
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,350
it's very profound discovery.

106
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,280
It means among any among many other 
things that you can formulate ideas.

107
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,533
First of all,
it means that you can act out things 

108
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,000
that you don't understand for reasons 
that you don't understand.

109
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:59,110
It also means that your memory can 
contain things that's represented in one

110
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:00,164
way,
but that can't be understood it in 

111
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:02,420
another.
So for example,

112
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,780
and we know this is true because there 
are independent memory systems,

113
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:08,270
there's an independent memory system for
procedures.

114
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,403
That's for actions.
There's an independence memory system 

115
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:14,720
for what you might describe as 
imagination for,

116
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,110
for the memory that uses images.
And then there's uh,

117
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,900
another system that articulates 
knowledge.

118
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,763
That's the semantic memory system.
And it's not obvious at all that the 

119
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:29,120
contents of all of those are equivalent.
And that's why,

120
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:29,954
for example,
you can dream things that you don't 

121
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:32,774
know.
Cause one of the things you might think 

122
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:34,754
is that your dreams watch you act and 
they watch other people act and then 

123
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:40,010
they make a little drama out of that.

124
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,220
And that drama has information in it.
But you don't necessarily know what that

125
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:46,610
information is in that.
You can't describe it consciously.

126
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:47,661
Right.
It's,

127
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:48,494
it's akin to the Ph.
Eddie an idea that kids can play a game 

128
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,430
and you can take them away from the game
and then they won't know how to describe

129
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:57,080
the rules even though they could play 
the game.

130
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:57,914
And so dreams can contain information 
that's full of the encoding of behavior 

131
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,780
that has information in it that you're 
not consciously aware of.

132
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:09,440
And so then you can become consciously 
aware of that in kind of a revelation.

133
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:11,570
Sayed,
maybe that's what you do when you become

134
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:12,404
aware of the meaning of a dream or the 
meaning of a fantasy or something like 

135
00:08:14,781 --> 00:08:18,830
that.
And that's all our ability to think that

136
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,100
way in some ways can be traced back to 
Freud.

137
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,050
Now,
Freud concentrated mostly I would say at

138
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:32,051
least in terms of pathology on sexual 
and aggressive impulses and I,

139
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:33,694
I don't think that there's any mystery 
for modern people about why aggressive 

140
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:38,414
impulses might be particularly difficult
to integrate into the personality and 

141
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:45,530
might remain underdeveloped or we'll say
repressed,

142
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,030
although those aren't the same thing.

143
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,063
And I think in order to,
you might think that in different times 

144
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:52,004
in society,
some things are allowed to surface and 

145
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:57,890
express themselves.
And other things are less allowed.

146
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,900
And so Victorian Times had a number of 
characteristics that made the repression

147
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:04,074
of sexuality particularly likely,
and perhaps also the repression of 

148
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:07,554
aggression.
And we're talking about Victorian times 

149
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,940
and in Europe obviously,
and only one time in one place

150
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,960
as Henry or Ellenberger,
Jay says,

151
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,280
this is a great book,
by the way,

152
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:19,860
the discovery of the unconscious.
If you're interested in,

153
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,740
if you're really interested in 
psychoanalytic ideas,

154
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:23,790
Freud,
young and Adler,

155
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:24,624
and also the history of those ideas,
there's no better book than the 

156
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:29,760
discovery of the unconscious.
It's an absolutely remarkable book,

157
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,930
a great work of scholarship.
I think it,

158
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,760
it goes for about 250 pages before it 
even gets to Freud.

159
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:39,270
And so it places Freud's discoveries in 
their historical context.

160
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,220
So that's a really good thing to know.
Allan Burke.

161
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:42,054
Jay says it was a world shaped by man 
format in which women occupied the 

162
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:46,044
second place.
Political Rights for women did not 

163
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:48,444
exist.
The separation and dissimilarity of the 

164
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:54,000
sexist was sharper than today.
Women who wore slacks,

165
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,190
their hair shorter smoke,
we're hardly to be found.

166
00:09:56,191 --> 00:09:58,770
And the university's admitted no female 
students.

167
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,633
Man's authority over his children and 
his wife was unquestioned education was 

168
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:03,834
authoritarian.
The desk product father was a common 

169
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:09,900
figure and was particularly conspicuous 
only when he became extremely cruel.

170
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,510
Laws were more repressive,
delinquent youth,

171
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:16,260
sternly punished and corporal punishment
was considered indispensable.

172
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,520
Now,
so the times themselves,

173
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:22,500
I would say were harsher and more 
repressive,

174
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:25,050
but then there was an element to 
sexuality that was also

175
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,680
extraordinarily problematic.
I mean,

176
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,070
the first thing you might notice might 
consider,

177
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,203
and people generally don't,
it's almost impossible to overstate how 

178
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,740
revolutionary the birth control pill 
actually is.

179
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,323
You know,
people like to think that the political 

180
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:45,654
rights that women have attained have 
been a consequence of a political 

181
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:49,350
struggle,
but I don't buy that for a second.

182
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:51,000
I don't think that's true even in the 
least.

183
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:54,870
I think that what happened was that we 
underwent a biological revolution in the

184
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:55,704
1950s late 1950s with the emergence of 
the birth control pill and that for the 

185
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:00,954
first time in human history gave women 
pretty reliable control over their 

186
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:05,154
reproductive function.
Not really transformed them into 

187
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:09,540
entirely different biological beings.
In many,

188
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,820
many ways.
Like here's an example,

189
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,410
a subtle example.
So you know,

190
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,083
if you track women through their 
oscillation cycle and you show them a 

191
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:21,990
picture of a man,
same mat and you do nothing but vary his

192
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:22,824
jaw width when there are relating the 
guy with the wider jaws more attractive 

193
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:29,430
and when they're not ovulating,
the farthest away from that,

194
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,413
the guy with the thinner jaws more 
attractive and that's associated with 

195
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:33,540
testosterone levels.

196
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,870
And so women who are fertile like more 
masculine men.

197
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,913
And basically if you're on the pill,
then you're never in that operation 

198
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:42,870
phase.
And so one thing that may have happened,

199
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:44,340
and I don't know this for sure,
but it's,

200
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,880
it's interesting to consider,
is that since women have been taking the

201
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:48,714
birth control pill,
their preference for less masculine men 

202
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:51,294
has become more pronounced.
And that could easily be of the things 

203
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:54,454
that's fueling at least some of the 
tension that's existed and exists now 

204
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:01,930
politically between men and women.
But the point is is that you just cannot

205
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,700
ignore the massive consequences of a 
biological revolution like that.

206
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:07,534
And to make any other factor causal.
When you're trying to understand the 

207
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:15,010
political movement movements,
especially in the last say 40 years,

208
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:16,810
it's you're putting the cart before the 
horse.

209
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,943
Now it's reasonable to point out that 
the pill wouldn't have been accepted as 

210
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:26,671
a technology if certain political 
changes with regards to the emancipation

211
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:29,500
of women hadn't already been in place,
right?

212
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,543
No one would have even been allowed to 
do something like investigate 

213
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:33,544
contraception.
So you can't separate the biological 

214
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:38,110
from the political entirely,
but it's still,

215
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,440
it's still very useful to organize your 
organizing,

216
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:42,274
your thinking,
to realize just how profound a 

217
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,340
revolution that was.
But now back in the Victorian Times,

218
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:50,020
see there's another thing about 
sexuality.

219
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,093
Modern people like to think that there's
nothing dangerous about sex and that is 

220
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:54,394
like the stupidest thing you could 
possibly ever hypothesize because 

221
00:12:57,101 --> 00:13:00,250
everything about it is dangerous.
It's dangerous emotionally,

222
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,413
it's dangerous.
Socially it's dangerous because of the 

223
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,743
possibility of unwanted pregnancy.
And it's dangerous because of the 

224
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:10,060
possibility of sickness.
And that's a major one.

225
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:10,894
I mean,
so when aids emerged in the 1980s that 

226
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:13,834
could have easily killed all of us.
Now the fact that it didn't was 

227
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,013
wonderful,
but it did kill hundreds of millions of 

228
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:20,380
people.
So it was no joke.

229
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,213
It was a big deal.
And AIDS mutated to take advantage of 

230
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:25,504
promiscuity.
And so the relationship between sexual 

231
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:29,584
behavior in the transmission of disease 
is actually mediated at the biological 

232
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:33,640
level.
But anyways,

233
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:35,920
back in the 1890s they had the same 
problem,

234
00:13:35,921 --> 00:13:36,754
right?
They had the problem with syphilis and 

235
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,400
syphilis is one nasty disease.
It's,

236
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,523
it can mimic almost any other disease 
and it's devastating to your nervous 

237
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:46,690
system and you can pass it on to your 
children.

238
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,853
And so part of the reason that sexuality
was heavily repressed in the Victorian 

239
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:55,120
period was not only because of the 
possibility of unwanted pregnancy,

240
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:57,610
the relative poverty of people,
you know,

241
00:13:57,611 --> 00:13:59,860
back in 1895 in,
in Europe,

242
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,590
the average person lived on less than a 
dollar a day.

243
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,160
In modern terms,
you know,

244
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,870
it's almost impossible to understand how
poor people were.

245
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,704
And so sex in a poverty stricken place 
is also a lot more dangerous than it is 

246
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:13,540
in a rich place.

247
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,373
Because especially if you were given the
lack of employment opportunities for 

248
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:20,074
women back in the Victorian period,
if you happen to get pregnant out of 

249
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:25,210
wedlock,
you were and you are in serious trouble.

250
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,290
And so the fact that sexuality was 
repressed is hardly,

251
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,303
it's hardly a surprise because it was so
difficult to integrate into the full 

252
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,900
fledged personality,
you know,

253
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:39,280
and it as it as it still is.
So sexual repression,

254
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,563
supposedly characteristic feature of the
Victorian period was often merely the 

255
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:44,104
expression of two facts,
the lack of diffusion of contraceptives 

256
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,540
and the fear of venereal disease.
It was all the more dangerous because of

257
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,374
the great spread of prostitution and 
because prostitutes were almost 

258
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:55,730
invariably contaminated and therefore 
potential sources of infection.

259
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,043
We can hardly imagine today how monster 
selfoss syphilis appeared to people of 

260
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:02,810
that time.
While we can imagine a little bit better

261
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:04,910
than they could in 1970 because it 
hasn't,

262
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,350
you know,
AIDS is still with us,

263
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:10,520
although it's nowhere near the plague 
that it was say 25 years ago.

264
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,570
Well,
here's the floridian world,

265
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,940
Freud.
So let's,

266
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:17,774
let's take a look at the history of,
or the idea of the unconscious to begin 

267
00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:20,864
with.
And one of the things that you might 

268
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,803
want to consider conceptually is that 
there are many different forms of 

269
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:27,500
unconscious.
There's not just one.

270
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,663
And so Alan Borchez points out that by 
1,904 functions of the unconscious had 

271
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:35,300
been described,
there's a conservative function.

272
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,580
So the unconscious stores memories often
unaccessible to voluntary recall.

273
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,350
Well that's a strange one.
You know,

274
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:43,184
obviously you remember your past,
but you don't remember all of what you 

275
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:50,120
can remember at any given time.
And you don't really have access to that

276
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:52,580
full store of memories,
although you can try to remember.

277
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:53,414
So the unconscious is the,
you could imagine the memories are 

278
00:15:57,231 --> 00:16:00,920
represented somehow neurologically,
but neuro,

279
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,530
the neurological structure isn't exactly
the mind.

280
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,620
Like the neurological structure isn't 
exactly your consciousness.

281
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,810
There's some relationship between them 
that we don't know.

282
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,153
And the unconscious from a conceptual 
perspective is the place that your 

283
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:17,870
memories are that you sometimes can get 
access to and sometimes can't.

284
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,213
And so you might think,
well that there are the memories that 

285
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:22,664
you can't get access to.
There might be a variety of reasons you 

286
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:25,424
can't get access to them.
One might be that you've just forgotten 

287
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,113
and one might be that they're so painful
that you don't want to bring them to 

288
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:32,564
mind.
You'll you'll engage in tricks to stop 

289
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:35,234
yourself from getting access to them and
or maybe they're memories that are so 

290
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:43,130
complex that and painful that even if 
you did get access to them,

291
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,140
you wouldn't exactly know what to do 
with them.

292
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,470
And so there's not a lot of reason for 
you to bring them to mind because all it

293
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:51,710
is is pain without any,
without any utility.

294
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,900
And when you understand that a little 
bit,

295
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:56,720
you understand more about what Freud 
meant by repression.

296
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:58,363
The think about Freud is that he kind of
believed that like many people believe 

297
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,570
now that when you remember an event in 
the past,

298
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:06,404
it's,
it's almost as if you're using a video 

299
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:08,184
tape recorder and that when you 
experience that the memory is somehow 

300
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:12,404
recorded in you like it happened.
But that's not a very accurate version 

301
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:18,980
of how memory works.
I mean,

302
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,980
we know that memories can be easily 
distorted.

303
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,250
For example,
if you interview some one about an event

304
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,533
and you make suggestions that there was 
something present in the event that 

305
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:32,030
wasn't there,
and then you bring them back a couple of

306
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,500
weeks later and you ask them about the 
same event,

307
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:37,190
they'll often incorporate the thing that
they were told into the event.

308
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,563
And so,
and the idea that you can make an 

309
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:40,664
objective record of something that's 
happening to you is kind of a strange 

310
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,920
notion anyways because,
so for example,

311
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:46,754
if you're having an argument with 
someone and later you're asked what the 

312
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:53,580
argument was about and the other person 
is asked what the argument is about,

313
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,780
there's no necessary reason why the 
accounts will jibe at all.

314
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,630
Because a lot of time when you're having
an argument with someone,

315
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,880
you're arguing about what the argument 
is about,

316
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:03,990
right?
You say,

317
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:05,070
well,
you're angry at me.

318
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,000
Well,
why?

319
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,250
This is why I think you're angry at me.
And you say,

320
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:09,084
no,
this is why I think this event has 

321
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:12,690
occurred.
And you're thinking about,

322
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,553
especially if we know each other well,
you're thinking about the 

323
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:16,434
contextualization of that event across 
our entire history and I'm doing the 

324
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:21,174
same thing and I'm going to highlight 
things that you're not going to 

325
00:18:22,741 --> 00:18:23,574
highlight and I'm going to draw causal 
inferences that you're not going to 

326
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:26,364
draw.
And for us just to get on the same page 

327
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:30,000
about the memory's going to be very 
difficult.

328
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,223
So the idea that in especially with 
complex interactions with people that 

329
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:35,094
you can somehow make a video recording 
of the memory and actually capture what 

330
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:40,620
happens is,
is very,

331
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,440
very,
it's,

332
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,283
it's not true.

333
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,153
You,
you can't,

334
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,070
I mean you might be able to extract out 
certain objective facts,

335
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:47,904
but,
but generally if it's a dialogical 

336
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,110
issue,
if it's a relationship issue,

337
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,213
it spans such a long period of time that
just cutting a slice of it out doesn't 

338
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,540
constitute a reasonable record of a,
of what it means.

339
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,790
And that's what you're more concerned 
with too.

340
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,800
Like when,
when you have an experience,

341
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,933
you're not under so much concerned about
what happened from an objective 

342
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:08,904
perspective,
you're more concerned about what the 

343
00:19:11,221 --> 00:19:13,440
experience means.
And then you might ask,

344
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:15,900
well,
what does it mean to mean something?

345
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,003
And that was the question I was trying 
to answer in that paper I had you read 

346
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:24,000
right at the beginning of the class.
But one of the things that meaning means

347
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:28,260
is that it has implication for the way 
you look at the world or the way you act

348
00:19:28,261 --> 00:19:28,740
in the world.

349
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,660
And so if I tell you something 
meaningful,

350
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,003
what that's going to mean is in the 
future you're going to act slightly 

351
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:35,304
differently or maybe radically 
differently depending on how meaning it 

352
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,363
meaningful it is.
But also that the way that you look at 

353
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:41,064
the world has shifted.
And the way that you look at the world 

354
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:46,470
is actually an unconscious.
It's actually an unconscious process.

355
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:47,304
I mean,
you don't know while you're looking at 

356
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:50,184
the world,
how it is or why it is that you're 

357
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,570
looking at the world in that way.
I mean because,

358
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,553
well first of all it would just be too 
complicated and second you wouldn't be 

359
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:01,290
able to concentrate on what was actually
going on.

360
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,900
So your attention,
for example,

361
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:04,734
is mediated by unconscious forces.
And you know that you know that 

362
00:20:07,921 --> 00:20:10,290
perfectly well.
And this is another 40 and observation.

363
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,550
You know,
if you're sitting down to study,

364
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,940
for example,
your conscious intent is to study,

365
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,320
but you know perfectly well that all 
sorts of distraction fantasies are going

366
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,154
to enter the theater of your imagination
nonstop and annoyingly and there isn't 

367
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:29,610
really a lot you can do about that 
except maybe wait it out,

368
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:30,803
you know,
so you'll be sitting there reading and 

369
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,050
your attention will flicker away.

370
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,330
You'll think about,
I dunno,

371
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,460
maybe you want to watch Jane the Virgin 
on Netflix or something like that.

372
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:39,294
Or maybe it's time to have a peanut 
butter sandwich or you should get the 

373
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,174
dust bunnies from an out from underneath
the bed or it's time to go outside and 

374
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:46,950
have a cigarette.
Or maybe it's time for a cup of,

375
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,243
or it's like all these subsystems in you
that would like something aren't very 

376
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:53,464
happy just to sit there while you read 
this thing that you're actually bored 

377
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:56,704
by.
And so they pop up and try to take 

378
00:20:58,271 --> 00:21:00,970
control of your perceptions in your 
actions nonstop.

379
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,961
Maybe you think,
well,

380
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:05,130
this is a stupid course anyways.
Why do I have to read this damn paper?

381
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,140
What am I doing in university?
And what's the point of life?

382
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,060
It's like you can really,
well,

383
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:13,770
you can really get going if you're 
trying to avoid doing your homework and,

384
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,520
and then you might think,
well,

385
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:17,680
what is it in you that's trying to 
avoid?

386
00:21:17,681 --> 00:21:22,150
Because after all,
you took the damn course and you've told

387
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:26,050
yourself to sit down.
Why don't you listen well,

388
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,090
because you're,
you're a mess.

389
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,740
And that's basically why you haven't got
control over yourself at all.

390
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,310
And no more than I have control over 
this laptop.

391
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,530
Okay.
So there's the memory function of,

392
00:21:40,531 --> 00:21:41,364
of,
of the unconscious and there's the 

393
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:45,910
distis dillutive function.
That's an interesting one.

394
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,030
The unconscious contains habits once 
voluntary,

395
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,043
now automatized and dissociated elements
of the personality which may lead at 

396
00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:56,170
parasitic existence.
That's an interesting one.

397
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,630
I would relate that more to procedural 
memory,

398
00:21:58,990 --> 00:21:59,823
you know?
So what you've done is practice certain 

399
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:02,830
habits,
whatever they might be,

400
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,370
let's call them bad habits.
And you'd like those things to get under

401
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:07,480
control,
but you can't.

402
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:09,130
So maybe when you're speaking,
for example,

403
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,050
you use like,
and you know,

404
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:13,810
and you say,
Om Malott and you've practiced that,

405
00:22:13,811 --> 00:22:16,180
so you're really good at it and you'd 
like to stop it,

406
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:17,014
but you don't get to because you've 
built that little machine right into 

407
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,160
your being,
right?

408
00:22:21,161 --> 00:22:24,910
It's neurologically wired and it's not 
under conscious control.

409
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:29,370
And anything you practice becomes that.
It becomes part of you.

410
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,203
And,
and that's another element of the 

411
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,230
unconscious,
a different part.

412
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,050
And then there's a creative part,
which is that,

413
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,831
well,
you know,

414
00:22:35,831 --> 00:22:38,410
you're sitting around and maybe you're 
trying to write something,

415
00:22:38,411 --> 00:22:42,520
or maybe you want to produce a piece of 
art or a piece of music,

416
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,623
or maybe you're just laying in bed 
dreaming and you have all these weird 

417
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:48,130
ideas.
And especially in dreams,

418
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:50,140
it's like what?
Where do those things come from?

419
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,303
And even more strange,
one of the things that's really weird 

420
00:22:55,031 --> 00:22:58,750
about dreams and almost impossibly weird
is that you're an observer in the dream.

421
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,970
It's like a dream is something that 
happens to you.

422
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,150
Well,
you're dreaming it theoretically.

423
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,880
So how is it that you can be an 
observer?

424
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,640
It's almost like you're watching a video
game or a movie,

425
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,340
but you're producing it that at least in
principle,

426
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,650
although the psychoanalyst would say,
well,

427
00:23:14,651 --> 00:23:15,550
no,
not exactly.

428
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,190
Your ego isn't producing it.
Your unconscious is producing.

429
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:20,380
It's a different thing.
It's a different thing.

430
00:23:20,381 --> 00:23:21,550
And of course young would say,
well,

431
00:23:21,551 --> 00:23:22,384
it's deeper than that.
The collective unconscious might be 

432
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:24,604
producing it.
It's in some sense it isn't you exactly 

433
00:23:27,521 --> 00:23:28,354
or it isn't the you that you think of 
when you think of you and that's the 

434
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:34,420
eagle from the Freudian perspective,
the you that you identify with,

435
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:37,450
that's the ego and outside of that is 
the unconscious,

436
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:40,660
the ID.
That's more of the place of impulses.

437
00:23:40,661 --> 00:23:41,494
And you could think about those as the 
biological subsystems that can derail 

438
00:23:44,201 --> 00:23:45,470
your thinking,
right?

439
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:46,304
And that govern things like hunger and 
sex and aggression and your basic 

440
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,233
instincts is another way of putting it.
And it's a reasonable way of thinking 

441
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:56,180
about it because these are subsystems 
that you share with with animals.

442
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:57,830
You share them.
Certainly with mammals,

443
00:23:57,831 --> 00:23:58,664
you share most of them with reptiles,
you share a lot of them with amphibians 

444
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:04,100
and even going all the way down to 
crustaceans.

445
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,280
There's commonality for example in the 
dominance hierarchy circuits.

446
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:09,560
And so these are very,
very old things.

447
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,890
And the idea that you're in control of 
them is,

448
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,240
well you're not exactly in control of 
them.

449
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,820
And I would say the less integrated you 
are,

450
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,493
the less you're in control of them and 
the more they're in control of you and 

451
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:26,630
that can get really out of hand.
You know,

452
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,010
you can be like with people who have 
obsessive compulsive disorder,

453
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,690
for example,
which which,

454
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,640
which is,
which seems to be,

455
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:38,300
I would say that dissoluted elements in 
some sense of the unconscious,

456
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:39,134
the way that it's portrayed here,
poor people with obsessive compulsive 

457
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:42,824
disorder,
they can spend half their time doing 

458
00:24:44,511 --> 00:24:47,840
things that they can't really control 
and they have very strong impulses to do

459
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:50,310
the,
and it's very hard on them to block them

460
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,850
and holiday,
they'll almost panic if those things are

461
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:53,240
blocked.

462
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,100
And then you have people with two Rett 
Syndrome,

463
00:24:55,101 --> 00:24:57,950
you know,
that they'll be doing all sorts of weird

464
00:24:57,951 --> 00:25:01,440
dances and spouting off obscenities and,
and,

465
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,453
and,
and imitating people without being able 

466
00:25:05,061 --> 00:25:05,894
to control a 10 and sometimes a little 
bit of antipsychotic medication can 

467
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:10,664
dampen that down.
But it's as if there are these 

468
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:12,434
autonomous semi spirits inside of them 
that grip control over their behavior 

469
00:25:16,311 --> 00:25:19,100
and make them do things.
And you know,

470
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:19,934
you find that to some degree in your own
life because maybe you've become very 

471
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:26,060
attracted to someone even maybe you 
don't want to be attracted to the person

472
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:27,740
and then you find yourself,
you know,

473
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,890
texting them when you know perfectly 
well that you should be going to bed and

474
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,761
you know,
you're,

475
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:34,640
you're in a grip of something and,
and you can't control it.

476
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:37,940
And that's all part of the unconscious 
and all part of what Freud was studying,

477
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,120
the dynamic unconscious.

478
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,953
It's alive and it's a compass that the 
mind is a composite of contradictory 

479
00:25:45,381 --> 00:25:49,430
drives.
Now the way Freud thought about this,

480
00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:51,830
basically,
who has that with the ID and the ego and

481
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:52,664
the superego.
So if you think about the Ed as the 

482
00:25:54,201 --> 00:25:57,620
place where these contradictory drives 
emerge.

483
00:25:57,621 --> 00:25:58,454
So it sort of nature within the ego is 
the thing that's sort of being pushed 

484
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:04,190
back and forth by those contradictory 
drives.

485
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:07,940
And the Superego is the thing that's on 
top saying you better behave yourself,

486
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:08,774
you better behave yourself.
And so it's a different model than the 

487
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:11,744
[inaudible] model because Piaget assumed
that what would happen is that as the 

488
00:26:16,581 --> 00:26:18,500
child,
and I liked the Piagetian model better,

489
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:21,320
I think,
I think in healthy development,

490
00:26:21,321 --> 00:26:24,530
the Piagetian model is correct,
but an unhealthy development.

491
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:28,490
I think the Freudian model is correct 
that instead of integrating,

492
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:29,324
say the aggressive and sexual drives for
the sake of argument into your 

493
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:33,740
personality,
as you develop,

494
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,950
what happens is the superego just 
represses them instead.

495
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:41,030
So they don't become a dynamic part of 
you integrated into your ego.

496
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,800
They're just repressed.
You just don't manifest them.

497
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,993
And so that's how you be a good person 
and you can be the victim of a very 

498
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:48,084
harsh superego.
And that often happens if you've had a 

499
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:53,970
particularly tyrannical parent,
one or both,

500
00:26:53,971 --> 00:26:54,804
or maybe a tyrannical grandparent or 
maybe your or your own inner tyrant and 

501
00:26:58,111 --> 00:26:58,944
you've picked up to radical voices 
through your whole life and aggregated 

502
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:04,800
them into this terrible judge that's 
always watching you.

503
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,873
That's criticizing everything you do and
restricting you badly and really badly 

504
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:11,700
and what you're allowed to not allowed 
to do.

505
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,870
You see that with anorexic women,
well Ben could be anorexic too,

506
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:17,280
but it's much,
much less rare.

507
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,220
They have super egos that are just,
or it's one way of thinking about it,

508
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,870
that's just,
they're just deadly.

509
00:27:21,871 --> 00:27:24,270
They just criticizing every bit of them.

510
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,373
Well,
right to the point they're really 

511
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:28,110
criticizing the out of existence,
right,

512
00:27:28,111 --> 00:27:28,944
is you have to be so perfect that the 
perfection is not aligned with the 

513
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:36,030
ability to live.
You don't get to eat,

514
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,120
you know,
and,

515
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,330
and people like that,
they look at their bodies,

516
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,790
they even look at their bodies 
incorrectly,

517
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:45,270
like anorexic,
seem to be unable to see their bodies as

518
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:47,940
a whole that can only see their bodies 
as parts.

519
00:27:47,941 --> 00:27:50,190
And when you start seeing your body as 
parts,

520
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:51,024
you're really in trouble because he 
can't get a sense of actually what it 

521
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,890
looks like and body perception is very,
very complicated.

522
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,073
Anyways,
Piaget thought about the ego as in some 

523
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,673
senses,
the game that's played by all these 

524
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,783
dynamic drives that shaped by the 
broader community and so that could all 

525
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:09,720
be integrated,
but Freud would say,

526
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,100
well look,
when that doesn't happen,

527
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:15,180
instead you're subject to the tyranny of
the superego and it just says you should

528
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:16,440
never be angry,
right?

529
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,080
You should never express yourself 
sexually because if you do,

530
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:19,914
there's something wrong with you.
You're a bad person and you're a bad 

531
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:27,261
person if you ever get aggressive or so,
and then people who are living like that

532
00:28:27,451 --> 00:28:29,280
under those circumstances,
you know,

533
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:30,390
they get,
they,

534
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,620
well,
they're,

535
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,680
they're repressed is the right way to 
think about it.

536
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,293
Now,
Freud was interested in the idea that 

537
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:43,830
mental disorders could be caused for two
reasons.

538
00:28:43,831 --> 00:28:44,664
One would be purely bodily,
like maybe a head injury or say in the 

539
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:48,504
case of schizophrenia,
which is a good example of manic 

540
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:50,964
depressive disorder,
we have reason to believe that there's 

541
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:57,240
something physiological going on,
even though by identifying that has been

542
00:28:57,241 --> 00:28:58,074
very difficult.
And it's probably because there isn't 

543
00:28:59,161 --> 00:28:59,994
one form of schizophrenia.
There's probably many pathways of brain 

544
00:29:03,601 --> 00:29:05,880
injury that lead to schizophrenia 
symptoms.

545
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:09,150
And there's likely not one form of manic
depressive disorder either.

546
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,600
If you think of the form is having a 
standard causal pathway,

547
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,673
we know that there are,
because we've done genetic studies on 

548
00:29:15,781 --> 00:29:16,614
people who have manic depressive 
disorder in their family and you can 

549
00:29:19,981 --> 00:29:20,814
identify genes within a family that 
seemed to be contributing to the 

550
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:23,904
disorder.
But the problem is is that those genes 

551
00:29:25,591 --> 00:29:26,424
don't seem to be.

552
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,850
So then you'll take another family group
with manic depressive disorder and it'll

553
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,250
be a different genetic combination that 
causes that.

554
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:37,020
So,
so part of the reason why it's difficult

555
00:29:37,021 --> 00:29:37,854
to associate the,
even the more biological mental 

556
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,200
disorders with,
with biology all the way down is because

557
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:47,620
they're so complex.
And then there are other forms of mental

558
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:51,310
disorder that don't seem to be 
structured at all structural at all.

559
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:52,870
They seem to have more to do with,
well,

560
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:54,820
let's call it the psyche,
right?

561
00:29:54,821 --> 00:29:55,654
And that it's more like the contents of 
your thought have a problem rather than 

562
00:29:58,661 --> 00:30:03,150
the structures underlying your thought.
And of course that distinction is,

563
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,140
is difficult to make an a fine grained 
way,

564
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:05,974
but you kind of get the point.
I mean just because there's an error in 

565
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:10,174
your thinking doesn't mind really mean 
that the underlying biology in some 

566
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:14,350
sense has been compromised.

567
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,810
It's complicated because if the air is 
bad enough,

568
00:30:16,811 --> 00:30:18,880
then it can compromise the underlying 
biology,

569
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:19,714
but whatever.
It's a conceptual distinction and part 

570
00:30:22,931 --> 00:30:23,764
of the conceptual distinction is,
is helpful if you're trying to think at 

571
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:27,874
least in part about how you might cure 
it because if you're thinking about a 

572
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:32,800
brain disease,
then that

573
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,320
implies a different course of treatment,
at least in principle than it does.

574
00:30:38,321 --> 00:30:39,154
If you're thinking about a psychological
disorder where you might think about 

575
00:30:42,191 --> 00:30:43,750
talking to someone,
for example,

576
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:44,584
in straightening out their thoughts or 
helping them learn to behave in a 

577
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:47,224
different way.
And it was really Freud who started to 

578
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,670
think that he was the first person to 
really pause it.

579
00:30:54,671 --> 00:30:57,130
And this is pretty interesting to 
directly pause it.

580
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:01,990
That dialogue or conversation or 
speaking could be curative.

581
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,380
And that's another thing that people 
don't like to give him credit for.

582
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,213
I mean,
there wouldn't be all of these helping 

583
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,760
industries,
social,

584
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:15,070
social work and psychology and 
biological psychiatry and so far is that

585
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:18,490
also involves communication and 
counseling and all of these things.

586
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,473
Now that would have existed in all 
likelihood if Freud wouldn't have made 

587
00:31:23,621 --> 00:31:28,621
the original hypothesis that there was 
something about communication that could

588
00:31:29,501 --> 00:31:33,640
be curative.
No Freud believed that

589
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,420
experiences that hadn't been now he 
thought about experiences has repressed,

590
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,420
and this goes back to the videotape idea
of memory.

591
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,583
So the idea would be that you have a 
record of everything that's happened to 

592
00:31:46,811 --> 00:31:47,644
you and the records actually accurate,
and then some of those things that 

593
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,420
happened to you.
We're very,

594
00:31:52,421 --> 00:31:56,200
very shocking to you are very hurtful or
very depressing or very threatening.

595
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:01,470
And so you've decided that you're,
those have become repressed.

596
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,573
You're not paying any attention to them.
Now he has a complex mechanism to 

597
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:06,910
account for that.

598
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:07,743
And I actually think this is a place 
where his theory went badly wrong 

599
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:11,134
because you don't have a videotape 
memory and it isn't obvious that the 

600
00:32:15,011 --> 00:32:15,844
memories that you have of traumatic 
events are fully fledged and causally 

601
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,070
appropriate,
but just not paid attention to.

602
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,203
It's more like they're murky and unclear
in and of themselves and they contain 

603
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:30,214
too much.
And I don't think that people so much 

604
00:32:31,751 --> 00:32:36,751
repress as they do refuse to attend to 
or are unable to attend to.

605
00:32:37,871 --> 00:32:38,704
So it's more like a passive avoidance 
than a passive avoidance of something 

606
00:32:41,661 --> 00:32:44,780
that needs to be explored and gone 
through rather than,

607
00:32:44,781 --> 00:32:49,070
it is something you know that you don't 
want to look at that you are part of,

608
00:32:49,071 --> 00:32:49,904
you has put away.
And I think that's a major weakness in 

609
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:55,910
his theory and has led to a lot of 
problems with the idea of repression per

610
00:32:55,911 --> 00:32:56,150
se.

611
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:56,983
But anyways,
that was his idea that terrible things 

612
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:03,980
have happened to you and you or some 
part of you doesn't want to,

613
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,350
to,
to know about,

614
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,870
to know about.
And so they live this,

615
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:12,770
those repressed experiences live in 
autonomous life of their own too.

616
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:17,840
And here's an example of a trivial 
example of how that might work.

617
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:23,030
Imagine that you're at work and your 
boss says something to you that disturbs

618
00:33:23,031 --> 00:33:25,190
you.
Maybe it makes you question whether your

619
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:27,380
job is stable and so you're kind of 
upset about that.

620
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:32,210
But it's a casual offhand comment and 
you go back to work and you just sort of

621
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:34,020
forget that that even happened.
You know,

622
00:33:34,021 --> 00:33:36,170
we baby cause you're attending to 
something else,

623
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,183
but then you go home and you're just 
crabby as as can possibly be and you go 

624
00:33:39,921 --> 00:33:42,770
home and one of the people there says 
something a little annoying and you snap

625
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:43,604
at them.

626
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,563
It's like,
well that's analogous to what Freud 

627
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:47,990
would call a complex,
right?

628
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:50,930
Is that this?
Cause you can imagine what's happened is

629
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:51,764
that the bosses words have brought up a 
whole little subpersonality predicated 

630
00:33:55,821 --> 00:33:59,840
on doubt up to the surface.
And who knows how deep that would be.

631
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:00,674
Well,
what happens if I lose my job and if I 

632
00:34:02,031 --> 00:34:02,721
lose my job?
Well,

633
00:34:02,721 --> 00:34:03,554
what sort of person am I exactly and 
what about all these other times that 

634
00:34:06,441 --> 00:34:07,274
I've failed?
And then maybe you remember the other 

635
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:10,770
times that you failed and what am I 
going to do in the future?

636
00:34:10,771 --> 00:34:11,604
And so it's this whole cluster of ideas 
that surrounds that doubt and that's 

637
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:16,730
been activated.
It's just a little part of you.

638
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,833
And then maybe you're not attending to 
that because you're busy doing some 

639
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,680
other work.
But when you go home,

640
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,290
something triggers it and it like it's 
already there.

641
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,390
It's already get way more upset than you
should.

642
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,430
And that's,
that's what a complex is,

643
00:34:28,431 --> 00:34:31,190
except in a much more complicated 
manner.

644
00:34:31,191 --> 00:34:32,024
Like a complex might be a whole series 
of experiences that you've had that are 

645
00:34:37,281 --> 00:34:41,330
united by some emotion,
like threat that are,

646
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,780
haven't been transformed into a coherent
representation,

647
00:34:44,781 --> 00:34:47,240
but that can rise out of the unconscious
and possess you.

648
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,343
If you guys,
many of you guys have been a depressed 

649
00:34:51,111 --> 00:34:53,600
at at least one point in your life.
You know,

650
00:34:53,601 --> 00:34:56,750
it's actually very common for University
of Toronto Students,

651
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:02,270
especially in their first year.
It's about one in three if you,

652
00:35:02,271 --> 00:35:04,670
if you have students,
the Beck depression inventory,

653
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,713
but one in three Touro,
University of Toronto students in our 

654
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:11,300
research of have hit criteria for 
hospitalization.

655
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,300
I mean the back is a little 
oversensitive as far as I'm concerned,

656
00:35:14,301 --> 00:35:15,134
but,
but you know what it's like when you're 

657
00:35:15,801 --> 00:35:17,660
depressed,
it's like it's,

658
00:35:17,661 --> 00:35:18,494
it's,
it's a part of your personality sort of 

659
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:23,150
subsumes the whole and depression quite 
classically is,

660
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,253
well,
you can't think of anything good that 

661
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:25,754
happened to you in the past and you 
can't think of any reason why the 

662
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:31,220
present is good for anything and you're 
pretty damn hopeless about the future.

663
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,533
And so that's a complex as well.
And it's a complex that consists of 

664
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:36,134
nothing but negative emotion and it 
structures your memory and your 

665
00:35:39,331 --> 00:35:42,570
perception and your plans for the future
all at the same time.

666
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:43,883
Now,
Freud had a very lengthy list of ways 

667
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:53,520
that people could be treacherous towards
experiences they had that they wanted to

668
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:54,354
repress.
And so he called them defense 

669
00:35:55,711 --> 00:35:56,544
mechanisms.
This is how you fool yourself into 

670
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,053
believing that you don't have to take 
into account a certain set of negative 

671
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:05,190
experiences.
You know,

672
00:36:05,191 --> 00:36:06,840
it's like,
well,

673
00:36:06,841 --> 00:36:08,550
we'll go through the repression.
Okay,

674
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:09,384
well we talked about that denial well 
that often denial's a very complicated 

675
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:14,880
one.
Um,

676
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,040
okay.

677
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,630
See if I can come up with a good 
example.

678
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,210
Okay.

679
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,280
What is a classic example for people who
have,

680
00:36:25,281 --> 00:36:27,890
I think it's called Anosognosia,
I don't remember exactly.

681
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,993
It's neglect.
That's a less technical way of thinking 

682
00:36:30,951 --> 00:36:31,784
about,
so let's say you have a right parietal 

683
00:36:32,661 --> 00:36:36,200
damage from a stroke and you'll lose the
left side of your body,

684
00:36:36,201 --> 00:36:38,840
so you can't move it anymore.
But a worse,

685
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:39,703
you don't know what's there and you 
don't know that the left side of 

686
00:36:41,151 --> 00:36:44,150
anything is there anymore.
And God only knows how that happens.

687
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:46,760
But like you'll only eat half the food 
on your plate,

688
00:36:46,761 --> 00:36:47,594
only on the right hand side.
And if someone asked you to draw a 

689
00:36:49,551 --> 00:36:51,590
clock,
you'll cram all the numbers into the one

690
00:36:51,591 --> 00:36:52,424
side.
And so you kind of lose the idea of 

691
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:56,090
left.
And I think it's sort of like,

692
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:57,770
you know how when you're looking 
forward,

693
00:36:57,771 --> 00:37:00,440
there's nothing behind you.
You can't see anything back here.

694
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,800
It's not black.
It's not even God.

695
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:08,210
It's just simply not there at all.
And so if you could imagine that sort of

696
00:37:08,211 --> 00:37:12,470
stretching around halfway at seems to be
something what neglect is like,

697
00:37:12,471 --> 00:37:14,030
but anyways,
if you,

698
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,600
if you take someone with neglect 
according to Robert Shaundra,

699
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:19,250
and then if you irrigate their ear with 
cold water,

700
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:19,930
uh,
the,

701
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,920
the,
the year on the opposite side,

702
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:26,780
then they'll kind of have a little 
convulsion and then all of a sudden they

703
00:37:26,781 --> 00:37:29,510
become aware of their missing left hand 
side.

704
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,670
If you talk to them before you do the 
irrigation,

705
00:37:31,671 --> 00:37:32,504
you say,
well,

706
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,130
well,
what's up with your left arm?

707
00:37:34,131 --> 00:37:34,840
And they'll say,
well,

708
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,330
I,
I've,

709
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:38,120
my arthritis is bothering me and I don't
want to move it.

710
00:37:38,121 --> 00:37:42,200
They come up with some something that 
sounds akin to denial,

711
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,063
you know,
and then if you can snap them out of 

712
00:37:44,451 --> 00:37:45,284
that with that irrigation and they'll 
have a catastrophic emotional response 

713
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,470
logically enough to the loss of their 
entire left side.

714
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,813
And Rama Shondra and reports that 
lasting about 20 minutes and then 

715
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,500
they'll snap out of it and go right back
into the denial.

716
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:58,903
And sometimes people deny things because
they can't update what's happened to 

717
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:06,980
them is so overwhelming that they cannot
construct a new model.

718
00:38:06,981 --> 00:38:10,220
They just rely on the old one.
And you see this,

719
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,540
well imagine first that you've just had 
a tooth pulled and you know how many,

720
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:17,720
how long your tongue takes to remap the 
inside of your mouth.

721
00:38:17,721 --> 00:38:21,590
It's really hard to come up with a new 
concept of you if something catastrophic

722
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:24,710
happens.
And so sometimes the denial is just that

723
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,233
something,
the thing that has happened is so 

724
00:38:26,991 --> 00:38:29,030
overwhelming that the person can't model
it.

725
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,030
But then maybe also they refuse to think
about it.

726
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,620
And you see this emerging in lots of 
ways.

727
00:38:35,621 --> 00:38:39,400
So for example,
if people develop diabetes for example,

728
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:40,234
they're often not very good at taking 
their medication or regulating their 

729
00:38:42,371 --> 00:38:43,090
diet.

730
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:43,781
And you might say,
well,

731
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:46,000
they're denying the existence of their 
illness.

732
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:49,300
And to some degree they're probably 
doing that because who the hell wants to

733
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:51,970
think that they're diabetic?
But even worse than that,

734
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:54,250
it's like it's complicated to be 
diabetic.

735
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:56,440
You're no longer the same person that 
you were.

736
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,400
And so you have to learn a whole bunch 
of new ways to be this new person,

737
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:01,840
what to eat,
when to eat,

738
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,123
how to check your blood.
You have to be careful whenever you go 

739
00:39:04,871 --> 00:39:05,410
out.
Neat.

740
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,243
Like there's,
there's a hundred new things a day that 

741
00:39:08,591 --> 00:39:09,424
you have to learn.
And so separating denial from inability 

742
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:12,904
as a hard one,
but you can also understand that people 

743
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:16,690
might deny no,
that's just not happening.

744
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,940
That's,
that's,

745
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,130
I'm not going to admit to that reaction 
formation.

746
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,000
Oh,
that's one.

747
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,090
Maybe you hate your sister and maybe you
have your reasons,

748
00:39:25,091 --> 00:39:26,590
but you shouldn't hate your sister.

749
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:30,640
So what you do is act as if you really,
really liked her.

750
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:33,220
That's an overcompensation.
So that's another form of,

751
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,020
of defense mechanism displacement.
My boss yells at me,

752
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:40,210
I yell at my husband,
my husband yells at the baby,

753
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,373
the baby bites the cat.
While they're not really dealing with 

754
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:45,280
the problem,
which is the boss,

755
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:49,570
it's just pushed on down the road and 
identification.

756
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,753
You're bullied.
And instead of coming to terms with the 

757
00:39:52,871 --> 00:39:56,170
fact that bullying occurs,
you start bullying other people.

758
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,870
Uh,
rationalization.

759
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:01,600
Well,
you know what that means already.

760
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:03,730
You know,
maybe you don't do your homework,

761
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:04,683
you're procrastinating.
I bet you can come up with 15 

762
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:07,624
rationalizations,
no problem for why it's actually not 

763
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:14,290
necessary for you to do your homework 
right then intellectual ization.

764
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:16,630
Well Woody Allen's movies are about like
that.

765
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:19,180
He's got all these neurotic problems,
but he's smart.

766
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:23,410
And so he can come up with intelligent 
reasons why he's so messed up,

767
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,370
even though he knows he's messed up and 
it doesn't help sublimation.

768
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,773
Well that,
that was one of the things that Freud 

769
00:40:30,881 --> 00:40:32,920
thought characterized art.
So for example,

770
00:40:32,921 --> 00:40:33,754
there's a lot of erotic content in art.
And so if you're having trouble 

771
00:40:36,731 --> 00:40:37,564
establishing a relationship or if you 
want to have a relationship with many 

772
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:40,564
people,
then maybe what you do is sculpt nudes 

773
00:40:42,281 --> 00:40:44,620
or paint them.
And then there's projection,

774
00:40:44,621 --> 00:40:46,130
which is,
um,

775
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,223
I'm having an argument with you and I'm 
unwilling to admit to my mo my dark 

776
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:53,260
motivations and I'm very skeptical of 
you.

777
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:57,340
And so I assume that your characterized 
by all the dark motivations that I won't

778
00:40:57,341 --> 00:40:59,470
admit to in myself.
So

779
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,693
now Freud also believed that it was 
unconscious ideas that were at the core 

780
00:41:06,581 --> 00:41:07,414
of psychological conflicts and he 
described those conflicts as 

781
00:41:10,091 --> 00:41:13,480
incomprehensible distress,
psychosomatic symptoms.

782
00:41:13,481 --> 00:41:17,470
And so those would be the manifestation 
of psychological,

783
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:22,840
of the manifestation of psychological 
content in bodily form.

784
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,773
So that might be stress,
a stress related illness might be one 

785
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:26,524
way of thinking about that.
I've had clients who had hysterical 

786
00:41:29,381 --> 00:41:31,390
epilepsy,
so that was quite interesting.

787
00:41:31,391 --> 00:41:32,224
So that was a somatic of a psychological
problem back when Freud was practicing 

788
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,383
hysteria was much more common.
And maybe that was partly cause 

789
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:48,200
Victorian society was so centered on the
theater and so dramatic and people would

790
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:50,600
come in with like a paralyzed arm or 
something like that,

791
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,673
that he could sort out with hypnosis.
And so they were manifesting their 

792
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,143
psychological distress in bodily form,
often in a manner that was 

793
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:04,700
representative of that psychological 
conflict in some way.

794
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:08,600
Behavioral anomalies,
Hallucinations and delusions.

795
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:09,434
He thought that all of those could be 
manifestations of inner internal 

796
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:17,780
psychological conflict with their sets 
of unconscious ideas.

797
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:19,880
So,
you know,

798
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,550
let's go back to the,
to the boss example.

799
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,980
Your boss says something nasty to you.

800
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:25,853
Come home,
someone says something a bit provoking 

801
00:42:28,071 --> 00:42:28,904
and you fly off the handle and then you 
have an argument about what the hell is 

802
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,070
up with you because they say,
well look what I said was,

803
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,470
you know this big,
and you reacted like this.

804
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:37,520
And you're going to say,
well,

805
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:38,330
no,
no,

806
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:42,500
you're always annoying like that.
And which is kind of a denial thing.

807
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:45,050
And maybe the person doesn't let up and 
they say,

808
00:42:45,051 --> 00:42:45,411
no,
no,

809
00:42:45,411 --> 00:42:48,320
I really know that something's wrong.
And you do like six other things to keep

810
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:51,110
them the hell away from you.
And finally they're persistent enough.

811
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:53,090
So you break down crying and you say,
well,

812
00:42:53,091 --> 00:42:53,924
I had this terrible day at work and you 
didn't even really notice that you knew 

813
00:42:57,321 --> 00:43:00,500
that until the moment of the moment of 
the tiers.

814
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,350
And you see that very frequently in 
psychotherapy to,

815
00:43:03,351 --> 00:43:05,810
if you're talking to people,
for example,

816
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:07,630
maybe they're relating a story about 
their,

817
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:08,603
their marriage that collapsed badly and 
they're talking and all of a sudden 

818
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,720
they'll say something and they'll tear 
up and then they'll continue.

819
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,370
And you can grab that and you say,
look,

820
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,413
you just said something.
I noticed that your eyes filled with 

821
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:22,700
tears when you said that what was going 
through your mind.

822
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,700
Now often they'll,
they,

823
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,750
unless you catch it quick,
they'll forget.

824
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:31,220
So they're talking and they'll have,
and the talking about the past is,

825
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,530
you know,
flashing off images,

826
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:35,000
stick memories,
and you'll say,

827
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:36,680
well that made you cry.
And,

828
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:37,563
and they,
they often don't like that because for 

829
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:42,920
obvious reasons that something's come up
that they don't want to talk about.

830
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,480
And so you say,
well,

831
00:43:44,481 --> 00:43:45,314
what was flashing through your mind?
And the personal tell you like quite a 

832
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:48,434
lengthy little memory fantasy about a 
sequence of events that you know is 

833
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:53,663
still a hot button issue.
And that's another example of this 

834
00:43:57,441 --> 00:43:59,060
underlying complex,
you know,

835
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,193
and if you watch people,
you can watch people in normal 

836
00:44:02,241 --> 00:44:03,730
conversation,
this happens all the times.

837
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:08,390
Their eyes will move or they'll smile or
you can see as they're speaking that all

838
00:44:08,391 --> 00:44:10,580
sorts of different ideas are flooding 
through their head.

839
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:14,540
It's dreamlike in a sense too.
It's sort of as if the person is talking

840
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:18,950
and they're dreaming out the same time 
there's this image laden set of memories

841
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:21,860
that's going on at the same time.
And that can be quite broad,

842
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,740
far broader than they could encapsulate 
in the words.

843
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,160
And so you can catch that and if you're 
really listening to someone,

844
00:44:28,161 --> 00:44:28,994
really paying attention to them,
you can see when they're doubtful or 

845
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:33,690
when they pause for a long time.
That's another one.

846
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:34,973
You know that something's come up that,
that that's occupying their mind and 

847
00:44:37,951 --> 00:44:40,380
interfering with the flow of 
conversation.

848
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:42,870
Freud was very good at listening in that
manner.

849
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,620
Well that happens with jokes too.
You know,

850
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,553
like for example,
when I was showing you guys the lion 

851
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:52,224
king stills the other day,
and I showed you that picture of Nella 

852
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:58,380
laying on her back with that peculiar 
expression on her face.

853
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:03,450
Everybody immediately laughed.
And the Freud would have considered that

854
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:06,750
an entry point into the unconscious 
because there a reason you were laughing

855
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:07,584
about it.
It goes along with it well would have 

856
00:45:08,671 --> 00:45:11,250
gotten along with a sexual complex and 
that situation.

857
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,670
And everybody recognizes it instantly 
and they laugh about it.

858
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:18,330
And comedians are really good at that 
because if they're good comedians,

859
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,970
they say what everyone's thinking.
But no one will say,

860
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,130
and it's a relief to everyone.
You know?

861
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:24,840
Uh,
what's his name?

862
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:25,674
Uh,

863
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,670
Canadian comedian.

864
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,130
So always making racial jokes.
No,

865
00:45:32,131 --> 00:45:33,090
no,
it's Canadian.

866
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:34,500
Yeah,
Russell.

867
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:35,490
Russell Peters.
I mean,

868
00:45:35,491 --> 00:45:37,080
he's a great example of that.
You know,

869
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,093
he feels the whole stadium with people 
of all different ethnicities and every 

870
00:45:41,101 --> 00:45:41,934
single one of them is dying to be 
insulted because of their racial 

871
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:45,270
background.
You know,

872
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,520
it's a relief to everyone.
So he had salts,

873
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:49,800
the herbs,
and then he insults the Jews and then he

874
00:45:49,801 --> 00:45:51,280
insults the Christians.
And everybody's going,

875
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,230
Oh,
I'm so glad.

876
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:54,450
Finally someone said that,
you know,

877
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:55,284
so,
so he's speaking to part of their 

878
00:45:56,791 --> 00:45:57,624
unconscious and it's the part that's 
actually uncomfortable with all of that 

879
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,470
kind of discussion being repressed and 
staying below the surface.

880
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:05,304
It's way too weighty for people.
So jokes express in playful language 

881
00:46:09,361 --> 00:46:10,194
would culture will not formally express.
So you know too that when the culture 

882
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:16,170
starts going after the comedians that 
things are not good.

883
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:17,223
So you should leave the damn comedians 
alone because there are the people that 

884
00:46:19,531 --> 00:46:21,690
can tell the truth.
And if you start to get annoyed at them,

885
00:46:21,691 --> 00:46:23,940
then that's not good.
So,

886
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:31,180
so Freud was also extraordinarily 
interested in dreams.

887
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:36,710
Poor Freud who are just not going to be 
able to cover them in enough detail.

888
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,053
Well,

889
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:41,763
how will we do this?
Cause I should tell you about the 

890
00:46:43,361 --> 00:46:44,194
dreams.

891
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,970
Freud wrote a book called the 
interpretation of dreams.

892
00:46:48,971 --> 00:46:51,850
And he,
he was the first person I would say,

893
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:55,030
who subjected dreams to a really 
comprehensive analysis.

894
00:46:55,031 --> 00:46:55,864
And he used them to investigate the 
place of complexes in his 

895
00:47:01,541 --> 00:47:02,374
psychotherapeutic practice so his 
clients would recount their dreams to 

896
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:05,643
have.
Now he believed that dreams always 

897
00:47:06,881 --> 00:47:07,714
expressed an unconscious wish.
And that was tied into his theory of 

898
00:47:10,811 --> 00:47:12,490
repression.
And so for example,

899
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,130
if you are very,
very sexually repressed,

900
00:47:15,131 --> 00:47:15,964
which was very common at the time,
then you'd have dreams with sexual 

901
00:47:18,881 --> 00:47:22,480
content that we're expressing the,
the uh,

902
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,380
expressing the undesirable fantasy 
essentially.

903
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:29,050
And by analyzing the dream you could get
down to,

904
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:31,990
you could get down to what was being 
repressed.

905
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:33,243
Now Freud believed that the dream more 
or less tied itself in knots trying to 

906
00:47:37,991 --> 00:47:38,824
hide its content in some sense and young
believed instead that the dream was 

907
00:47:42,161 --> 00:47:43,990
actually trying to be as clear as it 
could.

908
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:44,823
It just wasn't part of the,
let's call it the semantic memory 

909
00:47:47,351 --> 00:47:48,184
system.
It was,

910
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:50,680
it was more like a feeler out into the 
unknown.

911
00:47:50,681 --> 00:47:53,740
It was trying to represent things as 
clearly as it could.

912
00:47:53,741 --> 00:47:54,574
And so it's use of symbols and that sort
of thing wasn't so much to hide the 

913
00:47:58,061 --> 00:48:00,820
actual unpleasant content from the 
dreamer,

914
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,480
but to express it in the only language 
that the dream could use.

915
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:06,040
And so Freud,
of course,

916
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,200
also believed that some of that was 
true.

917
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:09,823
All right,
well,

918
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:10,683
we're going to have to stop there.
So since it's two o'clock so we'll see 

919
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,120
you on Tuesday.
