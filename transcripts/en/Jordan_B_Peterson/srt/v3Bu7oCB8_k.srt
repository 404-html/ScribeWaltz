1
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,340
All
the

2
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,070
books here.
They're all,

3
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:44,790
they're all at the coop.
Does anybody else missing syllabus then

4
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,610
this will be the set up was missing a
syllabus.

5
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:08,130
Anybody else?
All the,

6
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,450
all the readings at the top are in the
coursebook.

7
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,130
That's abnormal in the coffee and the
books that are listed below,

8
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:20,720
they're all separate books.
Okay.

9
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,310
Well let's just go over there.
Are you ready?

10
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,550
Okay,
let's go there.

11
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,420
Oh,
alright.

12
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,600
I should welcome my extension school
students too.

13
00:01:31,601 --> 00:01:34,200
We'll be looking at this morning.
Okay.

14
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,180
If you turn to the back of the syllabus
where it says two calendar of events,

15
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,020
the titles that are listed on the right
hand side are all chapters from the

16
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:44,850
coursebook that sap?
No moon coffee.

17
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,743
Okay.

18
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,520
And then if you look at reading list and
due dates,

19
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,880
so is it agile readings?
Those are all books that are responsive

20
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,350
to this one,
which is for weeks one to three or books

21
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,460
that are available at the coop.
Okay.

22
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,670
And the address for noman coffee is 13
olds for Massachusetts Avenue.

23
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,800
All right.
And as I said,

24
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:12,801
there's a mixture of
analytical psychology texts that's

25
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,950
basically young in psychology.
Some philosophy,

26
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:21,090
some literature and some more
neuropsychology and not basically covers

27
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:25,860
the domain of the course.
So I'll start the introduction here.

28
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,660
Okay.
This is a course about

29
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,940
the causes of social conflict.
Um,

30
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,560
I'm not interested in social conflict
from the perspective of a political

31
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:46,080
scientist or a sociologist.
I'm interested in intergroup conflict,

32
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,560
but not at the level of group analysis.
I'm interested in what role social

33
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:56,340
identity or group identity plays in
individual psychology and why it is that

34
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:59,770
individuals are motivated to participate
in acts of conflict.

35
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,250
Um,
are you using for an example here,

36
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:07,210
the Holocaust,
I was thinking last week reading part of

37
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:11,170
the preface to the book that you're
going to read about the Holocaust museum

38
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:13,600
in Washington.
There was a lot of heads up,

39
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:18,040
obviously this is a museum to hope to
the Jews primarily who were killed by

40
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,790
the Nazis in World War Two.
And there's a number of museums like

41
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:25,630
this throughout the world and their
central model is never forget,

42
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,870
and this has always been confusing to
me.

43
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,280
It's notion of never forgetting because
I don't think you can remember something

44
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:37,000
that you don't understand.
And I don't think we understand why the

45
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:41,170
Holocaust happened in World War II.
I think.

46
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,920
I think you might regard the Holocaust
as none learned lesson and I don't think

47
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:51,420
that you can process information you
don't comprehend,

48
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,660
so we'll just say never forget things.
The question is what is it that you're

49
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:57,230
supposed to remember and use it?

50
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,200
The fact that 6 million people were
killed,

51
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,350
does it?
Is it the fact of that particular event

52
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:06,250
or are you supposed to be giving some
consideration to holocaust like events

53
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:09,520
that have occurred through history.
There are people who think that what

54
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:12,220
happened in World War II was a
relatively unique event of something

55
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:16,300
unparalleled in history.
This is not a position that I adopt.

56
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:19,420
I think actually it's a very common sort
of event.

57
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,970
It was perhaps
it was the event of that sort that has

58
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:29,890
proved most shocking to the European
conscience,

59
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,980
so to speak,
but it's hardly strikes me as unique and

60
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,360
people often talk about the Holocaust in
terms of the relationship between the

61
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:42,580
Jews and the Germans are between the
Jews and the Nazis.

62
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,200
The Jews obviously playing the part of
victims and the Nazis often for always

63
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:49,570
playing the part of the perpetrators.
And of course this has absolutely

64
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:51,490
comprehensible from the historical point
of view,

65
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,140
but it also strikes me that if what we
remember is that the Nazis killed the

66
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:59,710
Jews that were already on the road to
making a mistake that similar to the

67
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:04,120
mistake that was made that led to the
Holocaust to begin with,

68
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:08,560
which is to identify characteristics
that lead to patterns of action of that

69
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:12,970
sort as characteristics of groups
identifiable groups.

70
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,600
And it seems to me,
I mean I'm not trying to equate the role

71
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:19,390
of the Jews and the Nazis and producing
the Holocaust that would obviously be

72
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:22,240
observed,
but what I'm trying to say is that the

73
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:23,830
last one,
it seems to me to be,

74
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:28,831
especially when you consider that the
propensity for home costs like events is

75
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:34,390
deeply rooted in human nature.
The lesson to draw from the events of

76
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:36,970
World War II with the,
that's what human beings are like,

77
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,650
not what the Nazis were like because
these sorts of events happen all the

78
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:42,131
time.
I mean,

79
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:46,480
it's obviously the case that there are
well in the 20th century alone,

80
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,550
English and bent at the concentration
camp in South Africa,

81
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,300
Germans,
her fact that Chinese used it to great

82
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:57,220
advantage,
Solzhenitsyn estimated,

83
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,460
I'll show this on the next slide.
66 million people in the Soviet Union

84
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,770
were killed as a consequence of internal
repression,

85
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,150
many of whom went through camp like
procedures on their road to their

86
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:08,984
demise.

87
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,030
See ethnic cleansing occurring in places
like Rwanda and even once again in

88
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:17,990
Europe and the Balkans,
whatever it was that we were supposed to

89
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,950
learn from the events of the Second
World War hasn't been learned nor being

90
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,740
remembered because you can't remember
what you don't understand.

91
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,010
That's what this course is about.
I'm,

92
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:33,250
I've been working for since 1985 I guess
on trying to figure out what it is

93
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:34,730
about.
People

94
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,720
remember how to read that.
Maybe you know this,

95
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:41,840
maybe don't.
She's a famous political scientists.

96
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:44,870
She was a student of Martin heidegger.
She wrote a book called the banality of

97
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,690
evil and one of her points was that
these people,

98
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,390
she was talking about the Nazis in
particular,

99
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,940
people who perpetrate events like this.
If you meet them,

100
00:06:53,941 --> 00:06:56,360
if you talk to them,
if you have encounter with them,

101
00:06:56,361 --> 00:07:00,470
the thing that's often striking about
them is not their striking abnormality

102
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:03,380
or their evidence to eval,
but the fact that they're very much like

103
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:07,590
other people that you might've met,
which was suppose putting be surprises.

104
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,620
So surprising when you think about how
thoroughly,

105
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:12,410
for example,
the Nazi movement dominated the German

106
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:15,650
punches and sort of likewise with
communism in the Soviet Union.

107
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:18,740
I mean those ideological movements
characterize people.

108
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:23,741
They didn't characterize some strange
sort of misfits whose consciousness was

109
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:28,730
characterized by something in
comprehensible that led them to perform

110
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:31,220
the kind of actions that we are
theoretically supposed to remember.

111
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,060
My perspective on all of the assistants,
the fact that people are capable of

112
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,700
perpetrating atrocities like those that
characterized the Holocaust.

113
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,820
It says something about what people are
like,

114
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,320
what everybody's like,
because it's strikes me that that kind

115
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:54,740
of tendency is something that's deeply
rooted in human nature and then to say

116
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,960
that,
but what was it about the Nazis or what

117
00:07:56,961 --> 00:08:00,890
was it about the Soviet communists that
led them to participate in this sort of

118
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:03,950
behavior is completely decided to point
in a sense.

119
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,980
All that does is you're looking for some
sort of group characteristic.

120
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,550
It's devoid and you don't have any
personal relationship with that group.

121
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:13,580
The problem is instantly made abstract
and as far as I'm concerned,

122
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,860
if it's abstract,
well then once again,

123
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:20,720
nothing is remembered and what I want to
do is to try to,

124
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,500
I want to outline the reasons why.
Something like the whole,

125
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:29,540
the costs incurred,
what it is about us that make us so

126
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,760
concerned with protecting our group
identities,

127
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,990
what those identities mean,
what role they play in the regulation of

128
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:37,970
emotion.
That's the critical thing right there

129
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,150
for me,
idiot ologies are,

130
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,700
are,
are the expression in a sense,

131
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:48,350
the verbal expression of the internal
structures that regulate our emotions.

132
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,480
When you mess around with someone's
ideologies.

133
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,300
Therefore as a consequence,
you're messing around with the

134
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:56,760
inhibitory structure that regulates the
interplay between their emotions.

135
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,110
So we're going to study in part in this
course of what emotions are and how

136
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:04,380
they're rooted in neuropsychology and
neurophysiology and how they manifest

137
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:07,440
themselves and behavior and how they
might be controlled and how that might

138
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:11,190
tie into something as abstract as social
identity.

139
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,370
Usually there's no question that a link
made between the concept of sociological

140
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,000
processes,
so to speak,

141
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,390
and inter psychic processes or
neuropsychological structures,

142
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:23,820
but it's obviously,
if you think about it for a moment that

143
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:29,030
whatever your identity is plays some
role in regulating your emotional nature

144
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:33,960
and your of your physiology because your
thoughts are embodied.

145
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:35,960
They're part of your mind,
you're part of your brain.

146
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,500
Do you want to get right down to it?
People have belief systems and they'll

147
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:45,330
do anything to protect and I find that
peculiar is what is it that's so

148
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:48,180
important about belief system that would
lead people to do things.

149
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,560
Normal people as far as I'm concerned,
to commit acts that under normal

150
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:57,561
circumstances would would be conceived
of as incomprehensible even by those

151
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:02,310
people.
So I also hope to make,

152
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,360
as I said,
I want to make the lessons here

153
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,290
personal.
I'm not interested in discussing the

154
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:14,300
issue from the abstract perspective
because I don't think that an issue,

155
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,760
an issue of this magnitude deserves to
be discussed.

156
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:22,560
Data at an abstract level.
It's not an abstract problem.

157
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,340
It's something,
there's something peculiar about us that

158
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:29,370
we have to learn to control because as
far as I'm concerned,

159
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,020
we're to the technologically powerful to
remain at the whims of the

160
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:39,021
uncomprehending aspects of our nature
piece,

161
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,020
predictability and the delusion of self
representation.

162
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,430
What does that mean?
Well,

163
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,670
if you can predict something as a
general rule,

164
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:56,030
it's hard to determine why it is
that you think you understand something

165
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:58,800
when you think you do.

166
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,190
If you think about it for a moment,
it gets complicated because you're

167
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:05,850
surrounded by things that at some level
of analysis,

168
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:09,180
you cease to understand.
It doesn't matter what what phenomenon

169
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:12,810
it is,
and even even the most mundane objects

170
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:15,120
become mysterious.
If you look into them foreign,

171
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,450
take something as simple as a chairs
made out of wood.

172
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,440
That's all.
There's nothing remarkable about that.

173
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:24,650
But if you start to look into the
structure that wouldn't count.

174
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,470
Organism Mitre produced it.
All of the chemical reactions that go

175
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:31,770
about bringing that about and the
developmental history that led to the,

176
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,020
to the emergence of plants and trees.
But it can see that even in something

177
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:39,060
mundane or and banded all sorts of
mysteries.

178
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:41,820
But for the large part we traded show
something.

179
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:45,420
We understand well that's in part
because we're only concerned with it

180
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:48,060
with regards to its function.
And if it serves the function of being

181
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:50,820
able to be sat upon,
then we don't pay any more attention to

182
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:54,250
it.
So we think that if we can predict the

183
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:55,930
behavior or something that we understand
it.

184
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:59,860
So in peace when we observe ourselves
acting peacefully,

185
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,410
we presume that we'd got ourselves under
control,

186
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:06,070
that we actually do understand about
each other because we can predict the

187
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:08,100
behavior of others.
Then we can predict their own behavior.

188
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,770
Now deludes us into thinking best
therefore our models of ourselves or

189
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:15,850
actual actually accurate representations
of what we're like,

190
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,830
wow,

191
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,490
the problem is in wartime we don't act
like we do in times of peace,

192
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,920
but then of course during war time when
people are committing violent or

193
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,850
socially aggressive acts,
they don't really have all that much

194
00:12:27,851 --> 00:12:31,240
time to sit around and self reflect.
So it's not a time to be to be building

195
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:34,990
models about who it is that you are and
why it is that you're that way you're

196
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:38,410
too busy doing whatever it is that you
happen to be involved in to protect your

197
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:41,830
territory or to take someone else's
territory or two to expand your

198
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:46,420
ecological dominion or whatever it is.
Peaceful Times.

199
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,520
We look at ourselves,
can we see ourselves being peacefully

200
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,720
they bleed and nice name,
who make the precept position that as a

201
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,730
consequence,
that's what we're like and that we also

202
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:58,480
understand herself.
This is a big mistake because if you put

203
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:02,290
someone under extreme circumstances then
there will be things about them that

204
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,740
will be revealed to them that can only
be revealed under extreme circumstances

205
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:10,741
and it's extreme circumstances that were
concerned about in the course of this

206
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:12,820
course.

207
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,780
I want to find out,
I think that one of the things that

208
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:19,090
ideology does a group identity for that
matters,

209
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:23,140
regulating our emotions and if you're a
member of a community that has a

210
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:27,250
successful ideology and so the social
structure is basically stable and

211
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:30,490
successful,
then your emotions are regulated so well

212
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,470
that you don't even know that they're
there.

213
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,700
Just to say that you're protected by
something that you don't understand from

214
00:13:36,701 --> 00:13:40,270
something that you don't comprehend.
And when I want to do is open the gates

215
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:44,560
a little bit and let you see what's
underneath your comfortable social

216
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:49,120
identities and what it is that you're
protected from by the weight of your

217
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:49,954
history.

218
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,580
Well,
this is the central question I guess.

219
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:59,540
Then like first of all,
I think social aggression is a primary

220
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,600
Cuban characteristics.
If you even have a cursory knowledge of

221
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,210
history,
it's obviously the case work or plays in

222
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:08,870
the man's role.
And it seems to be the case that this is

223
00:14:08,871 --> 00:14:11,180
also true down the find a genetic
lottery.

224
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,860
I mean for a long time it was thought,
for example,

225
00:14:12,861 --> 00:14:17,390
the chimpanzees live peaceably and this
appears to be the case as long as you

226
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:22,391
studied chimpanzee's within their own
family or kin unit or I suppose roughly

227
00:14:22,401 --> 00:14:25,280
speaking tribe,
he had a piece of lead to each other

228
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,430
even in their dominance,
dominance dispute.

229
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:30,330
So usually settled more or less
peacefully good.

230
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,820
All discovered not so long ago that
chimpanzees conduct wars and clan wars

231
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:39,230
by,
by all occurrences when a chimp group is

232
00:14:39,231 --> 00:14:43,100
faced with an interloper from another
group or with another group that they're

233
00:14:43,101 --> 00:14:45,110
capable of engaging in the same sort of
behavior,

234
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,590
have much,
much more fundamental level in the sense

235
00:14:48,591 --> 00:14:52,640
that we are and also seems to be the
case as we'll see a little bit later in

236
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,530
this discussion that similar things are
true.

237
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,150
Even animals is as simple,
so to speak is wrapped,

238
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,010
uh,
looks like the capacity for.

239
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:03,740
So it's strange.
It's strange because it's obvious that

240
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:06,680
people have a tremendous capacity for
social affiliation.

241
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,180
I mean,
we made groups in the West.

242
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:10,940
People are usually considered as rugged
individual,

243
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:12,110
less so to speak,
but it's all,

244
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,240
it's the case.
Even in the most individualistic of

245
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:17,570
societies that were constantly in
contact with other people.

246
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,430
Almost all our environment,
there's other people,

247
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,270
we're all members of literally often
dozens of groups,

248
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:27,500
families and in groups devoted towards
certain tasks and and so on and so

249
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:28,251
forth.
We're very,

250
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:31,040
very,
very social thrive in a social

251
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,050
community.
But it looks like the flip side of that

252
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:36,950
is the fact that we're so capable of
making social groups also makes us very

253
00:15:36,951 --> 00:15:40,370
capable of organized aggression against
other social groups.

254
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:42,890
So it's,
it's the strange phenomena that it's our

255
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:47,891
very capacity for social organization
that also gives us this terrible

256
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:49,520
capacity for social aggression.

257
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,550
So that's another thing that I want to
take a look at it of course,

258
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,160
like I really want to get at the core of
this too.

259
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:56,950
I,
like I said ago,

260
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,290
I'm not interested in messing around
with a question on an abstract level.

261
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:05,650
I want to end the course with concrete
answers about why it is that people are

262
00:16:07,371 --> 00:16:10,800
capable of doing the sorts of things
that characterize not to behavior say

263
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:14,060
during the Holocaust.
I want to make that so crystal clear

264
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:19,061
that you can map out the argument from
precept position a tick to conclusion d

265
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,100
so that it's socially and personally
approved,

266
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,640
clickable and so that you also get a
glimpse perhaps of what might be

267
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:33,641
necessary from the perspective of
personal and interpersonal conduct to

268
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,540
alleviate the likelihood that you'll get
trapped into doing something like that.

269
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,380
It's one of the things you pointed out
cause he was very concerned with events.

270
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,130
The second reward and social aggression
in general,

271
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:50,170
he said you have to understand is that
these great evils tend to take place one

272
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:54,130
small step at a time.
Do people get tracked into them over a

273
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,490
long period of time?
You make a small bad error but it

274
00:16:58,491 --> 00:17:02,240
doesn't look so big at the time at least
to another type of error.

275
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:05,000
That snot so baby as well.
And that leads to a third era and he

276
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:07,160
spoke so big.
But if you've put together 40 of those

277
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:10,340
areas or 50 of those errors and all of a
sudden you see that someone's traveling

278
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:13,940
down a road to a place where they might
not want it to have gone in the

279
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:15,710
beginning,
have they been conscious of it?

280
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:20,330
So one of the things about never
forgetting is to understand

281
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,590
is to engage in primary prevention,
so to speak,

282
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,700
which is to understand how the sweetness
in the second half of,

283
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,720
of course has to do with that issue,
particularly personal relationship to

284
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:37,050
group identity and group fostered
action.

285
00:17:37,051 --> 00:17:40,220
So the first part of the course
basically deals with why it is that

286
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:45,221
we're susceptible to social aggression
as a consequence of our biological

287
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:49,230
makeup.
What it is about us that makes us like

288
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:51,510
that.
And the second part of the course is

289
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:56,511
about how certain patterns of personal
calm down heighten the possibility is

290
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:02,880
socially aggressive acts will take place
and about how it is that you might avoid

291
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,890
engaging in all sorts of that.

292
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:11,680
That's
an overhead

293
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,730
detail.
Some of the things I've already

294
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,540
discovered.
So good home here.

295
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,110
I'm going to tell you a story from the
Soviet Union.

296
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,570
It's soldier knit some total.
He introduces it with the home from the

297
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:33,571
Russian poet Mayakovsky
with cohesion,

298
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,270
construction,
grit and repression.

299
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,590
Bring the neck of this gang run riot.
That's nice.

300
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,920
Pole social knits and wondering who was
the game.

301
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,510
That's the question.
As I said,

302
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:51,540
he has to make 66 million people died.
The Soviet Union between 1917 to 1959

303
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,260
Solzhenitsyn also estimated that is
substantially larger number of parish in

304
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,330
Communist China.
No one really knows the staffs on that.

305
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,560
Now this is a debatable statistic as
Social Nixon points out in this book,

306
00:19:02,561 --> 00:19:05,470
this is from the Gulag archipelago.
As he said,

307
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,390
as soon as the official statistics are
released to revise his estimates.

308
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,720
This includes,
for example,

309
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,990
several millions million hasn't pushed
into the Tundra and forced relocation in

310
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:21,510
your early twenties 6 million
Ukrainians,

311
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,180
we six months.
You have even the famines in the 1930s

312
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,260
pretty good a story.

313
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,660
So this is the situation.

314
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,680
So what did,
did she tell you a little bit about his

315
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:49,410
life story?
You go like archipelago is a three

316
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:53,640
volume.
The second volume of which you will read

317
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,100
is his story about the blue light.
Good light.

318
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,120
It was a system of forced labor camps
set up in the Soviet Union soon after

319
00:20:04,381 --> 00:20:05,800
late and die.
In fact,

320
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,220
yes,
some of them were set up before he died

321
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,670
and upon which the Soviet economy duty
ran for much of,

322
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:14,760
it's for much of what constituted its
life.

323
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:19,230
Soldier Solzhenitsyn's started,
he has traveled through the ghoulag

324
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,530
originally as a Russian is frontline
soldier.

325
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:27,650
So neat story and Sam's got thrown into
a German prisoner of war camp and when

326
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:33,741
he was repatriated to the Soviet Union
stabling through Beta in a concentration

327
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:36,530
camp.
And the reason was as he did with all

328
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:40,740
the return Russian prisoners of war who
are treated by the way terribly and the

329
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:45,060
German prisoners of war camps because
stellman refused to sign the Geneva

330
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,290
Convention on the treatment of
prisoners.

331
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,700
So not only were they in prisoners of
war camps,

332
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,860
which was miserable enough that they
were starved to the degree that the

333
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,710
other allied prisoners used to give them
food.

334
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,460
They didn't have much food themselves,
so he was a front line soldier.

335
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:03,610
Then he got thrown in a German prisoner
of war camp and then when he finally

336
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:06,430
returned to Russia,
Stellan through and the concentration

337
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:10,390
camp,
and the reason for that was that the

338
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:15,391
Russians who were in German prisoners of
war camp had been contaminated by their

339
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:18,820
exposure to western ideas and that was
his rationale.

340
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,690
So anyways,
then he spent a decade and a half or

341
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,930
thereabouts and concentration camps,
but when he got out he developed stomach

342
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:29,980
cancer.
So that's a brief summary of some of the

343
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:31,990
highlights of his life.
Okay.

344
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:35,410
In this scene,
he's being transported from one camp to

345
00:21:35,411 --> 00:21:36,950
another.
You know,

346
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,850
a railway car that's being roughly
outfitted for transporting human beings.

347
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,510
He's sitting with the friend that he
calls panic.

348
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:48,530
I'm just going to read you this story.
My friend pattern and I are lying on the

349
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,900
Middle Shelf of a stall up in
compartment.

350
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:52,420
That's what it was.
Cattle cars basically to refit it for

351
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,330
human transport and have set ourselves
up comfortably,

352
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,290
talk to our salt carrying in our pocket
so we don't need water and can go to

353
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:02,740
sleep.
But at some station or other,

354
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,700
they shoved into our compartment.
A Marxist scholar.

355
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,390
We can tell this from his goatee and
spectacles.

356
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:13,000
He doesn't hide the fact.
So He's been arrested.

357
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,420
He's a devout communist,
being arrested by the communists.

358
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,060
He doesn't hide the fact.
He's a former professor of the

359
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,570
guardianist academy.
We hang head down in the square,

360
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:27,220
cut out from his very first words.
We see that he is impenetrable,

361
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:32,760
but we have been serving time for a very
long time and have a long time left to

362
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,990
serve and we value of Mary joke.

363
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,780
We'd was pointing down,
have fun.

364
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,350
There's ample space left in the
compartment.

365
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,020
So we exchanged places with someone and
crowd in.

366
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,540
Hello?
Hello?

367
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,270
You don't too crowded?
No,

368
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:52,480
it's all right.
Have you been in the jug a long time?

369
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:56,260
Long enough or you past the halfway
mark?

370
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,280
Just
look over there.

371
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:03,520
How poverty stricken her villages are.
Straw thatch,

372
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:08,230
crooked hugs.
That's an inheritance heritance from the

373
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:13,120
czarist regime.
What we've already had 30 Soviet years.

374
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,940
That's an insignificant period.
Historic.

375
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,560
It's terrible that the collective
farmers are starving,

376
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:27,220
but have you look in all the wrappings
just ask any collective farber in

377
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,800
apartment.
Well,

378
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,180
everyone in jail is embittered and
prejudice,

379
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,080
but I've seen collective farms myself.
That means they were uncharacteristic.

380
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,930
The goatee had never been in any of them
that way.

381
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:41,923
Simpler.

382
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,260
Just ask the old folks and bizarre.
They were well fed,

383
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,100
well clothed,
and they used to have many holidays.

384
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,600
I'm not even going to ask.
It's a subjective trait of human memory

385
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:00,770
to praise everything in the past.
The cow or the died is the one that gave

386
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:05,290
twice the milk.
Sometimes even certain problems and

387
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,420
there are people don't like holidays.
They like to work.

388
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:14,630
Why is there a shortage of brandon?
Many cities when right before the war,

389
00:24:14,631 --> 00:24:17,960
for example,
not true before the war,

390
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:23,060
everything in fact and be more.
Listen at that time in all the cities on

391
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,610
the pool guy,
they were accused of thousands of

392
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:28,730
people,
a local failure and supply.

393
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,350
More likely your memory's failing you,
but there this shortage.

394
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:38,351
Now old wives tales we have from seven
to 8 billion bushels of grain.

395
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:44,570
The grain is rotten,
not so we've been very successful in

396
00:24:44,571 --> 00:24:46,310
developing new species,
great

397
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,793
and so forth.

398
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,430
He's going to perturb level.
He speaks in the language between

399
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:55,250
quarters,
no effort of the mind and arguing with

400
00:24:55,251 --> 00:24:59,510
him is like walking through a desert.
It's about people like that,

401
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:03,290
but they say he made the rounds of all
the blocks smiths and came home on Shawn

402
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:09,630
and when they write in their obituaries
perished tragically during the period of

403
00:25:09,631 --> 00:25:13,460
the stone in this cult,
it should be corrected to read perished

404
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:16,880
comically benefits.
Faith had worked out differently.

405
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:20,270
We would have never learned what a dry,
insignificant little man he really was.

406
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,700
We would have respectfully read his name
in the newspaper.

407
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,920
We would have,
he would have become a people's

408
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:28,220
commissar or even ventured to represent
the whole Russia abroad.

409
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,430
To argue with him.
It was useless.

410
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,620
It was much more interesting to play
with.

411
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:38,360
It don't a chess,
but at the game of comrades already is

412
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:39,194
such a game.

413
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,940
It's very simple game play up to him.
A couple of times or so,

414
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,370
you used some of his own pet words and
phrases.

415
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,180
He'll like that phrase,
grown accustomed to find it all around

416
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:53,650
him are enemies.
He's become weary of snarling and

417
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:57,230
doesn't like to tell his stories because
all of them will be twisted and thrown

418
00:25:57,231 --> 00:26:00,560
right back into space.
But if he takes you for one of his own,

419
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,510
he will quite.
Keven only disclosed to you.

420
00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:06,380
What have you seen at the station?
People are passing by talking,

421
00:26:06,381 --> 00:26:08,000
laughing.
Life goes on.

422
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:12,530
The party is providing leadership.
People are being moved from job to job.

423
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,290
If you and I are languishing here in
prison,

424
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,760
there are only a handful of us and we
must write and write petitions,

425
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:22,460
begging a review of our cases for a
pardon

426
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,360
or he will tell you something
interesting.

427
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,540
In the Communist Academy,
they decided to devour one program and

428
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,970
he decided he wasn't quite genuine,
one of our own and somehow they couldn't

429
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:39,980
manage it.
There were no errors in his assets and

430
00:26:39,981 --> 00:26:43,950
his biography was clean and all of a
sudden going through the archives,

431
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,580
what a fine.
They ran across an old brochure written

432
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:51,750
by his comrade in which Vladimir Ilyich
Lenin himself had held in his hands.

433
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,600
And in the margin of which he had
written in his own handwriting.

434
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,930
The notation has it in the economist is
shit,

435
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:03,080
well now you understand or smile
essentially,

436
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,840
but after that it's no trouble at all to
make short work of that model.

437
00:27:06,841 --> 00:27:10,680
Hadn't paused.
He was expelled from the academy and

438
00:27:10,681 --> 00:27:15,681
deprived of the scholar.
This story.

439
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:32,180
That's a perfect example of the kind of
phenomena that I'm interested in trying

440
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:36,960
to understand.
The communist professor,

441
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,790
this exchange,
he doesn't think,

442
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,060
it doesn't have to think because he has
an ideological system that time it

443
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,913
worked out.

444
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:50,750
He won't admit
any evidence whatsoever exists to

445
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:53,490
suggest that some of his presuppositions
are wrong.

446
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:58,680
For every bit of evidence that exists,
there is a counter argument that

447
00:27:58,681 --> 00:28:02,820
justifies it or excuse it or makes it
disappear in some way.

448
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:07,800
That's the first part of this story.
The second part of the story is that

449
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:13,310
being like this,
he's also extraordinarily clannish in a

450
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:15,780
sense.
Can you tell us a brief story about

451
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:21,630
being in the Communist Academy where
everyone shares in urology and finding

452
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,640
outside yourself essentially destroyed
there specific reasons why the two

453
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:33,210
halves of that narrative,
we're stuck together because the first

454
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,320
attitude leads in absorb link to the
second attitude,

455
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,670
which is to say the adoption and
authoritarian etiology,

456
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:44,720
which is basically the presumption of
omniscience in a sense.

457
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,000
If you're an idiot,
you think that what you think is the

458
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:50,640
right thing thing.
There isn't anything else that needs to

459
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:51,300
be thought.

460
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,310
It's you that has the answer.
Now you might know,

461
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:55,170
thank it's you.
You might even think that it's your

462
00:28:55,171 --> 00:28:58,950
leader or the ideology in and of itself,
but the point is you're the one that's

463
00:28:58,951 --> 00:29:03,951
in possession of the absolute truth in
every fact that might exist to dispute

464
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:08,580
that is eliminated.
And a problem with the limited facts is

465
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,650
that sometimes they come in and body
form,

466
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:14,250
which is to say we tend to think of
ideas as disembodied abstract and

467
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:16,250
entities,
but the truth of the matter is that

468
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,000
ideas are representations of human
patterns of action and sometimes the

469
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:26,001
enemy idea is actually the enemy.
And there's very little difference from

470
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:31,011
the practical perspective between
repressing facts that are uncomfortable

471
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,400
and repressing people whose viewpoints
or even styles of existence are equal in

472
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,250
long term.
So this is another example,

473
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,160
this sort of thinking that I want to
explain,

474
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,190
I want to spend the motivation for that.

475
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:50,430
Why is it that someone would adopt a
rigid ideological position and then

476
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:56,190
defend it sometimes to their own debt
but more frequently to the death of

477
00:29:56,351 --> 00:29:59,440
others and to feel that not only is that
is that

478
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,000
acceptable,
we'd often even morally justifiable.

479
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:07,760
It's is the thing that should be done.
You're a good Patriot so just

480
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,270
so
this is the quick thesis.

481
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,180
This is what I want to address and of
course

482
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,800
I don't want to use this.
I said I don't want to take a stab at

483
00:30:29,801 --> 00:30:34,220
the question so to speak.
I don't want to beat around the Bush on

484
00:30:34,221 --> 00:30:37,630
an answer these so that when you're
finished of course you will.

485
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,640
What purpose group identification
serves,

486
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,450
why it's so important to people,
how it developed,

487
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,820
what it means to have a belief.
People have beliefs.

488
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,600
We never really,
a question we get is what it means

489
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,420
when you say that.
I have,

490
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,890
I think the world is in a particular way
as opposed to some other particular way.

491
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,130
Why do we feel threatened?
We were in groups.

492
00:31:03,131 --> 00:31:08,131
We identify with our challenged.
Why does challenge me as aggressive and

493
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,150
righteously and sort of the core.
I guess those are the core questions of

494
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:14,110
course centers around.

495
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,900
There's more I can describe the whole,
of course.

496
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:24,901
Obviously it's the first lecture.
This is about half the half the story.

497
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:31,050
I'm also interested in how our own
personal behaviors make our group

498
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,840
identification more or less dangerous
and what can be done about that as well.

499
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,250
Okay,
so

500
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:58,470
do you understand why we are capable of
atrocious behavior?

501
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,150
You have to understand how we think and
I want to approach that from a variety

502
00:32:07,151 --> 00:32:10,700
of different perspectives giving you
initially he grounding and mortar neuro

503
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:15,400
psychology or psychology and emotion and
emotional regulation because that puts

504
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:18,660
the discussion on what I think is a firm
foundation.

505
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,480
He said I bring in 10 political ideas
and ideas from literature and philosophy

506
00:32:22,481 --> 00:32:24,820
as well,
but it's nice to also have reference to

507
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:29,821
some facts that are acceptable as facts.
That's when you start,

508
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,340
you know,
psychology well,

509
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,380
how do we think this is half the store?
We'll discuss the other half as we go

510
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,223
through the course.

511
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,120
The course is
predicated on a theory of knowledge.

512
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:57,300
Let's suggest that we classify objects
in situations according to two separate

513
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:03,740
types of schemes.
And the first type of scheme is one that

514
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,990
everyone was essentially familiar with
apps.

515
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,690
The scientific scheme that makes the
presupposition that there's an objective

516
00:33:11,691 --> 00:33:16,330
world that's apprehensible to the census
make,

517
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:20,960
can be collectively describe,
which is only to say that the thing is

518
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:22,910
real,
if you can sense it,

519
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:27,290
choose me means if you can touch it or
see it or in some other way detected.

520
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:31,400
If you can describe the price procedures
by which now detection.

521
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:34,400
Oh Curd.
And if someone else duplicating those

522
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:39,130
procedures comes up with this same
observations and that's a real thing and

523
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,740
that's a fact.
It's a scientific fact and we've been

524
00:33:42,741 --> 00:33:47,741
able to codify a methodology for
determining what is from the objective

525
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:53,300
perspective and I don't think there's,
there's no real reason to dispute that

526
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,100
seems more or less self evident.

527
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,330
It's a relatively new procedure.
We've only been really good at it for

528
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,470
500 years at the most.
It's going to be in that long since the

529
00:34:03,471 --> 00:34:07,190
scientific enterprise is being
transformed into something that was

530
00:34:07,191 --> 00:34:09,770
actually codify.
It's obviously an extraordinary

531
00:34:09,771 --> 00:34:14,600
efficient way to proceed and there's no
point in a sense,

532
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:20,360
been debating is utility.
That's one type of

533
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,430
knowledge scheme,
but there's another type

534
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:32,430
that people have spent much less time
formalize it partly because it's more

535
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:35,930
difficult before we want to say with
regards to the scientific method,

536
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:39,410
we more or less have a set of agreed
upon rules by which the endeavor should

537
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:44,030
proceed and also by which to judge the
validity of the outcomes of the

538
00:34:44,031 --> 00:34:45,980
procedures.
You can write them down.

539
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:48,860
They're very much formalized.
That's why almost anybody can do

540
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:51,770
scientific research,
especially the type of scientific

541
00:34:51,771 --> 00:34:53,720
research that Tom is tuned described as
normal,

542
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,690
which basically means that you have a
set theory what's you're not trying to

543
00:34:56,691 --> 00:34:59,900
challenge and working with him to theory
to more or less flesh it out,

544
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,320
so a technician putting into work potent
technical tools that you can virtually

545
00:35:07,581 --> 00:35:08,414
do by rote.

546
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,880
Anyways,
we figured out how to formalize that.

547
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,460
That's an answer to the question.
What is,

548
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,270
how to control things.
The second type of inflammation.

549
00:35:17,271 --> 00:35:21,440
That's the type of that I am concerned
in this course and that is not what a

550
00:35:21,441 --> 00:35:26,441
thing is from the objective perspective
but about what it is from the

551
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:31,400
perspective of determining its
implications for behavior and to say,

552
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:35,900
well there are things and there is also
knowledge about how to behave in your

553
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:39,540
presence.
First kind of information you might

554
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:42,780
consider.
The second kind of inflammation is more

555
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:46,470
akin to what has been traditionally
described as wisdom because wisdom is

556
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:48,480
the knowledge of how to conduct
yourself.

557
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:54,190
Things exist and the fact that their
existence has implications for behavior

558
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:59,640
and what's the implications of the
existence of things for behavior that I

559
00:35:59,641 --> 00:36:04,641
want to focus on.
Because in our social command it's we

560
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:09,951
come to agreements over vast stretches
of time about what sorts of behaviors

561
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:14,910
are to be considered appropriate in
which situations and under which

562
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:18,300
conditions,
and it's this agreement Atlantans

563
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,670
predictability to our interpersonal
relationships.

564
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:25,380
It can take an example just of this
course we all share map,

565
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:30,510
so to speak of what behaviors are
appropriate in a situation like this.

566
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,170
And essentially what that means is that
we can come in here and conduct our

567
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:37,380
business and we all know what that
business is going to be.

568
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,910
There's no dispute about that and we all
know more or less what our respective

569
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:44,700
roles are going to be in conducting that
business.

570
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,890
There's no real,
there's no space for disputed at all,

571
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:51,090
which basically means that our shared
map of the significance of the events

572
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:53,790
that are occurring in this room
eliminates the need for conflict.

573
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,250
We don't even have,
we don't have fight about what's going

574
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:57,990
to happen here.
We don't have to fight about who owns

575
00:36:57,991 --> 00:37:01,770
that sunkist orange juice or who's going
to take control of the pens or who owns

576
00:37:01,771 --> 00:37:03,960
that particular computer or who's going
to,

577
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,500
or how the,
how the discussion is going to proceed.

578
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,030
That's all mapped out for us in some
ways and that means that we've rendered

579
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,360
ourselves in this particular situation
predictable,

580
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:20,930
which means that there's no reason for
any of us to regard any of the other

581
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,940
people in the room with any sort of
apprehension whatsoever.

582
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:28,320
So in a sense you could say that for me,
you're a fixed object in terms of your

583
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:31,440
significance in this environment.
And the reason for that is because we're

584
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:34,530
engaging in a culturally determined
process,

585
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,900
none of which were questioning or at
least that we've,

586
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:41,010
we've accepted implicitly or explicitly
and implicitly you're out of university.

587
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:42,780
This is what happens at a university,
you know,

588
00:37:42,781 --> 00:37:45,760
that I know of that we don't have to set
any of the ground.

589
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,240
Well,
it's our shared apprehensions about the

590
00:37:53,101 --> 00:37:57,930
implications of situations for behaviors
that constitute our cultures.

591
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:02,100
And it's those shared maps that bring
predictability to our interpersonal

592
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:02,740
relationships.

593
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:07,740
And what that essentially you can only
understand that if you understand what

594
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:09,840
the world is like when it's not
predictable.

595
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,280
And it's difficult to understand that
for water and people who live in

596
00:38:14,281 --> 00:38:18,270
peaceful times because our culture is so
successful at regulating our

597
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:21,000
interpersonal behavior and even the
environment for that matter.

598
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:25,290
But we hardly ever encounter a situation
where anything remotely unpredictable

599
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:27,600
happens.
So you can't tell what it's like to be

600
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:29,220
faced with something that's
unpredictable.

601
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,460
So you don't know what it's like when
you're in an environment where culture

602
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:35,290
doesn't rain because you're part of a
successful community in your

603
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:37,570
extraordinarily well protected it.
You're like,

604
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,510
you're like a boy that lives inside the
castle.

605
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,360
You can't see over the walls.
It doesn't even know that they're there

606
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:45,460
and just all sorts of terrible things
outside the castle.

607
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:49,690
But everything inside is peaceful and
that's the world and the boy has no idea

608
00:38:49,691 --> 00:38:52,660
what he would be like if he went outside
into the real world where things were

609
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:55,330
actually not predictable because he's
only had a chance to observe his

610
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:59,410
behavior under stable conditions where
everything's predictable and acceptable.

611
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:03,250
It's even worse now in a sense it's
better than waiting too.

612
00:39:03,251 --> 00:39:08,251
I mean he is peaceful now in many ways.
I mean even compared to 15 years ago,

613
00:39:09,401 --> 00:39:13,640
there's much less ideological dispute in
the world about how to conduct affairs.

614
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:17,650
Then there was staying in the mid
seventies and people are more or less,

615
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:19,030
I mean I know there's exceptions to
this,

616
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:22,210
but people in the world over have more
or less accepted in this basket.

617
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:23,950
For example,
for a market and economy,

618
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,790
there aren't very many ideologies that
appear attractive even in the

619
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:32,080
imagination in contrast to two western
style democracies and I mean not so

620
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:35,200
pretty recent occurrence and it's
unlikely to last for any great length of

621
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:35,801
time,
I think,

622
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:40,801
but it is peaceful now
that the fact that that piece makes it

623
00:39:41,831 --> 00:39:44,770
even more difficult for us to either to
understand ourselves or to be

624
00:39:44,771 --> 00:39:48,280
sufficiently motivated to understand
yourself because when things are going

625
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:50,050
really well and everything's
predictable,

626
00:39:50,051 --> 00:39:52,060
then you presume that you know what
you're doing.

627
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,600
In fact,
that's the basis on which you,

628
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,910
you base your judgments about whether
you know what you're doing,

629
00:39:57,911 --> 00:40:00,430
if you perform a procedure and what you
predicted,

630
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:01,180
oh,
occurs.

631
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,430
You're right.
Now that doesn't mean you know

632
00:40:03,431 --> 00:40:04,900
everything,
but as far as you're concerned,

633
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:05,734
that's sufficient.

634
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:11,210
So anyways,
the fundamental point is this.

635
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:17,410
We share a map of the significance of
things and situations including other

636
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:20,440
people,
including ourselves and not maps or

637
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,720
culture.
And one of the lines of arguments that I

638
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:27,560
want to develop throughout the course of
this course is that that shared culture

639
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,630
takes the form of a story.
In fact,

640
00:40:29,631 --> 00:40:34,130
that's what his story is.
A story is a description of the

641
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:39,131
significance of situations or events for
behavior and the stories.

642
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:45,190
The kind of inflammation story is a form
of information that transmits abstract

643
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:51,140
knowledge about how to add.
So you have on the one hand,

644
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:54,170
scientific descriptions are the
descriptions of facts,

645
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,340
things that are sensory apprehensible to
a collected and you had another form of

646
00:40:58,341 --> 00:41:02,000
information that's narrative and a
narrative contains information,

647
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,360
but how you should conduct yourself
literally how you should propel your

648
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:09,020
body through space under which
circumstances and the shared narrative

649
00:41:09,021 --> 00:41:10,040
post due to culture.

650
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:16,060
Yeah.
Let me show you,

651
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,000
but I think the basic structure of a
story,

652
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,013
okay.

653
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,540
Scientific description is concerned with
what is,

654
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:31,290
can we do?
We have rules for determining a story is

655
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:34,040
concerned with what is known from the

656
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,490
perspective of the census.
But from the perspective of the

657
00:41:36,491 --> 00:41:41,210
implications for behave.
So that's the main essential things have

658
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:42,850
an existence.
They have a meaning and the story is

659
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:47,860
concerned with the meaning and
meaning is a description of the current

660
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:53,981
state description of the ideal future
state and the description of means of

661
00:41:55,521 --> 00:41:56,390
transformation.

662
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:16,780
You run a fantasy of the sort of three
so you have a plan,

663
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,270
a plan,
it's relevant to something you

664
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:24,640
termination of action.
You just want to go down to the corner

665
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:26,230
store,
get a loaf of bread.

666
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:31,870
You can see above yourself here as
lacking something necessary,

667
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,460
apprehended in the abstract and an ideal
goal,

668
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:41,200
which is your trip down to the store and
you also formulating plans of how to get

669
00:42:41,201 --> 00:42:43,090
there and you,
you,

670
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:48,110
you valuate oh occurrences on the way to
this store in relationship to two year

671
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,990
idealized future.
Just to say that anything that gets in

672
00:42:52,991 --> 00:42:54,950
your way basically on the way to this
store,

673
00:42:54,951 --> 00:42:58,270
if you're in a hurry for example,
that's regarded as an inconvenience.

674
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,770
Anything that hurries you along?
Yes,

675
00:42:59,771 --> 00:43:03,850
regarded it as something positive.
Just basically to say that you use your

676
00:43:03,851 --> 00:43:07,390
apprehension of the ideal future,
which is always construed in

677
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:12,391
relationship to your present conditions
as the Schema by which you determine the

678
00:43:12,611 --> 00:43:17,200
significance of things.
Because you're always construing the

679
00:43:17,201 --> 00:43:21,010
meaning of things in relationship to
what you want to do in relationship to

680
00:43:21,011 --> 00:43:24,040
this function.
And this basically constitutes the

681
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:26,940
whole,
the whole story in a sense,

682
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,110
at least the simple version of it.

683
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,400
Okay.
Let me just stop there for a second.

684
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:47,570
Ask people questions.
And then next thing I want to do is give

685
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:52,571
you a really brief overview of how your
brain determines how things should be

686
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:57,770
evaluated in terms of their emotional
relevance.

687
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,200
Okay?
Does anybody have any questions so far

688
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,260
on the other,
the quality,

689
00:44:05,261 --> 00:44:07,190
you put up a,
what is the,

690
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,990
the ring then the Naccho though.
The,

691
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:09,980
the gang run,
right?

692
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,380
Is that,
that the bring the neck of the right or

693
00:44:12,381 --> 00:44:14,150
wring the neck of the people that are
under the,

694
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,610
uh,
under the federation.

695
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,680
It was the cup like that,
that poem was it.

696
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:24,130
It's by a poet,
I think his name was [inaudible] sst of

697
00:44:24,131 --> 00:44:27,550
eliminating descent.
So like there's this,

698
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,760
you could think the Soviet Union,
for example,

699
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:31,860
ran on a number of five year plans,

700
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,620
five year plans where we're going to,
we are here,

701
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:38,130
we're going to get to here.
Here are the means by which that's going

702
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:41,770
to be done.
Then anybody who was viewed as deviated

703
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:42,900
from that plan,
of course,

704
00:44:42,901 --> 00:44:46,800
was instantly regarded as a threat and
my costs in the same luck,

705
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,200
those are the gang run,
right?

706
00:44:48,201 --> 00:44:51,660
And fundamentally anybody who doesn't
agree with the forward portion of the

707
00:44:51,661 --> 00:44:54,950
current society instantly regarded well.
They're instantly regardless,

708
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:59,040
fundamentally hasn't it normally,
but more pragmatically as a threat.

709
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,740
And my costco was making the point that
those people,

710
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:04,730
they should be eliminated.
They deserve to be eliminated,

711
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,461
which is even,
you know,

712
00:45:05,461 --> 00:45:10,461
even a further step in a sense,
they constitute the class of things that

713
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:15,840
deserves to be annihilated because it's
construed in relationship to some ideal.

714
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:18,360
At the same.
You might be wondering,

715
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,360
why the hell was this a story?
What does this have to do with the

716
00:45:21,361 --> 00:45:22,920
story?
While I can give you the most,

717
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:25,080
the most fundamental example of the
census.

718
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:29,790
I want to tell you what stories are and
then I want to take a look at their

719
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:30,840
substructure.

720
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:33,243
Well,

721
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:37,190
the fact that there's a substructure to
stories as evidence in the number of

722
00:45:37,191 --> 00:45:39,500
subtle ways,
it's part of the epidemic because

723
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:44,720
myths that have been collected
throughout the world have a remarkably

724
00:45:44,721 --> 00:45:47,040
similar nature.
That's one,

725
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:50,900
one bit of information that's relatively
curious.

726
00:45:50,901 --> 00:45:53,450
It's also very strange,
but the people like stories.

727
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:57,620
Children will listen to stories and come
to any external reinforcement.

728
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,240
They're intrinsically rewarding.
People Watch tv all the time because TV

729
00:46:02,241 --> 00:46:05,270
is full of stories.
We pay to go see movies more by normals,

730
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:08,330
but something about stories that are
intrinsically attractive to the point

731
00:46:08,331 --> 00:46:11,020
that will actually work to be allowed to
becoming,

732
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:13,610
to be in contact with them,
which should beg the question.

733
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:16,010
Since we're willing to go to all that
trouble,

734
00:46:16,011 --> 00:46:18,800
to,
to look at stories and to receive them,

735
00:46:18,801 --> 00:46:21,020
perhaps they're actually serving some
function.

736
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,500
It seemed at least at least reasonable
in the function.

737
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:29,510
There's certainly
story.

738
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,510
Good story is what regulates your
emotions.

739
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,370
And if you share a story with someone
else,

740
00:46:34,371 --> 00:46:37,940
then you can predict them and both your
emotions are making a group of you share

741
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,200
the store,
then you have the culture and you're all

742
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:43,280
more or less predictable to one another.
It's a very useful because then you can

743
00:46:43,281 --> 00:46:46,190
be organized and you could move forward
in one direction and so on.

744
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,800
But most of your predictable tomorrow
say

745
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:55,580
shoe to make the story aspect of this
more comprehensible.

746
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:58,850
You might think of this as political
utopia.

747
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,600
That's one way of doing it or as a
vision of paradise.

748
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:07,810
And then that's the archetypical aspect
of underlies the notion that the future

749
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,920
could in fact be better than the
present.

750
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:12,230
Even in trivial waste.
We're doing this all the time.

751
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:16,940
We're always moving from a state that we
can see them as not entirely ideal

752
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,100
towards a state,
that we can see them even in the

753
00:47:19,101 --> 00:47:21,860
smallest ways as somehow better than
where we work.

754
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,470
And that's the sort of thing in fact,
gives us the impetus to move forward in

755
00:47:25,471 --> 00:47:26,600
the,
in a literal sense.

756
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,900
But underlying that is the notion way
under so to speak is the notion that the

757
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:36,970
world as it is presently constructed is
somehow we needed redemption and there

758
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:40,930
is a state hypothetical state that
exists somewhere in the future,

759
00:47:40,931 --> 00:47:43,630
so to speak,
or somewhere at least towards which the

760
00:47:43,631 --> 00:47:46,360
world could move in all religious
stories,

761
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:49,720
all religious systems share that sort of
notion of clinical that you told use as

762
00:47:49,721 --> 00:47:49,900
well.

763
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,360
I mean it's really evident in the case
of something like,

764
00:47:52,361 --> 00:47:53,400
Connie,
this is call me.

765
00:47:53,401 --> 00:47:58,401
This was always trying to establish
the Kingdom of God on earth,

766
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:01,090
so to speak.
Although of course without theoretically

767
00:48:01,091 --> 00:48:06,010
without the religious overtones,
it of course we've just made implicit

768
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:08,380
instead of instead of being allowed to
be,

769
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:12,850
to be explicit because Stellan was as
close to a god and a pretty miserable

770
00:48:12,851 --> 00:48:17,470
one is any religion hasn't managed to
construct.

771
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,190
This isn't a simple story.
Basically stories have a slightly more

772
00:48:21,191 --> 00:48:23,560
complicated structure than this,
which we'll discuss later.

773
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,470
How would you distinguish or how do you
distinguish between the strategy and the

774
00:48:28,471 --> 00:48:32,260
story?
This would be a strategy in here.

775
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:34,930
A strategy is just,
that's a good question.

776
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:39,280
This is actually,
this is somewhat simpler then the real

777
00:48:39,281 --> 00:48:44,260
structure because in a sense each of
these strategies is this whole structure

778
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:47,380
in a smaller sense.
So you could say this structure is

779
00:48:47,381 --> 00:48:51,250
composed of smaller units like this all
the way down and I don't know how far

780
00:48:51,251 --> 00:48:55,090
down I'm being able to figure that out,
but like because every goal can be

781
00:48:55,091 --> 00:48:59,800
conceptualized as viewed of sub goals
that have the same notion for for the

782
00:48:59,801 --> 00:49:01,390
purposes of the present discussion.

783
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:04,360
This is a sufficient sufficient
representation,

784
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,160
but that's something will that specific
issue we'll talk about more in the

785
00:49:09,161 --> 00:49:14,161
latter part of the latter part of the
course because the fact that a story is

786
00:49:14,891 --> 00:49:19,030
made up of sub stories right down to the
lowest level of resolution has

787
00:49:19,031 --> 00:49:23,230
implications for all for certain forms
of mythological representations,

788
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:28,060
representations of trees actually
knowing and want to get into that at the

789
00:49:28,061 --> 00:49:30,870
moment.
So anyways,

790
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,240
that's the story you said.
I put up there the domain and

791
00:49:33,241 --> 00:49:35,580
constituent elements of the known what
you pay for,

792
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:37,270
kind of,
I don't want a title for our diagram

793
00:49:37,271 --> 00:49:38,950
like this,
but I would say that from the

794
00:49:38,951 --> 00:49:41,170
perspective of the regulation of
emotion,

795
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:44,670
a story about where you are and where
you'd like to get to and how are you

796
00:49:44,671 --> 00:49:46,660
going to do that?
That is what you know,

797
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:49,330
just remember,
we're not in the domain of facts here

798
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,910
construed from the scientific
perspective.

799
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:55,600
We're in the domain of wisdom,
behavioral knowledge and what you know

800
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:58,150
is where you are,
where you want to be,

801
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,710
and theoretically how to get there.

802
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:05,530
So
I'll explain this in some more detail

803
00:50:05,531 --> 00:50:09,430
later.
Yeah.

804
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,513
Oh sure.
I'm,

805
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,880
yeah.
Okay.

806
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:20,200
So I said the first thing we're going to
do,

807
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,400
it's described in some detail how the
brain works and I want to do that

808
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:33,710
because I want to give you some insight
into how it is that we processed the

809
00:50:33,711 --> 00:50:36,620
multiple information and you need to
know,

810
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,920
and we think in stories before you can
actually understand how it is that we

811
00:50:39,921 --> 00:50:44,240
processing emotional information.
So I'm going to put up a somewhat

812
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:48,350
complicated diagram.
Your number basically that it will take

813
00:50:48,351 --> 00:50:51,610
three weeks to discuss this case
briefing,

814
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,370
but here's,
here's the ideal.

815
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,630
It's not as complicated as it looks.
Okay?

816
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:01,940
At the top,
well this is a circle but and you can

817
00:51:01,941 --> 00:51:04,850
start anywhere in a circle,
but we'll start at the top is how you

818
00:51:04,851 --> 00:51:08,900
process information.
Obviously the bottom line is if you have

819
00:51:08,901 --> 00:51:09,810
a certain road,
Spencer,

820
00:51:09,811 --> 00:51:10,644
again,

821
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:12,083
okay.

822
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:21,010
That seems where you input is
interpreted with regards to a

823
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:26,011
significance as a consequence of its
interaction with what you already know,

824
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:29,270
which is basically to say that your
presence,

825
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:33,680
which is which constitutes the sensory
information you ready for you to Tim

826
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:38,700
pinching on you at this moment is not a
vertical picture of the external world,

827
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,740
but your interpretation of reality as
it's unfolding.

828
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:45,370
And I'm not saying I'm not trying to
make a point that there no such thing as

829
00:51:45,371 --> 00:51:48,760
an external reality or that you living
in a delusion or any of those things,

830
00:51:48,761 --> 00:51:52,870
just that you're always interpreting
what's going on in relationship to its

831
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:56,810
significance to you and you have models,
some models.

832
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:59,440
Then you're doing that.
You have theories about what someone's

833
00:51:59,441 --> 00:52:01,390
like,
what you're like and what the situation

834
00:52:01,391 --> 00:52:03,150
consists of,
what you should be doing next.

835
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,500
If all of the input did you have with
prostitutes,

836
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:08,280
your online experience is a function of
your interpretation.

837
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,260
It's based on actual information,
but it's still a function of

838
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:12,940
interpretations.
Okay,

839
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:14,650
let's,
we'll use your declarative memory.

840
00:52:14,651 --> 00:52:18,280
That's one form of memory storage to
construct your version of the present.

841
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,990
That's the significance of things as
they're unfolding at the present time,

842
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:28,060
and you can only really,
you can only really make judgments about

843
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:32,440
the significance of things by contrast
with what you would like to happen.

844
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:36,040
That's your image of them.
Have the desired future.

845
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,930
Okay?
If you're,

846
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,530
if you're doing something this evening,
it's a very simple,

847
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,720
well,
let me give you an example.

848
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:53,220
There are experiments where people's
task is to pick up an object and you

849
00:52:54,551 --> 00:52:56,860
could see the object in front of them.
Okay,

850
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:59,140
so you're giving the tasks.
That's the basic story.

851
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:04,560
The story is what you're required to do
is to transform yourself from the person

852
00:53:05,171 --> 00:53:09,910
you are now into the person who has
possession of the watch.

853
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:11,890
It's just the standard laboratory
experiment,

854
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:17,140
but the watch is actually there.
It's an image that's generated by

855
00:53:17,141 --> 00:53:19,810
mirrors and when you move towards the
watch,

856
00:53:19,811 --> 00:53:21,850
you find that it's not where it appears
to be.

857
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:26,820
Well,
the fact of object not being where it

858
00:53:26,821 --> 00:53:31,821
appears to be is an anomaly with regards
to your current plan and you'll react to

859
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:35,070
that emotional.
The first thing that'll happen is that

860
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:37,710
obviously you're going to be surprised,
right?

861
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,650
You think this is pretty easy.
I'm going to pick that up and you find

862
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:42,960
out that the thing that you see is no,
it actually there.

863
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:47,850
That's an anomaly you contrast and your
desired future,

864
00:53:47,851 --> 00:53:52,350
which was your aim when you moved your
arm with the actual outcome of your

865
00:53:52,351 --> 00:53:53,184
actions.

866
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,720
That's a mismatch.
So part of your brain called the

867
00:53:57,721 --> 00:54:02,721
hippocampus that seems to be responsible
for comparing what's actually going on

868
00:54:03,961 --> 00:54:08,160
in so far as you can interpret that with
what you want to happen and if,

869
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:12,810
if a mismatch occurs,
that sets up a whole sequence of related

870
00:54:12,811 --> 00:54:17,790
events and those events manifest
themselves in emotion and in thought and

871
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:22,140
in behavior most evidently and emotion.
If you're going to do something,

872
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:25,710
you've done it before and it doesn't
work out the way you expected it to.

873
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:30,240
The events that constitute the anomaly,
the unexpected occurrence there are

874
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,970
surprising.
And the question then is what does

875
00:54:32,971 --> 00:54:34,680
surprising me?
Well,

876
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,280
it basically means that
something threatening as occurred and

877
00:54:40,681 --> 00:54:44,680
something,
something that moon is taking place.

878
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:46,350
And what does the unknown mean?
Well,

879
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,900
the thing about the unknown is that you
don't know what it means.

880
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,660
It's pretty,
it's a pretty straightforward statement,

881
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:53,850
but you see that immediately.

882
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,920
That immediately introduces this strange
sort of paradox because you lacked

883
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,190
infinite information.
Obviously people don't know what they're

884
00:55:02,191 --> 00:55:04,710
doing all the time,
which means that you come into contact

885
00:55:04,711 --> 00:55:06,450
with things that you'd want to
understand the law.

886
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:11,520
And that means in the sense that you
have to know what to do when you don't

887
00:55:11,521 --> 00:55:15,990
know what to do because you don't know
what to do a lot and that just doesn't

888
00:55:15,991 --> 00:55:20,130
just bring into a hall.
What is the case that your nervous

889
00:55:20,131 --> 00:55:25,131
system is hardwired to move to a sort of
default position when the plans that the

890
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:28,410
explicit plan is that you have,
that you're carrying out fail.

891
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:31,830
So as long as you could say in a sense,
as long as you know what you're doing,

892
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:35,280
which means that you have a
representation of where you are and

893
00:55:35,281 --> 00:55:38,040
where you'd like to be,
you're carrying out your plans to make

894
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:40,680
the move and things are going according
to plan.

895
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:44,640
As long as you're doing that,
then the higher centers in your,

896
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:47,460
of your brain and the cortex basically
it's under control.

897
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:51,240
You know what you're doing.
If you feel comfortable and secure as

898
00:55:51,241 --> 00:55:55,830
soon as something unexpected happens,
the control shifts and this is something

899
00:55:55,831 --> 00:55:58,960
that basically beyond your capacity to
control,

900
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:03,360
well you can interfere with the process
control shifts from the cortical centers

901
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:05,250
to the more fundamental areas of the
brain.

902
00:56:05,251 --> 00:56:08,430
To the limbic system.
When something unexpected happens,

903
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:09,870
two things,
Bowker,

904
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,110
you stop,
you'll feel a little bit of anxiety and

905
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:16,290
it's not unexpected you occurrences,
it's really unexpected.

906
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:18,780
You will be very,
very frightened because just minor

907
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,310
something,
minor league,

908
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:22,020
unexpected.
He'll just stop.

909
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:27,160
Your sensory processing will heighten,
you'll gather more information and

910
00:56:27,161 --> 00:56:30,940
you'll explore and as you explore the
generate information and the information

911
00:56:30,941 --> 00:56:32,890
is supposed to bring me back on course
basically.

912
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:37,890
So you'll say
what you'll do if you're trying to reach

913
00:56:37,931 --> 00:56:40,680
for the watch and you can find out that
it isn't where you taking this call,

914
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:44,230
you'll start making different sorts of
approach sequences until you end up

915
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,210
producing.
Now tell me that you intended

916
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,230
when something unexpected occurs,
two sets of circuitry,

917
00:56:51,231 --> 00:56:53,770
you're activated.
One looks like it's dominated by the

918
00:56:53,771 --> 00:56:56,320
right hand to secure the other.
It looks like it's dominated by the left

919
00:56:56,321 --> 00:57:00,760
hemisphere.
Unexpected things make you anxious and

920
00:57:00,761 --> 00:57:04,810
curious and you've been localize those
emotions in the body,

921
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:08,590
so to speak.
Anxiety is the emotion that a company is

922
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:13,570
the cessation of your body's plan
directed activities.

923
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,750
Okay?
That's you could say that anxiety is

924
00:57:16,751 --> 00:57:18,670
what you feel when you slipped into the
motive.

925
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,040
Pause,
pause for further analysis.

926
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:23,890
What do you expect it to do?
Give you a copy so you have to stop.

927
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,960
Curiosity is what you feel when it's
necessary for you to explore further,

928
00:57:28,961 --> 00:57:33,040
to gather new information,
to update your plans and exploration is

929
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:36,180
basically governed by the interplay of
the circuitry brain circuitry that

930
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:39,220
mediates anxiety and curiosity.
Curiosity,

931
00:57:39,221 --> 00:57:41,020
by the way,
now it's associated with positive

932
00:57:41,021 --> 00:57:43,450
emotions and anxiety.
As you all know.

933
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,630
Those associated with to negative people
shooting people would rather do I

934
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:48,670
experience it.
Curiosity of course.

935
00:57:48,671 --> 00:57:53,200
Surprise is basically a juxtaposition of
those two sets of emotions which work

936
00:57:53,201 --> 00:57:56,590
antagonistically.
The unknown produces coin flipped all by

937
00:57:56,591 --> 00:57:57,650
itself.
That's thick.

938
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:01,420
It's in a sense,
it's kind of early to introduce this,

939
00:58:01,421 --> 00:58:06,421
but that's the central theme in a way of
the whole course is that you have a hard

940
00:58:07,721 --> 00:58:11,130
wired response to the emergence of the
unexpected.

941
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,730
You have to because they have to know
what to do with something unexpected

942
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,310
trip.
It's instinct.

943
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:17,830
Your instinct of response to the
unknown.

944
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:22,990
Anxiety plus curiosity,
which is to say cessation of ongoing

945
00:58:22,991 --> 00:58:27,220
motor activity plus a drive to move
forward and explore and your exploratory

946
00:58:27,221 --> 00:58:29,950
activities.
Actually the sum total of the activation

947
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:34,510
of the two sets of circuitry that
mediate that response and when you

948
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,070
explore,
if you explore,

949
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:38,380
if something unexpected happens,
you don't have to explore,

950
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,420
you can note it and get the hell out of
there.

951
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:43,240
It's safe,
but you don't get them any new

952
00:58:43,241 --> 00:58:45,460
information.
It's a good short term strategy.

953
00:58:45,461 --> 00:58:47,410
It's not a good long term strategy,
but anyways,

954
00:58:47,411 --> 00:58:49,720
the point is,
is that surprise,

955
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:53,860
it's curiosity and it tells you 40
generate new information,

956
00:58:53,861 --> 00:58:56,070
you update your plan,
and as soon you can get to her,

957
00:58:56,090 --> 00:59:01,090
you want to go.
The point is the mismatch between what

958
00:59:01,331 --> 00:59:03,460
you expect to happen and what actually
happens.

959
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:05,370
That disc inhibits thing side.

960
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,453
Yeah.

961
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:16,340
If mismatch occurs,
there's a little sub organ in your brain

962
00:59:16,341 --> 00:59:20,390
called the Amygdala and you made,
it looks like it's responsible for the

963
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:23,720
addition of emotion to sensory
experience.

964
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:27,560
Yeah.
Behavioral psychologists have presumed

965
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:31,850
in the past,
most psychologists presume particularly

966
00:59:31,851 --> 00:59:36,851
behaviors that you learned to be afraid.
Newer models of the neuropsychology of

967
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,770
volition reversed that precept position
and say,

968
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:46,010
no.
You know how to be afraid.

969
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:49,730
Anything that you don't expect makes you
afraid.

970
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:54,410
That's your default position.
What you have to learn is how to be

971
00:59:54,411 --> 00:59:56,100
secure.
Now,

972
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:59,120
by the time you're an adult,
you've learned how to be secure so well

973
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,630
under most circumstances,
under secure circumstances,

974
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:06,110
you've learned how to be secure so well.
Then you don't realize that you're a

975
01:00:06,111 --> 01:00:09,320
priority or default position is fear.
You're coming,

976
01:00:09,321 --> 01:00:12,620
you're so well inculturated,
assuming you're successful.

977
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:18,290
That's the true nature of your emotional
responses in is in a sense hidden from

978
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:20,840
you,
which is precisely as it's supposed to

979
01:00:20,841 --> 01:00:22,910
be because the whole purpose of
socialization,

980
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:27,680
the whole purpose of learning is in fact
to shut off the circuitry that says

981
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:31,040
something of indeterminant significance
is occurring now.

982
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:32,570
People do not like it,
will not.

983
01:00:32,571 --> 01:00:34,390
Certain three is accurate,
don't not,

984
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:39,430
not it.
That's a fit in the air because people

985
01:00:39,771 --> 01:00:42,500
like to explore.
You're like novelty in small doses,

986
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:45,290
small controllable doses.
It's like food.

987
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:49,760
It's when something truly unexpected
occurs that up roots or upsets your

988
01:00:49,761 --> 01:00:51,950
plans,
that anxiety really becomes

989
01:00:51,951 --> 01:00:54,080
disinhibited.
People like that less than anything

990
01:00:54,081 --> 01:00:54,914
else.

991
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:00,530
Anyways,
the Amygdala labels things that are

992
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,950
unexpected as simultaneous,
that threatening and promised,

993
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:05,690
that basically puts you into an
approach.

994
01:01:05,691 --> 01:01:10,691
Avoidance conflict.
So what does that mean?

995
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:16,910
It means that anything unpredictable is
not neutral.

996
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:22,870
Anything unpredictable was frightened
that that in and of itself immediately

997
01:01:23,751 --> 01:01:28,751
she has a certain amount of life of why
is that we're somewhat low to accept

998
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:35,170
people whose behaviors we can't predict
it as one of us people who are from a

999
01:01:35,271 --> 01:01:37,400
culture that's different from ours for
example,

1000
01:01:37,401 --> 01:01:41,270
who have a story about how things should
go that runs differently from ours.

1001
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:44,900
Their behavior cannot be predicted with
certainty and you,

1002
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:48,020
you're,
you are instinctively wired so to speak,

1003
01:01:48,021 --> 01:01:51,250
to label unpredictable behavior as
threatened.

1004
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:54,770
And I think you can think about this in
really concrete terms and you can

1005
01:01:54,771 --> 01:01:57,590
experience this sort of thing regularly.
For example,

1006
01:01:57,591 --> 01:02:01,150
on a stroll through Harvard Yard in
north.

1007
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:05,000
Like if you look around you,
you're all decked out in symbols.

1008
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:09,380
So does that indicate here a particular
status?

1009
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:12,950
And Gold direct nature in a community
such as this,

1010
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:16,280
you're all relatively well dressed,
you're all relatively,

1011
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:17,451
no,
no,

1012
01:02:17,451 --> 01:02:19,210
it's all it's intended.
Um,

1013
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:23,400
you're all weld grew,
you're a tentative and your behavior is

1014
01:02:23,401 --> 01:02:25,590
very much indistinguishable from one
another.

1015
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,930
They're all participating in the same
sort of ritual.

1016
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,480
And then there's,
there's no reason for you to view your

1017
01:02:30,481 --> 01:02:33,780
neighbor's sitting beside you with any
degree of suspicion because you're

1018
01:02:33,781 --> 01:02:36,510
convinced that you can predict them.
But if you take a walk through somewhere

1019
01:02:36,511 --> 01:02:38,730
like Harvard Square,
where there are people who in a sense

1020
01:02:38,731 --> 01:02:41,550
fallen out of the culture.
So there are people there who were

1021
01:02:41,551 --> 01:02:43,290
mentally ill,
some of them are schizophrenia,

1022
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,080
many other miracle holic or homeless for
one reason or another.

1023
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:47,940
They're hard on your guilt if nothing
else,

1024
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,590
but they're also unpredictable.

1025
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:53,160
And you find that people do standard
things in the face of unpredictable.

1026
01:02:53,161 --> 01:02:54,720
Others,
they tend to avoid them,

1027
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,420
walk around them,
or at least to feel very uncomfortable

1028
01:02:57,421 --> 01:03:00,030
in your presence.
And that's because you do not know what

1029
01:03:00,031 --> 01:03:04,980
to do in the face of someone who's story
you cannot easily determine.

1030
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,170
You don't know what they're like.
You don't know if they're going to hurt

1031
01:03:07,171 --> 01:03:07,951
you.
You don't know if they're,

1032
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:08,940
um,
if they're,

1033
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,440
if they're dangerous.
In some regards,

1034
01:03:10,441 --> 01:03:12,900
you don't know what your obligations are
with regards to them.

1035
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:15,720
They're already labeled as part of the
unknown,

1036
01:03:15,721 --> 01:03:18,210
so to speak,
and you'll give them a relatively wide

1037
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,044
berth.

1038
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:25,403
Okay?

1039
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:31,390
The only message that that's really
necessary from this particular slide,

1040
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,220
you're always contrast what you want to
happen with what you think is that

1041
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:40,980
they're both more and wherever there's a
deviation,

1042
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,090
wherever what you want to happen isn't
going on,

1043
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:49,080
then you feel anxiety,
curiosity as well here impelled to

1044
01:03:49,081 --> 01:03:51,540
explore.
But anxiety is the thing that comes up

1045
01:03:51,541 --> 01:03:52,860
first.
And the larger,

1046
01:03:52,861 --> 01:03:55,410
the magnitude of the unexpected
occurrence,

1047
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,530
the greater the amount of anxiety.
One of the things we're going to try to

1048
01:03:58,531 --> 01:04:02,670
determine in the courses,
how you can understand how large a

1049
01:04:02,671 --> 01:04:06,270
disruption a given unexpected event is.
Because,

1050
01:04:06,271 --> 01:04:07,710
you know,
minor thing,

1051
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:10,220
let's go back to the southern diner for
a second.

1052
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,680
Here's a,
here's a way of looking at it.

1053
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,810
So let's say you're,
you know,

1054
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:20,400
you're going somewhere,
you have three plans to get there and

1055
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:23,370
this one doesn't work.
So that means it produces an outcome

1056
01:04:23,371 --> 01:04:26,400
that isn't what you envisioned and this
plan doesn't work.

1057
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:29,880
It produces a anomalous outcomes as
well,

1058
01:04:29,881 --> 01:04:31,890
but that plan doesn't work well,
that's no problem.

1059
01:04:31,891 --> 01:04:33,660
And he knows are pretty minor league
disruptions.

1060
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:38,340
All you do is you keep the same vision
of yourself and the same vision of the

1061
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:40,740
future.
You just switched between plants and

1062
01:04:40,741 --> 01:04:45,741
you're really in trouble if none of your
plans work or if someone messes around

1063
01:04:47,191 --> 01:04:50,490
with your representation of this or
this.

1064
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:56,690
So you can say for example,
you want to get into medical school and

1065
01:04:57,001 --> 01:05:01,230
you need 30 courses to get into medical
school and you should have a's on all of

1066
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:06,090
them and you get a b plus on one course.
Okay,

1067
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:07,680
well you still have all these other
courses.

1068
01:05:07,681 --> 01:05:10,170
That's not such a big deal.
It's a minor league disruption that

1069
01:05:10,171 --> 01:05:13,350
causes you a certain amount of anxiety
and produces a certain amount of

1070
01:05:13,351 --> 01:05:15,570
exploratory behavior.
Perhaps might go to the professor and

1071
01:05:15,571 --> 01:05:17,810
say,
why is it that I got this last one?

1072
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:20,550
I was expecting a name.
Don't you know what that's going to do

1073
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:24,070
that by positioning of the ideal future
and so on and so forth.

1074
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,440
That's,
that's one sort of disruption.

1075
01:05:26,441 --> 01:05:27,520
You're a bit anxious,
but hey,

1076
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:29,830
you have 29 other courses,
it's not such a big deal.

1077
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:35,040
Now instead write damn cap and You score
in the 50th percentile.

1078
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:39,670
Well now you're in trouble because you
have a vision of yourself.

1079
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,160
You think this is your version of the
unbearable present.

1080
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:44,410
You know,
a doctor that's a pain in the neck,

1081
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:47,740
but you're a potential doctor.
You have the intellectual resources at

1082
01:05:47,741 --> 01:05:50,710
your disposal and the educational
background and,

1083
01:05:50,711 --> 01:05:52,450
and,
and the familial,

1084
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:57,690
uh,
push perhaps to make you into a doctor.

1085
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:00,490
And so that's what you've conceived
yourself as.

1086
01:06:00,491 --> 01:06:02,050
That's your story about yourself cause
you're the,

1087
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:04,570
this person with this set number of
potentials.

1088
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:07,030
And you also have the visual of where it
is that you're going,

1089
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,920
oh,
am cat score comes back and you're in

1090
01:06:08,921 --> 01:06:09,970
the 15th percentile.

1091
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:13,960
Well your,
your ideal future is gone.

1092
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:19,890
That's a big problem because that means
that all of the events that have

1093
01:06:19,961 --> 01:06:24,961
surrounded you and surround you now and
as far back as you can remember that

1094
01:06:25,271 --> 01:06:30,271
were given determinant significance by
this particular plan have all been cast

1095
01:06:30,281 --> 01:06:33,580
into chaos.
Everything that you've done up to that

1096
01:06:33,581 --> 01:06:36,490
point has been predicated on the notion
that this is where you were going and

1097
01:06:36,491 --> 01:06:40,240
that means that the significance that
you attributed to everything was

1098
01:06:40,241 --> 01:06:43,420
attributed to everything in relationship
to that goal.

1099
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:47,290
You blow out the goal and all those
significance or backup in the air.

1100
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:49,460
We have to modify your version of
yourself.

1101
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:52,840
Why the hell are you going to do now
they going to be a doctor,

1102
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:55,960
but a lot of work into this.
Plus it's your whole self conception.

1103
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:57,250
Well,
this is gone.

1104
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:00,460
This is gone.
I mean this is irrelevant,

1105
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,140
right?
I mean the other 29 courses,

1106
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,120
why the hell are you even here now?

1107
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:11,250
That's one example of the levels at
which anomalies can incur minor league

1108
01:07:11,681 --> 01:07:12,700
anomalies.
No problem.

1109
01:07:12,701 --> 01:07:14,710
You just scoot around them and you go to
the same place,

1110
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:19,180
major league anomalies.
It's a new ideal future.

1111
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:22,810
That's part of the reason that people
are so prone to ideological conflicts.

1112
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:28,190
It's like this is an ideology.
You could say it has a particular

1113
01:07:28,481 --> 01:07:30,780
version of the way things are.
Knowing a little bit communist ideology

1114
01:07:30,781 --> 01:07:32,950
is pretty,
it's pretty explicit.

1115
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:35,440
What's the unbearable present,
so to speak?

1116
01:07:35,441 --> 01:07:37,750
Well,
I know this is a bit dated,

1117
01:07:37,751 --> 01:07:40,610
but we're running out of the hardline
etiologies to co fund,

1118
01:07:41,060 --> 01:07:43,030
so I have to use an old one.
But um,

1119
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,380
the unbearable present is the class
struggle and we have reasons for that.

1120
01:07:47,381 --> 01:07:50,110
It's basically the fault of the rich who
are exploiting the poor.

1121
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:55,560
The ideal future is the point at which
those unfair divisions of capital are

1122
01:07:55,751 --> 01:07:56,530
eliminated them.

1123
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:58,120
There's a whole bunch of means to that
end.

1124
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,830
That's,
that's an ideology.

1125
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,750
Well,
someone else has a different ideology,

1126
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:04,690
different version of the significance of
current events,

1127
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:09,310
a different version of the significance
and the nature of the ideal future and

1128
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:12,130
they completely different apprehension
of how to transform one or the other.

1129
01:08:12,131 --> 01:08:14,740
When those two cultures come into
contact,

1130
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:15,860
we'll how,
first of all,

1131
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:19,580
they made each other anxious because
they're not convinced.

1132
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,370
They don't have to answer and goals.
And if this is the structure that

1133
01:08:22,371 --> 01:08:24,770
regulates emotion,
well what's going to happen?

1134
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:28,580
Why don't you can't just give up your
damn plans because then your emotions

1135
01:08:28,581 --> 01:08:30,350
are dysregulated.
You fall into chaos,

1136
01:08:30,351 --> 01:08:31,990
so to speak.
You don't know where you are and you

1137
01:08:31,991 --> 01:08:34,760
don't know who you are.
You don't know what to do and you don't

1138
01:08:34,761 --> 01:08:37,250
know where you're going.
That makes you anxious.

1139
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:38,780
Neither side is going to give up.

1140
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:41,520
Give up their certainty.
Well,

1141
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:44,990
the only thing left and under what
circumstances is conflict and you see

1142
01:08:44,991 --> 01:08:46,580
this,
I mean look how do,

1143
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:50,360
how do arguments escalate and argue?
Argument with someone that you love.

1144
01:08:50,361 --> 01:08:52,910
Even if they want one thing,
you want another,

1145
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:56,460
you discuss it.
You're not getting anywhere you're

1146
01:08:56,461 --> 01:09:01,030
tempers raise because the abstract
discussion isn't helping find that you'd

1147
01:09:01,031 --> 01:09:04,550
give up.
Maybe you move to to violence to solve

1148
01:09:04,551 --> 01:09:06,410
your problem,
to hammer out the story,

1149
01:09:06,411 --> 01:09:07,550
so to speak.
You can do that,

1150
01:09:07,551 --> 01:09:11,420
but still oppressing the person who has
the different,

1151
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:13,230
a different import.

1152
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:20,770
So your brain is set up to contrast a
vision of what you would like with a

1153
01:09:21,231 --> 01:09:25,520
vision of what's occurring and when
something unexpected occurs and there's

1154
01:09:25,521 --> 01:09:28,730
a whole sequence that emotional
processes that are disinhibited,

1155
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:31,670
the May deal with the governors governs.
Then by all appearances.

1156
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:36,230
It's an extraordinarily ancient Oregon
works in concert with the hippocampus.

1157
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:39,570
They hit the campus by the way evolved
in the course of five.

1158
01:09:39,571 --> 01:09:42,200
The genesis basically what amphibians
left the ocean.

1159
01:09:42,201 --> 01:09:45,050
So we had this circuitry has been around
a long time,

1160
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:47,300
a lot longer than your higher cortical
centers.

1161
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:51,150
It's very sophisticated and it's very
powerful and I think you could say that

1162
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:56,390
we spend our whole lives trying to make
sure that the Amygdala is shut off so we

1163
01:09:57,021 --> 01:09:58,100
don't like it when it's on.
I mean,

1164
01:09:58,101 --> 01:09:59,450
maybe you can,
that's again,

1165
01:09:59,451 --> 01:10:03,530
that's not exactly true because I think
a tiny bit of activation under

1166
01:10:03,531 --> 01:10:05,840
controlled circumstances,
that's optimal,

1167
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:09,620
but there's a threshold and if,
and if differs to some degree from

1168
01:10:09,621 --> 01:10:11,930
person to person,
if you exceed that threshold,

1169
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:17,560
there's nothing that you dislike more
cause the [inaudible] to the thing that

1170
01:10:17,991 --> 01:10:21,200
says everything that you are is in
danger.

1171
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,860
We'd like to keep it shut off.
Most of the time it shut off as long as

1172
01:10:25,861 --> 01:10:28,130
we associate with people who are
predictable to us,

1173
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:31,670
as long as we know where we're going and
things that we predict our own current,

1174
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:35,480
it shuts up and the cortical centers are
in control and you know,

1175
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:37,010
we go down the path that we've chosen.

1176
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,560
Okay.
Now

1177
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,610
the other thing I'm interested in is

1178
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,010
good.
Say It as far as your brain's concerned.

1179
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:20,523
Yeah.

1180
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:23,020
Let me step one step back.
What's the emotion?

1181
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:29,610
Emotion is the subjective sensation that
you feel when you encounter a situation

1182
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:35,400
that has implications for action.
So emotion occupies the space between

1183
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:41,650
sensory input and motor.
So if you encounter something that has

1184
01:11:41,651 --> 01:11:44,860
significance,
you feel an emotion and an emotion is

1185
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:48,880
the subjective sense that it companies
the activation or the preoccupation of

1186
01:11:48,881 --> 01:11:51,250
motor output systems.
That's basically how it occurred.

1187
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:53,140
How it appears.
Say Well,

1188
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:56,603
okay,

1189
01:11:57,070 --> 01:12:01,150
you can think of the world the way that
we normally think of it as something

1190
01:12:01,151 --> 01:12:05,860
that exists objectively have something
that's amenable to scientific

1191
01:12:05,861 --> 01:12:10,030
description or you can also think of it
as a place that's full of things that

1192
01:12:10,031 --> 01:12:12,140
have implications for rashes.
Now

1193
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:19,260
as far as stories are concerned,
the university is a place that's full of

1194
01:12:19,301 --> 01:12:20,950
things that have implications for
action.

1195
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:24,160
That's the environment from the
narrative perspective.

1196
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:30,970
The most fundamental substructure of
narratives can be phoning myths and the

1197
01:12:30,971 --> 01:12:35,590
next thing I want to show you is how
miss fundamentally represent the world

1198
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:38,830
in so far as it's conceived of it as
something that has implication for

1199
01:12:38,831 --> 01:12:41,230
behavior,
something with emotional significance.

1200
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:43,750
So you decided the world of the
scientific object,

1201
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:46,600
so to speak,
is devoid of emotional significance

1202
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:50,470
really by design.
Part of what you do in the scientific

1203
01:12:50,471 --> 01:12:53,620
procedure is eradicate anything that's
purely subjective,

1204
01:12:53,621 --> 01:12:54,454
like emotion.

1205
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:59,130
If you think a theory is true because
you liked the theory that snoring

1206
01:12:59,150 --> 01:13:02,320
sufficient grounds for considering a
true from the scientific perspective,

1207
01:13:02,321 --> 01:13:04,600
you're supposed to make yourself on
objective,

1208
01:13:04,601 --> 01:13:09,040
which basically means to eradicate your
emotional assessment of the,

1209
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:11,170
of,
of a given situation.

1210
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:14,260
But the thing is we're always assessing
situations for their athletic.

1211
01:13:14,261 --> 01:13:17,380
That significance.
We have to do that because emotion

1212
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:20,170
around affect needs how to act,
and you always have to figure out how to

1213
01:13:20,171 --> 01:13:23,500
act in every situation,
so it's reasonable to construe the

1214
01:13:23,501 --> 01:13:25,870
world.
That's something that has meaning as a

1215
01:13:25,871 --> 01:13:30,871
place where that meaning exists.
This is how the world is conceived of

1216
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:35,110
from the mythological perspective.

1217
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:38,253
Okay.

1218
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:46,330
It's quite straight forward.
I'm not going to talk much about this.

1219
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:54,520
Mythological representation of chaos is
just the attempt to represent the place

1220
01:13:54,521 --> 01:13:57,280
that everything comes from before
there's any divisions between any,

1221
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:02,050
I didn't want to get into that right now
from the mythological perspective.

1222
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:04,430
This is,
this is how the world,

1223
01:14:06,490 --> 01:14:11,490
this is a creation myth.
Basically you're Rachel things into two

1224
01:14:11,921 --> 01:14:15,940
components,
one of which is the unknown and the

1225
01:14:15,941 --> 01:14:18,250
other,
which is the known.

1226
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:22,990
Now the no one has this structure.
It's a story is if you know something,

1227
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:25,730
you know the story that goes along with
which means that if you know,

1228
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:29,460
if you know a territory,
if you explore the territory,

1229
01:14:29,461 --> 01:14:31,180
I mean as you know how to act,
then that's all.

1230
01:14:31,181 --> 01:14:35,620
That's all that I'm trying to emphasize
here and myth.

1231
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:40,780
From the mythological perspective,
the world is constructed of three

1232
01:14:40,781 --> 01:14:43,930
things.
One is all those things that you don't

1233
01:14:43,931 --> 01:14:48,280
know as the domain of that unpredictable
and it has a primary motivational

1234
01:14:48,281 --> 01:14:49,114
significance.

1235
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:50,410
It's basically,
it means that Oh,

1236
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:52,750
first dawn attack,
it scares the hell out of you and then

1237
01:14:52,751 --> 01:14:54,760
it makes you curious.
If you stick around long enough.

1238
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:58,540
First face it reveals is the one that
makes you anxious.

1239
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:03,040
That's unexplored territory.
That's the the dark forest,

1240
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:04,870
barbarian lands,
dark water,

1241
01:15:04,871 --> 01:15:09,871
the land of the dead tie math as well.
[inaudible] the dragon from Mesopotamian

1242
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:12,130
creation myth from which everything
comes.

1243
01:15:12,131 --> 01:15:15,160
Basically
anything frankly,

1244
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:18,310
anything threatening,
anything that makes you run away,

1245
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:22,060
anything that's in the dark,
anything that's unfamiliar,

1246
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,880
I don't know what constitutes the
unknown from the mythological

1247
01:15:24,881 --> 01:15:26,410
perspective,
that's half the world.

1248
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:30,040
It's a division between chaos and order.
Basically from the mythological

1249
01:15:30,041 --> 01:15:31,930
perspective,
that's what the universe is composed of.

1250
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:36,160
Chaos is divided for mortar and that's
the world you live in order.

1251
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:40,240
Hopefully chaos surrounds you like a,
like in the ocean surrounds an island.

1252
01:15:40,241 --> 01:15:42,670
Fundamentally.
That's what this diagram is basically

1253
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:47,110
trying to represent the known a great
father.

1254
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:50,110
That's culture,
the village,

1255
01:15:50,111 --> 01:15:52,450
the nation explored territory,
the city,

1256
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,250
the family,
the king,

1257
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:56,860
the predictable.
That's where you live.

1258
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:00,370
That's where everything is being
transformed from chaos into order where

1259
01:16:00,371 --> 01:16:04,300
everything can be predicted and it sits
on top of the unknown.

1260
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:21,880
Psychoanalytic interpretations of
the rationale for social conflict,

1261
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:27,970
often positive that what you see in
people who you are willing to persecute

1262
01:16:29,421 --> 01:16:31,010
his,
your own dark side.

1263
01:16:31,011 --> 01:16:33,590
Those things above you that you're most
unwilling to admit.

1264
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:37,520
I think there's a certain amount of
truth in that,

1265
01:16:37,521 --> 01:16:41,720
but what's more accurate and more
fundamental and much less difficult to

1266
01:16:41,721 --> 01:16:46,721
understand in a sense is that
if someone is not familiar to you,

1267
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:54,110
you don't have to presume anything about
the mere fact of their existence as

1268
01:16:54,111 --> 01:16:57,830
something unfamiliar.
It's already sufficient to give them a

1269
01:16:57,831 --> 01:17:01,420
certain emotional valence and that
emotional valence,

1270
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:06,140
at least on initial contact is the
promotion of anxiety.

1271
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:10,010
Don't.
You don't

1272
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:15,010
have to think in some ways about the
necessity of projection or your unreal

1273
01:17:15,790 --> 01:17:16,800
are you're,
you're,

1274
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:20,810
you're only incomprehensibility to
yourself or your propensity did until we

1275
01:17:20,811 --> 01:17:25,040
see the evil and others is the mere fact
of unpredictabilities enough to render

1276
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:29,360
someone associated with this domain that
makes the thing

1277
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:35,050
I said we classify things in two
different plays in a sense what caused

1278
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:37,130
to buy things from the scientific
perspective,

1279
01:17:37,131 --> 01:17:40,850
but we also classify them from the
perspective of their significance for

1280
01:17:40,851 --> 01:17:45,851
action and you could say that a natural
category is the class of all things that

1281
01:17:46,491 --> 01:17:50,510
you should run away from and from the
perspective of that sort of

1282
01:17:50,511 --> 01:17:53,930
classification,
everything that is the sort of thing

1283
01:17:53,931 --> 01:17:56,180
that you should run away from is the
same thing.

1284
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:59,750
So that means anytime you,
you encounter something that's

1285
01:17:59,751 --> 01:18:04,280
unpredictable,
it's that thing is instantly thrown into

1286
01:18:04,281 --> 01:18:06,470
the category of all the things that I've
ever frightened you,

1287
01:18:06,471 --> 01:18:10,520
all the things in your life that you
haven't been able to control because the

1288
01:18:10,521 --> 01:18:14,390
idea of the thing that you should run
away from is one of the most fundamental

1289
01:18:14,391 --> 01:18:15,740
types of classification.

1290
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:18,830
The ribs just,
we're always classifying things in terms

1291
01:18:18,831 --> 01:18:20,990
of fundamental significance for
behavior.

1292
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:25,070
I found out for example,
I'd thought about that,

1293
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:28,420
I guess about six or seven years ago,
I was reading missy Elliot.

1294
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:30,260
There are many creative,
many creation.

1295
01:18:30,261 --> 01:18:33,170
There's the world comes out of the body
of a drag.

1296
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:35,150
For example,
in the Mesopotamian creation myth,

1297
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:39,380
marvel versus timeout.
Timeout is a dragon who lives at the

1298
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:43,070
bottom of the ocean and she's the mother
of all the gods,

1299
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:45,950
but they make a lot of noise and
irritate your and it also killed her

1300
01:18:45,951 --> 01:18:47,610
husband.
This makes it quite mad,

1301
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:51,860
so she decided she's going to eat them
all and one of the medicine it can go up

1302
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:56,120
to the Martech
is elected by.

1303
01:18:56,121 --> 01:18:58,070
The other goal is to go and fight with
time.

1304
01:18:58,071 --> 01:19:02,160
Map him down.
He encloses her in a Gnat and cuts or

1305
01:19:02,161 --> 01:19:02,750
into pieces.

1306
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:06,470
None of the pieces he makes the world.
He creates

1307
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:11,600
order from chaos.
He's the third feature of the

1308
01:19:11,601 --> 01:19:15,770
mythological world.
There's the unknown and there's the no,

1309
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:19,190
and there's process that mediates
between turns.

1310
01:19:19,191 --> 01:19:21,620
One backs the hero,
the hero.

1311
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:26,540
He turns up the dragon and makes the
world so he's assimilated to a creator.

1312
01:19:26,541 --> 01:19:27,374
God.
Basically.

1313
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:30,440
The reason I'm telling you the story now
of always because I found out from

1314
01:19:30,450 --> 01:19:32,680
Iliad,
but many archaic cultures,

1315
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:35,630
the Iranians and the Egyptians were
three others whose names I don't

1316
01:19:35,631 --> 01:19:39,500
remember a moment.
The symbol that they used for the

1317
01:19:39,501 --> 01:19:42,610
stranger,
the barbarian was the same symbol used

1318
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,010
to represent the chaos that predated the
construction of the world.

1319
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:48,080
So you can,
this is so interesting.

1320
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:51,890
If you'd grab the Chris Grasp the
significance of that because it meant

1321
01:19:51,891 --> 01:19:53,570
that Egyptian,
the ancient Egyptians,

1322
01:19:53,571 --> 01:19:55,190
for example,
who never let a foreigner into one of

1323
01:19:55,191 --> 01:19:58,790
their temples because the foreigner
would bring chaos into order.

1324
01:19:59,030 --> 01:20:02,030
The forerunner was chaos.
That's the thing for the Egyptian

1325
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:05,210
foreigner was chaos.
They use the same symbol.

1326
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:09,150
That's how people think that is.
We think it's like if you're not from

1327
01:20:09,151 --> 01:20:10,290
the same tribe,
however,

1328
01:20:10,291 --> 01:20:12,270
that's defined most,
most fundamentally,

1329
01:20:12,271 --> 01:20:15,120
it would be the family,
but obviously we've abstracted that up

1330
01:20:15,121 --> 01:20:17,220
into the nation.
We're into an ideological unit or

1331
01:20:17,221 --> 01:20:18,900
whatever.
If you're not us,

1332
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:23,790
then you are chaos and all by yourself.
Under those circumstances.

1333
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:26,400
If you're an agent of chaos,
you have emotional significance.

1334
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:29,610
Here's something I know I can't predict.
I'm afraid of things I can't predict.

1335
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:32,730
You're a threat to me.
Along the path from that to to

1336
01:20:32,731 --> 01:20:34,470
oppressing you is not very,
very,

1337
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:36,450
it's a very short one.

1338
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:41,660
Well,
one of the things we're going to study

1339
01:20:41,661 --> 01:20:45,720
to a fair degree is mythological
representations of the world hits.

1340
01:20:45,890 --> 01:20:49,880
I find this extremely interesting and
the reason for this is because as soon

1341
01:20:49,881 --> 01:20:53,450
as you know,
as soon as you know that we use stories

1342
01:20:53,451 --> 01:20:57,110
to regulate our emotions,
and as soon as you know that there are

1343
01:20:57,111 --> 01:20:59,120
two types of information that we need to
gather,

1344
01:20:59,121 --> 01:21:04,121
one be factual information and the other
information about how we should behave,

1345
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:10,120
then you have the possibility of reading
mythological accounts or stories in

1346
01:21:10,671 --> 01:21:13,820
general from a completely different
perspective because you don't have to

1347
01:21:13,821 --> 01:21:15,200
think anymore.
Well,

1348
01:21:15,890 --> 01:21:17,660
this mythological account,
for example,

1349
01:21:17,661 --> 01:21:21,230
with the creation of the world has no
relationship whatsoever to evolutionary

1350
01:21:21,231 --> 01:21:23,510
theory.
We know evolutionary theories more

1351
01:21:23,511 --> 01:21:26,130
accurate,
therefore this whole sequence,

1352
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:28,970
but accounts has to be cast into the
realm like pseudoscience of

1353
01:21:28,971 --> 01:21:31,340
superstition.
Well then you lose all the information

1354
01:21:31,341 --> 01:21:32,210
that's in those stories.

1355
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:35,360
As soon as you know that those stories
aren't concerned in the least with the

1356
01:21:35,361 --> 01:21:39,950
construction of the objective world,
but our concern with the world as it as

1357
01:21:39,951 --> 01:21:43,280
it has significance women,
you have a whole new way of approaching

1358
01:21:43,281 --> 01:21:47,060
the whole new mode of interpreting them
and you can start to understand the

1359
01:21:47,061 --> 01:21:51,290
nature of the stories that actually
underlie our culture and believe me,

1360
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:52,730
that's so,
that's so useful.

1361
01:21:53,210 --> 01:21:54,710
Well,
it's so useful.

1362
01:21:54,711 --> 01:21:56,570
You can hardly believe it.
Fine.

1363
01:21:56,571 --> 01:22:00,350
All of a sudden there's all these
stories that you've heard since the

1364
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:02,930
earliest days.
Stories that are basically rationally

1365
01:22:02,931 --> 01:22:05,090
and comprehensible.
As soon as you twist your

1366
01:22:05,091 --> 01:22:09,020
presuppositions about their origins,
just 45 degrees,

1367
01:22:09,021 --> 01:22:11,930
then you can see the order in the mini
exactly what it is that they're trying

1368
01:22:11,931 --> 01:22:15,680
to turn to put forth and they all of a
sudden made sense.

1369
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:18,200
Well,
I think knowing,

1370
01:22:18,201 --> 01:22:21,020
just regardless of its implications for
Social Poncelet,

1371
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:26,270
knowing that getting a key to the
meaning of the stories that's worth

1372
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:30,290
having to plow your way through all the
information that you have to read in

1373
01:22:30,291 --> 01:22:35,291
this course because you all Italian,
you'll go see if they can see movies and

1374
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:38,290
read novels and look at myths and we'll
think,

1375
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:39,590
oh,
I know what that means now,

1376
01:22:39,591 --> 01:22:39,950
isn't it?

1377
01:22:39,950 --> 01:22:41,990
Isn't it so interesting?
If that's what it means,

1378
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:45,680
you can immediately see that
relationship between the story and your

1379
01:22:45,681 --> 01:22:49,580
own and the position that you occupy in
the midst of things.

1380
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:54,970
It's very fascinating.
So we're interested in representation,

1381
01:22:56,741 --> 01:22:58,540
but right here,
I want to read you a bit of a story

1382
01:22:58,541 --> 01:22:59,374
here.

1383
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:06,010
So the unknown is the great,
terrible mother.

1384
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:07,360
Wow.
You know,

1385
01:23:07,361 --> 01:23:09,550
you're going to have to accept that,
my word for that at the moment.

1386
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:12,520
But the basic notion is a feminine
imagery.

1387
01:23:12,521 --> 01:23:15,460
10 is tends to be used to represent the
unknown.

1388
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:19,130
And the reason for that is because the
unknown is the mother of all things.

1389
01:23:19,131 --> 01:23:22,690
So that's obviously their mystical way
of thinking about it.

1390
01:23:22,691 --> 01:23:27,250
But all I've seen is this,
every bit of as far as math is

1391
01:23:27,251 --> 01:23:29,890
concerned,
information is the world.

1392
01:23:31,670 --> 01:23:34,990
That's the note.
All the information that you generate,

1393
01:23:35,170 --> 01:23:38,440
you generate in contact as a consequence
of your contact with something you

1394
01:23:38,441 --> 01:23:40,690
didn't understand,
which is only to say that you generate

1395
01:23:40,691 --> 01:23:42,790
information by exploring.
It's not hurting.

1396
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:48,460
That's obvious then it's not much of a
step from there to the construing the

1397
01:23:48,461 --> 01:23:52,450
thing that you're investigating,
which is the unknown as the source of

1398
01:23:52,451 --> 01:23:53,284
everything.

1399
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:57,820
Perfectly reasonable presupposition and
it's not such a difficult leap to make,

1400
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,110
to construe the source of everything as
something feminine thing,

1401
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:05,050
something that gives birth to things
anyways.

1402
01:24:05,490 --> 01:24:09,540
It doesn't matter if you follow that
train of logic or north or if you accept

1403
01:24:09,541 --> 01:24:12,640
that that isn't the case and that is how
miss tend to represent them.

1404
01:24:12,641 --> 01:24:13,740
No.
So uh,

1405
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:16,570
one of the books that you're going to
read is called the great mother and

1406
01:24:16,571 --> 01:24:18,640
that's how work by your new one and it
is.

1407
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:23,230
It's 300 pages of description of
mythological representations of the

1408
01:24:23,231 --> 01:24:24,820
feminine.
Anyways,

1409
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:28,240
that's the mythological aspect.
I want to read you a good story about

1410
01:24:28,241 --> 01:24:32,500
rats because I want to show you how
deeply grown with these sorts of notions

1411
01:24:32,501 --> 01:24:35,290
are.
I want to tell you a little story first

1412
01:24:35,291 --> 01:24:38,410
before I read this,
I was watching a bugs bunny cartoon the

1413
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:39,243
other day with my kids.

1414
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:42,550
And um,
you're probably more or less familiar

1415
01:24:42,551 --> 01:24:46,960
with the bugs bunny cartoon characters.
There's a sheep dog and a wolf and they

1416
01:24:46,961 --> 01:24:51,010
go to work in the morning and sheepdogs
job is to guard the sheep and the wolves

1417
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:52,660
job is to eat them and they punch the
time,

1418
01:24:52,661 --> 01:24:55,300
clock in and then they go into their
respective roles.

1419
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,430
Anyways,
the sheep dog is always beating,

1420
01:24:57,890 --> 01:25:00,220
whoa,
flop baggy and he gets the real rough

1421
01:25:00,221 --> 01:25:02,350
end of the stick.
Now there's one scene there,

1422
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:05,740
cause she'd be August,
sitting on a cliff watching the sheep

1423
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,540
and it's raining and the wolf gets a
bright idea,

1424
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:10,180
is going to put hair tonic on the sheet
goes,

1425
01:25:10,181 --> 01:25:11,290
hey,
okay.

1426
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,610
And it's raining so that the sheep dog,
well not as sweet,

1427
01:25:13,611 --> 01:25:18,611
sneaks up and the sheep Harriton and
hair grows down over his eyes right now.

1428
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:24,370
So the sheep dog sitting here and
they're wolf climbs up the cliff and the

1429
01:25:24,371 --> 01:25:28,270
first thing he does is he has a hand,
the glove on the stick.

1430
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,920
So he's hiding behind the cliff and it
puts the hand on his dick and he raised

1431
01:25:31,921 --> 01:25:35,020
it in front of the sheep dog space.
No one response.

1432
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:40,290
Now that wolf is exploring unexplored
territory and it does.

1433
01:25:40,691 --> 01:25:43,430
It cautiously sticks a stick on it.
Nothing happens.

1434
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:46,510
And so then the next thing it has is
just pokes his head up and goes right

1435
01:25:46,511 --> 01:25:48,470
down and it looks nothing terrible
happens.

1436
01:25:48,471 --> 01:25:52,290
And then it climbs up on top of the
cliff and it weighs this hand in hand.

1437
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:53,750
The sheep,
you are you starting to smile now?

1438
01:25:53,751 --> 01:25:56,030
I thinks it's pretty smart now it's
jumping up and down.

1439
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:58,830
Okay,
so it's explored the territory.

1440
01:25:58,831 --> 01:26:03,831
It's mapped it originally the unexplored
territory was anxiety provoking the wolf

1441
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:06,800
on your way to a whole sequence of
exploratory activities.

1442
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:08,390
Map The territory.
It's safe.

1443
01:26:08,391 --> 01:26:10,410
So then it's off to steal a sheep.
Okay,

1444
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:11,450
that's funny.

1445
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:15,350
That was funny because animators are
great at picking out what we do and

1446
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:17,030
exaggerating them.
So they're comical.

1447
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,460
That's exploring unknown territory.
Okay.

1448
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:23,300
Most of the time when behavioral
psychologist teach a rat to be afraid

1449
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:24,650
and that's what they think they're
doing,

1450
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:28,670
they take a route that's secure.
So they presumed that the natural state

1451
01:26:28,671 --> 01:26:31,150
of the rat is secure.
But the only bloody reason the rats

1452
01:26:31,151 --> 01:26:33,260
secure is because it's already explored
his cage.

1453
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:36,980
So you put a rat in a cage and they will
freeze because it's scared.

1454
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:41,300
And then if nothing terrible happens
soon it unfreezes and then it slowly

1455
01:26:41,301 --> 01:26:43,700
starts to explore it.
It might just move his eyes first and

1456
01:26:43,701 --> 01:26:46,900
sniff and then if not in terrible
happens and starts to move and as soon

1457
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:49,880
and checks out the whole cage.
And if nothing is in there that it's

1458
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:52,400
going to kill it,
it has a nap or whatever.

1459
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,820
Maybe it looks for some food,
but it asked to explore before it's

1460
01:26:55,821 --> 01:26:59,590
secure.
Now more modern animal psychologist need

1461
01:26:59,630 --> 01:27:01,010
fallen,
just sort of starting to study the

1462
01:27:01,011 --> 01:27:03,260
reactions of things like rats in their
natural habitat.

1463
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:05,990
And that's what this story is about.
So take a rabbit,

1464
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,900
wraps their social,
set them up in a Burl,

1465
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:12,260
and they let them set up.
There were only map out their territory

1466
01:27:12,261 --> 01:27:15,560
by exploring.
So they have this whole burl system set

1467
01:27:15,561 --> 01:27:17,010
up and the rats,
no,

1468
01:27:17,011 --> 01:27:18,470
it,
nothing's dangerous there,

1469
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:21,200
that's home,
but a caffeine,

1470
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:23,450
one section of it.
That's the story.

1471
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:26,810
When a cat is presented to an
established mixed sex group of

1472
01:27:26,811 --> 01:27:30,440
laboratory rats living in visible girl,
the behaviors of the subjects changed

1473
01:27:30,441 --> 01:27:33,470
dramatically in many cases for 24 hours
or more.

1474
01:27:33,950 --> 01:27:38,270
The initial act of defensive behavior
flight to the tunnel chamber system.

1475
01:27:38,271 --> 01:27:42,470
So the rats are cruising alone where
they think it's safe and there's a cat.

1476
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:45,020
Well,
it's like home into the borough

1477
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:50,450
is followed by a period of immobility
during which the rats make 22 kilohertz,

1478
01:27:50,451 --> 01:27:53,730
ultrasonic vocalization,
which apparently served as lawyer cries

1479
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:56,270
that I rate.
So there to put it,

1480
01:27:56,370 --> 01:28:00,260
uh,
they're freaked out and they brought it

1481
01:28:00,261 --> 01:28:04,370
home and screen the frozen and they
screen like they must be screaming

1482
01:28:04,371 --> 01:28:05,570
something like,
oh no,

1483
01:28:05,571 --> 01:28:07,820
there's a cat and all the other grads
here this,

1484
01:28:07,821 --> 01:28:09,440
and they're all in their girls.
They're terrifying.

1485
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:14,330
They're frozen into your mobility by the
appearance of this unexpected thing as

1486
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:16,300
freezing breaks up.
It's interesting.

1487
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,890
Think of a good myth.
This persons in the Gorgon

1488
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,640
show,
the face of the Gorgon was this female

1489
01:28:22,641 --> 01:28:23,720
head.
This covered the snakes.

1490
01:28:23,721 --> 01:28:27,830
That's a new image of the unknown.
That thing turns you to stone anyways,

1491
01:28:28,410 --> 01:28:31,700
as freezing breaks up.
Proxemic avoidance of the open area,

1492
01:28:31,701 --> 01:28:34,520
gravity diddly gives way to a pattern of
risk assessment of the area where the

1493
01:28:34,521 --> 01:28:35,354
cat was encountered.

1494
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:38,030
Okay,
so the rats are frozen and they think

1495
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:38,871
you know,
oh no,

1496
01:28:38,871 --> 01:28:41,600
death is around the corner.
They don't precisely think that,

1497
01:28:41,601 --> 01:28:44,330
but that's how they act and if nothing
happens,

1498
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:47,000
it's also terrible.
Well,

1499
01:28:47,090 --> 01:28:51,670
they start to relax a little bit and as
soon as they start to relax the circuit,

1500
01:28:51,671 --> 01:28:53,090
you're like,
they're very curious about this

1501
01:28:53,091 --> 01:28:55,430
unexpected occurrence,
but they're overwhelmed by anxiety.

1502
01:28:55,431 --> 01:28:58,070
They don't do any exploring.
They run back and make sure that nothing

1503
01:28:58,071 --> 01:29:01,010
terrible happens.
Just like that movie she could dog may

1504
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:03,680
run back and how's their anxiety?
Receipts.

1505
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,640
Okay.
Curiosity starts to predominate.

1506
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:09,690
So they go back to the open area subject
to poke their heads out of the tunnel,

1507
01:29:09,691 --> 01:29:13,500
openings to scan the open area where the
cat was presented for minutes or hours

1508
01:29:13,501 --> 01:29:16,410
before emerging.
So they're like watching this is new

1509
01:29:16,411 --> 01:29:18,880
territory now.
There was not supposed to be a cap

1510
01:29:18,881 --> 01:29:20,400
there.
So let's just see what happens.

1511
01:29:20,401 --> 01:29:24,030
So they're watching in Washington
remapping the territory when they do

1512
01:29:24,031 --> 01:29:27,010
emerge there locomotory patents or
characterize while they couldn't have

1513
01:29:27,011 --> 01:29:30,120
run flat so they can't be seen.
But the thing that's really neat is they

1514
01:29:30,121 --> 01:29:33,330
do short corner runs.
I think this is so interesting.

1515
01:29:33,331 --> 01:29:36,630
So you think here's the area the calf
was seen.

1516
01:29:36,631 --> 01:29:37,240
Okay,

1517
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:41,560
so it's like
cat

1518
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:45,280
right now,
the rats on the cat there.

1519
01:29:45,281 --> 01:29:47,800
So this is,
this is all of a sudden being reading

1520
01:29:47,801 --> 01:29:51,120
novelized.
This area was once map and made secure.

1521
01:29:51,121 --> 01:29:53,620
But the appearance of the cap there is
throwing their plans for a loop.

1522
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,990
So one of the routes do,
well the catch disappeared,

1523
01:29:55,991 --> 01:29:59,650
but they don't trust this area anymore
because it was associated with the cat.

1524
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:04,450
So they do corner rugs.
The bravest of rats leaps out of his

1525
01:30:04,451 --> 01:30:06,440
title.
And Bratton was right across a small

1526
01:30:06,441 --> 01:30:09,190
area and if if he doesn't get killed,

1527
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,073
that's safe,

1528
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:17,930
so then it grows back.
It takes not choke up safe.

1529
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:22,430
Other rats are in the same place soon if
there's no cat.

1530
01:30:22,710 --> 01:30:23,900
Hilarious mapped.
Again,

1531
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:30,410
these risk assessment areas appear to
involve active gathering information

1532
01:30:30,411 --> 01:30:33,740
about possible dangerous sources
providing a basis for a gradual return

1533
01:30:33,741 --> 01:30:38,741
to non defensive bt active risk
assessment has not seen during early

1534
01:30:38,811 --> 01:30:42,290
post cat exposure but rises to a peak
about 10 hours later.

1535
01:30:42,530 --> 01:30:46,430
These rats are scared.
Non Defensive behaviors such as eating,

1536
01:30:46,431 --> 01:30:49,370
drinking sexually aggressive activity
tend to be reduced over the same period.

1537
01:30:50,410 --> 01:30:52,500
That's because of the anxiety system
just predominance.

1538
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:54,900
You don't think about anything else when
there's a cab around,

1539
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:58,340
so it's such a great,
it's such a great story because you get

1540
01:30:58,341 --> 01:31:02,690
an idea of how their Massey University
is set up like there was known territory

1541
01:31:02,810 --> 01:31:05,870
and then there's on unknown territory
and well known and known territory can

1542
01:31:05,871 --> 01:31:08,960
turn into unknown territory as soon as
something unpredictable happens and when

1543
01:31:08,961 --> 01:31:12,650
something unpredictable happens.
That hilarious is made novel again and

1544
01:31:12,651 --> 01:31:16,490
the rats have to undergo is very complex
pattern of exploratory activity to make

1545
01:31:16,491 --> 01:31:19,010
their territory secure again.
So that's,

1546
01:31:19,130 --> 01:31:21,770
that's quite interesting.
It was also the case.

1547
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:27,770
Yeah.
Like I gave you here a representation of

1548
01:31:27,771 --> 01:31:32,590
novelty.
That's what normal people,

1549
01:31:32,830 --> 01:31:37,830
it's half threat to me produces anxiety,
taft promise and impels exploratory

1550
01:31:38,831 --> 01:31:40,630
activity.
Anxiety comes up first.

1551
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:44,080
This has be known among behavioral
psychologists for about five decades.

1552
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:48,610
It's like
the exploratory and anxiety circuitry

1553
01:31:48,611 --> 01:31:51,370
are mutually inhibitory,
but the anxiety circuitry has the upper

1554
01:31:51,371 --> 01:31:55,750
edge in terms of potency and rapidity of
rise and fundamental

1555
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:59,350
so long.
Okay,

1556
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:04,250
so let me show you something.
Well,

1557
01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:08,620
it's also the case.
So racks,

1558
01:32:08,621 --> 01:32:12,490
they identify each other by smell,
and if you smell like you should smell,

1559
01:32:12,491 --> 01:32:14,790
then you're familiar.
You're not contaminated with the

1560
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:16,900
unknown.
So your behavior is predictable,

1561
01:32:16,901 --> 01:32:20,110
which basically means that I know your
place in the dominance hierarchy.

1562
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:23,350
I know what role you play with all the
other animals,

1563
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:26,290
and I know how to behave in your
presence.

1564
01:32:26,410 --> 01:32:27,720
You're familiar.
You're Ken.

1565
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:30,220
And I can tell that if I'm a rat bite of
the way that you spell,

1566
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:33,190
okay,
so you take a rat that everyone loves

1567
01:32:33,310 --> 01:32:37,390
and you pull it out of its cage and you
wash it off and you throw it back in

1568
01:32:37,391 --> 01:32:42,391
with the rats would kill it because that
rat is now contaminated with the unknown

1569
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:47,770
and we don't like to have the unknown
around because it upsets our

1570
01:32:47,771 --> 01:32:50,260
predictability and whatever.
Predictability gets upset that our

1571
01:32:50,261 --> 01:32:54,790
anxiety levels rise and all hell breaks
loose and literally all hell breaks

1572
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:57,310
loose.
That's actually pam is a mythological

1573
01:32:57,311 --> 01:33:01,600
representations of the unknown.
These fats in part,

1574
01:33:04,070 --> 01:33:04,903
yeah,

1575
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:09,610
from the mythological perspective of the
world has three constituent elements,

1576
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:12,280
the unknown,
which is everywhere,

1577
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:15,760
the known and the process by which one
has turned into the other,

1578
01:33:15,761 --> 01:33:20,761
which is basically exploration.
So the knower is the archetypical

1579
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:26,230
archetipal pattern of expiration.
The thing that mediates between the

1580
01:33:26,231 --> 01:33:29,050
unknown and the known and from the
mythological perspective part of the

1581
01:33:29,051 --> 01:33:32,380
process creates the world.
See that's the,

1582
01:33:32,381 --> 01:33:35,620
that's absolutely fascinating too if you
think about it from him because he can

1583
01:33:35,621 --> 01:33:37,800
think about something like the fact of
say,

1584
01:33:37,801 --> 01:33:41,620
a our democratic system now,
our democratic system is deeply rooted

1585
01:33:41,621 --> 01:33:44,050
in religious presuppositions bidding,
which we forget now,

1586
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:46,540
but it doesn't really matter.
They're still there.

1587
01:33:46,630 --> 01:33:48,010
They're implicit.
They're there.

1588
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,080
Now,
one of the implicit presumptions is that

1589
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:54,190
every individual in our society is
worthy of respect.

1590
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:57,190
That's the core aspect of your natural,
right?

1591
01:33:57,191 --> 01:33:58,930
Fundamentally,
even if you're a criminal,

1592
01:33:58,931 --> 01:34:02,710
like even if you've broken rules that
you admit you broken in this society and

1593
01:34:02,711 --> 01:34:04,450
others that have the same preset
positions,

1594
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:06,280
you,
you still have a whole sequence of

1595
01:34:06,281 --> 01:34:11,281
rights that cannot be violated because
in principle there's something about you

1596
01:34:12,370 --> 01:34:15,790
that's worthy of respect regardless of
your behavior.

1597
01:34:16,650 --> 01:34:19,330
The question is what is,
what is that?

1598
01:34:19,740 --> 01:34:22,030
Well,
I think even see this in simpler social

1599
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:23,050
animals like wolves.

1600
01:34:23,470 --> 01:34:24,303
Yeah.

1601
01:34:25,210 --> 01:34:26,260
Oops.
Well,

1602
01:34:26,261 --> 01:34:27,640
they live in social groups.
They have dominance.

1603
01:34:27,641 --> 01:34:30,310
Hierarchies and wolves are always trying
to climb up the dominance hierarchy,

1604
01:34:30,311 --> 01:34:32,470
which is good for the wolf pack,
cause the strongest animal,

1605
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:34,150
more or less,
the most competent animal.

1606
01:34:34,151 --> 01:34:36,100
It shouldn't be at the top,
but anyways,

1607
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:40,900
if one will fight with another wolf and
they very seldom injure each other if

1608
01:34:40,901 --> 01:34:43,450
they're in the same group,
which is good because you don't want the

1609
01:34:43,451 --> 01:34:47,140
group diminished by constant intergroup
intergroup conflict.

1610
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:49,780
Well,
the talk wolf,

1611
01:34:50,150 --> 01:34:53,090
the wolf who wins the conflict,
which is usually more of threat

1612
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,060
posturing than actual physical
engagement,

1613
01:34:55,061 --> 01:34:59,000
although sometimes a real fight breaks
out if wolf that loses the dominance

1614
01:34:59,001 --> 01:35:02,930
dispute benefits submissive behaviors,
which basically means it rolls over and

1615
01:35:02,931 --> 01:35:05,690
shows its throat,
which means you can kill me now if you

1616
01:35:05,691 --> 01:35:07,760
want to talk,
we'll stops and you can say,

1617
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:12,440
well,
the stronger wolf packs as if it's

1618
01:35:12,441 --> 01:35:17,270
constrained by knowledge that even the
weaker members of the group still can

1619
01:35:17,271 --> 01:35:19,760
conceivably contribute something of
value to the group.

1620
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:21,230
Well,
that's what we're like to in our

1621
01:35:21,470 --> 01:35:25,280
organizations except we've got,
we've got that principal up almost to

1622
01:35:25,281 --> 01:35:30,170
the point where we understand that it's
the individual who in contact with the

1623
01:35:30,171 --> 01:35:34,670
unknown generates inflammation and that
inflammation constitutes the group and

1624
01:35:34,671 --> 01:35:38,380
the individual is valuable because they
are in fact assimilated to the

1625
01:35:38,390 --> 01:35:41,240
mythological perspective,
to the force that creates the world,

1626
01:35:41,241 --> 01:35:45,550
which is basically the forest that
renders the unknown,

1627
01:35:45,551 --> 01:35:49,550
predictable or that creates order out of
chaos and say the aspect of people

1628
01:35:49,551 --> 01:35:53,540
that's divine theoretically is the part
that stands on the border between the

1629
01:35:53,541 --> 01:35:57,590
unknown and the known and the most
information from unexplored territory in

1630
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,280
two explored territory.
Expanding the dog to the dominion of the

1631
01:36:01,281 --> 01:36:02,300
group.
That's

1632
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:05,780
okay.
Who's this?

1633
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:09,710
I says Kelly,
the devour.

1634
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:12,850
She's a negative mother,
so to speak,

1635
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:15,160
from a mythological perspective and I
find very,

1636
01:36:15,161 --> 01:36:15,950
very interesting.

1637
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:18,470
She's the best representation of this
sort of thing that I've ever seen.

1638
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:22,520
If the myth that you think maths,
they last a long time,

1639
01:36:22,521 --> 01:36:25,000
sometimes tens of thousands of years and
they,

1640
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:28,740
they often even last across cultures and
you think,

1641
01:36:28,760 --> 01:36:29,630
who are they?
How is it?

1642
01:36:29,631 --> 01:36:34,631
What could the story actually be telling
you that could be useful given that much

1643
01:36:35,631 --> 01:36:38,010
change?
Well,

1644
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:42,980
the mythological world that stories are
concerned with is composed of three

1645
01:36:42,981 --> 01:36:44,150
things.
The unknown,

1646
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:46,900
but it's always there.
It doesn't matter when you live or where

1647
01:36:46,901 --> 01:36:48,980
you live or who you are,
that's part of your experience.

1648
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:50,540
It's always going to be part of your
experience.

1649
01:36:50,541 --> 01:36:53,160
It doesn't matter how much you know,
there's always things that you can

1650
01:36:53,161 --> 01:36:55,610
predict.
The more you know what the more

1651
01:36:55,611 --> 01:36:58,580
potential problems there are,
because knowledge in itself even breeds

1652
01:36:58,581 --> 01:37:00,140
new problems.
That's always there.

1653
01:37:00,380 --> 01:37:02,270
The fact of culture is always there.

1654
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:07,040
I mean the cultures may change,
but the fact that there's culture and

1655
01:37:07,041 --> 01:37:09,830
that you're a product of culture and
that you have to add to it or at least

1656
01:37:09,980 --> 01:37:13,970
establish some relationship to it,
that it protects you and creates you and

1657
01:37:13,971 --> 01:37:16,070
that you contribute to it and that never
changes.

1658
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:19,130
And the fact that you're the
intermediary between those two forces,

1659
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:22,430
that never changes.
And that's what describes those three

1660
01:37:22,431 --> 01:37:26,210
things.
This is a representation of the unknown.

1661
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,950
The unknown is also as well as being the
thing that gives rise to everything.

1662
01:37:30,951 --> 01:37:35,450
It's also the thing that destroys.
Everything gets on the things that we

1663
01:37:35,451 --> 01:37:39,560
cannot control it in the final analysis
lead to our demise.

1664
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:42,020
It's our ignorance that causes our death
in a sense.

1665
01:37:42,021 --> 01:37:45,620
We just can't stop something.
He can't stop aging disease.

1666
01:37:46,010 --> 01:37:48,680
We can't stop starvation.
There's are all things that we haven't

1667
01:37:48,681 --> 01:37:50,990
got a grip on there.
All things that are still unknown,

1668
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:52,970
unpredictable,
and sooner or later they get us.

1669
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:57,750
Let's look at Kelly.
Well,

1670
01:37:57,751 --> 01:38:00,090
the first thing I'd like to say,
like I said,

1671
01:38:00,091 --> 01:38:03,270
the unknown automatically frightened to
us or other things that automatically

1672
01:38:03,271 --> 01:38:05,670
frightened us more or less.
There's some dispute about this and the

1673
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:08,010
behavioral insurance.
There are things that you can learn to

1674
01:38:08,011 --> 01:38:10,770
become afraid of very easily.
Spiders,

1675
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:14,160
snakes,
fire alarm skeletons,

1676
01:38:14,161 --> 01:38:18,590
disembodied bodies.
Those are all elements of horror movies.

1677
01:38:18,591 --> 01:38:20,490
It's pretty obvious that people are more
and less afraid of them.

1678
01:38:20,491 --> 01:38:22,110
It's not that difficult to figure out
why.

1679
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:25,530
The only debate in them in the,
in the psychological literature is

1680
01:38:25,531 --> 01:38:29,760
whether those fears are actually nate or
whether you have to acquire them through

1681
01:38:29,761 --> 01:38:32,490
very brief exposure.
It doesn't matter as far as I'm

1682
01:38:32,491 --> 01:38:34,710
concerned.
The point is is that those things might

1683
01:38:34,711 --> 01:38:39,090
be regarded as
extraordinarily appropriate.

1684
01:38:39,091 --> 01:38:42,780
Representatives of the unknown.
What's myth trying to do?

1685
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:48,090
It's trying to encapsulate behavioral
wisdom under what circumstances and what

1686
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:48,930
world?

1687
01:38:48,930 --> 01:38:50,400
Well,
the answer to that is in the world

1688
01:38:50,401 --> 01:38:55,050
that's composed of the unknown,
the known and the mediating force say if

1689
01:38:55,051 --> 01:38:57,750
you have to adapt to the unknown,
which you have to do.

1690
01:38:58,020 --> 01:39:01,620
The thing to do logically say you'd have
an infinite amount of time at your

1691
01:39:01,621 --> 01:39:05,880
disposal is to come up with a
representation of what the unknown is a

1692
01:39:05,881 --> 01:39:07,860
strange thing to do because you don't
know what it is.

1693
01:39:07,861 --> 01:39:09,930
So the question is how the hell can you
represent it?

1694
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:12,870
But the one thing you do know about it,
it's always the case is that it makes

1695
01:39:12,871 --> 01:39:16,920
you afraid and it makes you curious.
So if you want to make a representation

1696
01:39:16,921 --> 01:39:19,830
of it,
then you use those things that you do

1697
01:39:19,831 --> 01:39:21,600
know.
Something about that either make you

1698
01:39:21,601 --> 01:39:25,470
afraid or curious and let's look at this
figure figure to who,

1699
01:39:25,530 --> 01:39:27,930
whom at some point in history and not so
long ago,

1700
01:39:27,931 --> 01:39:30,040
human sacrifices pro actually offered
it.

1701
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:31,830
We're on,
we're going to look a little bit at the

1702
01:39:31,831 --> 01:39:33,570
reasons for that.
This is Kelly.

1703
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:37,080
She is the thing that everything goes
back to she's a representative of the

1704
01:39:37,081 --> 01:39:38,060
unknown.
Well,

1705
01:39:38,061 --> 01:39:41,490
let's look at her now.
She's something that produces religious

1706
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:45,030
devotion in those who apprehend her
presence.

1707
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:49,280
Seizure of meaning fundamentally,
which you could assimilate to and

1708
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:53,790
religious experience.
She has eight legs like a spider.

1709
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:57,630
She spins the web of faith.
That's the reason the web has made a

1710
01:39:57,631 --> 01:40:00,320
fire.
Her hair's on fire too by the way.

1711
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:07,010
She sits in the middle of that way.
She has a head dress of skulls and

1712
01:40:07,441 --> 01:40:12,441
usually has a snake around her waist.
A snake's a symbol of transformation

1713
01:40:12,721 --> 01:40:15,390
because it sheds its skin,
so theoretically did something that's

1714
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:17,370
reborn anyways.
Um,

1715
01:40:18,090 --> 01:40:23,090
she often has staring eyes protruding
teeth to something else that people are

1716
01:40:23,491 --> 01:40:28,491
pretty much in a predisposed to respond
to and she is so in her hands are tools

1717
01:40:29,851 --> 01:40:34,710
of creation and destruction and she's
simultaneously giving birth to this

1718
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:39,270
gentleman and eating here.
That

1719
01:40:41,010 --> 01:40:44,760
symbol that,
and I would say,

1720
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:46,160
well,
okay,

1721
01:40:46,830 --> 01:40:49,860
now you understand two things.
You understand that you have an innate

1722
01:40:49,861 --> 01:40:51,690
response for the unknown and the next
APP,

1723
01:40:51,930 --> 01:40:55,000
permanent constituent elements of
experience from the perspective of

1724
01:40:55,001 --> 01:40:55,834
emotion.

1725
01:40:58,810 --> 01:41:02,170
And if you look at figure like that,
then you can get some comprehension of

1726
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:07,810
what it is that people are trying to
avoid contacting the attempt to maintain

1727
01:41:07,811 --> 01:41:08,790
things predictable.

1728
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:24,980
Well,
I'm just going to close this,

1729
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,640
I guess.
Um,

1730
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,640
this is a hint about the second part of
the course.

1731
01:41:31,641 --> 01:41:33,890
So the first part of the car,
while it's going to,

1732
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:36,830
there's one,
there's a lot more detail to the story

1733
01:41:36,831 --> 01:41:40,580
than I brand across today and there's
some complicating factors that make the

1734
01:41:40,581 --> 01:41:43,090
whole story much more interesting.
I mean,

1735
01:41:43,170 --> 01:41:45,620
this is interesting already.
I think this is the most,

1736
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,980
this is,
has something to do with hope.

1737
01:41:49,170 --> 01:41:52,400
When let's say you're a natively
predisposed to respond to the

1738
01:41:52,401 --> 01:41:55,190
unpredictable with anxiety and perhaps
to eliminate it.

1739
01:41:55,191 --> 01:41:57,320
If you care,
you can understand why that is,

1740
01:41:57,321 --> 01:41:59,660
but you need to be able to predict your
circumstances.

1741
01:41:59,930 --> 01:42:02,930
You have to be able,
you kind of just give up your story or

1742
01:42:02,931 --> 01:42:06,260
your culture because that throws you
completely emptied chaos and that's

1743
01:42:06,350 --> 01:42:08,720
unpleasant because unpleasant does
anything you could imagine

1744
01:42:11,260 --> 01:42:13,930
what other people believe different
things and obviously when you come into

1745
01:42:13,931 --> 01:42:16,840
contact with him,
while there's a high likelihood of

1746
01:42:16,841 --> 01:42:19,810
depression and aggression of such
magnitude that there's a good

1747
01:42:19,811 --> 01:42:22,930
probability that you'll be destroyed and
some of the person that you're

1748
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:25,550
aggressing against that just really
striking as you know,

1749
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:29,080
all that greatest solution.
On the one hand you give up your ideas

1750
01:42:29,081 --> 01:42:30,770
for,
then you are subject to half active

1751
01:42:30,790 --> 01:42:33,190
dysregulation of the most intolerable.
Sorry.

1752
01:42:33,430 --> 01:42:36,430
On the other hand,
if you pursue your particular ideas in

1753
01:42:36,431 --> 01:42:39,490
the face of opposition,
then you might run into a circumstance

1754
01:42:39,491 --> 01:42:41,970
where aggression is inevitable and
that'd be the end of the year.

1755
01:42:42,850 --> 01:42:45,690
This is a bad sort of paradox.
Oh,

1756
01:42:46,930 --> 01:42:49,360
so what can be done about that?
Well that has,

1757
01:42:49,690 --> 01:42:52,630
I guess you could say,
to give you the answer in the tiniest

1758
01:42:52,650 --> 01:42:56,030
sort of the shelves and has something to
do with your attitude towards anomalous

1759
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:59,890
information,
have the highest likelihood of not

1760
01:42:59,891 --> 01:43:04,060
falling into this sort of trap.
If when something unexpected happens to

1761
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:08,590
you register and you explore it to see
why it was that you were wrong,

1762
01:43:08,650 --> 01:43:11,950
to accept the fact of the anomalous
information and to explore it.

1763
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:17,710
This is a nice figure and I'll close
with a discussion with just a brief

1764
01:43:17,711 --> 01:43:19,290
discussion of this.
That's a bonus.

1765
01:43:19,291 --> 01:43:22,120
Sound Fun.
It's an eastern image.

1766
01:43:22,750 --> 01:43:26,350
Then I suppose you could assimilate to
some degree to Christ in the West.

1767
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:32,400
It's an image of the hero and the hero
is the intermediary between the known

1768
01:43:33,281 --> 01:43:34,730
and the unknown.
Tierra.

1769
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:37,050
Listen,
first one goes out where it's

1770
01:43:37,090 --> 01:43:39,490
frightening.
See this little dragon stories should

1771
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:43,090
have mentioned that dragon dragons,
they live in the bottom of the mountain

1772
01:43:43,091 --> 01:43:46,100
and they sit on a treasure and if he
want to treasure you,

1773
01:43:46,150 --> 01:43:48,760
go out of your community is threatened
by the Dragon.

1774
01:43:49,030 --> 01:43:51,860
If you weren't the church you go to and
slayer overcome with drag.

1775
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,080
Bringing back the treasure.
When you come back,

1776
01:43:54,081 --> 01:43:57,370
then your communities transform.
The last of the story about explorations

1777
01:43:57,410 --> 01:44:00,320
is the dragon isn't the thing to
simultaneously threatened in the

1778
01:44:00,321 --> 01:44:03,530
promising as well as archaic and ancient
and our full,

1779
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:07,520
the hero is the person leaves in the
community to encounter that

1780
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:15,220
arc in temple phenomena to overcome it,
to get the tragedy to bring it back to

1781
01:44:15,651 --> 01:44:17,720
the community,
which is therefore you rich.

1782
01:44:17,930 --> 01:44:20,030
That's the path of the hero.
This,

1783
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:25,820
this is a very interesting image.
That finger see the attempt by the

1784
01:44:25,851 --> 01:44:28,760
author to make it recurring ready and
this is,

1785
01:44:28,761 --> 01:44:32,360
this is the sky by the way,
and this might be conceived of as a

1786
01:44:32,361 --> 01:44:36,640
tunnel,
but it's a tunnel into time and into

1787
01:44:36,660 --> 01:44:38,510
space.
This is the most,

1788
01:44:38,720 --> 01:44:41,780
this is the present and this is the
past.

1789
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:45,110
Does it extends back as far as can
possibly be imagined.

1790
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:49,760
This finger sits on me or I know,
I know it's kind of blurry and that's

1791
01:44:49,761 --> 01:44:52,430
unfortunate,
but let me see here.

1792
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:57,080
See these fingers at the bottom.
These are figures that are very much

1793
01:44:57,081 --> 01:45:00,590
like Kelly,
same sort of thing.

1794
01:45:01,550 --> 01:45:06,550
This representation is this figure of
triumphing in a sense over this speaker,

1795
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:11,750
this
swelling by fire as well,

1796
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:16,840
and it's a symbol of transformation.
This is an attempt to portray the fact

1797
01:45:17,630 --> 01:45:22,630
that the pattern of behavior that is
characteristic of the hero is something

1798
01:45:23,001 --> 01:45:25,640
that constantly recurs through time.

1799
01:45:25,730 --> 01:45:27,710
That's an architect from the union
perspective,

1800
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:32,330
just the fact of exploration and the
tendency for us,

1801
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:36,080
that's an ending bill,
part of the human psyche biologically

1802
01:45:36,081 --> 01:45:38,660
predicate it.
It's part of the,

1803
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:40,700
it's part of the apparatus that you
inherit,

1804
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:41,593
so to speak.
It.

1805
01:45:41,700 --> 01:45:43,940
It's nothing to do with inherited
memories or anything,

1806
01:45:44,210 --> 01:45:44,780
anything,
man,

1807
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:47,210
I'll just try.
It just has to do with the fact that

1808
01:45:47,211 --> 01:45:50,060
that's the sort of creature you are.
You're always,

1809
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:53,690
you always serve as the intermediary
between unexplored territory,

1810
01:45:53,691 --> 01:45:55,040
unexplored territory.
That's true.

1811
01:45:55,041 --> 01:45:57,110
No matter where you live.
This is a finger then,

1812
01:45:58,820 --> 01:46:03,420
well that isn't drawing that attempts to
represent that idea pictorially.

1813
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:07,370
It's very cold.
Most religious traditions,

1814
01:46:08,810 --> 01:46:12,230
perhaps with the exception
of course,

1815
01:46:12,231 --> 01:46:17,231
there's always exceptions are predicated
on the notion that identity identity

1816
01:46:17,811 --> 01:46:22,060
with this figure right in it with this
finger is necessarily up the core,

1817
01:46:22,130 --> 01:46:25,940
proper human adaptation.
And without that identification and

1818
01:46:25,941 --> 01:46:27,680
chaos will necessarily ring.

1819
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:36,220
Okay,
sure.

1820
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:45,593
Yeah.

1821
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:55,350
So does everybody have a syllabus?
Okay.

1822
01:46:55,351 --> 01:46:58,250
Does everybody have the directions to
the coffee shop

1823
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:34,460
for a
long time?

1824
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:41,100
For a long time,
he was the only neuro psychologist that

1825
01:47:41,101 --> 01:47:44,910
I knew of in North America who's
actually interested in

1826
01:47:53,010 --> 01:47:58,010
some of the ideas that are
in

1827
01:48:24,530 --> 01:48:29,530
your name and your student Id.
You're welcome,

1828
01:48:47,110 --> 01:48:52,110
dawn
there.

1829
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:27,750
Mark,
they're downstairs in my office.

1830
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:32,840
I'm going to put the mode.
What's the course number?

1831
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Two four three five
no,

1832
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:58,510
cause I have a sabbatical next year,
so it's,

1833
01:49:58,511 --> 01:50:01,550
it's not a good idea.
You should find someone who was around

1834
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:10,520
as long as long as you're convinced that
you can.

1835
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,750
Oh,
good.

1836
01:50:25,370 --> 01:50:30,370
Okay.
Do you have any

1837
01:50:39,410 --> 01:50:41,020
oh,
12 bucks or something?

1838
01:50:41,030 --> 01:50:42,420
Some very expensive.
Okay,

1839
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:48,320
thanks.
Yup.

1840
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:18,270
Mechanisms
you might try.

1841
01:51:32,361 --> 01:51:37,270
Rich
might be relevant.
