1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
The problem with wanting to be friends 
with your child is that that's not good 

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:07,020
enough because as a parent,
you're not less than a friend.

3
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:10,410
You're far more than a friend.
You're someone that's going to be in the

4
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:12,660
child's life for the duration of your 
life.

5
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:17,430
With any luck,
you're a longterm island of stability in

6
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:18,264
a sea of turbulence,
and the child needs that far more than 

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,063
than he or she needs a friend.
Parents need to be courageous because 

8
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:29,520
they have to let their children go and 
make mistakes.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,130
You have to let your child fall when 
they're learning to walk.

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,100
They bump themselves up against the 
world a lot,

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,600
and you don't want to do any more for 
your child than you absolutely have to,

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,200
and it means that there's a certain 
amount of detached harshness that has to

13
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:44,990
go along with your love and compassion.

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,590
You have to stand back and let your 
child stumble forward towards mastery.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,633
Today's parents are terrified of their 
children because they're often afraid 

16
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:54,354
that if they intervene in their lives,
that they'll make a mistake and that 

17
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:01,320
that will be irrevocable.
And you have to have the courage of your

18
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:02,154
convictions when you have children.
And you have to understand that if you 

19
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:05,094
do make mistakes,
that you can learn and you can be 

20
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:10,200
forgiven.
You don't have to be a perfect parent,

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,540
although you should aim up with your 
children.

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,330
Parents are terrified of making 
mistakes,

23
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:18,360
and that means that they're terrified of
being parents and they,

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,190
and that stops them from being parents.
