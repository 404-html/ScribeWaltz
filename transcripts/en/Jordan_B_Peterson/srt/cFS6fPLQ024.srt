1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
Hey,
so we divided up the brain one way

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,880
and now we're going to divide it up
another way,

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:09,570
and so this is the brain from the top
down and you know you have two

4
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:11,100
hemispheres and you might think,
well,

5
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:13,170
why do you need two hemispheres?
Do you know?

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,180
By the way,
some of you probably know this,

7
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:20,181
that a Zana who's a relatively famous
neuropsychologist,

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,910
studied split brain patients.
Now you know that your cortical

9
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:26,670
hemispheres,
your brain is united down in the

10
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:28,030
subcortical areas.
You know,

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,040
it's sort of stuck together.
Although you have twin 11 twins of many

12
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:37,460
of the subcortical structures like you
have to Hipaa camp,

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,300
eye to Amygdala,
for example,

14
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:42,810
one on each side,
but at the top the hemispheres are quite

15
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:46,170
separate and,
but they're connected by the Corpus

16
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,230
callosum which makes them communicate.
It's kind of interesting because you

17
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:51,150
kind of wonder,
well why aren't they just all glued

18
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:51,720
together?

19
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,940
You know,
and what it seems to indicate is that

20
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:58,890
there's some utility of functional
independence combined with some utility

21
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:00,240
of communication,
you know,

22
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:03,180
so it might be like,
do you really want to be networked at

23
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:04,950
the same time?
To everyone in the world,

24
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:05,911
it's like,
no,

25
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:09,690
you don't.
You want some narrow channel pathways so

26
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:11,730
that only the important information
comes through,

27
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,560
so it's sort of maybe like the right
hemisphere is one kind of computational

28
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,390
device in the left hemisphere is another
kind of computational device.

29
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,340
Of course they're not computational
devices,

30
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:24,180
but you get the point and only the
important information and process

31
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,430
information from the right hemisphere
goes across and only the process,

32
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:30,750
the information from the left hemisphere
goes across something like that,

33
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,050
whatever.
If you have someone who's epileptic or

34
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,110
or that that has a brain illness of some
sort of specific type,

35
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:43,710
it's usually epilepsy but not always and
you do surgery on them and you cut the

36
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:44,730
Corpus callosum.

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,540
What you find weirdly enough is that
each hemisphere develops its own

38
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:52,050
personality and so it's Kinda Nice as
other evidence.

39
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:56,100
I would say for the idea that what the
brain does is produce personalities,

40
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:58,890
right?
You can keep pairing the brain down and

41
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:02,730
what it's going to do is produce lower
and lower resolution personalities all

42
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:05,520
the way down to the bottom.
They're just known as detailed.

43
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,530
They're like,
if you lost,

44
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:11,310
say 80 percent of your cortex randomly,
you'd sort of be like a thumbnail of

45
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:13,980
yourself,
so you'd still be you,

46
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:18,300
but just not at the same detail.
So I'll tell you,

47
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:20,790
here's an interesting idea from the
Catholics.

48
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,070
It kind of goes along with the Avatar
idea.

49
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,630
So the Catholics had been wrestling for
a long time with the question about how

50
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:30,840
God could have fit himself in the human
body because you could imagine that

51
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:31,940
would obsess Christians.

52
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,990
It's like God is great,
Big God and you know,

53
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:37,620
little bitty body put God in there,
just bursts the boundaries.

54
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,260
Well,
they have this idea called Kenosis,

55
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,790
which means emptying.
And so the idea is that God had to empty

56
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,800
himself,
followed before and get inhabited human

57
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:49,470
body and it's very much like a thumbnail
ideas.

58
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:52,560
So you know,
and young would have of course thought

59
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,560
exactly that the self was a thumbnail of
God.

60
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:57,540
I mean,
if you wouldn't put it that way,

61
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,280
but definitely that's where his thinking
was leading.

62
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,550
So.
So that's a pretty damn cool idea.

63
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,210
So anyways,
so this is from.

64
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,360
I developed this before I ran what I'm
going to tell you,

65
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,390
but it doesn't matter because I'm going
to talk about it from another theorist,

66
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:18,260
his point of view,
the guy I'm going to tell you about,

67
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,850
his name is Al Cohen and Goldberg and
he's a neuropsychologist and he was one

68
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,880
of learning as students who ended up in
New York and Goldberg was obviously

69
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:29,690
influenced by Luria and all the Sokolov
and vinegar,

70
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:32,320
silver and gray and all those people
that I've already talked to you about

71
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,680
and he was interested in why you have
two hemispheres.

72
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,440
Well,
there's a bunch of things that you can

73
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:40,570
say broadly speaking about the
hemispheres,

74
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:42,250
and I've written them some of them down
there,

75
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:46,030
so the right hemisphere.
This is an idealized representation of a

76
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:49,300
relatively highly lateralized right
handed male,

77
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,890
and the reason I'm saying that is men
seem to be more lateralized than women

78
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,910
and the right handed lateralization is
the standard kind,

79
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,270
but you know the brain can be louder,
lysed all sorts of ways.

80
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,160
What you might say is that
there's a bunch of ways of looking at

81
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:08,080
it.
One way you can look at it is that your

82
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:13,081
cortex gets colonized by underlying
structures so and that each underlying

83
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:18,610
structure is likely to call annise a
particular area.

84
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:19,870
So for example,
when you,

85
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,690
when you are born and you wake up and
you see your eyes are going to call an

86
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,410
eyes,
your visual Cortex,

87
00:04:26,411 --> 00:04:28,930
most likely because it's sort of adapted
for that,

88
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,620
but if you don't have a visual Cortex,
then your eyes will colonize something

89
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:33,454
else.

90
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,470
So,
so that's.

91
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,100
So the brain has proclivities towards a
certain kind of structure,

92
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:43,300
but especially early in development.
It's unbelievably plastic.

93
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:47,140
And so brains can be organized in
lateralized in a bunch of different

94
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:50,350
ways.
But so to simplify what you do is you

95
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:51,190
kind of take,
okay,

96
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:56,191
well let's take the most straightforward
and typical brain and talk about it as

97
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:00,310
if it's the canonical brain.
But I think what you can say is

98
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:02,950
regardless of where these systems are
localized,

99
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,220
they exist.
So it's an over simplification,

100
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,670
whatever.
It doesn't matter what you've got with

101
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:12,940
regards to your core to cs is a quick
and dirty cortex and that's the right

102
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:15,790
hemisphere.
And then you've got a longterm detailed

103
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,540
cortex and that's the left hemisphere,
left hemisphere,

104
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,310
specialized for language language,
cuts,

105
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:25,090
things up into little tiny bitty pieces,
you know.

106
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:28,760
And that's really useful if you're doing
little tiny bitty things and you

107
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,730
shouldn't be precision,
right?

108
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,120
Pinpoint accuracy.
But that takes a lot of time and a lot

109
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:36,040
of computation.
Whereas the right hemisphere says,

110
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:36,820
yeah,
yeah,

111
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,020
let's get to the bloody point,
you know?

112
00:05:39,021 --> 00:05:41,140
And so it captures the thing in an
image.

113
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,020
So like the monster I showed you from
the hippy cartoon,

114
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,880
that's a right hemisphere thing.
It's an image that represents a class of

115
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,700
entities and which of course the images
do.

116
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,710
Now,
here's this woman named

117
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,480
I
carefree number autistic woman.

118
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,910
She's a developed cattle handling
facilities all across.

119
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,040
What's her name?
Temple.

120
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:07,731
Grandin.
Yes.

121
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:12,400
Very cool person I saw at temple grandin
speak at the University of Arizona at

122
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,380
the consciousness conference.
And it was like the funniest speech I'd

123
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:17,900
ever seen in my life.
Not because it wasn't perfect,

124
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:20,720
it was bloody perfect.
Like she's a tough woman.

125
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:23,840
She looks like a cowboy and she spent a
lot of time with animals.

126
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,980
She kind of comes out on the stage and
her cowboy outfit and she's unbelievably

127
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:31,700
straightforward and without nuance.
She's autistic,

128
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,040
she's severely autistic and she,
you know,

129
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,160
her mother helped her a lot and she
developed this thing that you would go

130
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:41,720
inside to compress her and hold her was
a little machine and that would comfort

131
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:42,620
her.
Anyways,

132
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:47,210
she turned herself into quite the quite
the person and she thinks she thinks

133
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:50,630
like an animal,
which is why she can design cattle

134
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:54,620
handling facility often slaughter houses
so that the cattle don't get all freaked

135
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:57,090
out as they're on their way to their
eventual demise.

136
00:06:57,091 --> 00:07:01,190
And so one of the things she does is she
walks through where the counselor going

137
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:04,610
in anything that bothers her,
she assumes will bother a cow.

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,820
So for example,
if the cows are walking through this say

139
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,200
spiral or they're on their way to the
slaughterhouse and there's a coke can

140
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,900
lying on the ground,
all the cows will stop and look at the

141
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,640
coke can to normalist.

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,480
Now.
She talked a lot about how she thought

143
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:25,481
and what she said was she could not
devise abstract representations.

144
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,320
So she said,
okay,

145
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,830
imagine,
imagine how a child draws a house.

146
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,210
Okay,
so what,

147
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,770
what is he now?
Charles' house,

148
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:36,860
right?
There's a triangle and a square on the

149
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:39,500
left,
and then there's another rectangle and

150
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:43,970
another kind of Parallelogram,
and then there's a door and two windows,

151
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:45,770
right?
Then there's a chimney with smoke coming

152
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:46,850
out,
which is quite cool.

153
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:48,260
It's like,
why is that?

154
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,310
Where's the smoke?
You know,

155
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:51,710
you don't see that modern houses,
but kids still do that.

156
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,620
It's like,
then maybe there's a tree and usually

157
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:58,160
there's a sun and then house.
It's like you think,

158
00:07:58,161 --> 00:07:59,180
oh,
isn't that cute?

159
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:00,980
A simple drug.
It's like that drawing.

160
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,710
It's not simple.
You've never seen a house that looks

161
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:07,400
like that in your life.
It looks nothing like a house.

162
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,320
It's not a house,
it's not a picture.

163
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:13,640
It's a hero cliff.
It's a pre linguistic representation and

164
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:16,490
it's like the essential elements of
house.

165
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,750
And so you might say what the child has
done is extracted out all those things

166
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:24,800
that are common across all houses and
then represented that it's not a

167
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:27,440
drawing.
Now if you take autistic people

168
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:31,430
sometimes and you get them to draw,
they'll start in one corner of the house

169
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,470
and what they'll draw is that helps,
like with every damn brick in place.

170
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,870
So there are autistic people,
for example,

171
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,860
who they can look at a building and they
can count every single window at one

172
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:45,860
glance.
And then there's another guy who in

173
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:48,590
England who's really famous,
this guy is just completely out of.

174
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,140
He's unbelievable.
They take them up in a helicopter and

175
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:52,730
show them a city that he's never seen.

176
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,710
Then he goes home and has a piece of
paper,

177
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:59,250
like as big as a wall and he starts in
one corner and he draws the entire city,

178
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,380
you know,
and he doesn't sketch it out,

179
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:01,950
right?
It's,

180
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,880
it's from the bottom up.
And you know,

181
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,800
that's autistic savant drawing.
And often what happens is he's very

182
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:10,860
realistic looking.
You know what happens if the autistic

183
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:15,420
drawing survivors languages,
they start being able to draw and that's

184
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,960
because the abstraction interferes with
the realism,

185
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,260
you know?
So it's really hard to draw a hand.

186
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,750
And the reason for that is if you draw a
hand,

187
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:28,080
you draw a hieroglyph the hand,
this is what heroin looks like.

188
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,290
You tried to draw your hand.
It's really strange.

189
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,950
And one of the strange things about
trying to draw your hand is that in

190
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:38,310
order to draw it,
you have to stop seeing it as if it's a

191
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,410
hand and then it pops out.

192
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,310
You think,
my God,

193
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:43,770
that's the weirdest looking thing.
It's like a tree root.

194
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:46,370
It's like you know it's a claw because
it's,

195
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,240
you know,
if you look at your hand like that,

196
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:51,870
it looks nothing like a hand.
That's how it hair looks.

197
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,870
What the hell is that?
It's like some sort of spider,

198
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:55,711
you know,
so.

199
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,990
But you have to see it that way before
you can draw it.

200
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,860
And so well.
So partly what happens is that your

201
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:06,480
capacity for abstraction interferes with
your ability to see detail and not

202
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,430
probably good.
It's one of the ways that you simplify

203
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:12,600
the world anyways.
The right hemisphere looks like it's

204
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:16,980
specialized for anomaly.
Now the way I look at it is this,

205
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:18,960
okay?
So you've got your hippocampus down

206
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:21,840
there and it's keeping track of the
comparison between what you want and

207
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:23,970
what you think is happening.
Bang,

208
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,200
something emerges.

209
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,060
It's anomalous.
You don't know what the hell is going

210
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:29,420
on,
and so you freeze.

211
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,730
That's the representation.
Then you start to feel anxious.

212
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,670
Then the right hemisphere comes up with
some pictures.

213
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,570
What might this be?
You can experience this at home for your

214
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:41,820
own enjoyment.
Let's say you're home at two in the

215
00:10:41,821 --> 00:10:44,220
morning and it's dark and you're alone.
Okay?

216
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:46,890
Maybe you've watched a horror.
Movies are all nicely pride,

217
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,350
you know,
and then you hear a noise in another

218
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:53,250
room and not knowing shouldn't be there
and so you're going to go investigate,

219
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:55,320
right?
And so let's say the door is just a

220
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,380
little bit open and it's dark in the
room and you have to put your hand in to

221
00:10:58,381 --> 00:11:00,810
turn on the light.
It's like you just watched what your

222
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:04,230
imagination populates that room with.
When you do that,

223
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,210
it's like,
you know,

224
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,470
guy with acs,
snake alligator,

225
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:08,220
like whatever.

226
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,220
But your right hemisphere is going.
There may be one of this class of

227
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:17,300
dangerous things in there and what it's
doing is basically coming up with a

228
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,190
hypothesis.
What sort of monster might be in there

229
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,700
and you're all sort of freaked out about
that even though you know that you know,

230
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,710
who knows what happened,
you know nothing.

231
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,010
Something creepy,
but you're all like on edge because your

232
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:32,520
brain doesn't work at night like it does
in the day and everyone knows that.

233
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,990
Wake up in the middle of the night.
It's like all manner of horrors go

234
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:40,140
through your imagination and that
usually happens when you're asleep.

235
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,440
You're asleep for that most of the time,
but sometimes you wake up and it's like

236
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,320
you worry about everything.
So anyways,

237
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,070
so that's the right hemisphere.
It's coming up with pictures of what

238
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:53,740
might be there and they're generally
monstrous pictures and reason for that

239
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:57,490
is while it's obvious what the reasons
for that is,

240
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,560
you know,
now you'll probably turn the light on

241
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:01,570
and look anyways,
even though you might sort of peer

242
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:03,100
around the corner and then when there's
nothing,

243
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:04,960
you'll be embarrassed about how foolish
you are.

244
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,050
But.
But you can see the instinctual behavior

245
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:09,760
right there and it's,
it's wise,

246
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,790
you know,
there's a low probability that something

247
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:17,791
terrible is there,
but zero times low probability times

248
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:23,350
infinity equals large danger.
So if there's a two percent chance that

249
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:27,430
there's a killer in there,
it pays to be a little on the 10 side

250
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:30,700
because being killed really sucks.
And so your,

251
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:33,490
your,
your prime to feel negative emotion more

252
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:34,420
intensely,
right?

253
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,040
Because you're so vulnerable.
So anyways,

254
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,050
that's kind of what the right hemisphere
is up to.

255
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:41,800
It does quick and dirty representation,
but it also does categorization.

256
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:46,720
So it's not,
it doesn't give you exactly realistic

257
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:49,750
representations of what's there.
What it does instead is gives you

258
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,110
categorical representations.
And so you might say,

259
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,840
how should you represent an unknown
danger?

260
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,490
You should use an amalgam of all known
dangers to represent it.

261
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,190
And that is what it is in a sense.

262
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,170
You know,
like that's why I talked to you earlier

263
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:07,660
about the category of all dangerous
things.

264
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,460
So the aborigines in Australia have
this,

265
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,850
this category,
which is women fire and dangerous things

266
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,351
like what you think,
well,

267
00:13:17,351 --> 00:13:19,720
why are all those things in that
category?

268
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:20,320
It's like,
oh,

269
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,270
it's not that hard to figure out if you
think about it,

270
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:25,290
but it's also a category that you very
frequently see say,

271
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:28,750
and Disney cartoons.
So the wicked queen for example,

272
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:31,690
in sleeping beauty,
I mean she's constantly bursting into

273
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:34,840
flames and turning into a dragon and no
one seems to object to that.

274
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:38,140
It makes perfect sense that the wicked
queen would turn into a fire breathing

275
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:40,120
dragon.
It's like it doesn't make any sense at

276
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:42,280
all,
but although it does,

277
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:46,450
but it's not a rational transformation.
But because it's in keeping with an

278
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,490
archetypal structure,
everybody goes,

279
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:50,500
yeah,
of course that's what she's going to do.

280
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,380
And it happens all the time.
And Disney movies like Ursula,

281
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,750
you remember her from,
from the Little Mermaid.

282
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,600
She's trying to keep her daughter from
becoming conscious.

283
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,120
Yeah.
Nice mother doing that.

284
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,830
And she trapped.
Sold Zeus,

285
00:14:02,831 --> 00:14:04,910
you know,
she squeezes it soul to death.

286
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,600
Traps them in the underworld because
he's also.

287
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,450
Well,
we won't get into that,

288
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:12,600
but anyways,
what happens to Ursula is when you find,

289
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,970
get her irritated.
Now if she grows into this huge ship

290
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,630
destroying store monster,
that's part octopus,

291
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,310
right?
Or giant octopus,

292
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:21,801
you think,
wow,

293
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:23,950
that makes sense.
Okay.

294
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,990
It doesn't make a lot of sense,
but it's a kind of hypothesis now that's

295
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:32,590
a representation of mother nature,
red in tooth and claw,

296
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,930
and there's also a reason that that's
female.

297
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,640
It's not female,
it's feminine.

298
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,920
It's actually a different thing.
So.

299
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,070
But we'll get to that.
So the right hemisphere,

300
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,650
well,
it's specialized for a.

301
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,810
normally it does quick and dirty
analysis under the influence of the

302
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:48,670
limbic system.
It's not linguistics,

303
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:53,671
so I would say it's still dominated by
the systems and my suspicion is that

304
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:56,870
animals are still dominated by the
subcortical systems.

305
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,030
Their brains worked from the bottom up.
We have a top down model and that's at

306
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:05,840
least a part of the left hemisphere
linguistic system and it's a new thing

307
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:09,260
that people have and it's based on our
capacity to abstract.

308
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,020
So that would partly be visual like here
or glyphic.

309
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,900
And then also to transform things into
linguistic form.

310
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,280
And it seems to me that that's the part
that we really identify as ourself,

311
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,110
right?
Because it's weird if you're,

312
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,100
let's say you're home alone and you get
freaked out and all these images come to

313
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:26,440
mind.
No,

314
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,030
if you think of those images is part of
you,

315
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,380
you think more.

316
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,230
There are things,
things that appeared to you and that's

317
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:36,830
what you think about your dreams.
There are things that appeared to you.

318
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:38,060
They're not you.
It's like,

319
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,360
why would you think that?
I mean they're there in your

320
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:45,740
experientials space.
Why is it that separation between you

321
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:48,050
and your dream?
I had a dream,

322
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,260
not I thought up a dream,
or look what I created.

323
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:52,910
It's like there you are.
The Observer.

324
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,530
And up comes a dream.
It's very,

325
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:57,650
very weird and you know,
it shows you that there are forces

326
00:15:57,651 --> 00:16:00,080
operating in your psyche that are
impersonal,

327
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,960
genuinely impersonal.
And of course that's part of what you

328
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:04,430
can call it,
the collective unconscious.

329
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,890
So,
and it's the thing that generates these

330
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:10,400
weird images and protects you.
So in its nature,

331
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:12,830
that's for sure.
And it can be absolutely terrifying.

332
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,750
I mean,
people can have dreams that are so

333
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:15,584
terrible that.

334
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,080
Well,
like the one my my little niece nephew

335
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:23,081
had that's pretty damn nasty little
greasy door things with big beaks.

336
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:26,840
I mean that's an ugly.
That's a very ugly representation.

337
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:30,080
And then if that wasn't bad enough,
there had to be a fire breathing dragon

338
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,510
behind them,
creating them in to this thing like it's

339
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,670
no bloody wonder.
He was waking up screaming.

340
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,020
It's like,
oh no.

341
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:39,140
I figured out what life is like.
So like at four,

342
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,420
that's pretty.
That's pretty traumatic.

343
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,490
So okay,
now the left hemisphere,

344
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,030
this is,
this is out,

345
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,340
and the goldbergs.
Hypo potts says she got one hemisphere

346
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:54,341
or system that operates when you know
what you're doing and when what you want

347
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:58,550
is happening,
and that's the happy talky part that

348
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,920
thinks it knows what the hell is going
on.

349
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,070
And then you have another part that only
turns on when you don't know what's

350
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:04,610
going on.

351
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,620
And it's full of anxiety and negative
emotion.

352
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,270
The Right Hemisphere,
by the way,

353
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:11,150
is specialized for negative emotion.
If you,

354
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,240
if you sustain right prefrontal damage,
you become inappropriately happy and you

355
00:17:16,591 --> 00:17:18,970
think you're full of positive illusions.
You Think,

356
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,450
oh,
that's an excellent thing.

357
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:23,030
It's like it's not.
You make really impulsive,

358
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:26,750
risky decisions and your life goes
directly to help because he needed the

359
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:31,040
negative emotion.
Obviously you know the reason you suffer

360
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,120
with negative emotion is because if you
didn't suffer with negative emotion use,

361
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,870
you'd suffer from being destroyed.
Those are your options.

362
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,580
There are people by the way who were
born without pain and so you think,

363
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:44,690
hey,
that's a good deal.

364
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:48,920
It's like they never last past 20 and
part of the reason for that is you don't

365
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,580
this,
but while you're sitting there,

366
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,650
you're going like this all the time,
and the reason for that is,

367
00:17:53,651 --> 00:17:58,140
is that if you sit for any length of
time on one part of your body,

368
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,060
then it doesn't get much blood and it
doesn't get oxygenated,

369
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:02,230
and so you do that.

370
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,950
A bitch is a little bit little pain,
so you shift,

371
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,430
you shift and you shift and so you're
just doing this all the time because

372
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:11,760
otherwise you wear out your damn body or
you get bedsores or that sort of thing.

373
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:13,620
Well these people that don't have any
pain,

374
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,440
they just wear themselves out.
So.

375
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,930
So you need the negative emotion,
you know,

376
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,810
it keeps you going and,
and it can get out of hand and have its

377
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:22,980
own pathologies,
but,

378
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,730
but it's definitely necessary.
So the right hemisphere does negative

379
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:30,420
emotion inhibition of behavior.
That's the freezing and its attendant on

380
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:33,900
anxiety does image processing,
holistic thinking.

381
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:37,230
So it's the quick and dirty hemisphere
pattern recognition,

382
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,930
pattern generation and gross motor
action not.

383
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:41,160
It's interesting too,
right?

384
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,550
Because the gross motor action is again,
the quick and dirty stuff.

385
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,310
You know,
if you need to slap something away,

386
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,970
it doesn't really matter that it's a,
you know,

387
00:18:49,971 --> 00:18:51,360
a gross motor gesture.

388
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,940
You don't have to go like this and be
precise.

389
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:57,390
It can just be fast and sloppy and it'll
still work.

390
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,320
Now the left hemisphere is specialized
for when you know what the hell's going

391
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:05,520
on and you can concentrate on the
details so and then you can think about

392
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:07,770
it in terms of the hierarchy that we
discussed,

393
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:11,130
right?
So what it implies is that at the level

394
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:16,131
of specific fine detailed motor output,
the left hemisphere is operating and so

395
00:19:16,231 --> 00:19:18,480
that's kind of associated with positive
affect.

396
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:21,630
I know exactly what I'm doing and I'm
making minor adjustments and

397
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:24,540
everything's going well,
and then if you go up the hierarchy

398
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:28,080
towards more and more abstract
representations,

399
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:31,650
then increasingly that's moving over
into right hemisphere space.

400
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,450
And so that's also partly why when you
disrupt those higher order structures

401
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,450
that well literally all hell breaks
loose.

402
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,680
So left hemisphere operation,
unexplored territory,

403
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:45,810
positive emotion,
activation of behavior.

404
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,530
So that's also exploration,
a word processing,

405
00:19:49,531 --> 00:19:51,780
linear thinking,
detail recognition,

406
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,420
detailed generation and fine motor
action.

407
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,260
So you need one system that works when
you don't know what's going on and you

408
00:19:58,261 --> 00:20:00,150
need another system that works when you
do,

409
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,750
because sometimes your where you don't
know what you're doing and sometimes

410
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:05,130
your where you do know what you're
doing.

411
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,550
Now Ramachandra,
who's a fairly famous neurologist who

412
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:13,551
operates out of La,
he associated that totalitarian eagle

413
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:15,900
with hyper domination of the left
hemisphere.

414
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,540
And the reason he did that,
it's very cool.

415
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:24,030
So he's got these patients that have a.
what's it called?

416
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,750
He said Agnosia.
It isn't.

417
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,750
We'll call it neglect.
Neglect.

418
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:31,980
Okay,
so this is what happens.

419
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,320
Okay?
You have a stroke and the stroke affects

420
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,870
the back part of the right hemisphere.
All right?

421
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,180
So what happens?
Your left side is paralyzed.

422
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,400
You can't do anything with it.

423
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,710
Okay?
So however you also don't notice that

424
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:50,230
it's not working.
And so one of the things you might do if

425
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:52,390
you do become aware,
you're laying in bed,

426
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:55,420
you've had a stroke,
and for some reason you noticed that

427
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,690
there's an arm lying in there with you
and then what you do is you pick it up

428
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:01,450
with your other hand and you try to
throw it out of the bed and when you

429
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:04,120
find out that it's attached to you
because it's not your arm,

430
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,120
you're not very happy,
or maybe you throw yourself right out of

431
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:09,370
bed.
And then if someone gets you to draw a

432
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,860
clock,
you draw half a clock and if you eat a

433
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:14,380
plate full of food,
you eat half the plate unless someone

434
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:18,730
turns it and then you eat half of that
and so half the world is gone.

435
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,220
It's hard to imagine what that would be
liking.

436
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,060
But I think what it's sort of like is,
you know how there's a whole world

437
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:29,200
behind you and you don't,
you don't detect it as not there.

438
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,740
Like it's not black or anything.
Like when your eyes are closed,

439
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,010
it's just not there.
And I think what happens with people

440
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:41,011
with neglect is that the not there
becomes three quarters instead of just

441
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,360
half.
It's something like that anyways.

442
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,450
So fine.
So you don't know what's going on.

443
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:49,090
And there you are like this and someone
says to you,

444
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,360
I noticed that you can't move your left
arm today.

445
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:53,710
And what do you say?
You say,

446
00:21:53,711 --> 00:21:57,100
well that's because I'm tired.
Or you say I'm,

447
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,550
I don't feel like moving it and,
and so forth.

448
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:03,130
So you'll have this reason that you're
not going to move it.

449
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,170
And you know,
you might say the same thing about the

450
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:06,160
left foot or whatever.

451
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,701
It's like,
yeah,

452
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:09,820
well I don't feel like moving it.
Then you'll have some story about why

453
00:22:09,821 --> 00:22:11,320
you're not going to move it.
Okay.

454
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:14,680
So that's fine.
So for Indians thought about that as

455
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:19,090
traumatic denial,
you know that it was so overwhelming to

456
00:22:19,091 --> 00:22:21,610
you that you lost the left part of your
body,

457
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,610
that you couldn't face it and you just
denied it happened.

458
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,770
It's not a bad theory.
It's not quite right.

459
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:28,870
But it's not a bad theory.
So,

460
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,160
so fine.
So I'll tell you a couple of associated

461
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:35,200
stories.
Let's say you're on dialysis.

462
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,620
That sucks.
You have to have this big thing in your

463
00:22:38,621 --> 00:22:42,250
arm that's like a shunt and then you
have to go get hooked up to a dialysis

464
00:22:42,251 --> 00:22:45,310
machine like all the time because your
kidneys are failing.

465
00:22:45,311 --> 00:22:47,290
And so who wants that?
Nobody.

466
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:50,200
So everybody thinks time for a kidney
transplant.

467
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:53,950
So then they're on a long waiting list,
make it one kidney that's not very many

468
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:54,784
kidneys.

469
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,370
And so then they say,
okay,

470
00:22:57,371 --> 00:22:59,500
you got your kidney.
And everyone's thrilled about that.

471
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:03,760
Here's your antirejection medication,
make sure you take it and so then a year

472
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,470
later you lose your kidney.
Why?

473
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,130
Because you don't take your damn
antirejection medication.

474
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:10,690
That's the most common reason you might
think,

475
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:12,340
well,
why in the world would you not take your

476
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:15,850
antirejection medication?
While the Freud's would say denial?

477
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,130
Here's a different hypothesis.
You're a whole map of you is person with

478
00:23:21,131 --> 00:23:25,870
kidney and then you lose your kidneys
and it's like you're a whole weird thing

479
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:29,680
that you have no idea about and it's
virtually impossible for you to update

480
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:31,600
your model and you think,
well,

481
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:32,980
does that make any sense?
Like,

482
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,620
have you ever lost a tooth?
Right?

483
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,750
What is your tongue do for like six
months?

484
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,380
You're sitting there in your tongue is
like fiddling away in there like a mad

485
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:46,381
dog investigating every nook and like
it's an obsessive exploratory device and

486
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:51,980
it doesn't even when you don't want it
to and then six months later you get

487
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:53,360
your mouth remapped.

488
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:58,310
So that's just a tooth man.
Lose a kidney and see what happens or

489
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,200
lose the whole left side of your body.
It's like,

490
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:02,150
what are you going to do about that?
Well,

491
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,970
okay,
so then Ramachandra and he's testing

492
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:09,971
these people for balance and so what he
does is he checks out this phenomena

493
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:15,320
called Nystagmus.
And so if you pour cold water in

494
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:17,450
someone's ear,
their eyes move back and forth because

495
00:24:17,451 --> 00:24:19,320
it screws up the,
um,

496
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,950
you know,
you have a balanced system in your,

497
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,550
in your ear.
And if you pour cold water and air it

498
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,600
screws it up and then your eyes move
back and forth.

499
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:28,070
And you know,
it's not very pleasant.

500
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,900
So what he found was that if he poured
water in the cold water in the left ear,

501
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,540
then all of a sudden the people would
wake up and go,

502
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,090
oh my God,
I don't have the left side of my body.

503
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,880
And then they would have a catastrophic
emotional experience,

504
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:43,080
may be all upset about it and crying
away,

505
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,900
which is of course what they should do.
And then 20 minutes later it would wear

506
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:49,400
off and then you'd say,
well,

507
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:50,870
you know,
is there anything wrong with your left

508
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,681
side?
And they'd say,

509
00:24:51,681 --> 00:24:53,300
well yeah,
I just don't feel like moving it.

510
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,000
So,
so what seems to have happened is

511
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:59,870
something like,
so there's a body representation center,

512
00:24:59,871 --> 00:25:04,040
let's say in the back of the right
hemisphere and you blow that soccer out

513
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:07,790
with a stroke and that means you can't
represent that part of your body

514
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:10,400
anymore,
but maybe there's tatters of it left.

515
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:14,540
Like it's like a network that's damaged
and under some conditions you could more

516
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:17,630
or less get it to operate.
So you pour some cold water in the year,

517
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,140
you shocked the whole system.
And then there's enough neurological

518
00:25:21,141 --> 00:25:21,890
activity.

519
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,580
So the network kicks in even though it's
damaged for like 10 minutes.

520
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,060
And then you get this tremendous burst
of negative emotion,

521
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:31,190
which is what the right hemisphere
should be doing.

522
00:25:31,191 --> 00:25:34,670
When you lose half your body and you
experienced that and will left

523
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:37,490
hemisphere is like flapping away trying
to account for this,

524
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:41,600
which it can't because it's such a
massive archer catastrophe.

525
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,940
But then you know,
the,

526
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,390
the shock wears off and bang,
the system shuts back down and Poof,

527
00:25:47,391 --> 00:25:51,020
you're back in denial.
So that's a good example of the

528
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:53,450
relationship between the left hemisphere
and right hemisphere.

529
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:56,900
The left hemisphere has a fixed idea
about the world.

530
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,760
So in some sense you might think about
it as the instantiation of your latest

531
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:04,340
Avatar.
Even certainly see that with people who

532
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:05,930
are ideological,
he possessed,

533
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,570
right?
They've got this verbal system that

534
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:12,620
accounts for the whole world and there's
just no damn way that things go in

535
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:13,100
anywhere.

536
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,740
So you know,
and it's got this totalitarian aspect

537
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,800
because it wants to explain every last
thing.

538
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,360
It doesn't like to normally at all.
It hasn't come to terms with the

539
00:26:22,361 --> 00:26:26,630
normally at all and there's no sense of
transformation within the system,

540
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,450
which is partly white totalitarian
systems die.

541
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:34,550
It's like the Red Queen says to Alice in
wonderland when she was in the

542
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,640
underworld and my kingdom,
you have to run as fast as you can just

543
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:41,240
to say in the same place.
That's why totalitarian systems don't

544
00:26:41,241 --> 00:26:44,450
work is because the damn environment
shifting around on,

545
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,800
you know,
and if they are fixed in place,

546
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,390
the gap between their theory and reality
gets larger and larger and larger and

547
00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:52,620
larger.
Until finally,

548
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,770
you know they fall into a pit and that's
the end of it.

549
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,280
So now it's what happens to people too.
If they don't stay updated,

550
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:01,320
you know,
if they let things get away on them,

551
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,740
eventually the ignored reality comes
flooding back and we'll see that

552
00:27:07,531 --> 00:27:11,130
represented in mythology because it's
represented very nicely and mythology.

553
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,780
That's where I often dragons in
fairytales,

554
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,700
for example,
in the St George Story and in the

555
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:18,540
Hobbit,
for that matter,

556
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:23,070
the dragon is an eternal thing.
It lives underneath the earth and most

557
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:24,690
of the time it leaves you the hell
alone,

558
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,160
but now and then it comes back and it
tries to destroy the city and then you

559
00:27:29,161 --> 00:27:32,310
have to zip out there and fight the
thing so you get to go back and it's

560
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:35,790
whole and maybe you get the treasure
that it's caring and then it's back in

561
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:38,130
the hole for a while,
but that thing's coming back.

562
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:42,420
It's always coming back and so you build
the walls and all that,

563
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,840
that's fine,
but a dragon can destroy any walls and

564
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:48,750
so walls aren't enough.
You have to be prepared to go out there

565
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:51,960
and fight the damn thing,
and that's how you keep it at bay and

566
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,600
you know,
that basically means that you have to

567
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:57,090
maintain everything you build.
It's something like that,

568
00:27:57,091 --> 00:27:59,160
right?
Because otherwise it falls apart with

569
00:27:59,161 --> 00:28:00,960
increasing entropy.
So,

570
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,210
all right,
so

571
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,290
Goldberg thought about this as an
anomaly system and offy system and a

572
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,600
route and ization system.
But I tended to think about it more from

573
00:28:16,601 --> 00:28:18,790
an anthropological or,
uh,

574
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,730
um,
uh,

575
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,890
what would you call it?
A ecological perspective,

576
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,190
thinking about an animal.
US In our natural environment,

577
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,250
it's not so much novelty versus root
analyzation.

578
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,250
It's explored versus unexplored
territory.

579
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,340
And that's what the world's made out of.
It's made out of,

580
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:41,290
explored versus unexplored territory.
And so there's a domain that you inhabit

581
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:44,830
which is the center of the universe from
a mythological perspective with you,

582
00:28:44,831 --> 00:28:49,831
right in the middle of it and around you
is this circle of which is your place

583
00:28:50,081 --> 00:28:52,720
that you move around with you.
And in that circle you know what the

584
00:28:52,721 --> 00:28:56,110
hell's going on.
And that's partly because you've mapped

585
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:58,810
it,
but it's also partly because you don't

586
00:28:58,811 --> 00:29:00,370
go outside of it,
you know,

587
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:04,090
so you have your friends and you have
your routine and that's nested inside

588
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:08,440
your culture and you try to keep that
thing from flipping upside down and you

589
00:29:08,441 --> 00:29:12,730
do that all sorts of ways partly by
doing the same thing all the time,

590
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,940
but also partly by refusing to go
anywhere that might seriously challenge

591
00:29:17,951 --> 00:29:18,650
your beliefs.

592
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,630
And you know,
fair enough,

593
00:29:19,631 --> 00:29:23,110
you can understand that although it
makes you weak to do that because you're

594
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:25,870
not as prepared as you might be.
So you could say,

595
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,820
you know,
human beings are tribal,

596
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:34,000
social animals that have a territory and
the territory.

597
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,280
Then you think,
well what's the territory while let's

598
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:39,130
say tree dwelling chimp,
ancestors,

599
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,330
territories,
the jungle.

600
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:40,871
It's like,
no,

601
00:29:40,871 --> 00:29:43,660
it's,
it's not the territory.

602
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,760
The territory is a little bit of the
jungle plus the things that come in from

603
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:54,280
outside plus the primate dominance
hierarchy that exists in that area.

604
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,750
Right,
right.

605
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,970
So that's the,
that's the territory.

606
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,760
That's the environment,
you know,

607
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,760
because for mythological reasons,
we tend to make a separation between the

608
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:07,210
environment and culture,
but it's yes,

609
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,080
makes sense at one level of analysis,
but at another level of analysis,

610
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:15,910
all it does is screw you up because your
territory fundamentally isn't the world,

611
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,070
not the natural objective world.

612
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,980
You want to stay as far away from that
thing as you possibly can.

613
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:26,340
Your territory is that circle of people
with whom you spend 90 percent of your

614
00:30:26,651 --> 00:30:31,450
time and so if you're a gym for example,
or some other kind of monkey,

615
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,910
highly social,
what do you do all day?

616
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,710
You sleep,
you eat,

617
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,780
your chew leaves.
If you're a chip and you grew mother

618
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:43,720
gyms like it's constantly social
interaction and you're jockeying for

619
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:48,280
position in the dominance hierarchy like
mean girls and not in that movie.

620
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,650
You know,
and you're mapping out the social

621
00:30:50,651 --> 00:30:52,900
territory,
knowing who's who and what's what,

622
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:55,120
and then trying to get up somewhere near
the top.

623
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:58,060
And that's your environment.
That's your environment.

624
00:30:58,061 --> 00:31:00,430
And so your,
your,

625
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,480
your world is that social natural
circle,

626
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,150
which is a four dimensional territory
because it's,

627
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,650
you know,
what's going length,

628
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:14,200
width and height,
plus it stretches across time.

629
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:17,680
So it's this transforming natural
entity.

630
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:22,060
And then inside that there's a pyramid
and the pyramid is made out of all the

631
00:31:22,061 --> 00:31:25,180
primates that you interact with.
And that's the world.

632
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:29,200
A circle with a pyramid on it.
Now I'll give you a vision.

633
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:31,810
This vision I had once when I was trying
to figure this stuff out.

634
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:33,040
Okay?
So what is the world?

635
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,520
So imagine that there's a field in front
of you that stretches as far as you can

636
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:40,920
see.
Okay.

637
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,740
And then you're flying above it.
And what you see everywhere are these

638
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:47,440
pyramids,
let's say for the sake of argument that

639
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:49,690
they're like skyscrapers made out of
glass.

640
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:53,560
There's peers,
tears in them and you fly down and one's

641
00:31:53,561 --> 00:31:55,720
here and one's here.
And some of them overlap and some of

642
00:31:55,721 --> 00:32:00,040
them are really big and some of them are
small and like they're just everywhere.

643
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:03,610
And you're flying around above them and
you fly close enough to look inside.

644
00:32:03,611 --> 00:32:07,750
And what you see inside them are people
all packed together trying to scramble

645
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:10,000
up to the top.
And that's the world.

646
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,670
That's the reality.
And the funny thing is,

647
00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:14,710
is that you can be in one of those
pyramids,

648
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:16,870
crap,
clambering away to the top or you can be

649
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:20,080
flying above it.
Those are your options and if you have

650
00:32:20,081 --> 00:32:22,180
to choose,
you should be flying above it.

651
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:27,520
And so the relationship between the self
and the Ego Avatar is the same as the

652
00:32:27,521 --> 00:32:31,960
relationship between the thing that is
flying above and the thing that's within

653
00:32:31,961 --> 00:32:34,450
one of those pyramids trying to scramble
to the top,

654
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,501
you know,
you say,

655
00:32:35,501 --> 00:32:38,620
well I'm going to get to the top,
top of what?

656
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,500
There's 100 talks,
there's 200 talks and then you might

657
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:44,150
say,
is there anything above the top?

658
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,103
Well,
there is.

659
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:51,350
There's this part of you that isn't
entrapped within that particular system.

660
00:32:51,351 --> 00:32:55,190
And that can move from place to place.
If you look at Egypt mythology,

661
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,860
so you know,
you see on the back of the American

662
00:32:57,861 --> 00:32:59,870
dollar bill,
that's a symbol of value,

663
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:00,710
right?
Okay.

664
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:04,010
So what's The pyramid?
There's a pyramid on it,

665
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,870
right?
What's the top of the pyramid?

666
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,330
It's the triangle separate from the
pyramid.

667
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,720
There's an ID inside it.
That's because the top of the pyramid is

668
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:14,420
an IRA and it's separate from the
pyramid.

669
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,640
And what that means fundamentally is
that

670
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,960
the thing that transcends the structure
is attention,

671
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,330
voluntary attention.
Now,

672
00:33:25,331 --> 00:33:28,930
the Egyptians worshiped voluntary
attention in the form of Horace

673
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:29,771
[inaudible].
He was,

674
00:33:29,771 --> 00:33:30,670
uh,
he was gone,

675
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,593
right?
Horace.

676
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,280
And I'll tell you about horace and
detail,

677
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:38,550
but one of Horus is avatars was the
fault and the reason for that is falcons

678
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:40,600
can really,
really,

679
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,180
really,
really see and they fly around.

680
00:33:43,181 --> 00:33:44,850
And so they're like the king's eyes,
like,

681
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,220
like the little bird zoo in,
uh,

682
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,970
in the lion king,
right?

683
00:33:48,971 --> 00:33:52,240
He was the king's eyes to thing that
flies around the boat and he was a

684
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:56,510
particular enemy of scar scar.
Eat some at the beginning and then spits

685
00:33:56,511 --> 00:33:59,350
them out.
And the reason that the king's eyes is

686
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:02,770
an enemy of scars because the king's
eyes can see what he is,

687
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,230
right?
And he's the eternal forest that works

688
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:07,750
to disrupt the kingdom and bring
everything into ruin.

689
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,990
Classic myth.
Classic Grantham.

690
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:15,060
Partly accounting for why that was the
largest selling highest grossing cartoon

691
00:34:15,311 --> 00:34:16,510
in Disney history.
Right.

692
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:20,620
They got from mythology pretty right.
So okay,

693
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:27,090
so attention.
Oh,

694
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:30,230
okay,
well we'll do this.

695
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:33,140
So you might say what's a human being
like?

696
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,910
Remember I told you that when Penfield
was mapping the brain,

697
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:45,280
he was poking people and you can either
poke them along the sensory strip,

698
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:50,850
which is if the motor strip is here,
the sensory strip is just behind it and

699
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:55,480
the motor strip is where the motor
systems of your body are represented in

700
00:34:55,481 --> 00:34:59,410
so far as you can control them.
And the sensory strip is where the

701
00:34:59,411 --> 00:35:03,290
sensory systems are represented in so
far as you can feel them.

702
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,760
So what this is is a that the bar is
laid out weirdly on the motor cortex.

703
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:14,320
One of the things that's pretty funny is
that the Genitalia area in the sensory

704
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,000
Cortex,
it's right beside the feet.

705
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,850
And so I think you know,
there's,

706
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,620
that's why people have foot fetishes and
love massages,

707
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:24,400
foot massages is because they're
spreading activation from the foot area

708
00:35:24,401 --> 00:35:26,860
to the general area and God only knows
why that is.

709
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,370
Maybe because you had to have really
sensitive feet to tromp around without

710
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,740
stepping on horrible things,
whatever.

711
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,730
So you can,
you can put this weird stretched out

712
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:42,150
body representation together in a,
in a representational form like this.

713
00:35:42,151 --> 00:35:43,960
And they called that the whole monkey
plus,

714
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,890
which is the like the little man that
exists inside your brain.

715
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,440
So what you see that's the motor
Homunculus,

716
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,990
not the sensory Homonculus,
but what?

717
00:35:51,991 --> 00:35:53,010
So what do you see?
What?

718
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:55,230
What's a person as far as brain is
concerned?

719
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,300
Well,
hand,

720
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,260
that's for sure.
Thumb,

721
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:02,640
that's for sure.
It's like your thumb is represented as

722
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:06,060
your whole body and it's because your,
your,

723
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,390
your chest,
your torsos hardly represented at all is

724
00:36:09,391 --> 00:36:10,500
why is that?
It's like,

725
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,540
well,
how many things do you manipulate with

726
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:14,580
your chest?
Like none.

727
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,773
Right?
So you don't,

728
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,770
you don't have motor control over it.
So it's not represented so.

729
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,690
But the hands man,
those things,

730
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:26,691
they're represented like mad and so is
the face and the lips and the tongue and

731
00:36:26,761 --> 00:36:29,730
there's a bunch of reasons for that.
One is that when you're an infant,

732
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,540
you explored like mad with your mouth,
but you do that through your whole life

733
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:35,760
because when you eat,
you know what it's like.

734
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:38,880
If you're eating something and there's a
bit of sand in it like you,

735
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,050
you find it and you take it out.
It's like you can detect this teeny

736
00:36:43,051 --> 00:36:46,770
little thing that's not supposed to be
in your mouth and while that's a good

737
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,900
thing because lots of things aren't
supposed to be in your mouth.

738
00:36:48,901 --> 00:36:52,020
So that's part of the reason.
Then the other part of the reason is,

739
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,910
well,
think about what you do with your

740
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,980
tongue.
I mean there's a lot of things you do

741
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:56,814
with your tongue.

742
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,400
Some of them are eating,
some of them are talking,

743
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,460
some of them are all sorts of intimate
behaviors.

744
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:06,810
That thing is wired up and it's wired up
right at birth and then it's the same

745
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:09,120
with your lips and your and the rest of
your mouth.

746
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:14,280
You use that to communicate so your
hands will wander around taking the

747
00:37:14,281 --> 00:37:16,110
world apart and putting it back
together,

748
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:19,650
which is exactly what your brain does
and then you blab about what you're

749
00:37:19,651 --> 00:37:23,940
doing to everyone and that's basically a
human being and I like to think of this

750
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:28,770
thing is it's sort of the.
It's a comical representation of the

751
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:30,930
hero that goes out to confront the
world,

752
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:33,060
right?
Because the hero has two elements.

753
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:37,180
One is explore
and that sort of what?

754
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:40,530
That's where the West is powerful.
I would say like we have a really well

755
00:37:40,531 --> 00:37:42,990
developed mythology of the exploratory
hero,

756
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,680
but where we're not so well developed as
the second part because in the second

757
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:50,670
part of the classic Hero's story,
you're supposed to come back and

758
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:55,671
communicate about what you found and so
there's a individual exploration element

759
00:37:56,281 --> 00:37:58,380
and then there's a communicate and
update.

760
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,280
The culture element and both of those
are equally important and it's something

761
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:05,610
that we don't do well.
We don't have much respect for tradition

762
00:38:05,611 --> 00:38:09,930
in the west and it's a really,
really big problem because the ethical

763
00:38:09,931 --> 00:38:13,680
responsibility of a human being is to
take the dead culture,

764
00:38:13,681 --> 00:38:16,590
so that's the dead father or the dead
God,

765
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:21,570
and to revivify it with attention and
communication and you've failed to do

766
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:23,960
that.
Then everything disappears and we,

767
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:27,300
we are failing to do that.
We're leaving it all behind instead.

768
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,880
It's not a good idea.
You know,

769
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,420
if the old gods die,
as Nietzsche said,

770
00:38:33,421 --> 00:38:38,380
they had new gods in very rapidly and if
you think the old guard was bad,

771
00:38:38,381 --> 00:38:40,480
you wait till the new gods get ahold of
you.

772
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:44,800
So while we saw what happened in the
20th century,

773
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:46,900
right,
with all the ideologies that sprang up

774
00:38:46,901 --> 00:38:49,060
in the absence of classical religious
belief,

775
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:50,080
it's like,
okay,

776
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,300
you're not so thrilled with Catholicism.

777
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,880
If you think about that as,
you know,

778
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:56,410
the fundamental tradition of the West,
you know,

779
00:38:56,411 --> 00:38:58,720
with the witch burnings and the
inquisition and all that,

780
00:38:58,721 --> 00:38:59,260
it's like,
yeah,

781
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,240
yeah,
well get a load of the Nazis and then

782
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:05,050
see what you think.
So or the communists for that matter,

783
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:10,380
it's like
from bad to worse in an unimaginable

784
00:39:11,381 --> 00:39:12,131
way,
you know,

785
00:39:12,131 --> 00:39:16,270
so and that's partly because those
archaic systems,

786
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,910
those are religious systems,
they weren't ideologies.

787
00:39:18,911 --> 00:39:23,020
There are a whole different class of
thing and we don't understand them very

788
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:26,620
well and it's not good because you
cannot live without understanding them.

789
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:30,400
You don't know who you are.
And then you fall prey to weird mental

790
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,180
diseases like nihilism.
That's,

791
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,510
that's one.
And the other one is ideological

792
00:39:34,511 --> 00:39:37,150
possession.
So you become a totalitarian or a

793
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,660
analyst and that's a bad outcome and you
might think,

794
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:41,860
well,
what's the alternative?

795
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,320
Well,
you know what happens in Pinocchio,

796
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:45,520
right?
You've watched Pinocchio.

797
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,530
Okay.
I often show up in oak you to this

798
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:48,970
class,
but I don't know if I'm going to do that

799
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:50,170
this year.
But anyways,

800
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:54,390
but now he's a puppet marionette.
Someone else's pulling his strings has.

801
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:56,410
It wouldn't hit.
He's not very bright.

802
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,180
He hasn't banged around the world at
all.

803
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,330
He's got a good father.
The old Japan who really would,

804
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:03,310
rather than he was a real boy,
right?

805
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:05,770
A real person.
So he's the kind of father that wants to

806
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:09,550
produce an individual and not a slave.
So,

807
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:10,490
and that's why,
you know,

808
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,720
in his workshop it's all friendly and
there's a nice fire and he's making toys

809
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:15,590
and there's lots of music.
It's like go Japan.

810
00:40:15,591 --> 00:40:16,540
Oh,
he's a good guy.

811
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,260
So it makes this little puppet and he
sends them out in the world,

812
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,920
says,
go be a real boy.

813
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,790
Well,
Pinocchio runs into a whole class of

814
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:26,740
different obstacles.
One is evil,

815
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,060
right?
That's the,

816
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:29,830
uh,
that's the coachman.

817
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,170
And uh,
the Italian stereotype guy who makes him

818
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:37,960
a dancing puppets celebrity,
which I think is pretty funny.

819
00:40:37,961 --> 00:40:41,560
I mean,
that's really prescient because you

820
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:42,161
might think,
well,

821
00:40:42,161 --> 00:40:44,830
what's the goal of your typical
boneheaded,

822
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,340
you know,
mid adolescent in North America.

823
00:40:48,341 --> 00:40:50,350
It's like unearned celebrity.
Well,

824
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:52,600
that's exactly what Pinocchio goes for
first.

825
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,390
And that doesn't work out so well
because he ends up a slave.

826
00:40:55,391 --> 00:41:00,370
And then the next thing that happens is
he capitalizes on the fact that he's

827
00:41:00,371 --> 00:41:03,460
vulnerable and pretends he's sick and
goes off for a vacation under the

828
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,850
direction of the coachman who's
basically Satan in disguise.

829
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,580
And it goes out to treasure island,
pleasure island,

830
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,780
and meets all the delinquent.
So we're just like Nazis.

831
00:41:12,781 --> 00:41:16,690
And it turns out that in fact,
the whole ploys to enslave everyone,

832
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:20,560
to deprive them of their voice,
that's the donkey's brain and to make

833
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,200
them into slaves pretty damn horrifying.

834
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,600
And that was,
that movie came out about the same time

835
00:41:25,601 --> 00:41:27,360
that the Nazis were really,
you know,

836
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,240
grasping power in,
in central Europe.

837
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:35,210
It's like they got it exactly right.
Here's what's really going on behind the

838
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:36,530
scenes.
So.

839
00:41:36,531 --> 00:41:37,580
And then what happens?
Well,

840
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:40,370
Pinocchio turns halfway into a brain
donkey because,

841
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,470
you know,
he's gone off the path and in order to

842
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:44,750
get back on it,
he tries to go home,

843
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,820
but it's too late.
He's grown up.

844
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:48,860
You can't go home.
He's not a kid anymore.

845
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:51,010
Goes home and dad,
isn't there surprised,

846
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:53,450
surprised?
Because once you grow up and you go

847
00:41:53,451 --> 00:41:55,220
home,
dad isn't there.

848
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:59,000
It's just another human being.
So then what happens?

849
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:02,090
Well then he has to go into the ocean.
Now that's particularly weird,

850
00:42:02,091 --> 00:42:02,924
right?
It's like,

851
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,130
there he is,
half donkey.

852
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:07,490
He's a puppet.
The dove comes down and drops him a

853
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:08,900
message from God.

854
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:12,650
It's like the Holy Spirit descending,
except it's actually from the blue fairy

855
00:42:12,651 --> 00:42:15,740
weirdly enough,
and the message says you have to go to

856
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,020
the deepest part of the ocean and rescue
your father.

857
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:18,831
It's like,
yeah,

858
00:42:18,831 --> 00:42:22,340
that is what you have to do.
If you don't want to be a bloody puppet

859
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,250
donkey,
you have to go down into the depths and

860
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:28,460
find your dead father and you have to
revivify him.

861
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,700
And that's what happened.
So Pinocchio goes way down there to the

862
00:42:31,701 --> 00:42:35,120
deepest depths and finds monster who's a
monster.

863
00:42:35,121 --> 00:42:38,750
So terrible that the fish swim away just
at the sound of his voice,

864
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,400
just like,
what's his name?

865
00:42:40,401 --> 00:42:44,780
Uh,
he who shall not be named Voldemort,

866
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,270
right?
You can't even say his damn name.

867
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:50,120
Same with monster.
Put occhio goes down there.

868
00:42:50,121 --> 00:42:54,320
It goes into the whale.
What happens in Japan?

869
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,420
Oh,
says there's no getting out with this.

870
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:59,060
There's no getting out of this.
We just have to sit here and Cook Fish

871
00:42:59,061 --> 00:42:59,990
and Pinocchio.
Thanks.

872
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,510
Cook.
And then he starts breaking up all the

873
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:05,130
chairs and everything.
And as far as freaking out,

874
00:43:05,131 --> 00:43:05,910
it's like,
what do you do?

875
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,730
Breaking all these chairs?
What are we going to sit on?

876
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:11,090
And then Pinocchio Lights them on fire.
He's a master of fire.

877
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:14,500
It's a shamonic ritual,
but he is a master of fire.

878
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,150
That's where human being is.
He,

879
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,510
he gets everything burning.
Of course,

880
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:22,190
pedal was all freaked out about that
because what are they going to sit on

881
00:43:22,191 --> 00:43:24,260
and Pinocchio thinks,
who cares about sitting?

882
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:26,780
We're going to solve the problem once
and for all.

883
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,810
And so then the whale turns into a fire
breathing dragon,

884
00:43:29,811 --> 00:43:31,880
which is pretty damn weird thing for a
whale to do.

885
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:34,000
Half Kills Pinocchio.
He lived,

886
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,640
washes up on shore dead,
but he saves his father.

887
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,950
And then at the very end of the movie,
he's lying on his bed,

888
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,290
all drowned.
They're all like having a show.

889
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:44,270
He's a dead pop it now.
It's like,

890
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:45,550
do you want to be alive?
Popular?

891
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:46,940
A dead puppet?
Well,

892
00:43:46,941 --> 00:43:49,350
maybe the dead puppet is better than the
live property.

893
00:43:49,351 --> 00:43:51,920
It depends on where you're going.
So then he's on the bed.

894
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:53,570
The blue fairy comes down and says,
well,

895
00:43:53,571 --> 00:43:56,870
you've been honest and courageous bag.
Now you're real.

896
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,360
You know,
and then they have a little party and

897
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:01,730
that's,
that's just exactly right.

898
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,260
Got that.
Exactly right.

899
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,670
So that's how.
That's part of the hero mythology is the

900
00:44:07,671 --> 00:44:10,550
rescuing of the father,
the father,

901
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:18,180
because otherwise you're a corpse like
you're a historical creature.

902
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,960
You're cultural creature.
You're a.

903
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:27,260
You cannot live without your culture.
You think you can,

904
00:44:27,261 --> 00:44:30,650
but you can't.
It disappears in and you don't even

905
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,070
look.
I'll give you an example.

906
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:35,790
In the Mesopotamian creation myth,
which I'm going to tell you about next

907
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:38,370
week,
one of the things that happens is that

908
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:42,300
the first round of gods,
so they're like primordial forces.

909
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:47,310
They're pretty damn careless and they
killed their father and they make this

910
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,530
place to live on his corpse.
Okay?

911
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:53,550
That's where we live.
We live on the corpse of our ancestors

912
00:44:53,551 --> 00:44:55,740
because we live in this society.
It's dead.

913
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:58,770
It's the product of dead people.
So it's got this dead element,

914
00:44:58,771 --> 00:45:00,600
but we're living on it.
Okay?

915
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:02,640
They're very careless.
They kill it.

916
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:05,700
They render it completely dead.
Well,

917
00:45:05,701 --> 00:45:09,030
what happens is Taya Matt,
who's the mother of chaos,

918
00:45:09,031 --> 00:45:11,400
she comes flooding back and she thinks,
oh,

919
00:45:11,401 --> 00:45:13,530
you killed the thing that protects you.

920
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,710
You just wait to see what happens and
that's exactly.

921
00:45:16,711 --> 00:45:18,660
Yet you killed the thing that structures
you.

922
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,030
You will know it.
It's like niches,

923
00:45:21,031 --> 00:45:24,270
prediction from the death of God.
It's like you killed this.

924
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,370
You think are.
It doesn't make any difference.

925
00:45:26,371 --> 00:45:27,330
It's like,
Huh,

926
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:30,960
wrong.
It's like the striders protecting the

927
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:33,390
hobbits.
You get rid of that thing that protects

928
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:35,550
you in chaos,
comes flooding in and you like.

929
00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:38,430
You have no idea what's possible.
We do though,

930
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,020
because we lived through the 20th
century,

931
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,840
we know exactly what's possible.
You know,

932
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,870
hundreds of millions of unnecessary
deaths.

933
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,480
That's what's possible.
We're lucky we didn't blow the whole

934
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:53,280
damn thing up so and we still could.
So people pursuing their dead

935
00:45:53,281 --> 00:45:56,250
etiologies.
You don't rescue the dead father.

936
00:45:56,251 --> 00:46:00,930
You're the puppet of death.
That's what you are already on.

937
00:46:00,931 --> 00:46:01,800
That cheery note.
