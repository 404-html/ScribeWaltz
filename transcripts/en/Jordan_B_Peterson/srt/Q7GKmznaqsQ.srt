1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,300
Okay,

2
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,760
this is the most practical of all the 
things that we've discussed so far.

3
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,880
Um,
it's really,

4
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,240
you could consider it a component of 
industrial organizational psychology,

5
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:26,074
but it's a component that has a strong 
emphasis on individual differences and 

6
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:31,294
so you could consider it
first an exploration of the practical 

7
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:44,010
utility of psychological concepts in 
predicting real world phenomena,

8
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,053
but you could also consider it a part of
the validation of the psychometric 

9
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:51,720
models of personality that we've 
described because one of the things that

10
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:55,380
you want to do to determine whether or 
not a construct.

11
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,303
So what's a hypothetic hypothetical 
social psychological phenomena or 

12
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:01,044
entity,
whether or not that's real depends to 

13
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:08,450
some degree on what it's good for.
Right?

14
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,000
Part of the aim of science is prediction
and control and so

15
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,653
it's useful to take a look at important 
life outcomes among human beings and to 

16
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:20,904
determine whether or not you can predict
that because that's one way of testing 

17
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:25,224
whether or not the phenomena that you've
derived say from your statistical 

18
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:29,964
analysis,
both in the case of fluid intelligence 

19
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,880
or intelligence more broadly.
And in the case of the big five actually

20
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:36,714
has the capacity to manifest itself in a
meaningful way in the world outside of 

21
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,893
inside the lab.
That's one domain of potential 

22
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,950
validation,
but then outside the lab as well.

23
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,993
And so what we're going to do today is 
to look at the factors that determine 

24
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,190
performance in the real world.
And so you might think,

25
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:57,024
well,
what are some important real world 

26
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:00,810
outcomes on which performance might 
vary?

27
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,460
And we're going to stick to those that 
are rather obvious today.

28
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:09,030
We talked about creative achievement 
already for example,

29
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,710
but you could think of creative 
achievement,

30
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:14,370
entrepreneurial achievement,
those actually clumped together.

31
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,540
They're part of the same phenomena.
You think about academic achievement and

32
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:19,374
you could think about success in the 
workplace and then those can be 

33
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:25,260
subdivided because success in the 
workplace for example,

34
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,630
needs to be analyzed in terms of 
success.

35
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:30,780
Say at simple jobs in success at complex
jobs you'd like.

36
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:31,614
There's different ways of fractioning 
fractionating a phenomena to increase 

37
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:36,534
your capacity,
to understand it and to measure it and 

38
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:39,984
then to predict it.
But those are rough domains where 

39
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:45,000
there's self evident individual 
differences.

40
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,013
And where the capacity to predict 
performance would at least be of some 

41
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,560
utility,
a performance in the workplace.

42
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,370
This is an interesting one.
Performance in the workplace is a tricky

43
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:58,110
measure.
A tricky issue.

44
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,460
I've been working on performance 
prediction tests for a long time because

45
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:04,294
I was interested in,
because I'm a clinical psychologist and 

46
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:10,981
because I have a practical side,
I'm often interested in what the utility

47
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:14,380
of psychological measurements might be 
outside the lab.

48
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,250
It's interesting to consider that from 
an ethical perspective too.

49
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:21,400
So if you're hiring people,
you have

50
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:23,803
to conundrums that lay themselves in 
front of you and one is the ethical 

51
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:30,700
necessity to give each person a fair 
chance.

52
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:34,660
And the other is the ethical necessity 
to place the proper person in the proper

53
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:36,610
position.
And you might say,

54
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:37,444
well you could do that randomly and like
there are countries in Europe for 

55
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:43,540
example,
that have a quasi random approach to the

56
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,030
selection of university students.
So Holland just like that,

57
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,570
they have a pretty open admission 
policy.

58
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,003
Now,
what that means is that everyone has a 

59
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:53,794
chance to go to college,
but the downside of it is that the 

60
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:58,180
failure rate in the first year,
for example,

61
00:03:58,181 --> 00:03:59,014
is extraordinarily high.
Now you might say that's a perfectly 

62
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:02,644
reasonable price to pay for the open 
admission and for the opportunity to 

63
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:07,420
give everyone a chance,
but you could also say,

64
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:09,820
well,
that's a hell of a waste of time for the

65
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:13,720
people who go into the first year of 
college or university and fail.

66
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,643
It's not a pleasant experience for them.
It's a very expensive in terms of time 

67
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,113
and resources and perhaps it would have 
been better for them and for broader 

68
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,670
society had.
They'd been able to determine beforehand

69
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,743
whether they had two sets of qualities 
that were necessary to increase the 

70
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:32,650
probability of success.
Because if I could tell you,

71
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:33,640
well,
you know,

72
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:34,474
you have a 80 percent chance of success 
in this domain and only a 20 percent 

73
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:41,170
chance in this domain.
You still might want to take the risk in

74
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:44,890
the 20 percent success domain.
But you might also think,

75
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:45,724
well,
I might as well go off and function 

76
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:52,720
where my particular combination of 
proclivities has the best opportunity to

77
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:54,130
manifest itself.
And,

78
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,730
and because why not position yourself 
for success rather than failure?

79
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,743
Now,
I'm not saying that the ethical 

80
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,190
conundrum between those two alternatives
is something that's easy to,

81
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,103
uh,
what would you say an easy thing to map 

82
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:10,420
your way through.

83
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,253
It's by no means an easy way to map your
way through because there are strong 

84
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:16,210
arguments to be had on both sides of the
equation,

85
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,920
so,
but

86
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,110
there's still the scientific question 
that remains,

87
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:23,944
which is to what degree can you 
accurately predict people's performance 

88
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,573
and to what degree does that reflect 
positively or negatively on your 

89
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,743
psychological concepts?
And then there's the actual practical 

90
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,720
utility of potentially offering to 
schools,

91
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,643
to universities and to workplaces in 
general the probability of selecting 

92
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,100
people with an above average chance of 
succeeding.

93
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,113
It's even more complicated.
Say if you're selecting not so much 

94
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:52,420
entry level employees in a company 
because maybe you tell yourself they are

95
00:05:52,421 --> 00:05:53,254
more towards the possibility of bringing
more people in and letting them fail or 

96
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:57,514
succeed in the job,
but let's say you're replacing a 

97
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:03,200
management team at a medium to large 
size corporation.

98
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,050
You know if you bring in managers that 
are in competent,

99
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,973
not only are they going to fail,
which is obviously not very good for 

100
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:09,794
them,
and the failure rate among managers is 

101
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:11,654
very high.

102
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,700
It exceeds.
It exceeds 65.

103
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,760
I figure,
I think it's 65 percent of managers.

104
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,653
I believe that's correct.
Add zero or negative net value to the 

105
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:22,370
companies.
It's something like that.

106
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,443
The failure rate in managerial positions
is overwhelming and the problem with 

107
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:30,140
bringing someone into a managerial or an
executive position even worse,

108
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,123
who isn't competent to play that role is
that they can wipe out the careers of 

109
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:37,160
everyone that they're supervising.
And in the case of say,

110
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:37,994
large companies,
they can bring the whole damn company 

111
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:39,734
down and so it's not like the the,
the ethic of people deserve an equal 

112
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,860
chance,
let's say,

113
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:48,410
to fail and succeed isn't a very 
practical ethic.

114
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:49,244
When you're putting someone in a high 
demand position where the consequences 

115
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,630
of failure are can be overwhelming,
not only for that person but for all the

116
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:57,464
people that they happen to be whose 
destiny they happen to be involved in 

117
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:02,480
determining.

118
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,313
And so then you might say,
if you could come up with a selection 

119
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:06,404
process that would increase the 
probability of hiring and above average 

120
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,280
manager from 50 slash 50 to 60 slash 40 
or 70 slash 30.

121
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,010
Maybe you're actually ethically 
compelled to use that.

122
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:17,600
And in fact,
by law,

123
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,670
this is particularly the case in the 
United States.

124
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,660
You're required by law to use the most 
effective,

125
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:27,770
valid,
reliable and nondiscriminatory selection

126
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:31,940
process that currently exists in order 
to select your employees.

127
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:35,450
And one of the things that's going to 
happen to employers in the next 10 years

128
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:38,450
is they're going to get a very nasty 
shock for using interviews.

129
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:39,284
Because the data on unstructured 
interviews indicates quite clearly that 

130
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:44,150
a,
that they're discriminatory,

131
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,460
partly because they they,
for example,

132
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,240
if you're tall and assertive and good 
looking and charming,

133
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:55,550
then you're much more likely to do well 
in an interview,

134
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:56,384
but that doesn't necessarily have any 
bearing whatsoever on the probability 

135
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:03,260
that you'll succeed in the position and 
so and not only that,

136
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,580
the predictive validity of unstructured 
interviews is very low.

137
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,810
It's about point one,
two.

138
00:08:08,811 --> 00:08:09,644
It's something like that which means 
that if you just pick people randomly 

139
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,453
for success or failure,
let's say you'd have a 50 slash 50 

140
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:18,290
chance of predicting whether someone was
going to be a success or a failure.

141
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,200
It's just a coin toss and then if you 
used an unstructured interview,

142
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,660
you'd get that up to 56,
44,

143
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,110
which is slightly better,
but it's by no means it's not even close

144
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:29,570
to the accuracy that you could get.
For example,

145
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:31,880
if you just use the standard test of 
conscientiousness,

146
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,953
which would give you a correlation of 
about point two five with with say 

147
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,800
managerial with managerial productivity 
and there's this interesting.

148
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,960
This is an interesting thing to know.
It's called the binomial effect size,

149
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:48,440
display effect size is the magnitude of 
an effect,

150
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:49,274
right,
and and it's not an easy thing to get a 

151
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:53,330
handle on all that you really need to,
if you're going to be a psychologist,

152
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:54,164
because in any study there is an effect 
size indicator correlation off often or 

153
00:08:58,831 --> 00:08:59,664
an r squared,
which is the correlation squared or a 

154
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:01,674
Cohen's d,
which has the effect size expressed in 

155
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:05,040
standard deviation.

156
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,873
So something like that,
but you kind of have to understand that 

157
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:11,310
at a basic level to understand what 
statistics actually do.

158
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:12,144
And there's this phenomena called the 
binomial effect size display that can 

159
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:16,224
help you understand in an embodied sense
what the magnitude of a correlation 

160
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:22,830
means.
So here's how it works.

161
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,700
Imagine that you have a predictor of 
point two zero.

162
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,650
So the correlation is r equals point two
zero between phenomena.

163
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:33,840
One will say conscientiousness and 
phenomena,

164
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:36,060
two,
workplace performance point two,

165
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:38,250
zero correlation.
The question might be,

166
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,180
well,
how much?

167
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,763
How much would you improve your 
predictive capacity over chance levels 

168
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,893
if you applied that predictor?
And the answer is that the ar is the 

169
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:55,050
difference between the odds ratio.
So let me explain that.

170
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:57,790
So point five,
zero point five zero.

171
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,150
If you subtract one from the other,
you get zero.

172
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,440
So the predictive validity of selection 
by chance is zero point five,

173
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:06,960
zero minus point five,
zero equals zero.

174
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,480
That's the predictive validity of 
chance.

175
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,840
If you have a predictor of point two 
zero,

176
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:13,674
which is approximately,
that's sort of the low end estimate for 

177
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:16,374
conscientiousness,
then that would change your odds ratio 

178
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:21,300
from point five,
zero point five zero,

179
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,590
right?
Random two,

180
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,424
point six,
zero point four zero because point six 

181
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:28,020
zero minus point four,
zero point two zero.

182
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:28,854
And so the correlation coefficient turns
out to be the difference between the 

183
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:34,224
odds between the odds.
So and so it gives you a quick rule of 

184
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,400
thumb.
So for example,

185
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:41,730
so if you have a point two zero 
predictor that gives you 60 slash 40,

186
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,830
if you have a point three zero 
predictor,

187
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:46,680
that gives you 60 5:35 because point 
six,

188
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:49,020
five minus point three five is point 
three zero.

189
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,970
And if you have a point six predictor,
which is really up on the high end,

190
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:54,804
right,
you're really starting to push your 

191
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,010
limits of statistical predict prediction
validity at that point.

192
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,500
That gives you a point eight zero minus 
point two zero.

193
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:02,334
And so what you've done,
if you use a predictive of a predictor 

194
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:07,860
that has a correlation Coefficient of 
point six zero,

195
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,480
which you could get,
for example,

196
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:13,590
if you took conscientiousness and 
combined that with a good test of Iq for

197
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:16,290
predicting complex jobs,
you might be able to get up to point six

198
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:21,090
that moves your odds ratio of selecting 
an above average person for the position

199
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:22,860
from point five,
zero point five,

200
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:25,350
zero two point eight,
zero point two zero.

201
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,530
So it cuts your failure rate by more 
than half,

202
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,050
right?
Brings it down from point five,

203
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:30,930
zero.
Point two zero,

204
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,330
because point eight,
zero minus point two,

205
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:36,120
zero point six zero.
So that's a really good thing to know.

206
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:38,010
That's called the binomial effect size 
display.

207
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:39,510
It's really good thing to have in your 
mind.

208
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:40,230
It's very simple.

209
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,063
It's just a,
it's just subtraction and it gives you 

210
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,720
some sense of the power of,
of,

211
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:49,620
of statistical prediction.
Now the question might be,

212
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,663
well,
let's say you had a predictor of point 

213
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,830
two zero conscientiousness.
You might say,

214
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:54,581
well,
if you square,

215
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,414
they are.
That gives you four percent of the 

216
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:57,544
variance.
Who the hell cares for percent of the 

217
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:00,034
variance?
You've left 95 percent of the 

218
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,460
variability between people in terms of 
their performance unexplained.

219
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,361
You might say,
well,

220
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:08,800
why even bother?
Well,

221
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:13,830
the answer to that question is how much 
difference in productive output is there

222
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:15,244
between people?
Because if there's a tremendous degree 

223
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:18,304
of productive,
of difference in productive output 

224
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:20,974
between people than increasing your 
ability to predict someone's 

225
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:24,544
performance,
even by some relatively small increment 

226
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,173
might have massive economic utility.
If let's say the top 10 percent of your 

227
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:33,214
people are 50 times as productive as the
bottom 10 percent of your people than 

228
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:37,774
shifting your ability to predict up so 
that you have more of those extremely 

229
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:41,254
high performing people or less of the 
extremely low performing people might 

230
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,490
more than payoff might more than pay for
itself.

231
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,890
From an economic perspective,
even though your prediction,

232
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,143
your predictor isn't,
doesn't have that massive amount of 

233
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:56,590
power when that actually happens to be 
the case.

234
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,720
So back in 1968,
there was a guy named Walter Michelle.

235
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,780
He had reviewed,
he's a social psychologist.

236
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,943
He reviewed the personality literature 
up to that point and concluded that the 

237
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:06,724
typical personality measure only 
predicted the typical performance 

238
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:14,050
measure at about point two and that's 
actually remained relatively stable.

239
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,500
I would say it's a little higher than 
that.

240
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:18,640
It's probably point two five,
especially if you do things like correct

241
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:20,050
for measurement,
error and so forth.

242
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,380
And what Michelle said was,
because it's only point two five,

243
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,500
let's say you square that,
that's five percent of the variants.

244
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,350
You leave 95 percent of the phenomena 
unexplained.

245
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,483
You might as well not even bother 
measuring personality and so that 

246
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:33,934
actually killed the field of personality
from a psychometric perspective for 

247
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:37,750
about 25 years.

248
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,320
Really until about the early 19 nineties
when people woke up and thought,

249
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,243
wait a minute,
what are the typical effect sizes in 

250
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:48,490
other domains of prediction?
And then they found out that,

251
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,593
well,
the point two zero correlation that was 

252
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:52,384
typical of personality prediction was 
actually pretty damn good by social 

253
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:59,410
sciences or health sciences standards,
like it doesn't sound good when you just

254
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,303
think about it as an absolute measure 
because it leaves 95 percent of the 

255
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,864
phenomena unexplained,
but when you compare it to other things 

256
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:07,864
that people consider of reasonable 
magnitude than it turns out that 

257
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:13,090
personality psychologists are doing just
fine.

258
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,000
And then also in the 19 nineties,
and I'll show you some of this,

259
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:20,140
the economic calculations done and the 
so one of the calculations would be well

260
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,423
imagine that you have maybe it took 20 
companies and you did it a distribution 

261
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:28,120
of the productivity of their employees.

262
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,520
It's hard thing to do because you have 
to measure their productivity.

263
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,200
So how the hell do you do that?
Right?

264
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,330
With salespeople,
you can measure sales.

265
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,460
That's pretty straightforward.
With lawyers,

266
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:38,620
you can measure hours billed.
Like there are some,

267
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,933
there are some occupations where the 
performance measure is sort of built 

268
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:45,640
into the job.
But if you're a manager in the mid level

269
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:48,340
of a large corporation,
how the hell can you tell how productive

270
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:50,800
you are?
It's so there's a measurement problem on

271
00:14:50,801 --> 00:14:51,634
the productivity measurement and as well
as the performance prediction and and 

272
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:56,624
it's.
It's a very intractable problem and the 

273
00:14:58,101 --> 00:14:59,930
way that people often do that is by 
saying,

274
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:00,764
well,
let's say you're a manager in the mid 

275
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:02,744
level of a corporation.
How do we determine how productive we 

276
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:05,324
are?
You are,

277
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:10,070
while we might ask you to compare your,
your work productivity with your peers,

278
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,233
maybe construct up a questionnaire 
asking about your efficient use of time 

279
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:14,654
and so forth,
and then we might get your peers to do 

280
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:17,450
the same thing to you.

281
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,400
We might get your supervisors to do the 
same thing to you and we might get your,

282
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,513
your subordinates to do the same thing 
to you and then aggregate across all 

283
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:29,981
those measures and infer that that 
aggregate opinion actually constitutes a

284
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:33,380
valid measure of productivity.
You actually don't know,

285
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,273
right?
Because that assumes that what you're 

286
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:37,880
doing,
that your peers and your supervisors and

287
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:38,714
so forth.
Our rating is actually related in some 

288
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:44,450
positive manner to the bottom line of 
the company and you actually don't.

289
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,060
You actually can't figure that out.
This is actually,

290
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:47,894
I think why,
why large companies start to become 

291
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:49,784
unstable is because if there's enough 
layers between the operations of the 

292
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:59,021
people in the tiers of the corporation 
and the real outcome measure,

293
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:01,880
which is basically profit because that's
what we've got.

294
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,193
Then the relationship between your 
activity as a manager and the 

295
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:08,024
productivity of the company starts to 
become increasingly blurred and that 

296
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:11,774
might mean that you're working as hard 
as you can on something that's actually 

297
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:15,134
going to cost the company money so you 
would actually be much more productive 

298
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,153
from a profit perspective if you just 
didn't go to work at all and that that 

299
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,920
happens a lot in large corporations 
because you'd never know,

300
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,413
especially if there's a lot of steps 
that have to be undertaken in a process 

301
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,730
before you can test the product in the 
market.

302
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,700
You have no idea if you're wasting time 
and resources.

303
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,563
You just can't tell.
So the performance measurement issue is 

304
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:39,470
a very,
very complicated one.

305
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,483
We haven't talked about it that much,
but I gave you a kind of a brief 

306
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:43,484
overview of it.
Now what you really want to do is have 

307
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:45,734
multiple sources of information about 
performance and aggregate across them 

308
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,960
and if you can use real world measures 
that are tied to two income generation,

309
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:57,230
so much the better because you have to 
use something as your gold standard,

310
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:58,064
right?
You have to say at some point while 

311
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,383
we're going to define this as reality,
when it comes to performance and in a 

312
00:17:03,561 --> 00:17:04,394
free market economy,
roughly what you do there is you say 

313
00:17:06,471 --> 00:17:07,304
that what profit is the proxy for 
productivity and that isn't the same 

314
00:17:10,251 --> 00:17:11,084
thing saying is that it isn't the same 
thing as saying that profit is 

315
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,380
productivity.

316
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,573
That's not the same thing.
It's saying that at some point you have 

317
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:19,694
to decide what you're going to accept as
a measure of productivity because 

318
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:23,294
otherwise there's no point in even 
talking about it and you can't just not 

319
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:27,614
talk about productivity if you're 
running an organization because the 

320
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:31,304
organization doesn't exist unless it 
produces something that will keep it 

321
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,380
going and generally that happens to be 
money.

322
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,120
So anyways,
it's quite,

323
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,680
it's very complicated.
All of this.

324
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,850
I was also curious about because,
because I'm curious,

325
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:44,684
I guess is to find out what would happen
if I took a measure that was derived in 

326
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:50,070
the lab and then try to launch it out in
a,

327
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,880
in the actual real world environment,
tried to market and sell it and now that

328
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:57,430
was very informative because I presume 
that we develop tests,

329
00:17:57,431 --> 00:17:58,264
which I'll talk to you about.
There were actually pretty good at 

330
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:02,370
predicting performance,
managerial performance for example,

331
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:03,420
administrative performance.

332
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,260
We got ours have upwards of point six 
which is really bloody impressive.

333
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:08,700
So we could,
we could tell employers,

334
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:10,350
look,
if you use our tests,

335
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,423
we can increase the probability that 
you'll hire an above average employee 

336
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,813
from 50 slash 50 to 80 20 and the 
economic benefit of that will be 

337
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,460
staggering.
Staggering.

338
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:21,294
And,
and I'll show you the calculations that 

339
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:24,540
enabled that sort of,
that sort of prediction to be made.

340
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,630
And you might think,
well and this is what you do think.

341
00:18:27,631 --> 00:18:30,090
If you're naive about producing 
something of value,

342
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:30,751
you might think,
well,

343
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:33,420
if you can produce something that's of 
self evident,

344
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:37,680
economic value selling,
it will be a snap and that is so wrong,

345
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,530
you just cannot believe it.
So one of the things we found,

346
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:41,364
which was really mind boggling to me was
that you could make a case that the 

347
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:50,310
probability that a company will use a 
test that predicts performance,

348
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:51,144
the pro,
the probability that they will use the 

349
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:56,160
test is inversely related to the 
accuracy of the test,

350
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,413
which basically means that the less 
accurate tests are easier to sell and 

351
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:00,601
you think,
well,

352
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:01,950
why the hell would that be?

353
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:02,783
Why?
And the how in the world would it 

354
00:19:04,081 --> 00:19:04,914
possibly be that corporations would 
rather buy tests that don't work than 

355
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:08,844
tests that do work and that that is what
they do because really what they do by 

356
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:13,530
is the Meyer's breaks,
right?

357
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:18,120
That sells about a million units a year 
and the Myers Briggs has zero predictive

358
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:20,400
utility with regards to performance 
prediction.

359
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,590
So why do people use it?
Oh,

360
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:25,560
here's one reason it doesn't hurt 
anybody's feelings.

361
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,330
Everybody wins,
right?

362
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,770
And so then you think,
well,

363
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,813
do corporations really care whether or 
not everybody wins when they're being 

364
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:34,980
tested?
And the answer to that is yes,

365
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:39,900
much more often than you would think so.
So we hit all sorts of barriers.

366
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:43,230
That was one.
The problem with tests that work is that

367
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,690
most of the people who take them don't 
do very well on them.

368
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,210
And then the other problem is that 
people,

369
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,150
people aren't good at statistical 
reasoning at all.

370
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,440
They're really,
really bad at it.

371
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,840
And so for example,
they don't know the difference between a

372
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:59,610
percentage and a percentile.
So a percentage is if you get 40 percent

373
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:00,444
on a test,
it means you've got 40 percent of the 

374
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:02,064
questions,
right?

375
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,150
If you,
if you are at the 40th percentile in the

376
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:09,420
distribution of test scores,
it means that you perform better than 40

377
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:12,420
percent of the people.
That's actually not too bad.

378
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,130
Right?
But you'll think,

379
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:15,690
no,
that's not 40 percentile,

380
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:17,820
that's 40 percent.
And then you'll think that you failed.

381
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,890
And so one of the things we found for 
example,

382
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:20,724
was that when we were,
when we were marketing the tests to mid 

383
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:28,260
level managers who had some say at least
on whether or not they would be used,

384
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,380
the first thing they would say as well,
I want to do the test.

385
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,813
And the thing you say about that is no 
you don't because this is derived 

386
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:39,780
statistically,
you can't validate the test on the basis

387
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,900
of your opinion about its applicability 
in your case,

388
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:43,734
but you can't have that conversation 
that isn't going to go anywhere because 

389
00:20:46,021 --> 00:20:46,854
they say,
well,

390
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,040
I'd never give a test to my

391
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,930
employees that I hadn't taken myself.
It's like,

392
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:50,950
okay.
So then you think,

393
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:51,784
well you're a typical manager,
you're going to score at the 50th 

394
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:56,620
percentile.
You are not going to be happy about that

395
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,663
because you want a score at the 90th 
percentile because you confuse 

396
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:00,814
percentiles and percentages.
And also because you don't notice that 

397
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:06,190
if you're doing better than 50 percent 
of the managers.

398
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:07,990
That's actually pretty damn good 
question.

399
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,033
Yeah,

400
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,140
that's a good lead.
I'll,

401
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,960
I'll,
I'll answer that as I go through this.

402
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:23,860
Okay.
Okay.

403
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:24,963
So,
so that was often at a dead started 

404
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:28,114
right there.
And then the other thing we'd find this 

405
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:29,884
was cool to have horrible but cool.
So imagine a large corporation and you 

406
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,013
go in and you try to make a sales pitch 
to someone and maybe they're in hr and 

407
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:39,610
they say,
and you say to them,

408
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:40,444
look,
you could use these tests if you use it 

409
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:43,390
for 100.
People will increase your bottom line by

410
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,660
$2,000,000 a year.
You think people would be jumping up and

411
00:21:46,661 --> 00:21:48,340
down about that.
And they say,

412
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:50,470
well how much does it cost?
And we say,

413
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:54,160
well it doesn't matter because the cost 
to benefit ratio is what you should care

414
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:55,180
about,
not the cost.

415
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,370
Because they would want it say for $9 a 
test.

416
00:21:57,371 --> 00:21:58,204
It was like,
no,

417
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,140
if you do this for each and I'll show 
you the mathematics and a bit.

418
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,573
Each person that you select with this 
test will bring $20,000 of extra value 

419
00:22:07,211 --> 00:22:09,580
to your company.
You're not getting that for $9.

420
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,990
And then they say,
well wait a minute.

421
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:14,920
We have a budget for testing that's 
limited to $9 a test and they say,

422
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:15,754
well,
it's going to produce $30,000 a year in 

423
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:18,040
revenue.
They say,

424
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:18,874
well that revenue goes to another branch
of the company and we won't get any 

425
00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:21,784
credit for it.
We'll just get punished because we've 

426
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,540
exceeded our budget,
our budget for selection.

427
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,130
I thought,
Oh yeah,

428
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,043
I never,
never,

429
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,690
never expected that to come up as an 
obstacle so you know,

430
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,733
so we had very well designed products.
They also talk about 90 minutes because 

431
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,354
we,
we started with a full scale 

432
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:39,154
neuropsychological assessment,
so we took tests of dorsolateral 

433
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,593
prefrontal cortical ability which had 
before that been administered by neuro 

434
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:50,530
psychologists and we computerized and we
did that back in 1993.

435
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,363
So it was among the first attempts to do
this sort of thing and then we had a 90 

436
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:54,734
minute test battery that also assessed 
the big five and then you could give 

437
00:22:57,911 --> 00:23:00,120
that to employees and you know,
you could,

438
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,063
you could produce this 80 slash 20 
differential that I described and well 

439
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,320
then we found out what that test was too
long.

440
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,310
It's like,
well,

441
00:23:06,311 --> 00:23:07,144
what do you mean you're going to gain 
$30,000 a year per employee if you use 

442
00:23:10,211 --> 00:23:10,931
this test?
It's like,

443
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,730
no,
people don't want to be tested that log.

444
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,780
It's like,
okay,

445
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,530
so you want an accurate test that 
doesn't discriminate against anybody.

446
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,483
That makes everyone feel good.
That's dirt cheap and that doesn't take 

447
00:23:20,411 --> 00:23:21,910
any time at all.
It's like,

448
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:22,983
well,
it took us about 15 years to build one 

449
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:25,144
of those after we had built the original
thing that actually worked and so even 

450
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:28,864
then the the,
the process of trying to introduce it 

451
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:32,920
into the workplace was almost 
impossible.

452
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,310
The other thing you find if you're 
trying to sell the large companies,

453
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:37,144
this is this is worth knowing,
is that it's great if you can sell to a 

454
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:42,510
large company because it's a large 
company man and so you.

455
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,830
The potential for the sale is 
astronomical,

456
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,240
but large companies are so slow you 
cannot believe it,

457
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,150
and so it might take you three years.
First of all,

458
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,133
you have to find who you should talk to.
That's impossible because they all the 

459
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:59,870
people that you can talk to have no 
decision making power whatsoever,

460
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,410
so all you do is waste your time talking
to them and they'll talk to you.

461
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,363
They'll have meetings with you,
but it won't matter because they don't 

462
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:06,434
have any decision making power and then 
you can't get access to people who have 

463
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:12,020
the decision making power because they 
don't let you have access to them.

464
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,550
And so that's a huge problem and even 
figuring them out is a huge problem.

465
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,563
And even figuring out that those are the
people that you need to talk to is a 

466
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:20,474
huge problem.
So that might take you five years just 

467
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,310
to get it through your head that,
that you're wasting your time.

468
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:28,340
Ninety five percent of the time talking 
to the wrong people.

469
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,950
And so then the next thing that happens,
this is really,

470
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,010
this is really comical.
So let's say you do make some headway.

471
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:35,620
It takes you three bloody years.
You've,

472
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,310
you've made a relationship with the 
person,

473
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,323
they're ready to launch it.
Then they have to market it internally 

474
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:40,994
and that takes them a year because they 
have to convince everybody to get 

475
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,733
onboard and then the corporation 
reshuffles and the person that you're 

476
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,400
dealing with disappears.
It's like that happened to us.

477
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:51,350
We were marketing to a very large 
company.

478
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,483
We would go all the way up to the CEO 
and ready to with this was with the 

479
00:24:56,301 --> 00:25:00,560
future authoring program and we were 
ready to launch the damn product.

480
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:04,880
It took us a huge amount of time to get 
through all the layers and just the week

481
00:25:04,881 --> 00:25:05,714
that we were going to launch it,
the CEO resigned and the company stock 

482
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:08,864
crashed and that was the end of that.
Bang and and large companies are like 

483
00:25:12,801 --> 00:25:13,634
that.
Like they're extremely slow and the 

484
00:25:15,651 --> 00:25:20,300
typical duration that a person lasts in 
a given position,

485
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:21,134
and this is something to consider with 
regards to your careers is both for 

486
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:24,434
years.
So you'll occupy the position you're in 

487
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:30,500
for about four years and then while 
you'll either fail out,

488
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,513
you'll move laterally or you'll move up.
And so it's a three year sales cycle 

489
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:35,984
minimum,
and that's interweaved with the 

490
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:40,940
possibility that whoever you're talking 
to is just going to disappear.

491
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,973
It's so.
And then if you small cell to small 

492
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:44,870
companies,
well they're faster,

493
00:25:44,871 --> 00:25:48,440
but they don't have any money.
So that's not very helpful.

494
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,453
So it's extraordinarily difficult even 
if you produce something of high value 

495
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,160
and that you have proof that the thing 
exists,

496
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,260
it's extraordinarily difficult to sell 
it.

497
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,480
And so here's another thing to think 
about.

498
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,043
No,
I think I've mentioned this to you 

499
00:26:02,031 --> 00:26:02,864
before.
If you write a book which is virtually 

500
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:05,690
impossible,
and then get a publisher,

501
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:08,780
which is virtually impossible,
you probably have a rejection rate of 99

502
00:26:08,781 --> 00:26:11,930
percent.
So then if you do,

503
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,280
if you do manage to publish the book 
with a reasonable publisher,

504
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:19,670
which you won't because it's impossible,
then you get eight percent royalties.

505
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,533
That's it.
So 92 percent of your labor goes to the 

506
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:24,254
sales,
marketing and distribution end of 

507
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:27,110
things.
And so it's just.

508
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:31,940
So it's very,
very difficult to generate capital as an

509
00:26:31,941 --> 00:26:32,750
entrepreneur.

510
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:37,250
And there's innumerable impediments.
One of the things that people do,

511
00:26:37,251 --> 00:26:40,880
and this is something for those of you 
who might be entrepreneurially minded,

512
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,863
here's another thing that you have to 
understand is that you can't really 

513
00:26:44,131 --> 00:26:46,980
create a product and then launch it 
because first of all,

514
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,143
you don't know how to do that.
You might know how to create the 

515
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:50,784
product,
but you do not know how to market or 

516
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,700
sell it.
You don't know how to advertise it.

517
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:54,990
You don't know how to communicate about 
it.

518
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,033
You don't know how to ship it like 
there's all sorts of things you just 

519
00:26:58,441 --> 00:26:59,274
don't know,
but worse is you don't know if people 

520
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:03,480
will use it and so what companies do 
that,

521
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,343
jen,
that roll out new products on a 

522
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:06,714
relatively continual basis do is they 
don't develop the product and then go 

523
00:27:09,781 --> 00:27:10,614
sell it.
They continually communicate with their 

524
00:27:12,271 --> 00:27:16,320
customers about what product the 
customer is willing to buy next and then

525
00:27:16,321 --> 00:27:21,321
they develop that and so you have to 
have your market identified and then you

526
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:24,090
have to be in continual communication 
with the market.

527
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,740
Well,
you develop the product.

528
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:26,574
It's not.
I built a better mouse trap and the 

529
00:27:27,601 --> 00:27:28,434
world comes marching to my door.
That isn't how it works is that you got 

530
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,653
to find out if someone wants to buy your
stupid thing and then the next thing is 

531
00:27:35,911 --> 00:27:36,744
is that even if you have a great thing,
you're going to go talk to people and 

532
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,260
they have 50 great things that they 
might buy and they're all great,

533
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,094
but they're not going to buy all 50.
They might buy one maybe and maybe 

534
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:47,514
they'll buy it this week,
but probably they'll buy it in six 

535
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:51,840
months and they're not going to buy any 
of them no matter how great.

536
00:27:51,841 --> 00:27:52,674
Unless they're on fire and you're 
selling water because they're so busy 

537
00:27:56,671 --> 00:27:58,290
already,
right?

538
00:27:58,291 --> 00:27:59,124
They're so overwhelmed and preoccupied 
by their jobs that if you come in and 

539
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:02,701
you say,
well,

540
00:28:02,701 --> 00:28:03,534
here,
this is going to increase your 

541
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:06,990
efficiency by 20 percent and here's the 
three weeks.

542
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:07,823
You'd have to spend doing that,
and then the payoff would come in the 

543
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:10,891
next years.
They'll say,

544
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:11,724
yeah,
we'll all do that as soon as I have 

545
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,970
time,
and as soon as I have,

546
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,833
time is never.
So if they're on fire and you have 

547
00:28:18,121 --> 00:28:19,290
water,
you can sell it to them,

548
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,990
but that's all because otherwise it's a 
no goal.

549
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:22,943
So those are all things that,
that are worthwhile knowing because 

550
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:29,520
they're very hard to learn.
And so and very comically,

551
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:30,354
I mean,
if you would've told me when I first 

552
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:35,850
started developing these tests that one 
of the reasons corporations wouldn't buy

553
00:28:35,851 --> 00:28:39,090
them because they worked that I would 
have just thought really.

554
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,841
I mean,
come on.

555
00:28:39,841 --> 00:28:41,310
Really?
That's really the reason.

556
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:42,280
It's like,
yeah,

557
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,670
yeah,
that's the reason God.

558
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,770
So very,
very,

559
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,633
very problematic.
And then they already have their 

560
00:28:50,671 --> 00:28:52,980
processes in place and they're 
entrenched.

561
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,150
And then then the next problem is,
you know,

562
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,520
you haven't got any customers.

563
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,353
I think I told you that before,
you don't have any customers and you 

564
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:00,384
show them the statistics,
but they can understand this statistics 

565
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:03,354
and they also have 200 other people 
selling them things and 50 of them are 

566
00:29:06,181 --> 00:29:07,890
crooks.
So they're just lying about what they're

567
00:29:07,891 --> 00:29:08,724
doing.
They can't tell the difference between 

568
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:11,760
the liars and the people who were 
telling the truth.

569
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:15,180
And so they can't and they can't 
understand the statistics for themselves

570
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:16,014
and they can't verify them anyways.
So what they ask you is who else is 

571
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:20,520
using it?
And if the answer is,

572
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:21,354
well everybody,
then you don't even have to do the sale 

573
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:25,980
because you're already rich.
And if the answer is nobody,

574
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:27,180
then they are going to say,
well,

575
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:28,740
why is nobody using this?
You say,

576
00:29:28,741 --> 00:29:30,480
well,
it's the hottest thing that's come along

577
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:31,380
and they think,
well,

578
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:32,214
I'm not going to be the sucker who gets 
painted red dead fired because this 

579
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:39,420
failed that they do not think this might
make me succeed.

580
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:43,000
People do not about whether or not they 
succeed.

581
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,790
They care about whether or not they 
fail.

582
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:46,983
And so that's another thing is that if 
you're marketing something and you can 

583
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:51,940
say,
this will stop you from being identified

584
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:54,700
as a failure than people might be happy 
about that.

585
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,310
But if you say,
this will really help you succeed.

586
00:29:57,311 --> 00:29:57,811
It's like,
yeah,

587
00:29:57,811 --> 00:29:58,331
yeah,
no,

588
00:29:58,331 --> 00:30:00,910
I don't want to succeed.
I just don't want to fail.

589
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,833
I don't want to succeed.
I just want to be invisible and be left 

590
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,003
alone.
And if you're looking for people's 

591
00:30:07,871 --> 00:30:10,630
fundamental motivation,
that's it.

592
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:15,010
It's they want to be invisible and they 
want to be left alone.

593
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,910
I tell you,
the Zebra story [inaudible] you,

594
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,770
any of you know that story.
Okay,

595
00:30:20,771 --> 00:30:21,581
I'll,
I'll tell you,

596
00:30:21,581 --> 00:30:22,800
this is ebro story.
Tell it,

597
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,673
stop me if I've told it to you before.
This tells you everything you need to 

598
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:26,860
know about human beings.

599
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,090
So it's weird.
It's worth.

600
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:29,290
It's worth knowing.
Okay?

601
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:32,260
So zebras have stripes and people say,
well,

602
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:33,094
that's for camouflage.
And then you think about that for two 

603
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,124
seconds and you think that's a really 
stupid theory because lions are 

604
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,544
camouflaged and they're like golden,
like the grass and zebras are black and 

605
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:45,490
white.
So you can see a zebra five miles away.

606
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:47,140
It's like there's a zebra,
it's black and white.

607
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,213
So the whole camouflage thing that's 
just not working out so well as a 

608
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:52,270
hypothesis.
Okay?

609
00:30:52,271 --> 00:30:53,104
So bylaw biologists go and they decided 
to take a look at some zebras and so 

610
00:30:56,711 --> 00:31:00,700
they're looking at zebra at on the herd 
because there's no zebra,

611
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,280
right?
Just like there's no fish.

612
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:06,070
There are schools of fish and there are 
herds of zebras.

613
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,083
There isn't a fish.
This is why I think the cod aren't 

614
00:31:08,981 --> 00:31:11,440
coming back.
There are no cod.

615
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:16,090
There are massive hundred mile long 
schools have cod,

616
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:19,720
10 stories deep,
20 million years old.

617
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,733
You wipe out the school.
You don't just get to throw a quad in 

618
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:23,710
the water and say,
well,

619
00:31:23,711 --> 00:31:24,790
you know,
off you go.

620
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:25,630
It's like,
well,

621
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,240
where's my city?
It's like launching you in the middle of

622
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:29,260
a field.
It's like,

623
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,240
well,
go out there and reproduce.

624
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:31,871
It's like,
no,

625
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:33,160
that's not gonna happen.
You know,

626
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,360
so without the school that there's no 
cod and you can't just introduce a whole

627
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:40,000
school of cod because you don't have a 
whole school of cod.

628
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:40,834
So you know,
maybe the cod are never coming back and 

629
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,710
zebras are the same thing.
There's not a zebra,

630
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,573
there's zebras and so you're looking at 
the zebras trying to study as zebra and 

631
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,570
you look at the Zebra and you make some 
notes and you look up and you think,

632
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,320
oh Christ.

633
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,710
Which zebra was I looking at?
And the answer to that is you don't know

634
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,753
because the,
the camouflage is against the herd and 

635
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:02,590
the black and white stripes.
There's a variety of reasons for this.

636
00:32:02,591 --> 00:32:05,740
Stripes flies also seem not to like the 
stripes,

637
00:32:05,741 --> 00:32:07,150
but you know,
usually people,

638
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,790
things evolve for multiple reasons.
But anyways,

639
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:12,280
it's very difficult to parse out a zebra
against the herd.

640
00:32:12,281 --> 00:32:13,210
You look down,
you look up,

641
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:14,050
it's like,
oh,

642
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,150
I'll hold those damn zebras look the 
same.

643
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,130
Yes,
the camouflage is effective,

644
00:32:18,131 --> 00:32:20,500
but it's against the herd.
All right?

645
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,363
So then you think,
well we better identify a zebra so we 

646
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:23,944
can see what he's up to.
So then you take your jeep and a can of 

647
00:32:27,221 --> 00:32:29,170
red paint and a stick with a rag on the 
end of it.

648
00:32:29,171 --> 00:32:31,960
And you drive up to the zebras and you 
paint their haunch.

649
00:32:31,961 --> 00:32:32,794
Read that a little bit,
put a nice red dot on their haunch or 

650
00:32:34,271 --> 00:32:36,070
maybe clipped the rear with a clip.

651
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,350
And then you know,
you stand back and you think,

652
00:32:38,351 --> 00:32:39,184
Hey,
I'm pretty,

653
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,093
now I'm going to watch that zebra.
So what do you think happens to the 

654
00:32:41,631 --> 00:32:44,570
Zebra?
The lions kill it.

655
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,360
Right?
Right,

656
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,280
right,
because lions,

657
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,540
they're smart,
right?

658
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:55,490
Hunter hunting animals are smart,
but they have to identify a zebra before

659
00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:58,580
they can organize their hunt.
They can't just hunt the whole herd.

660
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,653
They have to pick out a zebra and so 
maybe it's like a zebra that's got a 

661
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:04,550
sore hip or something.
And so you think,

662
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:05,600
well,
nature's kind.

663
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:09,320
It just takes the week.
It's though no zebra or lions,

664
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,154
like really healthy delicious zebras,
but they look like all the other 

665
00:33:12,681 --> 00:33:13,514
healthy,
delicious zebras so they can't get a 

666
00:33:14,841 --> 00:33:15,674
beat on them.
But if there are small and just born or 

667
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:20,570
if they're limping or there's something 
that identifies them,

668
00:33:20,571 --> 00:33:24,140
then the lions can pick them out and 
then they do pick them out.

669
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,573
And so the rule for human beings is keep
your damn stripes on so the lions don't 

670
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:31,730
get you.
And I'm telling you,

671
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:32,564
man,
if you want to remember one thing from 

672
00:33:34,071 --> 00:33:37,340
my class about human motivation,
that's a good thing to learn.

673
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,473
People camouflage themselves against the
herd and they like to be in the middle 

674
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:43,910
of the herd,
which is what fish do.

675
00:33:43,911 --> 00:33:45,620
By the way,
if you have a big school of fish,

676
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,060
the smart,
healthy,

677
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:47,894
large fish are in the middle of the 
school because you know what you call a 

678
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:54,470
fish on the outside of the school bait,
right?

679
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:55,963
So that's what people are doing there 
are trying to move into the middle of 

680
00:33:58,671 --> 00:33:59,504
the herd all the time and the herd moves
around or the school moves around and 

681
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:02,751
people are going,
well,

682
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:04,460
I'm in the middle,
I'm staying in the middle here,

683
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:05,294
so I've got this protective ring of 
people around me so the predators don't 

684
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:10,940
pick me out and do me in.

685
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,020
So okay,
so that's part of the reason why I said,

686
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:15,854
well,
you can't sell something to someone for 

687
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:19,550
success because you're thinking,
well,

688
00:34:19,551 --> 00:34:21,260
people are aiming at success.
Don't,

689
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:22,094
don't be thinking that.
It's not by any means necessarily true 

690
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,640
trait.
Neuroticism is a potential most powerful

691
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:29,474
motivator and trait.
Neuroticism is let's not be too 

692
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:33,380
threatened or hurt,
right?

693
00:34:33,381 --> 00:34:34,214
That's the negative emotion system.
And the negative emotion system is a 

694
00:34:36,831 --> 00:34:38,860
killer source of motivation.
You know,

695
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:42,980
you also see that there are scales of 
wellbeing that have been designed mostly

696
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:45,830
by social psychologists,
which means they're very bad scales most

697
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:49,790
of the time because their psychometric 
capacity is absurdly low,

698
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:50,624
generally speaking,
so what you find with scales of 

699
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:53,564
wellbeing sometimes they're talked about
as scales of happiness even is that 

700
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,730
people aren't after happiness 
thereafter,

701
00:34:58,731 --> 00:34:59,564
not hurting.
It's not so they don't want to be 

702
00:35:01,941 --> 00:35:02,774
extroverted and enthusiastic,
right and and bubbly and full of smiles 

703
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:07,220
and laughter.

704
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,410
That isn't what they mean by I want to 
be happy.

705
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,170
What they mean is I don't want to be 
anxious or in pain,

706
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,590
and so wellbeing scales tend to be 
something like

707
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,760
neuroticism,
sorry,

708
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:20,683
emotional stability plus extroversion,
but the big loading is on emotional 

709
00:35:24,231 --> 00:35:25,670
stability.
The reverse of neuroticism.

710
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,980
You want to avoid suffering.
You don't want to be happy.

711
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:31,820
You want to avoid suffering,
and one way to avoid suffering is not to

712
00:35:31,821 --> 00:35:32,654
let the Lions Gnaw on you,
and one way of doing that is to stay in 

713
00:35:35,241 --> 00:35:37,910
the middle of the damn hurt and so and 
like,

714
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,980
I'm not being a smart Alec about this.
I understand why people do that.

715
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:44,610
There's real danger to being visible.
There's real danger in being visible.

716
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,653
Now.
You might be successful if you're 

717
00:35:46,321 --> 00:35:48,060
visible,
but you also might be dead.

718
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,283
So okay,
so now there's a number of things to 

719
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:53,964
consider if you're thinking about 
performance prediction and one of them 

720
00:35:55,681 --> 00:35:56,514
is to what degree do people vary in 
terms of their performance capacity and 

721
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:01,261
you might say,
well,

722
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:03,180
there's very little performance 
variability,

723
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,570
or you might say there's a tremendous 
amount of performance variability,

724
00:36:06,571 --> 00:36:10,050
or you might say there's an absurd 
amount of performance variability and it

725
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:14,640
turns out that the claim that there's an
absurd amount of performance variability

726
00:36:14,641 --> 00:36:15,720
is the proper claim.

727
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:18,780
Iq is normally distributed,
so is conscientiousness,

728
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:19,823
but productivity is distributed along 
the prieto distribution and I'll show 

729
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:24,414
you why and that follows a law called 
price's law from someone named Derek to 

730
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,560
solar price who was studying scientific 
productivity in the early 19 sixties.

731
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,753
And what he showed was that a 
vanishingly small proportion of the 

732
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:36,294
scientists operating in a given 
scientific domain produced half the 

733
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:42,330
output.
And so what you see and what's happening

734
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:45,660
is that to do really well at a given 
productive task,

735
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,700
which would also include generating 
money as as a proxy for,

736
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,280
for,
for creative productivity,

737
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,040
is that you have to be a bunch of 
things,

738
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:55,860
have to go your way simultaneously.
So maybe you have to be really,

739
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:57,090
really smart.
You have to be really,

740
00:36:57,091 --> 00:36:58,620
really lucky.
You have to be really healthy,

741
00:36:58,621 --> 00:37:01,620
you have to be really energetic,
you have to be really conscientious,

742
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,660
you have to be in the right time at the 
right place,

743
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,930
and maybe you also have to have the 
right social network,

744
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:07,380
right?

745
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,640
So it's a lot of things and each of 
those are small probability there.

746
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,503
Each of those are small probabilities.
And then if you multiply the small 

747
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:16,074
probabilities together,
you get an extraordinarily tiny 

748
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:18,864
probability and you have to have all 
those things functioning before you're 

749
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:23,200
going to end out on the,
on the,

750
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,920
on the extreme end of the productivity 
distribution.

751
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:26,963
But if you do end up there,
then you produce almost all of 

752
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:30,564
everything.
So it's a tiny number of people that 

753
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:33,594
produce almost all of everything.
That's price's law and technically it 

754
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:38,160
is,
and I mentioned this to you before,

755
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:38,994
it's the square root law.
The square root of the number of people 

756
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,660
in a productive domain produce half the 
output,

757
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,790
right?
So if you have 10 employees,

758
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:46,920
three of them produce half the output.
If you have 100,

759
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:49,800
10 of them produce half the output.
If you have 10,000,

760
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,440
100 of them produce half the productive 
output,

761
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,483
and so what that also means is that 
because there's massive variability in 

762
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:57,354
performance,
you don't have to shift your ability to 

763
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,910
predict performance very,
very,

764
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:03,923
very much up towards being better at it 
to gain substantially on the positive 

765
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:08,994
side because there's so much difference 
in productivity and that actually 

766
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:15,510
happens to be also a function of the 
complexity of the job.

767
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,000
If the job is simple,
which is means you can.

768
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,750
This job has 10 rules,
maybe that's a janitorial job.

769
00:38:21,751 --> 00:38:24,420
Let's say you do,
it takes a little while to learn it,

770
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:25,523
but once you've learned it,
you basically do the same thing all the 

771
00:38:27,061 --> 00:38:27,894
time.
There's not a lot of performance 

772
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:30,084
variability in those jobs and most of 
that would be not by conscientiousness 

773
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,823
and also to some by neuroticism because 
the higher people who are higher in 

774
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:40,330
neuroticism would be more likely to miss
work,

775
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:41,830
but,
but,

776
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,310
but general cognitive ability for 
example,

777
00:38:44,311 --> 00:38:45,144
is not a good predictor at all.
It'll predict how fast you learn the 

778
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:49,870
tasks initially,
but not how well you perform the test,

779
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,630
but if the task to you're doing are 
shifting constantly,

780
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,553
so your responsibilities change or 
you're in a creative job where you're 

781
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:59,890
constantly solving new problems.
So those are kind of the same thing.

782
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,090
Then Iq,
as the complexity of the job increases,

783
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,950
the predictive utility of Iq increases,
which is only to say that smarter people

784
00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:09,784
can handle complex situations faster.
So that's doesn't seem like a 

785
00:39:12,761 --> 00:39:13,594
particularly radical claim.
So price's law dictates that there's 

786
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,390
massive individual productivity 
differences between people.

787
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:23,200
So increasing your predictive,
your capacity for predicting performance

788
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:26,450
even by small increments,
has a huge economic consequence.

789
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,293
That was established in the 19 nineties.
The equations were first developed in 

790
00:39:29,891 --> 00:39:30,724
the 19 nineties and that's part of the 
reason that I started working on 

791
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:35,950
performance prediction tests because I 
read the economics and I thought,

792
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,053
oh my God,
you can produce a test that costs $30 

793
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:41,380
times.
Say Baby,

794
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:45,220
you have 50 applicants for the position,
$1,500 to administer,

795
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,323
and it'll produce an increments of 
something like 30 percent of salary 

796
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:52,300
permanently for the person that you put 
in a position.

797
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,163
So let's say you hire a $75,000 employee
and it increases their productivity by 

798
00:39:57,521 --> 00:40:00,310
30 percent,
so we'll say roughly $25,000,

799
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:05,230
you'll get a $25,000 return on a $1,500 
investment every single year.

800
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:08,110
That person occupies the position on 
average,

801
00:40:08,111 --> 00:40:08,944
that's four years.
That's $100,000 payoff for your $1,500 

802
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:13,120
investment.
I read that.

803
00:40:13,121 --> 00:40:14,050
I thought,
oh,

804
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,290
that'll be easy to sell.
It's like wrong.

805
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,243
Wrong.
Even though the economic payoff was so 

806
00:40:20,021 --> 00:40:20,854
massive,
I told you the other impediments that 

807
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,890
did emerge,
but the,

808
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,033
the arithmetic or the capacity to 
produce these calculations was 

809
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:32,230
established in the 19 nineties and I'll 
show you the equations in a bit here.

810
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,590
Okay,
so we already talked about what a normal

811
00:40:35,591 --> 00:40:36,424
distribution looks like.
That's the red line and a normal 

812
00:40:38,741 --> 00:40:41,830
distribution emerges as a consequence of
chance processes.

813
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:45,310
So we'll take a look at those here.
Hopefully this will work.

814
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,553
Look at that.

815
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,880
So there's your corporate advertisement 
for the day,

816
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,270
but it's not often you see a heroic,
normal distribution,

817
00:42:33,271 --> 00:42:34,230
but they're.
There you go.

818
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:35,670
So,
so,

819
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:36,683
so what you see is that you get a 
pattern output as a consequence of 

820
00:42:39,751 --> 00:42:40,584
chance processes and so where you 
happened to be on the distribution for 

821
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:46,410
all of the traits that we've described 
as a consequence of innumerable chance,

822
00:42:46,411 --> 00:42:47,244
genetic genetic and cultural processes.
But a lot of them are a lot more than 

823
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:51,444
people like to admit her genetic.
I mean you can make people stupid or 

824
00:42:54,361 --> 00:42:55,194
with the environment,
but it's not that easy to make them 

825
00:42:56,311 --> 00:42:58,740
smarter.
So because it's what I think about it,

826
00:42:58,741 --> 00:42:59,574
right,
it's way easier to make something worse 

827
00:43:00,331 --> 00:43:03,780
than it is to make something better,
and so even if you take everyone and you

828
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:08,781
give them optimal access to information 
and say optimal nutrition,

829
00:43:09,301 --> 00:43:11,820
which pretty much everybody's in that 
position now,

830
00:43:11,821 --> 00:43:12,654
at least in so far as we can manage it,
you're going to get massive genetic 

831
00:43:15,481 --> 00:43:16,314
differences in such things as 
conscientiousness or extroversion or 

832
00:43:18,631 --> 00:43:20,250
intelligence as you would.

833
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,113
In fact,
as you flatten out the sociocultural 

834
00:43:23,161 --> 00:43:23,994
environment,
say you take everybody and you provide 

835
00:43:25,501 --> 00:43:28,290
them with optimal nutrition and optimal 
access to information,

836
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,750
which you've pretty much done by the way
with a computer,

837
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:31,823
right?
Because how are you going to give 

838
00:43:32,191 --> 00:43:36,840
someone more access to information than 
to give them a web enabled computer?

839
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:38,340
That's it,
right?

840
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:40,050
There's.
There's just no better.

841
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,470
It's an infinite library.
You can learn anything with it.

842
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:44,603
So we're done.
We've equalized the education landscape 

843
00:43:46,681 --> 00:43:49,200
roughly speaking and then nutritionally.
Well,

844
00:43:49,201 --> 00:43:50,034
you know,
yeah,

845
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:52,080
some people eat badly and some people 
eat better,

846
00:43:52,081 --> 00:43:52,914
but the option to eat well is basically 
open to at least everybody in North 

847
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,150
America.
Roughly speaking,

848
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,570
you've wiped out the social socio 
cultural variation.

849
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,411
You might think,
well,

850
00:44:01,411 --> 00:44:03,240
that equalizes people.
It's wrong.

851
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:07,110
All it does is reduce the variability to
the remaining biological differences.

852
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:12,260
You maximize the genetic variability by 
minimizing the socio variability,

853
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:13,350
right?

854
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,183
Very important thing to understand.
This is why the gender differences 

855
00:44:17,551 --> 00:44:18,384
between personality between men and 
women are largest in the Scandinavian 

856
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:21,744
countries.
Tens of thousands of people have been 

857
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,413
assessed along these dimensions.
We know that we know the data that have 

858
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:28,464
come in are clear.
The biggest differences between men and 

859
00:44:30,421 --> 00:44:31,254
women in the in terms of personality and
in terms of interest are in the 

860
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:37,950
Scandinavian countries.
Why wiped out sociocultural variation?

861
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,050
All you've got left is biological 
differences,

862
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,650
so,
so,

863
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:42,603
so well.
You can draw your own conclusions from 

864
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:45,234
that.
It's unfortunate and fortunate at the 

865
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:49,650
same time.
All right,

866
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:52,170
so here's a parade distribution.
This is the distribution.

867
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:53,183
Remember I showed you with the creative 
achievement questionnaire that almost 

868
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:58,380
everybody stacked up at zero,
people have zero creative output,

869
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,333
the median person has zero lifetime 
creative output and then there's a tiny 

870
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:06,540
proportion that are way the hell out on 
the right hand end of the distribution,

871
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:07,374
right?
Those are the people have who have 

872
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:12,180
everything is cycling forward for them 
and as they get more well known,

873
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:14,760
of course they get more opportunities as
well.

874
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:17,650
Con,
cut.

875
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:20,150
Person's very conscientious.
So I just,

876
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:22,340
I'll just run this simulation for you.
Okay?

877
00:45:22,341 --> 00:45:25,270
And this shows you why the distribution 
emerges.

878
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,850
Now you have to watch this quickly 
because it's a fairly fast animation.

879
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,940
So here's what happens.
Everybody starts out with $10.

880
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:33,920
There's a thousand people playing the 
game.

881
00:45:33,921 --> 00:45:37,400
Everybody starts out with $10.
We have a dollar,

882
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,600
you have a dollar.
I flip a coin.

883
00:45:38,601 --> 00:45:40,070
If I get heads,
you give me a dollar.

884
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,050
If I get tails,
I give you a daughter.

885
00:45:42,051 --> 00:45:44,390
We go around and we trade with everyone.
Okay?

886
00:45:44,391 --> 00:45:45,224
So the first thing that happens when 
people start to trade is this normal 

887
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,420
distribution develops,
right?

888
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:51,254
Because some people lose and some people
when it's just like the Golden Board 

889
00:45:53,481 --> 00:45:54,650
that I showed you,
okay,

890
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:55,484
so you keep playing.
People start to stack up at zero watch 

891
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,880
because they lose 10 times in a row,
Bang,

892
00:46:01,881 --> 00:46:02,714
they're done.

893
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:09,810
The bottom graph is a graph of the 
entropy of the distribution,

894
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:10,644
which increases as the game continues
because at the beginning it's maximally 

895
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:15,451
ordered,
right?

896
00:46:15,451 --> 00:46:18,630
Everybody has exactly the same amount.
Now it's being distributed.

897
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:23,010
Same equations apply to the distribution
of gas into a vacuum.

898
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,890
Well,
what happens now,

899
00:46:25,891 --> 00:46:27,980
someone you know,
there are people out there at the,

900
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,230
at the $50 range or at the $60 range,
at the $70 range.

901
00:46:31,231 --> 00:46:34,590
You keep playing it.
Well eventually what happens if you play

902
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:37,650
it right to its conclusion is that one 
person ends up with all the money,

903
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:38,903
so that's to those who have everything 
more will be given from those who have 

904
00:46:42,031 --> 00:46:43,500
nothing.
Everything will be taken.

905
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,513
That's the law of economic productivity.
It's called Matthew is the matthew 

906
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:51,030
principle and it's actually an economic 
principle that was derived from a saying

907
00:46:51,031 --> 00:46:51,864
in the New Testament.
I'll tell you some more about this on 

908
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,490
Tuesday because I didn't get through all
of it and I want to.

909
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,880
I want to finish up the performance 
prediction lecture and show you a couple

910
00:47:01,921 --> 00:47:03,210
of things.
I didn't get to show you

911
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:06,383
the last time that we talked and then I 
want to do the closing lecture since 

912
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:11,993
we're done today,
so we'll start with the performance 

913
00:47:16,621 --> 00:47:17,454
prediction and so I've been thinking 
more about this prieto distribution 

914
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:24,720
issue because it's a really big deal and
it's difficult.

915
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,670
It's still difficult for me to 
understand and see.

916
00:47:26,671 --> 00:47:28,650
I didn't really learn about this about 
10 years ago,

917
00:47:28,651 --> 00:47:30,220
which is quite a shock to me because

918
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:31,383
it's such a fundamental phenomenon that 
it seems to me that it would have been 

919
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:36,940
addressed in my training somewhere along
the way and so

920
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,113
and so.
I'm still thinking it through what it 

921
00:47:40,871 --> 00:47:41,800
means exactly.
Now,

922
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,930
here's,
here's an interesting thing.

923
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:47,230
You know,
that Iq is normally distributed and it's

924
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,064
a good predictor of long term 
performance and conscientiousness is 

925
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,890
normally distributed and it's a good 
predictor of longterm performance and an

926
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:55,733
openness is also normally distributed 
and it's a good predictor of creative 

927
00:47:59,411 --> 00:48:00,244
behavior,
but creative output is not normally 

928
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:03,814
distributed.
It's distributed in this weird prieto 

929
00:48:05,111 --> 00:48:05,944
distribution that that's indexed here.
And I showed you that with the creative 

930
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:09,634
achievement questionnaire most 
specifically because that provides a 

931
00:48:11,261 --> 00:48:13,550
really concrete example of it.
Um,

932
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,213
so it looks like the capacity to think 
creatively might be normally 

933
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:18,604
distributed.
That would be openness say and 

934
00:48:19,601 --> 00:48:20,434
intelligence.
But the consequence of that turns into 

935
00:48:22,751 --> 00:48:24,310
this strange prieto distribution.

936
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,970
And the credo distribution with regards 
to creative achievement was best.

937
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:29,223
The catastrophe of it in some senses 
best indexed by the fact that if I 

938
00:48:33,131 --> 00:48:33,964
remember correctly,
70 percent of people who complete the 

939
00:48:36,701 --> 00:48:37,534
creative achievement questionnaire,
which indexes lifetime creativity score 

940
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,650
zero.
So zero is a strange number.

941
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:46,450
You know,
zero isn't like other numbers.

942
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:47,613
And the part of the reason for that is 
that it's difficult to do anything with 

943
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:52,710
nothing.
So you know,

944
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:55,300
if you,
if you buy a stock and the and the price

945
00:48:55,301 --> 00:48:59,140
sinks to like two cents a stock,
you're still alive.

946
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,600
But if the price sinks to zero,
you're done.

947
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:02,463
Right?
That's it.

948
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,390
The game's over.
And that's the thing about zero when you

949
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,680
hit zero or maybe when you're at zero,
the game is over.

950
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,150
And when,
when,

951
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:15,010
when we were attempting to market,
for example,

952
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,790
the tests that we had designed to 
predict performance in companies,

953
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:19,863
one of the big obstacles to begin with 
was having zero customers and zero 

954
00:49:22,841 --> 00:49:25,300
customers is really the wrong number of 
customers to have.

955
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,990
And there's a big difference between 
zero customers then one customer,

956
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,430
right?
Because then you're in the game.

957
00:49:30,431 --> 00:49:31,264
But.
And so there's these weird barriers to 

958
00:49:32,921 --> 00:49:34,690
moving forward in life.
And you see this,

959
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:36,790
there's a poverty trap that's sort of 
like this too.

960
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:37,624
Like if you're,
if you're so broke that you can't keep 

961
00:49:39,221 --> 00:49:41,500
up with paying your bills.
It's really,

962
00:49:41,501 --> 00:49:44,230
really difficult to get out of that 
because you can't get a bank account,

963
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,150
for example,
and you can't pay your rent.

964
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:47,950
And there's,
there's,

965
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:48,823
there's economies of scale that you 
can't take advantage of because you 

966
00:49:51,611 --> 00:49:55,060
don't have any money at all and so you 
can't get going in the game.

967
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:58,300
And then so there's the problem of 
starting out with zero,

968
00:49:58,301 --> 00:50:00,700
which is a big problem and very 
difficult to get out of.

969
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,713
And then there's the problem of falling 
to zero if you are in the game because 

970
00:50:04,211 --> 00:50:05,044
when you fall to zero,
that it's very difficult to get going 

971
00:50:06,641 --> 00:50:07,474
again.

972
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,370
And so.
All right,

973
00:50:09,371 --> 00:50:14,260
so now I want to show you something 
about how,

974
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:16,740
how trading games work.
Um,

975
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:21,070
so I think we stopped,
we closed with this last time,

976
00:50:21,071 --> 00:50:21,904
but so this is a,
this is a graph that shows you how a 

977
00:50:24,911 --> 00:50:25,744
monopoly game starts roughly speaking,
but you could say this is how you would 

978
00:50:28,341 --> 00:50:30,350
set up the world if you wanted perfect 
equity.

979
00:50:30,351 --> 00:50:32,150
If you wanted everybody to have the same
outcome,

980
00:50:32,151 --> 00:50:34,640
everybody would have the same amount of 
money.

981
00:50:34,641 --> 00:50:39,080
In this case it's $10.
And so it's dollars along the,

982
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,033
along the bottom axis.
And it's number of players along the 

983
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:43,880
lefthand day.
Oxys.

984
00:50:43,881 --> 00:50:45,950
And you can think about this as a 
monopoly game.

985
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:46,784
Everybody starts with the same amount of
money and then you start trading 

986
00:50:48,441 --> 00:50:51,500
randomly and you know if,
if,

987
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,410
if you have $10 in your trading,
a dollar each trade,

988
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,053
if you have enough people,
some unlucky person is going to end up 

989
00:50:57,591 --> 00:51:00,200
with $0 after 10 traits.

990
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:03,260
And if they end up with $1 after nine 
trades,

991
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:05,780
they still have the chance of recovery.
It's a low chance,

992
00:51:05,781 --> 00:51:08,090
but it's not zero.
But once they hit zero,

993
00:51:08,091 --> 00:51:08,924
they're out of the game.
And so what happens is if you run this 

994
00:51:10,431 --> 00:51:13,550
simulation,
you have people flip a coin to determine

995
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:16,280
how they're going to trade,
then this is what happened.

996
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,114
So the first thing that happens is you 
generate a normal distribution because 

997
00:51:19,941 --> 00:51:20,774
some people win and some people lose.
And most people sort of half women and 

998
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:25,400
half lose.
But some lose continually.

999
00:51:25,401 --> 00:51:26,234
And some wind continually.
And so it turns into a normal 

1000
00:51:27,801 --> 00:51:29,390
distribution.
That's fine.

1001
00:51:29,391 --> 00:51:31,790
But then when the game continues to 
play,

1002
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:36,350
then what happens is that people start 
to stack up on the zero end of things.

1003
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,273
And a tiny proportion at the upper end 
and if you play the game right to 

1004
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:41,780
cessation,
which is what you do,

1005
00:51:41,781 --> 00:51:43,730
if you play monopoly,
for example,

1006
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,400
somebody ends up with all the money.

1007
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,980
And the funny thing about playing 
monopoly as you know,

1008
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:50,990
if you've played monopoly multiple 
times,

1009
00:51:50,991 --> 00:51:54,980
is that the probability that you'll win 
continually across games is pretty low.

1010
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,153
You know,
there's a lot of randomness in monopoly 

1011
00:51:57,471 --> 00:51:59,330
and if you play with the same five 
people,

1012
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:01,520
10 games,
the probability is pretty good.

1013
00:52:01,521 --> 00:52:03,110
You're not going to win more than two 
games.

1014
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:04,303
So.
So there's chance elements that come 

1015
00:52:06,321 --> 00:52:09,500
into play that determine the outcome.
And so anyways,

1016
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:10,334
I was thinking about this more,
a little bit more last night and 

1017
00:52:13,011 --> 00:52:15,530
somebody asked me,
I was talking about it with somebody and

1018
00:52:15,531 --> 00:52:16,364
uh,
he asked me if the Prieto distribution 

1019
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:23,350
was a necessary consequence of the fact 
that production is number one measured.

1020
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:25,520
And number two,
social.

1021
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:26,923
And that's that.
I thought that was really interesting 

1022
00:52:28,191 --> 00:52:29,024
question.
It's like,

1023
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:30,163
do you get a prieto distribution every 
time creative output ends up being 

1024
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:35,030
measured in some way.

1025
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:38,790
And even if you can conceptualize it,
so because it might be the,

1026
00:52:38,791 --> 00:52:43,791
the idea might be that anything that you
can assign monetary value to is first of

1027
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:44,894
all,
is something you can measure because 

1028
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:49,430
assigning monetary value to something is
in fact measuring it,

1029
00:52:49,431 --> 00:52:50,264
right?
You're measuring it with money and then 

1030
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,720
as soon as you assign a monetary value 
to it,

1031
00:52:53,721 --> 00:52:55,010
you can,
you can trade,

1032
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:55,873
you can trade it.
And it also takes on some aspects of a 

1033
00:52:57,771 --> 00:52:58,604
zero sum game.
And most of the things that we talked 

1034
00:53:00,351 --> 00:53:01,184
about with regards to
the production of Prieto distributions 

1035
00:53:05,121 --> 00:53:09,230
were measured entities.
And we're,

1036
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:11,720
um,
we're,

1037
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,320
we're trading games as well.
So even because I mentioned to you,

1038
00:53:15,321 --> 00:53:17,650
for example,
that number of,

1039
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:18,723
of basketball hoops successfully managed
it by NBA players is praetor 

1040
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:25,070
distributed.
But that's also,

1041
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:26,130
those are measurable with

1042
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,440
money because of course you get paid to 
do it and it's,

1043
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:29,383
it is a social game.
And so maybe it is an inevitable 

1044
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:34,650
consequence of trading in a social game 
that you produce preload cubs.

1045
00:53:34,651 --> 00:53:35,484
And then I was trying to figure out why.
And I've also always had this suspicion 

1046
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:42,540
that what happens to people is that as 
they move toward zero,

1047
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,870
positive feedback loops get set up so 
they're more likely to hit zero.

1048
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,913
And as they move away from zero positive
feedback loops get set up so that 

1049
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:52,050
they're increasingly more likely to move
away from zero.

1050
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:55,830
So here's an example.
Let's say you're not doing too bad,

1051
00:53:55,831 --> 00:53:57,540
so maybe you're in the middle of the 
normal distribution,

1052
00:53:57,541 --> 00:54:00,060
then you lose your job.
Okay?

1053
00:54:00,061 --> 00:54:00,894
And so let's say you're a conscientious 
person and we could say just for the 

1054
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:05,994
sake of argument,
that you lose your job because of mass 

1055
00:54:07,261 --> 00:54:08,310
layoffs in your company.

1056
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:10,770
So it has nothing to do with you.
It's fundamentally,

1057
00:54:10,771 --> 00:54:14,040
it's just luck of the draw basically.
But then what happens to you?

1058
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:16,890
Well,
if you're conscientious,

1059
00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:17,820
you're gonna,
you're gonna.

1060
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:20,080
Go after yourself pretty hard.
So you're going to,

1061
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:22,800
especially if you're also high in 
neuroticism,

1062
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,540
it's going to depress you to lose your 
job.

1063
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:26,580
And maybe you're in a situation where 
you just,

1064
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:27,653
for one reason or another,
you don't have that many other 

1065
00:54:28,741 --> 00:54:30,720
opportunities.
Now maybe you should look for them,

1066
00:54:30,721 --> 00:54:31,554
but maybe you're in a depressed state of
the economy or you're geographically 

1067
00:54:34,861 --> 00:54:37,920
located somewhere that makes moving 
difficult or so on and so forth.

1068
00:54:37,921 --> 00:54:38,731
You know,
so,

1069
00:54:38,731 --> 00:54:42,630
but you lose a job and then you start to
get depressed because of that.

1070
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:45,090
Well,
then as you start to get depressed,

1071
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,240
you know it decreases the probability 
that you're going to look for a job,

1072
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,313
but also maybe starts to put stress on 
your family and it also starts to 

1073
00:54:52,351 --> 00:54:53,184
decrease the probability that you're 
going to engage in positive social 

1074
00:54:55,441 --> 00:54:56,010
interaction.

1075
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:59,910
So now not only are you unemployed and 
suffering from economic stress,

1076
00:54:59,911 --> 00:55:00,744
but your marriage is starting to suffer 
and you're starting to isolate yourself 

1077
00:55:03,661 --> 00:55:04,890
from your friends.
And then of course,

1078
00:55:04,891 --> 00:55:06,960
as your marriage suffers in the stress 
builds up,

1079
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,093
then that's gonna make you more 
depressed and that's going to keep you 

1080
00:55:09,571 --> 00:55:10,404
even farther away from your friends.
And that's going to decrease the 

1081
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:12,684
likelihood that you're going to have 
enough positive emotion and enthusiasm 

1082
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:17,130
to look for another job.
And then,

1083
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:18,093
you know,
maybe you want to add a bit of a 

1084
00:55:18,661 --> 00:55:19,494
drinking problem too.
That just for fun and you can see that 

1085
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,540
you can get a spiral going that's just 
taken you down.

1086
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:25,853
Right,
and it's all sorts of things because 

1087
00:55:27,181 --> 00:55:28,014
lots of times people conceptualize,
let's say you're unemployed guide and 

1088
00:55:32,251 --> 00:55:33,084
you go to counseling and you get a 
diagnosis of depression and the thing 

1089
00:55:38,131 --> 00:55:38,964
about a diagnosis of depression,
it's sort of like the assumption is 

1090
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:43,710
there's something gone wrong with your 
psychological structure.

1091
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,710
It's like if you're unemployed and 
you're,

1092
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,120
you're depressed.
It isn't obvious at all that the problem

1093
00:55:48,121 --> 00:55:50,430
is in your head.
You know what I mean?

1094
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:51,140
It's.
It doesn't.

1095
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,580
It isn't even obvious that it's a 
psychological problem.

1096
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,940
It's just a problem and problems can 
take you out.

1097
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:58,810
And so the.
You know,

1098
00:55:58,830 --> 00:55:59,663
if you're unemployed and you're under 
economic stress and your marriage is 

1099
00:56:02,131 --> 00:56:02,964
starting to shake and you're isolating 
yourself from your friends and you're 

1100
00:56:05,941 --> 00:56:08,130
less likely to be motivated to go look 
for a job.

1101
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:10,890
You can sort of think about that as a 
depressive spiral,

1102
00:56:10,891 --> 00:56:11,724
but you can also think of it as a 
conspiracy in some sense of external 

1103
00:56:15,211 --> 00:56:16,044
forces that are auguring you into the 
ground and we don't tend to 

1104
00:56:18,781 --> 00:56:21,660
conceptualize psychological disorders 
that way,

1105
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:26,260
but we should because lots of times when
people are suffering from something that

1106
00:56:26,261 --> 00:56:27,094
you could describe in psychological 
terminology and depression is a very 

1107
00:56:30,071 --> 00:56:30,910
good example of that.

1108
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,100
It isn't obvious that there's something 
wrong with them.

1109
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:37,000
Psychologically.
Often they just are in trouble and there

1110
00:56:37,001 --> 00:56:42,001
isn't a category in psychological 
diagnosis for client in serious trouble.

1111
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:43,083
But my experience has been almost 
without exception that the people that 

1112
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:51,190
come to see me come to see me because 
something's gone wrong with their life.

1113
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,780
Not because they have a psychological 
problem.

1114
00:56:52,781 --> 00:56:53,710
Now you could say,
well,

1115
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:57,970
there are psychological inadequacies 
such as they might be,

1116
00:56:57,971 --> 00:56:58,804
are interfering with their ability to 
recover or maybe even served as 

1117
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:03,150
precursors to,
you know,

1118
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:05,380
increase the probability of the 
catastrophe,

1119
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:08,650
but it's still not exactly the 
appropriate way to conceptualize it.

1120
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,510
And you know,
because you're,

1121
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,790
you inside you.
And as a personality psychologist and as

1122
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:15,624
a clinical theorists,
most of what I've talked to you guys 

1123
00:57:17,381 --> 00:57:18,214
about is your psyche and its structure 
as if it was like a soul that inhabited 

1124
00:57:22,991 --> 00:57:23,320
you.

1125
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,180
And there's some real utility in that.
You know,

1126
00:57:25,181 --> 00:57:27,670
you're an individual demarcated from the
community.

1127
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,820
You can be set up in a healthy manner,
an unhealthy manner.

1128
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,430
The problem with that is that you're not
just an individual,

1129
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:34,443
you're connected to all these external 
network dynamic networks that are 

1130
00:57:37,451 --> 00:57:38,530
really,
really important.

1131
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,230
And it isn't even easy to separate them 
from,

1132
00:57:41,231 --> 00:57:42,700
you know,
like you might say,

1133
00:57:42,701 --> 00:57:46,330
well this is especially true once you 
become a parent is like,

1134
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,380
is your child more you than your arm?
You know what you think?

1135
00:57:50,381 --> 00:57:53,050
That's pretty obvious parts of you that 
are physically linked,

1136
00:57:53,051 --> 00:57:57,160
our more key to you to you as an entity,
but it's by no means obvious.

1137
00:57:57,161 --> 00:58:01,660
I think many people would much more 
happily sacrifice at arm than a child.

1138
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:02,543
You know.
And so your boundaries are not where 

1139
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,314
your boundaries are located,
are not precisely isomorphic with the 

1140
00:58:08,081 --> 00:58:09,310
outline of your body.

1141
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,173
It's not that simple at all.
And so you're embedded in all sorts of 

1142
00:58:12,101 --> 00:58:15,700
networks that can pull you down rapidly 
or elevate you,

1143
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:17,710
because the other thing that happens is 
that,

1144
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:19,263
well,
let's say I've never traded with anyone 

1145
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,720
and I go up to someone and I say,
well,

1146
00:58:22,721 --> 00:58:24,280
do you want to trade?
And they say,

1147
00:58:24,281 --> 00:58:25,450
well,
why?

1148
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,740
How?
How can I trust you?

1149
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,750
And the answer to that is,
well,

1150
00:58:28,751 --> 00:58:30,850
you have to take my word for it with 
that's not,

1151
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,000
that's not a very good argument.
You might say,

1152
00:58:34,001 --> 00:58:36,460
instead,
well here's what I have to offer and you

1153
00:58:36,461 --> 00:58:38,920
can evaluate it,
but the person is likely to say,

1154
00:58:38,921 --> 00:58:40,510
well,
I don't know how to evaluate it.

1155
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:42,480
And so I'm still stuck with taking your 
work.

1156
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,190
So that's a bad problem.
And you'll see that if you ever tried to

1157
00:58:45,191 --> 00:58:48,130
sell a product in the marketplace is if 
you don't.

1158
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,680
If if the product is new and it's 
complex,

1159
00:58:50,681 --> 00:58:51,514
then you're forcing the person that 
wants to buy it to evaluate it and then 

1160
00:58:54,671 --> 00:58:58,270
you're forcing them to take the risk of 
being wrong as well as the time it would

1161
00:58:58,271 --> 00:59:00,340
take to evaluate it.
And they don't like that.

1162
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:03,400
What they want is what's often called 
social proof,

1163
00:59:03,401 --> 00:59:04,390
which is,
okay,

1164
00:59:04,391 --> 00:59:06,520
well you want to trade with me,
who else have you traded with?

1165
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:10,450
And if the answer is zero,
then they are going to say,

1166
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:11,583
well,
you're an interesting person and all 

1167
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:12,551
that.
But,

1168
00:59:12,551 --> 00:59:13,384
um,
I've got these other people over here 

1169
00:59:14,111 --> 00:59:14,944
who have already traded with a bunch of 
people and therefore the risk is lower 

1170
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:19,563
in part because let's say I have a 
supervisor and I'm going to make a 

1171
00:59:23,421 --> 00:59:24,254
decision.
And my primary concern is that my 

1172
00:59:25,671 --> 00:59:28,190
supervisor will not hate me for making 
the decision.

1173
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,233
It's not my,
that my primary concern is to make the 

1174
00:59:30,711 --> 00:59:33,140
best decision.
It's not the same thing.

1175
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,740
It's that I want to make a decision that
I'm not going to get in trouble for,

1176
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,960
okay,
so how do I do that?

1177
00:59:38,961 --> 00:59:42,500
Because I need a post hoc justification 
so I buy something from you and it turns

1178
00:59:42,501 --> 00:59:44,310
out to be terrible.
And,

1179
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,480
and I get called for it,
called on the table for it.

1180
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:48,860
And what do I say?
I say,

1181
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:49,810
well,
you know,

1182
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:53,000
that person was buying from it and that 
person was buying from,

1183
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:55,190
from,
from him and that person was buying from

1184
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:57,650
him like all these other people were 
doing the same thing.

1185
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,753
So it's not like the error is localized 
in me and that's often a very credible 

1186
01:00:02,361 --> 01:00:04,520
story.
But if the answer is,

1187
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:05,121
well,
you know,

1188
01:00:05,121 --> 01:00:06,770
I,
I evaluated it and took A.

1189
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:07,880
Rick decided to take a risk.

1190
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:11,070
It's like out the door with you sunny,
because you know,

1191
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:12,103
that's just,
that's an indication that you're not 

1192
01:00:13,461 --> 01:00:14,294
capable of doing that sort of thing.
So I think part of the reason that 

1193
01:00:17,421 --> 01:00:22,421
people spiral downhill into zero is 
because Paul positive,

1194
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:23,893
like a positive feedback loop is a loop 
that increases the probability that the 

1195
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,520
loop will continue,
right?

1196
01:00:28,521 --> 01:00:29,354
A positive feedback loop is you've 
experienced this when you hear 

1197
01:00:31,311 --> 01:00:33,650
microphone feedback in an amplified 
system.

1198
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:34,933
So you know the microphone sends a 
message to the speakers and then the 

1199
01:00:38,421 --> 01:00:39,254
speakers send out the message amplified 
and then the microphone picks up the 

1200
01:00:43,101 --> 01:00:46,850
message and and it gets amplified again 
and you get this howling occur,

1201
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,833
which is can be deafening but can also 
destroy the system because it'll keep 

1202
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,820
amplifying upward until the speakers 
blow,

1203
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:53,953
for example.
That's a positive feedback loop and a 

1204
01:00:55,911 --> 01:00:59,900
positive feedback loop can spiral you 
upward or it can spiral you downward.

1205
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,153
And so a virtuous circle,
a virtuous positive feedback loop is 

1206
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,571
when,
well,

1207
01:01:05,571 --> 01:01:06,404
I've traded with him and I've traded 
with him and I've traded with him and 

1208
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:09,764
now I can say to you,
I've traded with these three people and 

1209
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:14,630
you go talk to them when they say good 
things and so then you say,

1210
01:01:14,631 --> 01:01:15,620
well,
I'll trade with you.

1211
01:01:15,621 --> 01:01:16,454
And then because of that,
then you're even more likely to trade 

1212
01:01:18,351 --> 01:01:20,810
with me.
And it's like the thing starts to spiral

1213
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:23,930
uphill and it does that.
I think in a nonlinear form.

1214
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,333
And so because one of the things you 
guys are going to be asking yourself as 

1215
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:28,484
you mature,
because what's happening is that income 

1216
01:01:30,711 --> 01:01:32,480
inequality is increasing,
right?

1217
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:33,650
And you might ask,
well why that?

1218
01:01:33,651 --> 01:01:35,990
Why is that?
The first thing you need to know is that

1219
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:40,430
that's what income does.
So it's not like you need an explanation

1220
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:40,800
for it.

1221
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,370
This is the explanation.
It's like a natural rule.

1222
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:46,880
If you run a trading game to its logical
conclusion,

1223
01:01:46,881 --> 01:01:50,570
one person ends up with all the money 
and everyone else ends up with zero,

1224
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,630
so you don't need an explanation for 
that because that's,

1225
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:57,530
that's it's in the natural order of 
things that that occurs,

1226
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,393
so to speak.
It's a logical consequence of a random 

1227
01:02:00,501 --> 01:02:02,840
trading game with zero.
As one of the polls,

1228
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:05,030
you still might ask yourself,
well,

1229
01:02:05,031 --> 01:02:05,864
what can you do about income inequality?
And that's a perfectly reasonable 

1230
01:02:08,421 --> 01:02:10,250
question.
And as I said already,

1231
01:02:10,251 --> 01:02:11,084
the answer to that is what's if it's an 
extraordinarily complicated problem to 

1232
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,730
to address,
we don't really know how to address it.

1233
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,580
The only time it's really been 
successfully as far as I can tell,

1234
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:24,060
roughly speaking,
is during the industrial revolution,

1235
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,120
especially in the part of the industrial
revolution that occurred,

1236
01:02:27,121 --> 01:02:31,560
say after World War II in the developing
world where for one reason or another,

1237
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:32,663
it turned out that there were a 
tremendous number of high paying 

1238
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:35,783
industrial jobs that people who,
that people could get access to without 

1239
01:02:40,201 --> 01:02:41,034
having had the fortune,
the good fortune of one of these 

1240
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,030
positive feedback loops working for 
them,

1241
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,820
but those jobs are disappearing very,
very,

1242
01:02:47,821 --> 01:02:50,580
very rapidly and,
and one of the problems is,

1243
01:02:50,581 --> 01:02:51,414
as far as I can tell,
is that computational devices are in 

1244
01:02:54,451 --> 01:02:57,030
intelligence and conscientiousness 
multiplier.

1245
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:58,343
And that's a big problem because the 
more intelligent people are already and 

1246
01:03:00,721 --> 01:03:04,410
more conscientious people are already 
more likely to be tapped up on the,

1247
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:07,950
on the winner's side of the prieto 
distribution.

1248
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:08,890
Then you add,
you know,

1249
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:12,630
if you have an Iq of 150,
let's say you have an Iq of 150,

1250
01:03:12,631 --> 01:03:14,790
you know how to use a computer and you 
live in Silicon Valley.

1251
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,010
So man,
you're a deadly person,

1252
01:03:17,011 --> 01:03:18,330
right?
Because you're super fast,

1253
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:19,164
let's say you're super hard working.
We could also say maybe you're super 

1254
01:03:21,421 --> 01:03:22,254
energetic and healthy because that also 
seems to be a criteria and that is a 

1255
01:03:25,231 --> 01:03:28,680
real important determinant of that kind 
of lifetime hyper success.

1256
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,860
So you need you're way the hell above 
average in ICU.

1257
01:03:31,861 --> 01:03:33,330
You're very,
very industrious.

1258
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:36,000
You know how to use computers.
There are massive,

1259
01:03:36,001 --> 01:03:39,960
insanely massive effort multiplier and 
then you're surrounded by people who are

1260
01:03:39,961 --> 01:03:40,794
super smart.

1261
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:42,810
It's like there's a lot of things going 
for you,

1262
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:43,973
right?
You're going to be moving ahead at an 

1263
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:46,290
awful,
awful rate.

1264
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:47,303
That's again,
why places like Silicon Valley are so 

1265
01:03:49,051 --> 01:03:49,884
damn effective is that they're bringing 
people from all over the world who are 

1266
01:03:52,861 --> 01:03:55,650
like that into one place like silicon 
valley.

1267
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:58,470
I don't know if you guys know about the 
Indian Institute of Technology,

1268
01:03:58,471 --> 01:03:59,304
but it's India's answered to mit and 
it's one hell of an engineering school 

1269
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:06,120
and but a huge number of the graduates 
from India go to Silicon Valley and work

1270
01:04:06,121 --> 01:04:09,630
there mostly as entrepreneurs.
They're very good at being entrepreneurs

1271
01:04:09,631 --> 01:04:10,464
as it turns out,
and they ship money like mad back to 

1272
01:04:12,301 --> 01:04:14,520
India and that's part of what's driving 
the Indian economy.

1273
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:15,354
But it's just another example is that 
because silicon valley is already full 

1274
01:04:18,631 --> 01:04:19,464
of brilliant entrepreneurial people,
then more brilliant and entrepreneurial 

1275
01:04:22,681 --> 01:04:25,740
people from all over the world flock 
there like mad and it's just,

1276
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:30,150
it's one of these cycles that spirals 
upward,

1277
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,620
very,
very difficult to,

1278
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,190
to set that up somewhere else.
And once it gets going,

1279
01:04:35,191 --> 01:04:38,670
it's an unbelievably powerful economic 
engine crazily,

1280
01:04:38,671 --> 01:04:40,620
crazily powerful.
So.

1281
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,003
Okay,
so,

1282
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:48,510
so what's the panoply let's say,
of of predictors that we know of?

1283
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:50,310
Well,
um,

1284
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,270
and so these are determinants of 
lifetime success as far as I can tell.

1285
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:55,613
Uh,
and I would think about this because 

1286
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:00,960
I'll tell you what it is that you need 
to do to be successful.

1287
01:05:00,961 --> 01:05:03,240
Some of these things aren't so 
malleable,

1288
01:05:03,241 --> 01:05:05,100
but others are things that you can work 
on.

1289
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:06,240
Well,
Iq.

1290
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:07,223
Well that's a rough one because there is
no evidence as far as I can tell that 

1291
01:05:11,371 --> 01:05:12,204
you can do a damn thing about your Iq.
I was just reading a paper by Dan Simon 

1292
01:05:15,481 --> 01:05:16,410
today.
Uh,

1293
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:17,244
it's a relatively recent review.
Dan Simon did the invisible gorilla 

1294
01:05:19,511 --> 01:05:20,344
stuff and he was looking because there's
all these companies that claim that 

1295
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:26,350
these online brain training exercises 
can produce cognitive improvements,

1296
01:05:26,351 --> 01:05:27,790
and he reviewed the literature.
Gannon,

1297
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:28,803
I reviewed that literature like six 
times in the last 15 years because I 

1298
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:33,070
keep hoping that someone will crack the 
problem,

1299
01:05:33,071 --> 01:05:34,420
but it's always the same answer.

1300
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:35,253
It's like you do brain training games.
You get better at the game a lot better 

1301
01:05:38,891 --> 01:05:39,724
at that game.
You get slightly better at similar 

1302
01:05:41,621 --> 01:05:42,454
games,
but distal games that are still heavily 

1303
01:05:44,171 --> 01:05:47,920
cognitively loaded doesn't affect your 
performance at all.

1304
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:49,270
Zero.
None.

1305
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:50,990
So the,
the,

1306
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,870
the issue of how to raise Iq,
man,

1307
01:05:52,871 --> 01:05:54,110
that's a killer.
No one knows what,

1308
01:05:54,111 --> 01:05:54,944
how to do it.
I can tell you how to stop your Iq from 

1309
01:05:57,011 --> 01:06:00,820
decreasing as you get older.
That's not so bad because it does that.

1310
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:04,350
A fluid Iq decreases from the time 
you're 20 and,

1311
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,730
and pretty rapidly.
It's a physical.

1312
01:06:06,731 --> 01:06:09,370
Health is the best preventative.
So exercise,

1313
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:11,800
physical exercise,
weirdly enough,

1314
01:06:11,870 --> 01:06:12,703
you know,
you think,

1315
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,570
well,
why?

1316
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:14,403
While your brain uses oxygen like Matt 
right handed and it and it needs to be 

1317
01:06:17,771 --> 01:06:21,400
kept clean and well oxygenated and 
physical exercise,

1318
01:06:21,401 --> 01:06:25,570
both both like weightlifting,
so anaerobic and aerobic,

1319
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:31,180
anaerobic and aerobic exercise both seem
to be very,

1320
01:06:31,181 --> 01:06:36,070
very effective at staving off cognitive 
declines across the lifespan.

1321
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:37,203
So that's a really useful thing to know 
because that's the only thing we know 

1322
01:06:40,061 --> 01:06:40,894
that does that.
So then the next best predictor of 

1323
01:06:43,631 --> 01:06:44,464
lifetime success is conscientiousness.
While so and of the of the two aspects 

1324
01:06:48,731 --> 01:06:52,540
of conscientiousness say orderliness and
industriousness,

1325
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:55,330
the better predictor is industriousness.
So the question is,

1326
01:06:55,331 --> 01:06:56,164
well,
what can you do about your 

1327
01:06:56,681 --> 01:06:58,750
industriousness?
And the answer to that is,

1328
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:02,950
well that's Kinda rough too because 
there's a strong genetic component,

1329
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,143
but you can work on micro habits with 
regards to your conscientiousness and I 

1330
01:07:08,651 --> 01:07:09,484
think the best micro habits.
This is partly to do with this future 

1331
01:07:12,221 --> 01:07:13,054
authoring program processes.
I think the best thing you can do with 

1332
01:07:14,861 --> 01:07:18,760
regards to your conscientiousness is to 
set up some aims for yourself.

1333
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:23,440
Goals that you actually value and the 
future authoring program helps people do

1334
01:07:23,441 --> 01:07:24,274
that.
And basically it does a situational 

1335
01:07:26,441 --> 01:07:27,274
analysis of it helps you do a 
situational analysis of your life more 

1336
01:07:30,701 --> 01:07:32,710
than a psychological analysis,
I would say.

1337
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:34,900
And so the questions are something like,
well,

1338
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,333
alright,
you're going to have to put some effort 

1339
01:07:37,001 --> 01:07:40,600
into your life and you need to be 
motivated to do that.

1340
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,480
And so what are the potential sources of
motivation?

1341
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:46,830
You could think about them in the big 
five manner.

1342
01:07:47,090 --> 01:07:48,520
If you're extroverted,
you want friends,

1343
01:07:48,521 --> 01:07:50,530
if you're agreeable,
you want an intimate relationship.

1344
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:53,200
If you're disagreeable,
you want to win competitions.

1345
01:07:53,201 --> 01:07:56,530
If you're open,
you want to engage in creative activity.

1346
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:58,870
If you're high in neuroticism,
you want security.

1347
01:07:58,900 --> 01:07:59,733
Okay?
So those are all sources of potential 

1348
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:03,940
motivation that you could draw on that 
you could tailor to your own,

1349
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:05,470
you know,
your own personality.

1350
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:08,770
But then there are dimensions that you 
want to consider your life across.

1351
01:08:08,771 --> 01:08:10,990
And so we asked people about,
well,

1352
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,003
you know,
if you could have your life the way you 

1353
01:08:12,611 --> 01:08:13,444
wanted it in three to five years,
if you were taking care of yourself 

1354
01:08:15,441 --> 01:08:16,274
properly,
what would you want from your 

1355
01:08:17,871 --> 01:08:18,470
friendships?

1356
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:20,360
What would you want from your intimate 
relationship?

1357
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:22,010
How would you like to structure your 
family?

1358
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:24,000
What do you want for your career?
Well,

1359
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:24,843
how are you going to use your time 
outside of your job and how are you 

1360
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:29,330
going to regulate your mental,
physical,

1361
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:30,223
mental,
and physical health and maybe also your 

1362
01:08:31,551 --> 01:08:32,384
drug and alcohol use because that's a 
good place to auger down because 

1363
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:38,690
alcoholism for example,
wipes out five to 10 percent of people,

1364
01:08:38,691 --> 01:08:43,691
so you want to keep that under control 
and then and then so maybe you know,

1365
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:47,120
you,
you develop a vision of what your life,

1366
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:51,500
what you would like your life to be and 
that associates the.

1367
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:52,903
So the goal,
once the goal is established and then 

1368
01:08:54,471 --> 01:08:58,160
you break down the goal into micro 
processes that you can implement,

1369
01:08:58,520 --> 01:08:59,353
the microprocesses become rewarding in 
proportion in relation to their causal 

1370
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,990
association with the goal and that 
tangles in your,

1371
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:09,740
your incentive reward system.

1372
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:10,573
You know,
we talked about the dopaminergic 

1373
01:09:11,391 --> 01:09:12,224
incentive reward system,
but that's the thing that keeps you 

1374
01:09:13,581 --> 01:09:14,414
moving forward.
And the way it works is that it works 

1375
01:09:16,251 --> 01:09:17,084
better if it produces positive emotion.
When it can see you moving towards a 

1376
01:09:21,621 --> 01:09:23,090
valued goal,
okay,

1377
01:09:23,091 --> 01:09:23,924
well what's the implication of that?
Better have a valued goal because 

1378
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:30,080
otherwise you can't get any positive 
motivation working out.

1379
01:09:30,081 --> 01:09:32,660
And so the more valuable the goal in 
principle,

1380
01:09:32,661 --> 01:09:33,494
the more the microprocessor is 
associated with that goal start to take 

1381
01:09:36,591 --> 01:09:37,424
on a positive charge.
And so what that means is while you get 

1382
01:09:39,831 --> 01:09:41,760
up in the morning and you're excited 
about today,

1383
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:44,150
you're ready to go.
And so as far as I can tell,

1384
01:09:44,151 --> 01:09:47,540
what you do is you specify your longterm
ideal.

1385
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:49,063
Maybe you also specify a place you want 
to stay the hell away from so that 

1386
01:09:51,381 --> 01:09:52,214
you're terrified to fail as well as 
excited about succeeding because that's 

1387
01:09:55,341 --> 01:09:56,180
also useful.

1388
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:59,060
You specify your goal.
You do that.

1389
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:02,210
You do that in some sense as a unique 
individual.

1390
01:10:02,211 --> 01:10:03,044
You want to.
You want to specify goals that make you 

1391
01:10:04,551 --> 01:10:05,570
say,
Oh,

1392
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:08,450
if that could happen as a consequence of
my efforts,

1393
01:10:08,451 --> 01:10:11,990
it would clearly be worthwhile.
Because the question always is,

1394
01:10:11,991 --> 01:10:14,540
why do something?
Because doing nothing is easy.

1395
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:16,880
You just sit there and you don't do 
anything that's real easy.

1396
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:19,070
The question is why would you ever do 
anything?

1397
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:20,413
And the answer that has to be because 
you've determined by some means that 

1398
01:10:23,481 --> 01:10:26,180
it's worthwhile.
And then the next question might be,

1399
01:10:26,181 --> 01:10:27,014
well,
where should you look for worthwhile 

1400
01:10:27,981 --> 01:10:29,300
things and one would be,
well,

1401
01:10:29,301 --> 01:10:30,134
you could consult your own temperament 
and the other would be while you kinda 

1402
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:33,943
look at how,
look at what it is that people accrue 

1403
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:39,470
that's valuable across the lifespan.
Look,

1404
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:40,333
look what?
So you do a structural analysis of the 

1405
01:10:42,741 --> 01:10:45,770
subcomponents of human existence and 
already did that.

1406
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,020
You need a family.
You need friends,

1407
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:49,490
like you don't need to have all of these
things,

1408
01:10:49,491 --> 01:10:51,530
but you better have most of them.
Family,

1409
01:10:51,531 --> 01:10:52,490
friends,
career,

1410
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:56,600
educational goals,
plans for time outside of work,

1411
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:59,390
attention to your mental and physical 
health,

1412
01:10:59,391 --> 01:11:01,910
etc. You know those are,
that's what life is about.

1413
01:11:01,911 --> 01:11:04,610
And if You don't have any of those 
things,

1414
01:11:04,611 --> 01:11:07,190
well then all you've got left is misery 
and suffering.

1415
01:11:07,191 --> 01:11:11,060
So that's a bad.
That's a bad deal for you.

1416
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:14,310
So,
so once you bought,

1417
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:16,980
once you set up that goal structure,
let's say,

1418
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:17,814
and that's really in many in many ways,
that's what you should be doing at 

1419
01:11:20,581 --> 01:11:21,414
universities.
That's exactly what you should be doing 

1420
01:11:23,011 --> 01:11:26,700
is trying to figure out who it is that 
you're trying to be,

1421
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:28,523
right,
and the aim at that and then use 

1422
01:11:30,781 --> 01:11:31,614
everything you learned as a means of 
building that person that you want to 

1423
01:11:34,561 --> 01:11:34,830
be.

1424
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:35,663
And and I really mean want to be,
I don't mean should be even those 

1425
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:39,624
things,
those things are going to overlap and 

1426
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,100
it's important to distinguish between 
those because that's partly,

1427
01:11:44,101 --> 01:11:46,290
and this is back down to the micro 
routine analysis.

1428
01:11:46,291 --> 01:11:47,041
So I started saying,
well,

1429
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:48,750
you're going to try to make yourself 
more industrious.

1430
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:49,711
Okay?
Number one,

1431
01:11:49,711 --> 01:11:50,544
specify your damn goals because how are 
you going to hit something if you don't 

1432
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:54,810
know what it is that isn't going to 
happen.

1433
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:55,943
And often people won't specify their 
goals too because they don't like to 

1434
01:11:58,051 --> 01:11:58,884
specify conditions for failure.
So if you keep yourself all vague and 

1435
01:12:01,591 --> 01:12:04,200
foggy,
which is real easy because that's just a

1436
01:12:04,201 --> 01:12:05,034
matter of not doing as well,
then you don't know when you fail and 

1437
01:12:07,981 --> 01:12:08,701
people might say,
well,

1438
01:12:08,701 --> 01:12:11,210
I really don't want to know when I fail 
because that's painful,

1439
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:14,070
so I'll keep myself blind about when I 
fail.

1440
01:12:14,310 --> 01:12:16,200
ThAt's fine,
except you'll fail all the time.

1441
01:12:16,201 --> 01:12:20,070
Then you just won't know it until you 
failed so badly that you're done.

1442
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:22,710
And that can easily happen by the time 
you're 40.

1443
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:24,323
So.
So I would recommend that you don't let 

1444
01:12:26,251 --> 01:12:28,290
that happen.
So that's willful blindness,

1445
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:29,580
right?
You could have known,

1446
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:31,590
but you chose not to.
Okay.

1447
01:12:31,591 --> 01:12:33,540
So once you get your goal structure set 
up,

1448
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:34,111
you think,
okay,

1449
01:12:34,111 --> 01:12:34,944
if I could have this life looks like 
that might be worth living despite the 

1450
01:12:38,071 --> 01:12:39,720
fact that it's going to be,
you know,

1451
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:40,853
anxiety provoking and threatening,
and there's gonna be some suffering and 

1452
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,584
loss involved and all of that.
Obviously the goal is to have a vision 

1453
01:12:47,371 --> 01:12:52,371
for your life such that all things 
considered that justifies your effort.

1454
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:54,840
Okay?
So then what do you do?

1455
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,270
Well then then you turned down to the 
micro routines.

1456
01:12:58,271 --> 01:12:58,711
It's like,
okay,

1457
01:12:58,711 --> 01:12:59,850
well this is what I'm aiming for.

1458
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:03,120
How does that instantiate itself day to 
day,

1459
01:13:03,121 --> 01:13:04,470
week to week,
month to month,

1460
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:07,920
and that's where something like a 
schedule can be unbelievably useful.

1461
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:11,430
google calendar.
It's like make a damn schedule and stick

1462
01:13:11,431 --> 01:13:12,450
to it.
Okay,

1463
01:13:12,451 --> 01:13:15,720
so what's the rule with the schedule?
It's not a bloody prison.

1464
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:18,180
That's the first thing that people do 
wrong.

1465
01:13:18,181 --> 01:13:18,451
He said,
well,

1466
01:13:18,451 --> 01:13:20,910
I don't like to follow a schedule.
And it's like,

1467
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:21,833
well,
what kind of schedule are you setting 

1468
01:13:22,591 --> 01:13:23,424
up?
Well I,

1469
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,350
I have to do this,
then I have to do this,

1470
01:13:25,351 --> 01:13:26,870
then I have to do this,
you know?

1471
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,790
And then I just go play video games 
because who wants to do all these things

1472
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:31,710
that I have to do?
It's like wrong.

1473
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:35,940
Set the damn schedule up so that you 
have the day you want.

1474
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:37,680
That's the trick.
It's like,

1475
01:13:37,681 --> 01:13:38,850
okay,
I've got tomorrow.

1476
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:39,893
If I was going to set it up so it was 
the best possible day I could have 

1477
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,650
practically speaking,
what would it look like?

1478
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:48,023
Well then you schedule that and 
obviously there's a bit of 

1479
01:13:49,651 --> 01:13:53,040
responsibility that's going to go along 
with that because if you have any sense,

1480
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:54,143
one of the things that you're going to 
insist upon is that at the end of the 

1481
01:13:56,850 --> 01:13:57,683
day,
you're not in worse shape than you were 

1482
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:00,990
then at the beginning of the day,
right?

1483
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:04,350
Because that's a stupid day.
If you have a bunch of thoSe in a row,

1484
01:14:04,351 --> 01:14:06,330
you just dig,
dig yourself a hole,

1485
01:14:06,331 --> 01:14:08,040
and then you bury yourself in.
It's like,

1486
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:10,200
sorry,
that's just not a good strategy.

1487
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:11,363
It's a bad strategy.
So maybe Twenty percent of your day has 

1488
01:14:14,411 --> 01:14:17,350
to be responsibility and obligation,
or maybe it's more than that,

1489
01:14:17,351 --> 01:14:20,200
depending on how far behind you are,
but even that you can.

1490
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:21,640
You can ask yourself,
okay,

1491
01:14:21,641 --> 01:14:25,510
well I've got these responsibilities.
I have to schedule the damn things in.

1492
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:29,080
What's the right ratio of responsibility
to reward?

1493
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,153
And you can ask yourself that just like 
you'd negotiate with someone who is 

1494
01:14:32,411 --> 01:14:33,040
working for you.

1495
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:33,551
It'S like,
okay,

1496
01:14:33,551 --> 01:14:35,350
you gotta work tomorrow.
Okay,

1497
01:14:35,351 --> 01:14:37,600
so I want you to work tomorrow.
And you might say,

1498
01:14:37,601 --> 01:14:38,434
okay,
well what are you going to do for me 

1499
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:43,810
that makes it likely that I'll work for 
you while you could ask yourself that,

1500
01:14:43,811 --> 01:14:44,644
you know,
maybe do an hour of of responsibility 

1501
01:14:47,531 --> 01:14:49,360
and then you play a video game for 15 
minutes.

1502
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:51,370
I don't know,
whatever turns your crank man,

1503
01:14:51,371 --> 01:14:52,204
but you know,
you have to negotiate with yourself and 

1504
01:14:54,491 --> 01:14:55,324
not tyrannized yourself like you're 
negotiating with someone that you care 

1505
01:14:59,021 --> 01:15:01,990
for that you would like to be productive
and have a good life.

1506
01:15:01,991 --> 01:15:04,380
And that's how you make the schedule.
It's like.

1507
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:05,620
And then you look at the day and you 
think,

1508
01:15:05,621 --> 01:15:06,610
well,
if I had that day,

1509
01:15:06,611 --> 01:15:08,500
that'd be good.
Great.

1510
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:09,550
You know,
and you,

1511
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:10,383
you're useless and horrible.
So you'll probably only hit it with 

1512
01:15:12,011 --> 01:15:15,730
about 70 percent accuracy,
but that beats the hell out of zero.

1513
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:17,283
Right?
And if you hit it even with 50 percent 

1514
01:15:18,701 --> 01:15:20,860
accuracy,
another rule is well,

1515
01:15:20,861 --> 01:15:25,630
aim for 51 percent the next week or 50 
and a half percent for god's sake.

1516
01:15:25,631 --> 01:15:30,400
Or because you're gonna hit that 
position where things start to loop back

1517
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:33,580
positively in spiral you upward.
And so,

1518
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:37,690
so that's one way that you can work on 
your conscientiousness is a plan,

1519
01:15:37,691 --> 01:15:38,524
a life you'd like to have,
and and you do that partly by referring 

1520
01:15:42,551 --> 01:15:45,550
to social norms.
That's more or less rescuing your father

1521
01:15:45,551 --> 01:15:46,384
from the belly of the whale,
but the other way you do that is by 

1522
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:49,413
having a little conversation with 
yourself about as if you don't really 

1523
01:15:52,571 --> 01:15:54,490
know who you are,
because you know what you're like.

1524
01:15:54,491 --> 01:15:55,324
You won't do what you're told.
You won't do what you tell yourself to 

1525
01:15:57,581 --> 01:15:59,590
do.
You must have noticed that.

1526
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:00,843
It's like you're a bad employee and a 
worse boss and both of those work for 

1527
01:16:05,381 --> 01:16:06,100
you.

1528
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:06,933
You don't know what you want to do.
And then when you tell yourself what to 

1529
01:16:08,351 --> 01:16:09,400
do,
you don't do it anyways.

1530
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,920
You should fire yourself and find 
someone else to beat.

1531
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:13,093
But,
but my point is that you have to 

1532
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:17,950
understand that you're not your own 
servant,

1533
01:16:17,951 --> 01:16:18,784
so to speak.
You're someone that you have to 

1534
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:20,374
negotiate with and that's someone that 
you want to present the opportunity of 

1535
01:16:25,151 --> 01:16:25,984
having a good life too.
And that's hard for people because they 

1536
01:16:27,881 --> 01:16:30,700
don't like themselves very much,
so you know,

1537
01:16:30,701 --> 01:16:31,534
they're always like cracking the whip 
and then procrastinating and cracking 

1538
01:16:34,331 --> 01:16:36,130
the whip and then procrastinating and 
it's like,

1539
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:36,993
god,
it's so boring and such a pathetic way 

1540
01:16:39,251 --> 01:16:40,084
of spending your time.
And you know what that's like because 

1541
01:16:41,171 --> 01:16:42,004
you probably waste like six hours a day.
And I think we did an economic 

1542
01:16:44,621 --> 01:16:46,510
calculation about that a while back,
right?

1543
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:48,580
your time is probably worth 50 bucks an 
hour,

1544
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:50,110
something like that.
I mean,

1545
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:52,720
you're not getting paid that now,
but you're young.

1546
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:53,823
And so this is investment time and what 
you do now is going to multiply its 

1547
01:16:57,341 --> 01:16:58,570
effects in the future.
So,

1548
01:16:58,930 --> 01:17:01,750
so let's say it's 50 bucks an hour,
which is perfectly reasonable.

1549
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:04,060
So if you waste six hours a day and you 
are,

1550
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:07,870
then you're wasting about $2,000 a week 
or about $100,000 a year.

1551
01:17:07,871 --> 01:17:11,120
So like go ahead.
That's what it's costing you every hour.

1552
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:13,310
And you need to know what your damn time
is worth.

1553
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,680
So let's say it's not 50 bucks,
it's 30,

1554
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,720
whatever,
maybe it's a hundred,

1555
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:18,554
it's somewhere in that range.
One of The things that you should be 

1556
01:17:20,211 --> 01:17:23,180
asking yourself is when you spend an 
hour was that,

1557
01:17:23,181 --> 01:17:24,014
well,
what have I paid someone 50 bucks to 

1558
01:17:25,761 --> 01:17:28,250
have had that hour?
And if that answer is no,

1559
01:17:28,251 --> 01:17:29,084
it's like,
well maybe you should do something else 

1560
01:17:30,021 --> 01:17:30,854
with your time.

1561
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:34,130
And it depends on whether or not you 
think that your time is worthwhile.

1562
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:35,713
But the funny thing about not assuming 
that is if you assume your time isn't 

1563
01:17:38,241 --> 01:17:39,074
worthwhile,
what happens is you don't just sit 

1564
01:17:40,821 --> 01:17:44,990
around sort of randomly in a state of 
responsibility lists bliss.

1565
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:46,123
What you do is you suffer existentially 
and so that seems like a stupid 

1566
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:52,280
solution.
So okay.

1567
01:17:52,281 --> 01:17:54,770
So anyways,
as far as I can tell,

1568
01:17:54,771 --> 01:17:56,780
that's how you can improve your 
conscientiousness.

1569
01:17:57,050 --> 01:17:57,883
Hit an outline and goal that you 
actually would like to hit and even 

1570
01:18:02,421 --> 01:18:03,254
better,
here's something else you can think 

1571
01:18:04,281 --> 01:18:06,290
about when you're negotiating in your 
life.

1572
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:08,510
You could say if you're going to 
pessimistic,

1573
01:18:08,511 --> 01:18:09,201
you'd say,
well,

1574
01:18:09,201 --> 01:18:11,720
we have to negotiate an agreement.
I'd like to walk away,

1575
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:14,780
not miserable and resentful.
Okay,

1576
01:18:14,781 --> 01:18:15,614
let's call that a baseline and that's 
how you're going to negotiate with your 

1577
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:18,830
wife or your husband.

1578
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,113
That's a good thing to know.
You want to negotiate so that you don't 

1579
01:18:22,851 --> 01:18:23,684
walk away miserable and resentful 
because that makes you hostile and then 

1580
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:28,033
you'll work to hurt them and I would say
that's unless you want to hurt them and 

1581
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:34,190
then of course they'll happily return 
the favor unless you.

1582
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:35,083
If you want to exist in a place where 
you're basically hitting each other in 

1583
01:18:37,611 --> 01:18:39,890
the head repeatedly for 30 years,
you go right ahead,

1584
01:18:39,891 --> 01:18:42,710
but I wouldn't say that that's a 
particularly good way of living.

1585
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:43,850
So you might say,
well,

1586
01:18:43,851 --> 01:18:47,630
the minimal precondition for a 
successful negotiation is that you don't

1587
01:18:47,631 --> 01:18:51,770
walk away resentful and angry.
And so that's also how you know when you

1588
01:18:51,771 --> 01:18:55,190
have something to say to someone because
the rule has to be.

1589
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:57,470
If you're going to walk away resentful 
and angry,

1590
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,170
you've got something to say.
it doesn't mean you're right,

1591
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,690
by the way,
but it does mean that you have something

1592
01:19:02,691 --> 01:19:05,150
to say,
but it's kind of a low bar.

1593
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,000
You know,
like if I wanted to live with you for 30

1594
01:19:08,001 --> 01:19:09,050
years,
maybe we should say,

1595
01:19:09,051 --> 01:19:11,780
how about we walk away from our mutual 
negotiations?

1596
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,350
Thrilled.
Well why not?

1597
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:16,763
You know,
you got to aim for something you could 

1598
01:19:18,141 --> 01:19:21,600
aim for that you want to negotiate with 
your boss for a new seller.

1599
01:19:21,601 --> 01:19:22,460
You might think,
okay,

1600
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:25,610
I've got this damn job.
How much would I have to be paid,

1601
01:19:25,611 --> 01:19:27,350
so I'd be so bloody excited to go to 
work.

1602
01:19:27,351 --> 01:19:31,670
I could hardly stand it while you can at
least know what that number is,

1603
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,040
and then you could go there and say,
well look,

1604
01:19:34,041 --> 01:19:36,260
you know,
you like to have me around.

1605
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:37,303
I've been doing some thinking.
I think if you paid me this amount of 

1606
01:19:39,501 --> 01:19:40,334
money,
I'd be so thrilled to go to work that 

1607
01:19:41,451 --> 01:19:43,130
you could hardly even keep me away from 
here.

1608
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:44,750
And your boss might think,
wow,

1609
01:19:44,751 --> 01:19:45,584
I actually really liked to have someone 
around who would be so thrilled to work 

1610
01:19:47,271 --> 01:19:48,410
that I can't get rid of them.

1611
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:49,730
It's like,
maybe all,

1612
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:51,360
well,
I can't give you all of that.

1613
01:19:51,361 --> 01:19:54,560
I'll give you 75 percent.
Maybe we can renegotiate it in a year,

1614
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:56,000
so like,
hey,

1615
01:19:56,030 --> 01:20:00,800
good deal,
or you can be some weasley coward and go

1616
01:20:00,801 --> 01:20:04,430
in there and snuggle about how awful 
your life is and walk away,

1617
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:07,010
barely able to tolerate the outcome of 
the.

1618
01:20:08,150 --> 01:20:08,983
So like I wouldn't recommend that and 
it's funny because I've watched people 

1619
01:20:12,571 --> 01:20:15,900
do this repeatedly in my clinical 
practice because I do,

1620
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:19,350
we do.
We plan all the time because the rule is

1621
01:20:19,370 --> 01:20:20,203
you're going to come and see me.
I'm going to try to help you figure out 

1622
01:20:21,961 --> 01:20:24,810
how to have the life that you want to 
have and we're going to think about that

1623
01:20:24,811 --> 01:20:25,644
strategically.
So you're making $50,000 a year right 

1624
01:20:27,691 --> 01:20:28,524
now.
Maybe you should be making $150,000 in 

1625
01:20:31,381 --> 01:20:32,940
three years.
And they think,

1626
01:20:32,941 --> 01:20:34,170
well that couldn't happen.

1627
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:37,950
It's like not with that attitude.
That's the first thing.

1628
01:20:37,951 --> 01:20:38,580
It's like,
no,

1629
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:39,413
that's not going to happen if you,
if you don't ask people for the damn 

1630
01:20:42,391 --> 01:20:44,130
money,
if you don't look for a better job,

1631
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:47,340
but they're going to come along and just
shovel a boat full of money at you.

1632
01:20:47,341 --> 01:20:47,881
It's like,
no,

1633
01:20:47,881 --> 01:20:52,170
that's not going to happen,
but why is that impossible?

1634
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:55,170
Look at you people in here.
It's like,

1635
01:20:55,171 --> 01:20:57,000
what the hell is wrong with you?
Nothing.

1636
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:01,050
So you probably have what you want.
If you could figure out whAt the hell it

1637
01:21:01,051 --> 01:21:03,990
was and then you know,
you diligently pursued it.

1638
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:05,243
So.
and then maybe you wouldn't whIne about 

1639
01:21:06,391 --> 01:21:07,224
being alive.
That'd be good because people who whine 

1640
01:21:08,971 --> 01:21:11,910
about being alive or dangerous to 
themselves and other people.

1641
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:13,950
So you might think I can have what I 
want,

1642
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:15,083
but you better well figure out what it 
is and you can't just wait for the like 

1643
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,133
have what you want fairy to show up at 
your doorstep and granted because 

1644
01:21:21,691 --> 01:21:23,280
obviously that's not going to happen.

1645
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:25,290
So.
So.

1646
01:21:25,291 --> 01:21:26,700
Okay.
Conscientiousness,

1647
01:21:26,701 --> 01:21:29,310
while we talked about how you could 
improve that social networking,

1648
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:30,383
that's another big deal.
It's one of the advantages that older 

1649
01:21:31,921 --> 01:21:35,190
people have over younger people.
And so for example,

1650
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:37,230
now that I'm in my fifties,
roughly speaking,

1651
01:21:37,231 --> 01:21:38,064
I know a bunch of other people who are 
relatively well positioned in the 

1652
01:21:40,681 --> 01:21:43,560
dominance hierarchy and they know all 
sorts of people.

1653
01:21:43,950 --> 01:21:47,910
And so when I go to one of them and say,
can you do x or do you know x?

1654
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:50,010
They say no,
but I know someone who can.

1655
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,113
And that's a huge advantage.
So another thing that you want to think 

1656
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:55,380
about as you move through life and this 
is,

1657
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:59,250
is that use your ability to network 
properly.

1658
01:21:59,251 --> 01:22:02,310
And that doesn't mean schmooze and it 
doesn't mean go out and impress people.

1659
01:22:02,311 --> 01:22:05,190
That's all just complete bloody rubbish.
It means you,

1660
01:22:05,191 --> 01:22:07,500
you,
you try to surround yourself with people

1661
01:22:07,501 --> 01:22:08,334
who are competent in multiple different 
dimensions and you maintain your 

1662
01:22:11,071 --> 01:22:11,970
relationships with them.

1663
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:13,660
And that's a trading relationship to 
right.

1664
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:17,550
It involves from reciprocity,
but it's a huge advantage.

1665
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:18,593
A social network is a huge advantage and
that's something extroverted people can 

1666
01:22:21,181 --> 01:22:22,014
be really good at because you know they 
have that sort of social ability and 

1667
01:22:25,261 --> 01:22:26,880
that goes along with the ability to 
sell.

1668
01:22:26,881 --> 01:22:30,900
So another place that you can pick up 
power and power for the good,

1669
01:22:30,901 --> 01:22:31,734
for the right things is to,
is to consciously develop and maintain 

1670
01:22:37,051 --> 01:22:39,450
your social networks.
And that also means,

1671
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:40,733
while,
let's talk about friendships for a 

1672
01:22:41,581 --> 01:22:43,230
minute,
here's how you know,

1673
01:22:43,231 --> 01:22:48,000
if someone's,
your friend a you can tell them bad news

1674
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:49,493
and they'll listen.
They won't tell you why you know you're 

1675
01:22:51,571 --> 01:22:52,404
stupid and why that bad thing happened 
to you and how something worse happened 

1676
01:22:55,041 --> 01:22:57,930
to them once and you know,
derailed the whole conversation.

1677
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:01,200
You can actually tell them bad news and 
they'll listen.

1678
01:23:01,650 --> 01:23:04,200
So that's a good thing.
And then this is a weirder thing.

1679
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:09,040
You can tell them good news
and they'll help you celebrate.

1680
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,490
And that's a really good way of deciding
who you should have around you.

1681
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:15,700
Because if you have someone around you,
you know some good habits you and you're

1682
01:23:15,701 --> 01:23:18,220
kind of afraid to even admit it because 
you know god,

1683
01:23:18,221 --> 01:23:19,054
something good happened to you.
It's like you let that be known and it 

1684
01:23:21,271 --> 01:23:23,290
will certainly be taken away.
So you know,

1685
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:24,124
you come out and you sort of tell 
someone halfheartedly that something 

1686
01:23:26,621 --> 01:23:27,454
good happened to you,
they give you a whack and then talk 

1687
01:23:29,141 --> 01:23:30,130
about,
you know,

1688
01:23:30,150 --> 01:23:33,220
so the great thing that happened to them
three years ago or worse,

1689
01:23:33,221 --> 01:23:36,250
the great thing that happened to someone
that they knew three years ago,

1690
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:39,130
you know,
it's like go away from that person.

1691
01:23:39,131 --> 01:23:42,520
They're not helpful to you and they're 
not helpful to themselves either.

1692
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:45,280
And so you want to surround years,
you've got to think about this.

1693
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:46,423
You've got to surround yourself with 
people who want the best for the best 

1694
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:50,404
part of you.
You can hang around with weasels and 

1695
01:23:52,421 --> 01:23:53,254
losers that are trying to pull you down 
to justify the fact that they're 

1696
01:23:55,631 --> 01:23:57,610
spiraling downhill as well.
And you know,

1697
01:23:57,611 --> 01:24:00,580
the upside of that is you don't have to 
have any responsibility,

1698
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:02,800
can whine about how wretched life is,
you know,

1699
01:24:02,801 --> 01:24:03,634
so that's pretty attractive.
But I would say it's also a bad medium 

1700
01:24:06,551 --> 01:24:08,680
to longterm plan.
And so it's,

1701
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:09,693
it's acceptable and desirable to try to 
surround yourself with people who were 

1702
01:24:15,491 --> 01:24:18,370
facilitating your development.
You know when you might say,

1703
01:24:18,371 --> 01:24:19,620
well,
I've got people around,

1704
01:24:19,630 --> 01:24:21,160
I know them well,
you know they're,

1705
01:24:21,180 --> 01:24:22,013
they're,
they're not doing that well and they're 

1706
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:26,230
and they don't fit into that category.
It's like,

1707
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:29,373
what's your point?

1708
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:31,390
What are you going to do with them?
Exactly.

1709
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:33,940
If they'll,
if they'll listen and cooperate with you

1710
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:36,550
and move towards a better future,
great.

1711
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:40,210
if they don't pay any attention and they
keep doing the same damn things over and

1712
01:24:40,211 --> 01:24:42,430
over and they're not going anywhere and 
is painful,

1713
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,950
then maybe the proper thing to do is 
say,

1714
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:45,993
you just have your misery.
I'll go off and have my life and maybe 

1715
01:24:49,241 --> 01:24:50,074
you'll wake up at some point in the 
future and think that's a better way of 

1716
01:24:52,361 --> 01:24:56,230
being because just putting up with it is
while they call that enabling,

1717
01:24:56,231 --> 01:24:58,690
right?
You put up with that sort of behavior.

1718
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:03,010
You're providing tacit consent for it 
and even tacit approval.

1719
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:05,650
It's like bad idea.
You have,

1720
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:10,240
I would say both the right and the 
responsibility to surround yourself with

1721
01:25:10,241 --> 01:25:14,980
people who are good for the best part of
you and that's not the same as you know.

1722
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:19,300
Don't have to elaborate on that.
You can figure out what that means.

1723
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,700
Skills,
that's another thing you can do,

1724
01:25:21,701 --> 01:25:22,534
and if you want to increase your 
probability of success every time you 

1725
01:25:25,211 --> 01:25:26,044
have an opportunity to take an 
opportunity that would provide you with 

1726
01:25:29,170 --> 01:25:31,300
a new skill.
Do it right.

1727
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,040
Learn to program,
learn to write,

1728
01:25:33,041 --> 01:25:34,570
learn to read,
read new things,

1729
01:25:34,571 --> 01:25:35,404
learn to public speak.
Learn how to introduce yourSelf to 

1730
01:25:37,241 --> 01:25:38,890
people.
Learn how to socIal network,

1731
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:41,910
learn how to go talk to your boss in a 
matter.

1732
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,950
This is the right way to go.
Talk to someone who's supervising you.

1733
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:46,893
I see this problem and here's the 
solution and so I'm coming to talk to 

1734
01:25:50,201 --> 01:25:51,034
you about the problem and the solution.
It's like that person is going to want 

1735
01:25:53,741 --> 01:25:57,050
to talk to you a lot because the other 
people they're talking to,

1736
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:59,170
you are going to come and say,
I've got a problem.

1737
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:00,603
Can you do something about it?
Like they don't want to do something 

1738
01:26:02,141 --> 01:26:04,010
about it.
They already got things to do.

1739
01:26:04,011 --> 01:26:04,844
You know?
So if you're the person who constantly 

1740
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:09,530
brings forth a problem,
even if they're accurate problems,

1741
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:10,364
is why are they going?
They're going to want to have you 

1742
01:26:11,421 --> 01:26:13,160
around.
It's you're just,

1743
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,593
you're just another problem.
Don't be a problem for the people who 

1744
01:26:17,241 --> 01:26:19,850
want to give you money.
That's a good rule of thumb,

1745
01:26:19,851 --> 01:26:21,020
man.
You know,

1746
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:24,590
if someone wants to give you money,
then help them do that.

1747
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:26,780
And if they want to give you status and 
success,

1748
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:28,280
then help them do that.
right?

1749
01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:29,323
And you do that in part by bringing them
solutions and partly you do that by 

1750
01:26:31,881 --> 01:26:32,714
developing your skills.
And so if things aren't going very well 

1751
01:26:35,001 --> 01:26:37,430
for you,
this is also a good way of evaluating an

1752
01:26:37,431 --> 01:26:39,980
opportunity.
Should you take an opportunity.

1753
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:41,390
Well,
here's the rule,

1754
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:46,370
take the opportunity if it will teach 
you something that you can use for other

1755
01:26:46,371 --> 01:26:48,530
opportunities because then even if it 
fails,

1756
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:50,343
which it probably will,
doesn't matter because you've accrued 

1757
01:26:52,821 --> 01:26:56,750
something of value that you can bring 
forward to the next situation.

1758
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:57,613
So you know,
there's this old union idea that I told 

1759
01:26:59,511 --> 01:27:02,600
you about the sharp cathedral,
for example,

1760
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:07,490
the cathedral is made in the form of a 
cross and the cross signifies the center

1761
01:27:07,491 --> 01:27:08,324
of the world and the dome signifies the 
sky and so right below the dome at the 

1762
01:27:12,141 --> 01:27:12,974
center of the world,
and it's a cross because the cross is 

1763
01:27:15,141 --> 01:27:15,974
the place of suffering.
So that's the center of the world 

1764
01:27:17,450 --> 01:27:19,760
because that's what you are,
you're the place of suffering,

1765
01:27:19,761 --> 01:27:21,410
right?
You're the place of conscious suffering.

1766
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:22,303
That's the center Of the world.
And so inscribed on the floor is a maze 

1767
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:29,540
and you and it's a big maze and it's a 
mandela and,

1768
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:34,310
and there's a kind of a flower shaped 
resting place right in the center.

1769
01:27:34,610 --> 01:27:38,870
And what you're doing is walking in the 
maze and you walk all four quadrants and

1770
01:27:38,871 --> 01:27:41,000
you get to the middle,
which is where you want to be.

1771
01:27:41,050 --> 01:27:42,790
You want to be in the middle.
Well,

1772
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:43,633
how do you get there?
You walk everywhere aNd what does that 

1773
01:27:45,621 --> 01:27:46,454
mean?
It means every bloody time you're 

1774
01:27:47,421 --> 01:27:52,400
offered an opportunity,
take it and develop your skills.

1775
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:55,490
And that's better than wealth by the 
way,

1776
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:56,383
in fact,
it actually constitutes wealth because 

1777
01:27:57,561 --> 01:28:00,770
wealth constitutes what you have when 
someone takes all your money away,

1778
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,990
right?
That's real wealth.

1779
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:06,230
And so the way that you build up that 
sort of wealth is you turn yourself into

1780
01:28:06,231 --> 01:28:10,640
someone who's competent in multiple 
directions and you can be doing that all

1781
01:28:10,641 --> 01:28:11,600
the time,
right?

1782
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:14,630
Especially with the kind of technology 
that you people have access to.

1783
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:16,970
I mean,
you can learn anything you want whenever

1784
01:28:16,971 --> 01:28:18,980
you want.
So what a good deal that is,

1785
01:28:18,981 --> 01:28:20,870
man.
And so there's,

1786
01:28:20,930 --> 01:28:21,763
there's easy fruit hanging that you 
could pick and I would recommend that 

1787
01:28:24,291 --> 01:28:25,124
you do that.
