1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,150
Hello?
Uh,

2
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:02,980
my name is Boris Chamber and we produce,
uh,

3
00:00:02,981 --> 00:00:03,880
with,
uh,

4
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,620
the agenda at Tvo.
And I'm speaking with Jordan Peterson.

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,060
I'm a clinical psychologist and 
professor of psychology at University of

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,033
Toronto and the security duration of our
conversation that we started a month 

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:19,600
ago,
uh,

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,780
about his new project.
But your honesty project,

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,500
I called 42.
So reminders,

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,630
uh,
it,

11
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:28,300
Justin,
what the book is about.

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,350
Well,
the book,

13
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,930
I wrote a little article for an online 
site.

14
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,510
He responds to questions about rules to 
live by,

15
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,463
and the site's called Cora.
And you could post any question or any 

16
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:44,874
answer on Cora.
And so for awhile I was kind of 

17
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:49,950
interested in answering core questions 
and I answered that one.

18
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:53,670
I came up with a list of 42 rules,
which is probably more than he bargained

19
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:54,504
for,
but the list became my core standards 

20
00:00:57,421 --> 00:00:59,580
quite popular.
So,

21
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,073
um,
I talked to an agent book agent that I 

22
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,373
have been working with in Vancouver 
about the possibility of working it up 

23
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:10,290
into a book.
And so that's,

24
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,600
that's the origin story of this 
particular project.

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,250
So last time we talked about about,
uh,

26
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,500
uh,
those items on your list would seem less

27
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:22,334
than absolutely serious that to do with 
the reasons for why it is that we need 

28
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,540
to make one of our rules,
uh,

29
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:30,740
beautiful.
Uh,

30
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:31,574
they had to do with skateboarders and 
the respect they deserve and I such 

31
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:36,794
items.
And today I would like to switch the 

32
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,020
gears a bit and,
uh,

33
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,470
talk about perhaps the one item on your 
list,

34
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:46,440
uh,
which,

35
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,303
uh,
which betrays a hint of a theme that 

36
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,580
seems to be missing in the book,
which is the theme is death.

37
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,080
And the last item on your list,
the item number 42,

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,650
is be grateful in spite of your 
suffering,

39
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,173
uh,
how much of that suffering that you are 

40
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:07,460
referring to has to do with the,
uh,

41
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,810
inevitability of death.

42
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,860
It's broader than that.
I think in some ways.

43
00:02:12,861 --> 00:02:13,231
I mean,
there's,

44
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:17,690
if there's a large psychological 
literature on the human terror of death,

45
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:18,843
but I think that the people who think 
that human beings are afraid of death 

46
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,973
are,
are,

47
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,830
are far too optimistic.
Okay.

48
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,033
We're afraid of a lot more than death.
We're afraid of degeneration and 

49
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:36,021
deterioration and pain and betrayal and 
insanity and death.

50
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,073
And you know,
you could say that death is the most 

51
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:42,384
frightening of those,
but it isn't because otherwise people 

52
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:45,030
wouldn't commit suicide.

53
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:46,843
Not to the extent that that has 
universal as opposed to the other items 

54
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:51,680
that you have mentioned.
Uh,

55
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,830
it doesn't,
uh,

56
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:56,980
that fair represents a kind of a 
extension of frame that a,

57
00:02:56,981 --> 00:02:58,780
that involves all of us.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,681
Well,
I think it's,

59
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:00,514
I think the frame is better 
conceptualized as vulnerability with 

60
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:06,760
death being a sub element of that.
You know,

61
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:10,150
and I'm not trying to make light of the 
universality of death obviously,

62
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,223
but,
but it's a broader category of problem 

63
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,610
and when you're trying to address a 
problem that that's,

64
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,503
that's that serious,
it's very important to get the 

65
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:21,430
terminology perfectly straight.
You know what I mean?

66
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,910
People's relationship with death is 
rather ambivalent because I'm mean,

67
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:27,903
there are any number of documented and 
continue in cases of people putting 

68
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:33,250
their lives on the line for things they 
believe in.

69
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,241
So,
you know,

70
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:35,074
you could also make the case that the 
absence of meaning is a more terrifying 

71
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,930
prospect than the possibility of death.
So,

72
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:44,764
but regardless of old out there,
there's still something fundamental at 

73
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:50,500
the bottom of this,
which is addressed by that particular,

74
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,910
um,
rule,

75
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:54,760
which is to be grateful in spite of your
suffering.

76
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,593
And the rule there is that the fact that
people bump up against their own 

77
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,813
limitations and their own 
vulnerabilities means that life is 

78
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:05,410
characterized in an,
in a way that's,

79
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,150
it's not fundamentally addressable or 
removable by suffering.

80
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,130
And that's Buddhists dictate,
right?

81
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:14,440
The Great Buddhist dictate is that life 
is suffering.

82
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,053
But,
and people think of that as a 

83
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:20,830
pessimistic claim.
And in one way it is.

84
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:22,360
But,
but I should point out too,

85
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:26,440
that that claim isn't limited among 
religious thinkers to Buddhists.

86
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,390
I mean the,
the,

87
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,380
the primary symbol of Christianity is a 
crucified person.

88
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,240
The relationship between that suffering 
seems fairly self evident,

89
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:38,074
especially when you also consider the 
drama of the crucifixion was also 

90
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:46,090
accompanied by betrayal and,
and torture before death.

91
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,953
You know?
So it's kind of like the ultimate in 

92
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,810
catastrophic stories.
And of course,

93
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:54,811
Judaism concentrates to a large degree 
on a history of suffering and the way,

94
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,340
the manner in which that might be 
addressed.

95
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,630
So with regards to being grateful,
well,

96
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:02,291
you might say,
well,

97
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,124
how can you be grateful as if your life 
is characterized by the necessity of 

98
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:07,870
suffering?
Well,

99
00:05:07,871 --> 00:05:10,260
that needs to be stepped through.
Very thoughtful.

100
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,980
So the first thing is,
why are you doomed to suffer?

101
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,113
Like,
why is life set up so that people are 

102
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:18,214
due to suffer?
That's a constant existential complaint 

103
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,330
that sort of echoes through the 
centuries.

104
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:26,920
I mean,
you hear it in different ways.

105
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,960
Why do good things happen to bad people,
I suppose is the most cliched way of,

106
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,113
of formulating the problem.
But there's some deep answers to this 

107
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:37,354
question,
like really deep answers and they're 

108
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:41,020
really helpful.
And so one of them is,

109
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:45,400
and I learned this partly from reading 
Jewish thought on the matter.

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,540
And at the moment,
I can't tell you what the sources were,

111
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,433
but I read two things that were really 
helpful to me when I was trying to sort 

112
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:54,460
this out.

113
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,370
And one was a common buyer,
uh,

114
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,523
uh,
Jewish commentator I think from the 

115
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:01,550
Talmud who said that it was pc.
He made a,

116
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,700
he presented a riddle,
which is kind of like a Zen Koan.

117
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,563
You know,
Zen Koan is like the sound of one hand 

118
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:11,870
clapping just that actually this,
so it's,

119
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,580
you know,
it's not that mysterious,

120
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:18,020
but the question was it was about the 
nature of God.

121
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:21,500
And so the question runs,
if God is omniscient,

122
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,190
omnipresent and omnipotent,
which is sort of like the,

123
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,263
the,
the way that totality is being broken 

124
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:35,621
down into its sub elements,
what could he possibly lock and answer?

125
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,460
That is limitation.
And so then there's a,

126
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,683
there's a corollary to that to that is 
also derived from Jewish thought that 

127
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:47,930
runs that man in God or in the sense 
twins,

128
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,190
they're like poles on a continuum and 
god is the infinite end of the continuum

129
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:53,024
and man is the fine idea.
Now the problem with the problem with 

130
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:59,330
being without limitation is that there's
no,

131
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:00,880
okay,

132
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,670
there's no journey,
there's no transformation,

133
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:05,800
there's no change,
there's no progress,

134
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,290
there's no plot,
there's nothing interesting.

135
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,693
There's no differentiation between 
things because everything can be 

136
00:07:11,771 --> 00:07:12,604
anything at any moment.
And so the point of this Jewish line of 

137
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:17,074
thinking is that limitation is a 
blessing because it allows for being 

138
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,140
without limitation.
There's no being.

139
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,250
So that's okay.
So that's a hell of an observation.

140
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:29,020
Without limitation,
there's no big.

141
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,930
So then the next question might be,
well,

142
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,330
if,
if,

143
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:40,170
if being necessitates limitation and 
limitation generates suffering,

144
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:47,080
then maybe being is not something to be 
respected,

145
00:07:47,081 --> 00:07:47,914
are devoutly hoped for.
And that's been examined very carefully 

146
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:51,730
to,
so for example,

147
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:55,810
Mephistopheles the character girth 
girth,

148
00:07:55,811 --> 00:07:59,200
this character in false Mephistopheles 
who's obviously the devil,

149
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,910
his basic credo is that because limited 
being produced as suffering,

150
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:08,020
it should be eradicated because it,
and the same argument is sort of made by

151
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,510
Ivan in the brothers Karamazov he 
basically says,

152
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:11,344
well look,
the world's a corrupt place because 

153
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,820
there's all these limited beings running
around in their suffering like mad.

154
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,340
Maybe it'd be better if the whole thing 
was just done away with.

155
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,710
Well,
unless you think that's a good idea.

156
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,800
And apparently there have been people 
who have,

157
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,820
it seems to be a really bad idea.
But then you might ask,

158
00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:31,840
well,
what's the alternative?

159
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:32,674
And the alternative hypothetically is to
figure out a way of life that's 

160
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,800
intrinsically meaningful enough so that 
the suffering is justified,

161
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,580
not so that it can go away.
And I think that the core,

162
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,080
the purpose of religious thinking and 
the,

163
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:46,914
and the goal towards which it's directed
is to outline a motive being that 

164
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:55,000
justifies the suffering that life 
entails.

165
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,650
And so if you live properly from a 
religious perspective,

166
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:03,651
then the suffering is not so burdensome 
that it warps and,

167
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,840
and corrupts you.
And part of that is to be grateful.

168
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,750
Could have been,
as I say,

169
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:18,751
that the purpose of religious thought as
to reconcile us to the fact of that.

170
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,753
Well,

171
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:22,803
yes,
religious thought is often criticized 

172
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:27,690
thoughtlessly for that.
So for example,

173
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:28,524
this kind of started most mostly with 
the Marxist send the Floridians back at 

174
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:33,960
the end of the 19th century.
So,

175
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:34,794
you know,
Freud believed that religion was a 

176
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,630
defense against death,
death,

177
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:40,464
anxiety.
He thought about it as an infant title 

178
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:42,504
defense.
You know that people were afraid of 

179
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:48,150
death and because of that they stayed 
infantiles and regarded,

180
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,253
you know,
generated a delusional hypothesis about 

181
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:52,794
the world being analogous to something 
being taken care of by an all knowing 

182
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:57,474
and all loving father who was going to 
pay us back for all the terrible 

183
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:01,584
limitations of suffering.
Being Freud thought about that is very 

184
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:06,900
instant title.
And then at the same time,

185
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:07,734
Marx thought of religion from a 
defensive perspective as the opiate of 

186
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:13,950
the masses,
right?

187
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:14,784
Is that religion was something that the 
powers that be promoted because it in 

188
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:19,824
Europe,
people to the suffering that was a 

189
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:21,444
necessary consequence.
Well for marks at least of capitalist 

190
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:25,020
development.
And you know,

191
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:28,830
those critiques were extremely powerful.
They dominated 20th century thought,

192
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,170
but they're,
they're fairly shallow.

193
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,413
Yeah.
But they are by their reasons why they 

194
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:34,450
were accepted.
I mean,

195
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,680
it's hard because they're half true.

196
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,160
Well,
no by,

197
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,010
but I would say it's more than that.
I mean,

198
00:10:42,011 --> 00:10:43,630
I think,
I think that they,

199
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:44,464
uh,
uh,

200
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,990
obviously,
uh,

201
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,290
meant to offer people a sense of,
uh,

202
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,643
of,
uh,

203
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,873
of their own life somehow.
The idea of individualism and then 

204
00:10:57,431 --> 00:11:00,940
social mastery of,
of human affairs,

205
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,380
uh,
was to when there has independent of the

206
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:06,800
shackles of,
of uh,

207
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,930
religious,
uh,

208
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,970
uh,
dependents.

209
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,180
Yeah.
That worked really well.

210
00:11:11,181 --> 00:11:14,650
We ran from the shackles dependence into
the shackles of video,

211
00:11:14,651 --> 00:11:16,070
logical dependents.
No,

212
00:11:16,071 --> 00:11:16,671
I,
I'm,

213
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:19,250
I'm with you on that.
But still,

214
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,170
when ideas take as widely and as deeply 
as atheism has,

215
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,670
it means since pills at role,
it's not a false idea.

216
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,863
Oh yeah.
It's not like this was a trivial 

217
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:35,240
conflict and I'm not trying to 
trivialize either fried your marks.

218
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,280
Like I think Marx was fundamentally 
corrupt,

219
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:38,114
but I don't think that if Freud,
I think the Freudian criticism is an 

220
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:43,080
extremely deep one,
but it's,

221
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:46,610
it's,
it is basically half true.

222
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:47,444
I mean,
one of the things that Charles Taylor 

223
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:49,520
pointed out,
Taylor zone,

224
00:11:49,521 --> 00:11:51,440
philosopher Miguel and he wrote a book 
called,

225
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:53,210
I think it was called the sources of the
self.

226
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,410
What?
I mean,

227
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:58,660
he took Freud's argument depart and he 
said,

228
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:00,160
well,
that's all well and good.

229
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,180
If you,
you know,

230
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:04,150
you can think of religious belief as a 
naive,

231
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,850
optimistic defense against death 
anxiety,

232
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,684
let's say,
except that the facts don't bear that 

233
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:11,440
out.
Because in Christianity,

234
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:12,430
for example,
in the middle,

235
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,264
the Middle Ages,
and later there are people who are 

236
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:18,790
powerfully terrified of hell.
And I mean,

237
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,700
it's one thing to be afraid of death,
but if you believe in hell,

238
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,440
hell is a lot worse than death.

239
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,240
And so you might say,
well,

240
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,403
if you're going to conjure up a whole 
religion just to make you feel good 

241
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:29,104
about the fact that you know,
to help you deal with the fact that 

242
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:32,764
you're going to die,
why bother conjuring up a hell that you 

243
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:39,580
can suffer in forever if you make even 
the slightest moral error.

244
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:40,571
And then,
you know,

245
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:44,290
that waits for you in infinitely.
And you know,

246
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,300
you'd have to be really cynical to say,
well,

247
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:50,740
you have to put something sour in the 
medicine to make it believable.

248
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,450
It's like,
it's not like that at all.

249
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:57,340
But the develop medieval Christians were
terrified of hell.

250
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:59,590
Like modern people are terrified of 
meaninglessness.

251
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:00,424
So you can't put at religions feet the 
proposition of some simplistic antidote 

252
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,463
to the fear of death.
That's I know what Freud why for I did 

253
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:11,314
that and I think that religious belief 
like any beliefs can be used in an 

254
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:18,160
infant title manner,
but as a deep criticism of religion,

255
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,150
it's lacking and that's partly why you 
own in Freud eventually parted ways,

256
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,493
you know,
because you'll notice that there was 

257
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:28,600
more to religion than defense and that 
that has to do with this suffering issue

258
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,493
because,
because the antidote to suffering has 

259
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:34,264
meaning.

260
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,313
Now some of that meaning can be 
encapsulated in religious belief and 

261
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:40,120
that's sort of like the traditional 
guide to meaning,

262
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:46,110
but if meaning is pursued properly,
then people don't get corrupted by their

263
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:49,900
suffering and that actually diminishes 
the net total of suffering,

264
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,450
which is a really big,
that's a really big gain.

265
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:54,610
If you think suffering is the basic 
problem,

266
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,500
you certainly don't want to approach it 
in a way that makes it worse.

267
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:00,540
Like it's,
it's,

268
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,120
it's,
it's,

269
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,030
that's not an acceptable philosophical 
argument.

270
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,090
If something's bad and you and you 
believe it's bad,

271
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,830
you are not allowed to use an antidote 
that makes that thing works.

272
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,510
If,
if you're going to play that game,

273
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:14,344
then people have to stop talking to you 
because you're violating the principle 

274
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:21,070
of noncontradiction and that's the basic
principle for community.

275
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,760
Without that principle,
communication cannot take place.

276
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,380
So you,
if you play that game,

277
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:28,120
you have to complete that by yourself in
a corner.

278
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,790
You can't actually have a discussion 
with anybody if you've been to play that

279
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,624
game.
Now the gratitude issue is deeper too 

280
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:35,980
because one of the things that's pointed
out,

281
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:36,814
for example in genesis in the second 
chapter of Genesis or the second story 

282
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:43,084
of Genesis,
that's the story of Cain and Abel 

283
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,840
Caine's big problem is that he's not 
grateful.

284
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:50,080
He's really resentful and Cain enabler 
in some ways.

285
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:50,914
The first two people and Keynes,
a good guy and sort of like the model 

286
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:57,500
for good guys and Cain is a bad guy and 
he's the model for bad guys.

287
00:14:57,501 --> 00:15:01,700
They're sort of like Christ and Satan in
their nascent forms and keynes.

288
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:05,360
Big problem is that he's resentful and 
it really doesn't work out well.

289
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,253
That makes him the first murderer.
It also makes him the ancestor of the 

290
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:14,780
first person who makes tools of war.
And so the in gratitude be characterized

291
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,040
as Kane.
I mean cane basically shakes his fist at

292
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:17,890
God and says,
you know,

293
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,983
what sort of

294
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,380
is there for a reason.
It's not meaning an accidental,

295
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,260
that appearance.
I mean,

296
00:15:25,261 --> 00:15:26,094
Cain and Abel are what they are because 
they intended to provide us with 

297
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,480
bookends of human possibilities.

298
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,933
Like cain.
Cain makes the strongest possible 

299
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:39,280
rational argument for the 
meaninglessness of life.

300
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,270
He's just like Ivan in the brothers 
Karamazov like,

301
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,133
and one of the really,
one of the things that's really 

302
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,503
deceitful,
deceitful about rationality is that 

303
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,840
rationality also claims that it can be 
used to justify lights and it can't,

304
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:00,780
rationality can be used to take life 
apart and to demolish its meaning,

305
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:01,614
but it can't be used to.
It can't be used as an antidote against 

306
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:04,764
meaninglessness.

307
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,560
It's too narrow a conduit.
And Jordan,

308
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,500
what's your thinking on the queer by,
by the question of whether on uh,

309
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,720
we are today more or less afraid of that
than we used to have been,

310
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,440
let's say 20 years ago.
Any thoughts on this?

311
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:23,274
Objects?

312
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,840
I think that we are in some ways and 
we're not in some ways,

313
00:16:27,841 --> 00:16:28,674
so we are in some ways because we don't 
really have to deal with it like people 

314
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,133
once did.
And I think that a good thing or bad 

315
00:16:39,061 --> 00:16:39,450
thing,
no,

316
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,283
I don't think it's a good thing at all.
I think it keeps us permanently 

317
00:16:41,911 --> 00:16:44,740
immature.
I think it's a bad thing.

318
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,783
I mean all of,
all of the material that I've read that 

319
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:48,954
deals with such issues in a deep way 
suggests that the way that you overcome 

320
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:56,320
your fear of something is by voluntarily
confronting it,

321
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,840
not by running away from it.
And I give you an example.

322
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,840
I had a client once who was terrified of
death.

323
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,380
And when I say terrifying to death,
I mean terrified of death.

324
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,543
This woman tried to force herself into 
unconsciousness using various 

325
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:17,161
pharmacological means for like 20 hours 
a day for 10 years because she,

326
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,350
she thought life was so unbearable that 
she didn't even want to be awake for it.

327
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:25,740
And she was a vegetarian because partly 
because she couldn't,

328
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,850
she couldn't even tolerate walking into 
a butcher store like,

329
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,050
so she,
she was,

330
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,880
she was too terrified.
And I mean,

331
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:35,400
I took her to a bunch of store at one 
point and watched her,

332
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:36,234
I mean,
which is a,

333
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,393
it's a classic approach in psychotherapy
to have people come to confront the 

334
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:40,584
things they're afraid of,
but she was so terrified of death that 

335
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,023
it made it impossible for her to live.
Now what happened with her eventually 

336
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,770
guided by her dreams because her dream 
suggested what to do.

337
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,830
I took her to a embalming human and 
momming,

338
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,683
you know,
uh,

339
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:02,610
a great reburial preparation and well 
the first thing that happened was,

340
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,790
although she was absolutely terrified to
go there and didn't think that she would

341
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,624
be able to angle it and like it's not a 
trivial thing cause we were only about 

342
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,303
eight feet away from the embalming and 
it was just her and me and the person 

343
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:15,930
who was doing me and mommy and I mean 
it's a pretty,

344
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,840
it's not one of,
it's a,

345
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:21,600
it's a pretty visceral experience,
let's put it that way.

346
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:22,883
And you know,
she looked away a lot during the 

347
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:27,840
procedure for the first 15 minutes or 
so,

348
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,280
but,
but she didn't leave.

349
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:30,114
Then after 15 minutes or so,
she was able to focus on the procedure 

350
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:33,924
pretty closely.
And at one point she was even able to 

351
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,360
lay your hand on the body.
I mean she had a glove on and it was all

352
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:40,194
very carefully done and that was really 
useful to her cause it kind of 

353
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:44,444
calibrated her in some way.
It taught her the difference between 

354
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,490
what there is to be afraid of.
That's real.

355
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,563
And all the shades and nightmares that 
people encounter that are just in some 

356
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:57,000
ways there,
you know,

357
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,910
demonic or pathological figments of 
their imagination.

358
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,023
It was also very useful to me because I 
haven't done a lot of looking at a 

359
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:06,810
human.
The caucus,

360
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,310
well,
I'm very squeamish.

361
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,160
I wouldn't say that I'm actually very 
sensitive to discussed.

362
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,780
It's a biological proclivity and so this
is part of me.

363
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,480
I could have never been a surgeon than I
would.

364
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,720
I would have a very difficult time 
dealing with people,

365
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,200
people's physiological trouble,
you know,

366
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:26,520
I don't have the stomach for it,
but it was really useful for me to go to

367
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:29,760
the funeral home.
Not so much because I viewed the moment,

368
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,163
but because it gave me a chance to talk 
through the processes that are 

369
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:36,294
associated with depth,
with someone who deals with it on a 

370
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:39,210
regular basis.
You know,

371
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,340
if human beings,
primary fear was death,

372
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:44,100
there wouldn't be any funeral home 
operators.

373
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,993
How the hell could they manage it?
Well when I talked to the guys about 

374
00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:48,421
that too,
you know,

375
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,254
and about how they,
what sort of effect dealing with death 

376
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:54,900
on a nonstop basis had on their lives 
and how they viewed the role.

377
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,733
And you know,
they view their role in some ways as 

378
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,500
shepherds,
right?

379
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:02,340
They were shepherding people through the
process of death,

380
00:20:02,341 --> 00:20:06,360
which throws everything up in the air.
And they were there to ritualize it in a

381
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:07,194
way,
and they took that responsibility 

382
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:09,504
seriously.
But it was also useful to me to figure 

383
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:15,750
out exactly what the practical steps 
were involved in dealing with death.

384
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:20,310
Because at some point you're going to 
have that responsibility.

385
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:23,850
Someone close to you is going to die.
And at that point you're either going to

386
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:25,470
run around,
you know,

387
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,830
in a complete neurotic fit and be more 
trouble than you're worth.

388
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:31,830
Are you going to step up to the plate 
and be helpful and um,

389
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,873
you know,
and be strong and help the people who 

390
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:39,420
have to deal with that catastrophe,
do it in a straightforward manner.

391
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,613
And that's a,
that's a responsibility that people 

392
00:20:42,151 --> 00:20:44,970
have.
And to be a complete human being,

393
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:45,804
you have to be strong enough to do that 
and you're not going to be that way if 

394
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:48,904
you run away from it.
The thing about people is they're 

395
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,610
stronger than the fear of death.
Death is terrible,

396
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:55,930
but we're stronger than that.

397
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,100
You had the reason to think about is 
some,

398
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:00,934
some weeks or months ago we had a bit of
health problem and you didn't know what 

399
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,770
it was or you thought that was worse 
than it actually was.

400
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:09,604
And,
and you told me that you were thinking 

401
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:12,040
about possibility of dying.

402
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,450
Yeah,
well I hadn't,

403
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:18,510
I had a lung shadow on a,
on an x ray and which I thought was,

404
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,570
you know,
radiological error or something similar.

405
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,770
But then for unrelated reasons,
a month and a half or so later,

406
00:21:26,771 --> 00:21:27,604
yeah,
I started to get short of breath and 

407
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,840
then my energy level's declined 
precipitously and I thought,

408
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,000
Huh,
that's not a great combination.

409
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,490
Lung Shadow plus cancer symptoms,
you know?

410
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:37,683
So

411
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:44,230
some days thinking about that by the 
possibility of,

412
00:21:44,231 --> 00:21:46,520
of much to premature demise,
how,

413
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,620
how,
how would you think,

414
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,720
uh,
what were your thoughts like?

415
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:50,933
Well,
the first thing I should say is that's 

416
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,820
not unfamiliar territory for me.
You know,

417
00:21:53,821 --> 00:21:58,080
I spent like really I spent,
when I was writing my first book,

418
00:21:58,081 --> 00:22:01,050
I spent like a decade thinking about 
death.

419
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,860
And I mean it was really in some ways an
obsession.

420
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:07,260
It was more the book's about me and not 
about death.

421
00:22:07,261 --> 00:22:08,094
But as you already pointed out,
those two things are very tightly 

422
00:22:10,261 --> 00:22:11,190
linked.
I mean,

423
00:22:11,191 --> 00:22:12,480
for,
for months,

424
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,343
years,
even the first thought I had on waking 

425
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:16,960
up was,
uh,

426
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,430
life is short.
You know,

427
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,310
I was very,
very conscious of time passing by and,

428
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:29,120
and potentially time passing by in a 
meaningless and useless manner.

429
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,390
Now why that was the case,
God only knows,

430
00:22:32,391 --> 00:22:33,224
you know,
it's very difficult to understand what 

431
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:38,380
tribes are most spontaneous motivation.
You wouldn't have to go with the federal

432
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:39,740
fee for that,
you know?

433
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,421
Well,
I did,

434
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:41,171
but you know,
it was,

435
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:43,030
I just happened to be conducting the 
therapy.

436
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,840
You can do a lot of therapy by reading 
and by thinking and bike riding.

437
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,460
And I mean,
there's a technical literature on that.

438
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,390
Writing is unbelievably therapeutic.
It makes you healthier

439
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,830
the way you managed to think about the 
possibility of an early death.

440
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,140
Yeah.
Well I mean what was,

441
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,920
there was an element of black humor to 
it I think,

442
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:10,754
which is something that's often,
it's like the source of black humor 

443
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:16,010
really.
Cause there's an absurdity about death,

444
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:16,844
right?
Because within the sort of human domain 

445
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:22,160
of striving through our rules,
which has been,

446
00:23:22,161 --> 00:23:24,050
if you work hard and you do the right 
thing,

447
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,110
then good things happen to you.
It's like a game.

448
00:23:27,111 --> 00:23:29,720
You're playing.
The game has these rules and if you play

449
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:30,554
it properly then you get the benefits.
But death is something that's sort of 

450
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,733
outside the rules of all games and 
whether you've been playing the game 

451
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,380
properly or not,
it doesn't have that much effect on your

452
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:45,830
ultimate vulnerability.
And so there's a,

453
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,870
there's an absurdity about that,
you know,

454
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,620
having come this far to be cut down,
you know,

455
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,790
at 50 cause I'm,
I'm 50 seemed absurd.

456
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:56,923
And so there was that element,
although I'm kind of used to absurdity 

457
00:23:58,941 --> 00:24:00,560
in a way.
So that didn't bother me so much.

458
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:01,394
But what really bothered me,
I think it wasn't so much the 

459
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,570
contemplation of my own disappearance as
what I would miss,

460
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:09,031
you know?
And,

461
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,840
and what the consequences of that would 
also be for my family.

462
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,430
You know,
because when you leave,

463
00:24:13,431 --> 00:24:16,970
you leave a hole and that's unpleasant 
hope.

464
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:22,540
Hopefully it's up and you miss things.
And that's a tragedy.

465
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,830
I mean,
and you know,

466
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,700
so I had to,
I had to sort through that.

467
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,920
I guess it made it more personal.

468
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:36,530
I'm curious about this concern for the 
wellbeing of uh,

469
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,713
uh,
you know,

470
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,730
Tammy,
your wife and your children.

471
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,010
Um,
Eh,

472
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,440
when you,
did you feel that,

473
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,480
that,
were you afraid?

474
00:24:47,481 --> 00:24:47,951
I mean,
we're,

475
00:24:47,951 --> 00:24:50,000
we're terrified of,
of,

476
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,590
uh,
uh,

477
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,640
of losing touch with that,
which is kind of the only true reality,

478
00:24:58,191 --> 00:24:59,300
you know,
because,

479
00:24:59,301 --> 00:25:03,110
uh,
or did you do have an access to thoughts

480
00:25:03,111 --> 00:25:05,390
and feelings about the possibility of an
afterlife?

481
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,940
Okay.
First of all,

482
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,730
we mean the world is a very strange 
place.

483
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,840
And for me,
ignorance,

484
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:22,230
one of the things about humility,
let's say something that's associated to

485
00:25:23,141 --> 00:25:26,960
some degree with gratitude.
Humility is recognition of your,

486
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:27,843
of your ignorance.
And limits and people think that 

487
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:34,950
recognition of your ignorance and limits
is a frightening thing.

488
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:35,784
So they often act in a narcissistic way 
and lay claim to more knowledge than 

489
00:25:39,461 --> 00:25:40,294
they have,
but there comes a point if you think 

490
00:25:42,521 --> 00:25:46,170
things through that the fact that you're
ignorant is a great comfort.

491
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,850
Okay,
okay.

492
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,913
You know,
I mean for me to be properly terrified 

493
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:52,690
and death in the sort of the classic 
way,

494
00:25:52,691 --> 00:25:57,050
I would have to assume that I knew what 
life meant and how,

495
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,893
why and how it is that we're here and 
how our consciousness operates and what 

496
00:26:01,331 --> 00:26:02,164
the relationship is between 
consciousness and material reality and 

497
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,303
how time works and what's the 
relationship between the present and 

498
00:26:09,161 --> 00:26:12,850
infinity and like not only do we not 
understand those things,

499
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,400
we don't understand them at all.

500
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,040
We don't understand consciousness at 
all.

501
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,630
We know,
for example,

502
00:26:19,631 --> 00:26:20,464
the physicists have taught us that 
there's an intake or relationship 

503
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:23,374
between consciousness and the 
manifestation of the transformation of 

504
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,004
possibility into actuality.
Consciousness transforms actuality into 

505
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,493
our potentiality to actuality,
and it does that literally in that 

506
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,680
before something is consciously 
perceived.

507
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,060
It exists as like a set of 
possibilities,

508
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,480
none of which are specified.
And it isn't till consciousness observes

509
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,330
it,
that it snaps into actual being.

510
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,663
This isn't metaphysics,
this is quantum physics and quantum 

511
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:56,094
physics is why we're talking to one 
another and underlies all the 

512
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:00,300
electronics we use.
It underlies everything.

513
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:04,020
And it's the only scientific theory that
we've ever produced but has never made a

514
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:04,854
prediction error.
So it's as right as things get with 

515
00:27:08,281 --> 00:27:10,650
regards to an afterlife.
I mean,

516
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,473
I've had strange experiences that have 
taught me things about the potential 

517
00:27:16,351 --> 00:27:17,184
nature of consciousness and,
and so that makes me unwilling to make 

518
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:22,734
any final claims about what's immortal 
and what's mortal and how those things 

519
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:29,940
are related and how I'm tangled up in 
that.

520
00:27:29,941 --> 00:27:34,290
I don't know,
but I'm so ignorant about that,

521
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:36,120
that I can't say it really terrifies me.

522
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:42,470
There was the one thing is

523
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,340
okay

524
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,410
and obviously interesting about,
about being modern living,

525
00:27:48,411 --> 00:27:49,244
you know,
uh,

526
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,680
at the beginning of the 21st century is 
that,

527
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,573
is that so many of us have grown up 
without any reliance on the thought of 

528
00:27:57,861 --> 00:27:59,900
the possibility of afterlife.
Uh,

529
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,113
though,
though what's also interesting is that 

530
00:28:03,321 --> 00:28:06,080
we also living in a time when there are 
many,

531
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,933
uh,
people who increasingly imagine the 

532
00:28:09,861 --> 00:28:13,160
possibility of extending the lifespan of
consciousness,

533
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,060
if not of the physical bodies by,
by the process of,

534
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:17,490
of,
uh,

535
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,790
by imagining that consciousness can be 
digitized and,

536
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:21,510
and,
and,

537
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:25,280
and that can be then uploaded or 
downloaded into,

538
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:26,810
into,
uh,

539
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,890
into,
uh,

540
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,880
add the vehicles of life rather than the

541
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,873
uploaded into our digital reality where 
there's at least 26 digital virgins 

542
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:38,870
waiting for you.
I think that's the ultimate,

543
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,630
the number is 76,
seven.

544
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,553
Okay.

545
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,493
What,
do you have any response to that 

546
00:28:50,661 --> 00:28:55,661
proposition that that is possible to 
imagine consciousness to be made,

547
00:28:56,061 --> 00:28:56,930
to be a tonal?

548
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,770
I think it's silly,

549
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,273
technically silly because there's just 
so many things it doesn't take into 

550
00:29:10,141 --> 00:29:10,974
account.
Like it's based on a very peculiar 

551
00:29:12,781 --> 00:29:16,230
apprehension of what constitutes 
consciousness.

552
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,483
Like it's a shallow,
it's a shallow approach to a deep 

553
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:21,540
problem.
So for example,

554
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,793
we,
it seems that consciousness requires 

555
00:29:24,481 --> 00:29:27,100
embodiment.
Now,

556
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,600
you know,
modern Kwanzaa,

557
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,443
I atheists have the idea that sort of 
alerts at the bottom of their thinking 

558
00:29:35,111 --> 00:29:39,340
that the soul is sort of like a,
it's sort of like a disembodied ghost.

559
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:43,030
It looks like a body,
but you can see through it and have some

560
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,580
of the attributes of a body because 
otherwise it couldn't exist.

561
00:29:45,581 --> 00:29:48,790
But like it's very vague and ill 
defined.

562
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:49,301
And so,
okay,

563
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:50,950
you're going to upload your 
consciousness.

564
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,360
Okay,
fine.

565
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,770
So what exactly are you uploading?
You're not blowing,

566
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,070
you're not blowing your anxiety.
You can upload your pain,

567
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,390
you cannot devote your hunger.

568
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,760
Are you going to upload your sexual 
desire or are going to be free of all of

569
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,240
that?
Okay,

570
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:09,370
well you want to be free of all that.
Well,

571
00:30:09,371 --> 00:30:10,960
what are you then,
what's left of you?

572
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,510
If your limitations are all gone,
what's left of you?

573
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,030
That's a weird thing because you think,
well,

574
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,730
if your limitations are all gone,
then you're,

575
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,243
you're without limitation.
It's like the genie has escaped from 

576
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:25,510
the,
from the little lamp.

577
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,850
Well you need the lamp.
No,

578
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,140
no lab,
no genie.

579
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,780
So you're an upload your consciousness.
Oh yeah.

580
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,250
And then what are you going to do,
you know,

581
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,133
sit inside a computer,
why you can have any motivation to do 

582
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:40,060
anything.
Because like your motivation,

583
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:44,560
we know your motivation is all tied 
intrinsically to your physiology.

584
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,170
So,
so it's,

585
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,033
it's like to me that the engineers who 
talk about it's Marvin minsky mostly 

586
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:55,210
he's talked about uploading and Curt 
Swan.

587
00:30:55,211 --> 00:30:56,440
Yeah,
but it's from,

588
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,303
it's from Mitski essentially.
It's like there's lots of things that 

589
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,024
are smart about engineers,
but metaphysical philosophy is not one 

590
00:31:04,151 --> 00:31:04,984
of them.
And so I read that stuff and I think 

591
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,463
like

592
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,643
you guys are as bad at talking about 
Meta physics as postmodernist humanists 

593
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:17,334
are talking about engineering.
Like you should just stay out of it 

594
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,190
because it's your,
the,

595
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,303
the approach.
I think the approach is basically 

596
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,163
equivalent to that.
That characterizes a really curious and 

597
00:31:31,091 --> 00:31:36,091
precocious 13 year old.
There's no real thinking that goes along

598
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:37,644
with it.
It's like a dream while we could upload 

599
00:31:39,211 --> 00:31:42,930
our consciousness into a machine.
Well that's a dream.

600
00:31:42,931 --> 00:31:43,764
It's a myth.
It's like the myth of the Golem or the 

601
00:31:46,411 --> 00:31:48,150
myth of Frankenstein.
Obviously,

602
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,673
if we can only transcend this body and 
put ourselves into something else was 

603
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,820
like,
sorry guys,

604
00:31:53,821 --> 00:31:56,760
you're gonna have to do a lot more 
thinking about that issue before you can

605
00:31:56,761 --> 00:31:58,380
have an intelligent discussion about it.

606
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,430
Uh,
Jordan,

607
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:04,230
we will stop now because I think we've 
talked long enough and the next time,

608
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,540
uh,
whatever that's going to be,

609
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:07,374
we will then talk about next topic,
which we then managed to squeeze into 

610
00:32:10,771 --> 00:32:13,110
this one,
which is we just have to think about the

611
00:32:13,111 --> 00:32:15,480
future.
I want to say one more thing,

612
00:32:15,481 --> 00:32:16,314
just talk

613
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,353
part of what I was this little,
this 42 exercises is sort of an 

614
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,970
exercise.
I'm hoping that will involve the mapping

615
00:32:25,971 --> 00:32:26,804
of very deep ideas onto sort of everyday
issues cause deep ideas should be 

616
00:32:32,301 --> 00:32:33,134
related to everyday issues in a niche 
like indirectly because everyday things 

617
00:32:37,101 --> 00:32:41,210
are deep.
Now the viewpoint,

618
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,153
like

619
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,450
we've talked about this before,
you and I privately but,

620
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,053
but it,
it's something that has to be stated in 

621
00:32:51,081 --> 00:32:53,300
order to make this kind of conversation 
intelligible.

622
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,920
I am not a materialist.
Like some people say that but they don't

623
00:32:57,921 --> 00:32:59,990
mean it.
But I mean it,

624
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,300
I don't think the most real things of 
the world,

625
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:03,134
our material,
and I think the fact that we think that 

626
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:09,260
they are makes us ill.
That's existential illness.

627
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,183
It's actually an illness and the reason 
it's an illness is it speak it because 

628
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,324
it's predicated on a view of the world 
that's solely incomplete that it can't 

629
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:19,160
function.
Now,

630
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:20,323
one of the pieces of evidence that it 
can't function is people's existential 

631
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:27,800
angst and the fact that they're driven 
to find systems of meaning,

632
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,310
especially in the 20th century that were
extremely pathological.

633
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:34,220
They're driven into the arms of 
pathological replacements.

634
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,060
There's an alternative,
like if you're not a materialist,

635
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:39,470
you have to pause it.

636
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,303
That something else.
Is that the ground of being cause it's 

637
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:43,334
material for materialists.
Even though if you look into material 

638
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:48,290
hard enough like the quantum physicists 
do,

639
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,550
it turns into something that's so unlike
material that you know you might as well

640
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,413
not if you've been bothered with the 
whole materialism to begin with because 

641
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,770
if you think religion is weird,
you know you should read quantum physics

642
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:01,604
for a while.
I don't think that material is the most 

643
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:06,920
real thing.
I think the most real thing is meaning.

644
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,430
And I think that meaning is a real 
thing.

645
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,470
Not only that,
it's real,

646
00:34:11,471 --> 00:34:12,304
that it's the most real thing.
And I also think that you're set up 

647
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:15,644
physiologically,
materially if you want all the evidence 

648
00:34:19,821 --> 00:34:24,320
is that your physiology responds to 
meaning and not to material reality.

649
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,420
That's when,
when we talk about the future,

650
00:34:26,421 --> 00:34:27,254
we'll talk about that a little bit more 
because when you interact with the 

651
00:34:29,661 --> 00:34:30,494
future,
what you're interacting with is the 

652
00:34:32,181 --> 00:34:34,010
meaning of possibilities.

653
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:38,060
That is what the future is.
It's the meaning of possibilities.

654
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,630
And I don't mean that metaphorically.
I mean that literally,

655
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:42,973
and not only do I mean that literally,
I mean biologically in that that's what 

656
00:34:47,091 --> 00:34:49,570
your brain does.
Your brain apprehends the mirror,

657
00:34:49,571 --> 00:34:50,404
yet meaningful possibilities of the 
multiple futures that could manifest 

658
00:34:55,641 --> 00:34:57,980
themselves.
And that's what you interact with.

659
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,203
And modern people are so dopey.
They think they interact with material 

660
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,090
and that makes them sick.
That idea because it's,

661
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:08,000
it's not a sustaining idea and they 
don't even act that way.

662
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:09,350
They say things like,
well,

663
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,813
you know,
you have to make the most of your 

664
00:35:11,781 --> 00:35:12,614
potential.
And then they don't even notice that 

665
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:15,763
they're saying something that's entirely
nonsensical from a materialist 

666
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:19,370
perspective.
It's like,

667
00:35:19,371 --> 00:35:21,560
what the hell is this potential that 
you're talking about?

668
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,370
You can't measure it.
It only exists in possibility.

669
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:26,563
It only exists as something you could 
conceivably bring into being or 

670
00:35:30,651 --> 00:35:33,830
interfere with.
Even though everyone knows that,

671
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,470
you know,
not living up to your po possibility and

672
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:40,470
not fulfilling potential is a great sin.
No one notices that.

673
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,470
You just can't say something like that 
and be a materialist.

674
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,573
We will,
we will continue this next time and we 

675
00:35:49,051 --> 00:35:51,520
talk about the multiple futures,
uh,

676
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,680
but for the time being,
thanks Jordan and see you again.
