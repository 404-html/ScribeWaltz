1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,160
Okay,

2
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,183
I guess since you started your videos 
and since you started having troubles 

3
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,394
with know with human rights tribunals or
threats by u of t and I just think it's 

4
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:28,800
common sense that I said that I think 
that promoting critical thinking,

5
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,203
helping people to be able to tolerate 
subjects that they may not feel 

6
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:35,380
comfortable about,
but then they should be able to hear and

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,450
process not based on emotions but based 
on an actual analysis of the facts,

8
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:40,284
the evidence,
the reality versus some agenda being 

9
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:42,834
shoved down their throat,
whether it's media through the 

10
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:48,030
professors and anyone teaching in 
academia knows that there are professors

11
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:52,200
who have no problem with basically 
teaching their truths as fact.

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,393
And so I've been promoting this,
promoting it within my own organization 

13
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:58,440
that are the Ontario Psychological 
Association.

14
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,010
I got a lot of flack from other 
psychologists who thought,

15
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:02,844
no,
we can't allow this type of speech to 

16
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:04,530
happen.

17
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,970
That's a discussion that you're supposed
to have had.

18
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:07,400
The Travis didn't really,
um,

19
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,453
it was October I believe when you had 
those other professors coming in and 

20
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:11,910
talking about,
you know,

21
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,420
the issue somewhat.
Some psychologists wrote pieces in,

22
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,523
in national art,
a media publication saying this kind of 

23
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:21,590
discussion should not happen.
Yeah,

24
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,150
okay.
So and this from psychologists,

25
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:24,984
the ones who are supposed to be best 
trained to be able to tolerate the 

26
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:29,310
discomfort that goes around.
It goes along with,

27
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,500
you know,
discussing uncomfortable topics.

28
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,200
So I was hoping for you to be able to 
share with,

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,120
you know,
the audience,

30
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,320
your experience in the last few months 
in trying to promote this.

31
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:40,800
I,
you know,

32
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,210
what you were basically trying to 
promote,

33
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,520
which I think I'll let you describe in 
your own words.

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,633
Okay.

35
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,650
So where do you think about those videos
for a minute?

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,080
Well,
I think there were two things that.

37
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,850
Oh,
I should give you some background on the

38
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:58,684
videos I guess.
I mean I just made them in my office at 

39
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:03,510
home.
I wasn't,

40
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,910
I had no idea what the consequence would
be.

41
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:10,120
I was just trying to sort out my 
thoughts about pardoning both.

42
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,720
Not so much bill [inaudible] as the 
background policies that surround it,

43
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,913
especially on the Ontario Human Rights 
Commission website because the bill 

44
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:20,820
itself looks rather innocuous.
It's only about two paragraphs long.

45
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,820
The only part of it that isn't innocuous
is the insistence that

46
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,770
the insistence on transforming the hate,
the hate speech codes,

47
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:36,120
including including harassment and 
discrimination based on gender.

48
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,820
What was it?
Gender identity and gender expression,

49
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:41,060
right in the hate speech codes.
I thought that's.

50
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,990
That's weird that there's something out 
there.

51
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,093
Anyways,
I started digging more into the 

52
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:45,714
background on the Ontario Human Rights 
Commission website and the policies 

53
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,624
surrounding bill [inaudible] to call 
them appalling is barely scratched the 

54
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:52,854
surface there.
They're unbelievably badly written and 

55
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,124
contract internally contradictory and 
over inclusive and dangerous and I mean 

56
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,870
they do things,
for example,

57
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:02,704
like make employer's responsible for all
the speech acts of their employees 

58
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,610
whether they have intended or unintended
consequences.

59
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:14,050
That's completely the only reason you 
would write a law like that is to get as

60
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:17,710
many employers in trouble as you could 
possibly manage because there's no other

61
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:21,830
reason for formulating the legislation 
that way and I've also.

62
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:25,930
A colleague of mine came in recently 
from at the university and he's starting

63
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:26,764
to teach a little bit about the 
background for this sort of thing and 

64
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,334
one of his classes and he showed me the 
developmental progression of the 

65
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:34,174
policies surrounding bill c 16 and 
originally they were written in a much 

66
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:37,624
more in a tighter format,
but then they were farmed out for what 

67
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:45,601
they call public consultation,
which basically meant they ran them by a

68
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,140
variety of people who I would say are 
very strongly on the activist end of the

69
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:50,974
political spectrum and they basically,
in order to not bother anyone who they 

70
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:57,310
had consulted with,
they decided,

71
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:58,144
for example,
that gender identity should be nothing 

72
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,000
but subjective choice,
which is.

73
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,310
I don't even know what to say about 
that.

74
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,340
If you're a psychologist and you have 
any sense at all,

75
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,330
that's a completely insane proposition.
It's first of all predicated on the idea

76
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:11,164
that your identity is your subjective 
choice and that's never been the case 

77
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:15,694
for any sort of identity.
Anywhere you you take your identity is 

78
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:19,843
twofold.
The first thing that your identity is a 

79
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,660
functional set of tools to help you 
operate in the world,

80
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,730
meaning read Piaget,
you know,

81
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,480
we've just scratched the surface of 
piaget even and you find out that,

82
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,583
you know,
children start to construct their 

83
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,374
identities really when they're 
breastfeeding because that's when you 

84
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:41,860
first started your social interactions.
You start integrating your re.

85
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,723
Your basic biological reflex is from an 
agenda perspective into something 

86
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:47,014
resembling a social relationship because
breastfeeding actually happens to be 

87
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:53,260
quite a complex act and then you expand 
your,

88
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,153
your developing identity out into the 
small microcosmic social world of the 

89
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,040
family basically starting with your 
mother.

90
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,190
But then you have siblings and your 
father and your relatives,

91
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,053
you know,
conventionally speaking and your 

92
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,473
identity is a negotiating game and 
you're not the only one in charge of it 

93
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,200
by any stretch of the imagination at 
all.

94
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,034
I mean,
one of the things that Piaget pointed 

95
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:19,060
out was that between the ages of two and
four,

96
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:21,610
and I think later research has really 
hammered this home,

97
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,130
that even kids who are hyper aggressive 
at two,

98
00:05:25,131 --> 00:05:27,100
if there's a small proportion of them 
that are like,

99
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:27,934
that learn to integrate their subjective
desires into a broader social game and 

100
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:37,630
become socially acceptable to other 
children and they do that through play,

101
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,903
you know,
what they're doing is playing their 

102
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:40,594
identity into being.
And then once they're older than about 

103
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:45,220
four and they've become properly 
socialized.

104
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:46,054
So other children actually want to play 
with them because that's the critical 

105
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:48,640
issue.

106
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,100
It's the fundamental issue.
Then,

107
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,870
um,
then then the,

108
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,910
the peer community of children helps 
bootstrap their identity up to something

109
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,750
that will eventually approximate and 
adult identity.

110
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,910
But that's functional.
It has nothing to do with whim.

111
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,501
It's,
it's,

112
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:07,540
it's,
that's a,

113
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,250
it's a crazy idea.
And then so,

114
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,113
so partly your identity is the set of 
tools with which you functioned in the 

115
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,630
actual world.
And part of it is a negotiated agreement

116
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:20,490
with the other people around you.
And that's all being taken out of that.

117
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,733
That's,
that's all actually as far as I can 

118
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:25,340
tell,
that's line of theorizing is technically

119
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,203
illegal now in Ontario,
and I'm not even talking about the 

120
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:33,260
potential biological basis of identity 
because of the idea that identity has no

121
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:34,094
biological basis,
that's just wrong it united factually 

122
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:39,044
wrong.
So,

123
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,330
and we've written a social 
constructionist,

124
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,193
we've written a radical social 
constructionist view of identity into 

125
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,810
the law,
but even worse than that,

126
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:48,644
we've gone beyond social constructionism
because piaget was a construction 

127
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:52,640
constructionist into just pure.

128
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,660
When your identity can be at any moment,
what you assume that it's going to be,

129
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,900
that's not a tenable solution.
It's.

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,640
There's nothing about that proposition 
that's reasonable.

131
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,893
So I was looking into this and I thought
this is just beyond comprehension that 

132
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,020
we've written that idea into the 
policies surrounding bill c 16.

133
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,620
So that.
So I made that video.

134
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:15,620
I was trying to sort that out and to 
figure out even what it meant.

135
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,570
The terminology is messy in the extreme.
First of all,

136
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,410
with regards to gender identity,
gender identity is not a spectrum.

137
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,500
It's a modified by modal distribution.
And if you're making law,

138
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:29,090
you don't get to muck around with the 
words,

139
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:29,924
you have to use the right words.
And so it's a modified by mode of 

140
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:33,724
distribution because almost everyone who
has a biological identity of male or 

141
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:41,120
female identifies as male or female.

142
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,650
It's 99 point seven percent and you 
could argue that that's a little tighter

143
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:49,490
than it would be if society was more 
accepting of gender variation,

144
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:52,370
let's say.
But even if it went down to 99 percent,

145
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:56,270
which would be an increase of like
what?

146
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,170
Well,
it would be almost an order of magnitude

147
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:01,004
increase.
You still have the overwhelming number 

148
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:06,050
of people whose gender identity matches 
their biological sex.

149
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,590
And then you can match.
You can stack on top of biological sex,

150
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,930
gender identity,
virtually perfect match.

151
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,970
Then gender expression.
Almost everyone who is biologically male

152
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:17,804
or female who identifies as biologically
male or female expresses themselves as 

153
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:23,354
male or female.
And then the vast majority of them have 

154
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,250
a sexual orientation that's in keeping 
with their,

155
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,133
you know,
in traditional keeping with their 

156
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,620
biological sex,
gender identity and gender expression.

157
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,910
So now we have a laws that says those 
are independent guests.

158
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,753
What?
That's not the definition of 

159
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:39,914
independence and you can't just play 
much games with your legislative 

160
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:45,260
terminology.
It gets,

161
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,940
it gets people in trouble so it's not a 
spectrum and that's that.

162
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,983
It's a modified by mobile distribution.
If there are obviously exceptions and I 

163
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:56,040
never argued once in the videos

164
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,230
that I put out,
despite what,

165
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,210
how people reacted to them that there 
weren't exceptions.

166
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,540
Of course there are exceptions and if 
you look at temperament,

167
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,940
for example,
you know the big differences between men

168
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:08,010
and women are agreeableness and 
neuroticism.

169
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,873
Fundamentally,
women are about half a standard 

170
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,120
deviation,
more agreeable,

171
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,013
that's compassionate blindness,
and they're about half a standard 

172
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:15,864
deviation,
higher in negative emotion and that's 

173
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:20,670
cross cultural by the way,
and it also accounts for the reasons why

174
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:21,504
women are about three to four times more
likely to suffer cross culturally from 

175
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:25,584
depression and anxiety.
Whereas men are more likely to be 

176
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,583
aggressively in prison and to and to 
drink and low agreeableness is actually 

177
00:09:31,711 --> 00:09:34,740
the best predictor of incarceration 
among manner.

178
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,753
Those are solid biological differences,
but if you try to segregate men and 

179
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:40,164
women using only those two dimensions,
you want to get it right about 75 

180
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:43,530
percent of the time.

181
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,280
So there's substantial overlap,
but that still doesn't mean they're,

182
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,163
that's not a spectrum.
And the idea that there are no 

183
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:51,600
biological differences between men and 
women,

184
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,553
it's such a preposterous claim that I 
can't even believe that we would ever 

185
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:57,000
have that discussion.
I mean,

186
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,760
there's,
we have men have wider jaws,

187
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,920
men are taller,
they have broader shoulders,

188
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,920
women have more endurance and endurance 
sports.

189
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,370
Women have a subcutaneous layer of fat.
The shape is different.

190
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:10,200
The way the arms are placed is 
different,

191
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,230
the voice is different.
Um,

192
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,710
and that's just gross morphology and not
even talking about genitalium.

193
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,980
And then you can look at 
microstructures.

194
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,823
There's differences between men and 
women at every level of the human 

195
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,663
microstructure,
from the cellular all the way up to the 

196
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,260
social.
So like what in the world are we talking

197
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,090
about?
What's going on here?

198
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,300
It's crazy.
So that was video number one.

199
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,403
Video number two was a bloody a human 
resources department at the University 

200
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,100
of Toronto has adopted an equity 
position.

201
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,323
Okay,
so what equity means is that it doesn't 

202
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:47,130
mean equality of opportunity.
It means equality of outcome,

203
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,390
and that is a.
So this is the idea.

204
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,730
The idea is that you take as a social 
institution like a university,

205
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,860
and then you look at the organization of
that university at every single strategy

206
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,770
from the executive level,
all the way down to the student level.

207
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:10,010
Then what you do is you do an analysis 
of each level by community demography,

208
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,483
right?
You get to define the demographic 

209
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,790
characteristics that you're going to 
discuss however,

210
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,653
which is actually a big problem.
Then you make the presupposition that 

211
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,283
unless that organization at every level 
matches the demographic representation 

212
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:27,840
of the people at every level,
then it's corrupt,

213
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,733
oppressive,
and discriminatory and it needs to be 

214
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:31,794
changed.

215
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,671
Okay,
so you think,

216
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:33,810
well,
what's wrong with that?

217
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,090
Every level should have 50 slash 50 men 
and women,

218
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:38,190
let's say.
It's like you're really sure about that.

219
00:11:38,191 --> 00:11:39,810
Are you?
You're so sure about that.

220
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,480
You don't think there's any natural 
differences in interests between men and

221
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:43,710
women?
Well,

222
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,610
if you don't think so then why are most 
psychology classes,

223
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,453
80 percent women and that and that and 
that differentiation is accelerating 

224
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,523
rapidly.
Like I've seen it over the course of my 

225
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:55,594
career from maybe 60 percent men at the 
beginning of my career to like 80 

226
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:02,340
percent women now and men occupy more of
the positions in the stem,

227
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,290
in the stem,
a stem fields,

228
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,530
at least for now.
It's the same in bloody scandinavia.

229
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,980
It's 20 to one nurses,
20 to one women to men,

230
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:12,814
nurses in Scandinavia and 20 to one men 
to women in engineering and that's in 

231
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:23,030
Scandinavia and so what's happening in 
Scandinavia as they've made this site or

232
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,973
egalitarian in terms of its legal and 
social structures is that the gender 

233
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:30,550
differences in personality between men 
and women have got bigger,

234
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,690
not smaller.

235
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,950
So what that means is that social 
constructionism is wrong.

236
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,340
That's what it means.
Wrong disproved.

237
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,233
It's exactly the opposite of what the 
theory would have predicted because the 

238
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:46,300
theory predicted and God only knew how 
it was going to sort itself out.

239
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,880
It's like,
not like people knew this to begin with.

240
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,080
The idea was that as you equalize the 
social,

241
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,130
the social,
uh,

242
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,063
uh,
structure that the differences between 

243
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:59,290
men and women would disappear.
Guess what,

244
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,213
that didn't happen and it's not.
Studies have just a few hundred people 

245
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:03,874
in a few locations,
those are population wide studies and 

246
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:08,710
they'd be replicated multiple times.
So,

247
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:11,050
and the funny thing is,
is that,

248
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,390
so they're temperamental differences 
between men and women.

249
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,813
It's and neuroticism and F and 
agreeableness are not the only 

250
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:20,980
temperamental differences.
So if you fragment extroversion,

251
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:21,814
it fragments into um,
assertiveness and gregariousness women 

252
00:13:25,211 --> 00:13:27,190
are more gregarious.
Men are more assertive.

253
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:32,020
If you fragment conscientiousness into 
orderliness and industriousness ness,

254
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,040
women are more orderly at men are more 
industrious if you fragment openness,

255
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,053
which is the creativity dimension,
into interest in ideas and interest in 

256
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:40,384
aesthetics.
You find that women are more interested 

257
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:44,200
in aesthetics and men are more 
interested in ideas.

258
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,363
So,
so because you've been fractionated the 

259
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,330
big five into 10,
you get gender differences across all of

260
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:52,210
them and they're not trivial either.
They make a difference.

261
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,400
So.
Okay.

262
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:55,234
So anyways,
back to the equity thing of all the 

263
00:13:57,521 --> 00:14:01,510
preposterous and idiotic ideas,
so first of all,

264
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,970
to make gender equity across every 
dimension of a,

265
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,863
of a,
of an organization who have to assume 

266
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,080
that men and women have identical 
interests or and,

267
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:11,914
and temperaments and that if they don't,
the state should intervene to bloody 

268
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:16,414
well ensure that they do,
which is something for all you women to 

269
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:22,540
figure out because now there's many,
many what

270
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,300
positions in society that women 
preferentially occupied.

271
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,133
So what are you going to do about that 
and what are you going to do about the 

272
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:34,930
Asians because they occupy preferential 
positions as well.

273
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,793
You know,
they're overrepresented in all sorts of 

274
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:37,954
professional institutions and the 
probability is that that's going to 

275
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:42,100
increase.
What are you gonna do about that?

276
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:45,320
What about the Jews but are going to do 
about them because they have,

277
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,203
they're in the same position as they 
Asians going to put quotas on all those 

278
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:51,670
people.
What kind of stupidity is bad?

279
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:52,983
And then it's worse too because let's 
say you equalize women and just for the 

280
00:14:56,991 --> 00:14:59,840
sake of argument across all these 
different dimensions of society.

281
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:00,763
Well then what are you going to do and 
you get to equalize for black women and 

282
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,623
Latino women and Asian women.
Are you going to sub type black women 

283
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:10,430
because it's not like they're all the 
same.

284
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,443
Are you going to ensure that women from 
lower classes are are represented just 

285
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:16,634
as much as women from upper classes and 
how many generations back are you going 

286
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,100
to go to check that?
What about intelligence?

287
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,380
What about attractiveness?
How about height?

288
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:28,220
How about weight?
So the problem with the fractionation by

289
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:29,054
group identity is that it's endless.
There's no way of ensuring equality 

290
00:15:33,171 --> 00:15:34,004
across groups because there's an 
infinite number of groups you can 

291
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,470
fragment group identity all the way down
into the level of the individual,

292
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,333
which is exactly what you should do,
which is what we already did in the 

293
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,210
west.
We figured,

294
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:47,030
well,
the ultimate diverse population,

295
00:15:47,031 --> 00:15:50,570
there's a population of individuals.
So you let the individuals sorted out,

296
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,140
no,
no,

297
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,120
we're going to replace that with group.
Well,

298
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:53,973
what that means for the bloody social 
activists is that they'll be able to 

299
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:57,224
play this game forever because you can 
continually functioning group identity 

300
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,790
ad nauseum and so the system will never 
be equal and you can bloody well be sure

301
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:09,380
that as we implement social policy to 
make sure that all outcomes are equal,

302
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,423
the amount of space that you personally 
are going to have to maneuver in is 

303
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:15,440
going to shrink and shrink and shrink 
and shrink.

304
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,930
We've already seen that happen in many 
societies.

305
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,270
You think we would learn from the 20th 
century,

306
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,360
so that's the equity issue,
and then worse,

307
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,223
even this is the HR and equity people 
there actually mucking about with 

308
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,590
people's unconscious biases.
So this is what we want,

309
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:31,424
right?
We want your employers and the state to 

310
00:16:33,981 --> 00:16:34,814
reeducate you so that your perceptions,
because that's what we're talking about 

311
00:16:38,271 --> 00:16:39,104
with regards to unconscious bias,
so that your perceptions fall into in 

312
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,440
accordance with their demands and not 
even your voluntary perceptions.

313
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,840
By the way,
your,

314
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,620
your involuntary unconscious perceptions
have to be retrained.

315
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,810
Okay?
So maybe that's not so good,

316
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,733
especially when you look at that bloody 
implicit association test mastering 

317
00:16:58,161 --> 00:16:58,994
biology from Harvard and Anthony 
Greenwald from the University of 

318
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,223
Washington.
So biology is an avowed Marxist and 

319
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:06,943
Greenwald and both bloody well know and 
have written that there are implicit 

320
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:14,450
association task has neither the 
reliability northern validity to be used

321
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:17,180
as an individual diagnostic tests.
They know it.

322
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,970
Sorry,
just something like I've collected about

323
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,100
that in my class that not everyone is 
aware of that.

324
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:21,934
Do you want to just give up?
I can bring up a powerpoint slide or do 

325
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:24,880
you want to.
Why don't you do that?

326
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,960
Do you want,
do you want to do that?

327
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:26,803
Yeah.
So I'll let you take over when you do 

328
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:31,060
that.
So despite the fact that.

329
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,013
Sorry,
this

330
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,620
will take me a minute.
So

331
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,920
yeah.
Well despite this,

332
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,900
okay.
So the implicit association task,

333
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,300
the principle is this word association 
game.

334
00:17:45,301 --> 00:17:49,080
It's actually predicated,
I would say on psychoanalytic ideas,

335
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,610
most particularly on union ideas because
young develop the association test many,

336
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:54,570
many,
many years ago.

337
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:55,404
But it purports to investigate whether 
you are unconsciously bias towards one 

338
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:02,430
group against another group.
Could be gender,

339
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:04,080
could be ethnicity,
could be race,

340
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:05,700
could be attractiveness,
whatever.

341
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,893
But the problem is,
is that when you give the same person 

342
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:12,000
that damn I met twice,
they don't get the same results.

343
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:16,680
So there's a rule for diagnostic tasks.
And the rule is the reliability test,

344
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:17,514
retest reliability has to exceed 
something like point eight or point 

345
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:22,320
nine,
point eight at least.

346
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,840
So the big five does that,
Iq tests do that,

347
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:26,730
but there's a dam,
uh,

348
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,630
there's damn few tasks that passed that 
reliability criteria.

349
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,610
And the,
it is the only reliable,

350
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,310
I don't remember precisely,
but I think it's about point five,

351
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:36,144
which isn't even,
it's not even near close enough to be 

352
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:40,020
used as a diagnostic test.

353
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,930
Plus it's not valid.
So what does that mean?

354
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,310
Let's say I assess your unconscious bias
and give you a diagnosis.

355
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,383
Well,
there's no evidence that it predicts 

356
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,570
your behavior.
So.

357
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,160
So what,
what good is it?

358
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,420
What good is it?
Well,

359
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:55,254
it's good if you want people to send you
to retraining exercises so that you can 

360
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:00,354
have your perceptions adjusted in the 
direction that your organization in the 

361
00:19:03,761 --> 00:19:06,360
state thinks is proper and that's 
happening everywhere.

362
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:09,120
I got letters this week already for 
people at CBC.

363
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,180
It's becoming mandatory there.
St Mike's Hospital,

364
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,043
same thing,
and they've decided that all of their 

365
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:18,900
micro institutions within the hospital 
will be equitable.

366
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:22,800
There'll be 50 percent women and 50 
percent men at every single level of the

367
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:26,010
organization or the organization is 
corrupt and oppressive.

368
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,880
It's like it's and that it's spreading 
so fast.

369
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:30,714
You can't believe that.
I wrote Mazur and Banaji and Anthony 

370
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:33,910
Greenwald yesterday.

371
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,910
I hadn't set it off to some of my 
colleagues say,

372
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,833
are you going to come out and make a 
public statement about the fact that 

373
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:40,404
your damn test is being used by 
pathological people for nefarious 

374
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:45,600
purposes?
It's like,

375
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,434
well,
we'll see what they have to say about 

376
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,990
that.
I was a bit more polite in my letters,

377
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,873
but there's no excuse for it.
There's absolutely no excuse for it and 

378
00:19:53,671 --> 00:19:54,504
as far as I'm concerned,
is part of the broader corruption of 

379
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,280
social psychology.
You guys may know or may not.

380
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,114
The social psychology has been rife with
with a controversy and scandal over the 

381
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:05,784
last three or four years and a big part 
of the reason for that is it's damn 

382
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:09,354
corrupt.
Discipline and that use of the iat for 

383
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,740
political reasons is a perfect example 
of that.

384
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,270
There is no excuse for it and the people
at St Mike's,

385
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,791
you know,
they say,

386
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,010
well,
this is scientifically validated.

387
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:20,850
It's like,
no,

388
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:21,684
it's not and worse.
Let's say you do have unconscious bias 

389
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:28,440
just for the sake of argument and you 
could measure it reliably,

390
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,050
which you can't,
and then it was valid,

391
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,003
which it isn't.
Let's say all of those things were in 

392
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:34,764
case there's no evidence whatsoever that
those damn unconscious bias training 

393
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:41,010
programs,
retraining programs have the effect that

394
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,873
they're supposed to have and there's 
some evidence that they actually have 

395
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:45,144
the reverse effect and maybe that's 
because people don't like being marched 

396
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:53,011
off to reeducation by their employers 
after they've been diagnosed as racist.

397
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,920
Even if there's no evidence that they in
fact are so,

398
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:59,380
it's an absolute misuse of psychology 
and it's in.

399
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:01,000
It's.
It's politically motivated.

400
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,820
It's politically motivated.
It's an assault on freedom.

401
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,990
Anyways,
I made those two videos and I took,

402
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:08,883
tried to take the HR and equity people 
at unt to task because they made that 

403
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,570
training mandatory for their hr people.

404
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,403
I thought,
you don't have the right as an employer 

405
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:16,923
to invade the unconscious structures of 
your employee's minds and alter their 

406
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:23,020
political perspective.
Even though you can't do it.

407
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,243
You don't have the right to do that and 
to think about it as something you 

408
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:28,420
should do.
As a matter of course,

409
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:33,421
as part of your ethical duty is
you really want that.

410
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,593
You really want that.
That's what you want your employers to 

411
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:37,084
be able to do.
Figure out independently of your 

412
00:21:40,271 --> 00:21:41,104
behavior whether or not you're like 
you're a racist or classist or or a 

413
00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:45,754
misogynist or whatever that happens to 
be and you already think that the 

414
00:21:49,271 --> 00:21:51,490
bureaucrats at the university,
for example,

415
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,713
or bureaucrats anywhere for that matter 
are actually capable and qualified of 

416
00:21:56,771 --> 00:22:00,030
doing such a thing properly without 
doing far more damage than,

417
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,540
than any possible.
Good.

418
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,820
Well,
so anyways,

419
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:04,654
I made those two videos trying to sort 
this out into investigated in them for 

420
00:22:08,171 --> 00:22:10,570
whatever reason,
you know the proverbial well,

421
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:11,404
you know what happened by within two 
months there was 180 newspaper articles 

422
00:22:15,131 --> 00:22:15,964
written about it and I don't know how 
many millions of people have watched 

423
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:19,054
these things online now,
but it's plenty and so what that also 

424
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:22,354
means is I put my finger on something 
because who cares what it did when it 

425
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,060
professor from the University of Toronto
does with his spare time at midnight.

426
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,163
No one should care.
I should have had my 15 minutes of 

427
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:34,480
notoriety if that.
But that isn't what happened.

428
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,583
It was,
it was major news in Canada for three 

429
00:22:37,031 --> 00:22:39,690
months and I'm still talking to people 
all over the world about it.

430
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,690
I get a hundred letters a day,
at least I can't keep up with them about

431
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:44,524
pete from people who are being cornered 
in all sorts of ways by their idiot 

432
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:50,563
employers and these safe space 
propositions at universities and the 

433
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:55,210
restrictions on their speech.
They can.

434
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,830
They tell me constantly,
well,

435
00:22:56,831 --> 00:22:59,470
I really agree with you,
but I'm afraid to say anything about it.

436
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,970
So like,
oh good.

437
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:04,900
That's a wonderful position for us to be
in where people are afraid.

438
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,003
They're afraid to speak their minds,
what the hell and it's not getting 

439
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:12,100
better and if we don't do something 
about,

440
00:23:12,101 --> 00:23:13,120
it's going to get a lot worse.

441
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,050
You saw what happened at Berkeley.
That's just a taste of what's to come.

442
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,023
You know,
one day there's going to be an 

443
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,483
antifascist demonstration with a little 
bit of violence and the bad guys on the 

444
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:24,694
other side.
You're going to come out and we're not 

445
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:29,860
gonna like that very much.
So maybe we should get our acts together

446
00:23:29,861 --> 00:23:32,110
and stop that from happening before it 
actually happens,

447
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,540
unless that's what you want and I 
wouldn't recommend it.

448
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:35,643
We have a pretty sophisticated society 
and it wouldn't take much to put a 

449
00:23:38,441 --> 00:23:41,350
spanner into the spokes and with 
everybody on their forehead.

450
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,790
So wake up for Christ's sake.
It's this is not good.

451
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,370
And the fact that the fact that,
you know,

452
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:50,204
the bloody federal government has 
decided that they won't let people pick 

453
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:56,450
the judiciary or unless they take 
unconscious bias retraining.

454
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,940
Right.
What hail.

455
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,180
It's crazy.
So

456
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,020
anyways,
that's what happened

457
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,040
in addition to ideologically driven.
Just to that,

458
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,870
do you think of.
I'm always quite cynical.

459
00:24:11,871 --> 00:24:12,704
Do you think it's also a make work 
project for a bunch of people that they 

460
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,721
figure,
you know,

461
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:16,910
we can create these tests that aren't 
valid,

462
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:18,650
aren't reliable,
but we've got an industry,

463
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:19,683
you know,
that that's going to keep going forever 

464
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:21,374
now.
But you'd never expect social 

465
00:24:22,551 --> 00:24:26,240
psychologists to be careerists with you?
Yes.

466
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,230
Yes,
definitely.

467
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:28,970
Well,
I mean it got out of hand too.

468
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:29,960
It's not,
you know,

469
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:31,910
people don't necessarily plan these 
things.

470
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:34,040
I'm sure that the Ontario Human Rights 
Commission,

471
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,190
when they were talking about preferred 
pronoun use,

472
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,053
had no idea whatsoever that within four 
years of introducing the policies that 

473
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:46,400
there would be 71 different gender 
identity categories.

474
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,590
No one saw that coming.
How could you possibly see that coming?

475
00:24:49,591 --> 00:24:50,424
And I don't think Banerji and Greenwald 
had any idea that there tests would be 

476
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:58,070
transformed into an implement public 
policy so rapidly.

477
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,093
Right?
So,

478
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,980
okay.
And just for those who are interested,

479
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:01,670
the,
uh,

480
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,340
the implicit associations,
their implicit attitudes test,

481
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:05,960
um,
my students,

482
00:25:05,961 --> 00:25:07,970
I always give a link to that.
And if anyone's interested,

483
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:08,804
I can give you a link where you can go 
to the test and actually do it yourself 

484
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:11,744
and find out.
Because the assumption is that if you 

485
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:16,010
are implicitly racist,
so explicitly racist.

486
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,070
Say I hate blacks,
I say implicitly racist.

487
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,600
Oh No.
Some of my best friends.

488
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:26,590
But when you do this test,
the idea is that if you're shown a black

489
00:25:27,471 --> 00:25:29,330
person's face,
okay.

490
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,613
Versus a white person's face,
you're more likely to associate that 

491
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:33,464
black person with us a violence.
So you're basically being primed 

492
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,000
unconsciously is when you see a black 
face,

493
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,230
if you subsequently see a weapon and 
you're asked to decide whether this is a

494
00:25:42,231 --> 00:25:43,064
weapon or a tool there more quickly 
going to say weapon because you're 

495
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:47,970
already thinking dangerous violence 
weapons because you know,

496
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,823
you have this negative association of 
blacks with weapons and you'll do that 

497
00:25:51,921 --> 00:25:55,460
faster than when you see a white face,
the white face to be more neutral.

498
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,563
So whether you see after the white face,
a gun or a weapon in theory should be 

499
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,510
about equal,
equal time to determine whether you know

500
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,450
it is one or the other,
things like that.

501
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:06,284
This is the kind of test that they do 
and they've associated or they've done 

502
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:08,804
this test as Dr Peterson,
same with countless other types of 

503
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:13,790
constructs.
And again,

504
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:16,550
the reliability,
the validity is not just suspect,

505
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:17,850
it's just,
it's not existent.

506
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,060
And um,
as I said,

507
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:21,500
if you'd like to try it out,
if,

508
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:22,011
if,
um,

509
00:26:22,011 --> 00:26:23,930
if you're a student check out on the 
bright space page,

510
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:25,360
if you're not,
email me,

511
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:28,540
facebook me and it'll give you the link 
and you could have done it too,

512
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,740
like I think 50 different,
at least you know,

513
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,900
Democrat Democrats,
Republican,

514
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,263
the vanilla strawberry,
that there's all these different things 

515
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:40,520
that you can do and see where your 
implicit or unconscious biases are.

516
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,623
And as Dr Peterson saying,
it's getting out of hand and this whole 

517
00:26:43,261 --> 00:26:44,094
idea of the gender pronouns,
because during the debate that you had 

518
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:51,291
or whatever that was at the u of t,
one of the people that I think she was a

519
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:55,460
lawyer,
very condescendingly ran across with.

520
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,393
That's right.
She's like,

521
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,140
oh,
this kind of thing would never happen.

522
00:26:58,141 --> 00:26:59,130
You don't know what you're talking 
about.

523
00:26:59,131 --> 00:26:59,700
What,
first of all,

524
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,040
the Human Ontario human rights tribunal 
page,

525
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,580
they specifically say that Jen,
you know,

526
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:04,961
that,
uh,

527
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:09,120
you have to identify people by their 
preferred identity or expression,

528
00:27:09,121 --> 00:27:12,370
which includes pronoun usage.
It's there on their page.

529
00:27:12,371 --> 00:27:14,930
It's not explicitly stated in Bill 
[inaudible],

530
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,073
but the Ontario human rights tribunal 
who will in fact enact any type of 

531
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,200
action against somebody who's,
you know,

532
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:24,060
who's violated these policies.
Okay.

533
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:25,440
It's on there.
Very page.

534
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,990
And I know you spoke about your own 
experience.

535
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,820
I hope that because not everyone saw the
debate.

536
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,510
Can you just talk about that part where 
it's speaking to other professionals who

537
00:27:33,511 --> 00:27:35,740
don't seem to be ideologically driven 
like Kaufman?

538
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,380
Uh,
what they said about the,

539
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:38,214
the risks.
Oh,

540
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,810
sexually,
this is so important.

541
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,060
It was interesting.
I mean,

542
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:45,540
she's,
she's definitely not looking at this the

543
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:46,374
same way that I knew.
One of the things she said we're in a 

544
00:27:49,171 --> 00:27:50,004
rather condescending manner was that I 
wouldn't be sent to jail even though I 

545
00:27:53,731 --> 00:27:55,380
wanted to be.
I'm paraphrasing,

546
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:58,330
but that's roughly what she said,
but that you know,

547
00:27:58,331 --> 00:27:59,164
that the human rights tribunal could 
take away my property in my wages and 

548
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:04,134
all of that,
but that seemed to be okay for her as 

549
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:06,084
long as it didn't extend to jail.
But that's also nonsense because if 

550
00:28:08,941 --> 00:28:09,774
you're,
if you're found guilty by the human 

551
00:28:11,611 --> 00:28:13,170
rights started getting land,
you don't pay,

552
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:14,004
then that's contempt of court and that 
goes to a different court and then they 

553
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:17,760
put you in jail and that's already 
happened.

554
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,870
So it's,
it's,

555
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:22,650
it's crooked lawyer,
hand waving fundamentally,

556
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,330
and it's an attempt to play down the 
significance of the law.

557
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,223
You go and read about you online and 
read about the powers of the human 

558
00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:32,940
rights tribunal and then see how safe 
you feel.

559
00:28:32,941 --> 00:28:36,270
So here's one of the things they can do.
This is section one,

560
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:37,104
point six.
It's in a document about powers of the 

561
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:43,170
powers of the tribunals.
They call them social justice tribunals.

562
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:44,004
In Ontario,
they actually called the social justice 

563
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:47,430
tribunal.
It's mind boggling.

564
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,623
They can suspend precedent,
lead normal legal precedent and 

565
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,000
jurisprudential tradition in the pursuit
of their age.

566
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,640
That's one of the.
It's actually documented as one of their

567
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,290
powers.
Think about that.

568
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:04,850
Like we live in a society that's 
essentially bound by the restrictions of

569
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,703
English common law.
English common law is one of the most 

570
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:12,470
remarkable
developments of civilization ever,

571
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,870
period.
Because what?

572
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,170
See,
in the English system,

573
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,530
basically the presupposition is that you
have all the rights,

574
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,770
there are,
they're not enumerate,

575
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,643
you just have all of them except when 
one of those rights imposes a 

576
00:29:26,011 --> 00:29:26,844
restriction on someone else and then 
they get irritated you and take you to 

577
00:29:29,341 --> 00:29:32,880
court and then the judge sorts out who's
who has which micro,

578
00:29:32,881 --> 00:29:33,714
right and then that's laid out is 
precedent and so English common law is 

579
00:29:36,661 --> 00:29:41,661
this tremendous body of evolved doctrine
about how the infinite number

580
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,240
of human rights that each individual has
interacts with everyone else's rights.

581
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:51,241
And like back when Trudeau Trudeau 
brought the human rights code,

582
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,670
the bill of rights,
the Canadian bill of rights,

583
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,683
there were lots of people who were upset
by it because it's a different form of 

584
00:29:58,241 --> 00:29:59,860
legal reasoning.
The bill of rights says,

585
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:02,560
here's the rights you have that the 
government is granting you.

586
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,010
That's not how it works under the 
English code.

587
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,840
The English code is you have all the 
rights there are,

588
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,890
but they rub up against other people's.
Right?

589
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:10,724
So we have to sort that out.
We do that with court and precedent and 

590
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:18,181
that's what the Human Rights Commission 
and tried people in Ontario can dispense

591
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:21,130
with if they want,
and the reason there,

592
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,710
I know the reason that they put that 
line in there,

593
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:24,544
it's because the social justice 
hypothesis is that the legal structures 

594
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:31,090
of Western civilization are oppressive.

595
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,460
Patriarchal,
uh,

596
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:34,803
are oppressive and patriarchal and so 
it's perfectly reasonable to toss them 

597
00:30:37,841 --> 00:30:38,674
over.
If you're in pursuit of something like 

598
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:40,900
social justice,
it's like,

599
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,340
that's fine.
People,

600
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,780
sure,
go ahead and do that.

601
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:44,614
But if you think that you can transform 
what we have already now into some kind 

602
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:52,840
of utopia,
then you're dangerous because that isn't

603
00:30:52,841 --> 00:30:56,470
how the world works and Utopians it'd be
more dangerous than any other people for

604
00:30:56,471 --> 00:30:58,840
the last hundred years.
That's for sure.

605
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,680
Like there's all sorts of things wrong 
with Western society always,

606
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:03,514
and there always will be,
but compared to 85 to 90 percent of the 

607
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:10,000
rest of the planet,
this is bloody heaven.

608
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,050
And that's why people want to move here.
So you can say,

609
00:31:14,051 --> 00:31:14,884
well,
it's corrupt compared to my imaginary 

610
00:31:16,061 --> 00:31:16,990
utopia.
It's like,

611
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:18,010
yeah,
that's for sure.

612
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:18,844
It certainly is,
but if your imaginary utopia was 

613
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:25,300
realized in in hardcore politics over a 
30 year period,

614
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,700
everyone would be out in the streets 
starving to death.

615
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,893
We already know that because it happened
multiple times throughout the 20th 

616
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:34,690
century in societies that were.
Well,

617
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:37,180
they weren't as sophisticated as our 
society is now,

618
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:38,014
but they were plenty sophisticated for 
their time and you'll hear the neo 

619
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:42,094
Marxist types.
This is the most annoying argument ever 

620
00:31:43,811 --> 00:31:45,130
anyone ever makes.
They say,

621
00:31:45,131 --> 00:31:45,964
well,
what happened in the Soviet Union that 

622
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:49,210
wasn't real communism?
It's like first,

623
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,350
Oh yes,
it was.

624
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:53,950
That's why it also happened in China,
which was a very different society,

625
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,950
but what they really mean when they say 
that as well.

626
00:31:56,951 --> 00:32:00,250
You know that stellan character,
he wasn't such a good guy.

627
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:03,370
He didn't really know how to implement 
the Marxist doctrines,

628
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:04,204
but me,
I'm pretty pure of heart and if you 

629
00:32:05,771 --> 00:32:07,840
would have made me dictator for 20 
years,

630
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:10,330
then the utopia would have arrived as 
promised.

631
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,800
It's like,
first of all,

632
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,680
if you think that there's something 
wrong with you,

633
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,000
you're dangerous.

634
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,013
And second,
let's just say for a minute that some 

635
00:32:18,491 --> 00:32:19,324
saint did get ahold of the tools of 
power and try to implement from each 

636
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:24,124
according to his ability to each 
according to his knee and actually did 

637
00:32:27,491 --> 00:32:30,970
that in a pure and safe manner.
Here's what would happen.

638
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,480
The next people in the revolutionary 
string,

639
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,523
like Stalin would come along and stab 
them in their band in the middle of the 

640
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,700
night and that would be the end of that.
So No.

641
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:45,080
So there's absolutely no excuse 
whatsoever for that sort of thinking.

642
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:48,230
And if you read Solzhenitsyn's school 
like archipelago,

643
00:32:48,231 --> 00:32:49,064
which you should do like everyone should
because it's like the definitive 

644
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:56,060
document of this sort of thing emerged 
that emerged from the 20th century.

645
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,163
Solzhenitsyn laid out with extraordinary
clarity first in his writings on Lenin 

646
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:04,460
and then in his writings on the Soviet 
Union more broadly,

647
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,503
exactly how the current dishes and 
pathological Marxist doctrines were 

648
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:10,544
transformed logically and systematically
into the sorts of laws that killed 

649
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,840
millions of people.
Millions of people.

650
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,360
There were people starving so badly in 
the Soviet Union by the 19 twenties that

651
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:26,150
they had posters telling them not to eat
their children.

652
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:32,800
So we've been down that road already.
So what the hell are we doing?

653
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,800
We're going down that road again under 
the guise of equity,

654
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,360
right?
And,

655
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:37,990
and,
and,

656
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,520
and equality.
Well,

657
00:33:39,521 --> 00:33:42,780
that was the doctrines that promoted 
those laws to begin with.

658
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,650
Not Good.
Okay.

659
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,533
So

660
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,720
when Dr said when you did,
when you talk this way,

661
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:52,643
some people are going to say either 
you're pulling things out of proportion 

662
00:33:54,481 --> 00:33:55,314
or you know,
you've made a huge leap from where we 

663
00:33:56,281 --> 00:33:59,340
are now to where we should be.
And so I think there's a lot of room for

664
00:33:59,341 --> 00:34:00,174
misunderstanding for people,
especially if they have certain 

665
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,600
ideologies that they would like to 
protect.

666
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,703
So one of the reasons I want to invite 
people over was to be able to ask 

667
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,740
questions.
You've heard Song Dr Peterson's,

668
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:13,830
uh,
tenants that he's trying to convey.

669
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:15,890
Um,
and he said,

670
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,610
you know,
and I don't have any videos.

671
00:34:17,611 --> 00:34:19,750
Each person has watched,
but you have an opportunity right now.

672
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:20,970
That's okay.
If someone,

673
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:24,250
if someone has a specific question 
either from somebody talking to Peterson

674
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,900
has said today or things you've heard,
the videos will be negative.

675
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,430
I really want to ask them face to face,
straight up,

676
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,950
what do you mean by this or what is your
solution to that?

677
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,660
Please?
I'm opening up the floor.

678
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:34,803
Just talk really loud.
Please let Mike can pick it up and that 

679
00:34:36,151 --> 00:34:36,984
everyone's going to hear.
Does anybody have a specific question 

680
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:41,220
that you'd like to ask?
Okay.

681
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:42,370
Oh,
sorry.

682
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:45,550
I'll let
Barbara K.

683
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:45,550
okay.

684
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,470
It's a little bit of a Sidebar,
but I've watched.

685
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:48,363
I've watched your videos.
They're resilient than some of your 

686
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,770
longer ones and explained and I.
I'm intrigued by your.

687
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:58,450
I know one of your heroes was a great 
man.

688
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,583
I'm a little disturbed.
I would love to know why was the anti 

689
00:35:03,091 --> 00:35:03,924
Semitic,

690
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,693
you know,
the book that he wrote in which he was 

691
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:10,890
accused of antisemitism has not been yet
translated into English.

692
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,960
There's only one place.

693
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,500
Well,
one of the things that he did,

694
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,353
but he certainly.
There's certainly no sign of 

695
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:18,074
Antisemitism in the Gulag archipelago.
Not as far as I could tell and I don't 

696
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:24,770
think in the other books I've read,
I haven't seen that either.

697
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,633
He did write a book near the end of his 
wife on the role that Jewish 

698
00:35:28,161 --> 00:35:31,190
intellectuals played in the 
establishment of the Soviet Union,

699
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,520
but you can't get it in English,
so I don't know what to say about that.

700
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:39,300
I know that it's being criticized from 
both sides.

701
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:41,160
I would say one side saying,
well,

702
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:43,590
this was a story that needed to be told 
and the other side saying,

703
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:44,424
well,
this sphere is it down anti anti 

704
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,830
Semitism.
So.

705
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,380
But you would ask that question.
That's the question.

706
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,020
Okay,
so

707
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,193
I'm going to venture out on a limb 
because I've been thinking about this 

708
00:35:58,081 --> 00:36:01,990
for a while.
Am I going to venture out on.

709
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,690
No,
I've.

710
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:11,523
No,
I haven't gotten my thoughts formulated 

711
00:36:12,491 --> 00:36:13,324
well enough.
The leftest doctrines tend to be very 

712
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:15,874
attractive,
the intellectuals and so any group 

713
00:36:18,461 --> 00:36:22,960
that's overrepresented in intellectuals 
is likely going to be overrepresented on

714
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:24,490
the left,
the standard of the spectrum,

715
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,560
and there are temperamental reasons for 
that.

716
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,423
We know that if you lean left,
it's because you're hiring openness and 

717
00:36:29,891 --> 00:36:33,400
lower in orderliness and that seems to 
be associated with,

718
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,193
with ICU at least in part,
but I don't want to go into it any more 

719
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:42,970
than that because because I haven't 
thought it through sufficiently,

720
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,403
but I also haven't been able to get a 
coffee and social mentors last book 

721
00:36:46,431 --> 00:36:47,264
because you can't get an English hasn't 
been translated for one reason or 

722
00:36:49,811 --> 00:36:50,930
another.
So,

723
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,620
but I don't think you'll see anything 
like that in the Gulag archipelago.

724
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,630
There's another question before I'm 
going to ask.

725
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,070
Have you asked the question but after we
get back to this,

726
00:37:00,071 --> 00:37:00,904
because you mentioned a number of times,
both the correlates between Iq and the 

727
00:37:04,301 --> 00:37:05,680
left and that um,
the,

728
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:06,514
uh,
people who believe in the support 

729
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,960
thought police are not actually,
they're not left.

730
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:12,790
Is there a whole other category of.
Yeah,

731
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,430
that's such an important distinction to 
turn to in a few minutes.

732
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,110
But first this question please.

733
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:22,980
So the current proposition in
regards to how you

734
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,453
going.

735
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,620
I think we're doing a good job of that 
right now.

736
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,990
I mean,
how fast do you think things,

737
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,720
how fast could you even hope for things 
to change?

738
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,613
Look at what's happened to the situation
and limits inspected with women since 

739
00:37:40,901 --> 00:37:44,620
1970 has changed so fast that people 
can't even keep up.

740
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:45,663
It's not obvious by the way,
are there that it's been particularly 

741
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:51,520
good for women now you could make a case
that it was good for society.

742
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,473
Maybe it's a tough one,
a because the birth rate has plummeted 

743
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,613
and so maybe you don't care about that.
Maybe you think there's too many people 

744
00:37:58,961 --> 00:38:00,280
on the planet already,
whatever,

745
00:38:00,281 --> 00:38:04,840
but if it isn't that easy to figure out 
when something is working property,

746
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,013
one of the things we do know we seem to 
know is there to the degree that rights 

747
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:12,580
are extended to women economic 
prosperity follows.

748
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,013
So you can see worldwide that the 
societies that have extended the rights 

749
00:38:17,591 --> 00:38:18,424
to women most extensively are also the 
societies that seem to be flourishing 

750
00:38:21,521 --> 00:38:24,610
economically and there does seem to be a
causal relationship,

751
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:27,100
but women have paid a big price for 
that.

752
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,413
So what's happened in part is first of 
all for for say a women who were middle 

753
00:38:32,381 --> 00:38:33,214
class or lower their their lights if 
essentially fallen apart because 

754
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:40,330
marriage is now restricted to the ranch,
which is also something to think about.

755
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:42,520
For those of you who think marriage is 
oppressive,

756
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:44,110
patriarchal institution.
It's like,

757
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,153
okay,
then why are only the rich people 

758
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:49,360
getting married?
They're oppressing themselves.

759
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,373
I don't think so.
And so the women who are in the lower 

760
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:53,704
socioeconomic stratus are suffering,
Madelyn and so are their children and 

761
00:38:57,581 --> 00:38:59,380
they have terrible jobs most of the 
time,

762
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:03,970
like jobs in retail where you know,
they're called in every day for the next

763
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:03,970
day.

764
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:07,030
They don't have a schedule that it set 
out ahead of them.

765
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:07,864
They get paid very badly.
They've got kids to take care of and so 

766
00:39:10,571 --> 00:39:11,404
they have no free time.
It makes them really easy targets for 

767
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,133
useless predatory males and it's really 
hard on the kids and that's like 40 

768
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:20,230
percent of the female population.
Something like that.

769
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:22,510
You guys,
while I don't know about all of you,

770
00:39:22,511 --> 00:39:23,344
but you're in university,
you're part of the privileged cognitive 

771
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:26,410
elite.
You know,

772
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,453
so these sorts of things don't really 
touch you the same way they touch other 

773
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:30,814
people and so women are much happier if 
you look at national polls than they 

774
00:39:34,931 --> 00:39:37,990
were say in the late 19 fifties and 
early 19 sixties.

775
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:41,830
And I think that's partly because 
freedom and happiness,

776
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,190
those are not the same thing.
They're not even close.

777
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,460
And now I see young women all the time 
struggling to figure out what to do with

778
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:49,294
their lives because they have no idea 
how to have a job slash career and a 

779
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:52,954
family.

780
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,910
So.
And there's no answer to that.

781
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:57,700
It's a really difficult problem,
you know,

782
00:39:57,701 --> 00:39:58,534
and there's all sorts of ideas.
Like I did a lot of consulting for law 

783
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:01,744
firms for a long time,
about a decade and I had a lot of 

784
00:40:04,031 --> 00:40:07,210
clients who were extremely high 
functioning female lawyers,

785
00:40:07,211 --> 00:40:08,044
younger ones trying to figure out how to
balance their career with their desire 

786
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:13,420
to have a life.
And you know,

787
00:40:13,421 --> 00:40:14,254
you hear all the time about women being 
denied access to positions of power and 

788
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,650
that that's uh,
that's the consequences of prejudice and

789
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:21,640
oppression.
It's like,

790
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:23,200
yeah,
yeah,

791
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,390
everything is caused by the same thing 
first,

792
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,580
right?
You have got one causal principle.

793
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,230
Wonderful.
Now you're a philosopher.

794
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,333
You can figure out everything with it.
It's like the law firms cannot keep 

795
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:35,920
their women in their thirties.
They cannot keep them.

796
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,590
The big law firms,
they all leave.

797
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,020
Why?
Because the women hit 30.

798
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,850
They're brilliant.
Conscientious,

799
00:40:42,851 --> 00:40:44,760
intelligent.
They were deadly in highschool,

800
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:45,970
deadly,
and university.

801
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,640
They nailed law school.
They whipped through their article.

802
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,713
They made partner by the time they were 
30 and it's like they're in a rocket to 

803
00:40:52,061 --> 00:40:55,570
the top position.
What do they find when they get their 80

804
00:40:55,571 --> 00:40:57,670
hour work weeks?
Right?

805
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,470
Because that's one of the things you 
want to think about.

806
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,540
You know,
you think that the people who run things

807
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:03,910
are sitting at home smoking big cigars 
and like

808
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:07,010
telling their minions what to do.
It's like that is not.

809
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:07,873
That's like the 19 twenties millionaire.
That's on the cover of the monopoly 

810
00:41:11,601 --> 00:41:14,540
game.
Going sociological analysis.

811
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:15,710
I know lots of people

812
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:19,430
or like that and they work all the time.
All the time.

813
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,210
Second,
they wake up until the second they go to

814
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:25,120
sleep and they don't just casually work,
you know,

815
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,700
because I know some of you go to the 
library for six hours and you say,

816
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:29,860
well I studied in the library for six 
hours.

817
00:41:29,861 --> 00:41:33,990
Like no you did you study for half an 
hour coffee

818
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,460
and you look through facebook and I went
home and you said,

819
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,530
well I studied for six hours and you're 
happy about it,

820
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:42,560
but you don't bloody well you did part 
because you can't,

821
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:43,783
you know,
I can only read for about three and a 

822
00:41:44,631 --> 00:41:47,300
half hours until I'm done and I'm pretty
good at it.

823
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:51,320
So these people who are running things,
there's corrupt people obviously,

824
00:41:51,321 --> 00:41:54,240
but the vast majority of them first are 
self made.

825
00:41:54,241 --> 00:41:57,080
Its second.
They're so bloody efficient and smart.

826
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,800
You cannot believe it.
And they work 80 hours a week at.

827
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:03,620
Most of them happened to be mad.
And why is that?

828
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,573
Because there are a small number of 
insane men who will do nothing but work 

829
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,960
80 hours a week and no matter where you 
put them,

830
00:42:11,961 --> 00:42:12,794
if you put them in the middle of a 
forest with an ax and all they would do 

831
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:16,760
is run around chopping down trees.

832
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:22,190
So the issue isn't why aren't there more
women in positions of power?

833
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:27,110
It's why are there any men insane enough
ever to occupy those positions?

834
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,103
You know,
because we also know and the data on 

835
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:31,274
this,
it's very clear what's the relationship 

836
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:36,680
between money.
It will be once you have enough money to

837
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:37,514
keep the bill collectors from your door.
So once you have enough money to stave 

838
00:42:41,331 --> 00:42:44,390
off misery,
which is sort of lower middle class,

839
00:42:44,391 --> 00:42:47,360
something like that in our society,
maybe a little little lower than that.

840
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:51,890
Extra money does not help you.
It does not improve your life.

841
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,810
So why bother with it?
Well,

842
00:42:53,811 --> 00:42:55,760
that's what the women in the law firms 
think.

843
00:42:55,761 --> 00:42:58,550
It's like most of them,
by the time they're in their thirties,

844
00:42:58,551 --> 00:42:59,384
are married.
Almost all of them are married to men 

845
00:43:01,461 --> 00:43:02,294
who make as much money or more than they
do because that's what women go for 

846
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:08,810
cross culturally four to five years 
older,

847
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:12,710
equal or higher in socioeconomic status,
so their.

848
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:16,490
Their husband's already made $350,000 a 
year.

849
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:17,810
It's like they think,
well,

850
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:18,853
I don't need much more money.
The man used money to keep track of the 

851
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:22,184
competition by the way,
because all the male lawyers that I 

852
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:25,244
talked to,
her usually real hard ass guys really 

853
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:28,940
low in agreeableness,
really high in conscientiousness,

854
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:32,630
like conservative types,
low in openness as well and they want to

855
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:33,464
win and the reason they care about your 
damn bonus at the end of the year isn't 

856
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:37,124
even so much because of the money.
It's because they got a much bigger 

857
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:40,334
bonus than the other son of a bitch 
sitting beside them and they're happy 

858
00:43:42,531 --> 00:43:44,600
about that.
So there's a real,

859
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:48,920
like a real brass knuckles competition 
that drives these sorts of things,

860
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:52,060
but we get things backwards so often in,
in,

861
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:52,963
in psychology and in sociology.
It's not why there aren't more women in 

862
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:56,960
positions of power.

863
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,810
It's whiting.
Any men want those positions,

864
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:00,973
you just have no idea the amount of 
responsibility that comes along with 

865
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:04,184
that.
You just imagine for a minute trying to 

866
00:44:05,491 --> 00:44:09,380
run a billion dollar corporation.
You can't even bloody well balanced your

867
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:12,320
checkbook and there's dust bunnies 
underneath your bed.

868
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,080
How in the world would you ever run a 
billion dollar corporation?

869
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:15,943
Those things are complicated and you 
have enemies and they're trying to take 

870
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:22,500
you out all the time.
You look at apple and Samsung,

871
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:24,080
man,
they're just torturing each other in the

872
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:25,750
courts nonstop.
You know,

873
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,780
you'll,
if you're,

874
00:44:26,781 --> 00:44:28,700
if you're running a big corporation,
you'll be.

875
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,820
You'll be handling two or 300 lawsuits a
time and that's just,

876
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:33,683
that's just nothing compared to the 
complexity of what you actually have to 

877
00:44:36,571 --> 00:44:39,000
do.
Stay on top of the technology,

878
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:41,820
constantly interact with your large 
customers.

879
00:44:41,821 --> 00:44:45,870
Travel all the time because you have to 
maintain the relationships.

880
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,620
You have to regulate the politics inside
the business.

881
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,740
You have,
believe me,

882
00:44:52,741 --> 00:44:54,420
it's no picnic and you think,
well,

883
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:55,680
they get a lot of money.
It's like,

884
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:57,840
what makes you think that's such a good 
thing?

885
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:00,720
You know,
like if you're a half crazy and you have

886
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:02,850
a lot of money,
you're going to be crazy a lot faster,

887
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:07,470
I can tell you that frees you from all 
sorts of constraints.

888
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:09,870
You know,
we know the data on lottery winners,

889
00:45:09,871 --> 00:45:12,540
they're no happier a year later and some
of them are done,

890
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:13,733
especially if they had like a bit of a 
cocaine problem to begin with because 

891
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,610
you know,
being broke stops you from dying.

892
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:20,463
If you're a cocaine addict,
if you get enough money and the way you 

893
00:45:22,201 --> 00:45:24,240
go and you think to yourself,
you know,

894
00:45:24,241 --> 00:45:26,520
you've got all sorts of bad habits,
weirdnesses.

895
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,010
If somebody dumped an infinite amount of
money on you,

896
00:45:29,011 --> 00:45:31,650
what makes you think you would unravel 
completely?

897
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:35,140
It's highly probable.
So anyway,

898
00:45:35,141 --> 00:45:38,750
so back to these women,
you know what they do in their thirties,

899
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:39,603
they look around and they played hit 
partner so they hit the pinnacle of 

900
00:45:41,941 --> 00:45:43,380
their profession.
They think,

901
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:44,783
what the hell am I doing this for?
Why would anyone in their right mind 

902
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:49,060
want to be woken up at three in the 
morning,

903
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:53,460
Sunday by they're irate Japanese client 
who wants them to work for the next five

904
00:45:53,461 --> 00:45:58,461
hours nonstop to fix this damn problem,
which is going to cost them $100,000,000

905
00:45:58,650 --> 00:45:59,483
right now,
or we'll find someone else to pay $750 

906
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:06,000
an hour or two to fix it right now.
When you think,

907
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:06,540
well,
that's,

908
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,000
you know,
a masculine form of value that.

909
00:46:09,001 --> 00:46:09,834
Because that's one of the criticisms.
If the law firms just adopted a more 

910
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:13,704
feminine structure of value,
it's like what kind of bullshit is and 

911
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:18,120
the reason,
the reason that you get up,

912
00:46:18,121 --> 00:46:18,954
it's three in the morning on Sunday to 
talk to your Japanese client was 

913
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:22,643
freaking out about their contract is 
because if you don't jump the hell up 

914
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:25,824
and do it right now,
there's some starving associate who's 

915
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,273
unbelievably ambitious in New York will 
pick up the pieces and two tenths of a 

916
00:46:32,881 --> 00:46:36,090
second and they're smart and aggressive 
and they'll take you out.

917
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:41,160
So it has nothing to do with masculine 
structures of values.

918
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:43,690
All the foolish ideas.
And you know,

919
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,810
it's not just law where this happens,
you know,

920
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:48,840
we know for example,
that female doctors were far fewer hours

921
00:46:48,841 --> 00:46:50,910
too.
So the more female doctors you have,

922
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:51,803
the more doctors you have to have.
And I'm not complaining about women's 

923
00:46:54,991 --> 00:46:58,860
priorities.
I'm not saying that women are wrong.

924
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,590
Not at all.
It's like the older I get,

925
00:47:01,591 --> 00:47:05,790
the more I understand that marriage and 
family are a primary importance.

926
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:08,530
And the more I see women in particular,
no,

927
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,850
they hit 35 or 40 and they're not 
married,

928
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:11,693
they don't have kids and they are not 
happy because what the hell are you 

929
00:47:14,341 --> 00:47:16,890
going to do from the time you're 40 till
the time you're 80,

930
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,340
you've got no family,
you got no relationships.

931
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:23,070
What are you going to do?
Go Run your company.

932
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:27,140
Yeah.
Well if you're one in a thousand that'll

933
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:30,520
satisfy.
So you well better make sure you're that

934
00:47:30,521 --> 00:47:34,150
one in a thousand and you're probably 
not because those people are rare.

935
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:35,750
So.
So,

936
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,870
so then,
uh,

937
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:40,630
Dr Peterson one of the natural response 
to what you said,

938
00:47:40,631 --> 00:47:41,740
would it be okay?
Well,

939
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:43,173
the priorities are,
it's a rigged game because only when 

940
00:47:45,521 --> 00:47:46,900
there are the ones who are able to 
procreate.

941
00:47:46,901 --> 00:47:49,390
So what do we answer to that?
Of course it's a rigged game.

942
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,733
Obviously it's a rate game.
Women have complicated lives and the 

943
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:55,780
pill has made them more complicated.
Well that's not.

944
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,540
I wouldn't say that exactly because you 
know,

945
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,550
100 years in 18,
95,

946
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:04,360
the average person in the western world 
lived on $1 a day in today's money.

947
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:07,300
Okay?
So those people worked so hard at slaved

948
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:10,720
away to such a degree that you can't 
even imagine it and all their kids die.

949
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,490
Right?
So they,

950
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:17,170
that the death rate among kids below 
five years beyond comprehension.

951
00:48:17,171 --> 00:48:19,720
And so like women have terrible time as 
well.

952
00:48:19,721 --> 00:48:20,554
So did men.
They got to be coal miners and soldiers 

953
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,520
because now that wasn't exactly 
entertaining,

954
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:26,980
you know?
So life was very,

955
00:48:26,981 --> 00:48:27,760
very,
very,

956
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,593
very,
very hard before we got rich and we're 

957
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,620
rich.
Even those of you who are in this class,

958
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:33,880
we think you're poor.
It's like,

959
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,260
no,
you're not,

960
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,770
you're in the top one 10th of one 
percent by historical standards.

961
00:48:38,771 --> 00:48:42,070
And probably there by world standards as
well.

962
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:43,143
Of course you can just compare yourself 
to the few people who Richard than you 

963
00:48:45,191 --> 00:48:46,024
and feel sorry for yourself.
But that's pretty pathetic in my 

964
00:48:48,311 --> 00:48:49,144
estimation.
So it's ended certainly historically 

965
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:53,830
uninformed.
So yeah,

966
00:48:53,831 --> 00:48:56,830
women have it rough obviously.
Now there's,

967
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,860
there's other things to consider.
You do live eight years longer,

968
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:02,080
so that's not trivial.

969
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:05,680
Testosterone kills men.
That's basically why men die earlier.

970
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,120
You know,
men are much more likely to be killed in

971
00:49:08,121 --> 00:49:10,630
dangerous jobs.
They do almost all the dangerous jobs.

972
00:49:10,631 --> 00:49:11,464
They do almost all the outside work and 
there's lots of reasons that men get 

973
00:49:14,801 --> 00:49:17,470
paid more than women that have nothing 
to do with the prejudice.

974
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,693
It's because they take awful,
horrible jobs like working in the oil 

975
00:49:21,221 --> 00:49:25,130
rigs in northern Alberta,
but it's bloody 40 below and come out of

976
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,920
that after five years with two or three 
fingers missing and,

977
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:28,873
and all warped up because you really 
want to wrestle pipe when it's 40 below 

978
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:37,570
and it's filthy with a bunch of ordinary
man who are hung over beyond belief.

979
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,010
It's like that's not very entertaining.
So yeah,

980
00:49:42,011 --> 00:49:42,844
I mean each gender,
each sex has its own unfairness to deal 

981
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:48,880
with,
but to think of that as a consequence of

982
00:49:48,881 --> 00:49:50,230
the social structure,
it's like,

983
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,790
come on,
really,

984
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:54,130
what about nature itself?

985
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:55,623
And this is something,
this is something that seems to be 

986
00:49:57,401 --> 00:50:00,520
completely invisible on the left side of
the political spectrum.

987
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:01,863
It's like,
of course you're bloody oppressed and 

988
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:05,380
your life is full of suffering 
obviously,

989
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,633
but to think about that as a direct 
consequence of unjust social structures 

990
00:50:09,341 --> 00:50:10,174
is just moronic.
It's like that's part of the reason a 

991
00:50:12,281 --> 00:50:15,250
small part,
but look where you're sitting people,

992
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,120
it's pretty warm in here and you're so 
privileged.

993
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:21,850
You can come here at Saturday morning 
and listen to an intellectual lecture.

994
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,013
It's like you should be happy about that
because by historical standards you 

995
00:50:25,511 --> 00:50:30,511
should be out lifting rocks in your 
skeletal form about five foot three with

996
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:34,670
no teeth.
Cougars,

997
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:36,920
cougars alliance.
Yeah,

998
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:38,300
exactly.
So you know,

999
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,490
there's no gratitude.
That's the thing.

1000
00:50:40,491 --> 00:50:43,340
There's no gratitude for what our 
society is capable of doing.

1001
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,800
So a three.

1002
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:47,650
Yeah,
Dr Peterson.

1003
00:50:47,651 --> 00:50:51,220
Tell them what do you think about that?
Because I was thinking what happens when

1004
00:50:51,221 --> 00:50:56,160
the forces of the gender identity,
gender expression clash with the Marx,

1005
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:58,780
the capitalist market forces,
for example,

1006
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:00,003
sports is a multibillion dollar industry
and if some women start saying we 

1007
00:51:03,581 --> 00:51:07,720
express ourselves as bad because we're 
mad and the law is on their side.

1008
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:08,763
Do you think that this billion dollar 
industry is going to come out with some 

1009
00:51:12,161 --> 00:51:16,150
women wanting to be football teams on 
the Toronto Maple leafs?

1010
00:51:16,151 --> 00:51:17,030
I don't think so.
Sad.

1011
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:17,883
Whenever you do of the market forces 
will will clash with this and then some 

1012
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,433
of these issues.

1013
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,053
Well,
market forces will be a constraining 

1014
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,353
factor.
Partly because the market tends to 

1015
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:37,570
punish things that don't work in the 
market very,

1016
00:51:37,571 --> 00:51:38,890
very rapidly.
You know,

1017
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:43,030
and that's another thing with regards to
thinking about say equality or equity in

1018
00:51:43,031 --> 00:51:43,864
the workplace.
If you believe that there is a 

1019
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:52,480
equivalent distribution of talent across
all the categories,

1020
00:51:52,481 --> 00:51:53,314
that you have some reason to wait for 
the market to sort itself out because 

1021
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:59,650
you know,
even if you're a,

1022
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:03,520
an anticapitalist,
you at least have to understand that the

1023
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:06,340
people that you despise are motivated by
greed.

1024
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,780
And so they're going to try to find 
people who will make them the most money

1025
00:52:10,781 --> 00:52:11,614
and they basically do that.
It's a pretty stupid employer who won't 

1026
00:52:14,081 --> 00:52:16,360
take someone tell them to when they come
along and you might say,

1027
00:52:16,361 --> 00:52:18,250
well,
they're prejudiced and they're not doing

1028
00:52:18,251 --> 00:52:21,160
such a great job of,
of like sorting out the applicants.

1029
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,080
It's like,
that's fine.

1030
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:22,923
There'll be stomped real good by people 
who are much better at it because like 

1031
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:26,873
talent is unbelievably rare.
I don't know if you guys have talked 

1032
00:52:28,661 --> 00:52:31,450
about the freedom distribution at all,
but.

1033
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:32,583
Well,
productivity is not normally 

1034
00:52:34,271 --> 00:52:36,880
distributed.
You don't even learned psychology.

1035
00:52:36,881 --> 00:52:38,440
That's everything is normally 
distributed.

1036
00:52:38,441 --> 00:52:38,851
It's like,
no,

1037
00:52:38,851 --> 00:52:42,040
it's not
random.

1038
00:52:42,041 --> 00:52:45,610
Things are normally distributed,
but productivity isn't random.

1039
00:52:45,611 --> 00:52:46,444
And so what you see that productivity is
actually governed by something called 

1040
00:52:49,031 --> 00:52:49,864
price's law,
which is a variation of another 

1041
00:52:51,551 --> 00:52:54,850
principle called the preto principle,
which was discovered back in the late 18

1042
00:52:54,851 --> 00:52:57,700
hundreds by deal Fredel Pareto who was 
an economist.

1043
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:02,380
What price showed he price actually 
studying scientific productivity.

1044
00:53:02,381 --> 00:53:04,390
And so what he shows,
it's quite cool.

1045
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:07,480
At the time when he did this,
this was in 1960,

1046
00:53:07,481 --> 00:53:11,470
the typical phd student had one 
publication on graduation,

1047
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:13,630
okay,
half as many had two,

1048
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:14,763
half as many as that had three,
half as many as that had a massive step 

1049
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:20,474
down in productivity and you see this in
beside in scientific productivity 

1050
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:24,334
periods,
so what happens that in any given 

1051
00:53:26,101 --> 00:53:29,430
scientific domain,
there's a clump of people sort of on the

1052
00:53:29,431 --> 00:53:30,264
left side of the distribution,
the less productive side and there have 

1053
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,500
an in that clump.

1054
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,393
Men and women are equally productive,
but then there's a tiny percentage of 

1055
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:43,881
people who publish all the papers and 
they're all men and they're those insane

1056
00:53:44,011 --> 00:53:47,130
man that I was telling you about before 
that do not work for 80,

1057
00:53:47,131 --> 00:53:49,110
almost a week.
And the thing is,

1058
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:51,080
if you want to rise to the top of a 
profession,

1059
00:53:51,081 --> 00:53:53,510
do you think about it?
What do you need to rise to the top of a

1060
00:53:53,511 --> 00:53:57,060
competitive profession?
You better be smart cars,

1061
00:53:57,061 --> 00:53:57,894
smart makes you fast and you're not 
going to get to the next place faster 

1062
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:02,880
than anyone else.
Unless you're faster than them.

1063
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,270
You bloody well better be conscientious,
industrious in particular,

1064
00:54:06,271 --> 00:54:07,104
so it should make you feel horrible 
every second of your life you spent 

1065
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:11,993
doing something that involves leisure 
and there's going to be some people in 

1066
00:54:14,371 --> 00:54:16,560
here that know that Mr hyperconscious 
branches,

1067
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:18,450
I can't stand sitting around doing 
nothing.

1068
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:20,380
I got to find some art to it.
You know,

1069
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:21,243
when you'll do whatever you have to 
that's work because you feel guilty and 

1070
00:54:24,001 --> 00:54:24,834
horrible if you're sitting around.
So you need to be hyper conscientious 

1071
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,673
and so maybe you need to be in the top 
one percent for intelligence and maybe 

1072
00:54:32,401 --> 00:54:34,350
the top five percent for 
industriousness.

1073
00:54:34,351 --> 00:54:37,800
So that's one percent of five percent.
So you're looking at it.

1074
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,400
I think that's one of that.
What is that one percent?

1075
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:41,820
Five percent?
Yeah.

1076
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,820
One in 100.
One in 20.

1077
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:46,500
One in $2,000.
I think that's right.

1078
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,280
Anyways,
you're a rare bird if you're going to be

1079
00:54:50,281 --> 00:54:52,320
in that position.
And so,

1080
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:53,783
um,
because because of the credo 

1081
00:54:56,011 --> 00:54:56,844
distribution and because of the 
concentration of productivity in a very 

1082
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:02,760
small number of people,
there's tremendous economic incentive to

1083
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:05,190
identify those people no matter where 
they're from.

1084
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,053
No matter who they are and employers who
have any sense know that and they're 

1085
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,820
hungry like these law firms,
you know,

1086
00:55:11,821 --> 00:55:12,654
you don't have no idea that knots,
they tie themselves in trying to keep 

1087
00:55:15,661 --> 00:55:19,320
their qualified women because those 
women are worth a bloody fortune.

1088
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:20,550
You know,
they pay them a lot,

1089
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:22,680
but they bring in way more business 
than,

1090
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:27,060
than they bring in far more economic 
resources.

1091
00:55:27,061 --> 00:55:29,190
Then they take the law.
Firms want to keep them.

1092
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:30,203
Now that doesn't mean the man,
all the men in the law firms don't have 

1093
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,073
no problems with highly qualified women 
because they don't know what to do with 

1094
00:55:37,381 --> 00:55:38,370
them.
You know,

1095
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:42,360
like if you're a guy and you're 
assertive and competitive,

1096
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,553
then you're going to be asserting 
yourself and competitive with other 

1097
00:55:45,061 --> 00:55:45,894
guys.
But it's a lot harder to do that with a 

1098
00:55:47,071 --> 00:55:48,450
woman because you think,
well,

1099
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:50,160
what am I?
How am I going to be?

1100
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,413
Am I going to be like hyper aggressive 
around her because that just doesn't 

1101
00:55:54,361 --> 00:55:55,800
work out.
And so the guys,

1102
00:55:55,801 --> 00:55:56,634
we don't know what to do about that.
And I would say there's some residual 

1103
00:55:59,221 --> 00:56:02,580
trouble in law firms and other high end 
industries because of that.

1104
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:06,120
They just don't know how to sort it out.
But mostly the employers are thinking,

1105
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,253
I don't care if you're green,
if you're a smart and you can bring in 

1106
00:56:10,351 --> 00:56:11,184
business and you're reliable and you can
solve problems like we don't have 

1107
00:56:14,161 --> 00:56:15,750
anybody like you,
we need you,

1108
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,240
please stay.
Doesn't happen.

1109
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:21,000
So yes,
the market forces will.

1110
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:21,943
But the market forces I think are 
already going push things hard and then 

1111
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:25,743
in the direction of maximizing the 
utility of television because you just 

1112
00:56:30,131 --> 00:56:32,830
have no idea how much more productive a 
productive person is.

1113
00:56:32,831 --> 00:56:35,350
Then a nonproductive person.
It's crazy.

1114
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:39,830
It's crazy.
I just to that a publication which is to

1115
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:41,280
get your blood boiling.
Yes.

1116
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,970
Somebody said to me,
glaciers,

1117
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:44,863
gender and science,
a feminist glaciology framework for 

1118
00:56:47,231 --> 00:56:51,160
global environmental change research.
You want to talk about productivity.

1119
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:55,660
And then there's academia
that degree all of academia.

1120
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,730
But unfortunately,
I mean this is a profession in which,

1121
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:58,773
uh,
people have killed them truly in the 

1122
00:57:00,771 --> 00:57:05,771
trees for bullshit basically.
So I just thought that would be ironic.

1123
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:07,010
Twist,
yeah,

1124
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:09,070
well you know the postmodernists,
they don't believe in.

1125
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:12,340
I don't know how much you know about 
postmodern philosophy.

1126
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,620
You're at Ryerson,
so probably quite advanced,

1127
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:18,400
but not at the uft is any better because
it's not,

1128
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,310
but the postmodern is don't believe it's
science.

1129
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:22,323
There's lots of things they don't 
believe and they don't believe in logic 

1130
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:27,160
and I'm not making this stuff up.
Like you can go read it for yourself.

1131
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:28,473
In particular,
they think that logic is part of the 

1132
00:57:29,891 --> 00:57:30,724
oppressive patriarchy and that there's 
no point in dialogue because all the 

1133
00:57:33,071 --> 00:57:33,904
reasons different power groups 
identified by their groups and they 

1134
00:57:35,891 --> 00:57:36,724
can't really talk.
It's just a power struggle and that's 

1135
00:57:39,011 --> 00:57:42,040
why the radical leftist stop people from
speaking on campus.

1136
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:43,443
That's why I couldn't find anybody to 
debate me rough and speaking at the 

1137
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:47,523
University of Toronto and I went to 
Queens University two weeks ago to the 

1138
00:57:49,391 --> 00:57:50,224
law school there because I was invited 
by a group called Runnymede Association 

1139
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:55,240
and they asked six professors if they 
would debate me.

1140
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:56,223
It's like,
no,

1141
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,273
why not?
I'm not even a lawyer and lawyers can 

1142
00:57:59,081 --> 00:58:00,850
debate like they're.
They're good at that.

1143
00:58:00,851 --> 00:58:02,440
That's what they're trained to do.
No,

1144
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:03,274
they wouldn't debate me,
so they had to get somebody to play 

1145
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:07,450
devil's advocate and he did a good job.
You know,

1146
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:09,190
he did a very credible job,
I thought,

1147
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,080
but you think,
well,

1148
00:58:11,081 --> 00:58:13,420
why would they come debate me?
That's easy.

1149
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:16,660
They don't believe in dialogue,
period.

1150
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,050
It's part of the philosophy because you 
have to believe in logic.

1151
00:58:20,051 --> 00:58:21,730
First of all,
to believe in dialogue.

1152
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:22,683
You have to believe that people can 
communicate as like as individuals 

1153
00:58:25,331 --> 00:58:26,164
fundamentally and not that you're just 
locked in your identity as a group 

1154
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:30,214
member against all the other identity 
groups that are struggling for power in 

1155
00:58:33,701 --> 00:58:37,720
the Kinda hobsy and landscape that's all
part of postmodernism.

1156
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:39,870
So and this,
well,

1157
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:43,450
this is just an extension of that.
It's like science is just a patriarchal,

1158
00:58:43,451 --> 00:58:44,284
oppressive,
patriarchal structure and so we need to 

1159
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:49,660
reconstitute it from.
It's from the bottom up.

1160
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,680
It's like they type on their computers 
while they say this.

1161
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:57,910
Not noticing that by the fact that 
they're using the damn computer,

1162
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:59,770
which wouldn't work.
You know?

1163
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:01,023
People had to figure out quantum 
mechanics before they could make 

1164
00:59:02,921 --> 00:59:06,430
community computers.
They use the computer science,

1165
00:59:06,431 --> 00:59:08,110
doesn't.
Science isn't real.

1166
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,490
They do the same thing when they're in 
jet planes.

1167
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:17,580
Science isn't real 600 miles an hour 
typing on my computer so I could six.

1168
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:19,383
That's called a performative 
contradiction from a philosophical 

1169
00:59:21,921 --> 00:59:25,190
perspective and that's the same as a as 
a logical paradox.

1170
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:29,440
You don't get to say one thing and do 
another and say that you've got it while

1171
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:30,463
you do,
if you're a postmodernist because you 

1172
00:59:31,251 --> 00:59:32,084
can do whatever you want if you're a 
postmodernist and the reason the damn 

1173
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,100
postmodernists are Marxists as far as I 
can tell,

1174
00:59:37,101 --> 00:59:37,934
because inevitably they are,
is because the problem with 

1175
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:41,144
postmodernism is it doesn't even leave 
postmodernists anything to do because 

1176
00:59:45,471 --> 00:59:49,250
postmodernists don't believe in 
overarching directional narratives.

1177
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:50,383
And the problem with that proposition is
if you don't have an overarching 

1178
00:59:53,451 --> 00:59:54,284
directive narrative for your life,
you don't know what to do and it's 

1179
00:59:57,411 --> 00:59:59,760
really important that you know what to 
do because you're alive,

1180
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:00,623
that you need to do things well.
We'll just turn back to the original 

1181
01:00:03,411 --> 01:00:04,640
Marxism and we'll say,
well,

1182
01:00:04,641 --> 01:00:05,474
we'll just get.
We'll just group ourselves up in 

1183
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:07,523
oppressed groups and we'll have wars 
between the oppressed groups that'll 

1184
01:00:10,011 --> 01:00:12,710
give us a sufficient overarching 
narrative.

1185
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:14,083
Doesn't matter that it contradicts the 
postmodernist thesis because they don't 

1186
01:00:16,401 --> 01:00:19,880
care about contradictions so.
Well.

1187
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:24,890
So hence this feminist glaciology.
Okay.

1188
01:00:24,891 --> 01:00:26,990
So I've got a few questions.
Let me watch your hands pop up.

1189
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:28,090
So there's one back that first

1190
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:35,890
you've
been determined as

1191
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:54,030
women
and

1192
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,380
gender choice or not choice?

1193
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:08,150
It's a good.
It's a good question.

1194
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,530
No,
I don't think so.

1195
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:12,350
Even though I think your question is 
well formulated,

1196
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:13,184
that intelligent,
I don't think it's that the economy is 

1197
01:01:15,561 --> 01:01:16,394
that straightforward because there's a 
tremendous amount of deterministic 

1198
01:01:19,431 --> 01:01:20,264
thinking on the social justice warrior 
in the distribution to because they 

1199
01:01:23,511 --> 01:01:26,840
regard you as the deterministic product 
of your environment.

1200
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,170
So it's more like the localization of 
determinism.

1201
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:31,543
So you might say that for the dialogue 
for the more biologically oriented 

1202
01:01:34,671 --> 01:01:35,504
people,
there's more biological determinism but 

1203
01:01:37,071 --> 01:01:39,280
then so,
so I think that the,

1204
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,133
the,
the conflict between free will and 

1205
01:01:41,421 --> 01:01:44,360
determinism basically runs across the 
entire political spectrum.

1206
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:45,643
But then I would also say it's probably 
an ill formed argument because there 

1207
01:01:50,811 --> 01:01:51,644
isn't an absolute paradoxical 
contradiction between free will and 

1208
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:57,800
determinism.
Quite the contrary.

1209
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:59,930
You actually need elements of 
determinism,

1210
01:01:59,931 --> 01:02:02,120
I think for a system to operate freely.

1211
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:05,180
So for example,
think about playing chess.

1212
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,033
You can do a lot of things when you're 
playing chess or think about composing 

1213
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,273
music.
You can do a lot of things when you're 

1214
01:02:11,571 --> 01:02:14,360
composing music,
but there's an underlying rule structure

1215
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:16,880
that sets up the,
the,

1216
01:02:16,881 --> 01:02:17,714
uh,
the environment within which all of 

1217
01:02:19,441 --> 01:02:22,980
those choices manifest themselves.
The same with online video games,

1218
01:02:22,981 --> 01:02:23,700
which,
which,

1219
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,533
which are reading good example,
I think because they are micro worlds 

1220
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:28,283
and they're determined in some sense 
because they have an underlying rule 

1221
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:34,680
structure that's the rules of the game,
but they're free in many other ways.

1222
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:40,070
And so I don't think there's anybody 
pretty much on any side of the political

1223
01:02:40,351 --> 01:02:44,550
spectrum who would regard people as 
entirely possessed a freewill.

1224
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,740
You know,
we have constraints and limits and the,

1225
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:50,160
we're also pretty good at adjusting 
those on the fly.

1226
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:51,483
So for example,
you'll be much less irritated if at 

1227
01:02:53,701 --> 01:02:57,960
three year old runs into you carelessly,
well tryciclics than you will if a,

1228
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,033
you know,
an adult man runs into with his scooter 

1229
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,130
because you'll,
you'll take,

1230
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:06,150
you'll take the constraints of the 
individual into account very,

1231
01:03:06,151 --> 01:03:09,300
very rapidly.
So I think so.

1232
01:03:09,301 --> 01:03:10,134
Well,
so that's,

1233
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:13,670
it's not as simple as free will versus 
determinism mount onto the political.

1234
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:27,680
You mentioned that somebody thought that
socialism was

1235
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:36,210
a,
there's a,

1236
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:42,150
there's something wrong with that person
and see what you're saying.

1237
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:43,433
I wonder.
I asked her to say those are the video 

1238
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:48,070
about compassion,
about how people get their compassion,

1239
01:03:48,071 --> 01:03:52,430
altruism and that you appeal to an 
individual.

1240
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:57,110
It seems that like attacking that,
that's not your peer,

1241
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,210
but it seems that even get people on 
their heels sort of,

1242
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:04,150
you know,
I see like some hatred for Americans

1243
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:06,483
or Muslims and,
and I think that just makes people they 

1244
01:04:08,461 --> 01:04:11,000
naturally feel identified with like 
their land,

1245
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:11,883
their category.
It'll just make them defend that stance 

1246
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:19,850
even more reaching for the individual,
like understanding compassionate.

1247
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,073
Okay.
So I take that apart a little bit 

1248
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,410
because is a bunch of issues with the 
question,

1249
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:29,013
how many people are in your psychology 
course or taking psychology or most of 

1250
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:32,434
you taking psychology courses,
how many people are taking psychology 

1251
01:04:34,391 --> 01:04:35,500
courses?
Okay,

1252
01:04:35,501 --> 01:04:37,300
so a goodly number.
Well,

1253
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,580
one of the things you want to do with 
the conception,

1254
01:04:39,581 --> 01:04:40,414
like compassionate as you actually want 
to start thinking about it like a 

1255
01:04:42,971 --> 01:04:47,070
psychologist or like a scientist,
because compassion is actually definable

1256
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:48,563
and it.
I think the easiest way to approach it 

1257
01:04:50,741 --> 01:04:52,810
is to think about it in big five terms 
because it.

1258
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:53,723
It maps onto agreeableness and 
especially you can break agreeableness 

1259
01:04:57,641 --> 01:05:01,120
down into compassion and politeness and 
the liberal types,

1260
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:04,250
especially the social justice types are 
way higher in compassion.

1261
01:05:04,251 --> 01:05:07,060
It's actually their,
their fundamental characteristic and you

1262
01:05:07,061 --> 01:05:07,810
might think,
well,

1263
01:05:07,810 --> 01:05:09,340
compassion is,
is a virtue.

1264
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:10,420
It's like,
yes,

1265
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,750
it is average you,
but any unit,

1266
01:05:13,751 --> 01:05:14,584
dimensional virtue immediately becomes a
vice because real is the intermingling 

1267
01:05:18,701 --> 01:05:19,534
of a number of virtues and their and 
their integration into a functional 

1268
01:05:23,831 --> 01:05:27,430
identity that can be expressed socially 
and compassion.

1269
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:33,160
Passion is great if you happen to be the
entity towards which it is directive,

1270
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:34,383
but compassion tends to divide the world
into a crying children and predatory 

1271
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:40,990
snakes.
Right?

1272
01:05:40,991 --> 01:05:42,730
And so if you're a crying child,
hey,

1273
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:43,564
great man,
but if you happen to be identified as 

1274
01:05:45,611 --> 01:05:48,520
one of the predatory snakes,
you better look the hell out.

1275
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:50,860
And so,
you know,

1276
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,400
compassionate is what the mother,
grizzly bear feels for her cubs when she

1277
01:05:54,401 --> 01:05:57,460
eats you because you got in the way,
right?

1278
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:58,390
Exactly.
So,

1279
01:05:58,420 --> 01:05:59,253
nope,
we don't want to be thinking for a 

1280
01:05:59,981 --> 01:06:02,920
second that compassion isn't a,
uh,

1281
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:06,760
a virtue that could lead to violence 
because it certainly can.

1282
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:11,380
And the other problem with compassion,
this is why we have conscientiousness,

1283
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:12,873
right?
There's five canonical personality 

1284
01:06:14,381 --> 01:06:15,214
dimensions.
Agreeableness is pretty good if you're 

1285
01:06:16,751 --> 01:06:17,584
dealing and getting akin system,
you want to distribute resources 

1286
01:06:21,221 --> 01:06:22,120
equally,
for example,

1287
01:06:22,121 --> 01:06:24,520
among your children,
because you want all of them to have not

1288
01:06:24,521 --> 01:06:27,730
only the same chance you even walk them 
roughly to have the same outcome,

1289
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:29,860
a good one,
but the problem is,

1290
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:34,861
is you can't extend that moral network 
to larger groups.

1291
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:37,180
Not as far as I can tell you need 
conscientiousness,

1292
01:06:37,181 --> 01:06:42,130
which is a much colder virtue and it's 
also a virtue that's much more concerned

1293
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:45,940
with larger structures over the longer 
period of time.

1294
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:47,793
So and you can take about 
conscientiousness is a form of 

1295
01:06:50,291 --> 01:06:52,000
compassion to.
It's a strange form.

1296
01:06:52,001 --> 01:06:55,300
It's like straighten the hell up and 
work hard and your life will go well.

1297
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:57,430
It's like I don't care how your 
feelings,

1298
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,353
how you feel about that right now.
And and like someone who's cold low in 

1299
01:07:02,471 --> 01:07:04,810
agreeableness say and high in 
conscientiousness,

1300
01:07:04,811 --> 01:07:06,550
that's what they'll tell you every time.
Don't,

1301
01:07:06,551 --> 01:07:09,190
don't come whining to me.
I don't care about your feelings.

1302
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:11,650
Do Your Goddamn job.
Are you going to be out on the street?

1303
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:12,933
Think,
oh that person's being really hard on 

1304
01:07:13,871 --> 01:07:15,250
me.
It's like not necessarily.

1305
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:19,420
They might have your long term best 
interest in mind and you're fortunate if

1306
01:07:19,421 --> 01:07:20,254
you come across someone who's like not 
too radically disagreeable but 

1307
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,113
moderately disagreeable and high in 
conscientiousness because the whip you 

1308
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:28,294
into shape.

1309
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:31,660
And that's really helpful.
I mean you,

1310
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:34,210
you'll admire people like that.
You won't be able to help it,

1311
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:35,021
you know?
And you think,

1312
01:07:35,021 --> 01:07:35,854
Oh wow,
this person's actually giving me good 

1313
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:38,013
information even though you know,
you feel like a slug after you after 

1314
01:07:41,261 --> 01:07:44,560
they've taken you apart.
So okay,

1315
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:45,394
so that's the compassion issue.
It's like you can't just transform that 

1316
01:07:47,501 --> 01:07:48,334
into a political stance and I think part
of what we're seeing is actually the 

1317
01:07:51,881 --> 01:07:54,370
rise of a form of female 
totalitarianism.

1318
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:55,603
So we have no idea what totalitarianism 
would be like if women read because 

1319
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:02,440
that's never happened before in the 
history of the planet.

1320
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:07,750
And so we've introduced women into the 
political sphere radically over the last

1321
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:08,584
50 years.
We have no idea what the consequence of 

1322
01:08:10,371 --> 01:08:12,910
that is going to be,
but we do know from our research,

1323
01:08:12,911 --> 01:08:13,744
which is preliminary,
that agreeableness really predicts 

1324
01:08:16,851 --> 01:08:17,684
political correctness,
but female gender predicts over and 

1325
01:08:20,511 --> 01:08:22,070
above the personality trait.

1326
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:24,620
And that's something we found very 
rarely in our research.

1327
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:28,490
Usually the sex differences are wiped 
out by the personality differences,

1328
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,970
but not in this particular case.
And then,

1329
01:08:30,971 --> 01:08:31,804
you know,
women are getting married later and 

1330
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:36,530
they're having children much later and 
they're having fewer of them.

1331
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:41,770
And so you also have to wonder what 
their feminine orientation is doing with

1332
01:08:41,961 --> 01:08:42,794
itself in the interim,
roughly speaking and lot of it's being 

1333
01:08:46,791 --> 01:08:49,460
expressed as political opinion,
like in fair enough.

1334
01:08:49,461 --> 01:08:50,400
You know,
that's,

1335
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:54,080
that's fine,
but it's not fine when it starts to shut

1336
01:08:54,081 --> 01:08:57,830
down discussion.
But also if you think about politics,

1337
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:59,740
politics from a temperamental 
perspective,

1338
01:08:59,741 --> 01:09:03,530
if it gets to be extraordinarily useful.
So if you have conservative,

1339
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:04,873
you're high in conscientiousness,
particularly orderliness and you're low 

1340
01:09:08,151 --> 01:09:09,740
in openness.
Okay,

1341
01:09:09,741 --> 01:09:11,750
so what good are you?
Well,

1342
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:12,763
you're not great.
If you had to have a wonderful 

1343
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:17,390
philosophical conversation about ideas 
and then go ahead and art movie.

1344
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:20,150
It's like no conservatives,
you're wrong.

1345
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:23,990
Wrong date for that particular bit of 
business.

1346
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:25,183
But if you want someone to run a company
that's already been established or to 

1347
01:09:28,491 --> 01:09:32,840
make sure that algorithmize processes 
are being undertaken properly,

1348
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:34,423
you want conservatives,
they're very good at managing and 

1349
01:09:36,171 --> 01:09:37,004
they're very good at administrative 
conscientiousness is the best predictor 

1350
01:09:40,401 --> 01:09:43,250
of those two domains part from Icu.
Okay.

1351
01:09:43,251 --> 01:09:46,100
So fine.
What do you need the damn liberals for?

1352
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:49,430
Well,
you don't want them running anything but

1353
01:09:49,431 --> 01:09:53,750
you want them thinking up new things 
because the entrepreneurs and artists or

1354
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:57,620
are high in openness and low in 
conscientiousness,

1355
01:09:57,621 --> 01:09:58,454
especially orderliness and they have to 
be because if you're starting something 

1356
01:10:01,011 --> 01:10:02,810
new,
you don't want to have everything in the

1357
01:10:02,811 --> 01:10:05,180
neat little boxes.
You have to break rules,

1358
01:10:05,181 --> 01:10:06,014
you have to take things apart and so 
that liberals need the conservatives to 

1359
01:10:09,891 --> 01:10:14,020
run enterprises and the conservatives 
need the liberals to start them and then

1360
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:14,590
you.

1361
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:16,700
It makes sense from a temperamental 
perspective,

1362
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:17,563
if you think about it too,
because there's five basic personality 

1363
01:10:20,601 --> 01:10:21,434
dimensions.
They're all normally distributed and 

1364
01:10:22,461 --> 01:10:23,294
what that implies is that there's a 
niche for every personality type in 

1365
01:10:27,621 --> 01:10:28,454
proportion to the frequency of the of 
the occurrence within that normal 

1366
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:33,494
distribution.
There's some places for really 

1367
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,273
extroverted people.
There's more places for people who are 

1368
01:10:38,451 --> 01:10:40,820
moderately extroverted and moderately 
introvert,

1369
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:41,953
but there are places for everyone in 
that dimensional structure and there's 

1370
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:49,400
utility for all of those people and so 
that's why you have to keep the dialogue

1371
01:10:49,401 --> 01:10:50,810
going.
It's like if you're hyper liberal,

1372
01:10:50,811 --> 01:10:51,644
you have to talk to the damn 
conservatives because sometimes they're 

1373
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:56,750
right,
sometimes you're right,

1374
01:10:57,050 --> 01:11:01,730
but sometimes they're right,
and so if you don't talk then the system

1375
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,000
tilts off to the,
to the,

1376
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,440
to the extreme that's represented by 
that temperament.

1377
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:07,873
And so what you'd have is a bunch of 
liberals talking about new things while 

1378
01:11:09,921 --> 01:11:11,420
the buildings were falling down around 
them.

1379
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:15,810
So.
So we need each other and that's part of

1380
01:11:15,811 --> 01:11:18,450
what's happened in the West is we 
figured that out a long time ago.

1381
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,340
We figured out,
oh well you haven't got to talk to those

1382
01:11:20,341 --> 01:11:21,174
stupid people who don't think the way 
you do because sometimes despite the 

1383
01:11:24,451 --> 01:11:27,600
fact that they're annoying and nowhere 
near as smart as you,

1384
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:28,703
they're actually correct.
And so here's another way of thinking 

1385
01:11:31,801 --> 01:11:34,470
about.
Imagine the environment.

1386
01:11:34,471 --> 01:11:37,350
Does this like a snake?
It's always moving,

1387
01:11:37,351 --> 01:11:38,184
right?
You don't know where the damn thing's 

1388
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:43,650
going and you want to be in the middle.
It's like to cliffs that keeps shifting.

1389
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,810
You want to be in the middle of far from
the cliffs.

1390
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:48,900
It keeps moving around and you're trying
to walk forward.

1391
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:51,540
Well,
sometimes it's over here,

1392
01:11:51,541 --> 01:11:52,374
so the conservatives,
they have to pull it back and sometimes 

1393
01:11:54,901 --> 01:11:56,190
it's over here,
so the liberals,

1394
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:58,020
they have to pull it back and.

1395
01:11:58,050 --> 01:11:58,883
But because it keeps changing,
you don't know who's right and so you 

1396
01:12:01,591 --> 01:12:02,424
have to keep talking and that's what a 
democratic society actually allows for 

1397
01:12:06,810 --> 01:12:11,430
exchange the opinions move the damn 
polity so that we can stay in the middle

1398
01:12:11,431 --> 01:12:13,020
of the snake,
roughly speaking.

1399
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:17,100
And so you got to have some respect for 
people who aren't like you.

1400
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:22,190
They're actually not like you.
So I figured out recently I think that I

1401
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,384
couldn't figure out why openness and 
conscientiousness are the dimensions 

1402
01:12:26,611 --> 01:12:29,580
that are determining political belief 
because they're not even correlated.

1403
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,550
So why the hell do they clump for 
political belief?

1404
01:12:32,551 --> 01:12:36,600
And I think I figured it out.
I think it's because of a borders.

1405
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:41,720
I think the fundamental political issue 
is how open versus closed borders should

1406
01:12:43,021 --> 01:12:43,854
be.
And I don't just mean borders between 

1407
01:12:44,941 --> 01:12:48,180
states.
I mean borders between states,

1408
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:52,200
I mean borders between the institutions,
the borders between genders,

1409
01:12:52,230 --> 01:12:55,200
borders between sexes,
borders between ideas.

1410
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:59,280
The Conservatives say,
keep everything where it belongs because

1411
01:12:59,281 --> 01:13:02,040
it's working and the liberals say,
yeah,

1412
01:13:02,041 --> 01:13:04,680
it's working for now,
but unless we make some adjustments,

1413
01:13:04,681 --> 01:13:07,500
it's not going to keep working and 
they're both right,

1414
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:13,790
so we better have the dialogue because 
otherwise we wander off the cliff on the

1415
01:13:14,071 --> 01:13:16,350
left or the right and we know where that
goes.

1416
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:17,213
That goes.
There's flames down at the bottom of 

1417
01:13:18,121 --> 01:13:18,954
those events and people die horribly 
down there and we've seen that on the 

1418
01:13:22,351 --> 01:13:25,500
right and the left with.
We've had plenty of evidence for that.

1419
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:27,173
So

1420
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:33,480
smart sort of friends
and I have like.

1421
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:34,883
It feels like their compassion got 
twisted somehow and I have compassion 

1422
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:39,110
for that.
I don't like.

1423
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:39,983
I want to speak to to that.
These are people that I love and stuff 

1424
01:13:42,771 --> 01:13:45,660
like this and I think that they are kind
of ideologically twisted such

1425
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:49,610
well.
One of the things I've also spent a fair

1426
01:13:49,611 --> 01:13:50,444
bit of time thinking about is the role 
of the resentment plays in political 

1427
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:56,960
ideology and I have recommended in my 
lectures,

1428
01:13:56,961 --> 01:13:57,794
but I'll recommend it here too.
There's a great book by George Orwell 

1429
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:00,553
called Road to Wigan pier,
which I wouldn't Wyg in which I would 

1430
01:14:03,411 --> 01:14:06,470
highly recommend what orwell.
He was a leftist.

1431
01:14:06,471 --> 01:14:07,304
He went and fought with the on the 
communist side in the Spanish civil war 

1432
01:14:09,831 --> 01:14:11,740
against the fascists roughly.
I mean,

1433
01:14:11,741 --> 01:14:13,960
Orwell was a tough guy and very,
very smart,

1434
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:15,063
super smart.
And he went up to visit the coal miners 

1435
01:14:18,971 --> 01:14:20,810
in the 19 thirties and in,
in,

1436
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:22,890
in northern,
in northern Uk.

1437
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:24,190
I mean,
those people bad.

1438
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:27,700
They had to crawl to work for two and a 
half miles in a tunnel.

1439
01:14:27,701 --> 01:14:31,330
It was like three and a half feet high 
just to get to their shift.

1440
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:32,621
And then,
you know,

1441
01:14:32,621 --> 01:14:35,290
that meant breaking rock for seven and a
half hours.

1442
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:38,230
Then they had to crawl back and they 
didn't get paid for the commute,

1443
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:39,603
you know,
so they had rough time and they have no 

1444
01:14:41,291 --> 01:14:43,450
teeth by the time they were 30 and you 
know,

1445
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:45,940
they were done in old by the time they 
were 40.

1446
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:47,410
It was rough.
And so,

1447
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:48,910
you know,
orwell went up there and said,

1448
01:14:48,911 --> 01:14:50,820
Jesus,
industrial nightmares,

1449
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:52,560
just killing these poor oppressed 
people.

1450
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:53,410
It's like,
yeah,

1451
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:55,660
that's for sure,
and he lays it out.

1452
01:14:55,720 --> 01:15:00,720
You can read that without thinking a 
thank God I'm not a coal miner and be.

1453
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:02,763
Yeah,
it's pretty rough at the bottom of the 

1454
01:15:03,881 --> 01:15:06,700
industrial revolution,
like seriously rough,

1455
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:10,930
but in the second half of the book he 
did an analysis of socialist philosophy.

1456
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:11,853
One of the things he pointed out was 
that his observation was that the sort 

1457
01:15:15,451 --> 01:15:16,284
of middle class,
ideologically bound socialists types 

1458
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:19,660
didn't care for the poor at all.

1459
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:21,520
They just hated the rich.
It's like,

1460
01:15:21,521 --> 01:15:23,520
yes,
that's right.

1461
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,660
Not everyone.
Not everyone.

1462
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:30,400
I worked for the MVP when I was young 
and I met a number of the leaders of the

1463
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:32,320
MDP,
including grand oddly.

1464
01:15:32,321 --> 01:15:35,290
I knew him quite well.
He was Rachel Notley's father because we

1465
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:36,124
come from the same town and I had a lot 
of admiration for the leaders of the 

1466
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:40,203
back then no,
because they were really trying to give 

1467
01:15:41,351 --> 01:15:42,850
a voice to the working class.
It's like,

1468
01:15:42,851 --> 01:15:43,684
you better give a voice to the working 
class or you had never electing trump 

1469
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:48,640
for example,
but you know,

1470
01:15:48,641 --> 01:15:51,070
the Socialists have abandoned the down 
working class.

1471
01:15:51,071 --> 01:15:51,581
It's like,
no,

1472
01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:52,414
we'll go play identity politics and 
staff like that worked out really well 

1473
01:15:54,851 --> 01:15:55,684
for Hillary Clinton.
I noticed so because it was identity 

1474
01:15:58,001 --> 01:15:58,834
politics.
That's certainly shifted the election 

1475
01:16:01,121 --> 01:16:04,150
towards trump.
She lost the working class people.

1476
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:05,463
Well,
someone has to give them a voice so 

1477
01:16:07,481 --> 01:16:08,314
there are genuine.
Are People on the left were genuinely 

1478
01:16:10,361 --> 01:16:11,194
working to better.
The lot of people who because of 

1479
01:16:14,351 --> 01:16:17,230
situation haven't had the opportunity.
They might've,

1480
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:21,460
but so many people are resentful.
It's like,

1481
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:22,323
no.
If there's some people out there that 

1482
01:16:22,751 --> 01:16:23,584
have more than me,
that's a terrible thing for North 

1483
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:27,213
American to think.
It's like we're so goddamn privileged 

1484
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:29,943
that you know,
we should spend at least one extra day 

1485
01:16:31,781 --> 01:16:35,620
in hell after we die for every time we 
complained about how poor we are.

1486
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:36,911
Right.
Oh,

1487
01:16:36,911 --> 01:16:38,830
there's some people who are richer than 
me.

1488
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:41,440
Yeah.
That's pretty rough,

1489
01:16:41,441 --> 01:16:41,981
man.
That's,

1490
01:16:41,981 --> 01:16:44,500
that's a rough break for you.
You're still.

1491
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:45,463
It's the funny thing you hear about the 
one percent all the time in North 

1492
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:48,693
America.
It's like,

1493
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:49,990
oh,
the one percent.

1494
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:51,760
First of all,
that's a moving target.

1495
01:16:51,970 --> 01:16:54,280
People in the one percent shift like 
crazy.

1496
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:55,593
You have,
I think about a 10 percent chance of 

1497
01:16:56,831 --> 01:16:57,664
being in the one percent at one point in
your life and about a 40 percent chance 

1498
01:17:00,731 --> 01:17:03,190
of being in the top 10 percent for at 
least one year of your life.

1499
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:06,370
So there is a one percent,
but it's moving,

1500
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,630
but you're the bloody one percent.
Oh,

1501
01:17:09,631 --> 01:17:11,870
you have to do is compare yourself with 
the rest of the world.

1502
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:17,030
So like what are you complaining about?
These tiny proportion of people who have

1503
01:17:17,031 --> 01:17:20,210
more than you,
like what's up with you?

1504
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:23,390
How can you be so clueless that you 
would do that?

1505
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:27,350
How can you be so ungrateful and 
arrogant and blind?

1506
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:30,080
It's terrible.
I mean,

1507
01:17:30,081 --> 01:17:32,090
people have rough lives and the rest of 
the world,

1508
01:17:32,091 --> 01:17:33,350
I mean,
we're making people,

1509
01:17:33,351 --> 01:17:35,350
Richard Very fast,
you know,

1510
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:39,860
300,000 people a day now get connected 
to the electrical grid and about 250,000

1511
01:17:39,861 --> 01:17:41,690
people lifted out of abject poverty.

1512
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:43,183
We wiping out abject poverty faster than
ever before in human history by a huge 

1513
01:17:46,671 --> 01:17:49,790
margin.
So that's all for the good.

1514
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:52,040
It's really impressive.
But,

1515
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:56,210
but a huge chunk of that twisted 
compassion is just resentment.

1516
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:59,270
So since there's a few people who are 
better off than me,

1517
01:17:59,271 --> 01:18:02,330
maybe if I compare the two myself across
one dimension,

1518
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,360
Jesus dismal.
But that's what that was getting lost in

1519
01:18:05,361 --> 01:18:06,680
the discussion today.
It's all,

1520
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:09,200
it's so deflecting outward.
It's all trying to,

1521
01:18:09,201 --> 01:18:11,420
you know,
it's say it's like,

1522
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:14,410
it's this resentment is this wanting and
stuff like that.

1523
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:17,990
It's this lack of gratitude for just how
lucky we really are.

1524
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,600
And it's just this complete lack of 
insight and reflection.

1525
01:18:20,601 --> 01:18:21,790
I think that's a big problem.
Well,

1526
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:25,460
it's partly lack of historical knowledge
and it's like people,

1527
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:28,130
it's easy to take what we have for 
granted.

1528
01:18:28,131 --> 01:18:29,240
Here we are,
the lights are off.

1529
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:30,103
It's like some stupid poor son of a 
bitches out there climbing some power 

1530
01:18:33,881 --> 01:18:35,600
line in the freezing rain,
you know,

1531
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:36,553
with this damaged arm to make sure that 
we can all sit here and complain about 

1532
01:18:40,071 --> 01:18:42,080
how oppressed we are.
You know,

1533
01:18:42,081 --> 01:18:42,914
it's pretty pathetic,
but it's no wonder we take it for 

1534
01:18:44,841 --> 01:18:45,674
granted.
That's the funny thing because your 

1535
01:18:46,881 --> 01:18:50,000
minds are organized so that if something
always works,

1536
01:18:50,001 --> 01:18:52,760
you ignore it because well why would you
pay attention to it?

1537
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:53,750
Right.
It always works.

1538
01:18:53,751 --> 01:18:57,800
You don't have to pay attention to it,
so as soon as something is predictable,

1539
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,380
you zero it out and so then you think,
well,

1540
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,960
in courses like this,
this is just how it is.

1541
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:03,620
It's like,
no,

1542
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:04,453
this is not how it is.
It's a bloody miracle that this stuff 

1543
01:19:06,261 --> 01:19:07,094
works ever.
It's crazily improbable and it always 

1544
01:19:10,941 --> 01:19:11,570
breaks,
right?

1545
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:15,440
Everything is always breaking all the 
time and somebody out there dealing away

1546
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:16,880
trying to fix it.
Yes,

1547
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:21,020
so we're ungrateful partly because we 
take things that work for granted.

1548
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:24,500
If our systems worked only 99 percent of
the time,

1549
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:28,100
our society would probably be better 
because when the lights went off,

1550
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:29,940
everyone would go and the and the heat 
that,

1551
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:33,650
oh yeah,
you can't see in the dark pool.

1552
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:36,600
Then there's no furnace and it comes 
back on and you think,

1553
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:37,940
Oh yes,
that's much better,

1554
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:39,440
but it always works,
so.

1555
01:19:40,290 --> 01:19:41,300
Okay.
That's great.

1556
01:19:41,930 --> 01:19:43,790
Yes.
Speaking of envy and resentment,

1557
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:47,070
would you care to comment on the 
apparently well established numerous,

1558
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:48,043
this idea that men have a collective 
common collective interests and women 

1559
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:54,070
have a separate common collective 
interests,

1560
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:57,950
class interest,
and that these interests are becoming to

1561
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:58,784
conflict.
There's a competition sometimes on a 

1562
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,650
collective level.
Well,

1563
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:06,340
I think there is competition between men
and women,

1564
01:20:06,341 --> 01:20:10,230
but it's nested inside a broader arena 
of cooperation.

1565
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:11,453
You know,
this is another thing that you learned 

1566
01:20:12,781 --> 01:20:14,860
from reading Psj if you're,
if you're careful this,

1567
01:20:14,861 --> 01:20:15,694
but because piaget was smart enough to 
understand that there is no dichotomous 

1568
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,350
opposition between cooperation and 
competition.

1569
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:23,513
So you know,
one of the sort of tenants of the kind 

1570
01:20:25,381 --> 01:20:29,370
of this Mumbo jumbo that I hate is that 
you should.

1571
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:33,330
Kids shouldn't play competitive games,
right?

1572
01:20:33,331 --> 01:20:35,070
It shouldn't be cooperative games.
It's like,

1573
01:20:35,071 --> 01:20:36,990
okay,
let's take that apart.

1574
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:37,853
Let's take hockey.
Is it competitive or cooperative or 

1575
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:42,810
competitive?
Well,

1576
01:20:42,811 --> 01:20:45,900
wait a second.
No one brings a basketball to the hockey

1577
01:20:45,901 --> 01:20:47,200
game,
right?

1578
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,083
No one brings a chessboard.
Everyone that comes to the hockey game 

1579
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:54,210
comes there to play hockey.
That constitutes cooperation.

1580
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:58,290
We'll mutually define the aim or does 
piaget and cooperation.

1581
01:20:58,291 --> 01:21:01,380
We'll mutually define the aim,
will assign each other rules.

1582
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:04,410
We'll all agree to stick to the roles.
Well,

1583
01:21:04,411 --> 01:21:07,140
that's cooperation and if you break the 
rules,

1584
01:21:07,141 --> 01:21:09,060
what happens?
You get stuck in the penalty box.

1585
01:21:09,061 --> 01:21:12,060
You're not playing hockey off you go.
And people,

1586
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:14,940
people go off,
they go sit in the penalty box,

1587
01:21:14,941 --> 01:21:16,350
they don't go kill the referee with

1588
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:20,250
go and sit in the penalty box,
you know,

1589
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:25,290
six foot seven slash 300 pounds.
So okay.

1590
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,520
And then you think,
well what about within the team

1591
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:30,480
that cooperation or competition?
Well,

1592
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,540
each team member is trying to be the 
best player,

1593
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:37,290
but try not passing to your colleagues 
and see what happens.

1594
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:38,790
You know,
even if you're a really good,

1595
01:21:38,791 --> 01:21:41,370
they'll just,
you're just a diva and no one's going to

1596
01:21:41,371 --> 01:21:42,480
be happy with,
you know,

1597
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:44,880
they'll put horrible things in your beer
after the game.

1598
01:21:45,530 --> 01:21:46,363
So it's cooperation there as well.
And then there's a Meta level of 

1599
01:21:50,131 --> 01:21:50,964
cooperation which is that everybody's 
trying to improve their skills 

1600
01:21:53,191 --> 01:21:57,690
simultaneously and so that,
that serves a higher order good.

1601
01:21:57,870 --> 01:22:02,010
And everyone's trying to learn how to be
a good player so that they can play many

1602
01:22:02,011 --> 01:22:03,060
games.
It's like,

1603
01:22:03,061 --> 01:22:04,710
well,
we shouldn't play competitive games.

1604
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:06,930
So like you must've been educated at 
noisey.

1605
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:15,390
Sad.
It's very sad and it's so,

1606
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:20,310
so ignorant for people who know 
something about child development to say

1607
01:22:20,311 --> 01:22:23,100
something like that.
It's just what is with you,

1608
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:27,810
where were you educated or where were 
you educated is the right response.

1609
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,390
So.
And then so with men and women,

1610
01:22:30,391 --> 01:22:33,450
well there is group competition for 
example,

1611
01:22:33,451 --> 01:22:36,360
you're competing roughly speaking with 
all your classmates,

1612
01:22:36,361 --> 01:22:37,194
right?
And some of the women are going to 

1613
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:39,870
outshine you.
And so that's,

1614
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:40,723
that's tough for men.
It's particularly tough for men because 

1615
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:48,210
it isn't obvious how you compete full 
bore with women.

1616
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:51,330
It's not obvious and we don't know how 
to solve that problem.

1617
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:52,733
And then of course status in 
relationship to the male hierarchy is 

1618
01:22:56,821 --> 01:22:57,654
more important for men than it is for 
women because women pick their mates 

1619
01:23:00,271 --> 01:23:02,340
based on their position in the social 
hierarchy.

1620
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:04,740
And so that puts me in also in an 
awkward way.

1621
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,820
It puts women in an awkward position 
too,

1622
01:23:06,821 --> 01:23:07,654
like a lot of your women,
let's say there's a fair number of you 

1623
01:23:09,461 --> 01:23:13,800
here who have an Iq of more than 130 
puts you in like maybe the talk.

1624
01:23:14,370 --> 01:23:18,160
You're one in 20,
95th percentile and then you know you've

1625
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:18,994
got pretty good career proposition,
so like your pool of eligible mates is 

1626
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:27,650
minuscule that the data shows that 
clearly $50,

1627
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:28,553
if I remember correctly,
50 point increase in icu for a woman 

1628
01:23:30,851 --> 01:23:34,060
decreases your probability of finding a 
partner by 40 percent.

1629
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:37,090
It's something like that.
It has zero effect for men by the way,

1630
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,820
because men made across and down 
dominance hierarchies,

1631
01:23:39,910 --> 01:23:40,743
one across the top.
So if you're a smart woman and you're 

1632
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,133
and you're attractive and you're young 
and you're hardworking and you have a 

1633
01:23:46,361 --> 01:23:49,330
good career,
it's like you need a man who's smart,

1634
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,970
hardworking,
young who has a good career,

1635
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:54,280
but he has to be a little better at 
those things than you.

1636
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:55,210
It's like,
good luck,

1637
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:56,583
good luck.
It's going to be rough because there 

1638
01:23:57,461 --> 01:23:58,294
just aren't that many people like that.
And so there's another problem that 

1639
01:24:01,151 --> 01:24:01,984
faces women too,
which is you're not going to be smart 

1640
01:24:04,151 --> 01:24:06,730
card working with a good career till 
you're 30,

1641
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:10,300
then you have to compete with 25 year 
old women.

1642
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:11,703
And so that's also an insoluble problem 
because the thing about 25 year old 

1643
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,920
women is they put less stress on men.
Why?

1644
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:19,143
Why?
Because they can have babies for an 

1645
01:24:21,191 --> 01:24:23,060
extra five years.
So every guy pittance.

1646
01:24:23,090 --> 01:24:23,923
Yeah.
Y'All have kids sometime because he can 

1647
01:24:25,961 --> 01:24:28,090
think that he can have kids.
He's 80.

1648
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:30,560
What the hell does he care women?
No,

1649
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:32,170
no.
Thirty 5:40.

1650
01:24:32,171 --> 01:24:33,004
You better get it together by there.
And so when you're 30 and you've got 

1651
01:24:35,681 --> 01:24:36,514
your act together,
you've got those 25 year old women to 

1652
01:24:38,381 --> 01:24:39,950
compete with very.

1653
01:24:39,970 --> 01:24:42,370
And men don't care about your damn 
stamps.

1654
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:44,890
So it's rough.
It's rough.

1655
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:47,440
So there is lots of competition between 
men and women,

1656
01:24:47,441 --> 01:24:51,760
but it's nested inside a much broader 
domain of cooperation marriages.

1657
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:52,633
This fundamental solution to that.
And I think the evidence for that is 

1658
01:24:55,391 --> 01:24:58,630
also clear.
It's like it's better for women.

1659
01:24:58,690 --> 01:25:01,780
It's you have a better sex life,
you're healthier,

1660
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:02,673
your kids are better off,
you're not nearly as likely to plummet 

1661
01:25:05,531 --> 01:25:09,040
into a lower socioeconomic category,
which almost always happens to women who

1662
01:25:09,041 --> 01:25:13,060
get divorced because it's,
it's hard to one income,

1663
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:14,740
you got kids,
good luck,

1664
01:25:15,330 --> 01:25:19,720
like you're poor and if you're not,
it's because you're working so often.

1665
01:25:19,721 --> 01:25:23,030
The only time you have to have a date is
with some psychopathic man.

1666
01:25:23,970 --> 01:25:26,230
His schedule around yours.
Yeah.

1667
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:28,210
Well,
I've seen plenty of this man.

1668
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:29,673
I'm not talking through my hat.
I know exactly what the hell happens 

1669
01:25:31,901 --> 01:25:32,734
when you,
when you were a little older and a 

1670
01:25:34,091 --> 01:25:38,200
little poor and a little more desperate.
It's not exactly fun,

1671
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:39,513
so I wouldn't,
I wouldn't recommend that you end up 

1672
01:25:40,871 --> 01:25:42,010
there.
So.

1673
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:43,241
Okay.
On that.

1674
01:25:43,241 --> 01:25:44,074
Happy Valentine's Day.

1675
01:25:46,170 --> 01:25:48,470
Um,
it's two part question.

1676
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:51,740
You mentioned you were talking earlier 
about English common law.

1677
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:53,683
About 20 years ago,
I read an article from a constitutional 

1678
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:58,033
expert who,
Lauren against he the negative 

1679
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:04,040
repercussions can come from

1680
01:26:04,630 --> 01:26:09,230
the way we wrote the charter,
really codifying,

1681
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:11,510
um,
select the victim groups,

1682
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:14,170
um,
and um,

1683
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:14,920
and,
and,

1684
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:15,750
and,
and,

1685
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:20,110
and that we turned our back on 800 years
of English common law and,

1686
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:22,000
um,
uh,

1687
01:26:22,030 --> 01:26:24,000
and effectively stepped away from the 
rule of law.

1688
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:28,660
And the second,
the second part to that question,

1689
01:26:30,430 --> 01:26:35,430
the great granddaughter of
a lack of stories which your,

1690
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:36,493
that was your question and how those two
relate in my mind is my escape from a 

1691
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:45,380
communist country.
And,

1692
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:47,120
um,
and I've had,

1693
01:26:47,190 --> 01:26:48,023
you know,
dinner time conversations for decades 

1694
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:51,104
now with Michael other brother though 
about what that looked like and what 

1695
01:26:55,041 --> 01:26:56,280
that felt like.
And,

1696
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:58,730
and I think we're,
um,

1697
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:02,240
uh,
well the Baldwin's great granddaughter's

1698
01:27:02,241 --> 01:27:03,074
question was important,
which we don't have the stories that 

1699
01:27:05,991 --> 01:27:06,824
would inform us.
And you touched on that because some of 

1700
01:27:09,531 --> 01:27:12,710
the stories from your experience,
horrible,

1701
01:27:12,711 --> 01:27:13,544
horrible.
And I know there's all kinds of 

1702
01:27:14,991 --> 01:27:16,400
Canadians,
um,

1703
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:19,950
and they actually are fearful for where 
we are in society right now,

1704
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:23,300
but they're frightened to speak out.
Um,

1705
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:28,320
and I think bringing that back around to
the charter of rights and freedoms we've

1706
01:27:28,581 --> 01:27:30,020
codified,
um,

1707
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:35,500
preferred,
but we've overlooked in that most,

1708
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,220
most,
um,

1709
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:38,203
trauma and abuse happens within groups 
and also the case earlier we started 

1710
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:45,133
overlooked and it someone because just 
because someone said it doesn't mean 

1711
01:27:49,281 --> 01:27:51,830
that they're also not a perpetrator.
Um,

1712
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:53,330
and that doesn't get,
um,

1713
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:54,980
a lot of press.
So

1714
01:27:55,210 --> 01:27:56,043
yeah,
whenever anyone claims victim status 

1715
01:27:57,221 --> 01:27:59,800
without simultaneously claiming 
perpetrator status,

1716
01:27:59,801 --> 01:28:00,634
you should run away from that person.
It's like I'm a saint and everyone's 

1717
01:28:03,491 --> 01:28:04,700
been hurting me.
It's not.

1718
01:28:04,701 --> 01:28:05,650
No,
probably not.

1719
01:28:05,710 --> 01:28:07,410
Sorry,
you're a saint.

1720
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:09,040
Really?
I don't think so.

1721
01:28:09,610 --> 01:28:10,443
I doubt it.
I've imagined you have your fair share 

1722
01:28:12,611 --> 01:28:15,640
of,
of abstract blonde to one of your hands,

1723
01:28:15,641 --> 01:28:16,474
just like everybody else.
And so people need to take 

1724
01:28:18,011 --> 01:28:21,040
responsibility for that mean speed.
Okay.

1725
01:28:21,041 --> 01:28:22,930
So just one more

1726
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:24,833
and I'm wondering if what you're talking
just reading now is basically what I 

1727
01:28:28,861 --> 01:28:30,270
didn't know.
She didn't you decades ago.

1728
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:31,573
Morning,

1729
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,313
Oh yeah,
that was a catastrophe to lay that bit 

1730
01:28:35,301 --> 01:28:38,450
of logical rationality on top of the 
English law.

1731
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:39,523
Common law system was a catastrophe.
It was unnecessary and it is resulting 

1732
01:28:44,271 --> 01:28:45,104
in much of what we're seeing today.
The problem with the codify bill of 

1733
01:28:46,941 --> 01:28:50,390
rights,
the rights conflict right now,

1734
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:52,550
English common law dealt with it by just
saying,

1735
01:28:52,551 --> 01:28:54,320
forget we're not a new marine and you're
damn right.

1736
01:28:54,321 --> 01:28:56,450
So you have all of them.
Okay,

1737
01:28:57,260 --> 01:28:59,120
what problems are,
is that going to solve it?

1738
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:00,103
We don't care.
We'll solve them one by one as they 

1739
01:29:02,041 --> 01:29:03,990
emerge.
Brilliant.

1740
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:06,570
It's an evolutionary approach to law.
Essentially.

1741
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:11,730
English common law is phenomenal and we 
made a huge mistake codifying our rights

1742
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:12,623
I think,
and that that is part of what's put us 

1743
01:29:14,491 --> 01:29:17,390
here and then building in the victim 
hood of,

1744
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,380
of groups,
that's a hell of a thing to tell someone

1745
01:29:19,381 --> 01:29:21,270
to your part of the victim group.

1746
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:24,630
It's like,
it's so clueless historically too,

1747
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,200
you know,
um,

1748
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:30,390
that surfs in the Ussr who are pretty 
much all Caucasian.

1749
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:32,880
They weren't emancipated until the late 
18 hundreds.

1750
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:33,743
Like you don't have to go very far back 
in anybody's racial history to find the 

1751
01:29:38,551 --> 01:29:40,380
equivalent of slavery.
I mean,

1752
01:29:40,381 --> 01:29:41,830
okay,
surfs weren't slaves.

1753
01:29:41,831 --> 01:29:42,171
It's.
Yeah,

1754
01:29:42,171 --> 01:29:43,170
yeah,
they were.

1755
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:46,200
They were.
They were sold with the property,

1756
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:48,900
you know,
and so that's 150 years ago.

1757
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:50,243
Slavery was.
Slavery was not some exception 

1758
01:29:51,961 --> 01:29:54,270
perpetrated on the world by the United 
States.

1759
01:29:54,271 --> 01:29:55,104
Every damn society,
virtually that ever existed up until we 

1760
01:29:57,841 --> 01:30:00,630
invented machines,
ran on slave labor.

1761
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:02,880
So saying,
well,

1762
01:30:03,150 --> 01:30:03,983
you know,
some groups have been affected more by 

1763
01:30:08,011 --> 01:30:11,430
slavery in the recent past than others.
I think that's fair to say it,

1764
01:30:11,431 --> 01:30:14,370
but the problem is as well,
what exactly do you do about that,

1765
01:30:14,371 --> 01:30:15,750
Dan?
And who defines it to?

1766
01:30:16,530 --> 01:30:17,363
It's a big mess and besides none of it 
is to be trusted anyways because all it 

1767
01:30:20,881 --> 01:30:25,140
is is postmodern deal marks sleight of 
hand.

1768
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:28,050
You know,
Marxism got demolished in the seventies.

1769
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,990
Demolished,
ruined was never to rise again.

1770
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:35,760
The postmodernists sneaky friendships 
and French intellectuals played a little

1771
01:30:35,761 --> 01:30:36,990
slight of hand.
Okay.

1772
01:30:37,110 --> 01:30:40,620
It's not the working class against the 
wealthy.

1773
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:44,460
It's the victims against the oppressors.
Great.

1774
01:30:46,050 --> 01:30:48,120
All we did was move the goalposts 
slightly.

1775
01:30:48,121 --> 01:30:50,370
Now we get to play the same game.
Yeah.

1776
01:30:50,371 --> 01:30:52,200
Well,
it's a lot easier than thinking.

1777
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:56,800
So yeah,
competence.

1778
01:30:58,470 --> 01:30:59,640
That's what they thought.

1779
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:05,610
Oh,
that's a good question.

1780
01:31:05,611 --> 01:31:06,444
I teach about the gulag.
Archipelago is my personality class of 

1781
01:31:08,391 --> 01:31:11,150
hold the dopey places to teach it.
It's like I,

1782
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,510
at the beginning of the class,
I say,

1783
01:31:12,511 --> 01:31:14,610
well,
how many of you know that 30 million,

1784
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:15,990
uh,
uh,

1785
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:19,860
Soviet citizens were destroyed through 
internal repression between 19,

1786
01:31:19,861 --> 01:31:23,410
19 in 1959.
It's like four people put up their hands

1787
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:23,791
and they say,
well,

1788
01:31:23,791 --> 01:31:26,370
how do you know I watched your lectures 
on youtube?

1789
01:31:26,930 --> 01:31:28,920
You know,
that's not taught in school.

1790
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:30,750
Why?
I know why.

1791
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:34,710
It's because the bloody intellectual 
leftists have never apologized for their

1792
01:31:34,711 --> 01:31:38,760
complicity in the catastrophes of the 
20th century for Germans,

1793
01:31:38,761 --> 01:31:42,900
apologized.
Sorry about the Nazis with the left wing

1794
01:31:42,901 --> 01:31:43,830
intellectuals.
They say,

1795
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:44,820
oh,
well that was real.

1796
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,530
That wasn't real Marxism.
So like,

1797
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,310
oh,
okay.

1798
01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:48,143
How many carbs is have to pile up around
you before you're willing to question 

1799
01:31:51,541 --> 01:31:53,560
your beloved it?

1800
01:31:53,630 --> 01:31:54,463
Theological presuppositions and face 
your resentment and your narcissism and 

1801
01:31:59,411 --> 01:32:03,040
your desire for destruction.
You don't like people anyways.

1802
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:06,760
The planet has too many of them,
so like a nice warm.

1803
01:32:06,761 --> 01:32:10,120
I cleared that up.
Well then all the plants can grow again.

1804
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:11,983
You know the club of Rome and they 
talked about the population explosion 

1805
01:32:14,621 --> 01:32:16,720
that was going to wipe out the planet by
the year 2000.

1806
01:32:16,721 --> 01:32:19,600
They say outright that human beings were
a cancer on the planet.

1807
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:21,460
Lots of people think that.
It's like,

1808
01:32:21,490 --> 01:32:22,323
oh boy,
next put the atom bomb a phone in your 

1809
01:32:24,971 --> 01:32:27,940
hands.
Human beings are a cancer on the planet.

1810
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:32,320
What a hell of a thing to say?
You're saying that to a four year old,

1811
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:33,423
I saw bloody professor at Queen's 
University tell a whole room full of 18 

1812
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:40,210
year olds that if they had an ethical 
fiber in their body,

1813
01:32:40,211 --> 01:32:41,044
they wouldn't have any kids or they'd 
only have one because all they're doing 

1814
01:32:43,631 --> 01:32:45,640
is going out there raping the planet.

1815
01:32:46,090 --> 01:32:47,620
It's like,
what?

1816
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:48,850
You know?
What the hell?

1817
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,770
What?
I don't understand that.

1818
01:32:50,771 --> 01:32:53,050
It's like human beings are hard on the 
planet,

1819
01:32:53,051 --> 01:32:55,300
but it's pretty damn hard on us in 
return,

1820
01:32:55,301 --> 01:32:56,134
you know?
It's like we're just sort of trying not 

1821
01:32:57,251 --> 01:33:00,100
to die to miserably and we make a bit of
a mess.

1822
01:33:00,101 --> 01:33:00,811
Well,
doing it.

1823
01:33:00,811 --> 01:33:01,750
It's like,
yeah,

1824
01:33:02,050 --> 01:33:02,883
Chris,
we've only known for 50 years that we 

1825
01:33:04,241 --> 01:33:07,990
were disrupting the oceans.
How fast do you think we can learn?

1826
01:33:08,730 --> 01:33:10,210
You know,
100 years ago,

1827
01:33:10,270 --> 01:33:12,980
Thomas Huxley,
who was a great biologist,

1828
01:33:12,981 --> 01:33:15,870
said,
the oceans are so plentiful.

1829
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:18,190
It was not a chance we could ever put a 
dam in them.

1830
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:21,220
So I was only 100 years ago.
Fifty years ago we thought,

1831
01:33:21,221 --> 01:33:22,054
Oh man,
there's more of us and we're better at 

1832
01:33:23,081 --> 01:33:24,640
this than we thought.
It's like,

1833
01:33:24,641 --> 01:33:27,130
okay,
how fast do you expect people to learn?

1834
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:29,320
You know,
one generation,

1835
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:32,020
one year,
we're trying to do our best.

1836
01:33:32,050 --> 01:33:32,883
Most.
Most people are trying to do their best 

1837
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:37,330
and some people are trying to do their 
worst,

1838
01:33:37,331 --> 01:33:38,164
but most people are trying to do their 
best and so we should have a little 

1839
01:33:40,541 --> 01:33:43,060
compassion,
little sympathy for human beings instead

1840
01:33:43,061 --> 01:33:47,260
of considering ourselves like raping 
patriarchal,

1841
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:49,510
oppressive destroyers.
Of the world,

1842
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:52,690
Jesus,
you don't like that label.

1843
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,560
So cruel.
It's so mean.

1844
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:57,191
It's,
it's.

1845
01:33:57,191 --> 01:33:58,024
It has no sympathy there.
It's like most of the people I know are 

1846
01:34:00,911 --> 01:34:03,010
struggling hard to get fine.
Usually.

1847
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:06,310
The other thing about people that's so 
interesting and you really learn this if

1848
01:34:06,311 --> 01:34:07,144
you're a clinical psychologist,
is that every single one of you in this 

1849
01:34:09,881 --> 01:34:14,020
room has at least one serious problem 
that you're laboring under,

1850
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:17,200
and that's why the whole handicap thing 
is a big problem as well.

1851
01:34:17,201 --> 01:34:18,460
It's like,
okay,

1852
01:34:18,461 --> 01:34:21,730
you're not mentally ill this moment,
but you will be.

1853
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:22,743
You'll be depressed or anxious or you'll
hit some trauma in your life that'll 

1854
01:34:25,121 --> 01:34:25,954
take you out,
and even if you happen to be in the 

1855
01:34:27,491 --> 01:34:28,324
small minority of people who are 
physically healthy their whole life and 

1856
01:34:30,491 --> 01:34:33,070
emotionally healthy,
you're going to have a family member,

1857
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:34,420
a child,
a parent,

1858
01:34:34,421 --> 01:34:37,750
a parent with Alzheimer's,
a child who's got some illness.

1859
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:38,823
You know you're going to be carrying 
some vicious burden for most of your 

1860
01:34:41,621 --> 01:34:42,454
life and most of the time you're going 
to stumble off the work anyhow and do 

1861
01:34:46,961 --> 01:34:50,920
your damn job and contribute to society.
It's like I can never,

1862
01:34:50,921 --> 01:34:51,754
I can't even believe that our system 
works because you just have to talk to 

1863
01:34:54,671 --> 01:34:56,350
someone for five minutes and they tell 
you,

1864
01:34:56,351 --> 01:34:57,184
well,
here's the three horrible things that 

1865
01:34:58,521 --> 01:35:01,850
happened to me in the last year,
and they're horrible things.

1866
01:35:01,851 --> 01:35:03,670
Their mother died of like,
you know,

1867
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:08,000
some degenerative neurological disease.
Those are particularly entertaining.

1868
01:35:08,001 --> 01:35:11,390
And their father was alcoholic and he 
used to beat them up and their sisters,

1869
01:35:11,391 --> 01:35:13,130
schizophrenia can,
it's like

1870
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:15,583
right away they go and do their minor 
hero wisdom for the day and the light 

1871
01:35:18,261 --> 01:35:19,250
stay on.
It's like,

1872
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:20,773
you know,
human beings were admirable creatures 

1873
01:35:22,281 --> 01:35:23,690
despite the fact that we're,
you know,

1874
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:27,650
finite and useless and vicious and all 
of those things.

1875
01:35:27,651 --> 01:35:28,484
So

1876
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:32,850
it did
incorporate

1877
01:35:38,490 --> 01:35:42,780
physician suicide.
Should I tell him what to do?

1878
01:35:45,820 --> 01:35:48,160
Well,
you should pay very careful attention to

1879
01:35:48,161 --> 01:35:48,994
their definitions of diversity.
And then you have to pay careful 

1880
01:35:51,881 --> 01:35:55,840
attention to the criteria by which you 
choose people.

1881
01:35:56,230 --> 01:35:57,460
You know,
it's very,

1882
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:58,353
that's an extraordinarily difficult 
question because it's a personnel 

1883
01:36:00,161 --> 01:36:00,994
selection,

1884
01:36:01,370 --> 01:36:02,203
uh,

1885
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,400
decision.
But one of the things I would say is,

1886
01:36:04,401 --> 01:36:05,234
well,
if you're looking for managers and 

1887
01:36:05,721 --> 01:36:07,760
administrators,
screenings for conscientiousness,

1888
01:36:08,450 --> 01:36:11,090
you get about a point two,
five point three correlation.

1889
01:36:11,130 --> 01:36:13,130
You think,
well that's nothing that's wrong.

1890
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:15,800
It switches your probability of hiring 
a,

1891
01:36:16,290 --> 01:36:21,290
an above average employee from 50 slash 
50 to 67 point five slash 32 point five.

1892
01:36:21,410 --> 01:36:24,710
If it's a point three,
three zero,

1893
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:25,880
let's see,
sorry,

1894
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:26,713
60 5:35 point three zero correlation.
And because there's massive variability 

1895
01:36:32,181 --> 01:36:34,280
in the productivity of individuals 
tilting,

1896
01:36:34,281 --> 01:36:37,100
your selection up to that degree will 
have massive,

1897
01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:40,620
massive economic payoffs.
I've done the calculation.

1898
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:45,050
There are crazy and there's no.
There's no bias in a conscientiousness.

1899
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:45,893
Tests

1900
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:52,200
test for hiring for that.

1901
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,810
When the court says the board,
the board

1902
01:37:03,190 --> 01:37:04,023
during the diversity officer,
one of the things you might do is track 

1903
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:11,900
the shifting ratio of men versus women 
in the corporation.

1904
01:37:11,901 --> 01:37:15,080
But that's the sort of thing that 
requires a micro analysis.

1905
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:17,780
Know like there's going to be an 
increasingly.

1906
01:37:17,781 --> 01:37:18,614
There are many disciplines where women 
are overrepresented at every single 

1907
01:37:21,591 --> 01:37:23,630
level that's happening in university so 
fast.

1908
01:37:23,631 --> 01:37:26,780
Don't be a damn man left in the Faculty 
of Arts and science at 10 years.

1909
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:29,060
It's like,
so for all you women who are looking for

1910
01:37:29,061 --> 01:37:29,894
mates,
you better be thinking about that 

1911
01:37:31,010 --> 01:37:33,320
because when men of bailing out of 
university so fast,

1912
01:37:33,321 --> 01:37:34,970
you cannot believe it.
I'm like,

1913
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:35,833
I've watched the curves for 15 years,
so linear up for women linear down for 

1914
01:37:39,571 --> 01:37:41,570
me,
and so you can think,

1915
01:37:41,571 --> 01:37:43,280
well that's really good for women.
It's like

1916
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:48,260
that's so clueless is there can't be 
anything that's bad for men.

1917
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:52,820
That's good for women and vice versa.
I know another thing too.

1918
01:37:52,821 --> 01:37:54,450
That's okay.
So back to the board,

1919
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:55,303
you have to say,
well,

1920
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:59,700
the what's the industry?
How does that map onto the valid natural

1921
01:37:59,701 --> 01:38:00,534
interests of men and women?
Is there any evidence that we're hiring 

1922
01:38:03,811 --> 01:38:04,644
stupidly and the mere fact that you 
don't have as many women or as many men 

1923
01:38:07,891 --> 01:38:12,600
in one place versus another doesn't 
indicate therefore that your prejudice,

1924
01:38:13,050 --> 01:38:15,300
you have to buy the equity argument to 
buy that.

1925
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:17,970
And if you buy the equity argument while
you're done with anyway,

1926
01:38:17,971 --> 01:38:18,804
so,
so because you're going to fall down 

1927
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:21,870
that spiral move,
never get out of it,

1928
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:24,930
you'll never hit equity.
Not a chance.

1929
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:29,460
Now a lot of these corporations are 
doing it out of guilt and fear.

1930
01:38:29,461 --> 01:38:31,890
You don't.
You said that people are afraid to speak

1931
01:38:31,891 --> 01:38:32,724
up for Jesus.
You just have no idea how afraid people 

1932
01:38:34,501 --> 01:38:35,334
are to speak up.

1933
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:37,560
And it's actually no wonder.
I mean,

1934
01:38:37,561 --> 01:38:40,290
I've made those videos.
It was like I got hit by a tidal wave.

1935
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:43,170
No,
it freaked me right out and still does.

1936
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:45,750
I can't believe what happened.
Like it's been.

1937
01:38:45,751 --> 01:38:46,584
I would say overall it's been good,
but it's not necessarily the kind of 

1938
01:38:49,741 --> 01:38:52,920
good you would wish on someone.
I kind of would like to have my old life

1939
01:38:52,921 --> 01:38:54,570
back,
but whatever,

1940
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,490
you know,
I knew what was coming.

1941
01:38:56,491 --> 01:39:01,020
So it was only a matter of time.
But people are so afraid to speak up.

1942
01:39:01,021 --> 01:39:04,110
You just cannot believe it.
Tenured professors,

1943
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:09,030
those are the most protected people in 
the universe and they're afraid to speak

1944
01:39:09,031 --> 01:39:09,864
up.
And that tells you a lot about what 

1945
01:39:11,821 --> 01:39:13,290
people are like,
but I should tell you,

1946
01:39:13,291 --> 01:39:16,080
you shouldn't be afraid to speak up,
but I'll tell you something else.

1947
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,270
You should be more afraid not to speak 
up.

1948
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:22,140
That's the thing.
It's like you're screwed both ways.

1949
01:39:22,650 --> 01:39:23,483
Pick your poison.
You can either suffer the consequences 

1950
01:39:26,881 --> 01:39:31,380
of having a voice or you can suffer the 
consequences of not having a voice.

1951
01:39:31,650 --> 01:39:35,370
And I would highly recommend that you 
don't pick the suffering that goes along

1952
01:39:35,371 --> 01:39:40,020
with not having a voice that's dreadful.
And so you might say,

1953
01:39:40,021 --> 01:39:41,010
well,
if I don't speak up,

1954
01:39:41,011 --> 01:39:41,970
I'm safe.
It's like,

1955
01:39:41,971 --> 01:39:44,340
yeah,
you are for for the next 15 minutes,

1956
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:48,630
but you sacrificed a bit of your soul.
You might need that thing to get through

1957
01:39:48,631 --> 01:39:51,420
life without getting all bitter and 
twisted and resentful.

1958
01:39:51,930 --> 01:39:55,920
So if you've got something to say,
maybe even to your board,

1959
01:39:56,430 --> 01:39:59,580
you say it and you don't know what's 
going to happen,

1960
01:39:59,850 --> 01:40:01,470
it might be bad.
It might be good.

1961
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:05,340
Like silence has exactly the same 
consequences.

1962
01:40:06,090 --> 01:40:06,923
So and Dr Peterson's hiring.
So when they get rid of it or they're 

1963
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:11,313
hiring to replace me there,
not by the way the university is backed 

1964
01:40:14,401 --> 01:40:15,234
off completely and I'm sure that was a 
big part of because of the older public 

1965
01:40:19,351 --> 01:40:20,790
support,
you know,

1966
01:40:20,791 --> 01:40:21,624
not that I mean I'm not trying to paint 
them as evil villains because they're 

1967
01:40:24,010 --> 01:40:24,843
not.

1968
01:40:25,110 --> 01:40:25,943
But also the students were very 
welcoming to me when I came back to 

1969
01:40:28,321 --> 01:40:29,154
class,
which was a big deal because I was very 

1970
01:40:30,571 --> 01:40:33,240
nervous when I came back to class,
like very nervous.

1971
01:40:33,330 --> 01:40:34,163
I didn't know what the hell was going to
happen or even if I was going to come 

1972
01:40:36,091 --> 01:40:37,980
back.
So.

1973
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:39,293
But
there's one more question or two 

1974
01:40:43,321 --> 01:40:44,720
questions.
And then Colorado.

1975
01:40:44,950 --> 01:40:49,950
Okay.
Difficult for you to say

1976
01:40:54,490 --> 01:40:55,323
you would not recommend that today's you
attended university in the traditional 

1977
01:40:59,021 --> 01:41:00,130
sense.
Um,

1978
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:01,193
so I to know what advice you would have 
for people as far into the clinical 

1979
01:41:04,511 --> 01:41:09,100
psychologist or want to pursue any 
further education.

1980
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:17,260
Don't take any nonsense.

1981
01:41:18,170 --> 01:41:19,003
Read the damn classics.
You don't know in clinical psychology 

1982
01:41:21,291 --> 01:41:24,170
programs here,
you're reading that bloody waiting,

1983
01:41:24,171 --> 01:41:28,190
derald sue or whatever his name.
Is it a microaggression guy.

1984
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:29,493
You know,
it's like,

1985
01:41:29,810 --> 01:41:31,880
here's how you do cross cultural 
counseling,

1986
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:34,760
so I know that that's a bunch of things 
you don't do.

1987
01:41:34,790 --> 01:41:35,421
Like,
I mean,

1988
01:41:35,421 --> 01:41:36,254
that's what the books are.
Here's things that you shouldn't do if 

1989
01:41:37,911 --> 01:41:40,190
you're doing cross cultural constantly 
and that's helpful,

1990
01:41:40,191 --> 01:41:42,800
but what are you going to do?
Reading Freud,

1991
01:41:42,860 --> 01:41:44,360
read young,
read Adler,

1992
01:41:44,361 --> 01:41:45,380
greed,
Rogers,

1993
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:46,233
read mass up.
These people knew what the hell they 

1994
01:41:48,051 --> 01:41:50,570
were talking about.
The behaviors get,

1995
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:53,960
get yourself educated with regards to 
neuroscience.

1996
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:55,333
There's lots of great things out there 
to read and if your professors are too 

1997
01:41:57,531 --> 01:41:59,720
stupid to teach you what they should 
teach you with you,

1998
01:41:59,830 --> 01:42:02,210
you got to educate yourself and 
university anyways,

1999
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:04,780
you know,
so,

2000
01:42:04,850 --> 01:42:06,230
so that's what I would recommend.

2001
01:42:06,590 --> 01:42:09,090
The institution is corrupt always.
And so you know,

2002
01:42:09,170 --> 01:42:11,850
you're lucky you're lucky if you're in 
graduate,

2003
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:14,900
graduate school,
like one in five classes is really worth

2004
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:16,190
taking.
You know,

2005
01:42:17,210 --> 01:42:18,043
you can't get too cynical about that.
Things don't necessarily work all that 

2006
01:42:21,261 --> 01:42:23,720
well,
but there are great things to read.

2007
01:42:23,810 --> 01:42:26,360
I mean,
radio don't turn you inside out,

2008
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:28,100
you know,
read nature.

2009
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:30,740
There's lots of great thinkers there and
you know,

2010
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:31,583
you have to read them intelligently.
People squawk about nature because he 

2011
01:42:33,741 --> 01:42:36,320
was slightly misogynistic,
but I mean,

2012
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:37,790
God,
he was sick.

2013
01:42:37,791 --> 01:42:38,624
He could hardly even see.
You can only write like one sentence at 

2014
01:42:40,701 --> 01:42:42,470
a time.
He lived alone.

2015
01:42:42,770 --> 01:42:45,530
He didn't get along with women.
They were always rejecting them,

2016
01:42:45,710 --> 01:42:49,000
you know,
not the same thing to do with the women.

2017
01:42:49,460 --> 01:42:52,070
And he didn't know if anyone ever was 
ever going to read what he wrote.

2018
01:42:52,071 --> 01:42:54,920
He sold like 500 copies of beyond good 
and evil.

2019
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:57,080
It's like,
so now when they did go to Noida,

2020
01:42:57,090 --> 01:43:00,740
didn't wrote something snippy.
It's like Jesus gave the guy a break,

2021
01:43:01,350 --> 01:43:04,760
you know?
And so when you read Freud as well,

2022
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:07,730
you know,
this stuff's dated so you have to adjust

2023
01:43:07,731 --> 01:43:12,150
your reading for the context.
But when someone comes across a slate of

2024
01:43:12,170 --> 01:43:14,500
mysogeny mystic statement and says,
Oh,

2025
01:43:14,501 --> 01:43:17,450
well I'm not reading this person,
all they're saying is they're too stupid

2026
01:43:17,451 --> 01:43:20,000
to separate the wheat from the chaff or 
too lazy.

2027
01:43:20,001 --> 01:43:20,451
It's like,
well,

2028
01:43:20,451 --> 01:43:22,490
I don't have to read nature.
Well that's a relief,

2029
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:24,290
that's for sure.
Really.

2030
01:43:25,820 --> 01:43:26,653
So I was thinking more about parents who
are trying to make a decision to send 

2031
01:43:30,021 --> 01:43:31,820
their kids to university.
It's like

2032
01:43:34,870 --> 01:43:39,490
so much of it is corrupt social work and
anthropology,

2033
01:43:40,270 --> 01:43:42,910
social psychology,
education,

2034
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:47,260
English literature.
A huge chunk of the humanities,

2035
01:43:47,261 --> 01:43:48,094
which is absolute catastrophe.
The humanities school universities are 

2036
01:43:50,441 --> 01:43:54,830
done because they're the sole of the 
universities technical training.

2037
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:56,153
There's.
You can be trained technically in all 

2038
01:43:57,111 --> 01:43:57,944
sorts of other ways.
Incorporations are starting to figure 

2039
01:43:59,211 --> 01:44:02,560
this out fast.
So we lose the humanities.

2040
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:03,403
The universities are gone and we're 
losing them fast because all they do is 

2041
01:44:06,471 --> 01:44:10,040
teach you identity politics.
Jesus,

2042
01:44:10,041 --> 01:44:13,460
you can learn the rules that came in one
day,

2043
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:14,893
right?
Divide the world into oppressed and 

2044
01:44:16,551 --> 01:44:17,960
oppressor.
That's easy,

2045
01:44:17,990 --> 01:44:19,130
man.
That's a snap.

2046
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:20,563
Assume the old presses are the bad 
people in the oppressed or the good 

2047
01:44:22,701 --> 01:44:24,110
people that's easy.

2048
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:29,580
Make noise about it and feel good.
That's basically that.

2049
01:44:31,180 --> 01:44:33,500
And you know,
don't pay any attention to your role.

2050
01:44:35,710 --> 01:44:36,543
So $2,000
while in the university is a for a big 

2051
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:43,910
shakeup because they don't know what's 
going to hit them with,

2052
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:44,833
with youtube and online lectures.
They've got no idea what's coming down 

2053
01:44:48,290 --> 01:44:50,260
the pipes,
so because it,

2054
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:54,500
because online lectures are powerful 
beyond belief and someone who's going to

2055
01:44:54,501 --> 01:44:57,350
sort out the accreditation for all in 
the next four or five years,

2056
01:44:57,410 --> 01:44:59,180
a couple universities off at their 
knees,

2057
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:03,530
so certainly going to come within the 
next 10 years.

2058
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:04,510
My question

2059
01:45:04,510 --> 01:45:09,510
for is as a training therapist for her,
how do you think that that might bags?

2060
01:45:11,770 --> 01:45:14,490
That's the process of therapy.

2061
01:45:15,390 --> 01:45:17,520
Well,
it puts you in there with all sorts of a

2062
01:45:17,521 --> 01:45:18,354
priori axioms.
Know one of the things I really liked 

2063
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:22,073
Carl Rogers and one of the things Rogers
does is listen to what you do as a 

2064
01:45:27,781 --> 01:45:28,614
therapist.
The better you aren't listening to 

2065
01:45:30,211 --> 01:45:31,044
pastor,
your clients will get better and you 

2066
01:45:32,131 --> 01:45:36,000
have to listen without prejudice and I 
don't mean that in the technical sense.

2067
01:45:36,001 --> 01:45:36,541
It's like,
okay,

2068
01:45:36,541 --> 01:45:38,660
so I'm listening to you.
It's like I don't know what you're going

2069
01:45:38,661 --> 01:45:43,590
to say and I don't know if you're right 
and I'm not going to tell you what to do

2070
01:45:43,770 --> 01:45:44,603
because I don't know what you should do.
And that's something about being a 

2071
01:45:47,131 --> 01:45:47,964
therapist is like you do not want to 
tell people what to do because that's 

2072
01:45:51,211 --> 01:45:52,044
their life that you might screw it up.
So what do you want to do is listen to 

2073
01:45:55,471 --> 01:45:58,230
them very,
very carefully and let them unwind their

2074
01:45:58,231 --> 01:45:59,040
story.

2075
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,200
And most of them they'll take care of 
themselves,

2076
01:46:01,550 --> 01:46:02,383
you know,
because no one's listened to them so 

2077
01:46:04,021 --> 01:46:04,854
they don't even know what they think 
their head is full of jumbled mess of 

2078
01:46:08,281 --> 01:46:09,114
thoughts and experiences.
It's like it's like a tangling of knots 

2079
01:46:12,570 --> 01:46:17,070
and maybe the person needs to talk for 
like three years to sort it all out.

2080
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:21,090
And what you should do is listen to them
from a different culture,

2081
01:46:21,091 --> 01:46:21,924
whatever,
like there's going to be friction 

2082
01:46:22,651 --> 01:46:25,710
because of that,
because you'll come out at least to some

2083
01:46:25,711 --> 01:46:27,360
degree with different assumptions.
But

2084
01:46:28,890 --> 01:46:31,910
read the damn therapists.
Those people were smart.

2085
01:46:32,140 --> 01:46:32,973
They tell you things about.
Each of them gives you a different 

2086
01:46:34,831 --> 01:46:37,290
toolbox.
They're not scientific theories.

2087
01:46:37,291 --> 01:46:38,670
Exactly,
but as a clinician,

2088
01:46:38,690 --> 01:46:40,710
you're not a scientist.
You're a.

2089
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:44,610
you're an engineer of the soul.
That's a better way of thinking about it

2090
01:46:44,611 --> 01:46:45,870
because it's an applied.

2091
01:46:45,950 --> 01:46:48,540
It's like engineering,
it's an applied science,

2092
01:46:48,870 --> 01:46:50,700
so makes it not a science.
Exactly.

2093
01:46:50,701 --> 01:46:55,701
You can use scientific knowledge,
but you're still aiming at the good,

2094
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:57,173
right?
That's what you're doing as a therapist 

2095
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:00,090
with the other person.
You say,

2096
01:47:00,091 --> 01:47:00,924
look,
you already know that things aren't as 

2097
01:47:02,731 --> 01:47:03,564
good for you as they need to be.
We're going to work on that and you're 

2098
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:07,073
here to make things better and I'm here 
to help you figure out how to make 

2099
01:47:09,991 --> 01:47:10,824
things better.
Then I'll listen to you and we'll move 

2100
01:47:13,171 --> 01:47:14,004
toward some place that's lighter and 
better and and then you have tools that 

2101
01:47:18,211 --> 01:47:19,044
you can use in that kind of analytical 
listening process and the great 

2102
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:25,830
psychotherapists math.
Most people have their 10,000 hours,

2103
01:47:25,831 --> 01:47:26,664
you know,
they all come at it from slightly 

2104
01:47:27,841 --> 01:47:28,674
different.
Temperamental perspectives like young's 

2105
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:33,300
work is really useful for dealing with 
people who are high in openness.

2106
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:36,810
So his whole philosophy is you have an 
open client,

2107
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:39,870
you'll works if you have a conservative 
clients,

2108
01:47:39,871 --> 01:47:41,160
forget it.
It's,

2109
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:42,330
it's a whole different thing.

2110
01:47:43,490 --> 01:47:44,323
What I'm hearing from you is that that 
postmodern stance is helpful for the 

2111
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:49,613
therapy from off,
from what you're saying is that listen 

2112
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:53,780
and that you're,
that you're not giving an absolute truth

2113
01:47:53,781 --> 01:47:55,190
to these,
to these clients.

2114
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:56,093
Yeah,
but the problem is the postmodern thing 

2115
01:47:57,601 --> 01:48:00,090
works out pretty well,
but they keep asking it in Marxism.

2116
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:01,170
It's like,
oh yeah,

2117
01:48:01,170 --> 01:48:06,170
but their primary identity is,
is is like sex or gender or ethnicity or

2118
01:48:06,811 --> 01:48:07,740
race.
It's like,

2119
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:08,940
no,
sorry,

2120
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:10,373
we're not going there,
so it's not exactly postmodernism 

2121
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:14,753
because the postmodernists are 
misinformed about the nature of 

2122
01:48:18,270 --> 01:48:19,103
scientific theories.
I think they don't really see them as 

2123
01:48:21,121 --> 01:48:21,954
tools,
but I see the best tools and so you can 

2124
01:48:24,781 --> 01:48:27,670
have a diverse range of tools and they 
don't eat.

2125
01:48:28,050 --> 01:48:32,730
Each one doesn't have to claim a pistol 
biological or ontological priority,

2126
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:33,953
but that means that you have to view 
those sorts of theories as tools that 

2127
01:48:36,481 --> 01:48:40,310
makes you a pragmatist post modernists.
All right,

2128
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:42,190
and speaking of patients.
Okay,

2129
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:44,353
in an hour or so,
a few things I want to wrap up now just 

2130
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:47,313
to that point.
I said this earlier today and first of 

2131
01:48:50,051 --> 01:48:50,884
all,
one of the reasons I really wanted to 

2132
01:48:51,101 --> 01:48:53,290
have Dr Peterson comment,
and first of all,

2133
01:48:53,291 --> 01:48:55,120
Cirina,
thank you very much for arranging that.

2134
01:48:55,340 --> 01:48:56,081
Uh,
she did.

2135
01:48:56,081 --> 01:48:58,410
She said that she wants to go to have 
you come in and say,

2136
01:48:58,411 --> 01:48:59,244
yeah,
sure.

2137
01:48:59,260 --> 01:49:01,380
And she did it until he really 
appreciate a serene.

2138
01:49:01,381 --> 01:49:02,510
It'd be,
especially Dr Peterson,

2139
01:49:08,330 --> 01:49:10,610
you know,
I would have preferred to have broadcast

2140
01:49:10,611 --> 01:49:14,570
as widely known what I want all the 
Peterson haters to come in.

2141
01:49:14,830 --> 01:49:18,590
I want you to have a chance to be able 
to actually face to face,

2142
01:49:18,980 --> 01:49:21,770
confront what you're afraid of.
Don't be ignorant,

2143
01:49:21,771 --> 01:49:25,050
don't just impose your own beliefs and 
your biases and everything onto what you

2144
01:49:25,051 --> 01:49:25,884
were saying,
but actually hear process and come to a 

2145
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:32,000
reality and fact based conclusion about 
the things that you're trying to promote

2146
01:49:32,240 --> 01:49:33,073
because in today's society,
truly everything you've been talking 

2147
01:49:34,791 --> 01:49:36,530
about,
I don't think it's like verbally.

2148
01:49:36,590 --> 01:49:38,420
I think that we are going down a 
dangerous path.

2149
01:49:38,421 --> 01:49:39,254
We're seeing the consequences of it.
And I've been in all my students know 

2150
01:49:41,931 --> 01:49:44,510
this.
I have been promoting this in therapy.

2151
01:49:44,830 --> 01:49:46,820
Uh,
anything like glasses and my family,

2152
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:47,853
this idea that you need to be able to 
expose yourself to things that make you 

2153
01:49:50,411 --> 01:49:52,420
uncomfortable,
that you're not aware of.

2154
01:49:52,570 --> 01:49:53,520
And that's,
yeah,

2155
01:49:53,530 --> 01:49:56,500
that's kind of a ground rule of good.
It might be

2156
01:49:58,030 --> 01:50:00,940
psychotherapy speaking,
I'm being honest,

2157
01:50:01,450 --> 01:50:02,700
honest about yourself,
honestly.

2158
01:50:02,701 --> 01:50:03,680
What your biases,
your,

2159
01:50:03,690 --> 01:50:05,680
your ignorance and your fears,
your,

2160
01:50:05,681 --> 01:50:08,350
your flaws.
You can't grow without that.

2161
01:50:08,351 --> 01:50:12,820
So this to me was a metaphorical,
a metaphoric of the,

2162
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:15,160
I guess,
manifestation of that desire.

2163
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:18,310
I wanted to bring you here and I really 
do appreciate you taking the time.

2164
01:50:18,311 --> 01:50:20,440
I know you've got many speaking 
engagements.

2165
01:50:20,770 --> 01:50:21,603
I do appreciate that and I'm glad that 
some people have very pointed questions 

2166
01:50:25,130 --> 01:50:27,970
that you're able to address.
What are they going to do with a video?

2167
01:50:27,971 --> 01:50:29,960
What's the for that?
Um,

2168
01:50:31,130 --> 01:50:33,400
uh,
being very low in conscientiousness.

2169
01:50:33,401 --> 01:50:38,401
I haven't thought that far ahead.
Going dropbox and you look.

2170
01:50:38,430 --> 01:50:39,760
Well,
I'll definitely give you the uh,

2171
01:50:40,090 --> 01:50:42,280
lots of people will watch it.
So great.

2172
01:50:42,290 --> 01:50:44,860
It doesn't matter that that's the thing 
that's cool about youtube.

2173
01:50:45,730 --> 01:50:48,670
We will have you have a stadium stadium 
now.

2174
01:50:48,671 --> 01:50:50,230
Every time I talk,
which is weird,

2175
01:50:50,231 --> 01:50:51,064
man,
it's

2176
01:50:52,710 --> 01:50:55,910
going to be uploading it and send it to 
you and we'll make the arrangements.

2177
01:50:55,950 --> 01:50:58,600
So thank you very much again for coming 
and thank you everybody for [inaudible].

2178
01:51:00,060 --> 01:51:05,060
Thank you.
