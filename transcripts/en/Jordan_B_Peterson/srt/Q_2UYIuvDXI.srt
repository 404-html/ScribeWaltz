1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,253
Okay.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,393
So the last time that we met,
we talked about the idea of logos 

3
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:21,231
operating on chaos in order to to bring 
being into being.

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,750
And that's predicated on a worldview 
that

5
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,990
it's not precisely materialistic and its
fundamental orientation.

6
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:41,991
So it's predicated on a view point that 
one way of looking at being is that it's

7
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:45,060
a,
a place of potential,

8
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,063
maybe have unlimited potential.
And what acts on that potential too to 

9
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:55,620
bring it into being is what modern 
people would call consciousness.

10
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:56,454
But what the ancients called logos,
which I actually think is a better word 

11
00:00:59,131 --> 00:00:59,964
than consciousness.
I think it's a more encompassing word 

12
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,953
because it doesn't only involve the act 
of being there so to speak like the 

13
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:12,630
existentialists would say,
but it also involves active exploration,

14
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:13,973
both both physical and imagine stick as 
well as communication about the results 

15
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:19,404
of that exploration.
And I think that it's perfectly 

16
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:22,944
reasonable to face the world as if what 
you're facing is a pool of potential 

17
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:28,854
that you are capable of shaping.
And then the question is into what do 

18
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,530
you wish to shape it?

19
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,960
And I think that's actually the ultimate
question.

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,513
You know,
people often ask questions like what is 

21
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:43,410
the meaning of life?
And I actually think to some degree that

22
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:44,244
that's an ill posed question.
I think that you can observe the many 

23
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:50,940
meanings of life.
Some of them are negative,

24
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:51,983
no one questions their reality.
And some of them are positive and we're 

25
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:54,894
more likely to question the reality of 
the positive meetings that manifest 

26
00:01:58,081 --> 00:01:58,914
themselves.
Because we get overwhelmed with our 

27
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:04,410
apprehension of the fact that life is 
tragic and that we're finite in mortal.

28
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,590
But that doesn't mean that those 
meanings aren't real.

29
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,390
Okay.

30
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,680
I would also say that

31
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,633
as I've considered more and more 
carefully the way that value structures 

32
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:17,624
might be hierarchically organized and on
farther and farther out to what I think 

33
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:22,154
of as the edge or the ultimate reaches 
of that hierarchical organization that 

34
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,500
you know,
your,

35
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,363
your,
your identity as a finite individual 

36
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,020
being sort of localized in time and 
space.

37
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:33,883
Now in here,
that that encapsulates generally what 

38
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:40,580
people think about themselves as,
as,

39
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,683
as real individuals,
but that there are metaphysical spaces 

40
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,960
outside of that that are,
they're hyper real in some sense.

41
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:48,794
And in one of those metaphysical spaces,
you're the embodiment of nature and 

42
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:57,461
culture in in the most real of senses 
and in an in a metaphysical space that's

43
00:02:58,671 --> 00:02:59,770
just beyond that.

44
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,763
Yeah.

45
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,160
You're the logos that transforms order 
into chaos and sometimes the reverse and

46
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:12,490
then outside of that,
which I think is in some sense the final

47
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,290
metaphysical domain.
The question is what is it exactly is it

48
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:18,124
that you're up to?
And I think that what you should be up 

49
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:21,304
to is the attempt to transform being 
into something resembling classical 

50
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,703
conceptualizations of paradise.
And that has nothing to do with the 

51
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,144
attempt to impose an ideological 
structure on the world so that you can 

52
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:37,180
bring it into alignment with your a 
priori convictions.

53
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,650
That's not the right answer.
The right answer is something different.

54
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,513
I mean,
one of the things you want to ask 

55
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:44,940
yourself is,
you know,

56
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,670
is it better to work for the abolition 
of misery or for its extension?

57
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,360
We try to think in some senses the 
fundamental metaphysical question.

58
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,463
I think that was posed properly in the 
20th century because we learned at that 

59
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,650
point exactly how far we could push.

60
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,050
Okay,

61
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,010
voluntary evil without bringing 
everything to a halt.

62
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,370
And I think we pushed it right to the 
limit and you know,

63
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:10,110
maybe we're still not done with that 
game.

64
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:12,870
It's hard to say,
but things look like they have improved.

65
00:04:12,871 --> 00:04:16,740
I would say overall since 1989 since the
Berlin wall fell down,

66
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:17,574
although you certainly see signs of 
recidivism frequently and you see that 

67
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:22,590
right now,
for example,

68
00:04:22,591 --> 00:04:26,850
in the,
in Russia now the Russians are trying to

69
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,150
find their own way and there are afraid 
in many ways of western individuality.

70
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:37,920
They believe that it's got a fatally 
nihilistic element and that one of that,

71
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:38,754
that one of the consequences of that 
nihilistic element will be the undoing 

72
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,550
of everything that culture has produced.
It's of any value.

73
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,953
And so the main Russian political 
philosopher at this point who's one of 

74
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:53,520
potents advisers is a,
he's a nationalist of sorts.

75
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,073
But

76
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,153
yeah,

77
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,023
the reason I'm telling you that is 
because the ideological conflict that 

78
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,560
began in the 20th century is by no means
over.

79
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:03,394
And it isn't obvious that liberal 
individualism constitutes the final 

80
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:12,110
solution to the problems of mankind.
No,

81
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,400
that's not,
I'm not saying that.

82
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,530
I'm not saying that as a cynic because

83
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,220
yeah,

84
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,650
as far as systems go,
it's a pretty damn good system.

85
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,030
But I think that people in the west 
still suffer from a spiritual sickness.

86
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:24,864
That's not,
that's a consequence of what needs she 

87
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:27,624
outlined and Dostoyevsky outlined as the
major philosophical moves of the 19th 

88
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:33,994
century.
And that was the demolition of 

89
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:39,070
metaphysical belief by rationalism and 
empiricism,

90
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,933
some of which was fully justified and 
some of which I think was an 

91
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:46,000
overextension of the emergent forms of 
knowledge.

92
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,543
Yeah.

93
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,393
So I'm going to go through the rest of 
Genesis today and explain to you what I 

94
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:57,410
think it means and then I'm going to 
tell you why I think that's relevant.

95
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:58,244
And so this is an extension of the 
stories that we've been talking about 

96
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:03,610
during the entirety of the course.
Um,

97
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,280
we talked last time about the fact that,

98
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:08,810
okay,

99
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,643
in the second genesis story,
God takes eve out of Adam and what that 

100
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:15,164
might mean.
And the idea there is that it's 

101
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:21,854
something like the feminine or material 
world has to be transposed into 

102
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:28,310
something that's symbolically masculine.
In order for it to become

103
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,273
properly oriented.
So the idea in some sense is that human 

104
00:06:33,491 --> 00:06:34,870
beings,
not just women,

105
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:35,704
but human beings in general,
have to rise above their material 

106
00:06:38,321 --> 00:06:39,154
substrate and transform themselves at a 
psychological level or at the level of 

107
00:06:42,461 --> 00:06:45,160
consciousness.
And that that's actually a real level.

108
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,593
And if you accept,
accept the presupposition that 

109
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:49,024
consciousness is actually an active 
agent in the extraction of order from 

110
00:06:52,031 --> 00:06:54,760
chaos or in the extraction of reality 
from potential,

111
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,460
there's no reason to,
to delegate consciousness to a empathy,

112
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,240
phenomenal to,
to the,

113
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,950
to the status of something that's 
empathy.

114
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:03,784
Nominal,
even though it seems to depend on the 

115
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:05,944
existence of a material substrate for 
its manifestation now requires a 

116
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:13,990
different way of thinking.
Okay.

117
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,870
So we're going to start with the idea of
the garden and the Lord.

118
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:19,704
God took the man and put him in the 
garden of Eden to dress it and to keep 

119
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:26,064
it.

120
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,793
Now,
what appears to me to be happening in 

121
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:29,834
this story is the f now this is multiple
stories that have been edited together 

122
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:33,944
over a very long period of time.
And so people had evolved in some sense 

123
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:39,254
their own traditions of,
of accounting for the structure of 

124
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:42,074
reality.
And then when people came together in 

125
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:45,650
their tribal groups to make 
civilizations that were larger,

126
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,783
it was necessary for the people who were
working at an intellectual level in 

127
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:54,950
those cultures or at the level of 
storytelling to try to determine what to

128
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:58,490
do with these old stories so that the 
core truths could be retained.

129
00:07:58,491 --> 00:07:59,324
And the apparent paradox is ironed out.
And that happened continually as the 

130
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:04,700
Bible was written.
It's,

131
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,543
it's an ongoing process.
It certainly is not something that 

132
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:11,030
stopped yet.
And so it's an attempt in some sense,

133
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:11,864
to bring the story of mankind together 
into one place and to make it 

134
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,690
comprehensible,
to turn it into a comprehensible literal

135
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:18,524
narrative.

136
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,530
Um,
the idea that that's associated.

137
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,393
Like if you look at the standard Marxist
and psychoanalytic critiques of the 

138
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:26,354
religious process,
I think that they radically 

139
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,040
underestimate the fundamental utility 
and power of the underlying process.

140
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,124
Because you can become cynical about it 
and talk about it in terms of the 

141
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:38,870
imposition of a superstitious belief 
system.

142
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:41,850
And you can talk about it in terms of 
class struggle and patriarchy and,

143
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,640
and all of those things.
But I,

144
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:44,474
and I,
I think that those are valid in so far 

145
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:49,370
as everything that human beings do,
our arc,

146
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,593
everything's,
all of the things that human beings do 

147
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:52,964
are contaminated with those motives.
But I think it's a dreadful mistake to 

148
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:56,574
write off the entire rhe entire 
metaphysical history of mankind by 

149
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:02,304
attributing it,
by attributing its existence to some 

150
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:07,930
cause and then to make that cause 
something that cynical and,

151
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,120
and destructive.

152
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,240
I think it's extremely dangerous.
And I think by doing that,

153
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:15,360
we risk losing what we actually need to 
survive.

154
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,520
Because I think that the sorts of things
that,

155
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,440
that the metaphysical speculations that 
are buried in religious systems teach us

156
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:25,540
are there are absolutely vital.
You cannot live properly without,

157
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,903
you'll become destructive or,
or suffer from some variety of serious 

158
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:32,790
existential metaphysical or mental 
illness.

159
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,223
I mean,
I've certainly observed in my clinical 

160
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:37,950
practice that one of the major 
contributors to mental illness,

161
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:39,360
it's certainly not the only one,
but,

162
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,410
and a physical illness is the tendency 
for people to deceive and betrayed.

163
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,580
Other.
In fact,

164
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:45,414
I don't think there is any factor that 
plays itself out in human interactions 

165
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:52,050
that has more of a causal connection 
with what we describe as mental illness,

166
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,230
that then tendency of people to lie to 
each other and betray each other.

167
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,573
And one of the things that's really 
shocking and surprising to me as a 

168
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,364
clinician is that those sorts of things 
are almost never considered as factors 

169
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:06,960
in the etl etiology of mental illness.
So you know,

170
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:07,794
when you talk to someone in 
psychotherapy and you're trying to 

171
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:12,450
straighten out their lives,
basically what you're trying to do is to

172
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:17,451
replace falsehood with truth.
Now it isn't like you do that by telling

173
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:18,414
the person what the truth is and having 
them accept that as some sort of final 

174
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:22,464
ideological statement.
What you do instead is engaged with the 

175
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:29,580
person in a form of dialogue that's 
designed to help them understand exactly

176
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:30,414
what it was that happened and why it 
happened and what was good about it and 

177
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:37,050
what wasn't good about it and how the 
things that we're good could continue to

178
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:37,884
manifest themselves in the future and 
maybe to manifest themselves more 

179
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:41,754
powerfully and more strongly and more 
comprehensively in the future then they 

180
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:45,270
had in the past.

181
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:46,973
And as far as I can tell,
that's basically what you're doing in 

182
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,314
psychotherapy.
And I think all the evidence points in 

183
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,970
that direction.
And I think you can do it for yourself.

184
00:10:53,971 --> 00:10:56,460
I mean one of the things that young said
about psychotherapy,

185
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,593
about psychoanalytic psychotherapy was 
that it could be replaced by a 

186
00:11:00,481 --> 00:11:05,481
sufficient moral effort.
So okay,

187
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:09,690
so what happens is that once God makes 
man and woman,

188
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:14,430
so what that means in some sense is that
once the logo's is embodied in something

189
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:15,264
that's in something that's flash,
a place for that to be has to be 

190
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:20,460
established.
And so you might say,

191
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:21,810
well,
what is the,

192
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,300
this is the narcan simple story.
So the question is,

193
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:25,134
well,
what is the architectural nature of 

194
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:28,020
humanity?
The essential nature?

195
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,470
And the story says,
the essential nature of humanity is that

196
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:32,304
we are logos closed in flesh.
And I think that that's in court in 

197
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,040
accordance with people's own subjective 
experience.

198
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,113
I believe that's how we experience the 
world because we s we see ourselves and 

199
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:42,804
perceive ourselves as conscious beings 
who are capable of transforming 

200
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:49,830
potential into reality and that were 
clothed,

201
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,693
embodied in something that's mortal and 
corruptible and partly the opportunity 

202
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:58,090
of existence and partly it's peril and 
burden.

203
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,850
And then the question,
and this is actually the question that's

204
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:05,851
posed in the story of Adam and Eve,
is what then can be done about that?

205
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,590
What are the consequences of that and 
what can be done about it?

206
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:11,430
And I think that the biblical writings 
take it in as a,

207
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,573
as a comprehensive unit are an attempt,
are the attempt or one of the prime 

208
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:17,464
attempts of mankind to sort out that 
question and answer it over a period of 

209
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,620
thousands and thousands and thousands of
years.

210
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,293
So,
so the first idea is that we're made in 

211
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:29,044
the image of God and that what God is is
the thing that extracted order from 

212
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:34,390
chaos at the beginning of time and that 
we can,

213
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,343
that we partake in that and embody that 
as we move through life and that we can 

214
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,603
choose how to turn potential into 
actuality and that we actually choose 

215
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,790
what kind of reality the potential will 
be turned into.

216
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,313
I think that part of the reason that 
many cultures have the idea of heaven 

217
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:50,884
and hell as well as the idea of the 
underworld is that the archetipal 

218
00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:00,270
potential poles for the transformation 
of potentiality are heaven and hell.

219
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,370
If things went as badly as they possibly
could,

220
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:04,204
we could turn the,
we could turn being itself to something 

221
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:10,480
that as closely enough resembles hell.
So there's no reason to figure,

222
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,450
there's no reason to assume that there's
any distinction whatsoever.

223
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,880
And I think we've had a good taste of 
that.

224
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:18,100
We had a very good taste of that in the 
20th century.

225
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,370
And on the opposite pole is whatever we 
could do,

226
00:13:21,371 --> 00:13:25,150
if we made things as good as they could 
possibly be now,

227
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,060
I think in order to make things as good 
as they possibly can be,

228
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:30,700
you have to abandon your fear and your 
resentment.

229
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:32,890
And there's lots of reasons why people 
can't do that.

230
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,723
And some of the primary reasons have to 
do with the fact of are the nature of 

231
00:13:36,701 --> 00:13:38,410
our being itself,
which is that we're,

232
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,633
we're conscious cocreators of reality,
but were invalid in a corruptible 

233
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:47,290
envelope and that's painful and 
frightening and,

234
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,403
and in some sense of sufficient mystery 
to undermine our faith in the entire 

235
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:55,060
process.
I mean,

236
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:56,680
then that happens to people all the 
time,

237
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,650
especially when they get sick or when 
things really go badly for them.

238
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,821
They wonder,
you know,

239
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:01,654
what's the point?
Or I was talking to one of my clients 

240
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:04,264
the other day about Ivan in the brothers
Karamozov and I don't know if you've 

241
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:09,370
read the brothers Karamazov,
but you definitely should.

242
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,900
It's an amazing book in that book.
There's a no novice,

243
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:17,410
a monastery novice named a Losha and he 
has an older brother named Ivan.

244
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,453
And Alicia isn't very verbal,
but he's a very good person and he's 

245
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:22,414
trying his best to be divine,
I suppose to be devout and to become a 

246
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:25,990
monk.

247
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,823
But his older brother who's 
extraordinarily intelligent and 

248
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:31,210
charismatic is a rationalist right to 
the core.

249
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:34,690
And he likes to torment a Losha with all
the reasons why.

250
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,930
Believing in some kind of divine reality
is weak,

251
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:39,770
naive and,
and uh,

252
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,270
ill advised.
And basically he tells,

253
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:46,840
he continually tells him stories about 
horrible things that happen in the world

254
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,320
and attempts to force your Losha to 
justify how if being is good,

255
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:54,140
those things could possibly occur.
It.

256
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:56,240
So one of the stories he tells the low 
Hsa,

257
00:14:56,241 --> 00:15:00,560
which is a story that Dostoyevsky got 
from the newspapers of the time,

258
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:03,960
was that it's a story about a little 
girl whose parents locked her in and out

259
00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:06,470
house overnight when it was like 
freezing outside.

260
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,333
And she screamed and cried the entire 
night because she was locked out there 

261
00:15:10,971 --> 00:15:13,640
and eventually froze to death.
And that became quite a,

262
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,160
you know,
a scandal in Russia at that time.

263
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,420
And Ivan's basic comment Losha was that 
as far as he was concerned,

264
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:21,254
the entire course of being up to this 
point in time wasn't worth that girls 

265
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,233
suffering that night.
And that there was no way that that 

266
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:29,084
could be justified by man nor beast and 
in and fall under the rubric of the 

267
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:36,260
assumption that,
you know,

268
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:39,710
being was good and that what all 
whatever created it was also good.

269
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,830
And so why even is very good at laying 
out stories like that.

270
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,053
And you know,
I losha has a very difficult time 

271
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:49,670
dealing with it and I think Dostoyevsky 
had his finger on exactly the problem.

272
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,710
You want me to just like if,
if,

273
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,320
if life has some sort of transcendent 
meaning,

274
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,540
then why is it pervaded by suffering and
evil?

275
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,403
That's basically the question that 
people have been asking since the 

276
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:02,510
beginning of time.
Um,

277
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,870
my,
my impression of the ad,

278
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:06,704
my,
my feeling about that is that it's a 

279
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:09,284
work in progress so to speak and the 
things might be as good as they can be 

280
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:15,590
because no one has figured out how to 
make them any better than they are.

281
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,450
No,
I mean that,

282
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,820
that fault flies in the face of ideas 
of,

283
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:20,763
you know,
the classical ideas of God or that God 

284
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:23,420
is omniscient,
omnipotent,

285
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:26,750
omnipresent and um,
I always forget the other one.

286
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:28,611
Yes.
Right.

287
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:30,710
So the,
the classic attributes of God it is that

288
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:33,700
he has all the power there is,
and then of course the question is,

289
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,860
is if that's the case,
then why are things such a mess?

290
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,083
You know,
when there's been various attempts to 

291
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,330
address that in the history of 
metaphysical and philosophical thought.

292
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:47,440
And one is that they're very,
they live,

293
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,200
they vary in degrees of complexity.
But one is that,

294
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,423
you know,
the world is set up such that human 

295
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:54,574
beings have to find their own way.
That we have a role to play in this in 

296
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,280
some sense.
Although God could fix it if,

297
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,390
if he wished.
The other reason that there was a,

298
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,560
something went wrong near the beginning 
of time when when people became,

299
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:09,394
or at least the beginning of human time 
when people became self conscious and 

300
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:15,190
that it's never been rectified.
And the other is,

301
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,350
and this is how it appears to me,
is that

302
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,733
yeah,

303
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,890
it's something that has to be worked out
as time progresses,

304
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,180
that the nature of perfection can't be 
predetermined.

305
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:37,140
It's too complex.
And so in some sense that the whole,

306
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,243
that being itself is,
it is an attempt to compute the perfect 

307
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:42,324
final solution,
but that no one knows what that is and 

308
00:17:44,911 --> 00:17:47,280
that you can't compute it without 
running it as a simulation.

309
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,650
It's something like that.
And then we in that,

310
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,484
and I believe that every time people 
make a choice that the choice that you 

311
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:59,841
make is between tilting the world war,
tilting the world in the direction whose

312
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:01,104
final destination would be something 
resembling hell or tilting the world in 

313
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:07,560
a direction whose final destination 
would be something approximating heaven.

314
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,730
And that you're always making that 
decision and that you actually know that

315
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:12,564
you're making that decision,
that you make it consciously at that 

316
00:18:14,341 --> 00:18:17,880
point in time.
And so I think then part of the,

317
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,970
the,
the moral duty of people is to put their

318
00:18:20,971 --> 00:18:21,804
lives together so that they're 
sufficiently without arrogance and 

319
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:26,910
sufficiently without resentment.

320
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:27,743
So that every time they make a choice,
they choose to push things in the right 

321
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:32,640
direction,
that they're not vengeful and,

322
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,940
and angry and they're not out for 
destruction and,

323
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,163
and,
uh,

324
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,480
um,
revenge.

325
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,421
You know,
and,

326
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:42,254
and the part of the reason that I've 
come to this solution is because I've 

327
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:48,300
read what people who are extremely 
destructive think.

328
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,301
You know,
and I,

329
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:51,134
I you,
you can find those writings in various 

330
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:53,454
places,
some of the most illuminating forms of 

331
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:56,670
those writings.
I saw for example,

332
00:18:56,671 --> 00:18:57,504
in the writings of the kid who shot up 
the columbine high school and like he 

333
00:19:00,421 --> 00:19:03,600
tells you exactly what he was thinking.
It's very,

334
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,580
very clear and it's completely 
metaphysical.

335
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:07,470
He explains it didn't religious 
language.

336
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,603
He basically says that the world has 
presently constituted it has is so evil 

337
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:15,130
and so rife with suffering,
uh,

338
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,480
including all of humanity that it would 
be better if it was just wiped out.

339
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,820
And that's what he proceeds to try to 
do.

340
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:21,871
You know?
And,

341
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:22,704
and his,
his viewpoint is of course contaminated 

342
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:25,524
by the fact that he places himself not 
only above all other people but above 

343
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:32,040
God himself and then proceeds to be the 
judge and executioner.

344
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,700
And I don't see how you can read what he
said and not come to that conclusion.

345
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,930
That's just exactly what he says.
And the,

346
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,840
the connection between that and the,
the,

347
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,913
the nature of the satanic impulse to 
rationally dominate and destroy are so 

348
00:19:51,211 --> 00:19:52,044
close that they could be,
they could've been formulated by the 

349
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:56,670
same thinker.
And in some sense,

350
00:19:56,671 --> 00:19:57,504
I think they were.
So now when God makes man and a woman 

351
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:03,844
that,
a couple of things we talked about last 

352
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:05,934
time that I think are extremely 
interesting is that despite that the 

353
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,653
fact that this book is so ancient,
one of the propositions that it 

354
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:15,270
formulates is that both men and women 
are formulated in the image of God,

355
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,800
which I think is quite remarkable.

356
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,120
One of the things you always hear with 
regards to,

357
00:20:19,121 --> 00:20:19,954
especially to radical feminist thought,
which is something that I am I think is 

358
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:24,114
destructive beyond comprehension,
is that prior to the emergence of 

359
00:20:28,381 --> 00:20:29,214
feminist thinking,
the entire structure of humanity was 

360
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:33,900
basically patriarchal and aimed at 
oppressing women.

361
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,573
And I don't think you can.
And that was a certainly the case for 

362
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,160
religious traditions like the,
like the great monotheisms,

363
00:20:41,161 --> 00:20:41,994
but I don't think that you can read 
genesis and come to that conclusion 

364
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:44,934
because one of the first statements is 
that both men and women are divided in 

365
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:49,624
their fundamental essence.
And that is by no means of patriarchal 

366
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:53,494
statement.
I think it's actually a miraculous 

367
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:55,534
statement in some sense that that idea 
could have been formulated so early in 

368
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:00,004
time.
And I think that says more about the 

369
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,093
true nature of the historical 
relationship between men and women than 

370
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,633
any attempt to rewrite history across 
somebody illogical using some 

371
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:12,850
ideological,
a priority idiot logical format.

372
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,750
So men and women are both created and 
then they're created in the nae,

373
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,050
in the image of God,
whatever that means.

374
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,483
I think it means that they have the 
capacity to turn possibility into 

375
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:25,174
actuality and that that's built into our
being and then they're placed in the 

376
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:30,100
garden.
Now the idea of a garden is a very,

377
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:33,280
very complicated idea because the garden
of Eden is,

378
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,383
is a particular type of place and what 
it seems to me to be is that the story 

379
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:41,950
is not only are describing archetipal 
what men and women are,

380
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,993
but it's also describing archetipal Lee 
what the environment of men and women 

381
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:51,100
has to be and the environment has to be 
a garden and a walled garden.

382
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,990
An Eden means well watered place in para
days.

383
00:21:53,991 --> 00:21:56,560
I means Paradise Means Wald,
Wald,

384
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,450
guard.
And so the,

385
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,523
the idea that the idea that the semantic
indicators point to is that the proper 

386
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,223
place for human beings is a place that's
a combination of culture and nature 

387
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,633
because the walls are there to protect 
and to keep in and to keep out where's 

388
00:22:13,991 --> 00:22:16,180
the garden itself is the,
you know,

389
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:17,014
the,
the flourishing of nature in some 

390
00:22:18,491 --> 00:22:19,540
independent manner.

391
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,090
Well also under the,
um,

392
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,840
what under the conscious apprehension 
and shaping of the,

393
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,540
of the inhabitants of that particular 
place.

394
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,943
And I think that that's part of what 
human beings are struggling with right 

395
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:35,170
now.
We're in the 21st century and a big part

396
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:37,420
of what faces us is,
well,

397
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,870
it appears that we have the ability 
whether we want it or not,

398
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:41,883
to shape the manner in which the entire 
planet manifest itself over the next 

399
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,450
endless span of time.
And we're,

400
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,284
we're caught at the moment trying to 
decide exactly what that should look 

401
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:55,990
like and whether we want the 
responsibility or not.

402
00:22:55,991 --> 00:22:58,610
It seems to be honest.
And I would say that since it's on us,

403
00:22:58,611 --> 00:22:59,444
we should wake up and take the 
responsibility because the thing will 

404
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:02,734
deteriorate of its own accord.
And that means we have difficult 

405
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:06,394
decisions to make.
And at the moment we're mostly fighting 

406
00:23:08,381 --> 00:23:09,214
about who's bad and who's good within 
that entire struggle and looking for 

407
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:16,060
people to blame about why it's not as 
perfect as it could be.

408
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,850
It's like there's a lot of reasons it's 
not as perfect as it could be.

409
00:23:18,851 --> 00:23:21,760
And I think that one of the most 
fundamental reasons is that none of your

410
00:23:21,761 --> 00:23:23,710
lives or as perfect as you could make 
them.

411
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,263
And so because of that,
you're not in any position to make the 

412
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:30,880
appropriate decisions that would have to
be made in order to set the world on its

413
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:34,960
proper course because it's a very 
complicated set of decisions.

414
00:23:34,961 --> 00:23:35,794
And that if you make a mistake because 
you're ideologically predisposed or 

415
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:42,250
because your life is full of deceit and 
and inadequacy,

416
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:44,350
all of which you could conceivably 
addressed,

417
00:23:44,351 --> 00:23:45,184
then why would,
do you think that you would be reliable 

418
00:23:46,881 --> 00:23:49,820
enough to make the kind of decisions 
that would set things right?

419
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,270
It's very,
very complicated and you know,

420
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:54,104
if we want to put the world in order,
we're going to have to extend our 

421
00:23:57,141 --> 00:24:00,560
capacity tremendously because we're just
not up to the task at the moment.

422
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:05,270
It's not only that people won't do it,
it's not only that people actively fight

423
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:06,104
against making things better.
It's also that we just don't know what 

424
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:13,700
to do and it's a massive problem.
So,

425
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,253
and I don't believe that it's a problem 
that you can solve unless you put your 

426
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:18,314
own house together to begin with because
I don't think that you have the 

427
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,643
psychological sophistication or the 
spiritual stability to begin to address 

428
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:26,054
such issues before you are standing on 
firm ground firm ground that you've 

429
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:30,854
placed beneath your own feet and it's no
simple matter to get your own life 

430
00:24:34,101 --> 00:24:34,934
together and then it's no simple matter 
to get your own life together while 

431
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:38,384
you're similar caneously getting your 
family's life together and then there's 

432
00:24:41,151 --> 00:24:41,984
you and your family and your community 
and all those things have to be brought 

433
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:48,080
into harmony.
One of the things that I've been very,

434
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:52,520
very impressed with over the years is is
piaget's idea of and equilibrated state.

435
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,863
I think that that's,
I think that that's the appropriate 

436
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,194
paradisical vision.
Now what piaget basically said was that 

437
00:25:00,051 --> 00:25:00,884
it was possible to set up complex 
systems so that they were voluntarily 

438
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:04,484
self sustaining and so across,
so at voluntarily self sustaining would 

439
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:09,224
mean self sustaining.
Now they would mean self sustaining for 

440
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,110
you it would,
it means self sustaining for you and the

441
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:15,944
people around you.
It would mean self sustaining for you 

442
00:25:18,021 --> 00:25:20,180
and the people around you.
Now next week,

443
00:25:20,181 --> 00:25:21,014
next month,
the year after that and then across 

444
00:25:22,851 --> 00:25:23,684
multiple spans of time and there's a 
kind of a harmonious balance that that 

445
00:25:27,081 --> 00:25:31,340
implies that I think you have to build 
from the bottom up because it's too damn

446
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:33,590
complicated.
Otherwise you just don't,

447
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,603
you just don't know what the appropriate
next step would be and that and the 

448
00:25:38,511 --> 00:25:42,980
ability to determine what the next step 
would be requires certain fundamentals.

449
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,933
It requires certain fundamental skills,
skills that have to be brought to bear 

450
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:50,750
on the problem in order to solve the 
problem.

451
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,790
One of them would be,
if you and I,

452
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:53,624
for example,
want to sit together and determine how 

453
00:25:55,251 --> 00:25:57,950
to establish and equilibrated space 
right here and now,

454
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,053
one of the things that we have to do is 
we have to be able to listen to each 

455
00:26:01,671 --> 00:26:02,504
other and we may have to be able to 
listen to each other in such a way that 

456
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:10,370
I,
if I happen to be better at articulating

457
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:11,204
myself than you are,
then I have to lend you my skills of 

458
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:17,540
articulation to help you understand what
you want so that we can actually discuss

459
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,440
how we could mutually obtain our,
our,

460
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,770
our individual goals simultaneously in 
the same space.

461
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,410
It's very complicated,
you know?

462
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:30,200
And that would also mean that you have 
to know what you want.

463
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,780
And I think that in order for you to 
know what you want,

464
00:26:32,781 --> 00:26:35,810
you have to know who you are.
And if you have to know who you are,

465
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:37,700
that means you also have to know who you
are.

466
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:39,500
All right.
All the way down to the,

467
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,230
you know,
to the bottom of the demonic side,

468
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,310
which is no easy thing to do

469
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,600
because it's,
it's,

470
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,670
it's bottomless Lee,
terrible.

471
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,713
But if you don't take it into account,
then what you have is an equilibrated 

472
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:51,864
solution that's unstable and naive and 
that's not going to be helpful because 

473
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:59,790
the parts of you that you haven't called
in to the table so to speak,

474
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,340
are going to rebel and cause all sorts 
of trouble.

475
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:07,170
And so to some degree that means that 
you have to make peace with this side of

476
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:08,004
you.
That's,

477
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,180
that's,
that's,

478
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:10,523
uh,
predatory and destructive in order to 

479
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:14,274
bring that element into the discussion 
so that it can be incorporated into the 

480
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:20,820
solution that's going to propagate it 
across time.

481
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:21,923
And you know,
you might think these are metaphysical 

482
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:24,750
considerations and that they're very 
abstract,

483
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:26,670
but I can tell you they're not.
When,

484
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:27,504
when,
when you people set up your intimate 

485
00:27:29,101 --> 00:27:30,930
relationships with one another,
you know,

486
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,033
your,
your,

487
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,620
your marriages,
we'll say for the time being,

488
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,930
okay.

489
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:36,763
Unless you,
it managed to incorporate the elements 

490
00:27:39,021 --> 00:27:42,470
of your own psyche that are aggressive 
and sexually demanding.

491
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,453
Let's say you're not going to set up a 
marriage that is the least bit 

492
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:51,641
satisfying or stable and it isn't 
obvious at all how monstrous an awful,

493
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:56,390
both the husband and the wife have to be
across time so that they find each other

494
00:27:56,391 --> 00:27:57,224
mutually satisfying.
But the idea that you can live as you 

495
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:02,264
know,
naive persona together happily over any 

496
00:28:04,911 --> 00:28:05,744
length of time is completely absurd.
It just will not happen because the 

497
00:28:08,511 --> 00:28:09,344
parts of you that are deeply animalistic
and powerful are going to go off and 

498
00:28:13,341 --> 00:28:17,870
have their own adventure at times when 
you win for you,

499
00:28:17,871 --> 00:28:20,480
it's going to be the least convenient.

500
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:21,970
Okay,

501
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,490
so,
so back to the garden.

502
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,353
Well,
the garden seems to be something like 

503
00:28:26,261 --> 00:28:28,600
the optimal balance of nature and 
culture.

504
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,943
And so the,
the genesis story is offering the 

505
00:28:32,441 --> 00:28:33,274
proposition that the proper environment 
for human beings is actually partly 

506
00:28:37,631 --> 00:28:40,660
constructed and partly spontaneous.
Right?

507
00:28:40,661 --> 00:28:42,400
And that is what a garden is like,
right?

508
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:47,401
Because a garden does what it wants to 
do and it's also the product of billions

509
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:50,080
of years of evolution.
But when you're in the garden,

510
00:28:50,081 --> 00:28:50,914
you're tending it and shaping it and 
protecting it and walling it in so that 

511
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,073
you get the advantages of the,
of the spontaneity that the natural 

512
00:28:59,351 --> 00:29:00,184
world can produce along with the 
intelligent and judicious order that 

513
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:07,690
heightened consciousness and attention 
can bring to the situation.

514
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,093
And so the story basically says that the
human environment is half constructed 

515
00:29:12,641 --> 00:29:16,270
and half natural.
And that seems to me to be approximately

516
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:19,090
correct.
I mean we are cultural creatures.

517
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:19,924
We're not going back to the jungle.
No one wants to and no wonder because 

518
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:24,634
it's full of snakes and poisonous 
spiders and you live 30 years and like 

519
00:29:28,781 --> 00:29:29,614
it's not pleasant.
So that isn't us where culture and 

520
00:29:33,581 --> 00:29:35,980
nature at the same time.
So,

521
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,250
so then the question is,
well,

522
00:29:39,251 --> 00:29:44,251
what exactly is the proper garden?
So I wrote this.

523
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:50,470
A walled garden is a productive,
natural place given order by structure.

524
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,993
That's,
it is a localized replication of the 

525
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:58,861
interplay of chaos and order.
The man who's a kenotic logos,

526
00:29:58,990 --> 00:29:59,823
there's this idea of Christianity.
It's a very strange idea because one of 

527
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:06,820
the propositions of Christianity was 
that God became man.

528
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,103
And so there's this idea that there's 
the possibility of direct unity between 

529
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:12,754
whatever the divine,
whatever the total consciousness of 

530
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:20,980
being might be at any individual person.
And one of the questions that of course,

531
00:30:20,981 --> 00:30:24,820
that particularly the Catholics tortured
themselves with as a consequence of that

532
00:30:24,821 --> 00:30:28,930
piece of doctrine was how could God 
possibly fit himself into the frame of a

533
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:32,860
human being without blowing it into,
into shattered bits.

534
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:33,694
And the basic idea that the Catholics 
came up with was that God underwent 

535
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:39,700
Kenosis,
which was a kind of emptying.

536
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,133
And so he emptied himself to the point 
where there was only enough left of him 

537
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:46,450
that he could fit inside a body without 
blowing it into pieces.

538
00:30:46,451 --> 00:30:47,284
And I think what that means in some 
sense is that the consciousness that 

539
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:53,620
each of us,
each of us has within us is a reflection

540
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:54,454
of the divine consciousness.
But it's scaled down to the point where 

541
00:30:57,491 --> 00:31:01,390
it can inhabit this sort of framework 
that we constitute without,

542
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,420
without overwhelming it,
without destroying it.

543
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,033
And so the idea is that Adam and eve are
these kinds of reduced divine 

544
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:17,020
consciousness and that they inhabit a 
microcosm of chaos and order.

545
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:21,370
So it's like a localized representation 
of the entire structure of via.

546
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,593
And I think that that's perfectly 
reasonable because I do believe that 

547
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:25,684
it's perfectly appropriate for each of 
you to assume that what you inhabit in 

548
00:31:29,231 --> 00:31:32,680
your own being is a microcosm of the 
entirety.

549
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,033
What else could it possibly be?
Especially if you take seriously the 

550
00:31:37,211 --> 00:31:39,520
proposition that what being is 
constructed of is,

551
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,503
is chaos and order.
That's what you have in front of you is 

552
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:46,450
chaos and order.
And maybe you have just the right amount

553
00:31:46,451 --> 00:31:49,900
of it in front of you so that you could 
bring it into a harmonious relationship.

554
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,410
I mean you,
you better or,

555
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,280
or your or there's going to be hell to 
pay.

556
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:59,500
So it's not like it's optional.
So what's optional is whether you accept

557
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:02,890
the responsibility of doing it.
That's what I think is optional.

558
00:32:02,891 --> 00:32:05,380
I also think that that's why people 
won't wake up.

559
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:06,873
You know,
because there's been a story throughout 

560
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:08,973
the entire history of mankind since we 
became conscious that people could wake 

561
00:32:12,551 --> 00:32:14,440
up,
they could become enlightened,

562
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,780
but they don't.
And you know,

563
00:32:16,781 --> 00:32:17,800
you,
you hear people,

564
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:18,634
especially the new age people and,
and I think they were sort of motivated 

565
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:24,460
to begin with by Joseph Campbell and 
maybe by the human potential people that

566
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,280
if you just follow your bliss,
that you could wake up.

567
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:31,600
And I think that that's,
I understand why that idea emerged.

568
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:34,210
It's,
it's a classic 1960s idea,

569
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:35,044
which is that you could have heaven with
no responsibility whatsoever just by 

570
00:32:38,711 --> 00:32:41,330
doing what felt good all the time.
You know,

571
00:32:41,331 --> 00:32:43,670
and I think there's a kernel of truth in
it.

572
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,773
But the problem with the whole idea is 
that there's no responsibility in it at 

573
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:50,390
all.
And I think that if you wake up,

574
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:54,110
the problem with waking up is that you 
have to take responsibility.

575
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,880
And then the question might be,
well,

576
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:58,130
how much responsibility do you have to 
take?

577
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,143
An answer to that might be,
it depends on how much you want to wake 

578
00:33:01,131 --> 00:33:03,920
up because if you want to wake up 
completely,

579
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:06,710
maybe then you have to take 
responsibility for the whole thing.

580
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,143
I think that's what it means.
There's this old idea in Christianity 

581
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,893
that Christ took the sins of the world 
on his shoulders and that's a very 

582
00:33:14,181 --> 00:33:15,014
strange idea and what Christianity has 
done with that idea to some degree has 

583
00:33:18,411 --> 00:33:19,244
made the proposition that because Christ
took the sins of the world on his 

584
00:33:22,371 --> 00:33:23,204
shoulders and died for us as a 
consequence that everything has been 

585
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:27,194
redeemed.

586
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,290
But the problem with that,
and this is the problem that you pointed

587
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:33,020
out when he was talking about the 
development of science from Alchemy,

588
00:33:33,021 --> 00:33:36,200
is that everything doesn't seem to have 
been redeemed.

589
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,053
There's still plenty of problems.
Part of the reason that you and believe 

590
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:41,354
that alchemy developed into science in 
Europe was because the Christian 

591
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:45,224
community realized at an unconscious 
level that the proposition that reality 

592
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:50,714
had been redeemed by the death of Christ
was an incomplete assumption because it 

593
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:54,284
didn't seem to be working.
And so there was a tremendous emphasis 

594
00:33:58,881 --> 00:34:01,190
on spiritual development and 
Christianity and,

595
00:34:01,191 --> 00:34:02,024
and the idea of the,
of the death redeeming humanity was a 

596
00:34:05,451 --> 00:34:08,750
spiritual idea,
but it left the material world behind as

597
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:13,490
something that was essentially damned 
and young's idea was that the unredeemed

598
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:17,630
material world was crying out.
And human beings,

599
00:34:17,631 --> 00:34:18,464
especially in Europe responded to that.
And the way they responded to that was 

600
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:21,974
by beginning to dream the 
transformations of the material world 

601
00:34:24,891 --> 00:34:27,350
could bring about the redeemed state.

602
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,130
And that that was the motivating dream 
that led to the emergence of science.

603
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,073
You know,
and if you don't have a better theory 

604
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:37,580
for why science emerged,
that's a pretty damn good one.

605
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:38,151
And,
you know,

606
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:40,460
young spent a lot of time trying to 
figure that out.

607
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:41,601
And uh,
you know,

608
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:44,000
it strikes me as something that's very 
much the case.

609
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,283
So maybe that part of niches commentary 
was the Christianity lost its moral 

610
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,800
forest because it,
it,

611
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,873
it,
it continually pushed paradise off to a 

612
00:34:57,741 --> 00:35:02,390
place that was beyond death and 
alleviated the responsibility of all the

613
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,224
individuals who were currently alive.
It alleviated their responsibility to 

614
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:07,934
bring it about.
And maybe that's why the whole damn 

615
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:13,370
thing came crashing down.
It's like,

616
00:35:13,371 --> 00:35:14,880
it,
it lost its moral footing.

617
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:18,650
I mean,
niches are often regarded as perhaps the

618
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:21,530
most influential antichristian who ever 
lived.

619
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:25,640
But I have always read him as a 
salutary,

620
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,310
um,
corrective.

621
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,870
You know,
if something's rotten,

622
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,033
something that goes in there and 
destroys the rod is actually it's 

623
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:34,250
friend,
not it's enemy.

624
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,713
And I think that that was the role that 
[inaudible] played in relationship to 

625
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:38,730
Christianity.

626
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,953
He thought that as soon as it had 
disappeared into some other world than 

627
00:35:42,031 --> 00:35:45,540
it had lost its moral right to exist 
because it left everything behind.

628
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,360
It's like the Buddhist doctrine that you
can attain nirvana,

629
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,520
you know,
individually.

630
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:51,354
And that's what you should be doing.
You should detach yourself from 

631
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:53,994
existence and attain Nirvana.
Existence in and of itself can go to 

632
00:35:57,331 --> 00:35:59,100
hell.
It's like it's not a very,

633
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,970
it's not a very,
uh,

634
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:02,973
yeah,

635
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,080
it's an irresponsible,
it's irresponsible doctrine.

636
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,110
You know,
Buddha himself left nervana to come back

637
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:12,300
to redeem humanity.
He decided he,

638
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:15,570
and one of his most fundamental 
temptations was the gods offered him the

639
00:36:15,571 --> 00:36:16,404
opportunity to stay in paradise and he 
left that dose so that he could come 

640
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:21,420
back,
so to speak,

641
00:36:21,421 --> 00:36:25,620
and spread his teachings around to try 
to bring everything else up to the state

642
00:36:25,621 --> 00:36:26,454
of being redeemed.
So I don't think that the idea that you 

643
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:29,694
can escape as a reasonable idea,
I think it's a running away from 

644
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:35,070
responsibility.
So

645
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,860
walled garden is a productive,
natural place given order by structure.

646
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:41,694
Thus,
it's a localized replication of the 

647
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:46,510
interplay of chaos and order.
The man who's a keynotek logos says,

648
00:36:46,511 --> 00:36:47,344
place there to inhabit and keep it the 
fact that the garden may be also a well 

649
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:51,324
watered place into meets the same water.
The primal element commonly represents 

650
00:36:55,621 --> 00:36:58,920
fertility and generative chaos.
However,

651
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:01,380
the garden itself is tended structured 
and ordered.

652
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,693
Thus,
a garden is both productive and 

653
00:37:03,811 --> 00:37:05,820
sheltered,
particularly if it is walled.

654
00:37:05,821 --> 00:37:09,840
And well-watered throughout the garden 
is a microcosm of being.

655
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,153
It is in turn the place of man,
female and male who are microcosms of 

656
00:37:14,581 --> 00:37:17,080
logos.
So I would say what,

657
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:22,120
what that story suggests is that the 
entire destiny of being itself is played

658
00:37:23,761 --> 00:37:24,594
out in a microcosmic form in the 
localized environments that every human 

659
00:37:27,721 --> 00:37:28,554
being in habits.
And I think that's a perfectly 

660
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:32,730
reasonable way of looking at it.

661
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,830
And I can't see how it could be any 
other way.

662
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,740
Next,
the garden and the tree and the Lord God

663
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:42,360
planted a garden,
eastward and Eden.

664
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:46,020
And there he put the man who even with 
whom he had formed and out of the ground

665
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:46,854
made the Lord God to grow every tree 
that is pleasant to the sight and good 

666
00:37:49,261 --> 00:37:50,094
for food,
the tree of life also in the midst of 

667
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:54,330
the garden and the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil.

668
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:59,490
Now the whole tree idea,
it's insanely complicated.

669
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:00,803
I mean,
the first thing that you might think 

670
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:02,934
about with regards to trees is that we 
spend a bloody long time in them during 

671
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:08,760
our evolutionary history,
tens of millions of years.

672
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,253
So the idea that that being is a tree 
and if there are snakes in the tree and 

673
00:38:14,971 --> 00:38:15,804
around the bottom of the tree was 
literally true for us for some tens of 

674
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:20,010
millions of years.

675
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,590
And I think I talked to you about um,
Lynn,

676
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,920
Isabelle and her hypothesis about snakes
and vision.

677
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,690
You know,
her basic answer,

678
00:38:27,691 --> 00:38:28,524
biological hypothesis is that it was the
arms race between our tree dwelling 

679
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:32,763
ancestors and predatory snakes that gave
human beings incredible vision that we 

680
00:38:36,371 --> 00:38:39,010
have.
And that's exactly the story that's laid

681
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:43,720
out in the genesis story because it's 
the snake that gives Adam and eve vision

682
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,340
and strangely enough to snake gives Adam
and eve enough vision so that the scales

683
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:49,174
fall from the rise and so that they can,
that they wake up and re and re realize 

684
00:38:52,301 --> 00:38:53,980
that they're naked.
And you know,

685
00:38:53,981 --> 00:38:58,870
that seems to me to be a story.
Imagine that we became more and more

686
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:00,920
okay

687
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,753
cognitively and attention Lee complex as
a consequence of being chased by 

688
00:39:06,801 --> 00:39:08,870
something that was evolving along with 
us.

689
00:39:08,871 --> 00:39:09,704
So that's an evolutionary arms race.
That sort of thing happens in evolution 

690
00:39:12,501 --> 00:39:15,410
all the time.
And then in order to outsmart the snake,

691
00:39:15,411 --> 00:39:18,710
we had to grow brain that was so big 
that something catastrophic happened.

692
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:19,544
And the catastrophic occurrence was that
we became so aware of the nature of 

693
00:39:23,301 --> 00:39:26,270
being end up our own being that we could
start to see its limits.

694
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,700
You know,
human beings can envision time.

695
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,313
It's something that distinguishes us,
I think completely from other animals 

696
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:37,190
because we can see the future,
we can see multiple potential futures.

697
00:39:37,191 --> 00:39:38,024
And of course that's a massive advantage
because that means that we can see 

698
00:39:40,551 --> 00:39:43,070
terrible futures and strive to avoid 
them.

699
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,940
But it also means that we can see 
inevitably terrible future.

700
00:39:46,941 --> 00:39:47,774
So for example,
you know that even if you're not hungry 

701
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,650
now,
you're going to be hungry in the future.

702
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:55,130
And even if you're not ill now,
you're going to be ill in the future.

703
00:39:55,131 --> 00:39:58,520
And that even though you're not old now,
you're going to be old in the future.

704
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,130
And not the same as the case for 
everyone that you know.

705
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,410
And then everything decays and goes 
away.

706
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:08,900
And so that I think is what genesis 
portrays as the fall.

707
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,880
And I don't think there's any doubt 
about it.

708
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:11,983
I think if you read the story,
I mean people have been reading this 

709
00:40:14,031 --> 00:40:14,864
story for a very long period of time,
but to me it makes the case about as 

710
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:20,090
straightforwardly as any story possibly 
could.

711
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,553
So

712
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,630
now more about the tree.
Also,

713
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,473
there's the evolutionary tree and the 
evolutionary tree has the snake in it 

714
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,620
and the evolutionary tree also bears 
fruit.

715
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,550
And do you know that our color vision 
evolved to detect ripe fruit?

716
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,550
And I think the part of the reason that 
eve

717
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,083
temps

718
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:07,030
Adam towards consciousness is because 
women shared fruit with men.

719
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,820
And sharing food is a very,
very weird thing.

720
00:41:09,821 --> 00:41:10,654
I mean,
most mammals share food with their 

721
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:12,850
offspring,
right?

722
00:41:12,851 --> 00:41:16,270
So most other mammals will share food 
with their infants,

723
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,583
but human beings are very peculiar in 
that we'll share food with each other 

724
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:24,130
and we share food with strangers and 
it's built into us.

725
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:27,730
This isn't some cultural construct,
human being share food.

726
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,980
In fact,
if we don't eat communally,

727
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,220
our whole ability to regulate our eating
goes a strain,

728
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,183
get sick.

729
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,263
And we know perfectly well that our 
vision evolved to detect ripe fruit 

730
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:38,684
because one of the things we're really 
good at is detecting the difference 

731
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:46,271
between red and green and the 
relationship between fruit and evolution

732
00:41:46,581 --> 00:41:47,414
and women and consciousness is so tight 
that even many of the attributes that 

733
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:55,160
men find beautiful in women,
our fruit like attributes.

734
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,533
So it's an old and deep association.
And I think part of the reason that 

735
00:42:00,891 --> 00:42:01,724
women,
the way women tempted men towards self 

736
00:42:03,551 --> 00:42:04,384
consciousness is imagine that you're 
more self conscious if you're 

737
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:08,234
vulnerable.
And so I think that the idea that women 

738
00:42:09,801 --> 00:42:10,634
became self conscious first is probably 
right because women first of all had to 

739
00:42:14,841 --> 00:42:17,720
contend with the fact that they were 
small and easily damaged.

740
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:18,943
But even more particularly,
they had to contend with the fact that 

741
00:42:21,231 --> 00:42:24,710
they had infants who were small and 
easily damaged.

742
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,850
And I think that female nervous systems 
have actually evolved so that they're,

743
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,073
they're optimized for the,
for the female infant dyad and not for 

744
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:35,840
the female herself.

745
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,700
Because you might ask,
well,

746
00:42:37,701 --> 00:42:41,630
why are women more sensitive to negative
emotion and higher in agreeableness than

747
00:42:41,631 --> 00:42:43,640
men?
And it makes perfect sense.

748
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:45,260
I mean there's a lot of reasons why it 
might be,

749
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:46,094
but it particularly makes perfect sense 
if the nervous system that women are 

750
00:42:49,011 --> 00:42:49,844
using is adapted so that it's responding
to the world as as if the woman is a 

751
00:42:54,891 --> 00:42:58,550
dyad between her and her infant,
which is exactly how she's going to have

752
00:42:58,551 --> 00:43:01,730
to act if she's going to get an infant 
from the age of,

753
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:05,660
well zero to four certainly,
but we could say from zero to 14,

754
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,733
it's a hell of a burden.
It's the biggest maternal burden that 

755
00:43:08,841 --> 00:43:13,190
any creature on the planet caries.
And for some,

756
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:16,580
in some manner,
women were able to entice men into pr,

757
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,440
into,
um,

758
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:19,423
dyadic pair bonds.
And there's a variety of reasons why 

759
00:43:21,951 --> 00:43:22,670
that might be.

760
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:26,420
Some of the evolutionary biologists 
think it's because women are continually

761
00:43:26,421 --> 00:43:30,500
sexually available,
which makes them unique among about most

762
00:43:30,501 --> 00:43:31,334
animals and certainly unique among 
primates so that it made sense from a 

763
00:43:34,161 --> 00:43:34,994
sexual perspective persec perspective 
for a man to bind himself to one woman 

764
00:43:39,321 --> 00:43:40,154
because men are rather,
they have a strong sex drive and 

765
00:43:42,951 --> 00:43:44,780
they're,
they tend towards,

766
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:49,700
um,
they certainly as a general rule want to

767
00:43:49,701 --> 00:43:54,290
have sexual relationships more often 
than the typical woman.

768
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:55,124
But women are capable of doing that.
And women share food and women are 

769
00:43:58,341 --> 00:43:59,174
gatherers.
And so the idea that women enticed men 

770
00:44:01,821 --> 00:44:02,654
into self consciousness by sharing food 
with them strikes me as highly probable 

771
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:09,800
they,
that's an enticement.

772
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:11,863
And I think that women did make men self
conscious and I think they did it a 

773
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:15,194
whole bunch of ways.
I mean I think they first did it by 

774
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,013
making men more and more aware of how 
vulnerable women and children were and 

775
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,363
and drawing their attention to the fact 
that in principle that placed a moral 

776
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,520
responsibility on the man.
You know,

777
00:44:28,521 --> 00:44:32,490
we think of that as self evident now,
but it's certainly not self self evident

778
00:44:32,491 --> 00:44:35,040
in the animal kingdom.
So it's a,

779
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:35,874
it's a particularly human discovery.
And then I also think that women made 

780
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:41,640
men self conscious by rejecting them 
constantly.

781
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:49,150
And so what that also means is that 
women produced an evolutionary arms race

782
00:44:49,151 --> 00:44:52,210
in some sense among men and between men 
and women.

783
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,910
Because one of the things we have to 
account for you remember,

784
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:57,520
is are incredibly rapid cortical growth.

785
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:58,790
Okay.

786
00:44:58,790 --> 00:44:59,623
You know,
and it seems to me that our whole 

787
00:45:00,201 --> 00:45:03,350
variety of positive feedback loops got 
going at the same time.

788
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:04,603
And that's what produced a tremendous 
increase in our cortical capacity up to 

789
00:45:08,841 --> 00:45:11,960
the point where we became aware of our 
own vulnerability.

790
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,970
And that was the birth of self 
consciousness.

791
00:45:13,971 --> 00:45:16,310
Now,
one of the things that's very interested

792
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:17,203
interesting in genesis is that genesis 
portrays the emergence of self 

793
00:45:22,221 --> 00:45:23,054
consciousness as something so profound 
that it produced a cataclysmic rift in 

794
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:30,020
the structure of being,
you know,

795
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:30,854
and now of course,
whether or not you believe that depends 

796
00:45:32,421 --> 00:45:36,470
on what you think of as being,
but the idea,

797
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:37,543
I mean,
you think about the relationship that 

798
00:45:38,571 --> 00:45:40,250
human beings have with being,
I mean,

799
00:45:40,251 --> 00:45:42,500
first of all,
we don't really see ourselves as part of

800
00:45:42,501 --> 00:45:43,334
the natural world.
We see ourselves as somehow separate 

801
00:45:45,801 --> 00:45:48,470
from the natural world.
We also see ourselves.

802
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:49,303
It's so funny because most modern people
believe that the doctrine of original 

803
00:45:51,951 --> 00:45:55,490
sin is an absurd doctrine.
But I don't think I've ever met a modern

804
00:45:55,491 --> 00:45:59,720
person who isn't fully convinced of the 
doctrine of original sin.

805
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,153
I mean,
all you have to do is talk to an 

806
00:46:01,821 --> 00:46:02,654
environmentalist for 15 seconds and the 
first thing they'll tell you is that 

807
00:46:05,091 --> 00:46:05,924
there's something intrinsically corrupt 
about human beings and that we're 

808
00:46:08,181 --> 00:46:10,550
running around destroying the planet.
I mean,

809
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:11,623
how you can fail to see that as a modern
transformation of the idea of original 

810
00:46:15,411 --> 00:46:16,244
sin is beyond me.
The idea that there's something wrong 

811
00:46:18,981 --> 00:46:23,480
with people is the idea of original sin.
So,

812
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,370
and,
and do people not believe that?

813
00:46:25,371 --> 00:46:26,204
I mean,
who in this room feels that they're 

814
00:46:27,891 --> 00:46:28,724
everything they could be or who in this 
room feels that they're not in some 

815
00:46:31,791 --> 00:46:34,460
sense of fallen being?
I mean,

816
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:35,583
I've,
I've never met anyone who doesn't fit 

817
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:37,880
into that category.

818
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,350
The closest you ever get is somebody 
who's like psychopathic beyond belief.

819
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:44,240
You know,
and I mean,

820
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:48,230
people are burdened by their 
inadequacies to different degrees,

821
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,333
but virtually no one is virtually no one
is secure enough to stand forth as the 

822
00:46:55,761 --> 00:46:58,220
flawed beating they are and say,
well,

823
00:46:58,221 --> 00:47:00,500
everything's the way it should be with 
me.

824
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:04,490
So how the hell do you account for that?
Now I think,

825
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:06,920
I don't exactly know what the situation 
is,

826
00:47:06,921 --> 00:47:09,350
but it seems to me,
so one of the things that happens,

827
00:47:09,351 --> 00:47:12,360
I'll get back to the tree in the minute,
is that okay?

828
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:20,583
The serpent tap tamps,
he first of all to eat the tree of the 

829
00:47:24,161 --> 00:47:27,460
fruit of the knowledge of good and evil,
which is quite interesting.

830
00:47:27,461 --> 00:47:29,800
So it's the knowledge of good and evil.
So there's two trees,

831
00:47:29,801 --> 00:47:31,270
right?
There's the tree of life and there's the

832
00:47:31,271 --> 00:47:34,510
tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
And it's not good and bad.

833
00:47:34,511 --> 00:47:35,344
It's good and evil,
and it's the serpent that tempts eve to 

834
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:40,120
take the fruit.
Okay.

835
00:47:40,121 --> 00:47:40,954
So we've already talked about the 
potential role of the serpent and the 

836
00:47:42,911 --> 00:47:43,744
development of visual apprehension and 
the fact that human beings cognitive 

837
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:47,554
structure is primarily visual and that 
we have the best visual system of any 

838
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:54,370
primate on the planet and a better 
visual system that anything but birds.

839
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:57,220
And that that's tightly tied with our 
ability to see.

840
00:47:57,221 --> 00:47:58,054
And that fact that we can see and pay 
attention appears to be tightly tied 

841
00:48:00,701 --> 00:48:03,250
with our ability to detect their own 
vulnerability.

842
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:04,303
I mean,
it's,

843
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,520
it's a fair,
it's a pretty coherent story.

844
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:12,420
Now what happens after Adam and eve eat 
fruit?

845
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:16,921
It's,
it's,

846
00:48:16,921 --> 00:48:18,160
it's very,
it's very,

847
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:20,710
very complicated and happens in,
it's a very,

848
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:21,544
it's very interesting the way the story 
portrays it because it's all packed 

849
00:48:23,711 --> 00:48:26,800
together in almost no words.
So what happens?

850
00:48:26,801 --> 00:48:29,830
The serpent first tells eve,
if you eat this fruit,

851
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,440
you won't die because that's what God 
has said.

852
00:48:32,441 --> 00:48:33,274
Don't eat that thing or you'll die for 
God knows that in the day that you eat 

853
00:48:36,341 --> 00:48:37,174
thereof,
then your eyes shall be opened and ye 

854
00:48:38,111 --> 00:48:38,944
shall be as gods knowing good and evil.
Now that's very interesting because the 

855
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:44,254
first thing that happens is that there's
an intimation that whatever 

856
00:48:46,781 --> 00:48:49,870
transformative process occurs,
and as a consequence of this,

857
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:50,973
of this meal,
we'll elevate human beings further to 

858
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:54,934
the godlike status.
It's now it's strange because they've 

859
00:48:56,531 --> 00:48:58,810
already been attributed that to some 
degree in the story,

860
00:48:58,811 --> 00:48:59,644
right?
Because they're made in the image of 

861
00:49:00,611 --> 00:49:01,444
God.

862
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,673
But there's an intimation here that 
because of what happens as the 

863
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:06,904
transformation is that human beings 
prior to eating the fruit did not see 

864
00:49:10,271 --> 00:49:13,420
properly and they weren't aware of the 
fact that they were naked.

865
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,313
Now that you can derive that conclusion 
by noticing that that's what happens to 

866
00:49:17,081 --> 00:49:20,050
them when they do eat the fruit.
So,

867
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:21,603
and then so,
so there's this intimation that human 

868
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:24,394
beings are at a certain plane of being 
that that plane of being could be 

869
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:27,844
elevated in terms of power,
that one of the consequences of that 

870
00:49:30,821 --> 00:49:34,300
elevation would be all of a sudden that 
people became mortal beings.

871
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:38,440
And so what that also means is that the 
unconscious paradise,

872
00:49:38,441 --> 00:49:42,400
primary Pri prior to the emergence of 
self consciousness is,

873
00:49:42,401 --> 00:49:43,840
um,
it's,

874
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:44,820
it's,
it's a,

875
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:45,723
it's an amoral existence.
And so the way that that's being dealt 

876
00:49:48,131 --> 00:49:51,010
with historically is to assume that the 
conditions in the garden of Eden,

877
00:49:51,011 --> 00:49:51,844
we're sort of like the conditions of 
animal unconsciousness because animals 

878
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,324
aren't beyond good and evil.
They're just not in the domain of good 

879
00:49:57,971 --> 00:49:59,620
and evil.
And then you might ask,

880
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:00,550
well,
why is that?

881
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:04,540
What is there something particular about
the knowledge of good and evil?

882
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:05,861
Now,
you know,

883
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:09,140
modern people don't really believe in 
the idea of evil or in the idea of good,

884
00:50:09,141 --> 00:50:10,840
so they don't really ask questions like 
that.

885
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,990
But I think the story sheds clear light 
on exactly what this means.

886
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,360
If you have a question.
No.

887
00:50:16,361 --> 00:50:17,170
Okay.
Okay.

888
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:18,160
So yes.

889
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:26,723
Yeah.
Bit more about like what do you think 

890
00:50:28,701 --> 00:50:33,160
that means that they didn't,
that there had to be that extra level of

891
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,180
like thoughts even though they already 
had the,

892
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,113
they were made in the image.

893
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,133
Well I think it has to do with the 
difference between consciousness and 

894
00:50:40,991 --> 00:50:41,824
self consciousness because I think what 
happens initially is that creatures are 

895
00:50:45,551 --> 00:50:48,370
conscious but they're not self 
conscious.

896
00:50:48,371 --> 00:50:50,710
Now you might ask,
well what is self conscious mean?

897
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,120
Well it's complicated,
right?

898
00:50:52,121 --> 00:50:52,954
Because there is some evidence from the 
animal experimental literature that 

899
00:50:55,751 --> 00:50:57,850
animals have rudimentary self 
consciousness.

900
00:50:57,851 --> 00:50:58,684
So there's,
I think self consciousness is a 

901
00:51:00,611 --> 00:51:01,444
multifactorial construct.
It's not like something that's 

902
00:51:03,581 --> 00:51:04,414
reflective and automatic.
You're self conscious in that you know 

903
00:51:06,911 --> 00:51:07,744
that you exist and that you have some 
sense of your boundaries and that you 

904
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,064
have some sense of who and what you are.
But you're not fully self conscious 

905
00:51:15,221 --> 00:51:16,054
because you don't know exactly who or 
what you are and you don't know what 

906
00:51:18,521 --> 00:51:19,354
your possibilities are.
Limitations are and you don't know what 

907
00:51:20,921 --> 00:51:23,050
your essential nature is.
So,

908
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,033
and part of the reason that you're self 
conscious is because you're the 

909
00:51:26,141 --> 00:51:28,080
inheritor of a cultural tradition.

910
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:28,923
It's linguistically predicated that 
contains information about what human 

911
00:51:31,931 --> 00:51:32,764
beings are like that has been worked on 
by collective generations of human 

912
00:51:36,161 --> 00:51:38,050
beings over thousands and thousands of 
years.

913
00:51:38,051 --> 00:51:38,884
Right?
So partly the reason you're self 

914
00:51:39,491 --> 00:51:43,510
conscious is because you're educated and
there's no real limit to that.

915
00:51:43,511 --> 00:51:46,870
You come to university to become more 
self conscious.

916
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:48,063
So it's complicated,
but there's an initial self 

917
00:51:50,131 --> 00:51:53,200
consciousness that seems to be the 
precipitating event.

918
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:54,423
And I think it's reasonable to assume 
that that's associated with cortical 

919
00:51:57,341 --> 00:52:00,160
expansion and the development of 
enhanced cognitive ability.

920
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:03,610
I mean,
I don't think that that's a questionable

921
00:52:03,611 --> 00:52:04,444
assumption.
Everybody just just makes theK or as if 

922
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:08,584
that's the case.
We're intelligent enough to have 

923
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:14,050
discovered time.
And the problem with discovering time,

924
00:52:14,051 --> 00:52:16,090
which is the fourth dimension,
we're,

925
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:21,150
we're minimally extendable in time now.
We don't seem to be bothered by the fact

926
00:52:21,551 --> 00:52:24,550
that we're minimally extendable in 
space.

927
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:25,623
Right.
Because I mean here you are and you're 

928
00:52:26,771 --> 00:52:27,604
not over there.
And there are obviously limitations to 

929
00:52:29,501 --> 00:52:30,334
that and we do try to overcome them with
telephones and televisions and all of 

930
00:52:33,431 --> 00:52:35,680
our gadgets that put us everywhere at 
once.

931
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:36,933
But,
but to discover our finitude in time is 

932
00:52:40,361 --> 00:52:44,560
to discover time and it's not surprising
that that's represented in this story as

933
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:47,830
a cataclysmic disjunction in the 
structure of being.

934
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:51,190
That's how we experience it.
Something's wrong.

935
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:55,450
And I don't believe that that's how 
animals experience being like they might

936
00:52:55,451 --> 00:52:56,284
experience things that need to be done 
temporarily to put things back into 

937
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:00,453
proper balance,
but they're not set up to question the 

938
00:53:03,161 --> 00:53:06,640
nature of existence itself.
So anyways,

939
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:08,643
now.

940
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:09,683
Yup.
Is it possible that means the story is 

941
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:33,600
or historical production back to 
literary in literature or history of,

942
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:36,020
I think it's both.
No,

943
00:53:36,021 --> 00:53:38,220
I think it's both.
I think it's a description.

944
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,940
Architectural stories are true on 
multiple levels at the same time.

945
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:46,350
So I think it's a file or genetic and an
Auntie genetic story simultaneously.

946
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:47,603
There's no reason it can't be.
So there is the paradise allow element 

947
00:53:51,181 --> 00:53:54,270
of childhood prior to the emergence of 
self consciousness.

948
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,760
I can tell when my children learned they
were naked.

949
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,100
Actually it didn't bother my daughter at
all.

950
00:53:59,101 --> 00:53:59,934
But my son,
you know who's quite an emotionally 

951
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:06,150
stable person.
By the time he was two and a half likely

952
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,970
there is no damn way you were going in 
the bathroom with him.

953
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:12,150
And if he wasn't closed he would not 
show himself.

954
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,373
And as far as I could tell,
that was all his own doing because it 

955
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,080
wasn't like we were hung up about that 
and it didn't bother my daughter.

956
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:19,913
So it wasn't the familial environment 
that was producing that he was in an 

957
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:26,670
intensely private creature and that was 
his own discovery.

958
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:28,043
And you know,
I mean part of the reason I think that 

959
00:54:29,221 --> 00:54:32,490
people are self conscious is that we 
stand up right?

960
00:54:32,491 --> 00:54:33,324
And that we're very,
very exposed to the world in a way that 

961
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:38,520
most animals aren't.
But I also think there's more to it than

962
00:54:38,521 --> 00:54:40,530
that too,
is that because we were self conscious,

963
00:54:40,531 --> 00:54:45,330
we're also intensely aware of our own 
inadequacies and imperfections and we're

964
00:54:45,331 --> 00:54:49,440
not willing to share them with the world
except under very limited conditions.

965
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,930
And I would also say it's no wonder,
you know,

966
00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:52,764
cause people run around talking about 
how it would be better if we weren't 

967
00:54:54,961 --> 00:54:55,794
ashamed of our bodies.
It's like it's not exactly clear to me 

968
00:54:57,871 --> 00:55:00,060
that it would be better.
It's a pain in the neck,

969
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:03,330
but it makes you take care of them and 
try to fix them.

970
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,313
You know,
if you had no sense that there was 

971
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:07,260
something wrong,
why the hell would you try to fix it?

972
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,350
So I don't think you can have your cake 
and eat it too.

973
00:55:10,351 --> 00:55:11,161
You can't think,
oh,

974
00:55:11,161 --> 00:55:11,994
I'm perfect just the way I am.
And then also be motivated to make 

975
00:55:15,151 --> 00:55:17,490
things better.
That's not possible.

976
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:21,090
Now you might be able to say the fact 
that I'm away,

977
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:25,530
I'm the way I am is acceptable given my 
plans to make things better,

978
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:26,364
which I think is perfectly reasonable.
You don't want to be so ashamed that 

979
00:55:28,831 --> 00:55:31,490
you're immobilized.
That seems counterproductive.

980
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,580
But the idea that people have nothing to
be ashamed of strikes me as naive beyond

981
00:55:35,581 --> 00:55:37,440
belief.
So,

982
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,753
so anyways,
I do think it's onto genetic and Fila 

983
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:44,460
genetic simultaneously.
And when the woman saw that the tree was

984
00:55:44,461 --> 00:55:45,294
good for food and then it was pleasant 
to the eyes and a tree to be desired to 

985
00:55:47,851 --> 00:55:48,684
make one wise,
she took of the fruit thereof and did 

986
00:55:50,191 --> 00:55:52,650
eat and gave also unto her husband with 
her.

987
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:53,663
And he did eat and the eyes of both of 
them were open and they knew they were 

988
00:55:58,921 --> 00:56:03,420
naked and they sewed fig leaves together
and made themselves aprons.

989
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:06,990
And there's an awful lot of information 
packed into those few lines.

990
00:56:06,991 --> 00:56:09,450
So the first is,
is that it's the woman,

991
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,130
the woman precipitates this.

992
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,670
And I believe that that's the case.
I think that that,

993
00:56:15,671 --> 00:56:18,490
I think that women still make men self 
conscious.

994
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:21,460
And I think they do that because of 
their vulnerability,

995
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:22,623
because of their vulnerability infants,
but also because they're incredibly 

996
00:56:25,421 --> 00:56:28,240
harsh judges of men.
So we know,

997
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:29,410
for example,
from the,

998
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,513
from the dating site studies that women 
regard 85% of men is below average in 

999
00:56:34,071 --> 00:56:36,550
physical appearance.
So,

1000
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:39,850
and we also know that the default 
response to a woman in,

1001
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:40,690
in,
in,

1002
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,510
in response to a mating request is,
are you kidding?

1003
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:45,393
So,
and there's nothing that makes more men 

1004
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:49,720
more self conscious than that.
And you might say,

1005
00:56:49,721 --> 00:56:50,554
well what's the consequence of that?
And one is eternal enmity between the 

1006
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:55,930
sexes.
So women,

1007
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,480
men hate women because they get rejected
all the time.

1008
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:03,481
And that manifests itself in all sorts 
of underground war against women.

1009
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:05,103
And,
and in some cultures the is virtually 

1010
00:57:06,371 --> 00:57:07,204
total and but it also manifests it in 
men's attempts to continually make 

1011
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:14,560
themselves better so that they can 
attract women.

1012
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,030
And so,
you know,

1013
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:18,580
there's no doubt that women with their 
selective mating,

1014
00:57:18,581 --> 00:57:19,414
which is partly what makes them 
different than chimpanzees have been a 

1015
00:57:21,581 --> 00:57:25,750
major motivating force for the 
development of culture status.

1016
00:57:25,751 --> 00:57:26,584
Turns out to be important to men.
And I think you can make a very strong 

1017
00:57:29,171 --> 00:57:30,004
case that culture itself has been the 
product of status competition in large 

1018
00:57:34,691 --> 00:57:39,691
part be the consequence of status 
competition between men driven by women.

1019
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:44,870
So,
so anyways,

1020
00:57:44,871 --> 00:57:47,110
so they both eat the fruit and then 
they're naked.

1021
00:57:47,111 --> 00:57:47,944
Now,
this is an interesting thing because as 

1022
00:57:49,241 --> 00:57:51,280
I said,
the fruit is the fruit of the tree.

1023
00:57:51,281 --> 00:57:52,390
And the tree is a very,
very,

1024
00:57:52,391 --> 00:57:54,960
very complicated thing.
So it's,

1025
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,100
it's,
uh,

1026
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:56,933
the tree represents something that's 
manifesting itself on multiple levels 

1027
00:57:59,621 --> 00:58:01,390
simultaneously.
So as there,

1028
00:58:01,391 --> 00:58:06,391
there's the actual trees in which the 
actual fruits grew and the actual fruits

1029
00:58:07,781 --> 00:58:08,380
that ripened.

1030
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:10,750
And that sharpened our vision that gave 
us color vision,

1031
00:58:10,751 --> 00:58:13,480
and that constituted a large part of our
diet.

1032
00:58:13,481 --> 00:58:17,950
And that we did forge for and share.
And then there's,

1033
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:19,143
there's the metaphysical tree,
which is the tree that produced that 

1034
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:22,624
fruit that produced that,
that neurological transformation that 

1035
00:58:25,031 --> 00:58:27,760
went along with that over the course of 
evolution.

1036
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,550
And then there's another tree that lurks
in there,

1037
00:58:30,551 --> 00:58:35,530
which is the tree that constitutes the,
the human being itself,

1038
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:38,500
because we're also frequently symbolized
as trees.

1039
00:58:38,501 --> 00:58:40,570
And I think we're like,
we're,

1040
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,513
it's the microcosm,
macrocosm tree that's reflected in the 

1041
00:58:44,531 --> 00:58:46,830
Scandinavian figure of the world tree,
you know,

1042
00:58:46,831 --> 00:58:47,664
so that's a drizzle.
So you know that some of you have no 

1043
00:58:49,991 --> 00:58:54,370
doubt watched the avengers and you see 
that both Loki and thor come from,

1044
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:58,600
um,
as guard and as guard is actually in the

1045
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:01,180
branches of the Scandinavian world tree.

1046
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,450
Now the question is,
what is the Scandinavian world tree?

1047
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,583
Well,
it's even represented this way in the 

1048
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:11,290
movies.
The Scandinavian world tree isn't a tree

1049
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:13,690
like a tree in the forest to 
Scandinavian world.

1050
00:59:13,691 --> 00:59:18,691
Tree is the microcosm to macrocosm tree.
So it's like the subatomic realm and the

1051
00:59:20,231 --> 00:59:23,120
atomic realm and molecular realm and the
realm above that.

1052
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:23,954
And then the phenomenal logical realm.
And then the cosmic realm emerging as a 

1053
00:59:27,621 --> 00:59:28,454
set of stacked phenomena.
And the gods inhabit the upper reaches 

1054
00:59:32,031 --> 00:59:32,864
of that tree.
And that's the same tree that the world 

1055
00:59:34,791 --> 00:59:35,624
tree that's Sharman climb up and down 
when they have their shamonic 

1056
00:59:38,051 --> 00:59:38,884
transformation experiences,
which are usually initiated as a 

1057
00:59:41,571 --> 00:59:44,570
consequence of their interactions with 
hallucinogenic drugs,

1058
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:49,870
often mushrooms and the Sharman report 
that they die and decompose to skeletons

1059
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:52,700
and then climb the world tree and enter 
heaven.

1060
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,520
And people like Eliana,
who were the,

1061
00:59:55,521 --> 00:59:58,490
some of the initial observers of the 
shamonic phenomenon,

1062
00:59:58,491 --> 01:00:01,580
believed that the use of drugs was a 
decadent,

1063
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:05,060
um,
after consequence of a pure,

1064
01:00:05,061 --> 01:00:06,080
original tradition.

1065
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,913
But the modern evidence suggests very 
strongly that it's the use of the 

1066
01:00:10,251 --> 01:00:11,084
psychedelic mushrooms in particular that
produced the death rebirth experience 

1067
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:18,470
and the climbing up and down the 
microcosm to macrocosm tree.

1068
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:21,050
There's been some very interesting 
recent downturn,

1069
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:25,610
logical research done on Sharman who use
Iowasca in the Amazon jungle.

1070
01:00:25,611 --> 01:00:26,444
And the tree they seem to climb up and 
down is all the way down to the 

1071
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:32,480
molecular and all the way up to the 
cosmic.

1072
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,870
And there are people who have,
who believe,

1073
01:00:35,871 --> 01:00:39,560
who've given credence to the idea that 
the shaman can go down far enough to see

1074
01:00:39,561 --> 01:00:41,960
DNA.
Now,

1075
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:43,140
you know,
we don't know.

1076
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:45,620
We have no idea what to make of those 
sorts of reports.

1077
01:00:45,621 --> 01:00:46,620
But,
um,

1078
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,833
I would be very hesitant about 
dismissing them because the world's a 

1079
01:00:50,421 --> 01:00:53,990
very weird place and there's nothing in 
the world that stranger than psychedelic

1080
01:00:53,991 --> 01:00:54,824
drugs.

1081
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:55,843
And people have been using those for 
tens of thousands of years and a 

1082
01:00:58,521 --> 01:00:59,354
tremendous number of our religious 
traditions are a consequence of use of 

1083
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:03,673
hallucinogenic naturally occurring 
hallucinogenic chemicals and they seem 

1084
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:07,664
to produce profound transformations of 
consciousness and profound enough so 

1085
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:12,410
that we have no idea what to make of 
them.

1086
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:16,130
So that the tree is a very,
very complicated thing.

1087
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,200
And it seems to me,
you know,

1088
01:01:18,201 --> 01:01:21,540
inside a cathedral,
you know the pillars and the columns,

1089
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:24,680
those are tree like structures,
especially in the gothic cathedrals.

1090
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:29,681
They look almost exactly like,
like the canopy of of old growth forests

1091
01:01:29,991 --> 01:01:30,824
and the trees that are in there are the 
trees that we lived in tens of millions 

1092
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,070
of years ago,
but they're also the tree that's growing

1093
01:01:37,071 --> 01:01:37,904
up from the tiniest micro realm up to 
the macro realm and attempting to 

1094
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:42,614
manifest itself in perfectly harmonious 
layers at every single level of 

1095
01:01:47,451 --> 01:01:48,680
structure all the way up.

1096
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:50,203
And I think that part of what people are
doing when they practice things like 

1097
01:01:52,431 --> 01:01:54,320
yoga and they're trying to get the 
shockers,

1098
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:55,520
so to speak,
aligned,

1099
01:01:55,521 --> 01:01:56,354
is that the shock was our like cross 
sections of that tree at different 

1100
01:02:00,051 --> 01:02:03,650
levels of emergence.
And the person who is practicing yoga is

1101
01:02:03,651 --> 01:02:04,484
trying to get their body aligned so that
the communication from the microcosmic 

1102
01:02:09,471 --> 01:02:10,304
level to the macro cosmic level is 
completely facilitated and free of 

1103
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:14,750
blockages.
So on.

1104
01:02:14,751 --> 01:02:16,820
I don't know if you know that when 
people do yoga,

1105
01:02:16,821 --> 01:02:20,550
when they really know how to do it,
they don't do it does them.

1106
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:25,320
So yoga happens to people spontaneously 
when they wake up and the,

1107
01:02:25,321 --> 01:02:26,154
you know,
the Yogis talk about that as the 

1108
01:02:27,181 --> 01:02:28,014
influence of the Kundalini serpent,
which is the thing that lives at the 

1109
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:30,954
base of the spine and when the Yogi is 
sufficiently sophisticated in his 

1110
01:02:35,341 --> 01:02:36,174
practice there the body moves by itself 
and straightens itself out and aligns 

1111
01:02:40,201 --> 01:02:44,640
itself along the central axis of being.
And if it's aligned properly,

1112
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:46,680
that's when divine revelations will 
occur.

1113
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:50,340
And that's what you see manifested in 
religious symbolism.

1114
01:02:50,341 --> 01:02:51,174
When you look at the figure of the 
Buddha who sitting in this triangular 

1115
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:57,090
position and he's completely covered in 
gold,

1116
01:02:57,091 --> 01:02:57,924
is that he's aligned his body,
the levels of the material being so 

1117
01:03:01,621 --> 01:03:04,950
perfectly that the information flow 
across the levels of,

1118
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:06,173
of structure are without flaw.
And that puts them simultaneously in 

1119
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:14,520
contact with the microcosmic realm and 
the macro cosmic realm.

1120
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:16,103
So

1121
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,150
all right,
so,

1122
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:20,890
so the tree is a very,
very,

1123
01:03:20,891 --> 01:03:21,724
very complicated idea.
There's the tree that you are and 

1124
01:03:23,651 --> 01:03:25,840
there's the tree that the cosmos itself 
is.

1125
01:03:25,841 --> 01:03:29,500
And the third is the tree that we lived 
in and there's the tree that bears fruit

1126
01:03:29,501 --> 01:03:34,420
and those are all the same tree from a,
from a broader perspective.

1127
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:42,810
So your eyes are opened and they 
realized they were naked.

1128
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:47,670
I'm just wondering how this sort of ties
in with the time,

1129
01:03:47,671 --> 01:03:50,780
the realization of client,
where they immortal before that.

1130
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:51,731
No,
but they,

1131
01:03:51,731 --> 01:03:52,770
they,
they had no set,

1132
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,050
no concept of death.
Okay.

1133
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,670
So that,
that's a very good question.

1134
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,504
Well,
I think the absence of death prior to 

1135
01:03:59,251 --> 01:04:02,190
the emergence of self consciousness,
I mean,

1136
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,810
figuring out what death is is a very 
tricky thing.

1137
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:07,703
I mean,
one element of death is that you cease 

1138
01:04:09,361 --> 01:04:14,310
to be as a physical form.
Well death for humans is a lot more than

1139
01:04:14,311 --> 01:04:16,530
that.
It's not only that you cease to exist as

1140
01:04:16,531 --> 01:04:19,140
a material for is your bloody well know 
it.

1141
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:20,843
And that's where death where,
that's where dance has it's primary 

1142
01:04:22,891 --> 01:04:24,480
sting.
You know,

1143
01:04:24,481 --> 01:04:26,850
if there was,
if there was no apprehension of death,

1144
01:04:26,851 --> 01:04:30,210
it would be a lot less dramatic 
experience than it actually is.

1145
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,073
I mean,
it's complicated because if you look at 

1146
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:34,640
elephants,
elephants are,

1147
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:37,620
are pretty self conscious.
They seem to be,

1148
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,860
they seem to understand to some degree 
what death means.

1149
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,113
They will return to the place where an 
elephant that they knew well died and 

1150
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:46,464
they will move the bones around.
And so they seem to be able to remember 

1151
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:53,100
the cessation of being over a very long 
period of time.

1152
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:56,580
But they certainly can't conceptualize 
it the way we do because they don't have

1153
01:04:56,581 --> 01:04:59,940
any tools of conceptualization.
They're not linguistic.

1154
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,800
So I think that the,
the,

1155
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:03,900
the,
the,

1156
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:04,973
the self,
the unselfconscious pre death paradise 

1157
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:11,640
is prior to self consciousness.
And it's the same state that,

1158
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:12,863
that a child exists in before there,
before they are aware that they're 

1159
01:05:15,781 --> 01:05:16,591
naked,
you know?

1160
01:05:16,591 --> 01:05:19,990
And that develops in,
in Russia's in some sense,

1161
01:05:19,991 --> 01:05:21,670
you know,
so,

1162
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:22,993
all right.
So the eyes of both of them were opened 

1163
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:25,504
and they knew they were naked and they 
sewed fig leaves together and made 

1164
01:05:28,001 --> 01:05:28,930
themselves aprons.
Well,

1165
01:05:28,931 --> 01:05:32,110
that's a massive transformation in that 
statement.

1166
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:34,270
So first of all,
people figure out that they're naked.

1167
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:35,141
Now you think,
well,

1168
01:05:35,141 --> 01:05:37,540
what does it mean to figure out that 
you're naked?

1169
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,960
Well,
generally that's red in a sexual sense.

1170
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:44,470
And I think the sexual sense can't be 
over.

1171
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:46,083
Like it can't be ignored because I think
part of the way that people are 

1172
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:52,300
primarily self conscious is sexually,
right?

1173
01:05:52,301 --> 01:05:57,301
Because the most fundamental element of 
being evaluated by another is evaluation

1174
01:05:59,531 --> 01:06:01,930
for sexual attractiveness.
And so,

1175
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,033
you know,
men bear the burden of that because 

1176
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:05,374
they're constantly compared to other men
in terms of their accomplishments and 

1177
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:10,060
their position in the dominance 
hierarchy.

1178
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:14,710
And women bear the brunt of that because
they're constantly being compared to the

1179
01:06:14,711 --> 01:06:15,544
ideal feminine form.
And the ideal feminine form is 

1180
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:20,890
associated both with sexuality and with 
reproduction.

1181
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:22,323
And so there's no doubt that the,
the fact of a sexual ideal makes 

1182
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:29,260
everyone intensely self conscious.

1183
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:30,750
Now you know,
if,

1184
01:06:30,751 --> 01:06:31,584
if you look at,
there are all sorts of attempts 

1185
01:06:34,001 --> 01:06:36,490
constantly to write that off to cultural
factors.

1186
01:06:36,491 --> 01:06:38,320
You know,
to say that the reason that women are so

1187
01:06:38,321 --> 01:06:39,154
intensely concerned with their body 
images because we've constructed false 

1188
01:06:42,071 --> 01:06:42,904
cultural representations of beauty,
it's like I don't think there's any 

1189
01:06:45,191 --> 01:06:46,024
evidence for that claim at all.
I mean there's plenty of evidence for 

1190
01:06:49,091 --> 01:06:49,924
what is regarded as optimally healthy 
and attractive with regards to women 

1191
01:06:54,221 --> 01:06:56,650
cross.
Culturally there are variations in it.

1192
01:06:56,651 --> 01:06:59,200
So body size for example,
is one of the variations.

1193
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:04,210
But body shape is very seldomly varied 
and symmetry is virtually never varied.

1194
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:08,320
And skin quality is never varied and 
youth is never varied.

1195
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:09,790
So there's plenty.
And,

1196
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:10,624
and the reason those things appear to be
never varied is because they're good 

1197
01:07:12,851 --> 01:07:16,480
markers of fertility and health and 
across culture.

1198
01:07:16,481 --> 01:07:17,314
Men,
women like man who are higher up in the 

1199
01:07:18,551 --> 01:07:19,510
dominance hierarchy.

1200
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:20,643
And I think what women have done is 
outsourced the problem of sexual 

1201
01:07:22,931 --> 01:07:23,764
selection to competition among men.
So all they do is let men compete and 

1202
01:07:27,641 --> 01:07:30,670
then peel off the top,
which is a perfectly reasonable,

1203
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:33,250
it's an absolutely reasonable way of 
solving the problem.

1204
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,233
But what that does is make all the men 
who were in the lower stratas of the 

1205
01:07:36,911 --> 01:07:40,170
socioeconomic hierarchy intensely 
self-conscious,

1206
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,073
angry and resentful,
and they become like homicidal and 

1207
01:07:45,491 --> 01:07:48,190
genocidal if things are pushed too far.
I mean,

1208
01:07:48,191 --> 01:07:49,024
Martin Daly and Margo Wilson have done a
perfectly reasonable job of laying out 

1209
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:57,100
the consequence of very unequal 
societies on male aggression.

1210
01:07:57,101 --> 01:07:57,934
And what happens is that as the 
probability that young men will be able 

1211
01:08:01,091 --> 01:08:01,924
to climb up a dominance hierarchy 
decreases the young men at the bottom 

1212
01:08:04,961 --> 01:08:07,420
become increasingly murderous and 
impulsive.

1213
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:09,340
And it's,
it's not surprising.

1214
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:10,503
Not only did they delineate that,
but they showed that the men who become 

1215
01:08:13,241 --> 01:08:15,890
successfully impulsive,
aggressive,

1216
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:16,873
and they did this most in their studies 
of Chicago gang behavior actually push 

1217
01:08:20,131 --> 01:08:23,030
themselves up the hierarchy fast enough 
and far enough.

1218
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:25,190
So they immediately become attractive to
women.

1219
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:29,330
So the fact that they become impulsively
aggressive and even murderous,

1220
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:31,710
it works.
So it's,

1221
01:08:31,711 --> 01:08:32,544
it's not,
it's not some side effect of some 

1222
01:08:33,921 --> 01:08:34,754
process that's gone wrong.
It's what you do when the competition 

1223
01:08:37,911 --> 01:08:41,090
pressures become so high that you can't 
climb the hierarchy.

1224
01:08:41,091 --> 01:08:42,860
As a consequence,
they have diligent,

1225
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:43,893
um,
application of prosocial behavior over 

1226
01:08:46,221 --> 01:08:49,640
the long run.
Margo daily and,

1227
01:08:49,641 --> 01:08:51,050
and,
and uh,

1228
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:54,350
Wilson,
Margo Wilson and he said Margo Wilson.

1229
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:54,890
Yeah,
it's,

1230
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:59,890
it's Margo Wilson and daily,
What's dailies name there at mcmaster?

1231
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:05,510
Look Up David bus buses.
The best source for this.

1232
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:08,330
He wrote a textbook on evolutionary 
psychology.

1233
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:09,680
It's a great book.
I mean,

1234
01:09:09,681 --> 01:09:10,514
mostly textbooks aren't great books,
but his textbook on evolutionary 

1235
01:09:12,651 --> 01:09:13,484
psychology is great book.
And if you look at the sexual selection 

1236
01:09:15,411 --> 01:09:16,520
chapters,
you know,

1237
01:09:16,521 --> 01:09:19,430
they're incredibly illuminating.
So you know,

1238
01:09:19,431 --> 01:09:20,264
the correlation between male 
socioeconomic success and access to 

1239
01:09:22,881 --> 01:09:25,910
sexual partners is like 0.5.
It's high.

1240
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:29,180
It's the determining factor.
It's no joke.

1241
01:09:29,181 --> 01:09:30,890
And between,
for women it's zero.

1242
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:33,590
So you know,
in that,

1243
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:35,240
well,
that's how it is.

1244
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:36,623
And so,

1245
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:39,673
sorry.

1246
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:42,470
Oh yeah.
Male aggression.

1247
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,390
They looked at Chicago in particular,
what they found for example,

1248
01:09:45,391 --> 01:09:47,970
was in the Chicago gangs.
Um,

1249
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:49,493
generally what happened because there 
are very high rates of male on male 

1250
01:09:51,631 --> 01:09:55,560
homicide in the Chicago gang scene and 
it's usually interracial,

1251
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:58,920
not cross racial and it's usually young 
man against young men.

1252
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:00,323
So you know,
you're much more likely to be killed by 

1253
01:10:01,741 --> 01:10:02,574
murder if you're a young man then if 
you're an older woman and although it's 

1254
01:10:04,831 --> 01:10:07,140
the older women who are most afraid of 
this sort of thing.

1255
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:09,690
So young man who are always getting 
killed by other young men.

1256
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:13,740
And basically what Daly and Wilson 
showed was that if you are a gang member

1257
01:10:13,741 --> 01:10:16,860
in Chicago and you were charged with 
murder,

1258
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:20,490
usually the murder was a consequence of 
some kind of status,

1259
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,140
um,
challenge.

1260
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:26,340
So maybe it's gang member ray against 
you and your gang member be while you're

1261
01:10:26,341 --> 01:10:28,150
fighting,
maybe you're both arms.

1262
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:30,120
So he,
he's going to kill you.

1263
01:10:30,121 --> 01:10:31,860
Are you going to kill him?
It's a toss up.

1264
01:10:31,861 --> 01:10:32,850
You kill him.
Okay.

1265
01:10:32,851 --> 01:10:34,440
Then what happens?
Well,

1266
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:38,160
no one testifies against you and you 
plead,

1267
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:39,031
you know,
they,

1268
01:10:39,031 --> 01:10:40,770
they nailed it.
They try to nail you for,

1269
01:10:40,771 --> 01:10:43,710
um,
for a homicide,

1270
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:44,573
say second degree murder and you plead 
self defense and they plea bargain it 

1271
01:10:47,851 --> 01:10:48,684
down to manslaughter and they throw you 
in jail for three years and you're out 

1272
01:10:51,241 --> 01:10:55,080
in a year and a half on good behavior 
and your status goes way up.

1273
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:58,860
So it's a perfectly reasonable,

1274
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:02,130
it's not a,
it's not a,

1275
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,830
what would you call equilibrated 
solution,

1276
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,610
but the reasons for it are quite clear 
and it works.

1277
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:14,340
Have you ever seen the,
the evolutionary rap by the Canadian?

1278
01:11:14,341 --> 01:11:14,851
You know,
the one,

1279
01:11:14,851 --> 01:11:16,260
I mean,
it's great.

1280
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:19,590
It's great.
I babba Babba what's his name?

1281
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:23,820
Babba I don't remember.
Look it up.

1282
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:25,890
Evolutionary rap.
It's brilliant.

1283
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:26,813
He takes all of the evolutionary 
psychology work that's been done over 

1284
01:11:28,981 --> 01:11:29,814
the last 15 years and casts,
it's as a gangster rap song and it's 

1285
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:39,470
extraordinarily well done.
Jesus.

1286
01:11:45,261 --> 01:11:46,550
Don't you have anything better to do?

1287
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:53,080
Martha Stewart?
She Ain't,

1288
01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:53,983
she spoke and she's very funny piece by 
saying it's just them that basically 

1289
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:04,740
you're,
you're clearly edit for president.

1290
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,270
So let me give you some.

1291
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:08,840
Okay,

1292
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:09,750
so she,
she cooks,

1293
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:14,660
she proceeds to give these hilarious but
probably useful tests.

1294
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:18,210
And at the end of that,
the crowds standing feet for her.

1295
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,330
Well this is funny,
but I was,

1296
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:24,470
I was puzzled by the finding of the 
standing ovation.

1297
01:12:24,471 --> 01:12:29,360
But I think when you're talking about is
basically she had credit,

1298
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:30,463
like she

1299
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:36,930
female sexual fantasy is beauty and the 
beast.

1300
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:41,860
Now if you,
if you don't believe that you might give

1301
01:12:41,861 --> 01:12:46,300
some consideration to the phenomenal 
popularity of 50 shades of grey.

1302
01:12:48,050 --> 01:12:50,540
Now why is that?
Well,

1303
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:53,450
it's because women don't want a man who 
isn't dangerous.

1304
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:59,810
They want a man who's really dangerous 
or who can be really dangerous,

1305
01:12:59,811 --> 01:13:02,330
but who,
who is capable of not being

1306
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:04,473
so,
and that's closely allied with youngs 

1307
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:10,930
idea of the incorporation of the shadow.
So if you're,

1308
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:11,793
if you're a developed as a male,
you should be too dangerous to mess 

1309
01:13:15,731 --> 01:13:16,564
with,
but you should be civilized enough to 

1310
01:13:18,491 --> 01:13:22,270
keep that under control.
And that's not the same as repression of

1311
01:13:22,271 --> 01:13:25,210
aggression and sexuality.
It's not the same at all.

1312
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:28,060
That just means that you're still a five
year old boy.

1313
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,340
That's the eatable outcome,
right?

1314
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:31,383
Where the mother is so terrified of the 
male movement towards dominance and 

1315
01:13:35,651 --> 01:13:36,484
aggression that she squashes it 
completely and keeps the the male at 

1316
01:13:39,911 --> 01:13:44,440
unit level for the rest of his life 
turning him into something that's like a

1317
01:13:44,441 --> 01:13:46,720
potato that's grown in the darkness,
in the,

1318
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:47,830
in the,
in the,

1319
01:13:47,831 --> 01:13:48,880
in the basement.
You know,

1320
01:13:48,881 --> 01:13:49,714
with white tubers coming up everywhere 
and resentful and murderous underneath 

1321
01:13:53,021 --> 01:13:55,540
all that,
it's not a positive outcome.

1322
01:13:56,470 --> 01:13:57,303
You know,
it's associated with the destruction of 

1323
01:13:58,421 --> 01:14:00,250
consciousness.
That's the oedipal story.

1324
01:14:00,940 --> 01:14:03,520
And like women are afraid of men because
they're monsters.

1325
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:05,673
But the problem is,
is that for bidding a man to become a 

1326
01:14:08,531 --> 01:14:12,400
monster just makes him a monster.
It drives it underground.

1327
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:13,863
What has to happen is the men have to be
taught how to be civilized monsters and 

1328
01:14:17,081 --> 01:14:20,770
we're doing a very bad job of that.
You know,

1329
01:14:20,771 --> 01:14:22,750
it's it and we're going to pay a big 
price for it.

1330
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:24,490
I think we're already paying a price for
it.

1331
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:26,920
I mean,
one of the prices that seems to be being

1332
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:30,340
paid in Japan is that people in Japan 
don't have sex anymore.

1333
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:32,013
So

1334
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:36,640
maybe loaded someone try and frame it 
well,

1335
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:40,850
but um,
like their rape culture movement towards

1336
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:43,360
educating men,
not to rape women.

1337
01:14:43,361 --> 01:14:47,010
He said of educating and how big 
dialogue,

1338
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:48,093
and I'm wondering how much,
what exactly you're talking about is 

1339
01:14:49,971 --> 01:14:50,804
about incorporating sexuality and I'm 
like women that affectual in a healthy 

1340
01:14:57,171 --> 01:15:00,530
way so that it doesn't come out sort of 
underground in the go violet.

1341
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:03,540
Well,
at tremendous amount of the push to,

1342
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:04,703
to and,
and the push behind the whole idea of 

1343
01:15:06,311 --> 01:15:09,790
rape culture is violently anti male 
movement.

1344
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:13,270
The idea that there's a rape culture is 
completely insane.

1345
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:15,370
No men get together and say,
well,

1346
01:15:15,371 --> 01:15:17,260
I think we should go out and rape some 
women,

1347
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:21,250
especially not in,
in like relatively civilized western and

1348
01:15:21,251 --> 01:15:22,500
North American cultures,

1349
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:28,660
Frat boys together to get women way too 
drunk.

1350
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:29,980
Yes,
yes.

1351
01:15:29,981 --> 01:15:30,814
But I understand that,
but that's more that I would say that 

1352
01:15:34,421 --> 01:15:38,650
that's more a consequence of stupidity 
and inability than anything else.

1353
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:43,030
Women don't get together and do this.
You can't deny that that happened.

1354
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:46,590
I can't deny that it happens,
but I can deny that it's a culture

1355
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:52,320
correct title and that,
uh,

1356
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:53,393
anyway,

1357
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:55,431
well let's look,
I,

1358
01:15:55,431 --> 01:15:56,950
I don't want to know how to talk about 
that,

1359
01:15:56,951 --> 01:15:58,270
but let's,
let's go back to it.

1360
01:15:58,560 --> 01:15:59,393
How am I going to say,
if you want to look at some literature 

1361
01:16:00,531 --> 01:16:01,900
on that,
you slipped up gentry,

1362
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:03,870
Macquarie,
Dr Dunkin security,

1363
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:06,863
other interesting information about how 
they might be trying to turn these are 

1364
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,670
any like and rubber line,
but like it's the Arab,

1365
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:13,563
anybody in the house and like the of 
brother had been covering for each 

1366
01:16:15,411 --> 01:16:16,244
other.

1367
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:18,680
Yeah.
It's all also one of the things that you

1368
01:16:18,681 --> 01:16:22,190
absolutely have to understand that no 
alcohol means no rape.

1369
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,593
Yeah.

1370
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,650
So it's as simple as that.
I mean,

1371
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:30,510
I studied the effects of alcohol and 
criminal behavior for five years and the

1372
01:16:30,511 --> 01:16:31,344
truth of the matter is,
is that almost no men would be 

1373
01:16:32,791 --> 01:16:35,870
aggressive ever if they weren't drunk.
So if,

1374
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:36,930
if there,
if the front,

1375
01:16:36,931 --> 01:16:37,764
if the fraternities were alcohol free,
almost all of this would immediately 

1376
01:16:40,921 --> 01:16:42,990
disappear.
Alcohol makes people,

1377
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:47,130
well,
partly the reason that alcohol is fun is

1378
01:16:47,131 --> 01:16:48,680
because it's completely disinhibiting.

1379
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:49,460
Yeah.
So,

1380
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:50,181
yeah,
you're right.

1381
01:16:50,181 --> 01:16:51,014
I'm thinking of things like rape culture
would exist without stripping what is 

1382
01:16:55,251 --> 01:16:57,800
actually making them.

1383
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:00,780
Well,
what happens with alcohol?

1384
01:17:00,781 --> 01:17:01,614
I mean,
we did some studies looking at how 

1385
01:17:02,881 --> 01:17:06,210
alcohol makes people aggressive because 
it does,

1386
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:09,710
it's one of the only drugs that actually
makes aggressive,

1387
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,800
even cocaine doesn't make people 
aggressive,

1388
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,050
but alcohol does.
So for example,

1389
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:16,243
one of the things my supervisor did was 
he would bring people into the lab and 

1390
01:17:20,181 --> 01:17:21,950
get them pretty intoxicated,
you know,

1391
01:17:21,951 --> 01:17:25,220
like up enough so that they would be at 
the level that you would hit if you were

1392
01:17:25,221 --> 01:17:27,830
out for a party pre drinking,
let's say.

1393
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:31,050
And then they would play a competitive 
shark game,

1394
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:34,100
or the,
one of the protagonists was a computer.

1395
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:37,910
And so the drunk people,
so you could shock you're,

1396
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:38,680
you're,
uh,

1397
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:43,680
opponent if they violated some rule or 
at any other time if you felt like it.

1398
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:47,690
And the,
the drunk people would shock them harder

1399
01:17:47,691 --> 01:17:50,360
and longer.
And so one theory was,

1400
01:17:50,361 --> 01:17:51,194
well,
people who are drunk just don't know 

1401
01:17:52,221 --> 01:17:53,240
what they're doing.

1402
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:56,840
Okay.
So what my advisor did was he had people

1403
01:17:56,841 --> 01:17:57,674
write down the duration and level of the
sharks that they were administering and 

1404
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:02,594
when they were drunk,
that made them administer longer and 

1405
01:18:04,881 --> 01:18:05,714
harder shocks.
So it isn't at all that people don't 

1406
01:18:08,151 --> 01:18:08,984
know what they're doing.
What it is is they don't care what 

1407
01:18:10,941 --> 01:18:13,220
they're doing.
That's a whole different thing.

1408
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:16,950
They don't lose self consciousness.
What they lose is the,

1409
01:18:17,450 --> 01:18:20,840
the worry of the fear of the 
consequences that's gone.

1410
01:18:20,841 --> 01:18:21,674
And plus for some people,
alcohol is also a psychomotor 

1411
01:18:23,571 --> 01:18:25,580
stimulants.
So they get ramped up,

1412
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:28,520
especially on the ascending limb of the 
blocked blood alcohol curve.

1413
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:32,930
And then the alcohol knocks out the fear
or inhibition of their behavior.

1414
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:36,470
So it Lord knocks,
knocks out any effect of significance of

1415
01:18:36,471 --> 01:18:37,304
longterm consequences.
Did I thought someone had a question 

1416
01:18:44,761 --> 01:18:45,594
there?
Okay.

1417
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:47,473
By not caring,
you mean like on an ethical level 

1418
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:51,493
because they,
boy,

1419
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:55,340
they must care if they want to 
administer more shock.

1420
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:56,503
Oh,
they don't care about the negative 

1421
01:18:57,141 --> 01:18:57,974
consequences.

1422
01:18:58,090 --> 01:18:59,530
Care,
but flipping.

1423
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:00,291
Oh,
sure.

1424
01:19:00,291 --> 01:19:00,941
That's,
that's,

1425
01:19:00,941 --> 01:19:01,461
you know,
well,

1426
01:19:01,461 --> 01:19:04,940
anger aggression is,
is a positive emotional state in park.

1427
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:07,280
You know,
it's an approach behavior.

1428
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:12,290
So it also activates approach and 
withdrawal circuits.

1429
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:15,320
But if it's successful anger,
there's a,

1430
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:17,450
there's a huge kick in it and that can 
be,

1431
01:19:18,140 --> 01:19:20,900
that can be boosted upwards by,
by alcohol.

1432
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:22,483
So

1433
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:30,920
you don't need alcohol to do that sort 
of thing.

1434
01:19:30,981 --> 01:19:32,450
So I think that

1435
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:33,560
right.
But that was a very,

1436
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:34,720
that was a very,
there were,

1437
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:35,583
there was a very specific condition and 
some of that might also apply in places 

1438
01:19:38,391 --> 01:19:39,600
like fraternities.
Right.

1439
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:45,300
I think elocon innovation for sure.
But I think that also this whole society

1440
01:19:50,491 --> 01:19:55,491
of Internet form and normalizing kind of
violence against women has also,

1441
01:19:56,510 --> 01:19:57,343
like you don't have the societal 
cultural inhibition has also been 

1442
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:04,980
hurricane to remove some of the,

1443
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:08,490
absolutely.
Anyway,

1444
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,930
yeah.
Well I would like to have,

1445
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,020
I would like to continue this 
discussion,

1446
01:20:13,021 --> 01:20:15,030
but let me continue to go through this.
So,

1447
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:16,103
okay.
So,

1448
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:17,573
so what happens after they wake up is 
that they sew fig leaves together and 

1449
01:20:20,251 --> 01:20:21,510
make themselves aprons.
Now,

1450
01:20:21,511 --> 01:20:24,000
I don't know if you know this and you 
probably don't,

1451
01:20:24,001 --> 01:20:28,320
but you know,
every single line of this story has bred

1452
01:20:28,321 --> 01:20:32,100
thousands and thousands of pages and 
thousands and hours of,

1453
01:20:32,101 --> 01:20:36,570
of discussions about what it means.
And this line is no exception.

1454
01:20:36,571 --> 01:20:37,404
And basically what this story says here,
or at least one of the interpretations 

1455
01:20:41,131 --> 01:20:41,964
of the story,
is that as soon as people wake up and 

1456
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:46,470
realize they're naked,
they make clothing and put it on.

1457
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:48,510
And that's culture,
right?

1458
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:52,080
That's so as soon as nakedness is on the
table,

1459
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:53,093
then people put culture between 
themselves and the vision of their 

1460
01:20:57,661 --> 01:20:59,670
evaluators.
And so the,

1461
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,593
the apron is the,
the representative of the fact that as 

1462
01:21:04,381 --> 01:21:06,630
soon as animals wake up and realize 
they're naked,

1463
01:21:06,631 --> 01:21:07,464
they use culture as a,
as a coping mechanism or it's not a 

1464
01:21:10,501 --> 01:21:15,240
coping mechanism as a way of adapting to
that emergent situation.

1465
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:16,733
And you know,
one of the things that people do pretty 

1466
01:21:17,971 --> 01:21:21,780
much worldwide is where clothes now,
it's not a universal,

1467
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:25,710
although it does seem to be a universal 
in so far as clothes are always used,

1468
01:21:25,711 --> 01:21:29,640
at least for decorative purposes.
But in virtually every culture,

1469
01:21:29,641 --> 01:21:32,730
human beings are closed and we have been
for a very long period of time.

1470
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:33,833
Now.
Partly that's because while we don't 

1471
01:21:35,221 --> 01:21:36,054
have any body hair and so we get cold,
especially if we live in northern 

1472
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:41,700
climates or we need to protect herself 
from the sun and so forth.

1473
01:21:41,701 --> 01:21:44,310
But that certainly by no means the only 
reason,

1474
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:45,353
even when we're as modern people were in
temperature can clue controlled 

1475
01:21:48,211 --> 01:21:49,044
climates.
It's not like we're wandering around 

1476
01:21:50,341 --> 01:21:54,000
without our clothes on.
So it's a,

1477
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:55,330
it's a,
it's a,

1478
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:56,333
a form of boundary between ourselves and
the natural world and we immediately 

1479
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:01,530
adopted.

1480
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:03,190
And the reason for that,
I mean the reason,

1481
01:22:03,191 --> 01:22:04,024
the motivational reasons that's laid out
in the stories because people know that 

1482
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:07,003
there know that they're naked,
the transformation produces immediate 

1483
01:22:12,901 --> 01:22:13,734
enlightenment.
Adam and Eve can finally see there now 

1484
01:22:15,871 --> 01:22:16,704
transcended vision produced by 
incorporation of what was forbidden 

1485
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:22,600
produces within them.
Avascular heightened self consciousness,

1486
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:25,290
a terrible catastrophe for limited 
being,

1487
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:28,110
but a preconditioned for genuine 
individual existence.

1488
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:32,370
Adam and eve instantly realize their 
individual naked vulnerability,

1489
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:33,713
a realization that emerges during 
cognitive development at a very young 

1490
01:22:36,121 --> 01:22:36,954
age.
And in fact that the only human being 

1491
01:22:38,411 --> 01:22:40,800
seemed cognizant of in any complex 
sense.

1492
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,010
What does knowledge of naked 
vulnerability mean?

1493
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,550
It means that human beings are painfully
conscious of their limitations.

1494
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:50,760
We know that we are flawed in 
relationship to our ideals.

1495
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,270
We understand that our being is limited 
in place in time.

1496
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:57,690
We know we are vulnerable to death,
disease and insanity.

1497
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:01,950
We know that we can be betrayed by her 
embodied being and undermine socially by

1498
01:23:01,951 --> 01:23:04,380
our peers and even by our friends,
by our friends,

1499
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,430
and all of this makes us ashamed,

1500
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:07,900
fearful.
Unselfconscious.

1501
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:11,020
Now,
next question.

1502
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,530
So when Adam and eve become,
they get there,

1503
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:14,403
they eat this fruit and they figured out
that they're naked and then they put on 

1504
01:23:17,021 --> 01:23:17,854
clothes on clothes on.
But one of the things that the snake 

1505
01:23:19,511 --> 01:23:22,810
tells them is that as soon as they 
become awake,

1506
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:26,530
they're also going to know the 
difference between good and evil.

1507
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:28,660
Now,
I took that long.

1508
01:23:28,690 --> 01:23:32,620
It took me an awful long time to figure 
out what that could possibly meet.

1509
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:35,380
But one of the things that I was trying 
to figure out as well,

1510
01:23:36,730 --> 01:23:37,563
the thing is,
as soon as you know that you're naked 

1511
01:23:38,821 --> 01:23:41,590
and imagine that you can really 
comprehend your limitations,

1512
01:23:41,591 --> 01:23:43,240
you don't really understand what they 
are,

1513
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:48,340
then that means that you understand your
vulnerability or at least to some degree

1514
01:23:48,341 --> 01:23:49,174
that you understand your vulnerability.
And the thing that's so interesting is 

1515
01:23:51,611 --> 01:23:52,444
that the fact that I can understand my 
own vulnerability means that I can be 

1516
01:23:56,261 --> 01:23:57,400
empathic,
right?

1517
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:58,233
Because I can also understand your 
vulnerability and we can mirror that 

1518
01:24:00,581 --> 01:24:02,410
back and forth.
So I would say,

1519
01:24:02,411 --> 01:24:05,710
well that's part of what enables us to 
comprehend good.

1520
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:08,950
But there's a terrible downside to that 
too,

1521
01:24:08,951 --> 01:24:09,784
which is that as soon as I know that I'm
vulnerable and then I know exactly what 

1522
01:24:13,241 --> 01:24:15,970
that means,
I know exactly how I can hurt you.

1523
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:17,493
And that's a hurt that goes beyond what 
animals do when they destroy one 

1524
01:24:19,931 --> 01:24:20,764
another.
Like if a,

1525
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:23,240
if a wolf is trying to take down a a 
cow,

1526
01:24:23,241 --> 01:24:25,630
say it's a pretty hideous process.
You know,

1527
01:24:25,631 --> 01:24:29,050
like the wolves,
the wolves will take pieces of the cow.

1528
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:30,430
Well,
it's standing up.

1529
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:31,563
So it's not that they go in for the kill
and they do it as fast as they possibly 

1530
01:24:34,931 --> 01:24:35,561
can.
I mean,

1531
01:24:35,561 --> 01:24:36,394
they do that,
but only because they don't want to get 

1532
01:24:37,481 --> 01:24:38,860
kicked to death by the cow.

1533
01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:41,380
So it's pretty bloody awful.
And you know,

1534
01:24:41,381 --> 01:24:42,214
if you,
if you've ever read about Mya 

1535
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:47,800
chimpanzees hunting colobus monkeys for 
example,

1536
01:24:47,801 --> 01:24:50,410
that's a pretty brutal situation.
Cause the chimps,

1537
01:24:50,411 --> 01:24:51,244
we'll catch the call us monkeys,
which weigh about 38 pounds and tear 

1538
01:24:54,341 --> 01:24:56,560
them to pieces and eat them while 
they're still alive.

1539
01:24:56,770 --> 01:25:00,370
So they're like screaming madly away.
It doesn't stop the chimps at all.

1540
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:05,770
So it's not like predation in the wild 
is brief and,

1541
01:25:05,950 --> 01:25:06,783
and,
and a merciful by any sort of natural 

1542
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:11,343
order,
but it's no more horrible than it 

1543
01:25:13,211 --> 01:25:14,470
happens.
It has to be.

1544
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:18,490
Whereas with people,
that's a whole different story,

1545
01:25:18,970 --> 01:25:19,661
you know?
So if,

1546
01:25:19,661 --> 01:25:21,100
I mean,
if you,

1547
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:23,680
if people have been torturing each 
other,

1548
01:25:23,681 --> 01:25:26,860
especially in warfare for a very,
very long period of time,

1549
01:25:27,190 --> 01:25:28,023
you know,
and there are certainly in tribal 

1550
01:25:30,341 --> 01:25:33,220
warfare in particular,
I mean one of the things that the tribes

1551
01:25:33,221 --> 01:25:34,054
pride themselves on is the ability to 
keep a captured soldier long alive for 

1552
01:25:38,171 --> 01:25:39,004
the longest period of time possible.
Well torturing him in the most painful 

1553
01:25:42,671 --> 01:25:46,900
way possible.
And so that can mean weeks and you can't

1554
01:25:46,901 --> 01:25:47,734
understand exactly how to take someone 
else apart in every possible way that 

1555
01:25:51,101 --> 01:25:54,970
you can take someone apart until you 
understand how you could be taken apart.

1556
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:58,930
And so I think that as soon as you do 
recognize your own vulnerability,

1557
01:25:58,931 --> 01:25:59,764
you have transcended mere good and bad 
and moved into the domain of good and 

1558
01:26:03,681 --> 01:26:04,514
evil.

1559
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:07,760
So cause you can treat someone else like
you would want to be treated.

1560
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:08,803
But you can also,
there's no limits to your imagination 

1561
01:26:11,691 --> 01:26:13,370
for cruelty.
I mean,

1562
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:15,140
and there are truly no limits.

1563
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:16,243
I mean

1564
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:18,283
you see in situations like,
I don't know if you've ever read the 

1565
01:26:20,751 --> 01:26:25,190
book the Rape of Nan King,
but that's a truly horrifying book.

1566
01:26:25,191 --> 01:26:28,270
The Rape Nan King.
And it's about what happened when Japan

1567
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:32,980
occupied China during the Second World 
War.

1568
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:36,010
The estimates are that some three to 
400,000

1569
01:26:36,011 --> 01:26:40,000
people were raped and brutalized and 
tortured in Nan king.

1570
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:41,283
And what seemed to happen was the 
Japanese soldiers at that time were 

1571
01:26:44,141 --> 01:26:48,310
products of the Prussian military school
because the Japanese and adopted that as

1572
01:26:48,311 --> 01:26:49,144
their model.
And they were basically taught that 

1573
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:53,650
everyone who wasn't Japanese was 
subhuman.

1574
01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:54,723
And it's pretty easy to teach people 
that because you can teach people that 

1575
01:26:57,461 --> 01:27:01,030
those people who aren't them are 
subhuman at the drop of a hat.

1576
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:03,730
I mean it's,
it's a natural way for us to think.

1577
01:27:04,330 --> 01:27:07,540
And so when the Japanese went into Nan 
king,

1578
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:11,230
there was no limit on what they were 
allowed to do to the Chinese.

1579
01:27:11,231 --> 01:27:12,064
And what basically happened was,
you can imagine this because people can 

1580
01:27:14,351 --> 01:27:15,184
imitate.
What basically happened was you could 

1581
01:27:16,661 --> 01:27:17,494
take the most psychopathic,
single Japanese soldier that you could 

1582
01:27:20,441 --> 01:27:21,274
possibly imagine.
And then find a group those and then 

1583
01:27:23,951 --> 01:27:28,570
find the one person who had the most 
vivid imagination for may have an eval.

1584
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:33,130
And then you could imagine him setting 
the tone for the entire occupation.

1585
01:27:33,610 --> 01:27:37,570
And that's exactly what happened.
It was competitive brutality.

1586
01:27:38,850 --> 01:27:39,683
And so,

1587
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:41,983
and you don't get at competitive 
brutality until you understand exactly 

1588
01:27:44,631 --> 01:27:45,464
what you're doing and you don't 
understand what you're doing until you 

1589
01:27:47,181 --> 01:27:48,014
know how people can be hurt.
And you don't understand that until you 

1590
01:27:50,871 --> 01:27:51,704
know how you can be hurt.
And so that's also an emergent 

1591
01:27:53,961 --> 01:27:55,670
consequence of self consciousness

1592
01:27:58,060 --> 01:27:59,440
now.
So you might think,

1593
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:00,490
well,
is there any,

1594
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:04,390
is there any support in this story for 
such a hypothesis?

1595
01:28:04,391 --> 01:28:05,224
Well,
I think that thing that comes next 

1596
01:28:06,041 --> 01:28:06,940
supports it.
So,

1597
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:12,280
and this is another part of this story 
that I think is by no means patriarchal.

1598
01:28:12,290 --> 01:28:16,800
I think it's exactly the opposite.
So one of the things that gender,

1599
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:18,940
while I'll read you the,
or read the story.

1600
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:22,330
So now they've,
they've found out they're naked and they

1601
01:28:22,331 --> 01:28:25,480
covered themselves up.
And so now God comes walking through the

1602
01:28:25,481 --> 01:28:30,160
garden and Adam and eve heard the voice 
of the Lord God walking in the garden in

1603
01:28:30,161 --> 01:28:30,994
the cool of the day.
And Adam and his wife hid themselves 

1604
01:28:33,611 --> 01:28:36,340
from the presence of the Lord God 
amongst the trees of the garden.

1605
01:28:36,730 --> 01:28:40,060
So they hadn't been doing that before,
so it hadn't been hiding from God.

1606
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:44,590
So now what we have is the idea that as 
soon as people become vulnerable,

1607
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:46,090
they hide from God.

1608
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:47,493
And I believe that to be as close to 
literally true as anything that you can 

1609
01:28:50,261 --> 01:28:51,094
really utr.
And I'll talk about why that is in a 

1610
01:28:52,451 --> 01:28:53,284
moment.
And the Lord God called Unto Adam and 

1611
01:28:55,691 --> 01:28:57,610
said unto him,
where Art Thou?

1612
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,490
And he said,
I heard dive voice in the garden.

1613
01:29:00,491 --> 01:29:03,660
And I was because I was naked.
So I hid myself.

1614
01:29:04,890 --> 01:29:07,440
And God said,
who told you that you were naked?

1615
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:08,693
Have you eaten of the tree?
Whereof I commanded thee that thou 

1616
01:29:10,501 --> 01:29:12,510
should not eat.
And the man said,

1617
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:17,600
the woman whom thou gave us to be with,
she gave me of the tree and I did eat.

1618
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:19,110
Okay.
So that's,

1619
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:20,123
that's an amazing story.
So the first thing that happens is 

1620
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,333
there's an intimation that before the 
emergence of self consciousness that 

1621
01:29:25,681 --> 01:29:27,690
human beings walked with God in the 
garden.

1622
01:29:27,990 --> 01:29:28,823
And so there was an unbroken line of 
communication in some sense between the 

1623
01:29:32,810 --> 01:29:35,520
creature and the divine totality.

1624
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:36,383
It's the link was not broken.
Now one of the things that's 

1625
01:29:39,061 --> 01:29:41,850
characteristic of the Shamana trends 
tradition,

1626
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:44,910
and this seems to be an idea that's 
basically spread worldwide,

1627
01:29:44,911 --> 01:29:45,744
is that there was a time back in time 
when the connection between heaven and 

1628
01:29:50,191 --> 01:29:51,024
earth was unbroken.
And the idea that there's a fall and 

1629
01:29:53,581 --> 01:29:58,260
that the fall involves a tree and a 
snake is unbelievably well distributed.

1630
01:29:58,710 --> 01:29:59,543
It's ridiculously well distributed.
So now that might be because maybe that 

1631
01:30:03,271 --> 01:30:06,030
was the story that we all knew before 
the diaspora,

1632
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:08,160
you know,
before the diaspora out of Africa.

1633
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,100
And that people have just been retelling
it forever since,

1634
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,113
since then,
so many hundreds of thousands of years 

1635
01:30:13,561 --> 01:30:14,394
ago.
Or it might be that it's a story that's 

1636
01:30:15,601 --> 01:30:18,180
so built into our architecture that,
you know,

1637
01:30:18,181 --> 01:30:21,270
when we,
when we come up across approximations of

1638
01:30:21,271 --> 01:30:23,850
it in,
in stories that people tell one another,

1639
01:30:23,910 --> 01:30:28,260
that it rings true somehow and we 
collected recollected and retell it.

1640
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:33,530
Nobody really knows.
But so what happens is that there's this

1641
01:30:34,081 --> 01:30:34,914
idea of unbroken communication between 
Adam and eve before the development of 

1642
01:30:37,981 --> 01:30:38,814
self consciousness.
But then self consciousness emerges and 

1643
01:30:40,681 --> 01:30:43,440
they both realize they're naked and then
they covered themselves up.

1644
01:30:43,710 --> 01:30:46,800
But then the next thing that happens is 
that they hide from God.

1645
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:49,260
Now you didn't know.
It's pretty primitive.

1646
01:30:49,261 --> 01:30:50,094
It's really,
I think this part of the story is 

1647
01:30:50,941 --> 01:30:51,774
actually a comedy because they're,
they're really acting in a very 

1648
01:30:54,511 --> 01:30:55,770
brainless manor.
It's like,

1649
01:30:55,771 --> 01:30:57,300
first of all,
what are they going to do?

1650
01:30:57,301 --> 01:30:58,134
They're hiding from God behind trees.
That strikes me that that's a very 

1651
01:31:00,421 --> 01:31:01,254
ineffective way of hiding from God since
he can probably see three trees and if 

1652
01:31:04,021 --> 01:31:05,790
they thought about it for two tenths of 
a second,

1653
01:31:05,791 --> 01:31:07,440
they'd figure that out.
Right?

1654
01:31:07,441 --> 01:31:09,420
So they might be conscious and self 
conscious,

1655
01:31:09,421 --> 01:31:11,490
but they're,
they're not really very bright yet.

1656
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:12,863
And then God calls Adam on it.
And the first thing Adam does is blame 

1657
01:31:17,190 --> 01:31:20,280
the woman,
which isn't exactly the opposite of what

1658
01:31:20,281 --> 01:31:21,114
you just,
you would expect from a patriarchal 

1659
01:31:22,141 --> 01:31:26,040
story as far as I'm concerned because he
comes across as a complete Dweeb,

1660
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:27,941
you know,
I mean he,

1661
01:31:27,941 --> 01:31:28,780
he,
he wouldn't do,

1662
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:31,740
you would think that if the writers of 
this story would have wanted to,

1663
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:32,933
wanted men to look particularly good,
that Adam would have stood up and 

1664
01:31:36,781 --> 01:31:37,590
protected,
eat,

1665
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:40,020
not ratted her out the first possible 
moment.

1666
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:41,730
So,
but I think,

1667
01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:45,750
I think that men do complain to God that
women make themselves conscious.

1668
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:46,913
I think they do that all the time.
And I think that manifests itself in 

1669
01:31:50,011 --> 01:31:50,844
resentment and,
and especially if they're not being 

1670
01:31:53,101 --> 01:31:54,930
successful in,
in the,

1671
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:57,450
in the game of attracting female 
attention.

1672
01:31:58,320 --> 01:31:59,153
So they complained to God all the time 
about the fact that women are making 

1673
01:32:01,871 --> 01:32:05,530
them self conscious and that produces a 
tremendous amount of resentment.

1674
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:08,710
So anyways,
the man says,

1675
01:32:08,711 --> 01:32:10,720
the woman who,
the woman who you gave to me.

1676
01:32:10,721 --> 01:32:12,700
So he blames God too,
which I think is pretty funny.

1677
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:13,863
She gave me of the tree and I did eat.
So now there's a deeper meaning here 

1678
01:32:17,891 --> 01:32:18,724
too,
which is that the reason that human 

1679
01:32:19,751 --> 01:32:20,584
beings no longer walk with God is 
because they're embarrassed about their 

1680
01:32:23,141 --> 01:32:23,974
own vulnerability.
And I also believe that to be the case 

1681
01:32:26,231 --> 01:32:27,970
because you know,
when you think

1682
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:36,880
it isn't only the worst of ourselves 
that we hide from each other,

1683
01:32:36,881 --> 01:32:39,070
it's also the best of ourselves.
And I think,

1684
01:32:39,071 --> 01:32:39,904
in fact,
we're more likely to hide the best of 

1685
01:32:41,021 --> 01:32:41,854
ourselves in the worst because like if I
manifest the worst of myself socially 

1686
01:32:45,191 --> 01:32:46,570
and it gets rejected,
it's like,

1687
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:47,890
well,
who the hell cares about that?

1688
01:32:48,370 --> 01:32:51,880
You know?
It's like that's my second rate attempt.

1689
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:54,800
And it's not something I'm particularly 
proud of anyways.

1690
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:55,451
And if,
you know,

1691
01:32:55,451 --> 01:32:58,030
if you're not that happy about it,
well it's not the real me.

1692
01:32:58,031 --> 01:33:01,750
And so who cares?
But where are your most vulnerable is if

1693
01:33:01,751 --> 01:33:02,584
you try to do something that's as good 
as you can do and you lay that out for 

1694
01:33:05,711 --> 01:33:06,544
public evaluation.
And that's why neat you said for 

1695
01:33:08,651 --> 01:33:09,484
example,
that if you really want to punish 

1696
01:33:10,271 --> 01:33:11,980
someone,
you punish them for their virtues,

1697
01:33:11,981 --> 01:33:12,814
not for their faults.
And so people are afraid of letting 

1698
01:33:15,551 --> 01:33:19,750
their virtues be seen because that 
really reveals their vulnerability,

1699
01:33:19,751 --> 01:33:22,990
like that reveals the true extent of 
their potential big.

1700
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:24,153
And that's something that someone who 
has the motivation could immediately 

1701
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:30,490
capitalize on and tortured them to death
for.

1702
01:33:30,491 --> 01:33:31,324
And I think like that's basically the 
plot of every high school coming of age 

1703
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:37,090
movie that's ever been made so

1704
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:51,370
well now they've done it.
So God says,

1705
01:33:53,150 --> 01:33:53,983
I read here,
let me read this because I thought this 

1706
01:33:55,641 --> 01:33:56,474
was pretty funny.

1707
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:00,583
Self conscious knowledge of 
vulnerability makes the individual too 

1708
01:34:02,691 --> 01:34:06,620
afraid to walk with God.
This is avoidance of meaning,

1709
01:34:06,621 --> 01:34:07,454
responsibility and destiny.
Such avoidance has catastrophic 

1710
01:34:10,281 --> 01:34:14,240
consequences.
Existence properly undertaken produces a

1711
01:34:14,241 --> 01:34:15,074
condition of being that makes knowledge 
of find a tude tolerable that properly 

1712
01:34:18,651 --> 01:34:19,484
undertaking undertaken existence means 
the embodiment of logos in spite of 

1713
01:34:22,731 --> 01:34:23,564
vulnerability to hide from God as a 
consequence of revealed nakedness is to 

1714
01:34:27,771 --> 01:34:28,604
destroy the incarnation of logos and to 
immediately become subject to the 

1715
01:34:31,371 --> 01:34:35,030
privations of merely human existence.
Adam's sin,

1716
01:34:35,031 --> 01:34:35,864
which is partly his curiosity,
inspired rebellion is also more than 

1717
01:34:38,751 --> 01:34:39,584
that.
And what is more may also be more 

1718
01:34:41,181 --> 01:34:42,014
significant.
Adam refuses to continue his 

1719
01:34:44,631 --> 01:34:45,464
relationship with logos because he is 
awake and afraid and he believed he 

1720
01:34:49,461 --> 01:34:50,294
blames the architect,
architect of femininity eve for his 

1721
01:34:53,061 --> 01:34:55,220
enlightened cowardice.
After all,

1722
01:34:55,221 --> 01:34:59,720
she made him self conscious.
His immediate abandonment of courage and

1723
01:34:59,721 --> 01:35:03,050
responsibility endears him neither to 
God nor to woman.

1724
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,273
Perhaps this is the real sin of Adam.
Had he not compromised himself further 

1725
01:35:07,941 --> 01:35:10,730
after eating the apple,
God might have relented and allowed them

1726
01:35:10,731 --> 01:35:11,564
to stay in paradise and that's not a 
reading of of genesis that I've ever 

1727
01:35:15,351 --> 01:35:19,190
really come across because the sin has 
always presented as the original eating.

1728
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,890
But you know,
he acts pretty damn reprehensive Lee.

1729
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:26,120
In fact as badly as you possibly could 
under circumstances like that.

1730
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:29,420
So,
and it's certainly the case that women,

1731
01:35:29,450 --> 01:35:30,283
men acting towards women in that manner,
blaming them for their own self 

1732
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:34,394
conscious vulnerability is is definitely
a major source of avoidable strife 

1733
01:35:38,331 --> 01:35:40,910
throughout the world and has been for,
you know,

1734
01:35:40,911 --> 01:35:44,570
all of the centuries that we've been in 
self conscious association with women

1735
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:52,970
about the letter of the law.

1736
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:00,901
Yeah,
well I think,

1737
01:36:00,901 --> 01:36:02,670
I think that's right.
So,

1738
01:36:02,671 --> 01:36:03,870
okay,
so what happens?

1739
01:36:03,871 --> 01:36:05,910
Well,
what happens is what you'd expect.

1740
01:36:05,911 --> 01:36:09,330
God just lays out the the consequences 
of this.

1741
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:10,733
And he says,

1742
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:11,950
okay,

1743
01:36:11,950 --> 01:36:13,120
unto the woman,
he said,

1744
01:36:13,121 --> 01:36:13,954
I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and 
die conception in sorrow shalt thou 

1745
01:36:17,801 --> 01:36:22,750
bring forth children and I desire shall 
be to die husband and he shall rule over

1746
01:36:22,751 --> 01:36:25,870
thee.
Now it's often read is that's often read

1747
01:36:25,871 --> 01:36:30,871
as again as a patriarchal statement that
God punishes women by dooming them to be

1748
01:36:32,381 --> 01:36:33,214
ruled by men.
But I don't think that that's what it 

1749
01:36:34,421 --> 01:36:36,220
says it all.
What it says basically as,

1750
01:36:36,221 --> 01:36:37,054
okay,
well a sequence of events has just 

1751
01:36:38,021 --> 01:36:38,854
occurred.
The sequence of events is that event 

1752
01:36:40,901 --> 01:36:41,734
which,
which,

1753
01:36:41,950 --> 01:36:44,560
which caused the emergence of self 
consciousness.

1754
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:48,070
Now we can assume that that was 
associated with cortical expansion.

1755
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,473
So one of the things we know that 
happened during cortical expansion is 

1756
01:36:51,611 --> 01:36:52,444
that the baby's head became sedan big,
that it could hardly get out during 

1757
01:36:54,580 --> 01:36:57,610
childbirth.
So there's been a bunch of physiological

1758
01:36:57,611 --> 01:36:58,660
consequences of that.

1759
01:36:58,870 --> 01:36:59,703
One is women's hips are wider than men.
If they were any wider women couldn't 

1760
01:37:03,731 --> 01:37:04,564
run.
So women hit the limits of hip 

1761
01:37:06,881 --> 01:37:10,200
expansion.
And so the hip expansion helped,

1762
01:37:10,210 --> 01:37:15,210
made the pelvic pelvic gap through which
the baby is born sufficiently large.

1763
01:37:16,721 --> 01:37:20,020
So they had could get through but barely
like seriously,

1764
01:37:20,021 --> 01:37:20,854
barely.
And that's why there's partly why there 

1765
01:37:21,741 --> 01:37:22,574
are so many [inaudible] in sections.
But one of the other consequences of 

1766
01:37:25,421 --> 01:37:26,560
that,
there were a couple of them.

1767
01:37:26,561 --> 01:37:29,230
One is babies are born way younger than 
they should be.

1768
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:30,393
So for a mammal of our size,
women should have a gestation period of 

1769
01:37:32,981 --> 01:37:34,630
two years,
not nine months.

1770
01:37:34,930 --> 01:37:39,910
So babies are born fetal.
And the second is that the baby's head,

1771
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:43,780
the bones in the head aren't,
are grown together.

1772
01:37:43,781 --> 01:37:44,614
And so one of the things that happens 
during birth is the baby's head 

1773
01:37:46,421 --> 01:37:49,000
compresses and it compresses a lot.

1774
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,880
Like when a baby comes out,
it actually can be its head,

1775
01:37:51,881 --> 01:37:52,714
can normal speak cone shaped because of 
the tremendous that's crushing the head 

1776
01:37:56,851 --> 01:37:59,610
during the birth process.
And so birth is very,

1777
01:37:59,611 --> 01:38:02,580
very painful for human beings and it's 
very,

1778
01:38:02,581 --> 01:38:04,140
very dangerous.
And you know,

1779
01:38:04,141 --> 01:38:09,141
part of the human story is that the hero
is always threatened at birth.

1780
01:38:09,630 --> 01:38:10,463
And the reason for that,
the reason that that's true among human 

1781
01:38:12,061 --> 01:38:14,880
beings is because human babies are 
unbelievably vulnerable.

1782
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:16,133
You know,
and even at birth they're highly likely 

1783
01:38:17,671 --> 01:38:18,504
to die.
Child mortality has been a terrible 

1784
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:24,540
burden on humanity while really up until
the last century,

1785
01:38:24,541 --> 01:38:25,374
you know,
and child mortality rates have been 

1786
01:38:26,161 --> 01:38:29,370
plummeting like mad in developed 
countries over the last 10 years.

1787
01:38:29,371 --> 01:38:32,250
But you know,
prior to the 20th century,

1788
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,380
children die didn't,
but the majority of children died.

1789
01:38:36,430 --> 01:38:37,263
Women died in childbirth all the time.
So the idea that women were going to 

1790
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:42,473
have sorrow in childbirth and in 
conception doesn't seem to me to be 

1791
01:38:46,531 --> 01:38:48,630
precisely a divine doctrine.

1792
01:38:48,630 --> 01:38:51,390
It's just an observation of exactly what
was going to happen.

1793
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:54,390
So,
and then,

1794
01:38:54,391 --> 01:38:55,710
you know,
once the baby's born,

1795
01:38:55,711 --> 01:38:56,544
the same damn problem emerges because 
the baby so premature and so helpless 

1796
01:38:59,970 --> 01:39:00,803
that the woman is basically doomed to be
nonself sufficient for a reasonably 

1797
01:39:06,271 --> 01:39:08,400
extensive period of time.
And so we could say,

1798
01:39:08,401 --> 01:39:13,401
well that's at least until the baby is,
I would say five absolutely minimum.

1799
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:14,843
You know,
even chimps carry their babies around 

1800
01:39:16,021 --> 01:39:18,630
for about three years with one hand,
you know,

1801
01:39:18,631 --> 01:39:20,970
so they're,
the females are down to one arm.

1802
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:22,253
And so human mothers are at a tremendous
disadvantage in the immediate aftermath 

1803
01:39:26,341 --> 01:39:27,174
of birth.
And part of the consequence of that is 

1804
01:39:28,651 --> 01:39:30,540
that they're doomed to be reliant on 
men.

1805
01:39:30,690 --> 01:39:32,640
What the hell else could possibly 
happen?

1806
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:33,713
I mean,
the women put themselves together in 

1807
01:39:34,681 --> 01:39:38,690
groups and try to support each other 
during pregnancy and childbirth.

1808
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:41,070
And that happens in multiview most human
societies.

1809
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:44,850
But it still boils down to the fact that
in order to redress the balance,

1810
01:39:44,851 --> 01:39:45,684
the woman ends up dependent on a man.
And one of the consequences of that is 

1811
01:39:48,871 --> 01:39:49,860
that,
you know,

1812
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,820
he's got more power than she does.
And so it's a,

1813
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:56,220
it's a statement of destiny rather than 
a sentence of,

1814
01:39:56,490 --> 01:39:58,830
of revenge.
And Unto Adam,

1815
01:39:58,831 --> 01:39:59,664
he said,
because you have hearkened unto the 

1816
01:40:00,541 --> 01:40:02,460
voice of your wife and have eaten of the
tree,

1817
01:40:02,461 --> 01:40:03,294
which I commanded thee,
saying thou shall not eat of it cursed 

1818
01:40:05,881 --> 01:40:08,370
it is the ground for the ice sake in 
sorrow,

1819
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:12,510
shelldale eat of it all die days of the 
life of the life of thy life.

1820
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:13,763
Thorns also and thistles shall it bring 
forth to thee and thou shall eat the 

1821
01:40:16,801 --> 01:40:19,230
herb of the field in the sweat of the 
face.

1822
01:40:19,231 --> 01:40:23,060
THY face shalt thou eat bread till thou 
return unto the ground for out of it,

1823
01:40:23,070 --> 01:40:25,620
West thou taken for Dusko Art and unto 
dust,

1824
01:40:25,650 --> 01:40:28,740
thou shall return pretty damn dismal.

1825
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:29,753
I mean,
the women get knocked really hard to 

1826
01:40:30,781 --> 01:40:31,614
begin with,
but it's not like the men get away Scot 

1827
01:40:33,091 --> 01:40:33,924
free.
Basically that the statement of the 

1828
01:40:37,441 --> 01:40:38,274
consequence of the emergence of self 
consciousness is that men are doomed to 

1829
01:40:42,961 --> 01:40:43,794
toil their entire life and then to die.
And I also think that that's not 

1830
01:40:47,491 --> 01:40:51,480
something that characterizes any other 
animal because human beings work.

1831
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:52,973
And the reason we work is because we're 
conscious of the future and we're 

1832
01:40:55,241 --> 01:40:58,360
conscious of all the potential 
catastrophes the future can bring,

1833
01:40:58,450 --> 01:41:00,520
including the catastrophes for our 
family.

1834
01:41:01,030 --> 01:41:01,863
And so the consequence of that is that 
instead of being directly immersed in 

1835
01:41:04,841 --> 01:41:05,674
the pleasures of the moment,
people always have to forego those 

1836
01:41:09,131 --> 01:41:09,964
pleasures to,
to stave off the potential array of 

1837
01:41:12,761 --> 01:41:16,270
future catastrophes that were firmly 
aware of because we're self conscious.

1838
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:19,380
And so that's when history starts,
you know,

1839
01:41:19,381 --> 01:41:20,214
and the fundamentalist say,
well the world began when God created 

1840
01:41:23,171 --> 01:41:24,610
the world after seven days.

1841
01:41:24,610 --> 01:41:25,443
You know?
And the funny thing is is that there's 

1842
01:41:26,591 --> 01:41:27,424
an element of that that's true.
History does not begin until human 

1843
01:41:30,731 --> 01:41:35,530
beings become self conscious before that
it's mere unconscious animal existence.

1844
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:36,933
And so to some degree,
the emergence of self consciousness is 

1845
01:41:38,831 --> 01:41:42,820
the beginning of the being that we would
consider specifically human being.

1846
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:44,433
So,
and exactly what that means on a cosmic 

1847
01:41:46,031 --> 01:41:49,180
level is no,
no one can be certain of that because we

1848
01:41:49,181 --> 01:41:51,940
don't understand the relationship 
between consciousness.

1849
01:41:51,941 --> 01:41:52,774
And being so on one the one end you can 
think of us as occupying some little 

1850
01:41:55,991 --> 01:41:56,824
speck of dust at the corner of some 
irrelevant galaxy and an infinite 

1851
01:41:59,711 --> 01:42:02,050
universe.
But by the same token,

1852
01:42:02,051 --> 01:42:02,884
we're also,
this is the only place that we know of 

1853
01:42:04,241 --> 01:42:08,320
where consciousness exists.
And if consciousness is,

1854
01:42:08,510 --> 01:42:10,960
if,
if being is dependent on consciousness,

1855
01:42:10,961 --> 01:42:13,510
and I think that you can make a very 
strong case that it is,

1856
01:42:13,511 --> 01:42:14,344
then there's no reason to assume that 
this isn't the center of things despite 

1857
01:42:17,981 --> 01:42:19,000
the,
you know,

1858
01:42:19,001 --> 01:42:22,390
despite our reinterpretation of that 
over the last 300 years.

1859
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:28,703
So the god,
therefore the Lord God sent him forth 

1860
01:42:30,841 --> 01:42:33,720
from the garden of Eden to till the 
ground from whence he was taken.

1861
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:38,190
So we drove out the man and placed at 
the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims

1862
01:42:38,191 --> 01:42:39,024
and a flaming sword,
which turned every way to keep the way 

1863
01:42:40,830 --> 01:42:43,710
of the tree of life.
So there's no going back.

1864
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:45,353
You know,
it's funny because one of the classic 

1865
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:51,800
Shamonic mythologies is the attempt to 
go back to get the tree of life,

1866
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:55,350
to get the fruit of the tree of life.
And you can see that in Gilgamesh,

1867
01:42:55,351 --> 01:42:56,184
for example,
which is a story that's either an older 

1868
01:42:57,961 --> 01:42:58,794
than the Enuma elish.
So Gilgamesh goes to the bottom of the 

1869
01:43:01,621 --> 01:43:04,200
ocean.
So he goes to the bottom of being itself

1870
01:43:04,201 --> 01:43:08,670
in one of his heroic ventures to grab 
the herb of immortality,

1871
01:43:08,671 --> 01:43:09,504
but he loses it on the way up.
And there's an idea in the shamanic 

1872
01:43:12,871 --> 01:43:16,260
traditions that when the [inaudible] are
going up and down the tree of life,

1873
01:43:16,261 --> 01:43:17,094
that one of the things they're trying to
do is to go into this heavenly realm to 

1874
01:43:20,191 --> 01:43:23,970
bring back that which will confer 
immortality upon people.

1875
01:43:23,971 --> 01:43:24,804
But there's no,
no one has been successful at doing 

1876
01:43:26,821 --> 01:43:28,350
that.
And that's a very,

1877
01:43:28,351 --> 01:43:31,560
very widespread story.
And there's also something to it.

1878
01:43:31,890 --> 01:43:32,723
Something I don't understand,
but there's something about it that's 

1879
01:43:34,651 --> 01:43:35,484
accurate.

1880
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:46,320
Right,
right,

1881
01:43:50,910 --> 01:43:52,630
right,
right.

1882
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:57,673
Yeah.

1883
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:01,080
Well,
the fact that the story,

1884
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:05,520
the story suggests that there's is a way
of obtaining it,

1885
01:44:05,521 --> 01:44:09,570
mortality that people have been able to 
voyage to but not to bring back.

1886
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:11,753
So,
and that's a failed hero story happens 

1887
01:44:13,021 --> 01:44:13,854
all the time.
It's like the person who goes to fight 

1888
01:44:16,261 --> 01:44:17,094
with the dragon to get the goal but 
can't bring the gold back or ends up 

1889
01:44:19,441 --> 01:44:22,380
inside the dragons belly.
It's a failed hero story.

1890
01:44:22,770 --> 01:44:23,970
And Gilgamesh,
for example,

1891
01:44:23,971 --> 01:44:28,080
is a failed hero's story.
Now the story is,

1892
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:29,033
one of the things that happens in 
Christianity is that there's a twist in 

1893
01:44:32,041 --> 01:44:37,041
the failed hero story because Christ 
dies and then comes back.

1894
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:38,933
And so there's this,
there's this idea in Christianity that 

1895
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,120
voluntary death solves the problem of 
death.

1896
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:50,160
So yeah,

1897
01:44:54,210 --> 01:44:58,770
I don't think that's an or question.
I think it's an end question.

1898
01:44:59,430 --> 01:45:00,263
I actually think that it requires both,
but I don't exactly know what that 

1899
01:45:04,471 --> 01:45:05,304
means.

1900
01:45:06,190 --> 01:45:06,730
Okay.

1901
01:45:06,730 --> 01:45:08,390
So like there's,
there's,

1902
01:45:08,410 --> 01:45:09,243
there's an,
there was a very old idea that the way 

1903
01:45:11,201 --> 01:45:12,034
to overcome death is to accept it,
but it isn't exactly clear what except 

1904
01:45:16,331 --> 01:45:17,164
means.
Obviously it means to accept it on a 

1905
01:45:18,931 --> 01:45:20,840
metaphysical level,
which is to say,

1906
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:24,680
to not deny the validity of being merely
because your finite.

1907
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:26,473
But I don't think that's all it means 
because I think most of these stories 

1908
01:45:29,361 --> 01:45:30,194
have a reality that plays itself out at 
the level of the material reality that 

1909
01:45:33,921 --> 01:45:35,870
we're familiar with and day to day 
existence.

1910
01:45:36,050 --> 01:45:36,883
And if the metaphysical plane at the 
same time at that somehow those are the 

1911
01:45:40,281 --> 01:45:41,114
same thing.
There's in some way that we don't 

1912
01:45:42,531 --> 01:45:43,364
understand.
So I've had strong intimations that 

1913
01:45:46,820 --> 01:45:49,040
death is partly a repair mechanism.

1914
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:51,753
So

1915
01:45:52,230 --> 01:45:55,120
I mean one of the things that seems to 
happen when you go to sleep at night,

1916
01:45:55,121 --> 01:45:56,020
that that's,
that's,

1917
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:59,320
that's something that that brings you 
close to death.

1918
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:03,610
Your consciousness certainly disappears 
and the deeper you go into sleep,

1919
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:04,593
it's only in the deepest,
deepest stages of sleep that your body 

1920
01:46:07,211 --> 01:46:10,810
produces human growth hormone and does 
the repairs that are necessary.

1921
01:46:11,110 --> 01:46:11,943
So you have to be,
you have to become extraordinarily 

1922
01:46:13,661 --> 01:46:18,661
relaxed and let go of everything in 
order to enter a physiological condition

1923
01:46:18,971 --> 01:46:19,804
where you can be optimally restructured.
And I don't know how deep you can go 

1924
01:46:24,041 --> 01:46:24,874
into that.

1925
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:29,980
There seems to be a diametric opposition
analysis,

1926
01:46:30,610 --> 01:46:31,443
mystical realm.
So perhaps definitely one that needs to 

1927
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:36,873
emerge.

1928
01:46:37,550 --> 01:46:38,151
Well,
it served.

1929
01:46:38,151 --> 01:46:40,040
That certainly does happen when you go 
to sleep.

1930
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:41,293
I mean,
you leave the realm of normal day to 

1931
01:46:43,190 --> 01:46:44,023
day,
individual wakefulness and you descend 

1932
01:46:46,911 --> 01:46:50,250
into a realm of fantasy and,

1933
01:46:50,630 --> 01:46:52,930
and immobility.
And so there's,

1934
01:46:52,940 --> 01:46:53,790
there's a,
there's a,

1935
01:46:53,850 --> 01:46:58,710
there's a sick click interconnection 
between those two states of being,

1936
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:00,293
you know,
and it's certainly the case that when 

1937
01:47:01,950 --> 01:47:02,783
people become unhealthy that their sleep
wake cycles become tremendously 

1938
01:47:07,681 --> 01:47:08,514
disrupted.
They don't sleep properly anymore and 

1939
01:47:09,781 --> 01:47:12,090
then they really start to age and 
disintegrate.

1940
01:47:12,930 --> 01:47:17,930
So,
all right,

1941
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:20,430
so that's that.
Now I want to tell you this,

1942
01:47:20,431 --> 01:47:22,140
Cain and Abel Story.
So,

1943
01:47:22,141 --> 01:47:22,974
and then,
Yup.

1944
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:26,593
What do you mean?

1945
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:40,771
Well,
you know,

1946
01:47:40,771 --> 01:47:42,900
when I placed these talks on the 
Internet,

1947
01:47:42,901 --> 01:47:45,870
people will criticize them and say that 
I'm stretching,

1948
01:47:46,910 --> 01:47:48,480
you know,
that I'm attempting to,

1949
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:53,900
to use scientific evidence to justify 
the reality of these stories.

1950
01:47:54,930 --> 01:47:57,090
So I don't mean,
I don't think that is what I'm trying to

1951
01:47:57,091 --> 01:47:57,924
do.
I think what I'm trying to do is to 

1952
01:47:58,501 --> 01:48:00,570
figure out what the hell these stories 
mean.

1953
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:03,420
I think the reason that the,
that the,

1954
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:04,583
the,
um,

1955
01:48:04,710 --> 01:48:07,620
isomorphism is there is because these 
stories are true.

1956
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:10,950
I just don't think we know what that 
means.

1957
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:14,673
So would you expect this,
particularly this one or maybe if we 

1958
01:48:18,101 --> 01:48:19,160
look closer at,

1959
01:48:24,730 --> 01:48:27,430
well,
I can tell you that the story,

1960
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:31,540
I'm going to try to get to it.
We missed a lecture unfortunately.

1961
01:48:31,541 --> 01:48:34,990
But what are the stories I wanted to 
tell you is the story of Buddha.

1962
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:37,113
The Buddhist story is exactly the same 
story as the story in genesis plus the 

1963
01:48:41,561 --> 01:48:44,500
story of the reincarnation of,
or the resurrection of Christ.

1964
01:48:44,590 --> 01:48:48,490
It's the same story.
And Buddha obtains enlightenment under a

1965
01:48:48,491 --> 01:48:50,140
tree.
You know,

1966
01:48:50,141 --> 01:48:52,950
Christ attains enlightenment on a tree,
but you know,

1967
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:57,960
the tree that Christ attains a 
resurrection on is the tree of life.

1968
01:48:59,230 --> 01:49:02,410
And it's the tree that grows out of the 
place where Adam died.

1969
01:49:02,620 --> 01:49:03,900
So that's part of the,
this,

1970
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:08,110
the story that this association 
associated with Christian symbolism.

1971
01:49:08,710 --> 01:49:11,590
If you look at Greek Orthodox,
Russian Orthodox,

1972
01:49:11,591 --> 01:49:15,820
crucifixions,
the crucifix is always got Adam Skull at

1973
01:49:15,821 --> 01:49:17,680
the bottom.
So Adam dies.

1974
01:49:17,681 --> 01:49:21,790
And what Christ represents is the thing 
that transcends that death and that,

1975
01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:22,793
and this is very important.
I mean one of the ideas that's nested 

1976
01:49:25,841 --> 01:49:27,880
there,
and I think this is the prime idea,

1977
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:31,930
is that you can overcome death if you 
can accept it voluntarily,

1978
01:49:32,710 --> 01:49:35,950
if you can embrace it,
if you can see it as a necessary part of

1979
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:36,813
being,
if you can detach from it your 

1980
01:49:38,201 --> 01:49:40,750
presupposition that it's only evil and 
destructive.

1981
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:44,500
And so now that's a hypothesis,
right?

1982
01:49:44,530 --> 01:49:46,690
It's a hypothesis.
But

1983
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:51,830
you know,
because one of the things you got to ask

1984
01:49:51,831 --> 01:49:52,970
yourself,
for example,

1985
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:57,870
you can say that existence is 
meaninglessness,

1986
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,170
meaningless.
You know that,

1987
01:49:59,171 --> 01:50:02,640
that we're in a clockwork world in the 
Newtonian world,

1988
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:03,713
which we're clearly not.
But you could except the Newtonian 

1989
01:50:06,001 --> 01:50:06,834
worldview that we're in a mechanical 
universe and that things unfolded and 

1990
01:50:10,771 --> 01:50:14,100
mechanical and deterministic way that 
consciousness has empathy.

1991
01:50:14,101 --> 01:50:15,780
Phenomenal.
And then when you're done,

1992
01:50:15,781 --> 01:50:16,770
you're done.
And that's it.

1993
01:50:16,771 --> 01:50:17,604
And this is all a consequence of random,
of randomness laying itself out across 

1994
01:50:21,151 --> 01:50:22,710
time,
randomness and causality.

1995
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:27,000
That's one way of looking at it.
And there's powerful reasons for looking

1996
01:50:27,001 --> 01:50:28,950
at it that way.
But there are,

1997
01:50:28,980 --> 01:50:31,470
there are consequences to looking at it 
that way.

1998
01:50:31,471 --> 01:50:32,304
First of all,
we do not know that that's true and we 

1999
01:50:34,351 --> 01:50:36,510
certainly know that the world is not 
deterministic.

2000
01:50:36,750 --> 01:50:37,583
And we certainly understand that there 
were plenty of processes at play that 

2001
01:50:39,811 --> 01:50:43,470
are not random.
Sexual selection is not random.

2002
01:50:45,010 --> 01:50:47,680
So,
and sexual selection,

2003
01:50:47,681 --> 01:50:51,490
it's the reason we're,
the way they we are is because of sexual

2004
01:50:51,491 --> 01:50:52,324
selection.
So we've made conscious decisions the 

2005
01:50:54,641 --> 01:50:56,500
entire way about,
you know,

2006
01:50:56,590 --> 01:51:00,490
what elements of human forms should 
propagate themselves into the future.

2007
01:51:00,970 --> 01:51:01,480
Now,
Nino,

2008
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:06,280
nobody seems to take the metaphysical 
implications of that seriously.

2009
01:51:06,281 --> 01:51:08,500
And basically what happened,
Darwin was,

2010
01:51:08,770 --> 01:51:09,603
uh,
was extremely impressed by the power of 

2011
01:51:11,831 --> 01:51:12,664
sexual selection,
but because people couldn't handle the 

2012
01:51:15,251 --> 01:51:17,830
notion that evolution was shaped,
say,

2013
01:51:17,831 --> 01:51:18,664
in large part by female choice,
the biologist ignored sexual selection 

2014
01:51:22,241 --> 01:51:25,370
for 100 years after Darwin published,
uh,

2015
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:27,700
hip published his great work on 
evolution.

2016
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:31,390
It's only recently that people have been
able to take the sort of thing seriously

2017
01:51:31,391 --> 01:51:34,330
at all.
And we also don't understand epigenetics

2018
01:51:34,331 --> 01:51:35,580
at all.
You know,

2019
01:51:35,581 --> 01:51:36,414
over the epigenetics.
It's obvious that our own experiences 

2020
01:51:39,461 --> 01:51:40,294
can modify our genetic structure.
And the other thing that we don't 

2021
01:51:42,611 --> 01:51:44,160
understand,
there's,

2022
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:46,660
there's some animations and I'll send 
you guys the link to this,

2023
01:51:46,661 --> 01:51:49,000
but I saw some amazing animations in the
recent,

2024
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:52,540
in the last couple of weeks showing how 
DNA,

2025
01:51:52,710 --> 01:51:55,080
um,
um,

2026
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:58,870
separates and then reassembles during 
cell division.

2027
01:51:59,530 --> 01:52:00,363
And so they've,
they've modeled this at the molecular 

2028
01:52:02,621 --> 01:52:05,750
level using x Ray crystallography.
And so you could,

2029
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:08,740
it's unbelievable what's going on down 
at the ad level.

2030
01:52:08,770 --> 01:52:09,603
Basically what you see is there's these 
little machines that are made out of 

2031
01:52:12,251 --> 01:52:16,300
molecules,
like single molecules that have arms and

2032
01:52:16,301 --> 01:52:19,840
legs that walk around and move things 
and put things together.

2033
01:52:19,870 --> 01:52:23,350
Like you look at it down there,
you think that's computational.

2034
01:52:23,620 --> 01:52:24,453
Those bloody things are,
I think their quantum super computers 

2035
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:30,130
operating at that level.
Cause those goddamn things are smart.

2036
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:32,050
You know,
like there are these little machines,

2037
01:52:32,051 --> 01:52:32,884
they pull dna apart,
then they loop it around and cut it and 

2038
01:52:35,891 --> 01:52:36,724
they send the loops often at the same 
time as the DNA separates and it has to 

2039
01:52:39,971 --> 01:52:40,804
be remade.
These things are grabbing molecules as 

2040
01:52:42,791 --> 01:52:46,040
they come by,
like literally mechanically and sticking

2041
01:52:46,041 --> 01:52:49,700
them on the DNA chain and it's,
it's,

2042
01:52:49,730 --> 01:52:52,760
it's so computational that it's,
it's mind boggling.

2043
01:52:52,760 --> 01:52:54,770
I'll send you the links.
It's like I looked at that.

2044
01:52:54,771 --> 01:52:56,720
It just,
it just blew me away.

2045
01:52:57,140 --> 01:52:57,973
You know?
And we have no idea what kind of 

2046
01:52:59,030 --> 01:52:59,863
computational processes are available at
the micro scale that we do know that 

2047
01:53:03,141 --> 01:53:05,810
quantum computation as possible.
And you know,

2048
01:53:05,811 --> 01:53:09,200
that means that computation can be 
occurring in,

2049
01:53:09,290 --> 01:53:11,450
at,
in it with extreme power,

2050
01:53:11,451 --> 01:53:14,270
at levels of resolution.
We would have never imagined possible.

2051
01:53:14,510 --> 01:53:18,470
But I can tell you look at those bloody 
videos and you look at them with a fresh

2052
01:53:18,471 --> 01:53:19,304
mind.
The idea that what's happening down at 

2053
01:53:20,871 --> 01:53:25,220
the molecular level is it the idea that 
it's not intelligent is insane.

2054
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:28,010
I mean those bloody things or making 
decisions,

2055
01:53:28,220 --> 01:53:29,053
it's not deterministic.
It's way too complicated to be 

2056
01:53:31,071 --> 01:53:31,904
deterministic.
Looks more like a car factory or 

2057
01:53:34,251 --> 01:53:39,251
something like that.
It's incredible molecules,

2058
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:47,440
single molecules like sometimes a five 
or six Adams.

2059
01:53:48,830 --> 01:53:49,663
So there's like the one things that when
they're making the telomeres that pull 

2060
01:53:52,281 --> 01:53:55,940
the DNA apart,
they like whip out these telomeres which

2061
01:53:55,941 --> 01:54:00,020
are made out of four molecules.
They kind of make a square that extends,

2062
01:54:00,530 --> 01:54:03,590
there's little gadgets that are putting 
those together and then when they've got

2063
01:54:03,591 --> 01:54:07,280
them all done and they need to signal 
the fact that they were finished,

2064
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:10,130
these other little molecules that look 
like little stick man,

2065
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:11,383
they grab a molecule and they walked 
down the telomeres like one foot after 

2066
01:54:16,071 --> 01:54:19,310
another carrying this thing that's going
to be the message.

2067
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:21,560
It's it's,
I wish I could show it to you.

2068
01:54:21,561 --> 01:54:22,394
It's unbelievable.
It's like just make your jaw drop and 

2069
01:54:25,011 --> 01:54:25,844
it's intelligent.
There's no way that that's bierly 

2070
01:54:27,771 --> 01:54:28,604
deterministic nor a chance.
Plus those bloody things can fix 

2071
01:54:31,611 --> 01:54:32,444
mistakes in DNA.
So because your cells are repairing 

2072
01:54:35,761 --> 01:54:37,470
mistakes in Dna all the time,
it's like,

2073
01:54:37,471 --> 01:54:38,790
well how do they do that?
Well,

2074
01:54:38,791 --> 01:54:40,260
if you,
if you bought a limit,

2075
01:54:40,261 --> 01:54:42,330
looks like they look at it and look at 
it,

2076
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:43,193
whatever the hell that means,
they're evaluating it to see where 

2077
01:54:45,571 --> 01:54:47,850
there's a mistake.
So it's like,

2078
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:50,360
oh,
it's,

2079
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:53,240
it's like their little robots that are 
doing diagnostics.

2080
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:54,780
Diagnostics.
Yeah.

2081
01:54:55,410 --> 01:54:57,510
So it's,
it's all right.

2082
01:54:57,511 --> 01:54:58,261
So now,
okay,

2083
01:54:58,261 --> 01:55:00,420
so what happens after Adam and eve?
So,

2084
01:55:00,450 --> 01:55:01,283
Yup.

2085
01:55:03,530 --> 01:55:04,790
Yeah,
let's have a short break.

2086
01:55:04,791 --> 01:55:05,624
Okay.
Only let's do it for five minutes 

2087
01:55:06,591 --> 01:55:09,530
because I really want to finish this 
part before we end.

2088
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:14,240
So while you're gone,
I'll show you this.

2089
01:55:14,241 --> 01:55:15,074
I'll find this animation.
You guys can come up here and take a 

2090
01:55:16,761 --> 01:55:18,410
look at it cause it's mind boggling.
