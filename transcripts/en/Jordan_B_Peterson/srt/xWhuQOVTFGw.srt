1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,030
[inaudible].

2
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,743
All right,
well I'm talking today with Dr. James 

3
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,320
Lindsey,
Dr Peter Boghossian,

4
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,453
and Dr Helen pluck roads and they're all
famous or infamous depending on your 

5
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:34,604
perspective as the authors of a series 
of hoax articles that were published in 

6
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:40,603
what purport to be academic journals in 
the last year following up work done by 

7
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:48,140
socal back.
How long ago was that?

8
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,620
Now it's gotta be like 25 years now.
Right,

9
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,483
right.
So we've all assumed or you've all 

10
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:55,910
assumed that the situation hasn't 
improved.

11
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:56,744
So the first thing I'm going to do,
we're going to have an extended 

12
00:00:58,461 --> 00:00:59,294
discussion about these articles and 
about the motivation for producing them 

13
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,253
and then the necessity for that,
the morality of that at the aftermath 

14
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:07,724
and all of that in.
The first thing I'm going to do is have 

15
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:12,740
each of you introduce yourself and then 
we'll launch right into a discussion of,

16
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:18,650
let's call it the scandal.
Dr. Lindsey.

17
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,200
Yeah.
Good to be here.

18
00:01:21,201 --> 00:01:24,440
So I have a background in mathematics 
and physics.

19
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:25,274
My Phds in math.
I left academia in 2010 and had been 

20
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:30,060
studying,
uh,

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,080
mostly religious and moral philosophy 
and psychology since,

22
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,190
and then got wrapped up in this idea.
I kind of was the,

23
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:42,170
I guess,
epicenter of the project.

24
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:46,580
I did all the submissions and managed 
all the emails and all of that.

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,000
And then Peter and Ellen,
uh,

26
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,910
filled in all of my weaknesses.
And so we spent,

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,840
you know,
an 18,

28
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,980
about 18 months working on this a year,
really 10 months writing papers.

29
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,590
Then there was the getting ready to go 
public.

30
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,270
So,
um,

31
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,850
that's kind of who I am and how I got 
into this.

32
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:05,810
I just,
uh,

33
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:06,723
uh,
lapsed mathematician who gives a lot of 

34
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,533
concern to how we produce knowledge and 
what academic standards are and should 

35
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,870
be.
So what,

36
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,010
why did you leave academia?
I wish I could say that it was like this

37
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:22,844
Prussian thing.
I saw the writing on the wall that it 

38
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:25,334
was going mad and I wanted out,
but really it was just a number of 

39
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:28,724
personal responsibilities and 
commitments that led me to not want to 

40
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:32,950
pursue,
um,

41
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,250
employment where I didn't know where I 
would be placed from one post doc to the

42
00:02:37,251 --> 00:02:39,710
next.
It was family commitments primarily.

43
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,240
But you were still interested enough to 
continue with this project?

44
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,850
Interested enough in the academic world?
Yeah.

45
00:02:46,851 --> 00:02:47,840
I never really

46
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,740
need to stop researching or reading and 
thinking and coming up with new ideas.

47
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,653
Uh,
it's very difficult to do mathematics 

48
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:57,230
without some institutional backing.
Uh,

49
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,440
math is hard as some people have 
noticed.

50
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,633
So I didn't have the resources necessary
really to pursue mathematical research 

51
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,553
independently,
but I found that I could dig into 

52
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:12,490
philosophy and I could dig into a 
psychology kind of on my own,

53
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,530
not professionally of course,
but,

54
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,603
um,
that's enough to get an idea of what I 

55
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:17,734
was,
was looking at in a philosophical sense 

56
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,510
to answer questions that I was really 
deeply interested in.

57
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:27,511
Mostly the question that drove me 
probably from about 2011 forward was,

58
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,790
you know,
what do people really mean?

59
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,950
What are they talking about when they 
say the word God?

60
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,850
And so I really got involved in talking 
about they're thinking about religion.

61
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:38,860
That's what led me to religious and 
moral psychology,

62
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:41,000
trying to understand why people,
uh,

63
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,360
believe things that they do and why 
they,

64
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,210
why they manifest their beliefs in 
certain ways.

65
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,720
And ultimately because I was,
you know,

66
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:53,860
that kind of a guy,
I just wanted to find out what I figure.

67
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:57,070
I live in the southeast us,
so really religious area.

68
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,440
People talk to me about their belief in 
God all the time.

69
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,730
I hear it constantly at different levels
from the,

70
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,240
you know,
yeah,

71
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:05,750
there's,
I,

72
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,583
I kind of believe level all the way to 
the borderline insane level of 

73
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:16,090
conviction to very implausible 
propositions level.

74
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,223
And I wanted to understand,
I know the people talking about ideas 

75
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:23,140
like God means something when they saved
the term.

76
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,360
It's something very,
not just do they mean something.

77
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:27,070
They need something very important to 
themselves.

78
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,383
And I wanted to figure out from a 
perspective that didn't rely upon the 

79
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,064
religious,
the theology or the religious mythology 

80
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:35,704
or narrative,
what they were speaking to as articles 

81
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,030
within,
in the material world.

82
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,253
And so I became very interested in that 
and spent a number of years reading and 

83
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:44,344
writing about it.

84
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,670
And by the way,
the kind of culture war,

85
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:52,390
if you want to call it that progressed.
It's seeing what was happening to people

86
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:55,450
I was interested in.
I'm Sam Harris for example,

87
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:57,010
was,
was certainly one of these people.

88
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,060
You see these people get called racist 
or sexist for what seemed to be nothing.

89
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:04,540
And you try to dig into it again with 
the interest in meaning of words,

90
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,030
kept seeing these references back to 
these,

91
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:09,160
you know,
power dynamics and um,

92
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,383
sociological definitions that that only 
see racism or sexism is structural 

93
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:19,231
entities that allow basically people of 
people to be considered racist or sexist

94
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,070
just because of their identity by just 
by virtue of being,

95
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:24,940
say,
a white male,

96
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:28,120
you could be racist and sexist 
inevitably are.

97
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:29,730
That's exactly,
exactly.

98
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,880
So that's what led me to get curious 
about the grievance studies.

99
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:35,050
Can.
And ultimately,

100
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,630
Peter,
let's hear,

101
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,810
let's hear from you and tell everybody 
who you are and what you're up to.

102
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,663
I'm currently teaching philosophy at 
Portland State University in the 

103
00:05:45,381 --> 00:05:50,381
philosophy department and I am up to 
James Lindsey and I just finished a book

104
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,083
how to have impossible conversations 
that will come out probably in 2019 

105
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,860
decapo press

106
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,233
and I don't know what I'm up to now 
because I made be looking at a career 

107
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:05,960
change very soon.
So,

108
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,080
um,
we go get into that later.

109
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:11,240
But the university filed charges against
me.

110
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:15,090
They found me guilty of not seeking irb 
approval and that

111
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,930
investigation is ongoing for the 
falsifications.

112
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,740
We better have quite a conversation as 
well about IRB approval.

113
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:25,790
That's another rabbit hole we can punch 
down because that's another catastrophic

114
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,624
catastrophe that the University of has 
inflicted upon itself over the last two 

115
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,464
decades.
So that's something that's becoming 

116
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:35,870
increasingly politicized.
So it's very difficult to understand how

117
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:38,840
you could get irb approval for a satire

118
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,250
or why you might need it.
Okay.

119
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:42,970
Okay,
good.

120
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,590
Hello,
let's hear from you.

121
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,830
But I have a background in literature 
and early,

122
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,150
late medieval,
early modern studies.

123
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,540
I'm interested in how women use the 
Christian narrative to,

124
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,223
um,
to get all 30 and autonomy for 

125
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:10,330
themselves,
sort of 1300 to 1700 things.

126
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:14,560
So I'm looking at how this change before
and after the reformation,

127
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:18,130
how the narratives changed.
But I,

128
00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:20,950
um,
I left at the end of my masters.

129
00:07:20,951 --> 00:07:25,951
I was intending to go back and do my phd
in medieval manuscripts.

130
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,600
Um,
but it's just got,

131
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,153
I keep going earlier and earlier because
it is so difficult to get away from the 

132
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:34,450
ideology.
I'm,

133
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:38,080
I'm interested in medieval manuscripts,
but not overwhelmingly.

134
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:42,370
I want to look at social history,
but it's so difficult to do that because

135
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:43,204
there is a pressure now to do so 
anachronistically to read it through 

136
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,460
gender ideology of today.

137
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,293
So I have to accept that the reason I 
was going to do medieval manuscripts is 

138
00:07:52,991 --> 00:07:53,824
because I can translate and transcribe 
and this is something objective that I 

139
00:07:56,981 --> 00:07:57,814
can do.
I can produce an edition of texts which 

140
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:03,160
aren't readily available and explain 
them.

141
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,520
And that's the only real way that I'm 
able to look at religious writing by and

142
00:08:09,311 --> 00:08:13,660
about women,
men and the objective way.

143
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:17,860
And it isn't really I want to do.
So I stepped away for a year and in that

144
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,280
year I started writing about about 
postmodernism,

145
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:24,400
about feminism,
about liberalism and ideology.

146
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,900
And then it just got to be so much to do
with that.

147
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,633
But I,
I haven't gone back at all so involved 

148
00:08:33,461 --> 00:08:34,294
in,
in writing about what's going on right 

149
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,690
now.
And so that is,

150
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,890
I see,
well it's interesting because you,

151
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:42,724
you talked about

152
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,530
your,
your belief that women in the

153
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,500
mid stages of development of the 
Christian Church we're using,

154
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:53,660
the idea is to actually liberate 
themselves.

155
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:54,963
And too,
the examples from margery Kempe to 

156
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:01,014
Emilia Lania and we're looking at very 
different ways in which you know it 

157
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,590
within the Catholic narrative,
for example,

158
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:10,590
women would say,
well God speaks directly to me.

159
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,424
He is the patriarch.
It gives me a certain or sovereignty to 

160
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:20,541
disagree with a patriarchal if I'm with 
my husband.

161
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,283
And then later after the reformation,
there was a slightly different emphasis 

162
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:27,770
in which women,
you know,

163
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,720
everyone can interpret the Bible and 
that includes women.

164
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:34,320
So there was a different kind of 
authority there too.

165
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:35,154
So that,
that's generally been what I've been 

166
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,244
interested in,
slightly different ways that women have 

167
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:44,530
approached biblical texts,
biblical narratives and um,

168
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,211
and,
and yes,

169
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:46,044
and use them to,
to challenge sort of mainstream 

170
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,710
interpretations.
And um,

171
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,020
I make some,
make some pretty good arguments.

172
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:52,854
Well,
I mean the Alanya certainly did not 

173
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:55,630
recant,
mostly sweetened.

174
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,863
Okay.
So why don't we start by why are you 

175
00:10:02,021 --> 00:10:04,800
guys telling us what the genesis of this
project was?

176
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,673
Let's outline the project itself that 
the sequence of papers that you wrote 

177
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,920
and let's talk about the genesis of that
as well.

178
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:16,921
So take that one.
It's really kind of kind of interesting.

179
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,710
I don't know if your audience would know
this,

180
00:10:20,711 --> 00:10:23,200
Jordan or not,
but all three of us,

181
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:26,410
you know,
we're writing a bit within what might've

182
00:10:26,411 --> 00:10:29,830
been considered the new atheist vein and
working within that.

183
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,693
And then I was working on a book trying 
to answer my big kind of early 2010 his 

184
00:10:35,681 --> 00:10:38,380
research question,
what do people mean when they say,

185
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:39,214
God?
I was writing a book called that I 

186
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:41,950
eventually titled Everybody is wrong 
about God.

187
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,233
And I,
Peter called me one day while I was 

188
00:10:44,651 --> 00:10:47,530
working on either the book itself or the
research for it.

189
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,300
I don't recall the specifics at the 
time,

190
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,660
but he called me one day and said,
you know,

191
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,361
dude,
dude,

192
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,194
I think I'm going crazy.
I keep trying to tell people something 

193
00:10:55,361 --> 00:10:56,194
that's as obvious as can be to me.
And somebody has to believe I'm not 

194
00:11:00,251 --> 00:11:01,630
crazy.
Everybody thinks I'm nuts.

195
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,910
Please tell me I'm not crazy.
And so I said,

196
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:04,571
you know,
what is it?

197
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:06,360
And he said,
um,

198
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,743
I look at the way people in gender 
studies use their scholarly can and the 

199
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:15,130
way they produce that,
the way that they refer to it,

200
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,510
the fact that it seems disconnected,
uh,

201
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:22,630
in a literal sense from what's going on 
in reality.

202
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,003
And it feels like it's their Bible.
It feels like it's a holy scripture for 

203
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,880
something like a religion.
Am I going nuts?

204
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,120
And as it turned out,
the reason I started writing the book,

205
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,553
everybody's wrong about God,
was partly to answer my big research 

206
00:11:38,081 --> 00:11:38,914
question,
but it was also because I noticed that 

207
00:11:40,421 --> 00:11:43,420
the community built up around new 
atheist activism,

208
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,410
which called a Selfie.

209
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:49,410
Atheism community showed almost all of 
the symptoms of qualifying as a religion

210
00:11:50,981 --> 00:11:51,814
at least from like Durkheim's 
perspective and maybe even from some 

211
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:55,264
others.
So I immediately latched onto what Pete 

212
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:58,750
said and I said,
no,

213
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,790
you're not crazy.
I think you're probably right.

214
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,683
I think you are absolutely right that 
the scholarly Canon in gender studies 

215
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:09,751
and so on is operating like of book of 
faith for something.

216
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,123
But I don't know exactly what this is.
And so we got curious about that 

217
00:12:15,731 --> 00:12:18,160
scholarly cannon kind of from that 
point.

218
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,383
It wasn't long after that that the 
infamous feminist glaciology paper came 

219
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,160
out,
uh,

220
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,960
where the,
uh,

221
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:26,794
few four or five researchers published a
very well funded study showing or 

222
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:32,434
claiming to show that that glaciology is
inherently sexist all the way back to 

223
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:37,950
its roots.
Um,

224
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,120
back to,
you know,

225
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:44,320
the intrepid explorers of mountains and 
polar regions.

226
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,050
And all this.
So it is justified by being a big,

227
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:49,420
tough guy in the 19th century or 
whatever.

228
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,780
And that apparently somehow this 
masculinist bias hangs over.

229
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:55,984
And so the answer to this is to put 
feminist art projects as part of place 

230
00:12:58,691 --> 00:13:01,990
for science.
And it just apologies as part of glacier

231
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:06,260
science or else it's racist and sexist.
And I,

232
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,690
I mean I remember reading the paper 
lightly at the time and thinking there's

233
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:13,330
no way this is real.
And Peter and I had a phone call,

234
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,660
we started looking at new peer review on
the twitter at the same time.

235
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,980
Oh,
you should never look at that.

236
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,720
Oh my God.
So

237
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,620
we've,
we've actually got two issues here.

238
00:13:22,621 --> 00:13:25,420
Then let's say no all of a sudden 
because yeah,

239
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,740
there's a,
there's the,

240
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,470
there's the issue of what's going on in 
the

241
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,043
social justice oriented academic 
disciplines and then there's a deeper 

242
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:40,501
issue of how people view the world 
individually and collectively.

243
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,243
Yes.
Through the lens of a belief system and 

244
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:49,141
the probability that that belief system 
will take on something approximating the

245
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:53,110
trappings of a religious movement.
Yes.

246
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,560
So that's a deeper question.
I mean,

247
00:13:56,561 --> 00:14:00,580
one of the things that I discussed 
continually with Sam Harris when we have

248
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:01,414
our series of debates was the question 
of the inescapable realty of something 

249
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:07,414
approximating a religious framework to 
orient people in relationship to action 

250
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:12,340
in the world.
Cause I like,

251
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:14,890
I happen to believe that a framework 
like that is inescapable.

252
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,350
The question is not whether you're going
to have one,

253
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:20,570
it's which one you're going to have and 
what is it going to be rooted in.

254
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,560
And I mean,
one of the things I think that both meet

255
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:28,990
you and Dostoyevsky warn people about in
the late 19th century was that,

256
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,460
um,
what,

257
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,530
what,
this isn't a quote from either of them,

258
00:14:32,531 --> 00:14:36,280
but it's something approximating someone
else whose name I don't remember.

259
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,433
Um,
he who believes in nothing will end up 

260
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:42,940
believing in anything.
And there's something,

261
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,313
there's something in that that's 
extraordinarily deep as far as I'm 

262
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:46,601
concerned.
All right,

263
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:47,434
so you were interested in religious 
phenomenology and then you guys started 

264
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:51,250
to see that,
um,

265
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:52,070
as

266
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,640
far as you were concerned,
a variety of different causes.

267
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,660
I academic or academic movements were 
taking on the trappings of a religious,

268
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,393
they were starting to look religious in 
their approach and in their application 

269
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:10,940
of their beliefs right on the,
on the social justice end of it.

270
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,010
Right.
Community for example,

271
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:17,840
was definitely engaging in of course 
they had kind of their uh,

272
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:18,674
their unique vocabulary that they speak 
to one another end and identify one 

273
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:24,770
another by,
uh,

274
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,260
which is kind of like an ecclesiastical 
vocabulary,

275
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:32,261
but if social justice and then they were
definitely involved,

276
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,724
what,
what they call political correctness is 

277
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,810
in practice,
virtually identical to what you see with

278
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:39,890
people crying.
Blasphemy.

279
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,663
Um,
so these parallels started to stick out 

280
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,613
at the same time,
the way that we started looking at the 

281
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:51,290
real peer review twitter account and the
way that they seem to be producing their

282
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,350
knowledge that they could then refer to 
virtually replicates special revelation,

283
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,810
the,
they came up with their ideas,

284
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,580
they believe that they came from some 
morally backed source of,

285
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,220
uh,
of goodness and then put them forth.

286
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,113
And then were they were,
were morally vetted and given an 

287
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,760
epistemological status they didn't 
deserve.

288
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,670
As a result can,
why do you think the sources,

289
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:21,770
the sources at the time I had no idea,
but now after having done the project,

290
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:25,580
I think the source is actually what I've
come to call a postmodern mythology.

291
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,473
That our social reality is conditioned 
upon use of language and representation 

292
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:31,814
and it's all done in service to power 
dynamics that underlie how society 

293
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:36,404
works.
Those power dynamics are trapped up in 

294
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:42,260
identity and um,
mediated primarily through language in,

295
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:46,490
in media
identified the sources of that.

296
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,473
And not only me obviously,
but I've identified the sources of that 

297
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:53,330
beliefs with the French postmodernist 
movement.

298
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:54,164
Fundamentally,
other people trust some of it back 

299
00:16:55,881 --> 00:17:00,060
farther to what's essentially something 
approximating a Marxist doctrine,

300
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,950
which is the doctrine of which is the 
doctrine of power relations,

301
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,280
I would say.
Sure.

302
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,340
We'll have any criticisms or further 
comments on that.

303
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:12,240
Let's call it genealogy genealogy or 
Lynn or Helen.

304
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:13,970
Helen.
Helen.

305
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:14,804
Good.

306
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,261
Yeah,
no,

307
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:16,094
I,
I largely agree with the idea that we 

308
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:20,660
had,
uh,

309
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,493
uh,
quite a profound epistemic shift in the 

310
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,880
late sixties with the rise of the 
postmodernists.

311
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:31,330
I disagree with people who crying kind 
of relate this closely to Marxism.

312
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:35,290
I,
I think it's clear that they,

313
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:40,040
they have a common ancestor and that 
they have certain ideas in common.

314
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:45,070
But if we conflate Marxism and 
postmodernism too close to the,

315
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:48,020
on more than those yeah.
That,

316
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,410
that sort of oppressor and oppressed 
group,

317
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,590
that surge of them.
Um,

318
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,563
false consciousness,
these sort of key ideas which really 

319
00:17:55,721 --> 00:17:59,050
worth floating around at the same time 
and they've come up in the same place.

320
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,243
If we conflate those two closely and we 
are not looking at the really profound 

321
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:04,384
differences in epidemiology in which 
Marxism was really trying to continue 

322
00:18:09,071 --> 00:18:11,230
and modernist project,
it was totalitarian,

323
00:18:11,231 --> 00:18:13,090
it was objective,
this most of the,

324
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:16,330
and it went sort of in a straight line 
and the,

325
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,840
if there was a word for the extremes of 
Marxism,

326
00:18:19,841 --> 00:18:21,220
it,
this totalitarianism,

327
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,920
if there's a word for the extremes of 
postmodernism,

328
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:26,500
its disintegration.
It's fragmentation.

329
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,930
So we're looking now at something very 
different,

330
00:18:28,931 --> 00:18:32,350
something very intangible that is coming
in and,

331
00:18:32,351 --> 00:18:35,860
and it's saying we cannot access and 
objective truth.

332
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:36,694
Everything is created in discourses,
empowers us in systems of power and 

333
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:41,014
privilege.

334
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,360
Why in the world is power privilege?
Then like,

335
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,543
I mean it still seems that the 
postmodernists are willing to assume 

336
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,850
that the pursuit of power is,
first of all it's obvious,

337
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:54,684
but everyone's pursuing it.
But it's also okay for those who don't 

338
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:58,404
have it to pursue it.
So it's not as if they've abandoned the 

339
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:06,081
idea as far as I can tell of a,
of a linear narrative towards some end,

340
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,223
the end seems to me to be power.
And so why is that justifiable from the 

341
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:11,874
postmodern perspective given that linear
movement and Mehta narratives aren't 

342
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:17,004
justifiable

343
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,663
because of the change that happened in 
the late eighties so when socal for 

344
00:19:22,601 --> 00:19:23,350
example,
he,

345
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,183
he did his hopes.
What he was looking at was this collect 

346
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,543
sort of pure postmodernism.
This I'm very sort of intangible idea 

347
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,060
that an objective reality context is 
that we can't grasp anything,

348
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:34,894
that everything is a construct.
But what happened in the 80s gradually 

349
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:42,760
was that this just after prolific 
amounts of writing,

350
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:43,923
it just kind of fizzled because once you
disintegrated and dismantled absolutely 

351
00:19:47,441 --> 00:19:49,300
everything and it's all in a mess on the
floor,

352
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,463
you have got no where to go with this.
So we started seeing then the rising 

353
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,260
materialist feminism,
first of all,

354
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,153
um,
and then within sort of critical race 

355
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,173
approaches,
intersectionality in queer theory in 

356
00:20:02,981 --> 00:20:07,030
post-colonialism particularly,
we started seeing a change towards,

357
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,970
okay,
so everything is a cultural construct,

358
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,253
but we can't address anything if we 
don't accept that a certain group of 

359
00:20:14,471 --> 00:20:18,250
people in a certain place at a certain 
time experience certain things.

360
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,383
So what we're looking at now is an 
objective reality that oppression and 

361
00:20:22,631 --> 00:20:25,270
systems of power exist.
But

362
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,410
hmm,

363
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,620
everything else is socially constructed.
So the fundamental power,

364
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,490
but that construct has power.
Yes,

365
00:20:37,491 --> 00:20:38,324
it is objective.
It true that power is benefiting 

366
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:44,120
straight white men and disadvantages 
women of color,

367
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:45,620
trans women,
et Cetera.

368
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:48,280
So this,
this was the change that happened then.

369
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,400
So now it's politically actionable.
And this,

370
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:52,234
I mean,
it couldn't Kimberle crenshaw put this 

371
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:56,230
most explicitly when she said it's 
politics applied to postmodern theory.

372
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,503
Okay,
so we want to get this straight because 

373
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:01,980
it's very,
very important.

374
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:02,814
So you just,
you distinguish the postmodern movement 

375
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:09,150
from the Marxist movement because the 
Marxism Marxists,

376
00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:11,820
we're still moving in a single 
direction.

377
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:14,310
And you considered that still a part of 
the modernist project,

378
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,580
you acquainted Marxism and postmodernism
in so far as they both adult,

379
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,960
let's say an oppressor,
oppression,

380
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,100
oppression,
narrative.

381
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,150
Yes.
Although many other things do to,

382
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,640
and often that that's quite warranted.
I mean the,

383
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,010
the American revolution for example,
was an oppressor,

384
00:21:32,011 --> 00:21:34,630
oppressed revelations.
There was no doubt,

385
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,710
there's no doubt that power and power 
differentials exists.

386
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,603
The issue is not,
there are other realities that might be 

387
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:41,334
considered
truly yes wallet and whether it's 

388
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:50,850
reasonable to reduce everything to a 
single dimension of motivation.

389
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:51,684
So the postmodern project collapses into
its own nihilism and something emerges 

390
00:21:56,221 --> 00:21:57,054
out of the ashes.
And that's the assumption that a 

391
00:21:59,911 --> 00:22:00,744
transcendent reality does in fact exist,
but they only defining feature of that 

392
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:05,634
transcendent reality is the existence of
power in the existence of power 

393
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:13,041
differential.
And that's associated with identity.

394
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,440
But then then the question becomes,
there's,

395
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,250
there's a question that goes underneath 
that even,

396
00:22:17,251 --> 00:22:18,240
which is,
well,

397
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,133
why is it,
why is it that that is accepted as the 

398
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,620
fundamental reality?
Because there's no rationale for that.

399
00:22:25,621 --> 00:22:27,480
And postmodernism itself,
in fact,

400
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,440
auditors should criticize them.

401
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:31,850
Did they,
do they do it very much?

402
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:32,684
And then this is the argument that goes 
on repeatedly with the old style 

403
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:37,520
postmodernist saying this isn't 
postmodernism.

404
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,013
And so are we.
We've tended to call it applied 

405
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,730
postmodernism,
John Nurse to build it,

406
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:49,420
the poem wage cluster because it's just 
a set of ideas about identity,

407
00:22:49,551 --> 00:22:50,930
about power,
about privilege,

408
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:55,040
about language,
the importance of language and um,

409
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,443
and,
and hierarchies and things which have 

410
00:22:57,921 --> 00:23:00,980
come from postmodernism,
which have got politicized.

411
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:01,843
And then within activism have got 
condensed into kind of user friendly 

412
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:08,360
chunks and further bastardized.
So we can't,

413
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,570
we can't take this away from 
postmodernism.

414
00:23:11,571 --> 00:23:15,770
It didn't come from anywhere else.
But neither is it the,

415
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,043
the,
the pure sort of deconstructive or 

416
00:23:19,641 --> 00:23:20,474
poststructuralist or any of that at that
whole sort of massive range of theory 

417
00:23:24,891 --> 00:23:29,891
that that existed from the late sixties 
into the mid eighties that that died.

418
00:23:29,931 --> 00:23:30,920
It sits,
gone.

419
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,860
It's fragmented itself as it was always 
bound to do.

420
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:39,470
So to drive to your question about why 
or how they justified this change,

421
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,500
um,
I'll just say we called this,

422
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,400
this set of disciplines

423
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,590
or approaches,
grievance studies for a reason.

424
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,410
It's about grievances.
It's the politics of grievance.

425
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,573
So they feel aggrieved,
therefore they feel justified in trying 

426
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:56,714
to disrupt power.
They see that exists and declined power 

427
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:01,430
for themselves.
It's social revenge.

428
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,630
That's what they're,
that's what they're animus is.

429
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,840
That's their moral justification for,
for continuing to fragment and to chase.

430
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:15,150
The very thing they say is,
you know,

431
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,390
the great corruptor of man,
which has power.

432
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,370
Okay,
so it doesn't,

433
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,500
so it doesn't really matter if this is 
true,

434
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,440
and I do,
I have some sympathy with that claim.

435
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,873
It doesn't matter that there are 
philosophical incoherencies within the 

436
00:24:28,061 --> 00:24:28,894
structure,
within the intellectual structure at 

437
00:24:30,491 --> 00:24:31,324
all.
What matters is that there's an animus 

438
00:24:34,121 --> 00:24:34,954
and a motive,
and the motive is fundamentally 

439
00:24:36,071 --> 00:24:38,030
something approximating revenge.
Why?

440
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,430
Why would you say,
look,

441
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,550
why would you say revenge and not 
justice?

442
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:42,951
Like,
and,

443
00:24:42,951 --> 00:24:44,590
and this,
this goes to another issue,

444
00:24:44,591 --> 00:24:48,070
which is all the Asley,
all three of you oppose this movement.

445
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:49,933
And we've already decided in this 
discussion that it's something like the 

446
00:24:53,611 --> 00:24:57,690
revenge of the mar marginalized,
but the marginalized could well object.

447
00:24:57,691 --> 00:24:58,920
Well,
this isn't revenge.

448
00:24:58,921 --> 00:24:59,754
You only see it that way because you're 
part of the privileged power group and 

449
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:07,080
it's actually a search or a search for,
it's a search.

450
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,943
It's genuine search for justice,
social justice orientated that that's 

451
00:25:14,031 --> 00:25:14,880
what we have to remember.

452
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,170
This is speaking on behalf of women and 
racial and sexual minorities.

453
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,100
Most members of every group did,
do not ascribe to it.

454
00:25:23,101 --> 00:25:24,660
They're,
they're politically diverse.

455
00:25:24,661 --> 00:25:25,494
So it's,
um,

456
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,760
that's a good point.
That's a good point.

457
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:29,603
So that's one of the reasons that,
that the claim for the pursuit of 

458
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:36,480
justice is invalidated.
It's that there's no evidence whatsoever

459
00:25:36,481 --> 00:25:37,314
that the activist types who dominate 
these disciplines are valid 

460
00:25:39,841 --> 00:25:43,830
representatives of the communities that 
they purport to Stanford.

461
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:44,883
In fact,
if you surveyed the communities 

462
00:25:46,681 --> 00:25:51,390
themselves in any reasonable manner,
then the communities indicate their lack

463
00:25:51,391 --> 00:25:54,330
of agreement with,
with this way of looking at the world.

464
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,700
Yeah.
Yes,

465
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,550
of course.
There is also the,

466
00:25:58,551 --> 00:25:59,384
the,
the complicating element that nearly 

467
00:26:00,271 --> 00:26:01,104
always appears that you do have kernels 
of truth on both sides of that 

468
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:04,644
discussion.
There are legitimate questions of 

469
00:26:06,121 --> 00:26:07,800
justice that are being tied up into 
this.

470
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,143
And then there are legitimate reasons to
see it as being motivated primarily by 

471
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:14,124
something approximating revenge or 
grievance or reparations or something 

472
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:19,680
like that.
And they get intertwined.

473
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:20,514
And as you were mentioning with anytime 
you're working with postmodern 

474
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,590
epistemologies,
there's no reason to expect consistency.

475
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,130
They reject consistency as,
as,

476
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,260
as a bug in the system.
Uh,

477
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,020
they're unrepentant that unrepentant 
about being inconsistent.

478
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,910
That's no small point.
And,

479
00:26:36,911 --> 00:26:41,140
and I think when people watching that,
that point needs to be punched hole.

480
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,740
So Jim,
could you speak to a little about that?

481
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,091
Well,
yeah,

482
00:26:45,091 --> 00:26:47,550
it's um,
the,

483
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:50,460
the idea that you would be consistent is

484
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,830
one of the ideas that would be caught up
in the western philosophical tradition,

485
00:26:54,831 --> 00:26:55,664
as they would phrase it.
It's caught up in the exact tradition 

486
00:26:58,671 --> 00:26:59,504
that was bred of white and male power.
And so that needs to be disrupted 

487
00:27:04,311 --> 00:27:08,540
because that power inherently from the 
perspective of this Worldview,

488
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:09,374
that power inherently corrupt,
but more importantly in inherently 

489
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:15,440
always asked to preserve and maintain 
and legitimize itself.

490
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,573
So the demand for consistency becomes 
itself an act of oppression against 

491
00:27:20,961 --> 00:27:21,794
people.

492
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,450
Exactly.
That all seems reasonable to me.

493
00:27:24,451 --> 00:27:25,290
So,
so look,

494
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:26,124
so,
so here's a peculiar thing and it's an 

495
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:32,460
observation of something approximating,
let's say it's Friday,

496
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:33,294
a notion of projection.
The people who are pushing this 

497
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:40,770
viewpoint,
art,

498
00:27:40,771 --> 00:27:41,604
legitimate representatives of their 
communities in any real sense of the 

499
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:44,964
matter.
And they push a particular viewpoint 

500
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,070
that has very little academic 
credibility as far as I'm concerned.

501
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:50,904
And,
and is primarily concerned with 

502
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,703
political activism and with the 
obtaining or the justification of 

503
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,383
obtaining power.
Now we could assume that this is being 

504
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:03,720
done on behalf of the people who are 
putting forward the doctrine.

505
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,400
And so to me,
see,

506
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:09,090
I've come to understand that part of the
reason that people claim to their belief

507
00:28:09,091 --> 00:28:14,091
systems is because they have,
the reason they have the moral authority

508
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,033
to occupy the hierarchical position that
society has granted them is because 

509
00:28:21,061 --> 00:28:24,570
they're regarded as experts in a,
in a belief structure.

510
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,273
And if the year that their claim to that
expertise is questioned in their moral 

511
00:28:30,481 --> 00:28:31,314
justification for occupying their 
position is eradicate it and it's their 

512
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:36,714
position gives them purpose in life and 
that protects them from uncertainty and 

513
00:28:40,471 --> 00:28:42,720
anxiety.
It's not the belief structure itself.

514
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,554
You see it's for factor are experts in 
the belief system and that justifies 

515
00:28:47,371 --> 00:28:48,204
their position in the hierarchy.
So they put forward this claim to 

516
00:28:50,551 --> 00:28:55,200
continue justifying the fact that they 
occupied very perversely.

517
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:57,930
And this is the fruit of the projection 
is so very perversely,

518
00:28:57,931 --> 00:29:02,070
the very positions of power whose 
existence a credit sucks.

519
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,933
This would be a university professor 
types of protection that seems 

520
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,600
reasonable to you or,
or is there something wrong with that?

521
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,110
Oh,
the courts actually with what I've drawn

522
00:29:12,111 --> 00:29:15,810
from reading John Height for example,
who talks about psychosocial,

523
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:16,763
a psycho social evaluation and the way 
that human beings do that with one 

524
00:29:20,481 --> 00:29:21,314
another.
How we identify where we stand in our 

525
00:29:23,331 --> 00:29:25,360
social and moral hierarchies,
uh,

526
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,593
and how we,
where we position ourselves and others 

527
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:29,743
each other in relation to one another.
And that one of those three dimensions 

528
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:33,404
he named divinity.
And so that would be the part you're 

529
00:29:36,381 --> 00:29:37,730
speaking to.
So we gain,

530
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,260
we gained status in the hierarchy 
through our closeness of kin.

531
00:29:41,261 --> 00:29:42,094
So if you and I are friends,
you rank me higher than I probably 

532
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:45,304
deserve because that's how humans do.
And we gain status by reputation and 

533
00:29:48,731 --> 00:29:51,250
that's why we care what Michael Jordan 
thinks about politics.

534
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,010
And we gain status by,
um,

535
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,903
our moral standing,
which is what John Height called 

536
00:29:56,651 --> 00:29:57,484
divinity.
And of course he explored it primarily 

537
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:01,600
in the happiness hypothesis with regard 
to his trips,

538
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:02,434
I think the India and seeing a 
traditional religion and then comparing 

539
00:30:05,231 --> 00:30:10,210
that directly against the so called 
weird societies in Western democracies.

540
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,550
And,
uh,

541
00:30:11,551 --> 00:30:12,384
I think that what we're actually seeing 
in a lot of these cases as we're seeing 

542
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:19,110
partly at least people are acting out.
Um,

543
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,343
what,
what often gets conflated with religion 

544
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:22,294
in fact is that they're acting out the 
need to fulfill or participate in that 

545
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,150
third dimension of psychosocial 
evaluation.

546
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,240
Although in secular societies we throw 
out the,

547
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:38,230
the explicit religious structure for it 
and we have to find it in other ways.

548
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,910
So that's what you're actually talking 
about.

549
00:30:39,911 --> 00:30:41,310
They,
they occupy a Mo,

550
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,203
a moral expertise,
not more likes for TC gives them 

551
00:30:44,171 --> 00:30:47,770
standing within the prevailing moral and
Social Maloo.

552
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,873
And then that defines their place in the
community as in both in terms of 

553
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:53,440
prestige and in terms of hierarchy

554
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,443
standard.
They're basically acting out precisely 

555
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,630
what they're accusing all other 
disciplines of doing

556
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,590
control,
irony and the differences to see.

557
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,530
The thing is,
the difference as far as I'm concerned,

558
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:07,630
is that if you look at a discipline like
engineering,

559
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,950
which I think is perhaps as close to the
polar opposite of this,

560
00:31:10,951 --> 00:31:11,784
this might be managed.
One of the things that engineers do is 

561
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:15,603
look at the world in a certain way.
But another thing they do is build 

562
00:31:17,971 --> 00:31:20,000
bridges.
Exactly right.

563
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:24,010
That's right.
There's an objective real world,

564
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,320
uh,
direction to their,

565
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,543
to their philosophizing and their 
beliefs that results in something of 

566
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:31,204
tangible and university recognize 
benefit to the community at March and 

567
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,670
something that can fail.
Yes.

568
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:38,201
Right,
right,

569
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:38,860
right.
Also,

570
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,030
that's very important.
Okay.

571
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,960
Now,
okay,

572
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:44,260
next issue.
So now the first issue,

573
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,493
first of the next two issues saying is 
why is it that you three found herself 

574
00:31:50,231 --> 00:31:55,000
in a position where you decided to take 
this on as a critical project and why is

575
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:58,000
it that so few other academics are doing
so

576
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:04,060
I don't have good answers for why so few
academics are doing so.

577
00:32:04,061 --> 00:32:07,360
Cause I don't want to just blatantly 
call people cowards that I don't know.

578
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:10,470
But you don't get treated well for 
fighting.

579
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,460
Let's dig into that a bit.
Okay.

580
00:32:12,461 --> 00:32:15,820
Because I think,
I think cowardice is one or fear.

581
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,120
And let's,
let's start here.

582
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,423
Let's call it fear.
And let's also note that the fear is 

583
00:32:20,411 --> 00:32:21,970
well justified,
very justice.

584
00:32:21,971 --> 00:32:23,410
Yeah,
that's correct.

585
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,251
Right.
Well Peter,

586
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:25,084
you're in a great position to speak to 
that because look what's happening to 

587
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:27,904
you.

588
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,003
Yeah.
So I don't know if you want to go down 

589
00:32:30,911 --> 00:32:32,890
the path and what's happened to me yet,
but I,

590
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,530
I think you're right.
Our mutual friend,

591
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,423
Bret Weinstein said to me that academia 
where we had a conversation about 

592
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:40,544
academia self selecting for cowardice,
and I think it's a process that people 

593
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:47,690
go through it before they have tenure,
where they're afraid to buck the system,

594
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:48,524
afraid to challenge ideas.
They're afraid to question because who 

595
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:54,170
they won't get tenure and then once they
do get tenure,

596
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:55,920
then they won't make you a bit more 
climate.

597
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,773
Yeah.

598
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,873
That's the same thing happens in 
corporations at the middle manager 

599
00:33:00,131 --> 00:33:00,964
level.
Like it's not a disease that's endemic 

600
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,640
to academia.

601
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,900
No,
no it's not.

602
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:05,734
But it's one variable in a suite of 
variables that we have to take a look 

603
00:33:08,501 --> 00:33:09,334
at.
The other one is the culture in which 

604
00:33:10,511 --> 00:33:11,344
the cultural milieu that Jim spoke about
in which people are terrified to be 

605
00:33:15,281 --> 00:33:16,720
called sexist,
racist,

606
00:33:16,721 --> 00:33:18,910
bigot.
So they don't challenge those.

607
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,030
I'm even hesitant to say the things that
don't challenge,

608
00:33:22,031 --> 00:33:26,380
but I'll say it like race and Iq or 
trans issues,

609
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,690
trans bathroom issues.
If you teach an ethics class,

610
00:33:28,691 --> 00:33:32,500
people won't really dig into those 
issues in a substantive way.

611
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,580
But I think that there are many factors,
but not just one,

612
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,653
but it's just showing that people will 
come up to Jim and myself and I haven't 

613
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,850
spoken explicitly to Helen about this 
and they'll thank me.

614
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:43,640
Yup.
Oh,

615
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,860
thank you so much.
Oh,

616
00:33:44,861 --> 00:33:46,250
great.
Can you do that publicly?

617
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,093
No,
no,

618
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:47,591
no,
no,

619
00:33:47,591 --> 00:33:48,180
no,
no.

620
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,013
The same thing happened to me.
I think we should talk about what's 

621
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:55,060
happening to you because we talk about 
fear.

622
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,433
We can talk about cowardice,
we can talk about justifiable cause 

623
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,643
there's no,
there's no pleasure in being isolated 

624
00:34:01,601 --> 00:34:04,870
and moms and undermine and fired.
Right.

625
00:34:04,871 --> 00:34:08,320
So the apprehension of that is not 
merely coward,

626
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:08,661
it's,
it's,

627
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:09,760
it's,
it's realistic.

628
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,900
And I'm not underestimating the 
potential role,

629
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,120
the additional role of cowardice.
But then there's another issue too here.

630
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,440
And I'd be thinking about,
it's like,

631
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,933
to me,
many of these postmodern activist 

632
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:22,144
propositions are so fundamentally absurd
and so academically weak that most 

633
00:34:27,581 --> 00:34:32,470
serious social scientists and pretty 
much all serious stem types,

634
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:35,050
the stem researchers have just ignored 
them.

635
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:40,760
They thought they were beneath contempt.
And right

636
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,810
seriously mean that because I look at an
idea,

637
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,793
you know,
a brilliant postmodern activist idea 

638
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:50,434
like intersectionality where like 
patriarchy theory or like white 

639
00:34:52,511 --> 00:34:53,344
privilege,
all you have to do is spend an hour 

640
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:56,194
thinking through those things critically
and you realize that there's out 

641
00:34:58,331 --> 00:35:01,930
solutely nothing whatsoever to the 
methodologically or conceptually

642
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,010
as jen was saying,
you know,

643
00:35:05,011 --> 00:35:05,844
that they're,
there can be a kernel of Chris in 

644
00:35:08,431 --> 00:35:10,680
things,
but when they are theoretically built,

645
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,770
I mean obviously there,
there,

646
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:14,643
there,
there are societies in which white 

647
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:19,170
people are regarded more positively on 
average.

648
00:35:19,171 --> 00:35:21,930
But this is something that can be 
measured in three,

649
00:35:21,931 --> 00:35:23,790
which can be looked at,
which can be talked about.

650
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:24,624
And we don't actually have that way.
We have imaginary knapsacks and talk of 

651
00:35:28,891 --> 00:35:32,520
complicity.
And I'm an epistemological,

652
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,393
um,
environments in which white people 

653
00:35:34,681 --> 00:35:36,360
literally can't understand what's going 
on.

654
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,200
So we,
it,

655
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,280
we get a big mess

656
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,780
and it's,
it's,

657
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,693
there's a kernel of truth in that.
And so that gives them the opportunity 

658
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:45,780
to kind of retreat to this sensible 
space where they'll say,

659
00:35:45,781 --> 00:35:48,520
but there is racism and that there is 
sexism.

660
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:48,811
Well,
yes,

661
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:49,644
of course there is.
But what you're doing here with these 

662
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:52,464
theoretical concepts is,
is not looking realistically and 

663
00:35:56,161 --> 00:36:01,130
reasonably at that
adoption.

664
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,220
Right?
It's like,

665
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:03,054
okay,
well racism is a problem in sexism is a 

666
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:05,364
problem we'll say.
And any form of discrimination that 

667
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:13,020
isn't associated with the hypothetical 
outcome of the project is a problem.

668
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,970
But there are methods that everyone 
who's a decent social scientist knows to

669
00:36:17,971 --> 00:36:18,804
measure those and to estimate the 
proportion of the variance in the 

670
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,440
outcome problem that those issues are 
accounting for.

671
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,410
And the postmodern and activist types to
absolutely none of that.

672
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,200
Yeah.
I mean why would they?

673
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:37,730
Because they don't care about their 
agenda driven in their truth oriented.

674
00:36:37,731 --> 00:36:41,150
So there's going to be no point to even 
think like that.

675
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,520
Well,
they also can't,

676
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,700
they don't have the methods training.
Exactly.

677
00:36:45,701 --> 00:36:48,400
So,
so that also provides additional impetus

678
00:36:48,401 --> 00:36:49,234
for being motivated to criticize those 
that do because it's a lot easier than 

679
00:36:51,941 --> 00:36:52,774
say,
seeing the reality and the consequences 

680
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:58,270
of your own ignorance.
Let's talk about what's happening to you

681
00:36:58,271 --> 00:36:59,104
because I want to know about the cost 
that you're buried for this and then 

682
00:37:01,031 --> 00:37:03,760
we'll go back to why you guys decided to
do what you did.

683
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,760
So psu,
like many college campuses has become an

684
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:09,594
ideological community and I've 
demonstrated that I don't fit that mold 

685
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:16,620
and I suspect that they're going to go 
to great lengths to get rid of me.

686
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:21,510
So what's happened is I've been found 
guilty of Nazi he and Irb approval.

687
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,760
And

688
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,670
can you tell the viewers what that means
and provide some background detail.

689
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,460
Okay.
Okay.

690
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,563
So our be approval is there's a,
it's to call the IRB Institutional 

691
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,170
Review Board.
And whenever you do a,

692
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,730
an experiment on human subjects,
human beings or animals,

693
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:43,923
by the way,
you need to go through the irb and you 

694
00:37:46,121 --> 00:37:46,954
need to get permission and you detail 
exactly what it is that you're going to 

695
00:37:49,631 --> 00:37:51,190
do.
And they say to you,

696
00:37:51,191 --> 00:37:52,720
well,
you have to change this.

697
00:37:52,721 --> 00:37:54,190
You have to do this,
don't do this,

698
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,320
etc. And then they give you permission.

699
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,200
Okay.
These systems,

700
00:37:58,201 --> 00:37:59,034
just a little more background,
these systems were originally set up 

701
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:01,554
fundamentally to monitor relatively or 
potentially dangerous medical 

702
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:06,564
experimentation,
but they've expanded their per view so 

703
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:09,804
that now it's impossible for anybody 
who's an academic in any institution to 

704
00:38:13,411 --> 00:38:14,244
even interview people without seeking 
permission from a very vast and rigid 

705
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,710
bureaucratic structure that's easily 
politicized.

706
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:24,560
Yeah.
They came out of,

707
00:38:24,561 --> 00:38:28,010
and they do exist for good reasons.
The Nuremberg trials may lay,

708
00:38:28,011 --> 00:38:28,731
et Cetera,
et cetera.

709
00:38:28,731 --> 00:38:32,180
And people were in that envelope has,
has,

710
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,163
uh,
the number of experiments or the number 

711
00:38:34,671 --> 00:38:35,504
of things are calling,
are under that umbrella continues to 

712
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:38,344
increase.
We can talk about the ethics of the RV 

713
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,193
more generally,
but in our case are particularly mind 

714
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:48,180
that the IRB has no,
Jim and James and Helen don't fall under

715
00:38:48,231 --> 00:38:51,580
the off season pses rv so they can't be 
sanctioned.

716
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,240
I however,
allegedly can can be sanctioned,

717
00:38:55,241 --> 00:38:58,570
so I'd been found guilty on that first 
charge,

718
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,833
which,

719
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,490
well now look,
let's,

720
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,120
let's tell everybody what is published.
A sequence of papers,

721
00:39:05,121 --> 00:39:07,130
how many papers in journals is it?

722
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:12,000
We wrote 27 of them were accepted and 
four were published

723
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,900
on the cusp of publication,
for example.

724
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,350
Okay,
let's get it straight here.

725
00:39:19,351 --> 00:39:24,180
These are satirical publications that 
were published in hypothetically serious

726
00:39:24,181 --> 00:39:25,014
academic journals and now Peter,
you're being gone after for not seeking 

727
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:33,740
institutional review board permission to
publish studies that didn't exist.

728
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:35,080
Yeah,
two,

729
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,913
two things.
That's the first thing I'd been found 

730
00:39:37,181 --> 00:39:38,014
guilty of that and it's escalated to the
provost and the president of the 

731
00:39:41,591 --> 00:39:42,424
university and I believe that the 
provost is a former gender studies 

732
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:49,510
scholar and I'll just,
I'll let that sit there.

733
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:50,950
I do,
I do.

734
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:54,340
I can't pronounce the president's name 
to be blunt with you.

735
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,730
And the provost is new provost.
I'm not avoiding the question.

736
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:58,490
I just don't,

737
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,323
that's fine.
We can always put that in the 

738
00:40:00,061 --> 00:40:03,930
description of the video.
So what are you guilty of exactly?

739
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:04,764
Because these studies didn't exist.
You didn't undertake research on any 

740
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:08,844
human subjects.

741
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,733
They've decided that the journal editors
and peer reviewers are the human 

742
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:17,410
subjects that we were studying.
So not the studies themselves,

743
00:40:17,411 --> 00:40:22,411
but go up one level of Metta to the fact
that we were studying the culture of um,

744
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,790
Journal,
Journal Review and publication.

745
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,863
So the editors who are not anonymous and
then the anonymous peer reviewers are 

746
00:40:31,771 --> 00:40:33,720
considered to be the human subjects of 
our,

747
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,420
that's supposed to be,
I suppose.

748
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,430
I see.
So that's supposed to be distinguishable

749
00:40:37,431 --> 00:40:38,264
from you thinking and writing about the 
things that you encounter in your own 

750
00:40:40,851 --> 00:40:41,810
life,
for example,

751
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:45,080
which is also what now it's supposed to 
be subject to irb approval.

752
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,610
So,
so,

753
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,713
okay.
So there's a lot of moving parts to 

754
00:40:50,601 --> 00:40:51,850
this.
So we need to break it down.

755
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,340
I wonder,
I want to continue with the,

756
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,660
excuse me,
guilty of not seeking irb approval.

757
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:03,160
That can include turn up to termination 
from my current position.

758
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:04,923
And uh,
I just want to speak to that before I 

759
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:11,860
talk about the data fabrication charges.
So I don't agree with the decision,

760
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,813
but I definitely understand the 
pressures that they have on them to do 

761
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:18,370
something.
Who knows what's happening.

762
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:19,743
Pressures from a hope.
These activist types are a very tiny 

763
00:41:22,361 --> 00:41:24,360
proportion of the population.
So,

764
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,920
and when we're talking about pressure,
what exactly do we mean?

765
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,773
Well,
there was an anonymous hid piece by 12 

766
00:41:30,851 --> 00:41:33,690
or 11 of my colleagues published in the 
student newspaper,

767
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:38,930
the Portland Vanguard,
and they may be a small representation.

768
00:41:39,021 --> 00:41:41,540
I,
it's unclear to me in academia,

769
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,980
I don't think there are a small 
proportion of the pie.

770
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,373
They are a large and I think that they 
wield institutionalized power and have 

771
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:53,060
weaponized things like title line 
against people they don't like.

772
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,250
Um,
so there's that.

773
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,103
But I do want to say,
I don't really know what's happening 

774
00:41:58,761 --> 00:41:59,570
behind the scenes.
I,

775
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:03,710
my guess is these,
this group is extraordinarily vocal,

776
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,053
but what they're faced with now is a 
decision for what kind of university 

777
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:08,144
they want to be.
Is it one that uses power to support 

778
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:10,904
freedom of inquiry and pursuit of the 
truth or do they want to protect social 

779
00:42:13,851 --> 00:42:14,684
justice at all costs?
And the fabrication of data thing is 

780
00:42:18,351 --> 00:42:23,060
interesting because that's an ongoing,
it's currently ongoing investigation.

781
00:42:23,061 --> 00:42:24,320
And again,
those are very,

782
00:42:24,321 --> 00:42:25,370
very serious charges.

783
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,720
Let's look at it here too.
There was a very big difference.

784
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:34,970
Let's get this very clear between a self
admitted satire,

785
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,020
which had historical precedent and which
has ethical justification,

786
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:39,854
even if you don't agree with the 
justification data fabrication data 

787
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,144
fabrication occurs when you put Devin 
and you claim that it's truthful 

788
00:42:47,421 --> 00:42:50,720
representation of a real world 
situation.

789
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,233
Yeah.
Obviously that's distinct from satire 

790
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:56,280
and comedy.
Everyone understands that distinction.

791
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,360
Well,
the guy,

792
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,193
the idea is that those rules were put in
there for very good reasons and that is 

793
00:43:04,231 --> 00:43:06,750
people wouldn't use that to advance 
their careers,

794
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,870
which,
uh,

795
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:11,040
and they wanted to hide the results so 
they don't,

796
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:11,874
didn't want anybody to see what it was.
So the problem with that is that it 

797
00:43:15,361 --> 00:43:16,470
would,
as socal wrote,

798
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:19,340
that it would contaminate the,
uh,

799
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,193
research lines in perpetuity.
So what the success of our project 

800
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,234
dependent upon it being revealed so that
no longer applies and the idea that we 

801
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,330
would somehow,
not only am I not benefited from this,

802
00:43:33,331 --> 00:43:35,520
but this is coming a tremendous cost to 
me.

803
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,800
So
it's,

804
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,450
in my opinion,
it is,

805
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,413
uh,
a grow task abuse of what it means to 

806
00:43:44,771 --> 00:43:47,110
fabricate data.
And,

807
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,150
uh,
I mean it means be interesting to see.

808
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,013
It'll be interesting to see what happens
and be in as you see when it goes to 

809
00:43:51,641 --> 00:43:52,210
court.

810
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:52,830
Okay.
And so,

811
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:53,663
so yeah,
tell me about the proceedings when it 

812
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:59,470
goes to court.
What kind of card is it going to?

813
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,020
I don't know.
I mean,

814
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:04,570
first let me even take a step back from 
there.

815
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:08,500
So if you look at the timeline of events
when this occurred,

816
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,480
and I don't have that off the top of my 
head,

817
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,680
but,
uh,

818
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:12,860
the,
the,

819
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,490
the,
when I was falling guilty from the Irb,

820
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,090
it's been a series of,
uh,

821
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,060
of Nazi need,
irb approval.

822
00:44:19,061 --> 00:44:24,010
There was a series of a time when the 
university president could just end this

823
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,170
just like that.
You can say,

824
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,760
well,
we're going to put a,

825
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,820
a letter of reprimand in Europe.
Uh,

826
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:36,060
we're going to
make it and it will

827
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:42,300
guilty of who found you guilty.
That was the IRB was December 14th.

828
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,753
I see.
So the IRB is policing its own it's own 

829
00:44:48,491 --> 00:44:50,260
policies here.
Yeah.

830
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:55,150
So that was for the irb charge,
the open data falsification charges open

831
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:56,660
and still being investigated.
Uh,

832
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:00,160
and that actually started I think like 
two or three days after we went public.

833
00:45:00,161 --> 00:45:02,290
He got an email and said,
you've been summoned to a meeting.

834
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,260
And we were all in Portland together at 
the time in October.

835
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,293
The IRB,
which purports to be an ethics 

836
00:45:07,751 --> 00:45:09,760
committee,
doesn't have any problem with the ethics

837
00:45:09,761 --> 00:45:10,594
of policing themselves.
You might want to point that out very 

838
00:45:16,001 --> 00:45:16,834
strongly because they're not in a 
position to be policing accordance with 

839
00:45:19,751 --> 00:45:22,450
their own policies.
Conflict of interest.

840
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,140
Clearly there's something appalling 
about that.

841
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,013
And it's not surprising because there's 
plenty of hauling about the 

842
00:45:27,581 --> 00:45:28,810
institutional review boards.

843
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:34,620
Guilty,
guilty.

844
00:45:34,621 --> 00:45:36,630
It's been escalated to the president.
And again,

845
00:45:36,631 --> 00:45:40,110
the president could just decide just 
like that,

846
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:40,963
you know,
we're just going to put a letter in his 

847
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:43,560
file of reprimand and we're going to 
move on.

848
00:45:43,561 --> 00:45:45,630
And I think that the whole problem would
be,

849
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,550
uh,
ended,

850
00:45:47,551 --> 00:45:51,990
except my guess is that there are a lot 
of people crying for vengeance right now

851
00:45:51,991 --> 00:45:52,824
against me.

852
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:53,883
Right?
So they want to hang you out to dry as 

853
00:45:54,981 --> 00:45:55,814
an object lesson to people who would 
dare to do the things that you three 

854
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,050
have done.

855
00:45:59,050 --> 00:45:59,883
Because I'm a heretic and I'm a blast 
femur and I have attack their cannons 

856
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,180
and there has to be some price that's 
paid for this.

857
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,780
That's my guests when they're thinking.
And then the fabrication of data charge,

858
00:46:10,781 --> 00:46:11,614
again,
that's a very serious charge of okay 

859
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:18,220
data and those rules are put in,
put in place for a reason.

860
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:19,653
I don't think a court would find,
I mean it would be interesting to see 

861
00:46:23,621 --> 00:46:25,690
when this goes to quarter or if it does 
even go to court.

862
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,333
The idea that this was fabricated either
for personal gain or that would have to 

863
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:32,254
not be revealed at some time and that 
the future lines of literature would be 

864
00:46:35,951 --> 00:46:37,780
contaminated and polluted.
It's just,

865
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,110
it's just not true and I think that,

866
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,340
well also a clear,
it's a career ended in charge,

867
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:46,230
so that's partly why it's being brought 
against you,

868
00:46:46,231 --> 00:46:47,400
right?
Data fabrication,

869
00:46:47,401 --> 00:46:48,810
there isn't anything,
well,

870
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,050
there isn't any same thing worse within 
the domain of science,

871
00:46:52,051 --> 00:46:53,550
then you can do that.
You can do that.

872
00:46:53,551 --> 00:46:54,384
That
that's really unfortunate and 

873
00:46:57,001 --> 00:46:57,834
preposterous because the data 
fabrication occurred intentionally in 

874
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:04,080
the sense that we wanted to find out if 
they could detect,

875
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:05,183
because we suspected from the very 
beginning as we were kind of discussing 

876
00:47:07,801 --> 00:47:08,634
earlier,
that these people who largely work in 

877
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,480
the humanities are not equipped to do 
social science,

878
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,700
but that's ultimately what they're 
basically doing.

879
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:15,953
And so we wanted to see if they could 
detect utterly ridiculous data or data 

880
00:47:20,221 --> 00:47:23,940
that were clearly cherry picked or data 
or conclusions I should say,

881
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:25,740
that were drawn from data that aren't 
warranted.

882
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,920
And so we wrote papers that included,
in this case,

883
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:31,450
for example,
a dog park paper,

884
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:34,540
just transparently ridiculous data.

885
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:36,430
And in fact,
the first draft of that paper,

886
00:47:36,431 --> 00:47:37,264
even we knew the data were so bad that 
they were probably going to ask to see 

887
00:47:40,421 --> 00:47:42,910
it.
We thought that's the end of the road,

888
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:47,440
the papers then.
So we'll talk about the dog park paper.

889
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:49,840
Why don't you go through the papers that
have been published just briefly

890
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:57,520
and tell us why they're transparently 
ridiculous because that's also tension,

891
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:00,300
right?
Yeah.

892
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,050
Yeah.
The dog park paper,

893
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:02,903
um,
was the first one we had accepted in 

894
00:48:05,471 --> 00:48:09,770
February.
And it chronicles a,

895
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,673
it's a feminist scholar putatively 
that's chronicling dog rape culture by 

896
00:48:14,861 --> 00:48:17,560
examining dog humping in Portland dog 
parks.

897
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,210
And,
uh,

898
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,463
then draws conclusions from that using 
black feminist criminology as a tool to 

899
00:48:25,661 --> 00:48:26,494
conclude that it would be appropriate to
train men as we train dogs if only it 

900
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,784
were politically feasible.
So we have to come up with a 

901
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:32,960
metaphorical equivalent.

902
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:38,340
And that concludes that oppression of 
dogs based on perceived gender is real.

903
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:43,690
And the reason that that was allegedly 
concluded was we claimed that,

904
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:46,090
um,
humans intervened in,

905
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:50,950
broke up a gay dog rate much more 
frequently in vigorously,

906
00:48:50,951 --> 00:48:55,300
then they broke up straight dog rate.
And the paper,

907
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:59,230
I mean it's already a bit weird about 
these things.

908
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,080
The paper,
the paper included,

909
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:02,943
for instance,
the detail that the scholar sat in the 

910
00:49:05,711 --> 00:49:08,920
dog park for a thousand hours over the 
course of a year,

911
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:12,730
but never in the heavy rain and 
observed,

912
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:13,863
uh,
and then examined personally closely 

913
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:19,480
examined the genitals of just short of 
10,000 dogs,

914
00:49:19,481 --> 00:49:23,140
which if you've been to a dog park,
you've probably realized the same people

915
00:49:23,141 --> 00:49:25,660
bring their dogs almost every day.
It's,

916
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:28,660
there's not 10,000 dogs in any dog park 
in a year,

917
00:49:28,661 --> 00:49:33,661
but never mind to develop a reputation 
for looking at dogs genitals.

918
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:35,231
Yeah,
I think so.

919
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:38,140
And then immediately turning to ask 
their owners,

920
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:38,993
excuse me sir,
could you tell me your sexual 

921
00:49:40,121 --> 00:49:42,640
orientation?
Because that's what the paper says.

922
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:45,400
Wait,
10,000 dogs,

923
00:49:45,401 --> 00:49:46,234
Jen Genitals,
a 10,000 dogs and then interrogated 

924
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:50,550
their owners as to their sexual 
orientations.

925
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,013
It includes details that are irrelevant,
like weather dogs use the bathroom and 

926
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:59,830
the other dogs are in the food bowl.
The water bowl,

927
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,540
it talks about,
you know,

928
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:03,790
the way people would break up dog 
fights,

929
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:04,624
like doing jumping jacks and singing.
We thought this data was so absurd that 

930
00:50:08,591 --> 00:50:09,424
we put in the first draft,
which the journal saw align that said 

931
00:50:12,731 --> 00:50:13,564
that we took the data and put it in a 
recycle bin so that they couldn't 

932
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:19,270
possibly ask us to produce it because we
thought,

933
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,740
oh man,
if they asked for this data,

934
00:50:20,741 --> 00:50:22,420
which is so stupid,
it's over.

935
00:50:22,421 --> 00:50:25,690
So we said that we recycled the data,
which has already its own research,

936
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:28,130
ms practice and no problem.

937
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:30,390
Write it up.
Okay.

938
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,570
I can't believe we're having this 
conversation

939
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:36,110
and listen,
the more we talk about this,

940
00:50:36,111 --> 00:50:37,830
the more ridiculous it gets.
Okay,

941
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,220
so let's go on to another paper that's 
just on unbearable.

942
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:48,370
But there was the paper where we argued 
that if straight white straight man,

943
00:50:48,741 --> 00:50:50,510
I'm sorry,
it doesn't matter what their racist,

944
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,930
if straight men were to ainslie 
penetrate themselves with sex toys,

945
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:56,000
they'd become less transphobic and more 
feminist.

946
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:58,123
Um,
which apparently got picked up the 

947
00:50:59,671 --> 00:51:00,504
slack.
They may not want to have that 

948
00:51:01,941 --> 00:51:04,440
conversation,
but this data was this,

949
00:51:04,441 --> 00:51:07,940
this conclusion,
which was called a truly marvelous paper

950
00:51:07,941 --> 00:51:11,210
and an important contribution to 
knowledge by one of its reviewers.

951
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,160
Uh,
this paper was published,

952
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:17,990
this paper was based on interviews with 
13 men,

953
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,273
only eight of whom were straight.
And of course it was all interview data 

954
00:51:23,931 --> 00:51:28,850
and it was just people saying the most 
ridiculous things about their experience

955
00:51:28,851 --> 00:51:29,684
of sticking things in their own butts 
and then their feelings about feminism 

956
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:37,660
and a concern for rape culture and their
attitudes about trans people and so on,

957
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:40,543
including one so-called social 
conservative who was quoted saying he 

958
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:44,324
didn't want to take part in some stupid 
liberal study about sticking things up 

959
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:48,140
as,
but I mean,

960
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,120
it's almost impossible to have looked at
this and not thought,

961
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,040
you know,
something's going on here.

962
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:59,110
But instead they thought,
truly marvelous paper knowledge.

963
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:01,610
It's that,
that's a second paper.

964
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,340
A third paper,
um,

965
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,633
was an ethnography allegedly of a 70 
some odd year old man who went to 

966
00:52:08,421 --> 00:52:09,254
hooters with his Brazilian Jujitsu class
after workouts and sat there and 

967
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:14,354
basically just womanized for hours upon 
hours recorded something like 10,000 

968
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:21,104
hours or sorry,
10,000 minutes of conversation at the 

969
00:52:24,771 --> 00:52:26,930
table,
which could all be summarized.

970
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,240
And this was an example of clear cherry 
picking of data.

971
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:33,050
The only features of the conversation 
that were relevant were the way that the

972
00:52:33,051 --> 00:52:35,570
guys hit on the surfers are talked about
the servers,

973
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:36,733
you know,
various body parts or most importantly 

974
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:39,823
how much they enjoyed the fact that 
hooters provides them a place that they 

975
00:52:42,411 --> 00:52:43,244
can go and tell young,
attractive women what to do in a 

976
00:52:46,101 --> 00:52:46,934
situation in which they are 
contractually obligated to fulfill 

977
00:52:49,911 --> 00:52:51,350
those,
those orders.

978
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:54,080
Like literally double entendre on the 
work order.

979
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,380
Like please,
I would like some beer that's an order.

980
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,730
So,
um,

981
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:01,003
that was an example of clear cherry 
picking and of course deriving 

982
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:05,400
ridiculous conclusions.
Uh,

983
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:06,523
did you guys know while you were doing 
this that you are going to get yourself 

984
00:53:09,501 --> 00:53:11,480
in like a boatload of trouble?
I mean,

985
00:53:11,481 --> 00:53:13,180
and now I see when you're talking about 
it,

986
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,740
you laugh.
And so you still got a sense of humor,

987
00:53:15,741 --> 00:53:17,900
which is quite a remarkable thing.
You,

988
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,610
you did this for a long time and like,
yeah,

989
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:25,100
it's hard to believe actually that you 
did manage,

990
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:26,650
do it.
I have some,

991
00:53:26,651 --> 00:53:28,650
some moments especially where,
uh,

992
00:53:28,651 --> 00:53:29,484
I mean we were always aware that there 
would be a backlash and then when I 

993
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:35,030
started actually signing the transfer of
copyright,

994
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,630
the documents to have the papers 
actually published,

995
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,970
I started to feel a little like,
you know,

996
00:53:40,971 --> 00:53:42,770
we might really get in some trouble for 
this,

997
00:53:42,771 --> 00:53:45,080
but at this point we're kind of in deep 
and uh,

998
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:48,660
might as well carry on and try to finish
the experiment we had intended to,

999
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:53,670
to try to write papers for 12 months and
then spend six to eight months kind of,

1000
00:53:53,991 --> 00:53:55,340
you know,
following up.

1001
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:58,790
The academic publishing process is slow.
They do the review,

1002
00:53:58,791 --> 00:54:01,310
you get it back a couple months later,
you have to do edits.

1003
00:54:01,311 --> 00:54:04,070
It takes maybe another month or two 
before they accept or whatever.

1004
00:54:04,071 --> 00:54:06,290
Then publication may be another couple 
of months later.

1005
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:07,461
So it all,
it's slow.

1006
00:54:07,461 --> 00:54:08,720
So we wanted to do a lot,
you know,

1007
00:54:08,721 --> 00:54:09,554
six,
eight months after 12 months of writing 

1008
00:54:11,151 --> 00:54:15,410
and that was the intended duration that 
we should be wrapping up the project now

1009
00:54:15,411 --> 00:54:18,530
if we didn't get busted.
But about late summer,

1010
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:21,360
the dog park paper got picked up,
um,

1011
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:23,023
by some journalists and the real peer 
review and got made fun of it and we 

1012
00:54:25,191 --> 00:54:26,024
realized we were probably not going to 
make it to the end of our intended at 

1013
00:54:29,841 --> 00:54:30,674
year and a half ish time span.
So we ended up writing for 10 total 

1014
00:54:34,341 --> 00:54:36,350
months,
which is a bit of time and

1015
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:38,883
still under review,
which was really ashamed because I'm 

1016
00:54:41,021 --> 00:54:41,854
fairly sure,
but I do want to speak to that Jordan 

1017
00:54:44,951 --> 00:54:47,140
because somebody had to do this.

1018
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:50,200
Yeah.
Why?

1019
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:53,803
Because the ideology,
because these professors are looking at 

1020
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:57,794
their classrooms as an ideology mill and
they're attempting to indoctrinate 

1021
00:55:01,641 --> 00:55:06,170
people into things about reality that 
have nothing to do with reality.

1022
00:55:06,171 --> 00:55:07,004
They've placed an agenda ahead of the 
truth and it's corroding our 

1023
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:16,140
institutions in it's eroding trust in 
those universities and institutions.

1024
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:21,000
And you identified the problem.
Many people identified the problem,

1025
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,073
but something had to be done about it.
Beyond identification and calling these 

1026
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:26,124
people out.
We needed to show that needs to de 

1027
00:55:29,781 --> 00:55:30,614
legitimize these cannons because there 
the way that they were coming to 

1028
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,633
knowledges,
just epistemologically to to say it's 

1029
00:55:37,731 --> 00:55:40,070
not rigorous as chow is,
is charitable.

1030
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:43,630
So they're kind of a few pieces to that,
right?

1031
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:45,060
So you,
everybody is,

1032
00:55:45,061 --> 00:55:47,820
we mentioned a little bit earlier,
we touched upon um,

1033
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:51,290
is now familiar with the idea that 
racism and sexism don't seem to mean the

1034
00:55:51,291 --> 00:55:55,220
same thing they meant 10 years ago you 
used to be able to say racist and sexist

1035
00:55:55,221 --> 00:55:58,610
and amend discrimination based on race 
or sex and it could go in any direction.

1036
00:55:58,611 --> 00:56:03,140
But now it's got this power dynamic,
privileged plus power stuff.

1037
00:56:03,141 --> 00:56:05,330
Everybody's talking about privilege.
So that's everywhere.

1038
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:09,680
But if that's one dimension and it's 
impossible to avoid that,

1039
00:56:09,681 --> 00:56:14,210
the sociological or grievance studies 
definitions for concepts are,

1040
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,193
are everywhere.
But there are also two other pieces of 

1041
00:56:16,671 --> 00:56:17,504
evidence.
One that we saw before we started that 

1042
00:56:19,821 --> 00:56:21,860
would be a paper that was done by 
Charlotte,

1043
00:56:21,861 --> 00:56:26,861
a stern who,
how insular gender studies is.

1044
00:56:26,981 --> 00:56:27,814
How they literally took
the years since Steven pinker published 

1045
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:37,470
the blank slate 2003 until 2015 or 16 
she looked at a bunch of papers,

1046
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,333
got us a sample of those papers and 
determined whether or not they 

1047
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:45,250
incorporated or ignored the,
uh,

1048
00:56:45,251 --> 00:56:48,250
information that pinker had shared as a,
as a,

1049
00:56:48,251 --> 00:56:49,084
as a test and found that there was an 
overwhelming amount of just putting the 

1050
00:56:51,401 --> 00:56:52,234
blinkers on and pretending that biology 
still doesn't exist and that human 

1051
00:56:55,691 --> 00:56:56,950
nature is totally social.

1052
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,020
Part of that's not a pretense either.
Is that

1053
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:02,020
a pretense here?
I mean,

1054
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:05,530
the reason it's not a pretense is 
because as far as I can tell,

1055
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:08,260
the people who are in these disciplines,
no,

1056
00:57:08,261 --> 00:57:11,640
absolutely nothing whatsoever about 
biology,

1057
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,610
biology.
The more you don't want to know,

1058
00:57:17,611 --> 00:57:20,590
that you need to know because it's a 
daunting task.

1059
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,810
Yeah.
I want to speak to that for a moment.

1060
00:57:22,811 --> 00:57:26,140
If I may.
So at my university,

1061
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:29,410
a course offered on the philosophy of 
race,

1062
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:30,543
and it would seem to me that a minimum 
qualification one would need to teach 

1063
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:40,411
that is that one would have to have some
kind of degree in evolutionary biology.

1064
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:45,900
But that does not seem to be the case.
And I think,

1065
00:57:45,901 --> 00:57:48,090
again,
we're seeing consistently,

1066
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,640
you know,
race is such an explosive,

1067
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:51,933
explosive topic,
but when you start with the idea that 

1068
00:57:54,851 --> 00:57:58,300
you have the truth and then you work 
backward and Cherry pick the literature,

1069
00:57:58,301 --> 00:58:01,420
and in this case it's extraordinarily 
easy because you just go to these,

1070
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:02,883
the journals and the canons of 
literature and then you start teaching 

1071
00:58:04,841 --> 00:58:05,674
them.
So what happens then is the kind of the 

1072
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:12,571
self fulfillment of the postmodern 
condition is that they then manufacturer

1073
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:16,420
pieces of information that people take 
as knowledge.

1074
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,440
We see that happening in our 
institutions now and it's,

1075
00:58:20,441 --> 00:58:22,510
nobody's calling them out on it.
So it's again,

1076
00:58:22,511 --> 00:58:25,090
I say that because it speaks to your 
point of why didn't we do this?

1077
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,373
Because the public trust in these 
institutions as being eroded and we're 

1078
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:31,510
teaching our kids things that are just 
not true.

1079
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,960
They're just totally untethered to 
reality.

1080
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:37,840
Even though some of these people may be 
very well meaning

1081
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:40,070
and there's always a citation and we 
learned,

1082
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:42,120
there's always a cycle with the 
citation.

1083
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,260
You want to find something that says 
anything ridiculous about sex,

1084
00:58:45,261 --> 00:58:49,180
toys and anal taking care of,
there's questions,

1085
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:53,440
power dynamics using that already.
There's always this like that that maybe

1086
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:54,343
is the,
is the important thing to sort of 

1087
00:58:55,671 --> 00:58:57,740
realize it about what we did.
I mean,

1088
00:58:57,741 --> 00:59:00,920
all of that ridiculous stuff that,
that Jim was saying earlier,

1089
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,533
we were able to say that because there 
was already something out there which 

1090
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:07,533
led to it or set it itself.
And so if you're actually looking at 

1091
00:59:11,121 --> 00:59:11,954
what our project is,
something that's very important is our 

1092
00:59:14,571 --> 00:59:19,571
references because to me,
some of it really,

1093
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:22,220
yeah,
it's,

1094
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,490
there's this humorous,
it's a very humorous element in it,

1095
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:29,130
but on a deeper level,
what it is,

1096
00:59:29,131 --> 00:59:32,540
is just gathering so much of this 
nonsense together,

1097
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,033
citing it,
putting it in there and then kind of 

1098
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:36,763
making it do whatever it,
whatever we wanted it to do that that 

1099
00:59:39,681 --> 00:59:41,630
was,
was the project.

1100
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:42,543
Um,
and it's your point is that you have to 

1101
00:59:44,871 --> 00:59:49,871
embed yourself tire within a preexistent
literature or it couldn't float and

1102
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,240
like they really,
I mean a lot of the,

1103
00:59:57,710 --> 00:59:58,543
some of the academics have said,
well we haven't been fooled because we 

1104
01:00:01,341 --> 01:00:02,174
still stand by the papers.
What you wrote was reasonable because 

1105
01:00:05,151 --> 01:00:05,984
they are indistinguishable and that 
really was kind of the point we wanted 

1106
01:00:10,311 --> 01:00:10,970
to have.
We,

1107
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:11,803
we've ended up with a really good 
resource for anyone who wants to know 

1108
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:17,630
what is out there.
They can look at our references,

1109
01:00:17,631 --> 01:00:20,150
they can look at the arguments that they
enabled us to make.

1110
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:23,630
They can look at how the reviewers,
what they rejected us for,

1111
01:00:23,631 --> 01:00:26,330
what they accepted us for,
what they pushed us to do.

1112
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,810
There's a very clear pattern,
but because it is so complicated with so

1113
01:00:29,811 --> 01:00:30,644
few people have taken the time it would 
take to read all of our papers to read 

1114
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:38,180
all of the comments to follow up our rem
at references.

1115
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:43,460
It's not always clear that what we're 
doing is putting it right in the Canon.

1116
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:44,533
That is why
this has to do with the motivation of 

1117
01:00:48,501 --> 01:00:51,020
other academics.
Not to be bothered with this.

1118
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:52,833
The stuff that I'm most familiar with is
that about 80% of humanities papers get 

1119
01:00:57,261 --> 01:00:58,094
cited zero times and the problem is that
even to go after very bad ideas in an 

1120
01:01:03,651 --> 01:01:04,484
academically rigorous way is actually an
extraordinarily daunting task and it 

1121
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:11,250
might be daunting in direct proportion 
to the,

1122
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:14,300
to the appalling this of the ideas.

1123
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:15,393
So for example,
if you're creating a very bad 

1124
01:01:17,361 --> 01:01:18,194
undergraduate essay,
it's way more difficult to grade a d 

1125
01:01:22,161 --> 01:01:27,161
paper than it is to grade a b d paper 
has so many errors in it.

1126
01:01:27,231 --> 01:01:29,030
You don't even know where to start,
right?

1127
01:01:29,031 --> 01:01:31,190
The words are wrong,
the sentences are wrong,

1128
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,530
the sentences aren't organized in the 
paragraphs.

1129
01:01:33,531 --> 01:01:34,364
The paragraphs are chaotic and 
disjointed and the whole thing makes no 

1130
01:01:36,801 --> 01:01:37,634
sense and you actually have to do,
there isn't a level of criticism that 

1131
01:01:41,721 --> 01:01:42,554
can't be applied to a very bad paper and
so it's an absolutely exhausting 

1132
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:51,140
intellectually apart from the danger 
that it poses personally

1133
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:54,163
before we assume that it's mirror lack 
of character on the part of our fellow 

1134
01:01:58,761 --> 01:02:02,300
academics that is stopping them from 
taking a stand against such things.

1135
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:05,810
Although I do buy the sort of entrenched
power,

1136
01:02:05,811 --> 01:02:06,644
this idea that emerges as perhaps an 
inevitable consequence of participating 

1137
01:02:11,211 --> 01:02:12,560
in a structured hierarchy.

1138
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,193
It's there are,
there are many more reasons why this is 

1139
01:02:17,241 --> 01:02:19,650
forged,
including the inappropriate,

1140
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,753
what would you call it,
subsidization of these viewpoints for 

1141
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:25,300
the last 50 years.
Yeah,

1142
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,670
yeah.
I think that's right.

1143
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:30,180
It's really,
really painstaking to pour through these

1144
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:31,920
papers.
And as a,

1145
01:02:31,921 --> 01:02:33,150
as a person,
you know,

1146
01:02:33,151 --> 01:02:35,400
with a commitment to science and a 
background in science,

1147
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:36,234
it wasn't just even painstaking.
I actually went into some pretty dark 

1148
01:02:40,071 --> 01:02:42,260
places,
psychological places.

1149
01:02:42,261 --> 01:02:43,094
I remember reading the,
so I mentioned reading the glaciology 

1150
01:02:45,861 --> 01:02:47,530
paper earlier,
the feminists physiology,

1151
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,520
but I didn't read it in depth when we 
first found it.

1152
01:02:49,521 --> 01:02:50,354
But when we started to do this project,
I wanted to emulate it and write one 

1153
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:54,200
about feminists astronomy.

1154
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:59,600
And I read the thing in tremendous depth
and with great care,

1155
01:02:59,601 --> 01:03:02,030
taking notes all the way through and you
know,

1156
01:03:02,031 --> 01:03:04,310
preparing so I could could write effect 
similarly.

1157
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,430
And I shut down.
I mean,

1158
01:03:06,431 --> 01:03:07,264
I just almost locked myself in a room by
myself for three days in a dark 

1159
01:03:10,191 --> 01:03:15,191
depression that
quoting

1160
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,390
the same thing how to be when I was 
writing 12 rules for life,

1161
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,253
I wrote a chapter called don't bother 
children when they're skateboarding and 

1162
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:35,230
it's about the discouragement,
let's say of primarily of young men as a

1163
01:03:35,301 --> 01:03:36,134
direct consequence of this.
The kind of rhetoric that we're 

1164
01:03:37,641 --> 01:03:41,630
discussing and like that made me 
unbearable for my family for about three

1165
01:03:41,631 --> 01:03:42,464
months because the more I studied it,
the more it has a really fragmented and 

1166
01:03:47,211 --> 01:03:49,850
chaotic effect going on.
You psychologically,

1167
01:03:49,851 --> 01:03:52,580
and I've also seen this manifested in my
students,

1168
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:57,550
you know who undergo this kind of act of
this indoctrination.

1169
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:58,880
It's,
it's such a,

1170
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:03,710
it's such a corrosive and cynical view 
of the world that all we're,

1171
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,593
we're all in it in our groups and then 
all the groups are fighting one another 

1172
01:04:07,341 --> 01:04:11,270
for power and that that's the 
fundamental transcendent reality.

1173
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:12,463
It's just,

1174
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:13,680
yeah.
Now imagine,

1175
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:14,573
imagine the sort of person who looks at 
that as an epistomological and moral 

1176
01:04:18,631 --> 01:04:21,600
virtue and who teaches that to their 
students,

1177
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:26,430
who attempts to indoctrinate their 
students into these,

1178
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:28,770
not even,
they don't even arrive.

1179
01:04:28,771 --> 01:04:32,850
So level of being false in terms of 
these morally dangerous ideas.

1180
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,670
And then they think that they're better 
people as a result.

1181
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:38,010
And then they think that if somebody 
calls them out on it,

1182
01:04:38,011 --> 01:04:38,844
they're evil.

1183
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,200
Okay,
so let's look and look at this too.

1184
01:04:41,201 --> 01:04:43,930
So when high he,
Ted Lukey Nofx wrote the cognitive,

1185
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:44,793
the American mind,
one point they pointed out as the 

1186
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:49,923
American Psychological Association and 
the American Psychiatric Association 

1187
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,033
should have that all of the safe space 
and doctrines and trigger warning 

1188
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:58,420
doctrines and,
and,

1189
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,590
and that sort of thing.
Um,

1190
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:04,020
and the speech codes for example,
that are increasingly forbidding,

1191
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:04,863
even sarcasm are exactly the opposite of
the approach that you would take if you 

1192
01:05:09,341 --> 01:05:12,640
were a trained psychologist trying to 
produce people who are more resilient.

1193
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:13,623
You actually make them weaker and more 
anxiety provoking and more anxiety 

1194
01:05:17,261 --> 01:05:18,520
prone,
more depressed,

1195
01:05:18,521 --> 01:05:20,910
and more hopeless.
And I think the evidence for that,

1196
01:05:20,911 --> 01:05:21,744
it's absolutely clear and I think it's 
appalling that it wasn't clinical 

1197
01:05:24,011 --> 01:05:29,011
psychologists or psychiatrists who 
pointed it out and so it is that the,

1198
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:30,243
these doctrines are being put forth for 
the benefit of those who formulate the 

1199
01:05:33,251 --> 01:05:36,640
doctrines and that the students are 
sacrificial victims in that,

1200
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,020
in that process.

1201
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:38,913
Yeah.
There's one more piece that I think is 

1202
01:05:41,051 --> 01:05:43,090
important that goes back to what,
excuse me,

1203
01:05:43,091 --> 01:05:48,091
what Jim said about not seeing that a 
contradiction is problematic because the

1204
01:05:48,971 --> 01:05:49,804
whole idea of contradiction is white 
science or western science and that's 

1205
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:54,123
problematic is that we found that these 
folks don't really value discourse and 

1206
01:05:58,601 --> 01:06:03,601
dialogue and so they don't really value 
having ideas challenged and questioned.

1207
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:07,590
That's not there.
Their reason for teaching these ideas in

1208
01:06:07,591 --> 01:06:10,020
the first place and if I may give you a 
quick example,

1209
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:11,783
excuse me.
Well in State University wants to 

1210
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:19,080
include or has included at this point a,
a course on native American philosophy,

1211
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:20,940
which,
which I think is a great idea.

1212
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:22,493
And well,
somebody in the audience asked the 

1213
01:06:24,901 --> 01:06:25,734
question and the question was,
I went to a presentation and the 

1214
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:32,160
question is individual asked was,
well,

1215
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:36,000
what do we do as settlers,
as colonialists when we want to question

1216
01:06:36,001 --> 01:06:39,510
or challenge these ideas and native 
American philosophy.

1217
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:42,540
And the presenter said,
you know,

1218
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:45,210
I've struggled with this.
It's very difficult for me,

1219
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:46,463
but the bottom line was it shouldn't,
it should be exempt from traditional 

1220
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:53,150
tools that we have used for other 
disciplines.

1221
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,450
You know,
the dialectic challenging.

1222
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:57,673
And so that first of all,
that places me in an almost impossible 

1223
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:01,320
position.
What am,

1224
01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:02,990
what am I supposed to do?
Say,

1225
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:04,730
you know,
why is it exempt?

1226
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:05,923
It should play by the rules that every 
other philosophy because then I become 

1227
01:07:08,421 --> 01:07:11,390
the guy who hates western,
who hates,

1228
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,250
um,
uh,

1229
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:15,560
indigenous people who hates indigenous 
philosophy.

1230
01:07:15,561 --> 01:07:16,394
And then I'm the tool of the patriarchy,
which gets back to what you were 

1231
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:19,813
questioning or asking before is why do 
we have this violence in academia and 

1232
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:24,164
what's the problem with it?
So I think part of the problem is that 

1233
01:07:26,631 --> 01:07:29,540
these folks don't value discourse.
They don't value dialog,

1234
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:31,430
they don't value open expression,
they don't,

1235
01:07:31,431 --> 01:07:32,750
well,
they view that.

1236
01:07:32,751 --> 01:07:33,980
And again,
there's a paper for this,

1237
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,440
they view that as a type of violence.
Words are a type of mine,

1238
01:07:37,441 --> 01:07:38,274
so type of verbal violence.
And so then their students develop 

1239
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:45,280
brutal epistemologies because they've 
never heard the other side of the story.

1240
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:46,183
Right.
And they develop them just when they 

1241
01:07:47,121 --> 01:07:49,070
should be developing resilient,
resilient

1242
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,290
be correct.
And

1243
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:53,400
yeah,
and as a litmus test,

1244
01:07:53,401 --> 01:07:55,680
I always,
I always ask folks why,

1245
01:07:55,681 --> 01:07:58,470
who are gender studies in my class or 
study in the,

1246
01:07:58,471 --> 01:08:00,560
in the grievance studies fields,
what,

1247
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:05,450
why is it Martha Nussbaum is criticism 
of Judith Butler taught hair,

1248
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:07,200
single single students as,
yes,

1249
01:08:07,201 --> 01:08:09,360
I've learned about that in my class.
Well,

1250
01:08:09,361 --> 01:08:10,194
they don't,
they don't teach that because they have 

1251
01:08:11,851 --> 01:08:16,190
a prevailing orthodoxy and they want to 
indoctrinate with it and

1252
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:18,380
they've kind of hijack the 
administration.

1253
01:08:18,381 --> 01:08:21,830
And as I said before,
they've weaponized offices of diversity,

1254
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:22,664
inclusion,
etc. To punish people who are heretics 

1255
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:26,220
and who questioned or challenged.

1256
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:28,190
Okay.
So we're going to run out of time.

1257
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:31,220
We're running down to about 10 minutes 
here.

1258
01:08:31,221 --> 01:08:35,900
So I want to,
here's a question that I want to race to

1259
01:08:35,901 --> 01:08:36,734
all three of you have to,
I think one is why in the world should 

1260
01:08:39,621 --> 01:08:42,020
anybody outside of academia care about 
this?

1261
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,140
That's the first thing and very careful 
answer that.

1262
01:08:45,141 --> 01:08:46,850
And the second is,
um,

1263
01:08:48,050 --> 01:08:48,883
for each of you,
what's been the personal consequence of 

1264
01:08:51,111 --> 01:08:51,944
this and would you have repeated it if 
you knew what the consequences were 

1265
01:08:55,311 --> 01:08:56,520
going to be?
So let's,

1266
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:58,730
let's start with the first one.
Why in the world should they,

1267
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,820
why in the world should anyone care that
some half did?

1268
01:09:01,821 --> 01:09:05,840
Academic Journal published an insane 
paper by three renegade,

1269
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:08,510
uh,
academics about what,

1270
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:11,870
about dorm rate of all the absurd,
uh,

1271
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:12,421
of,
of,

1272
01:09:12,421 --> 01:09:14,600
of,
of the observed observed topics.

1273
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:16,903
It's so surreal that it seems
virtually in comprehensible sensible 

1274
01:09:23,271 --> 01:09:25,430
people should avoid it.
So what's the answer to that?

1275
01:09:26,890 --> 01:09:28,430
Well,
go ahead Helen.

1276
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:33,480
The university.

1277
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:35,420
Okay.

1278
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:36,253
It,
it is our source of knowledge 

1279
01:09:37,161 --> 01:09:39,320
production.
If we look back through history,

1280
01:09:39,321 --> 01:09:40,154
when our cultures were Christian,
the new knowledge about this was coming 

1281
01:09:43,341 --> 01:09:46,760
from the universities.
When we had the scientific revolution,

1282
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:50,840
when we went into the enlightenment,
this was coming from the universities.

1283
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:54,070
These things don't stay in the 
universities.

1284
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:54,953
We have seen it is coming out in what is
essentially happened with the kind of 

1285
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:01,543
identity studies that we're looking at 
is that it has been made directly 

1286
01:10:04,521 --> 01:10:05,354
actionable by activists,
has been tagged onto the end of the 

1287
01:10:09,141 --> 01:10:11,990
civil rights movements and liberal 
feminism and gay pride.

1288
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:16,790
When those movements have started to see
diminishing returns and people wanted to

1289
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:18,320
continue,
then it's,

1290
01:10:18,321 --> 01:10:22,160
it's tacked onto the end of that to a 
society which has just seeing the end of

1291
01:10:22,161 --> 01:10:22,994
empire,
the end of Jim Crow and is geared 

1292
01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:28,600
towards towards social justice and it is
it,

1293
01:10:28,601 --> 01:10:29,930
is it a c did here

1294
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:31,963
it's also a warning to the corporations 
because it's permeating the HR 

1295
01:10:34,581 --> 01:10:36,430
departments don't.
Yes,

1296
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:38,213
it's going to stay in the universities 
and don't be thinking that you can 

1297
01:10:40,461 --> 01:10:43,760
import 2% of it without importing the 
other 98% will.

1298
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:45,083
Yeah.
People Leave University and they join 

1299
01:10:46,411 --> 01:10:47,430
these industries.
Also,

1300
01:10:47,431 --> 01:10:48,264
there's pressure on corporations to 
comply with the reigning moral 

1301
01:10:52,921 --> 01:10:53,790
orthodoxy.
I mean,

1302
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:54,683
I don't think that the average business 
owner or the average person in the 

1303
01:10:57,691 --> 01:11:02,691
street knows anything about Sukkot or 
crenshaw or even thinks much about this,

1304
01:11:03,151 --> 01:11:07,110
but it is in the air now and it is.
It is affecting,

1305
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:08,483
it is affecting everything and we do 
need to take it seriously without sort 

1306
01:11:12,091 --> 01:11:14,010
of having a moral,
we need to

1307
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:18,810
look at it calmly and empirically and 
address it as it actually is.

1308
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:20,063
And what should we do about it?
That's the next issue because the 

1309
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:25,030
podcast,
no.

1310
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:25,741
Okay,
fine.

1311
01:11:25,741 --> 01:11:28,830
That's another point.
Then the final question for all three of

1312
01:11:28,831 --> 01:11:31,900
you is and maybe one at a time.
Um,

1313
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,940
when you do it again,
I would,

1314
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:37,530
yeah,
I would definitely do it again.

1315
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:38,670
Um,
okay.

1316
01:11:38,671 --> 01:11:41,040
So we know that you're an unrepentant 
troublemaker

1317
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:45,210
in trouble.
I've also found like my one great talent

1318
01:11:45,211 --> 01:11:48,450
in the world and I feel like I've made 
my own life obsolete now.

1319
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:51,540
Okay.
Wonderful.

1320
01:11:51,541 --> 01:11:53,670
Bullshit artist.
If anybody's looking for one,

1321
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:56,160
um,
yeah,

1322
01:11:56,161 --> 01:11:57,870
I would definitely do it again.
It's worth the risk.

1323
01:11:57,871 --> 01:11:59,850
I think it needed to be done.
Helen,

1324
01:11:59,851 --> 01:12:02,040
let's ask you next and then we'll get 
let,

1325
01:12:02,041 --> 01:12:02,874
Peter has the last word because he's the
one that's got the most on the line at 

1326
01:12:05,011 --> 01:12:05,844
the moment.

1327
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:13,710
I was imagining all sorts of things from
being arrested under sort of hate speech

1328
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:17,190
acts to being physically attacked 
because I have an uncommon name.

1329
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:18,323
I've had an awful lot online abuse.
I've got some persistent store because 

1330
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:23,773
that has a sentiment that I probably 
won't get into a phd program in my own 

1331
01:12:27,451 --> 01:12:28,051
country.
They,

1332
01:12:28,051 --> 01:12:31,970
somebody in Germany,
it's been,

1333
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,330
um,
it's been,

1334
01:12:33,331 --> 01:12:37,220
it's been quite nice.
Okay.

1335
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:42,360
Peter
had to be done.

1336
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:43,223
There's a crisis in the universities.
Does a crisis with knowledge production 

1337
01:12:46,171 --> 01:12:51,171
is a crisis of confidence
and a heavy price to me.

1338
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:55,410
And I have had to weigh out my family 
obligations,

1339
01:12:55,411 --> 01:12:58,090
helping put my son through school,
you know,

1340
01:12:58,530 --> 01:12:59,363
being a part of
being in a relationship in which I 

1341
01:13:03,331 --> 01:13:07,230
economically contribute to the house.
But this had to be done.

1342
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:11,400
And if I am a consequence of this,
then so be it.

1343
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,500
It had to be done.
Yeah.

1344
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:13,560
Well,
Peter Work,

1345
01:13:13,561 --> 01:13:14,394
there's a bunch of us who are not 
particularly inclined to let you be a 

1346
01:13:16,981 --> 01:13:17,814
sole sacrificial victim.
So if you're a university wants to get 

1347
01:13:20,341 --> 01:13:22,520
too stupid with you,
then um,

1348
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:23,993
let's,
let's assume that they're going to be 

1349
01:13:24,841 --> 01:13:28,230
consequences.
I sincerely appreciate your support from

1350
01:13:28,231 --> 01:13:29,430
the bottom of my heart.
Thank you.

1351
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:30,810
Yeah,
well enough is enough.

1352
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:32,670
So,
well look guys,

1353
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:34,440
it was really good talking to you.
All of them.

1354
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:35,753
I think that you're quite the
surreal bunch of troublemakers and 

1355
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:44,510
perhaps exactly what this crazy 
situation requires and

1356
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:48,750
well,
and I hope that,

1357
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:49,793
I hope Peter,
that that things work out for you 

1358
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:52,663
properly over the next few years.
It's going to be a tough haul for a 

1359
01:13:54,641 --> 01:13:55,730
while.
There's no doubt.

1360
01:13:56,710 --> 01:13:59,400
Are you getting any student support at 
your university?

1361
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:02,550
Getting a lot of students support the 
university,

1362
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:04,140
but you know,
I have to be,

1363
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:07,860
people would threaten to attack me a few
weeks ago.

1364
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:08,694
Someone spit at me,
my colleagues literally while walked on 

1365
01:14:11,261 --> 01:14:12,160
the card or they'll turn

1366
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:12,993
their heads.
It's,

1367
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,290
it's uh,
but then you know,

1368
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:15,460
the uncomfortable things,

1369
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:18,430
not much different from the typical 
university.

1370
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:21,320
Yeah,
it's,

1371
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:25,860
it has seem to be.
I am.

1372
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:27,103
I mean,
I,

1373
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:28,793
I want to be blunt with you.
It is a concern for my safety in 

1374
01:14:33,691 --> 01:14:36,240
Portland when I leave the house now.
Yeah.

1375
01:14:36,241 --> 01:14:37,074
And I've now been Trenton on more than 
one occasion by people and I'm 

1376
01:14:42,241 --> 01:14:43,074
concerned.

1377
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:46,270
Do you find the threats credible?
I mean,

1378
01:14:46,271 --> 01:14:48,250
I know every,
every threat is upsetting,

1379
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:49,084
but like are you actually in a situation
where you have some apprehension about 

1380
01:14:52,271 --> 01:14:53,110
leaving your house

1381
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:56,710
or,
I won't have any apprehension.

1382
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,940
Uh,
look,

1383
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:00,021
I,
you know,

1384
01:15:00,021 --> 01:15:03,010
I wake up in the morning and I get 
emails and tweets,

1385
01:15:03,011 --> 01:15:05,160
people telling me how stupid I am and 
wouldn't,

1386
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:06,133
you know,
bad person I am and how I'm a homophobe 

1387
01:15:07,481 --> 01:15:08,271
and racist,
et Cetera.

1388
01:15:08,271 --> 01:15:10,300
I then,
it doesn't do anything to me.

1389
01:15:10,301 --> 01:15:14,230
But when I walk out in the street,
so the bar a few weeks ago,

1390
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,740
or maybe a few months ago,
I don't even know mine for timelines,

1391
01:15:17,741 --> 01:15:18,640
but you know,
someone,

1392
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:20,213
someone came up to me and he started 
harassing me as fortunately as with my 

1393
01:15:23,701 --> 01:15:25,150
Jujitsu coach,
John Davis,

1394
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:27,833
a black belt in Jujitsu.
And he immediately pulled up the chair 

1395
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:33,080
beside us and I kept saying,
let's talk.

1396
01:15:33,081 --> 01:15:34,490
Let's have a conversation.
No,

1397
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:37,520
he followed me in the bathroom.
I came out of the bathroom.

1398
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:38,481
Finally,
I said,

1399
01:15:38,481 --> 01:15:40,190
look,
I don't know what's happening.

1400
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:42,980
I don't know why you're so upset and I'm
happy to talk to you.

1401
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:45,440
And he said,
I don't want to talk to Peter.

1402
01:15:45,441 --> 01:15:46,950
I want to hurt.
And it,

1403
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,261
oh,
that's pretty,

1404
01:15:48,261 --> 01:15:49,490
that's pretty serious.

1405
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:51,730
Yeah.
And then it happened again on the street

1406
01:15:51,731 --> 01:15:55,690
when I was surrounded.
We can half ago by people,

1407
01:15:56,080 --> 01:16:01,080
I assume they're anti for people or 
something clearly wanted to hurt me.

1408
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:03,340
Uh,
so you know,

1409
01:16:03,341 --> 01:16:05,320
I am,
I am concerned.

1410
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:06,660
I am concerned about

1411
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,740
those for people who haven't been 
through it.

1412
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:10,583
It's very hard for people who haven't 
been through that sort of thing to 

1413
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:15,320
understand just exactly how distressing 
that kind of occurrence is.

1414
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:18,890
Not only because it happens,
but because it could happen again and it

1415
01:16:18,891 --> 01:16:21,560
could become more serious.
So I'm really sorry to hear that.

1416
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:23,380
I didn't realize it didn't come to that.
That's,

1417
01:16:23,570 --> 01:16:24,800
that's no laughing matter.

1418
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:30,390
I appreciate that.
It's got anything to do with you.

1419
01:16:31,461 --> 01:16:32,294
And there's,
there's this will stick because there's 

1420
01:16:33,141 --> 01:16:36,860
insults,
leaflets and notices and yeah,

1421
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:40,693
that kind of stuff doesn't bother me.
It's when it's in the physical world 

1422
01:16:44,121 --> 01:16:46,760
where I feel,
I feel someone,

1423
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:49,250
I mean if someone tells you they're 
going to hurt you,

1424
01:16:49,251 --> 01:16:50,630
you should take their word for it.
Yes,

1425
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:51,550
definitely.
When,

1426
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:53,890
when it's that direct and when it 
started in your face,

1427
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,890
those threats are credible.
That that's,

1428
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:57,730
that's a real,
that's a real danger.

1429
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:59,890
So,
well look,

1430
01:16:59,891 --> 01:17:00,724
I'm really sorry to hear that and I'm,
I'm also sorry to hear that you're 

1431
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:05,103
paying a substantial,
I'm sorry to hear a general that you're 

1432
01:17:07,001 --> 01:17:09,250
paying a substantial price for that.
Um,

1433
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,333
I'm going to do what I can for what 
that's worth to try to make sure that 

1434
01:17:13,401 --> 01:17:15,530
people hear about this and that you're 
not in it alone.

1435
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:18,710
Because I think you guys are like 
comedians.

1436
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:19,693
You know,
your canaries in the coal mine and 

1437
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:23,820
whatever happens to you is going to 
happen to a lot of other people if,

1438
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:28,370
if it's allowed to happen to you so it 
can't be allowed to happen to you.

1439
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:32,240
That's what it looks like to me.
So thank you for your support.

1440
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:34,130
All right guys.
Well,

1441
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:36,230
thanks a lot for talking to me all.
Uh,

1442
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:37,873
it was,
it was a stupidly interesting talking 

1443
01:17:41,751 --> 01:17:42,584
with you,
but I just did not believe it's come to 

1444
01:17:47,811 --> 01:17:48,321
this.
You know,

1445
01:17:48,321 --> 01:17:51,200
it's so ridiculous.
If you can't,

1446
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:53,540
you couldn't invent this in a bad piece 
of fiction.

1447
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:56,920
And it's,
it's so sad that,

1448
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:57,933
that this is the sort of thing that we 
have to occupy ourselves when there's 

1449
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,910
serious work to be done.
All right,

1450
01:18:04,911 --> 01:18:06,500
well,
happy new year,

1451
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:07,453
I suppose.
Hopefully this'll be a watershed year 

1452
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:11,700
and things will get more intelligent 
from here on end.

1453
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:12,600
Again,
I'm,

1454
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:14,840
I'm sure,
hoping that'll be the case me to.

1455
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,490
Thank you.
All Right,

1456
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:17,324
ladies and gentlemen,
thank you very much for your time and 

1457
01:18:19,881 --> 01:18:22,160
I'll let you know when this is all 
coming online.

1458
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:23,023
Okay,

1459
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:24,963
bye.
Bye.
