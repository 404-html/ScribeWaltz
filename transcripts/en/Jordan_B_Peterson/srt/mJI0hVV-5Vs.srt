1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,533
Sorry.
I think

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,693
this part of the course,
it's always a part I have difficulty 

3
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:13,620
with because the conceptual 
transformation is very,

4
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:16,800
very large because so far we've been 
talking about,

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:18,943
um,
I would say biological and evolutionary 

6
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:22,554
realities in a sense.
And we've been doing that in a 

7
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:29,610
relatively standard manner.
I mean,

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,160
there are elements of Piaget Yeti in 
theory that run through it.

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,503
There are elements of cybernetic theory.
There are elements of neurobiology in 

10
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:40,070
neuropsychology,
and

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,410
none of it,
none of it,

12
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:44,963
I would say in some sense,
is radically outside the way the sorts 

13
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:54,021
of problems might be discussed
in,

14
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:54,921
uh,
in,

15
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:55,521
uh,
in,

16
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:57,050
uh,
in the typical,

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,880
in a typical scientific or social 
scientific manner,

18
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:10,110
except for maybe the fact that we've 
drawn a explicit distinction between the

19
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:14,500
world as a place of things in the world 
as a place of action.

20
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:19,803
Now,
there are consequences to the idea that 

21
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:22,564
the world is a place of action that 
start to become more radical at this 

22
00:01:24,941 --> 00:01:25,774
point.
But drawing the relationship between 

23
00:01:28,931 --> 00:01:29,764
what I've already talked to you about 
and the narrative domains that we're 

24
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,330
going to explore now requires a
like a radical shift in,

25
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:42,903
in conceptual focus.
And so the way I'm going to handle that 

26
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:51,621
is by hitting it from 10 or 11 different
directions and building up a pattern.

27
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,190
Know if you listened to a complex piece 
of music,

28
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,083
or at least this is my experience with 
complex music is sometimes the first 

29
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:04,160
time I hear it,
I don't really like it and I don't,

30
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,380
I don't,
I think I also don't understand it.

31
00:02:06,381 --> 00:02:08,420
I actually can't hear it.
You know,

32
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:11,060
maybe a musical genius could hear the 
whole thing instantly,

33
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:14,450
you know,
say a Franz Liszt,

34
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,750
they say he could sight read anything on
the piano first try.

35
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,761
So,
you know,

36
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:20,594
some people are so intelligent musically
that it's incomprehensible and I'm sure 

37
00:02:23,841 --> 00:02:26,000
they hear things,
just find the first time they hear them.

38
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:29,750
But then what happens for me is that if 
I listened to it a couple of more times,

39
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:31,180
there are pieces,
chunks of it,

40
00:02:31,181 --> 00:02:33,140
it starts to fall into place that I can 
follow.

41
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:33,890
And,
and you know,

42
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,723
I can see the beauty sort of shine 
through those and then eventually the 

43
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,690
whole thing links together and then I 
can listen to it.

44
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,540
Especially if it's a complex complex 
piece of music many,

45
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:45,950
many,
many times.

46
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,580
And the more complex and probably the 
better the piece of music,

47
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:50,414
the more I can listen to it.
But if I listen to it enough at some 

48
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:53,414
point then I've had enough of it.
And it's all very strange phenomenon 

49
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,233
because one of the things you might ask 
yourself is what exactly are you 

50
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:02,420
learning while you're doing that?
You're,

51
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,570
you know,
it seems like you want the music,

52
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:05,404
it's something like you want the music 
to be just exactly the right amount of 

53
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:10,384
predictable and unpredictable.
And if it's too unpredictable then you 

54
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:13,990
can't understand it.
And if it's too predictable,

55
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:14,824
it's boring.
And so it's just like a conversation 

56
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:18,820
that way.
It's actually just like life as well,

57
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,013
you know,
because you want things to be 

58
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,663
predictable and stable and you want 
things to be unpredictable and 

59
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,850
interesting and the degree to which you 
want.

60
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,863
Each of those is going to depend on the 
time and the context and also on your 

61
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:36,040
own intelligence and temperament.
So

62
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,240
now I'm going to tell you a bunch of 
stories and give you a bunch of a number

63
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:47,050
of pieces of information and hopefully 
they'll click together.

64
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,873
Now I think the reason that this 
information has always been transmitted 

65
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,290
in story and image form is because it's 
very,

66
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,124
very difficult to transform it into 
articulated like into fully articulated 

67
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:00,820
explanation.
It isn't really how it works,

68
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,983
you know,
we're not really accustomed to thinking 

69
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:03,934
about the idea that there are certain 
forms of information that and that that 

70
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:11,170
are valid forms of information that 
can't be transmitted verbally.

71
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:14,290
But of course if you think about it,
we all understand this deeply because,

72
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,120
well,
I can give you a bunch of examples.

73
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,230
The first example is that when you 
speak,

74
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,640
not only view speak in words and phrases
and sentences and paragraphs,

75
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,380
but you also speak melodically.

76
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,023
And in fact,
part of the reason that you can 

77
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:30,034
understand melodies and that they make 
sense to you is that what artists have 

78
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:34,744
done is separated the melodic element of
speech from the semantic element and 

79
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:43,870
then played with the melodic element.
And the melodic element tends to carry a

80
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:44,704
lot of emotion and intent.
And so if you're listening to someone 

81
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,610
speak,
you can tell when they're being ironic,

82
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,563
you know,
because they'd raised an eyebrow and 

83
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:56,170
their voice changes slightly,
even though they might be using,

84
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,480
in fact they are using exactly the same 
words.

85
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:01,600
And in fact someone who's very good at 
being witty or ironic,

86
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,100
we'll set the situation up so that you 
can barely tell that they're joking.

87
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:06,934
And the better they are at that,
the Tinier the hint they give you that 

88
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:12,190
you can still catch on to the final 
year.

89
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,043
The situation is so,
so we know that information can be 

90
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:19,240
transmitted through nonverbal channels.

91
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,093
It even happens during speech.
And then of course we understand that 

92
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:26,494
music presents to us an intimation of 
meaning that's very difficult to fully 

93
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:34,960
grasp.
And music for me has always been,

94
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:35,800
uh,
uh,

95
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,933
ineffable phenomena in some sense 
because it carries the intimation of 

96
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:42,334
meaning in a manner that can't be 
rationally dismissed or that people 

97
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:47,620
aren't interested in rationally 
dismissing.

98
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:52,210
So you've even punk rock nihilists 
listened to Punk Rock,

99
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:54,320
nihilistic music and they,
you know,

100
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,380
they find that meaningful even though 
they don't believe in meaning.

101
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,191
And then,
you know,

102
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,024
in some sense they're victims of their 
own rationality because they do believe 

103
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:04,190
in meaning or they wouldn't be listening
to the music,

104
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:06,890
but they can't understand how they could
possibly believe in it.

105
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:10,490
So their rational mind has dispensed 
with the idea.

106
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:11,324
And sometimes that's people dispense 
with the idea of meaning for lots of 

107
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:15,920
reasons,
partly because of,

108
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,340
because it's inevitable in some sense 
with sufficient rationality,

109
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,473
but also because,
because it's always useful to look for 

110
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:28,661
the underbelly of things because it also
justifies not bearing any responsibility

111
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:31,280
for your life and not had some fairly,
um,

112
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,683
what that can be a very desirable side 
effect of a particular ideological 

113
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:37,490
irrational belief.

114
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,593
And then there's dance of course,
and dances even more ineffable than 

115
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:44,510
music,
although it's often paired with music,

116
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:45,344
you know,
and it's,

117
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,693
and if it grips people,
if you see a remarkable downs 

118
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:50,234
performance,
well part of it is that you're sort of 

119
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,540
thrilled and excited about seeing just 
exactly what the human form can do.

120
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,793
You know,
because perhaps partly because you're 

121
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:04,001
human and when you see someone extending
a certain ability far beyond the norm,

122
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,900
then it expands your sense of what a 
human being is capable of.

123
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:10,130
So there's,
so there's that,

124
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:10,964
there's just the pure scale element.
And then there's the novelty element 

125
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:17,510
because often if you watch a 
particularly good dancer,

126
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:18,344
there's things they do that you haven't 
seen before that you didn't know anyone 

127
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:21,464
can do and that's pretty fun and then 
often the dances is joined with the 

128
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:26,534
music and the body is expressing what 
the music means and even though you 

129
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:30,464
can't tell what the music means,
you can tell that the dance is 

130
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:36,980
expressing it and see,
I think what happens there is that music

131
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,263
represents the patterns of being,
it's actually because people think of 

132
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:43,790
music has a non representational art but
I think that's wrong.

133
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,623
I think it might be the most 
representational art is that being is 

134
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:51,920
made up of layers of pattern,
layers of patterns constantly interact,

135
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,933
interacting and hopefully in a 
relatively harmonious way and music 

136
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,370
music demonstrates that,
mimics it in some sense abstractly.

137
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,980
And then the dance is an abstract 
representation.

138
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:04,814
Like people adapt to the patterns of 
being and the dancer adapts to the 

139
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,710
pattern of music.
And so it's a,

140
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:15,040
it's a symbolic,
it's an embodied display of the place of

141
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:17,390
the person in the cosmos.
And you can,

142
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,253
you can also make that case when you see
people dancing in pairs because you can 

143
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:22,304
dance alone or you can dance in pairs.
And that's basically standard human 

144
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:26,930
adaptation.
So,

145
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,660
and music is interesting too because one
of the things that you'll notice is that

146
00:08:32,661 --> 00:08:36,920
there's always music in a movie.
Almost always there's the odd movie that

147
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:37,890
doesn't have it,
but it's,

148
00:08:37,891 --> 00:08:39,800
it's quite marked when it's absent.

149
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,633
You know,
the movie feels a lot more cold and 

150
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:43,640
clinical,
although it can work.

151
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:49,060
But we accept the idea that music can be
used to fill in the missing context in a

152
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:51,380
movie without even ever questioning it.
Right?

153
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:53,630
Like it's very strange if you think 
about it,

154
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:54,464
that you go to a movie that is doing,
at least at least part of its function 

155
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,960
is to portray reality in a realistic 
way.

156
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,990
But there's a soundtrack playing in the 
background all the time.

157
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:05,010
And you don't,
you know,

158
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:05,844
it,
it's so useful and so appropriate that 

159
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:12,330
you don't notice how strange it is that 
that's okay.

160
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,570
So,
so my point is,

161
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:18,330
is that we,
well,

162
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:19,164
and then of course you can talk about 
novels and plays the same way because 

163
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,083
you know,
there's a lot more to a novel then than 

164
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:27,470
the words themselves.
There's,

165
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,353
you know,
we had a novel is a deeply layered 

166
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:29,870
thing.

167
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,703
And,
and part of your understanding of the 

168
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:37,740
novel novel is your understanding of the
interrelationships between the layers,

169
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:40,740
especially if it's a profound novel.
And I mean,

170
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:43,560
I think this is why we have the sense of
depth in,

171
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,380
in artistic and literary works.
Like if it,

172
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,840
if work is deep,
then it has many,

173
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:52,800
many layers and the more layers it has 
interacting at the same time,

174
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,480
the more it's a useful representation of
the essential elements of being.

175
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:58,314
And so the more meaningful it is to us.
So that's all to say that there are 

176
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:04,404
modes of communication that provide us 
with information that we can't 

177
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:09,960
articulate,
but that we still act,

178
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,660
we still act as if that information is 
valid.

179
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,490
And you might say,
well,

180
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,670
valid for what?
What exactly is it doing?

181
00:10:17,671 --> 00:10:18,504
What is it representing?
What kind of information is it offering 

182
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,100
that's so compelling?

183
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,933
And what's so interesting about it is 
the kind of information that we're 

184
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:26,544
talking about,
that information is so compelling that 

185
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:32,910
you'll pay to expose yourself to it.
You know,

186
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:36,780
it's a rare lecture that you'll go to 
and have to pay for the lecture itself.

187
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:38,340
I mean,
you'll come to the university and you'll

188
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:41,490
get your degree,
but if you had your option on a Saturday

189
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:43,860
afternoon or a Saturday night,
let's say,

190
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,430
it's relatively unlikely that you would 
attend a lecture,

191
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:50,100
and certainly even more unlikely that 
you would pay to attend one,

192
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:53,640
but you'll certainly pay to go somewhere
to dance to music.

193
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,020
And you know why that is is not obvious.
You know,

194
00:10:58,021 --> 00:10:58,501
you say,
well,

195
00:10:58,501 --> 00:10:59,010
it's,
it's,

196
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,150
it's entertaining.
It's like,

197
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:00,990
yeah,
it's entertaining.

198
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,490
All right?
But it's a lot more than that.

199
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:06,720
And I think that dismissing things that 
are enjoyable as entertainment,

200
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,590
which means they're sort of peripheral,
they're unimportant in some sense,

201
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,290
which is often what?
It's a real,

202
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,170
it's a real terrible habit of 
psychologists.

203
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:19,800
So for example,
when Steven pinker wrote his book,

204
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,100
it's the book on language and 
unfortunate,

205
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:25,530
I can't remember the name at the moment.
Um,

206
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,453
he devoted one chapter at the end 
basically to nonverbal cultural forms 

207
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:31,110
and he talked about them as

208
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,573
s

209
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,190
epic.
Phenomenal.

210
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,140
Fundamentally,
you know,

211
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:36,974
they're just,
they're a byproduct and I think that's 

212
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:39,914
deeply wrong.
I think that our culture actually grew 

213
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:47,801
out of dance and drama and music and 
science came way,

214
00:11:48,981 --> 00:11:49,760
way later than

215
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,260
math.
And

216
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,293
yeah,

217
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,920
I was watching an old video today,
um,

218
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,890
was up to the animals playing house of 
the rising sun in 1964.

219
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,650
It's a pretty good video and it's a 
great old song.

220
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,360
I mean,
they didn't write it.

221
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,223
It's an old blues song,
but it's a great old song and they do a 

222
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:11,170
pretty,
pretty good job of it.

223
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:16,150
And the audience was full of girls and 
they were screaming madly away.

224
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:17,770
Now it wasn't quite as bad as the 
Beatles,

225
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:21,370
which was completely unbelievable,
but it was still,

226
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:22,204
you know,
a fairly continual den of delighted 

227
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:27,340
shrieks.
And you know,

228
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,713
I think that's extremely interesting 
because you'd never see that at a 

229
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:33,100
scientific conference.
Well,

230
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:34,180
it's,
it's strange,

231
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,470
like there isn't anything else that 
elicits that kind of response.

232
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,240
Um,
maybe,

233
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:44,530
maybe sports to some minimal degree,
but certainly nowhere near the same,

234
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,050
nowhere near it with the same amount of 
enthusiasm.

235
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,550
And you know,
one of the things you,

236
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:50,560
and I mean,
that's been happening for a long time.

237
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,500
It wasn't merely a phenomena of the 60s.
I mean,

238
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,813
I suspect it's been happening ever since
there's been wandering minstrels and 

239
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,050
that's a very,
very long time.

240
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:03,010
And I suspect those wandering minstrels 
left many offspring behind them.

241
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,420
I know.
And well,

242
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,150
what's interesting about that is,
you know,

243
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:07,984
I mean obviously part of the reason that
human beings can sing is because we've 

244
00:13:10,571 --> 00:13:12,520
selected each other for that ability.
Right?

245
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:13,354
Do you mean there's something very 
attractive about someone who's 

246
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,143
artistically gifted and
the idea that women will do back flips 

247
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,283
for,
uh,

248
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,333
for a singer is not necessarily any 
negative comment on their ability to 

249
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,260
evaluate what's important.
It might be quite the reverse.

250
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,123
So,

251
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:34,840
okay.

252
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,673
So anyways,
the point is there's lots of different 

253
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:39,430
ways that we can convey information and 
you might say,

254
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:40,264
well,
it's only simple information that can 

255
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:42,610
be,
can be conveyed that way.

256
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:46,750
And you have to convey the complex 
information in more formal forms,

257
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,410
scientific and philosophical.
But I think that's exactly backwards.

258
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,813
I think we get,
we get to articulate the simple stuff 

259
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:55,930
first,
which is only what you'd expect,

260
00:13:55,931 --> 00:13:56,530
right?
Because if,

261
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,363
when you're,
when you're mastering something 

262
00:13:58,361 --> 00:13:59,650
difficult,
like the,

263
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,840
uh,
the unfolding of being,

264
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:02,674
the probability that you're going to get
to the simple things first and 

265
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,440
complicated things later is pretty much 
100%.

266
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:09,274
And I mean,
different fields advance at different 

267
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:11,470
speeds,
but

268
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:13,923
about the artists and the musicians get 
to the complex matters far before the 

269
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,360
scientists and the engineers.
And it has to be that way.

270
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,060
One of the deep things I learned from 
young was that,

271
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,420
okay,

272
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,020
well as soon as our knowledge expands 
out into the unknown,

273
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,240
there are people operating at the 
periphery.

274
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:34,150
And so they're,
they,

275
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,770
they really have one foot in the unknown
and one foot on dry land,

276
00:14:37,771 --> 00:14:38,604
so to speak.
And some of the more and more in the 

277
00:14:39,991 --> 00:14:43,050
water than others.
And the ones who are almost submerged up

278
00:14:43,051 --> 00:14:45,210
to their neck,
when they tell you what they're seeing,

279
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:46,044
it's it,
it has to be poetic and musical and 

280
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:48,504
artistic because it's so far beyond our 
capacity to articulate that we can't 

281
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:53,714
represent it in words.
And so all that can happen is the 

282
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:59,030
artists can get ahold of it and maybe 
they're religious.

283
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,470
They're the people who are prone to 
religious life sentiments,

284
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:04,304
which at least experiences,
which seems to be associated by the way 

285
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:07,394
with trade openness to have the actual 
religious experience rather than to be 

286
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:14,360
an inherent of the dogma which is 
associated with low openness.

287
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,820
So for young,
you know,

288
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:17,654
it was the artists and the entrepreneurs
because they're the same people who are 

289
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:25,550
at the forefront of the expansion of 
what we know into what is unknown.

290
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:29,840
And I think you can see echoes of that 
in the way that cities are rejuvenated.

291
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,340
You know,
because what happens,

292
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:35,420
you can certainly see this in Toronto,
is that a part of the city that has some

293
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:39,620
architectural or contextual interest but
is badly run down,

294
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,990
starts to get at some point,
you know,

295
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,200
the artistic people show up and they 
think,

296
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,043
hey,
you know,

297
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,970
this is kind of cool if we just did this
to it,

298
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:48,804
it would,
you know,

299
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,850
they're re we really something to it.
And it's usually,

300
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:54,560
it doesn't hurt that the rents are low 
because of course artists never have any

301
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:55,394
money.
So then they go in there and civilize 

302
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:58,130
the hell out of it.

303
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:58,963
And of course they're ranting and that 
drag jacks up the property values and 

304
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:02,474
then the people who are a little less 
open but kinda interested in art start 

305
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:06,014
flowing in behind them.
And then soon the whole place is 

306
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,373
rejuvenated and expensive.
And of course the artists have to go 

307
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:12,580
somewhere else.
But they,

308
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,650
so,
but that,

309
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,330
that's a very interesting phenomena 
because what's happening is that even in

310
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:21,110
the cities,
they're taking chaos and turning it into

311
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:22,910
order.
And that's what artists do.

312
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:27,010
So now that's all to tell you that there
are different ways of,

313
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,670
of,
of,

314
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,290
uh,
transmitting,

315
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,423
representing,
and transmitting information and that 

316
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,680
you can,
you can,

317
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,320
you can,
uh,

318
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,253
incorporate the information without 
having any articulated notion of what 

319
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:39,764
you're doing.
So of course that's the case because 

320
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:43,484
otherwise you'd have to claim that you 
understand everything you do and can 

321
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,670
articulate it.
And it's like,

322
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,230
that's just,
you just,

323
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,370
that's just wrong.

324
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,580
You know,
you have a theory of yourself,

325
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:53,414
but it's not a very accurate theory,
which is why you're always doing things 

326
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:58,120
that are strange as far as your 
concerned,

327
00:16:58,121 --> 00:17:00,110
which is also extremely bizarre.
It's like,

328
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,890
who the hell are you if you can't even 
control your own behavior,

329
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,100
you know,
and,

330
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,510
and what does it mean to control it and 
what does it mean to not control it?

331
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,870
These are very,
very complex and strange issues.

332
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,330
So,
all right.

333
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:15,164
So I think,
I think the best way into this is 

334
00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:19,820
actually from an evolutionary 
perspective.

335
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:24,860
And I'm not,
I'm not convinced that this is correct,

336
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:26,810
but I think,
I think there's something to it.

337
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:32,260
So
when you,

338
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,620
when you think about the nature of 
experience then you think,

339
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:37,280
well,
the,

340
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,113
the nature of experience is quite 
different for quite different for 

341
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:40,754
different sorts of creatures.
And one of the primary difference 

342
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,290
between creatures is the degree to which
they're capable of social interaction.

343
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:53,290
And then of complex social interaction 
and primates generally speaking,

344
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:58,311
are very social creatures.
They live in troops or packs like dogs,

345
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:00,743
which is why we can get along with dogs 
because we understand each other being 

346
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:04,104
hierarchical troop animals.
We understand dogs and they understand 

347
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:08,700
us and they can fit right in pretty 
much.

348
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,350
And uh,
we're very,

349
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:15,810
very good at figuring out where we are 
in the truth.

350
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,050
And by we,
I mean primates,

351
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,870
I mean us going back a very,
very long period of time.

352
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,253
You know,
monkeys and chimpanzees have very 

353
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:27,920
sophisticated knowledge of the social 
structure surrounding them.

354
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,230
They know who's who and they know what 
status they are,

355
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:33,000
they know what rank they are 
essentially.

356
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,673
And that's also the case with people.
And so one of the things that you might 

357
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:43,320
say about people is that our reality 
isn't nature.

358
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,510
Exactly.
It's culture.

359
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,483
Now you can make the argument that you 
can't really distinguish nature from 

360
00:18:49,951 --> 00:18:50,410
culture.

361
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,780
And I,
I believe that

362
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,090
that's true and untrue in a sense.
You,

363
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:01,310
I think you can talk about the human and
nonhuman elements of reality and you can

364
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,320
identify the human elements of reality 
as culture,

365
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,810
even though culture is so old that you 
can also think about it as an inevitable

366
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:12,550
part of nature.
So anyway,

367
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:17,551
so most of our experience in our 
evolutionary past,

368
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,043
at least,
let's say for the last several million 

369
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,043
years,
we might as well go back to when the 

370
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:24,624
ancestors of humans hypothetically
split off from the ancestors of 

371
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,020
chimpanzees.
You know,

372
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:31,854
and,
and people know very accurately when 

373
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:35,064
these sorts of splits occur by the way,
because what they do is they have some 

374
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,470
sense of the rate of transformation of 
DNA.

375
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,491
You know,
it's like,

376
00:19:41,491 --> 00:19:41,960
uh,
it,

377
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,940
it transforms at a rate that's fairly 
constant across time.

378
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:45,774
And so then if you take two creatures 
and you determine how much genetic 

379
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:50,184
similarity there is between them and how
much difference you can calculate how 

380
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:54,540
far back they,
they,

381
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,890
uh,
diverged.

382
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,330
And so,
you know,

383
00:19:57,331 --> 00:20:00,000
the fossil record helps with that,
although it's very sparse.

384
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:00,834
But the DNA record,
it's not really sparse at all in some 

385
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:05,190
sense.
And so you can be very accurate about,

386
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,720
we can even tell when people evolved to 
clerk or learn to wear clothing.

387
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,213
And the reason we can tell that is 
because there are certain kinds of 

388
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:13,674
lights that can only live on clothing 
and they seem to have diverged from the 

389
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:20,340
lice that live in hair about 50,000 
years ago,

390
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:23,190
something like that.
And so the hypothesis is,

391
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:24,024
well we must be figuring out how to wear
clothes at that point because the lice 

392
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:28,870
figured out of the live in it.
So you know,

393
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:31,770
it probably took them a little while,
but I doubt if it took very long,

394
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,170
you know,
those little little creatures that breed

395
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:34,831
fast,
man,

396
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:38,130
those things can evolve quickly much to 
our dismay.

397
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,863
So okay,
so a big part of the experiential field 

398
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,330
of advanced primates is the social 
world.

399
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,093
And so we could that the primate world.
And then we could also say that another 

400
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:53,200
big part of their experience is the non 
primate world,

401
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,290
which would be roughly speaking the 
natural world.

402
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:59,320
And then we could also say that the 
other element of their experience,

403
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,513
the other elements of their experience 
that are very constant is their 

404
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:04,894
subjective being.
And we don't know much about the 

405
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:10,930
subjective being of of creatures like 
chimpanzees.

406
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:13,660
Although
you can,

407
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,673
you can understand,
I think this objective being of a dog 

408
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:21,880
well enough to be friend the dog.
And so you have some insight and I think

409
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:22,714
it's also reasonable to assume that,
I mean for a long time people were 

410
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:29,020
unwilling to admit that animals while 
had a soul,

411
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,070
that was the first problem.

412
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,903
But after that that they were conscious 
and even the behavior is fought that 

413
00:21:34,271 --> 00:21:35,104
notion.
But I think the simplest thing to do is 

414
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:40,390
to assume that animals and human beings 
are the same,

415
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:41,224
except when you can prove that they're 
are different because we share so much 

416
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:47,080
of our evolutionary paths.
But the logical inference is that if you

417
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:47,914
think a dog is doing something that's 
sort of like you would do in that 

418
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:50,554
situation and feeling that way,
it probably is with certain exceptions 

419
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:56,860
for species difference.
And if that wasn't the case,

420
00:21:56,861 --> 00:22:00,760
I don't think that you could have a 
relationship with a dog or cat.

421
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,040
You can't have much of a relationship 
with a lizard.

422
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,810
Although there are lizards,
there are lizards,

423
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,500
a bearded dragons in particular that are
social.

424
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:09,334
They like to lay on top of each other 
and they hang around together and you 

425
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:13,810
can actually have more of a relationship
with them.

426
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,150
And apparently the same is true if you 
go on us.

427
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,120
So you can go quite a ways back in the 
evolutionary,

428
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,380
you know,
backwards in evolutionary time and still

429
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:24,214
have enough similarity between you and 
the creature that you're interacting 

430
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:27,334
with so that you can get a pretty good 
sense of at least some element of their 

431
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,270
their being.
And so the idea that subjective,

432
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:38,380
our subjectivity is a very ancient part 
of our experience.

433
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:40,990
It seems to me to be a perfectly 
reasonable supposition.

434
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,183
We certainly know that it's been around 
in all likelihood for at least 150,000 

435
00:22:46,511 --> 00:22:47,344
years on the conservative side because 
there have been human beings that are 

436
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,513
essentially identical to us from a 
genetic perspective going back 150,000 

437
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:56,674
years.
But I think you'd have to be a pretty 

438
00:22:58,631 --> 00:23:01,900
harsh judge to assume that higher order 
primates,

439
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:06,850
like chimps don't have some 
consciousness and you know,

440
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,850
and,
and some limited self consciousness.

441
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,430
You know,
if you market chimps knows with lipstick

442
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:13,264
and then show it a mirror,
it will at least sometimes take the 

443
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:17,644
lipstick off its nose.
Although I've seen a gorilla try to 

444
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:21,310
fight with a mirror,
which,

445
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,650
well not,
I haven't personally seen that,

446
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,360
but I've seen a very good video of that 
happening.

447
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:30,520
But I think the gorilla and it would 
eventually figure out that it was,

448
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,930
that was him in the mirror.
Um,

449
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,353
dogs will recognize a dog in the mirror,
but they seem to learn to ignore their 

450
00:23:38,771 --> 00:23:40,360
reflection very,
very rapidly.

451
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:41,194
And I don't know if that means that they
have a rudimentary self consciousness 

452
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:46,640
and they,
they figure out that that dog is them.

453
00:23:46,641 --> 00:23:47,474
Or if the dog just doesn't smell like a 
dog and then the dog thinks while it 

454
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:52,514
can't be a dog because it doesn't smell 
like a dog and the dog's probably think 

455
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:55,724
that something is a dog because of how 
it smells and not because of how it 

456
00:23:58,671 --> 00:23:59,900
looks,
you know?

457
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,310
So that's why I think that's why dogs 
don't seem to have any sense of relative

458
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:06,530
size because you can get a chimp,
you know,

459
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:09,500
a little Chihuahua barking,
like mad at a great Dane.

460
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:11,180
You think really,
you know,

461
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,370
it's like that's,
that's going to work is it?

462
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,280
The dog doesn't seem to have a clue 
about that.

463
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:20,750
Like he's perfectly happy and great day 
and weirdly enough we'll often back off.

464
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,750
So anyways,
okay.

465
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,600
So
we've been in the social world at deeply

466
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:30,434
social world for a long time and I'm 
also going to make the presupposition 

467
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:36,810
that we'd been in the stratified social 
world for a very long period of time.

468
00:24:36,811 --> 00:24:39,920
And I think that you could call that if 
you wanted to.

469
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:41,780
And I would never want to,
by the way,

470
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:44,330
you could call that the patriarchy.
Um,

471
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,973
I think that,
I wouldn't call it that because that's 

472
00:24:48,741 --> 00:24:49,670
not what it is.

473
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,893
But I think that the fact that it's 
called that and that that's accepted as 

474
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:57,704
a reasonable representation is actually 
a consequence of the action of an 

475
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,624
archetype.
And the archetype is that it's the 

476
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:08,210
archetype of the terrible great father 
actually,

477
00:25:08,211 --> 00:25:12,170
because you think there's a social 
structure with striations in it and that

478
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:15,590
has advantages and disadvantages and the
advantages are you can live in it.

479
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,090
And the disadvantages are you have to 
follow the damn rules and they might not

480
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,640
necessarily be to your individual 
benefits.

481
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:27,440
So within a social dominance hierarchy 
is always a bifurcated.

482
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:31,430
It also always has bifurcated 
significance.

483
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,910
It can be good and he is good in so far 
as it protects you from say,

484
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,880
from threat,
from without,

485
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:38,810
you know,
maybe from,

486
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,000
from other primates invading your 
territory,

487
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:41,834
for example.
But it's also can be a very dismal 

488
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:46,850
structure for if you happen to be at the
bottom of the hierarchy.

489
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,880
So,
so anyways,

490
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,953
as far as I can tell
that dominant structures typically 

491
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:01,460
represented as masculine.
And I think the reason for that,

492
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,590
although I'm not absolutely certain of 
this,

493
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,293
I think the reason for that is that our 
social hierarchies are probably more 

494
00:26:07,821 --> 00:26:08,654
like chimps,
social hierarchies then they are like 

495
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,873
honorable social hierarchy.
So the Bonobos are kind of a strange 

496
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:14,714
breed of chimps.
I don't know how many of you know about 

497
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:16,874
them,
but the Bonobos are extraordinarily 

498
00:26:19,731 --> 00:26:20,564
sexual and they use sex pretty much as a
standard means of communication and 

499
00:26:25,621 --> 00:26:27,720
tension reduction.
And um,

500
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,120
there's a lot of sex between the females
learnable troops and they,

501
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:34,223
the use of sex seems to bond them 
together in a way that keeps male 

502
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:39,230
aggression under control,
which is quite interesting.

503
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,600
And so,
but in the chimps,

504
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:42,434
the fundamental hierarchy is male,
although there's a female dominance 

505
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:47,280
hierarchy as well.

506
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,000
And some females can certainly be more 
dominant than some males,

507
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,190
but the fundamental structure seems to 
be male.

508
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,473
And then I would also say,
well it's probably dependent to some 

509
00:26:57,391 --> 00:27:02,391
degree in the primate community and in 
other social animals on other factors.

510
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:04,620
So we know,
for example,

511
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:06,720
that the,
uh,

512
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,733
the gender that has the highest level of
testosterone tends to be the dominant 

513
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:13,230
gender.
And so in hyenas,

514
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,380
the females have larger,
have higher levels of testosterone.

515
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:17,214
There are actually bigger and more 
aggressive than the males in the price 

516
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:19,854
they pay for.
That is that they have to give birth 

517
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:23,640
through structured.
That's very much like a penis,

518
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,474
which is not the world's most pleasant 
experience and might account for the 

519
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:29,670
hyenas temper.
So,

520
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,920
but in,
in human beings,

521
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:32,911
you know,
you,

522
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:36,240
you see sexual dimorphism men are 
slightly bigger than women.

523
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,180
And that's also generally characteristic
of,

524
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,073
of creatures that have a dominance 
hierarchy that's tilted towards 

525
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,453
masculine.

526
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,560
And then the other factor seems to be 
that

527
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,440
human beings have their be,
their infants are infants have very,

528
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:53,161
very,
very,

529
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:55,740
very,
very long periods of dependence.

530
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:01,160
And it's very difficult to maneuver your
way doing anything really,

531
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:06,480
especially anything that has to do with 
competition and power.

532
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,420
If you're taking care of,
you know,

533
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,000
one infant,
let alone three.

534
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,720
And so it seems to me
that those are all valid reasons why the

535
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:21,864
primary power structures among human 
beings have typically be male and why 

536
00:28:25,261 --> 00:28:26,094
they're represented as masculine.
Now I thought there are other reasons 

537
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,530
too,
cause this is a multifaceted phenomenon.

538
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,873
I mean one of the things that's very 
interesting about human females is that 

539
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,673
they're selective maters.
Now chimp females are not selective 

540
00:28:40,861 --> 00:28:41,694
majors and what that means is that the 
dominant males still have most of the 

541
00:28:44,341 --> 00:28:45,174
offspring.
But the reason for that apparently is 

542
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,360
because they chase the subordinate males
away from sexually receptive females.

543
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,493
Although this sexually receptive females
will sneak off behind a rock somewhere 

544
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,393
and mate with a subordinate male,
but as long as the dominant male is 

545
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:02,124
around,
the probability of that is quite low so 

546
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:06,120
that the female chimps aren't sexually 
selective.

547
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,373
Whereas human females have concealed 
ovulation so that no one knows when 

548
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:13,500
they're at their most fertile and 
they're selective maters.

549
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:14,603
And women in every society virtually 
that's ever been studied have a typical 

550
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,833
pattern of behavior,
which is that if you look at a female 

551
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:23,940
dominance hierarchy and you look at the 
male dominance hierarchy,

552
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:28,590
the females will mate across and up 
dominance hierarchies and the males will

553
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:29,424
mate across and down,
which works fine both genders because 

554
00:29:32,551 --> 00:29:35,130
their interests align.
But uh,

555
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:41,210
but it also means that in all likelihood
that women had exerted tremendous sexual

556
00:29:41,681 --> 00:29:45,130
selection pressure on men.
And that might be part of the reason,

557
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,230
many of the many reasons that we 
actually,

558
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,831
you know,
the,

559
00:29:47,831 --> 00:29:48,664
the theory is,
is that the common ancestor between 

560
00:29:50,651 --> 00:29:52,570
chimps and humans was a lot more like a 
champ,

561
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,490
a modern champ,
then like a modern human.

562
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:55,893
So for whatever reason,
we've undergone a lot more 

563
00:29:57,821 --> 00:30:00,820
transformation in the last 7 million 
years then chimps have.

564
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,910
And one,
one possible reason for that,

565
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:05,590
and I think it's a highly probable 
reason,

566
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:09,220
is that sexual selection operated lot 
more viciously,

567
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,810
so to speak,
among humans.

568
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,913
It's operated to the point where you 
have twice as many female ancestors as 

569
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:18,130
male,
and you might think,

570
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:19,390
well,
that can't be possible,

571
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:20,224
but here's how it's possible.
It's only every second Manhattan 

572
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,240
children at Agile,
well,

573
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:28,000
all women had one.
Now of course that isn't what happened,

574
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,860
but on average,
that's what happened.

575
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:30,723
So the proportion of men who are 
completely childless in any given 

576
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:38,530
generation is far higher than the 
proportion of women who are.

577
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,873
So you,
you see an element of expandability in 

578
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:45,400
males,
and that's typical across the biological

579
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:46,234
community because you don't need as many
males as you need females in order to 

580
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:50,530
keep the population moving forward.

581
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,933
Um,
and one of the things that happens as a 

582
00:30:53,411 --> 00:30:55,240
consequence of that,
at least in principle,

583
00:30:55,241 --> 00:30:56,074
is that males are more behaviorally 
variable and variable across a lot of 

584
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:00,814
dimensions than females are.
And that's a plus because they're more 

585
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:06,430
variable on the upside,
but it's also a negative because they're

586
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,264
more prevalent on the downside.
So now there's substantial argument 

587
00:31:10,421 --> 00:31:12,700
about that in relationship to people.
You know,

588
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:16,540
what the actual implications are of that
for human beings.

589
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,623
Um,
one potential implication is that 

590
00:31:19,871 --> 00:31:24,871
although women and men have equivalent 
Iq is the standard deviation is slightly

591
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,134
different,
which means that there are more males 

592
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:32,110
who are intellectually impaired,
but they're also more males who are four

593
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:34,570
and five standard deviations above the 
population.

594
00:31:34,571 --> 00:31:36,710
Me,
you don't need much of a difference in,

595
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,623
in standard deviation in order to 
produce radical differences at the 

596
00:31:41,111 --> 00:31:42,970
extreme.
So for example,

597
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,440
I'll give you,
I'll give you an example,

598
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,100
males are more aggressive than females 
among humans,

599
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,090
but the effect is only about half a 
standard deviation.

600
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:57,010
And so what that means is that if you 
take two females,

601
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,860
a female and a male random lead from a 
population,

602
00:31:59,861 --> 00:32:03,070
and you were trying to guess who was the
more aggressive of the two,

603
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,940
most of the time,
you know,

604
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:09,760
about 60% of the time the male would be 
more aggressive than the female,

605
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,740
but 40% of the time it would be 
reversed.

606
00:32:11,741 --> 00:32:12,191
So,
you know,

607
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:13,750
that's,
that's a lot of overlap.

608
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:18,751
But then here's the rub.
So let's say just for example,

609
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:22,150
that among the population of men and 
women combined,

610
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:27,220
only the most aggressive person out of a
hundred ends up in jail.

611
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:28,953
Those are all men because that tilt 
towards aggression is enough so that if 

612
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:35,140
you go way,
way out on the distribution,

613
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,170
the only people who are that extreme,
our men,

614
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,340
even though the population isn't that 
great.

615
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,820
So anyways,
there's a massive debate in the,

616
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,003
um,
relevant literature about the potential 

617
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:48,254
consequences of that for things like 
cognitive function because there's some 

618
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:54,400
indication as well that men are more 
cognitively specialized,

619
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,540
but women are more cognitively robust.

620
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,750
And so anyways,
it doesn't really matter.

621
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,973
But what does matter,
what does matter is the fact of this 

622
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,303
permanent dominance hierarchy.
Now the dominance hierarchy also has 

623
00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:07,214
another,
the male dominance hierarchy also has 

624
00:33:09,051 --> 00:33:11,750
another feature.
So we already said that,

625
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,973
you know,
on average men are half as likely to 

626
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,034
leave offspring as women are.
And so what that means is that all 

627
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:21,120
things considered,
uh,

628
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,893
this isn't,
I'm not trying to make this into a 

629
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,183
circular argument because I could say 
it's the more successful males that 

630
00:33:30,681 --> 00:33:32,360
leave offspring.
But then you'd say,

631
00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:35,030
well that's a definition,
Darwinian definition of success.

632
00:33:35,031 --> 00:33:37,430
But I'm not,
I don't mean Darwinian success.

633
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,123
Cause that's self evident.
What I mean is that if you look in the 

634
00:33:41,031 --> 00:33:41,864
modern world for example,
and you try to predict number of 

635
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:48,500
available sexual partners for given 
mail,

636
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:52,700
your best predictive measure of that is 
income.

637
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,960
And the best predictive measure of that 
is intelligence and conscientiousness.

638
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:58,483
And so what happens is that males orient
themselves in groups and then they 

639
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:07,580
compete and then women peel off the top.
And so,

640
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:11,630
and so the women are in a position of 
judgment on men.

641
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,600
And the judgment is the judgment of 
nature.

642
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,540
Now,
from a Darwinian perspective,

643
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,670
you know,
when we think of nature,

644
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:22,160
we think of like a friend.
It depends on who you are.

645
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:22,994
But like if you're an environmentalist,
you think of a French impressionists 

646
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,940
landscape,
you know,

647
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,523
forgetting that nature is also malarial 
mosquitoes and cancer and all those and 

648
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:31,634
you know,
rats infected with bubonic plague and 

649
00:34:32,961 --> 00:34:35,300
all those other lovely things.
Um,

650
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,183
but from a Darwinian perspective,
you can define nature much more 

651
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:45,150
straightforwardly and more accurately as
that which selects now,

652
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,543
you know,
you hear a lot about natural selection 

653
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,573
and natural selection basically assumes 
that there are a random distribution of 

654
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:58,520
alterations in genetic structure in any,
in any population,

655
00:34:58,521 --> 00:34:59,600
in any generation.

656
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,033
And some of those random alterations 
will be more suited to that particular 

657
00:35:04,701 --> 00:35:08,420
environment suited being they'll live 
and they'll reproduce.

658
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,613
And genetic transformation takes place 
across the millennia as the organism 

659
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,530
chases the landscape,
roughly speaking.

660
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,790
But Darwin,
you know,

661
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,910
Darwin who is an unbelievably 
intelligent person,

662
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,840
was also very,
very interested in sexual selection.

663
00:35:26,841 --> 00:35:27,674
And as far as Darwin was concerned,
sexual selection was just as powerful a 

664
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:34,250
force in modifying genetic structure,
modifying them,

665
00:35:34,251 --> 00:35:38,220
driving evolution as um,
natural selection.

666
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,430
And that's the way have been very 
underplayed by biologists.

667
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,100
And that's the only started to switch 
maybe in the last,

668
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,890
I would say it hasn't switched that much
yet,

669
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,000
but it only really started to switch 
probably in about the last 25 years.

670
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,163
And that's because the idea of sexual 
selection makes things a hell of a lot 

671
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:57,050
more complicated.
You know,

672
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,790
because,
well,

673
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,860
first of all,
you know,

674
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:04,230
in the standard Darwinian account of 
evolution,

675
00:36:04,231 --> 00:36:05,820
there's no place for mind,
right?

676
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,020
There's no place for a creator.
There's no place for teleology.

677
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,330
And teleology is something moving 
towards an end goal.

678
00:36:12,331 --> 00:36:17,010
Right?
But your thing is if sexual selection is

679
00:36:17,011 --> 00:36:17,844
operative and if consciousness is 
ancient than mine has been operating 

680
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:26,580
through sexual selection and as long as 
there's been sexual selection,

681
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,140
I mean,
so you think,

682
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,900
you think,
do you have any choice?

683
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:34,860
Do you make any choice in who your 
partner will be?

684
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,070
A sexual partner will be an answer to 
that as well.

685
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:41,040
It's hardly random.
You make a choice.

686
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,840
And what's interesting is that,
you know,

687
00:36:42,841 --> 00:36:43,674
if you take 60 people,
let's say if you took 60 women and you 

688
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:46,914
ask them,
you showed them a bunch of man and you 

689
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:50,550
asked them to rank them in terms of 
their attractiveness,

690
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,890
there's going to be fairly consistent 
rankings.

691
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:53,761
You know,
I mean,

692
00:36:53,761 --> 00:36:58,200
we know what makes up attractive facial 
features for women and for men you,

693
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,490
it's easy to determine that.

694
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:02,610
What you do is you take 60 faces and 
you,

695
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:03,623
you average the features so you don't 
get the average person because the 

696
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:08,394
average person is more like immediate.
You get the average person and the 

697
00:37:12,391 --> 00:37:13,224
average person has perfectly symmetrical
features that are nicely shaped and 

698
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,610
fairly big eyes.
And,

699
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,290
and,
and they're,

700
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:19,921
they're very,
you know,

701
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:21,990
they're very nice looking.
They're very attractive.

702
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,243
And so that means that there's like a 
central human form in the sense that 

703
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,163
we're,
we find attractive and we see this in 

704
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,770
other species.
For example,

705
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:34,860
there are butterflies who won't mate 
with another butterfly if it's,

706
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,993
if it's like a 16th of an inch out of 
symmetry because then it's not a 

707
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:41,370
butterfly of that type.
You know?

708
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,420
And that's how people think too,
is the more you deviate from the average

709
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:46,703
person,
the less canonically human you appear 

710
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,660
and the less attractive that you appear.

711
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,351
And so,
you know,

712
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:53,184
we're chasing this ideal in some sense.
That's an emergent property of the 

713
00:37:56,071 --> 00:37:58,320
nature of our species.
And then,

714
00:37:59,100 --> 00:37:59,933
you know,
there are certain physical 

715
00:38:00,961 --> 00:38:02,560
characteristics,
um,

716
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:05,730
wide shoulders in men and narrow waist 
and women.

717
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:06,564
It's waist to hip ratio is a very common
marker of beauty across cultures and 

718
00:38:10,261 --> 00:38:12,240
across body types.
Interestingly enough.

719
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:13,074
So
if you take federal women and heavier 

720
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:16,494
women and you get men to rate the 
attractiveness of the women within that 

721
00:38:20,011 --> 00:38:20,844
category,
the heavy women and the light women who 

722
00:38:22,471 --> 00:38:23,304
have a hip waist to hip ratio of about 
0.68 are the ones that are judged most 

723
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:26,874
attractive physically and so,
and that actually correlates by the way 

724
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:31,254
with fertility because this abdominal 
fat in a young woman is a sign of ill 

725
00:38:35,201 --> 00:38:38,470
health and also a mark or a decreased 
likelihood of conception.

726
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,900
Now none of this is operating co 
consciously,

727
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,420
obviously it's,
it's deeply wired into us.

728
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:48,421
It's part of our immediate perception.
But it still does indicate that there is

729
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:49,834
an ideal,
like a platonic ideal lurking at the 

730
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:56,140
back of our minds against whom we 
compare everyone that we meet.

731
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,660
And then you might say,
well what's the nature of that plot?

732
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:01,570
Platonic ideal?
And that's a very,

733
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:03,790
very complicated question.
You know,

734
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,610
I would say that I would say that you 
could,

735
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,400
you could almost literally claim that

736
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,673
the,

737
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:17,530
well you can certainly claim that the 
ideal male is represented mythology as a

738
00:39:19,521 --> 00:39:22,370
hero.
So,

739
00:39:22,371 --> 00:39:24,140
and that's actually what mythologies 
about.

740
00:39:24,141 --> 00:39:26,540
It's about representing ideal patterns 
of behavior.

741
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:29,000
So it's hardly surprising.
And so you know,

742
00:39:29,001 --> 00:39:34,001
if you go to a movie and it's a romance 
and there's the main lead character that

743
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,443
you're supposed to fall in love with,
if you happen to be the kind of person 

744
00:39:38,091 --> 00:39:39,950
that would fall in love with that kind 
of person,

745
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:45,370
then he's going to act out of particular
a particular pattern of behavior and the

746
00:39:46,161 --> 00:39:48,230
pattern of behavior is quite 
identifiable.

747
00:39:48,231 --> 00:39:49,640
So for example,
he's going to be,

748
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:53,000
he's going to move forward and explore 
and not hide in cower.

749
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,253
And the probability that is going to be 
creative is very high and the 

750
00:39:56,151 --> 00:39:58,480
probability that he's going to be good 
looking and strong,

751
00:39:58,481 --> 00:39:59,314
it's very high.
And so those are architectural features 

752
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:07,040
and those aren't all the architectural 
features because those are in some sense

753
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:10,970
those are the,
those are the self evident once.

754
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,193
But you know,
people are also evaluating each other 

755
00:40:13,941 --> 00:40:17,240
for such things as intelligence and 
personality and character.

756
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:18,903
And

757
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,673
you could say in some sense the men are 
competing to be the best man and the 

758
00:40:24,501 --> 00:40:25,334
women are watching the male competition 
to take the man who wins on the 

759
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:31,070
presupposition that he wouldn't win if 
he wasn't the best map.

760
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,410
It's a very,
very intelligent strategy,

761
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,513
you know,
because why not outsource the problem 

762
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:39,790
you let the men sorted out while exists 
to cognitive,

763
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,703
to cognitively complex to compute.
You could say that the male dominance 

764
00:40:43,611 --> 00:40:45,320
hierarchy is equivalent to the stock 
market.

765
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:46,993
It's exactly equivalent to the stock 
market is the mitten you'd like the 

766
00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:49,784
stocks or stocks are always competing 
with one another and with every other 

767
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:56,210
commodity for primacy of price and 
value.

768
00:40:56,211 --> 00:40:59,000
And that's exactly what happens with 
male competition.

769
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:02,870
So one of the things that we've just 
discovered in my lab,

770
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,060
this is Caitlin burtons work.
It's very cool.

771
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,283
We took a,
we were trying to understand the 

772
00:41:08,301 --> 00:41:12,860
fundamental substructure of conservatism
versus liberalism and we're,

773
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:16,580
and I'm going to speak in terms of 
conservatism because that's how we,

774
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,530
that's how we construed the data.

775
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:19,363
Although we could have done the reverse 
if we were going to construe liberalism 

776
00:41:21,141 --> 00:41:25,160
and what we did was we took,
we got a bunch of people to sit down and

777
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:25,994
write down statements.
They thought that conservatives versus 

778
00:41:28,221 --> 00:41:30,590
liberals would disagree with.
How do you know?

779
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,840
I think we had,
I don't remember how many statements,

780
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,733
300 something like that.
And we have a lot of people generate 

781
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:39,620
them and take them from news items and 
so forth because we didn't want any bias

782
00:41:39,621 --> 00:41:41,930
in the,
in the initial questions step,

783
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:43,460
you know,
and,

784
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:48,050
or we didn't want to buy us that wasn't 
there in the actual world.

785
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:52,520
So we have many people do this and then 
we gave these questions too many,

786
00:41:52,521 --> 00:41:56,090
many people online in a variety of 
stages.

787
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,193
And we,
we extracted those out that seemed to 

788
00:42:00,711 --> 00:42:04,310
best fit the data and that we're,
and then assess them for the utility and

789
00:42:04,311 --> 00:42:07,280
predicting things like party membership 
or voting behavior.

790
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,890
And so we got a good structure.
It makes a lot of sense.

791
00:42:09,891 --> 00:42:12,410
And what we found with regards to the 
conservatism was,

792
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,820
um,
there was an ethnocentrism factor.

793
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:17,654
It was the third week is factor.
And that would be associated with in 

794
00:42:20,091 --> 00:42:22,490
group preference versus outgroup 
derogation.

795
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,520
So those are anti-immigrant people 
fundamentally,

796
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:26,354
you know,
and they're,

797
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,150
they're leather ethnocentric.
That's,

798
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,760
that's,
that's the simplest way to,

799
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,810
that's the simplest way to explain it.
And then the next block that,

800
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,360
the second smallest factor was basically
religious traditionalism.

801
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:42,583
And so that,
and most of this was done with 

802
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:44,690
Americans,
you know,

803
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,160
for,
for a variety of reasons.

804
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,160
And that was really where the 
fundamentalist Christians nested,

805
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:49,970
you know,
and not,

806
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,140
not,
not everyone.

807
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,233
That was not only a factor,
that wasn't only a factor made up a 

808
00:42:55,851 --> 00:42:58,790
fundamentalist Christian beliefs,
but they loaded ha ha.

809
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,673
Heavily.
Those were people who weren't for stem 

810
00:43:01,551 --> 00:43:02,390
cell research.

811
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,940
They were antiabortion,
they were anti gay marriage.

812
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:08,390
Um,
or they were pro traditional,

813
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:13,600
which is how they see themselves.
And then the largest factor was what was

814
00:43:14,451 --> 00:43:17,990
a factor that we call masculine 
independence.

815
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:19,603
And it was more characteristic of men.
And what it basically consisted of was 

816
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:27,050
an attitude that winners win and losers 
lose.

817
00:43:27,051 --> 00:43:29,330
And that's just how it should be.
So there it was,

818
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:30,620
it was,
it was,

819
00:43:30,621 --> 00:43:33,260
uh,
the men who the personality predictors,

820
00:43:33,261 --> 00:43:35,960
one of them was extroverted 
assertiveness for example.

821
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,840
These were,
these are hunting and,

822
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:41,180
and the right to own firearms also 
loaded on this factor.

823
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:46,360
But it was like,
it was masculine competitiveness I think

824
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:49,160
is the best way of thinking about it.
And uh,

825
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,203
okay.

826
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,113
I think it's a good illustration of the 
kind of individual attitude that makes 

827
00:43:56,121 --> 00:43:56,954
you more likely to attempt to climb up 
dominance hierarchies and dominate them 

828
00:44:00,231 --> 00:44:01,640
from the top down.
You know?

829
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:02,474
And that's not necessarily something 
that would be associated with factors 

830
00:44:04,611 --> 00:44:06,830
like compassion.
So,

831
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,600
and then we,
well,

832
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:10,550
I'll leave it at that.
It's just,

833
00:44:10,551 --> 00:44:12,000
you can see,
I,

834
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:12,973
I'm telling you that because you can see
how these proclivities emerge and 

835
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:18,530
manifest themselves in all sorts of 
areas of behavior.

836
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,930
I can tell you something else that's 
very interesting about,

837
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:24,020
about men and violence.

838
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:25,753
MMM.

839
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,130
I don't know if I can the story straight
because

840
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,520
it's been a while since I told it.

841
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:39,683
Yeah.
So there's this interesting phenomenon 

842
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,020
that it's very characteristic of,
of,

843
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,063
of societies,
I believe pretty much everywhere it's 

844
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:49,644
being studied.
Now you can calculate an index called 

845
00:44:53,251 --> 00:44:54,084
the Gini Coefficient.
The Gini Coefficient is a number that 

846
00:44:57,151 --> 00:45:00,840
represents how much inequality of income
distribution.

847
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:01,674
There isn't a given geographical area.
So you could calculate a Gini 

848
00:45:04,531 --> 00:45:07,190
Coefficient for a street or uh,
you know,

849
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:08,383
um,
an area in a city or a city or a state 

850
00:45:10,321 --> 00:45:12,120
or a country.
You can do it at all those levels.

851
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,553
And,
uh,

852
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,390
what you find is,
you know,

853
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,480
you always hear this idea that poverty 
causes crime.

854
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:22,380
That's a classic left wing idea,
but it's wrong.

855
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:25,560
It's seriously wrong and it's 
importantly wrong.

856
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:29,130
And it's d definitively wrong.
Not only that,

857
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,490
so there's no argument about this.
It's already been established.

858
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,713
What causes crime?
Especially aggressive crime is relative 

859
00:45:35,971 --> 00:45:40,200
poverty and relative poverty is not the 
same thing as poverty at all.

860
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,470
It's seriously not the same thing.
Poverty is when you don't have enough to

861
00:45:43,471 --> 00:45:44,304
eat.
Relative poverty is when the guy next 

862
00:45:45,781 --> 00:45:48,720
door has a much better car than you.
So,

863
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,273
and there's lots of relative poverty in 
the United States and there's some 

864
00:45:52,471 --> 00:45:53,304
absolute poverty.
But even the absolute poverty in the 

865
00:45:55,351 --> 00:45:56,184
United States is nothing like the 
absolute poverty say in places like 

866
00:45:58,531 --> 00:46:03,090
India or in sub Saharan Africa where 
absolute poverty means you have nothing.

867
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:04,643
Now what's really interesting about the 
Gini Coefficient is that if you go to 

868
00:46:09,031 --> 00:46:11,550
places where everyone roughly speaking 
is,

869
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,370
is poor say by national standards.
Um,

870
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:16,283
I think South Dakota was often used as 
an example or maybe one of the maritime 

871
00:46:19,621 --> 00:46:22,500
provinces like Newfoundland,
where there's,

872
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:26,010
where there's low average income,
but it's pretty flat distribution.

873
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,653
There's almost no crime.
And if you go to places where the 

874
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:34,560
everyone's rich,
then there's almost no crime.

875
00:46:34,561 --> 00:46:35,394
But if you go places where there were 
poor people and moderately well off 

876
00:46:39,331 --> 00:46:43,470
people and rich people and the 
distribution is really steep,

877
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,333
then the rate of aggressive behavior 
among young men and it's usually within 

878
00:46:48,031 --> 00:46:50,060
their own ethnic group,
starts to spa,

879
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,870
skyrocketed out of control.

880
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:53,183
And the reason for that seems to be that
if the dominance hierarchy is too steep 

881
00:46:57,061 --> 00:46:57,894
than the young men have no likelihood of
climbing to a dominant position while 

882
00:47:02,281 --> 00:47:03,114
playing the standard social game.
And so what they do is turn to 

883
00:47:06,151 --> 00:47:07,470
aggression,
aggression to,

884
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:10,590
to make their mark on the world.
And it works too.

885
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,050
That's the other thing is that make no 
mistake about it.

886
00:47:13,051 --> 00:47:13,884
If you're,
if you're looking for status in a place 

887
00:47:15,451 --> 00:47:18,060
where status is hard to achieve and 
you're the meanest,

888
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:18,923
toughest guy around then and you know 
around a bunch of people who like you 

889
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:23,874
don't have much money,
then you're going to benefit from that 

890
00:47:25,861 --> 00:47:27,840
status if it works.
Yup.

891
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:32,930
Would that be a part of the reason why?
Cause I know the,

892
00:47:32,931 --> 00:47:36,460
I think the violent crime rate in the U 
S is higher than it is in Canada.

893
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,350
Would that be part of the reason that,
sure.

894
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,500
Okay.
Sure.

895
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,151
Yeah.
I mean,

896
00:47:40,151 --> 00:47:42,880
you can make a real conservative 
argument for making sure that,

897
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,273
you know,
the conservatives are very anti income 

898
00:47:46,061 --> 00:47:46,894
distribution and we figured that's 
because of the guys that have this male 

899
00:47:49,391 --> 00:47:50,710
independence,
you know,

900
00:47:50,711 --> 00:47:53,020
they identify with this male 
independence factor.

901
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,093
They don't want to be distributing 
resources to people who are down in the 

902
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:57,334
dominance hierarchy because they will,
they want them down in the dominance 

903
00:47:59,321 --> 00:48:00,154
hierarchy.
They want there to be a difference 

904
00:48:01,031 --> 00:48:04,720
between the people on talk and the 
people on the bottom so that they can be

905
00:48:04,721 --> 00:48:07,990
the people on talk so that it increases 
the relative attractiveness.

906
00:48:07,991 --> 00:48:08,824
Like it's a perfectly logical game and 
they presume that while the rules are 

907
00:48:12,551 --> 00:48:13,384
set up and like every man can go for it,
do as fast in the winner wins and the 

908
00:48:17,141 --> 00:48:17,800
loser loses.

909
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,633
And that's just how it is.
And don't ask me to fix it because I 

910
00:48:21,221 --> 00:48:22,380
don't want to,
you know,

911
00:48:22,381 --> 00:48:23,800
and it'd,
besides that it's,

912
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:24,933
I don't find it,
I find it distasteful to attempt to fix 

913
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:28,600
it more than that.
Right.

914
00:48:28,601 --> 00:48:31,960
Because it's a moral issue.
It's not just an intellectual issue.

915
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:34,660
So,
so you,

916
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:35,643
you can make a case,
however you can make a case from the 

917
00:48:37,961 --> 00:48:38,794
conservative point of view,
especially with regards to say beliefs 

918
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:45,730
and religious traditionalism and the 
desire to maintain social stability that

919
00:48:45,731 --> 00:48:49,270
you shouldn't let income distribution 
become two unequal.

920
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:50,223
Like one of the big things your society 
has to do is to make sure that that 

921
00:48:53,261 --> 00:48:55,810
doesn't get out of hand because it tends
to get out of hand.

922
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:56,644
It tends towards a few people having 
everything and almost everyone else 

923
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:02,050
having nothing.
It's a natural in a sense,

924
00:49:02,051 --> 00:49:05,650
it's a natural consequence of economic 
progression,

925
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,570
which is actually something that marks 
pointed out,

926
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:11,770
although an Italian named Burrito and 
figured it out at approximately the same

927
00:49:11,771 --> 00:49:12,604
time.
And I think with a lot more conceptual 

928
00:49:14,471 --> 00:49:15,304
clarity,
but the more unequal you let your 

929
00:49:18,011 --> 00:49:21,010
society get,
the higher the probability of of death,

930
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:23,260
roughly speaking through through violent
causes.

931
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:25,030
And you know,
um,

932
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:29,500
but,
but what I'm telling you why it is that,

933
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:30,363
you know,
men want to climb the dominant Turk and 

934
00:49:32,141 --> 00:49:34,330
the reason they want to call them the 
dominance hierarchies because that's how

935
00:49:34,331 --> 00:49:35,350
they get access to women,

936
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,013
um,
familiar and yet familiar and the 

937
00:49:44,451 --> 00:49:45,460
structure.
Um,

938
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,560
so it seems like we all want it within 
the structure,

939
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:50,820
but we don't want the rule to apply to 
ourselves.

940
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:52,651
Well,
we,

941
00:49:52,651 --> 00:49:53,484
we have this contradictory problem.
We want to be protected by the 

942
00:49:55,961 --> 00:49:56,794
structure,
but we want to advance our position 

943
00:49:57,881 --> 00:50:01,870
within it.
And so that means what that should mean.

944
00:50:01,871 --> 00:50:02,704
And this is,
I think the definition of civilized 

945
00:50:04,721 --> 00:50:05,554
behavior is that you're allowed to 
advance your position within the 

946
00:50:08,351 --> 00:50:11,260
structure as long as you don't disrupt 
it negatively.

947
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,710
You know,
and I think most people do do that.

948
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,410
In fact,
I think people in,

949
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,433
in civilized countries do that so 
effectively that it's an absolutely 

950
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:21,693
incomprehensible miracle.
I can't understand how or why it ever 

951
00:50:25,571 --> 00:50:28,310
got established.
But a psychopath will,

952
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:31,700
he climbed the ladder and cut the rungs 
off underneath them fundamentally.

953
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:32,930
Right?
It's like he doesn't care.

954
00:50:32,931 --> 00:50:35,060
He doesn't even care if the damn thing 
maintains itself.

955
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,473
You know,
he's perfectly willing to have it 

956
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:40,480
destroyed after he's exhausted it,
you know?

957
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:41,323
But if everyone acted like that,
or even if a fairly substantial 

958
00:50:44,031 --> 00:50:47,720
percentage of people acted like that,
the whole thing would come to a halt.

959
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:51,410
Virtually like in no time flat.
So,

960
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,820
so mean.

961
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:59,000
Why
c you might hear,

962
00:50:59,001 --> 00:51:01,340
here's the reason likely,
you know,

963
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:04,790
cause one of the things we were talking 
about was masculine violence.

964
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,870
Now the thing about masculine violence 
is it only tends to emerge in situations

965
00:51:08,871 --> 00:51:09,704
where there does,
there don't seem to be any other 

966
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:16,550
reasonably viable means of advancing 
status.

967
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:19,490
So it's not reasonable to say that men 
are aggressive.

968
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,730
You can say that on average men are more
aggressive than women.

969
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:28,130
And you can also say that if that,
if you put men in a situation where they

970
00:51:28,131 --> 00:51:31,880
have no,
where they can see status differences,

971
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:34,940
but they have no means of moving 
forward,

972
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,673
that they're likely to turn to 
aggression as a way of establishing 

973
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:40,873
dominance.
And then you can say that that's the 

974
00:51:42,471 --> 00:51:44,690
reason for that is because it makes them
more attractive.

975
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,640
What the fundamental reason

976
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:52,930
I read this article was about how a 
polygamous societies are more Marlin.

977
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:54,640
Yeah,
absolutely.

978
00:51:55,950 --> 00:52:00,800
Like when one guy has two wives,
I mean 50% of the population.

979
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,130
That's right.
Yeah.

980
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:04,760
And that's exactly right that the,
the,

981
00:52:04,761 --> 00:52:05,594
the,
the evolutionary psychology explanation 

982
00:52:07,441 --> 00:52:10,980
for the pathology of polygamy is that if
once you let it establish itself,

983
00:52:10,981 --> 00:52:12,280
then the men get ultraviolet.

984
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,170
So,
so would you say that

985
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:18,803
many people have said that and yes.
I think you can make a strong case for 

986
00:52:21,961 --> 00:52:22,794
that.
And I think the fundamental reason is 

987
00:52:23,791 --> 00:52:25,860
the one that you just pointed out,
you know,

988
00:52:25,861 --> 00:52:27,720
the idea is,
well,

989
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:31,440
would you rather have one woman
or die,

990
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:35,130
you know,
or sorry,

991
00:52:35,131 --> 00:52:36,680
that's not quite right.
Would you rather no,

992
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:39,070
that's not quite,
that's not quite right would you,

993
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:39,933
it's more like would you be willing to 
limit yourself to one partner or have a 

994
00:52:43,921 --> 00:52:47,090
shot at many partners but a much higher 
probability of dying.

995
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,680
Right.
And you know,

996
00:52:49,681 --> 00:52:53,580
some guys will take that,
they'll take the high risk approach,

997
00:52:53,581 --> 00:52:54,414
you know,
so now if this doesn't eliminate the 

998
00:52:56,851 --> 00:52:57,684
difference in individual differences in 
determining who is going to be 

999
00:53:00,781 --> 00:53:01,614
aggressive,
because what'll happen is that as the 

1000
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:08,130
Gini Coefficient pressure rises,
the more aggressive men,

1001
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:11,850
the men who are more aggressive by 
nature will get more aggressive first.

1002
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:12,803
Right?
So you could imagine there is a 

1003
00:53:13,351 --> 00:53:15,750
threshold phenomenon in some sense.
So,

1004
00:53:15,751 --> 00:53:16,584
and I don't,
I should tell you as well is the 

1005
00:53:17,851 --> 00:53:18,684
relationship between the Gini 
Coefficient and male on male homicide 

1006
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,673
isn't like 0.2 or 0.3 which is about the
correlation that you'd get if you were 

1007
00:53:26,941 --> 00:53:29,490
predicting something like that.
Using personality.

1008
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:33,210
It's like 0.8 or 0.9 it's like it eats 
up all of it.

1009
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:37,590
It's the explanation.
So it's a huge effect.

1010
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:38,371
You know,
it's so,

1011
00:53:38,371 --> 00:53:40,290
it's so big and effected.
You could basically say,

1012
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:41,430
oh,
well we figured that out.

1013
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:44,550
Although psychologists never know when 
they figured anything out in.

1014
00:53:44,551 --> 00:53:48,420
They keep endlessly retesting it over 
and over and over because you know,

1015
00:53:48,421 --> 00:53:50,280
we don't know how to bring our science 
to a store,

1016
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,330
but if you don't accept the Gini 
Coefficient aggression down,

1017
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:55,164
it's like you might as well throw the 
rest of social sciences out the window 

1018
00:53:56,941 --> 00:54:01,050
because the effect is unbelievably 
powerful.

1019
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:03,620
What you go play areas take place.

1020
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:06,860
It depends.
You can do it at any level of analysis.

1021
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,350
You can do it,
you can do it by county,

1022
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:12,650
you can do it by city,
you can do it by state and you can do it

1023
00:54:12,651 --> 00:54:15,110
by country and it works on all of those 
levels.

1024
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:18,260
Predicted aggression,
you bet.

1025
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,611
Yup.
Yeah,

1026
00:54:19,611 --> 00:54:20,444
and that's a great question.
I mean the methodologically 

1027
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:27,430
sophisticated studies have done exactly 
that to ensure that while to ensure that

1028
00:54:27,891 --> 00:54:31,520
it's actually this phenomena rather than
other factors that might be operative in

1029
00:54:31,521 --> 00:54:32,354
that particular geographical area.
So countries with a higher gr Gini 

1030
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:37,183
Coefficient or more violent and cities 
within that country that have a higher 

1031
00:54:39,561 --> 00:54:42,950
than average Gini Coefficient for that 
country are more violent on average.

1032
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,050
It's a very,
very robust,

1033
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:46,880
robust,
robust finding.

1034
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,610
So,
all right,

1035
00:54:49,611 --> 00:54:51,850
so
we're good.

1036
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,753
We're going to say for the sake of 
argument that you've got the male 

1037
00:54:56,211 --> 00:54:59,810
dominance hierarchy and it's represented
as masculine.

1038
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,460
No.
One of the things you've said,

1039
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:02,503
he thought that women carried an image 
of Matt men in their unconscious and 

1040
00:55:06,621 --> 00:55:07,454
she,
he thought that the image that women 

1041
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:12,980
carried of men in their unconscious was 
a group of men,

1042
00:55:12,981 --> 00:55:16,460
not an individual matt,
he called that the animus.

1043
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:21,910
Whereas he believed that the image that 
women image of women that men carried in

1044
00:55:22,251 --> 00:55:23,084
their collective unconscious was of a 
single woman and he called that the 

1045
00:55:25,851 --> 00:55:27,230
anima.
Now I'm just,

1046
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,093
I'm just telling you that like I,
I'm not going to justify it or even 

1047
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,904
discuss it,
but I just want you to keep that in the 

1048
00:55:33,141 --> 00:55:34,590
back of your mind.
And

1049
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,003
so I guess part of the reason that that 
are telling me that come to think of it 

1050
00:55:40,791 --> 00:55:41,624
is that I think it may provide some 
insight into why the idea of the 

1051
00:55:45,561 --> 00:55:48,920
Patriarchy has become such a well 
accepted notion.

1052
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,113
Um,
because it is an architectural notion 

1053
00:55:52,161 --> 00:55:53,960
but it's a one sided architectural 
notion.

1054
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:56,090
Okay.
So back to sexual selection.

1055
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:57,643
Now

1056
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:01,743
we already talked about the fact that 
biologists perhaps were uncomfortable 

1057
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:05,494
with the idea of sexual selection 
because it brings a non random factor 

1058
00:56:08,951 --> 00:56:10,870
into evolution.
Uh,

1059
00:56:10,871 --> 00:56:11,704
seriously nonrandom random factor 
because you have to go back as far as 

1060
00:56:15,281 --> 00:56:16,114
you can in history to where there was no
choice on the part of the organism to 

1061
00:56:21,701 --> 00:56:24,520
attribute evolution,
natural selection alone.

1062
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,250
And you have to go a long ways back.
As I said,

1063
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:31,000
even butterflies are perfectly capable 
of distinguishing between a high quality

1064
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:34,630
butterfly partner in butterfly terms and
the low quality butterfly partner.

1065
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:38,170
And you know that that insects have been
around for a very,

1066
00:56:38,171 --> 00:56:39,004
very long time.
So we have no idea what that actually 

1067
00:56:43,301 --> 00:56:46,690
means is that we have no idea what rule 
choice has made in,

1068
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:50,620
in the evolutionary process.
But one thing that you can infer is that

1069
00:56:50,621 --> 00:56:51,454
the reason that human beings are the way
they are now and not like art chimp 

1070
00:56:55,060 --> 00:57:00,060
slash human ancestor is because the 
sexual selection process got started and

1071
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:02,260
it was intense.

1072
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:05,650
And so as a consequence of that,
well here we are.

1073
00:57:05,651 --> 00:57:06,161
And so,
you know,

1074
00:57:06,161 --> 00:57:07,690
maybe it was a good thing,
although it's,

1075
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:11,830
it's very hard in some sense and all 
those people who failed and that's,

1076
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:12,783
you know,
roughly speaking twice as many men as 

1077
00:57:14,591 --> 00:57:17,650
women.
So you know,

1078
00:57:17,651 --> 00:57:21,460
so then that also raises the question 
like who exactly,

1079
00:57:21,461 --> 00:57:23,650
who's responsible for the male dominance
arc?

1080
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:25,960
Cause you could say,
well it's male competitiveness,

1081
00:57:25,961 --> 00:57:26,980
but you could also say,
yeah,

1082
00:57:26,981 --> 00:57:29,230
well it's an inevitable function of 
female selection.

1083
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:30,743
And so,
which is not an argument that you hear 

1084
00:57:32,021 --> 00:57:32,854
very often,
but I think it's a very difficult 

1085
00:57:35,081 --> 00:57:37,450
argument to escape from.
And that leads us to our next

1086
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:40,300
hypothesis.
So we're going to say,

1087
00:57:40,301 --> 00:57:43,360
well the masculine dominance hierarchy 
is represented as masculine.

1088
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,940
I'm going to call that the great father 
for the time being.

1089
00:57:45,941 --> 00:57:49,180
And that's the permanent dominance 
hierarchy of men.

1090
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,340
And it's always there.
It moves through history.

1091
00:57:51,341 --> 00:57:55,720
It's different men all the time,
but it's like the men slot in and out as

1092
00:57:55,721 --> 00:57:56,554
they are born and die.
But the structure itself stays intact 

1093
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,470
across forever.
It's always there.

1094
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:04,930
It's been there at least for millions of
years.

1095
00:58:04,931 --> 00:58:07,480
So for our purposes,
we'll just call it permanent.

1096
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,660
It's a permanent part of the experience 
and it's a big part of it.

1097
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:13,840
And you know,
as culture it gets more and more

1098
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:17,103
covers larger and larger expanses of 
territory and gets more and more 

1099
00:58:19,391 --> 00:58:22,240
sophisticated.
It's an ever larger part of reality.

1100
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:23,763
So I mean,
most of us spend almost all our time 

1101
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:28,174
coping with the dominance hierarchy and 
almost none of our time combating 

1102
00:58:32,321 --> 00:58:33,131
nature.
You know,

1103
00:58:33,131 --> 00:58:36,520
you get wet and today you get wet for a 
little while and that's it,

1104
00:58:36,521 --> 00:58:37,354
you know?
But most of the problems that you would 

1105
00:58:38,861 --> 00:58:39,694
face in a purely natural environments,
like you're so distant from them that 

1106
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:44,643
you can hardly even imagine.
You can't even imagine what it would be 

1107
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:49,000
like in some sense to be in an 
environment like that.

1108
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:50,463
So yeah,

1109
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:55,850
caution is meant to be compared with,
like for example,

1110
00:58:59,011 --> 00:59:01,060
Jersey resonated with women and there's 
like some,

1111
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:04,560
some sort of competitive fitness and 
women with sandy worse from,

1112
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:07,890
so was driving
hard.

1113
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,013
Well that's a good question.
So the way I would answer that question 

1114
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:12,883
is two fold.
So the question was what drives women 

1115
00:59:15,561 --> 00:59:17,870
to,
to move to the top of the hierarchy?

1116
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:21,263
It's something that's worth discussing.
So if anybody objects to what I'm going 

1117
00:59:25,761 --> 00:59:26,840
to say,
then please do.

1118
00:59:26,841 --> 00:59:28,220
Because I'm not,
you know,

1119
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,040
dishing the cell does receive truth.
It's,

1120
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:31,874
it's,
I've been trying to figure this out and 

1121
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:33,764
this is what it looks like to me.
The first thing is I think they're male 

1122
00:59:36,651 --> 00:59:38,540
and female.
Dominic's archies both exist,

1123
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:42,560
but they're different and that females 
compete with each other intensely,

1124
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,083
but they don't compete for the same 
things and they don't compete the same 

1125
00:59:46,731 --> 00:59:51,320
way.
So let me tell you a little story.

1126
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:55,280
This is a bit of a divergence,
but it's an interesting point.

1127
00:59:55,281 --> 00:59:56,091
And one of the,
you know,

1128
00:59:56,091 --> 00:59:58,940
one of the questions I've always been 
asked in this class is because I'm going

1129
00:59:58,941 --> 00:59:59,774
to lay out a hero story for you and the 
fundamental hero archetype and the hero 

1130
01:00:03,741 --> 01:00:07,070
is masculine in mythology.
And so the women always ask,

1131
01:00:07,071 --> 01:00:08,420
well what about the role of the woman?

1132
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:10,280
And it's like it's very,
very complex,

1133
01:00:10,281 --> 01:00:12,650
which of course all you women already 
know because it is very,

1134
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:14,300
very complex.
So,

1135
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,790
but it isn't something that,
first of all,

1136
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:17,624
I don't think it was a question that 
would have been asked before the 

1137
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:24,350
invention of the birth control pill 
because we know what the table,

1138
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:27,080
we know what the archetypal female is 
prior to that.

1139
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:30,290
It's the Virgin Mary with with child,
it's virgin with child,

1140
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:35,420
which means like it means that the unit 
for woman is woman with child.

1141
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,700
It's not woman,
it's woman with a child.

1142
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:43,450
And well that's obvious why that is.
Because as soon as you become a woman in

1143
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:47,210
most societies you have a child before 
that you were a girl.

1144
01:00:47,211 --> 01:00:48,460
And that's,
you know,

1145
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,320
that's in some sense that's irrelevant,
you know,

1146
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:55,010
in terms of your destiny.
Now you might say,

1147
01:00:55,011 --> 01:00:55,844
well,
what,

1148
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:00,080
what's your architectural pattern if 
you're not a mother?

1149
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:01,603
While the way it looks to me is that
there's two archetypes for personal 

1150
01:01:06,771 --> 01:01:09,110
development,
for the personal path,

1151
01:01:09,111 --> 01:01:11,420
roughly speaking,
there's the hero.

1152
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:13,303
And that would be the person who 
explores the unknown and discover 

1153
01:01:16,011 --> 01:01:19,400
something of value and brings it back 
and distributes it to the community.

1154
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,350
So it's like a hunting,
it's like,

1155
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:24,380
it's probably predicated on a hunting,
uh,

1156
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:25,723
platform because we,
our bodies are hunting platforms 

1157
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,830
basically.
So,

1158
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:33,500
you know,
and one theory about what men did,

1159
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,053
which is a very probable theory,
is that they went out and hunted for 

1160
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:39,320
meat and chimps like meat.
They'll eat it whenever they can.

1161
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:40,550
And although they're not very good 
hunters,

1162
01:01:40,551 --> 01:01:41,384
but they will definitely eat meat.
And human beings are so good at hunting 

1163
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:45,530
that we probably,
well,

1164
01:01:45,531 --> 01:01:47,630
for example,
we probably wiped out the mammoth.

1165
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:50,900
And when human beings came into North 
America,

1166
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:51,913
there was as many different kinds of 
large animals in North America as there 

1167
01:01:54,081 --> 01:01:56,570
was an Africa and human beings killed 
all of them.

1168
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,490
And that was just with,
you know,

1169
01:01:58,491 --> 01:02:03,491
like they didn't have our notion of 
technologically sophisticated weapons.

1170
01:02:04,491 --> 01:02:07,910
It was bows and arrows and clubs and 
spears and nonetheless,

1171
01:02:07,911 --> 01:02:11,330
like they got rid of everything,
you know,

1172
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:14,120
large cats,
giant beavers,

1173
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:15,730
mammoths,
um,

1174
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:18,471
we're very,
very,

1175
01:02:18,471 --> 01:02:19,620
very,
very dangerous.

1176
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,140
And anyways,
so,

1177
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:25,530
but then there's another archetype,
which is the,

1178
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:28,200
I would say it's the maternal archetype 
in a sense.

1179
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:29,783
And one of the things that's very 
interesting about human males is that 

1180
01:02:31,741 --> 01:02:36,000
they're quite maternal by comparison to 
other animals.

1181
01:02:36,001 --> 01:02:36,834
So for example,
like the mother bear doesn't have them 

1182
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:41,340
mail there.
The board,

1183
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:44,790
he said bores and sounds with bears,
I think it is anyways,

1184
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:46,043
um,
you keep the cubs away from the mail 

1185
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:48,810
because he'll kill them.
Now,

1186
01:02:48,811 --> 01:02:50,790
not all males will be that,
but many will,

1187
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:54,290
they don't have any filial,
um,

1188
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:00,060
attachment.
And that's the case for many,

1189
01:03:00,061 --> 01:03:02,340
but not all complex mammals.

1190
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:03,323
You know,
pair bonding on a permanent basis is 

1191
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:09,900
relatively rare,
but joint provision of children,

1192
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:13,403
that's exceedingly rare.
And men are pretty good at taking care 

1193
01:03:16,021 --> 01:03:16,890
of children.
You know,

1194
01:03:16,891 --> 01:03:17,724
they're,
I would say they're not as good at 

1195
01:03:18,301 --> 01:03:19,134
taking care of infants as women are 
because they don't have the full range 

1196
01:03:21,451 --> 01:03:26,451
of resources at hand and they're not,
I don't think they're,

1197
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,590
they,
I don't think they have the same kind of

1198
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:34,070
immediate intuitive understanding of or 
attraction to babies that men have.

1199
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:35,813
I think that switches around the age of 
two or two and a half when the kids can 

1200
01:03:39,961 --> 01:03:40,794
engage in rough and tumble play because 
men are much more likely to engage in 

1201
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:46,380
rough and tumble play with children than
women are.

1202
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:47,453
And rough and tumble play seems to be 
one of the things that civilizes 

1203
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:52,470
children.
And it's partly because,

1204
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:54,450
you know,
one of the things that you have to learn

1205
01:03:54,451 --> 01:03:55,284
when you're a child is what actually 
hurts you and what can be ignored and 

1206
01:03:59,341 --> 01:04:00,174
what actually hurts someone else and 
what can be ignored and the best way to 

1207
01:04:02,731 --> 01:04:04,260
learn that as in rough and tumble play.

1208
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:07,290
Because what happens is that if you 
playing with a kid,

1209
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:10,650
they get more and more excited than they
do more and more crazy things until they

1210
01:04:10,651 --> 01:04:13,230
do something that either hurts them or,
or hurts you.

1211
01:04:13,231 --> 01:04:14,280
And then you have to say,
look,

1212
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:15,060
you know,
that's,

1213
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,140
you can't do that.
And,

1214
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:18,270
and it's,
it's like a dance in a sense.

1215
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:19,104
You know,
when you're wrestling with a little kid 

1216
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:23,820
and you have to let them win fairly 
frequently because otherwise they don't,

1217
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:25,013
they don't continue the game.
And you can tell him that because if 

1218
01:04:26,851 --> 01:04:28,350
there,
if the game is going well,

1219
01:04:28,351 --> 01:04:29,184
they're laughing with insane delight 
because kids just love rough and tumble 

1220
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:33,960
play,
you know?

1221
01:04:33,961 --> 01:04:35,340
And,
and they love crazy things.

1222
01:04:35,341 --> 01:04:36,174
I mean,
you can throw them in the air and catch 

1223
01:04:36,901 --> 01:04:38,780
them and they think that's just great,
you know?

1224
01:04:38,781 --> 01:04:39,614
And,
but partly what you're doing is you're 

1225
01:04:40,561 --> 01:04:41,394
extending their body in all sorts of 
ways in getting them to learn in an 

1226
01:04:44,641 --> 01:04:45,474
embodied sense where the limits of that,
where their limits are and where the 

1227
01:04:48,871 --> 01:04:49,950
limits of other people are.

1228
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:52,830
And that's embodied in children who 
haven't had that man.

1229
01:04:52,831 --> 01:04:54,960
They're just so awkward.
It's unbelievable.

1230
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:56,183
You know,
they might have some hypothetical sense 

1231
01:04:57,391 --> 01:05:01,290
of how to interact with another person,
but they don't have an embodied sense of

1232
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:02,124
it.
And they can't tell the difference 

1233
01:05:02,971 --> 01:05:04,620
between what hurts them and what 
doesn't.

1234
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:06,810
You know,
cause often a young child,

1235
01:05:06,811 --> 01:05:07,830
if,
if they're startled,

1236
01:05:07,831 --> 01:05:10,050
they'll start to cry and then you can 
say,

1237
01:05:10,051 --> 01:05:10,471
well,
you know,

1238
01:05:10,471 --> 01:05:12,030
that didn't hurt.
And then they'll notice,

1239
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,080
oh yeah,
that didn't hurt.

1240
01:05:13,081 --> 01:05:13,914
And they'll stop crying.
But if they haven't had their limits 

1241
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:20,020
tested,
they'll cry at anything unexpected,

1242
01:05:20,021 --> 01:05:20,854
even if it doesn't hurt.
And that's not good because if you cry 

1243
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:26,620
under all conditions,
the probability that you'll make friends

1244
01:05:26,621 --> 01:05:27,454
when you're three is like zero because 
another kid will start playing with you 

1245
01:05:30,071 --> 01:05:32,770
and maybe play rough.
And if you burst into tears,

1246
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,810
you know,
several times the person,

1247
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,150
the kid is just going to go somewhere 
else and find a different playmate,

1248
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:39,160
you know,
they'll say you're just a baby,

1249
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:42,550
which is roughly exactly accurate.
Roughly.

1250
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:44,830
Exactly.
Roughly accurate.

1251
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:48,880
So,
so anyways,

1252
01:05:48,881 --> 01:05:52,450
I'm back to the architectural 
representation.

1253
01:05:52,451 --> 01:05:55,420
I think really the way to think about it
is that for men,

1254
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:56,553
the hero archetype is the,
is the archetype that's dominant and in 

1255
01:05:59,321 --> 01:06:03,100
the forefront and the maternal archetype
is his subordinate.

1256
01:06:03,101 --> 01:06:05,920
And in the background,
I mean in inside their own psyches.

1257
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:11,100
Whereas with women it's reversed.
So each of the genders can play the role

1258
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:12,334
of the other gender,
but there's a tilt in each of them 

1259
01:06:13,691 --> 01:06:16,060
towards the,
what would you say?

1260
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,540
Well,
towards gender,

1261
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:24,190
I would say towards typical human gender
normative behavior.

1262
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:26,470
Now,
the social constructionist believed that

1263
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,633
no such thing exists,
but those people are so pathological 

1264
01:06:29,561 --> 01:06:31,960
that even considering what they have to 
say is a mistake.

1265
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:33,243
So they act as if people have,
they act as if there is no biology and 

1266
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:39,820
everything's cultural and it's like,
well,

1267
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:42,460
no,
that's just not right now.

1268
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:46,240
What biology means in practice and what 
you should do about it.

1269
01:06:46,241 --> 01:06:49,300
That's a whole different question.
But to think of all these differences as

1270
01:06:49,301 --> 01:06:50,134
socially height differences between men 
and women are not socially constructed 

1271
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:54,753
and they they're relevant and the upper 
body strength differences between men 

1272
01:06:57,971 --> 01:07:00,610
and women are not socially constructed 
and they're relevant to,

1273
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:02,123
you know.
So one of the things I was wondering 

1274
01:07:03,701 --> 01:07:04,534
about,
maybe you guys can help me clarify this 

1275
01:07:05,891 --> 01:07:06,724
or tell me where I'm not thinking about 
this property and if you think there's 

1276
01:07:10,211 --> 01:07:11,710
any,
if I'm missing something,

1277
01:07:11,711 --> 01:07:12,544
letting me know.

1278
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,780
One of the things my daughter said,
she watched my,

1279
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:20,470
my son one day have a fight with his 
best friend.

1280
01:07:20,471 --> 01:07:21,820
It was a physical fight,
you know,

1281
01:07:21,821 --> 01:07:22,654
and so his best friend did something 
that my son didn't regard it as 

1282
01:07:25,781 --> 01:07:29,440
appropriate and so he hit him and then 
there was a fight and then you know,

1283
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,090
three days later they were friends 
again.

1284
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:36,220
And my daughter said to me that she was 
very annoyed by that,

1285
01:07:36,221 --> 01:07:37,054
which wasn't the fight exactly,
but the fact that they could have a 

1286
01:07:39,551 --> 01:07:40,384
fight and then they were friends again 
three days later because she said that 

1287
01:07:42,281 --> 01:07:45,970
that option wasn't available to women 
right now.

1288
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:49,150
And the option is the option that the 
men have is,

1289
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:50,043
well if you get out of handle just Saki 
one and then we'll have established 

1290
01:07:53,261 --> 01:07:56,980
where the boundaries of of civilized 
behavior begin and end.

1291
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:58,263
And I would say that in my experience,
if I'm talking to someone who self 

1292
01:08:02,591 --> 01:08:05,710
confident and masculine and 
accomplished,

1293
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:08,890
there's always an undercurrent of 
potential violence.

1294
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:12,790
It's an undercurrent and that's actually
an undercurrent of respect,

1295
01:08:12,791 --> 01:08:16,550
which means like there's things that we 
can do to each other in a civilized way.

1296
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:19,820
But there are rules that if you break 
like all hell's gonna break loose.

1297
01:08:19,821 --> 01:08:20,654
And one of the consequences of that is 
that it doesn't right now the typical 

1298
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:30,230
bullying pattern for women in high 
school and junior highs is reputation,

1299
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:34,970
destruction.
And I'm wondering what does,

1300
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:35,833
what are the implications for the 
conduct of behavior if there is no 

1301
01:08:40,311 --> 01:08:43,340
recourse to aggression to solve disputes

1302
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:48,750
cause they don't get solved.
You know,

1303
01:08:48,751 --> 01:08:49,584
I've tried to analyze what it means to 
say no to someone cause no means 

1304
01:08:52,471 --> 01:08:53,304
something,
right?

1305
01:08:53,310 --> 01:08:58,310
No means while if you tell a child know 
what you're basically telling the child.

1306
01:08:58,591 --> 01:09:01,500
As far as I can tell is that if you 
continue doing that,

1307
01:09:01,501 --> 01:09:03,210
something you don't like will happen to 
you.

1308
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:05,910
And then if you're civilized at saying 
no,

1309
01:09:05,911 --> 01:09:06,744
what happens is you say no a couple of 
times and then instead of devaluing the 

1310
01:09:11,491 --> 01:09:12,810
word,
which is what you do,

1311
01:09:12,811 --> 01:09:15,990
if you just said it over and over a 
hundred times with no consequences,

1312
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:20,760
you take action that's nonverbal.
And so one of the things you might do is

1313
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:24,840
remove the child from the situation or 
you might put them on the steps or maybe

1314
01:09:24,841 --> 01:09:26,340
you put them on the steps and they run 
away.

1315
01:09:26,341 --> 01:09:29,070
So you have to hold them on the steps.
But the point is,

1316
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:33,810
the point to the child is there are 
limits and if you exceed them,

1317
01:09:33,811 --> 01:09:34,644
you will be physically control.
What if there's no option for physical 

1318
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:41,190
control?
What happens?

1319
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:44,550
Well,
I don't know the answer to that.

1320
01:09:44,551 --> 01:09:45,384
I don't know what women do about that,
but I also don't know what men do about 

1321
01:09:47,821 --> 01:09:48,654
that in relationship to women.
So I was watching something the other 

1322
01:09:51,091 --> 01:09:52,920
day.
It was this,

1323
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:58,550
I posted it on my twitter account as an 
as an example of animus possession.

1324
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,300
So this a woman and a man,
we're having a dispute on the street.

1325
01:10:03,301 --> 01:10:04,134
It was a political dispute and this 
particular woman was like the way she 

1326
01:10:07,231 --> 01:10:12,231
was behaving towards this particular man
was such that had she been a man and had

1327
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:15,540
he been a man,
he would have definitely hit her because

1328
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:16,374
she was right in his face and she was 
cursing at him and swearing and calling 

1329
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:22,110
them an idiot and like really like being
hyper aggressive.

1330
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:23,940
Of course he couldn't do anything about 
it.

1331
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:25,283
So then I was watching that and I was 
thinking just exactly what are you 

1332
01:10:27,511 --> 01:10:28,344
supposed to do in a situation like that 
because you're screwed no matter what 

1333
01:10:31,111 --> 01:10:31,410
you do.

1334
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:33,460
If you're on the male side,
it's like you can't eat,

1335
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,433
you can't,
you certainly can't intervene 

1336
01:10:35,641 --> 01:10:36,474
physically.
It's like you're dead in the water 

1337
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:38,003
instant instantly in your eyes,
the eyes of society and in the woman's 

1338
01:10:41,731 --> 01:10:44,430
eyes instantly if you move past the 
boundary,

1339
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:48,800
if you leave,
well there's no glory.

1340
01:10:48,801 --> 01:10:50,250
And running away,
that's for sure.

1341
01:10:50,251 --> 01:10:51,084
So what exactly is supposed to happen?
I have no idea what supposed to happen 

1342
01:10:56,221 --> 01:10:58,860
in a situation like that.
I think what happens,

1343
01:10:58,861 --> 01:10:59,694
what will happen over time is that man 
just won't put themselves in those 

1344
01:11:01,651 --> 01:11:02,484
situations.
I think what the male would have to do 

1345
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:10,011
in that situation is behave like a woman
in a female dominance hierarchies.

1346
01:11:11,611 --> 01:11:16,611
So he stands there and takes it and then
afterwards it goes off and bad smell,

1347
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:22,150
bad mouth search,
social circle of uh Huh.

1348
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:23,641
Right,
right.

1349
01:11:23,641 --> 01:11:24,474
But you know,
that's definitely not seen as an 

1350
01:11:25,591 --> 01:11:30,050
admirable form of behavior among men.
So I mean,

1351
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:31,830
I don't think it's an admirable form of 
behavior,

1352
01:11:31,831 --> 01:11:32,664
period,
but,

1353
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:33,640
but I mean,
you know,

1354
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:35,490
I mean aggression is often not 
admirable,

1355
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,990
so that,
so that's fine.

1356
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:41,930
Yeah.
When you take away emotion like it,

1357
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:42,773
when someone's acting aggressively 
towards you and you've reserved your 

1358
01:11:44,851 --> 01:11:47,610
emotion,
it gives them a lot less to feed off of.

1359
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:51,900
And that ends up taking power away in a 
similar way that aggression does because

1360
01:11:51,901 --> 01:11:56,490
people react aggressively and they want 
to feed back.

1361
01:11:56,940 --> 01:11:57,810
That gives them more.

1362
01:11:57,990 --> 01:11:58,920
Oh,
definitely.

1363
01:11:59,070 --> 01:11:59,903
Oh yeah.
Would it be a real victory for her if 

1364
01:12:00,871 --> 01:12:02,340
she would've got slapped?
Yeah,

1365
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,750
absolutely.
Because it would have,

1366
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:06,510
it would have proved everything she said
instantly.

1367
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:06,961
Yeah,
yeah,

1368
01:12:06,961 --> 01:12:07,770
yeah,
definitely.

1369
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:09,780
But when you dismiss power is gone.

1370
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:11,500
Yeah.
You have all the power.

1371
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:13,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

1372
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:17,530
Well I think that that would be a 
reasonably effective strategy for us.

1373
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:19,960
A street con,
a street confrontation like that,

1374
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:22,390
I'm not so sure how well it would work 
in a,

1375
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:24,760
in a prolonged competition inside a 
company,

1376
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:27,420
for example.
Right.

1377
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:30,370
The short hair,
you know,

1378
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:31,060
hierarchy.
Yeah.

1379
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,620
Because you know,
the truth of the matter is,

1380
01:12:32,621 --> 01:12:34,990
is that men have no idea how to treat 
women.

1381
01:12:34,991 --> 01:12:38,830
If they're in male power hierarchies,
they have no idea how to treat them.

1382
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:41,140
And that's because we have no idea how 
to do that.

1383
01:12:41,141 --> 01:12:44,950
No one has any idea how to do that.
It's only been happening in any,

1384
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,230
you know,
pronounce since for about,

1385
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:50,773
well,

1386
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:53,030
on a societal level,
really,

1387
01:12:53,031 --> 01:12:54,960
probably since the mid seventies you 
know,

1388
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:56,930
it's,
it's three generations,

1389
01:12:56,931 --> 01:12:59,300
it's a drop in the bucket and it's in 
very,

1390
01:12:59,301 --> 01:13:01,880
very difficult thing to sort out.
So,

1391
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:03,523
I mean,
part of the reason that I'm thinking 

1392
01:13:04,071 --> 01:13:04,904
about these sorts of things is because 
I've been very interested in the fact 

1393
01:13:08,031 --> 01:13:08,864
that male men are doing very badly in 
junior high and high school and they're 

1394
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:13,340
bailing out of the universities like 
math.

1395
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:14,443
Like at the rate it's going,
there'll be almost no men in most 

1396
01:13:16,521 --> 01:13:18,830
disciplines within 10 years.
So I mean,

1397
01:13:18,831 --> 01:13:21,230
you can tell that even in this class,
no,

1398
01:13:21,231 --> 01:13:23,960
although it's funny because on my 
youtube videos,

1399
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:27,830
I w I look at the gender distribution 
for viewing and it's 80% male,

1400
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:29,320
which,
you know,

1401
01:13:29,390 --> 01:13:30,400
it's interesting to me.
I,

1402
01:13:30,401 --> 01:13:32,360
I,
I'm not sure exactly why that is,

1403
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:36,350
but in lots of fields it's,
it's 80 20 women already.

1404
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:39,620
And so I can't,
I can't see why that won't.

1405
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:42,680
I think it will accelerate as we move 
forward rather than slowing down.

1406
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:44,990
So.
All right.

1407
01:13:44,991 --> 01:13:49,370
So anyways,
back to sexual selection and,

1408
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:53,180
and the power hierarchy.
No,

1409
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:56,903
from a Darwinian perspective,
one of the things that you might do is 

1410
01:13:59,761 --> 01:14:01,530
call whatever's selects nature.

1411
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:04,953
And so when we think of nature,
and when you think about nature from a 

1412
01:14:07,781 --> 01:14:11,080
scientific perspective,
we don't ever think about humans as,

1413
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:13,390
as agents of nature,
right?

1414
01:14:13,391 --> 01:14:17,140
We tend to conceive of the human being 
as something that stands against nature,

1415
01:14:17,170 --> 01:14:18,700
right?
That's a mythology.

1416
01:14:18,701 --> 01:14:21,040
It's like the human being against the 
natural world.

1417
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:21,874
It's a very common,
it's very common plot in movies and in 

1418
01:14:24,311 --> 01:14:27,040
stories.
So it's man against nature,

1419
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:32,041
roughly speaking.
So we tend to think of those as separate

1420
01:14:32,561 --> 01:14:33,460
categories.
But

1421
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:38,620
if women do the selection among human 
beings,

1422
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:45,420
at least they do the intense selection 
than women are nature for men.

1423
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:48,160
And that's exactly what the archetype 
is.

1424
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,473
It's mother nature.
And Mother Nature has a very vicious 

1425
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:55,960
element.
And the vicious element of Mother Nature

1426
01:14:55,961 --> 01:14:59,020
is rejection.
And that can be maternal rejection,

1427
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:00,100
which is,
you know,

1428
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:02,860
certainly something that causes a 
tremendous amount of trauma.

1429
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:04,330
But it can also be

1430
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:09,090
the more,
the most fundamental form of rejection,

1431
01:15:09,091 --> 01:15:09,924
which is which,
and the most fundamental form of 

1432
01:15:11,731 --> 01:15:14,840
rejection,
it's sexual rejection because it,

1433
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:20,150
it means that you are judged as 
biologically I'm worthy,

1434
01:15:20,161 --> 01:15:24,570
roughly speaking.
So there's other reasons why.

1435
01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:25,780
So the reason I'm,
I'm,

1436
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:26,753
I'm telling you this because I've been 
trying to puzzle out what you see in 

1437
01:15:29,671 --> 01:15:30,504
mythology quite clearly,
is that the dominance hierarchy is 

1438
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:36,450
represented as male.
So culture is male and nature is female.

1439
01:15:36,451 --> 01:15:38,280
I thought,
why the hell would nature be female?

1440
01:15:38,281 --> 01:15:38,850
It's like,
okay,

1441
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:42,240
well I've given you one reason.
And I think it's the primary reason.

1442
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:43,433
There's other reasons,
because nature is also seen as that 

1443
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:48,930
which produces natural forms.
Of course,

1444
01:15:48,931 --> 01:15:51,270
women produce natural forms.
So that's,

1445
01:15:51,330 --> 01:15:54,780
that's a logical association.
And then

1446
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:00,330
what's the other one that was about,

1447
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,153
well,
we can leave it at that for the time 

1448
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:07,624
being.
So now let me show you how I think that 

1449
01:16:11,261 --> 01:16:12,190
that's represented.

1450
01:16:23,230 --> 01:16:24,063
I think this is the,
I think this is the way the world is 

1451
01:16:26,321 --> 01:16:28,840
structured when you consider it as a 
place of action.

1452
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:34,300
So the world has a place of action,
has characters not like the elements are

1453
01:16:34,301 --> 01:16:36,500
characters and the characters are 
engaged in,

1454
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:40,330
in dramatic behavior.
So,

1455
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:45,280
and there are classes of characters.
And as far as I can tell,

1456
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,840
this is a reasonably comprehensive 
classification of dramatic characters.

1457
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,540
And we'll start from the inside and go 
out.

1458
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:56,740
And you can think of any of these as 
primary by the way.

1459
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,470
And you'll see that reflected in 
different kinds of mythology.

1460
01:16:59,471 --> 01:17:00,304
So sometimes the maternal is primary and
sometimes the culture is primary and 

1461
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:06,670
sometimes that the hero,
the individual's primary.

1462
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:07,953
And I think that's because these three 
things are irreducibly primary in that 

1463
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,230
from uh,
from the perspective of consciousness.

1464
01:17:15,231 --> 01:17:18,140
In that to be conscious there has to be 
you.

1465
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,233
But if you're conscious,
you have to have evolved within a 

1466
01:17:22,071 --> 01:17:25,460
culture and that culture is necessarily 
nested in the natural world.

1467
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:29,090
And so wherever there's one,
there's all three.

1468
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:33,140
And the individual is also the thing.
Without the individual,

1469
01:17:33,141 --> 01:17:35,570
there wouldn't be any separation between
nature and culture.

1470
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:36,404
And so you can see the individual,
individual consciousness is the 

1471
01:17:38,241 --> 01:17:39,074
generator of the entire structure.
But you can say that about any of the 

1472
01:17:41,781 --> 01:17:42,614
characters.
So there's the architectural son cause 

1473
01:17:45,711 --> 01:17:49,130
the hero tends to be masculine and then 
it has a,

1474
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:53,390
that character has a positive element 
and a negative element.

1475
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:57,200
And the positive element is the good,
the good person.

1476
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:58,940
And the negative element is the bad 
person.

1477
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:00,343
And I would say the architectural 
representations of those are like the 

1478
01:18:04,161 --> 01:18:07,610
savior and Satan.
And that's basically,

1479
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:08,563
there are portrayals like that in 
virtually every system of mythology and 

1480
01:18:12,531 --> 01:18:13,364
religion.
Now it seems to me that in some sense 

1481
01:18:15,561 --> 01:18:16,394
Christianity,
and this was probably under the 

1482
01:18:17,631 --> 01:18:18,464
influence of the zero astrons develop 
the most articulated representation of 

1483
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:27,590
good versus evil at the individual 
level.

1484
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,513
And that's why you can identify two 
fundamental characters in the Christian 

1485
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,710
story,
so to speak,

1486
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:36,544
that play out these rules.
And they're seen as eternally 

1487
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:40,750
adversaries locked in battle across 
time.

1488
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,393
And that would be the battle it takes 
place in the natural world about what 

1489
01:18:45,001 --> 01:18:45,834
takes place in the cultural world.
And the battle takes place within as 

1490
01:18:48,191 --> 01:18:49,024
well.

1491
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:50,330
Okay.

1492
01:18:50,330 --> 01:18:51,163
So,
and you can see that reflected in 

1493
01:18:51,711 --> 01:18:54,190
stories all the time because you know,
if it's so,

1494
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:57,470
it's so frequently the case that you 
know,

1495
01:18:57,471 --> 01:19:00,500
the hero,
the superhero has his nemesis,

1496
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:01,363
right?
And it's the guy that he's 

1497
01:19:01,791 --> 01:19:02,624
extraordinarily well matched with who 
continually tests his wits and whose 

1498
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:07,933
motivation is essentially destructive.
And so you see that with Batman and the 

1499
01:19:10,821 --> 01:19:11,654
joker for example,
for you see it with Sherlock Holmes and 

1500
01:19:13,851 --> 01:19:16,550
Moriarty or,
I mean there's always,

1501
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:19,160
there's always this,
this pairing is pairing.

1502
01:19:19,161 --> 01:19:19,994
And that's partly because I think there 
are the archetipal realms of human 

1503
01:19:23,811 --> 01:19:27,830
decision making or something like are 
you working to make things better or are

1504
01:19:27,831 --> 01:19:28,664
you working to make things worse?
Are you possessed by resentment and 

1505
01:19:30,801 --> 01:19:33,770
hatred so that you want things to 
degenerate and burn?

1506
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:36,770
Or are you hopeful and,
and,

1507
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:37,873
and capable of manifesting faith in the 
future so that you're working to make 

1508
01:19:40,971 --> 01:19:44,000
things better.
And then there's a battle in everyone,

1509
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:47,330
in their own psyches.
And then there's a battle in culture.

1510
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:50,210
There's a battle every year between 
those two fundamental perspectives.

1511
01:19:51,410 --> 01:19:52,243
And then
the archetipal son is the son of the 

1512
01:19:55,371 --> 01:19:58,190
great farther in the great father 
represents two things.

1513
01:19:58,191 --> 01:19:58,990
Order,
interior,

1514
01:19:58,990 --> 01:19:59,840
Neri,
tyranny.

1515
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,930
So there's the hero in the adversary at 
the individual level.

1516
01:20:04,390 --> 01:20:04,920
Okay.

1517
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:07,080
And at the social level there's order 
and tyranny.

1518
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,210
And so roughly speaking,
that's that.

1519
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:14,610
See that the wise king or the Desk Bach 
and the desk bod is someone who tries to

1520
01:20:14,611 --> 01:20:15,444
eat his own sons,
which is actually a fairly common 

1521
01:20:17,101 --> 01:20:19,230
mythological trope.
And you know,

1522
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:24,231
you're under the thumb of a desperate 
when you're not allowed really either to

1523
01:20:24,451 --> 01:20:25,284
be hero or adversary,
you're just a cog in the structure of 

1524
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:32,550
the,
of the social world.

1525
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:37,020
So that's despotism on the orderly side.
Well,

1526
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:39,630
culture is what,
that's what we're sitting in right now.

1527
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:43,500
I mean this is social order that it 
encapsulates us.

1528
01:20:43,501 --> 01:20:45,620
Everything about it is social order.
I mean there,

1529
01:20:45,621 --> 01:20:49,230
there are rows there roughly linear,
you know,

1530
01:20:49,231 --> 01:20:50,064
everyone's in their place.
Everyone knows exactly what to do were 

1531
01:20:52,141 --> 01:20:54,750
unbelievably well protected from,
from,

1532
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:57,510
from virtually anything you could 
possibly imagine.

1533
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,880
And so,
you know,

1534
01:20:59,881 --> 01:21:03,330
we're in our father's living room,
so to speak.

1535
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:07,170
And in that living room,
it's a safe space.

1536
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,700
Oh God,
I should've never said that.

1537
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,133
Anyways.
It's a well protected space in which 

1538
01:21:13,411 --> 01:21:14,244
people are able to play and explore.
And it seems to me that one of the 

1539
01:21:19,231 --> 01:21:23,130
functions that fathers play in a family,
if they're playing,

1540
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,083
they're,
if they're fulfilling their function 

1541
01:21:25,501 --> 01:21:26,334
properly,
is that what they do is put a perimeter 

1542
01:21:27,931 --> 01:21:30,770
around the territory so that inside the 
wall,

1543
01:21:30,771 --> 01:21:32,130
so to speak,
it's safe.

1544
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,233
And inside the safe walls the children 
can play and explore and in their 

1545
01:21:36,241 --> 01:21:38,910
playing and exploring and they developed
their own individuality.

1546
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:42,270
And so you know,
you keep the darkness at bay and you can

1547
01:21:42,271 --> 01:21:43,104
certainly see that that's what children 
want because as soon as you put them in 

1548
01:21:45,421 --> 01:21:47,640
a dark room,
the first thing they say is,

1549
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:48,673
you know,
come chase the monsters away out from 

1550
01:21:51,121 --> 01:21:51,960
underneath the bed.

1551
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:53,213
And you know,
they wouldn't be thinking that if they 

1552
01:21:54,841 --> 01:21:55,674
hadn't had an extraordinary long 
evolutionary history of being chased by 

1553
01:21:59,761 --> 01:22:02,220
monsters in the dark.
So,

1554
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:05,610
and there are monsters in the dark and 
everyone knows that,

1555
01:22:05,611 --> 01:22:08,850
which is why you tell your children not 
to go play at night after you know,

1556
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,090
after it's dark even now.
So,

1557
01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:17,220
so order and tyranny are the,
are the representations of culture.

1558
01:22:17,221 --> 01:22:18,054
And the thing is,
is that there's a constant interplay 

1559
01:22:20,191 --> 01:22:25,191
between those two because you can never 
tell exactly when order has gone too far

1560
01:22:25,201 --> 01:22:27,540
and become tyranny.
So,

1561
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:29,220
and you can,
can never tell really when,

1562
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:33,030
when there's so little order that while 
the next thing happens,

1563
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:33,864
which is the emergence of chaos and 
chaos is the great mother and it's 

1564
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:42,780
creative and destructive and that's 
nature itself.

1565
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:45,780
And so,
and then on outside,

1566
01:22:45,781 --> 01:22:46,614
the very outside,
and this is the most complicated 

1567
01:22:47,761 --> 01:22:51,390
category of all,
is that it's the dragon of chaos.

1568
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:54,630
And it represents something that's very 
difficult to conceptualize,

1569
01:22:54,631 --> 01:22:55,464
but it's the UN configured substructure 
of being that gives rise to these other 

1570
01:23:02,341 --> 01:23:03,174
categories.
So Donald Rumsfeld at point made a very 

1571
01:23:05,861 --> 01:23:06,970
famous comment.
It become,

1572
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,210
it became famous because,
because it,

1573
01:23:09,211 --> 01:23:10,990
it fits in architectural structure.
He said,

1574
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:13,690
there are known unknowns and unknown 
unknowns.

1575
01:23:14,770 --> 01:23:15,603
Okay?
The dragon of chaos is the unknown 

1576
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:19,270
unknown.
It's,

1577
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:21,790
it's so unknown that you don't even know
it's there,

1578
01:23:21,791 --> 01:23:24,400
but it can write,
raise its head at any given point.

1579
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:28,060
It's the thing that leaps out of you in 
the darkness.

1580
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:29,800
It's like the,
is it Zika?

1581
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:32,590
Is that the new virus?
It's like the Zika virus.

1582
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:33,424
It's like no one saw it coming.
It's a completely new manifestation of 

1583
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:37,533
of being and so known.
Unknown's you can make plans to 

1584
01:23:41,291 --> 01:23:42,124
circumvent unknown unknown's they 
they're completely unpredictable and 

1585
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:49,210
what's so interesting,
this is where it's so bloody complicated

1586
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:50,103
because you really have to think about 
things differently to grasp what this 

1587
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:54,094
means.

1588
01:23:59,590 --> 01:24:00,423
This is part of the reason that I have 
trouble with the section of this course 

1589
01:24:02,561 --> 01:24:05,260
on alchemy because it's so complicated 
that it's okay.

1590
01:24:05,261 --> 01:24:07,540
So here,
think of it this way.

1591
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:13,690
What is the unknown made up?
That's a pretty weird question.

1592
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:15,620
So,
so I'll,

1593
01:24:15,621 --> 01:24:16,454
I'll try to walk you through it and we 
won't get very far with this because 

1594
01:24:18,551 --> 01:24:19,384
we'll have to do it 15 or 20 times I 
think before it starts to become 

1595
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:24,580
something that you can,
that you can grapple with.

1596
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:28,780
All right,
so it's September 11th,

1597
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:30,310
2011 in the twin towers have just 
fallen.

1598
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,190
Sorry,
2001 yes,

1599
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:35,140
yes.
Nine 11 alright.

1600
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:39,280
What's emerged?
What's happened?

1601
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:41,493
Well,
one answer to that is that the tower is 

1602
01:24:42,341 --> 01:24:44,530
fail,
but it's in very,

1603
01:24:44,531 --> 01:24:49,531
very poor answer because that was an 
unknown unknown,

1604
01:24:50,110 --> 01:24:52,510
I would say.
And it traumatize people.

1605
01:24:53,290 --> 01:24:54,123
I mean,
everyone even in Toronto walked around 

1606
01:24:55,121 --> 01:24:56,770
in shock for about two days after that.

1607
01:24:56,770 --> 01:24:57,603
And the reason was for that was that we 
didn't know what felt the buildings 

1608
01:25:01,571 --> 01:25:02,404
fail.
But the thing is the buildings aren't 

1609
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:07,280
isolated.
Like they're not some abandoned building

1610
01:25:07,281 --> 01:25:08,114
standing out there in the middle of the 
field in a barren wasteland in the 

1611
01:25:11,081 --> 01:25:14,260
middle of an abandoned country.
They weren't buildings.

1612
01:25:14,261 --> 01:25:15,094
Exactly.
They're only buildings at the most 

1613
01:25:16,241 --> 01:25:18,070
superficial level.
First of all,

1614
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:21,370
they had 5,000 people in them,
or 5,000 people died.

1615
01:25:21,371 --> 01:25:22,204
If I remember correctly.
And then all of those people were 

1616
01:25:26,201 --> 01:25:27,034
networked out with all sorts of other 
people and they were networked at 

1617
01:25:29,531 --> 01:25:31,450
multiple levels.
So they were family members,

1618
01:25:31,451 --> 01:25:35,530
but they were also elements in the 
financial and economic machine.

1619
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:41,640
And then and in the political machine.
And then what,

1620
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,740
what was hit was of course,
not just the buildings,

1621
01:25:44,741 --> 01:25:48,190
but the economic and political system,
whatever that means.

1622
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:49,263
And of course the people who took the 
towers down weren't trying to knock 

1623
01:25:53,111 --> 01:25:55,690
buildings down,
which is what you saw happening.

1624
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:56,823
They were trying to knock down the 
things the buildings were invisibly 

1625
01:25:59,681 --> 01:26:01,900
related to.
And then you might ask,

1626
01:26:01,901 --> 01:26:04,340
well,
what were those buildings related to?

1627
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:07,790
And it's a simpler question to actually 
reverse the question and say,

1628
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:09,470
well,
what weren't they related to?

1629
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:13,400
And the reason that people were 
traumatized in the aftermath was because

1630
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:14,503
when we,
when our bodies in some sense answered 

1631
01:26:17,211 --> 01:26:19,730
that question,
the answer was,

1632
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:20,983
oh,
those buildings were probably attached 

1633
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:23,744
to everything in every possible way.
And so God only knows what's going to 

1634
01:26:27,651 --> 01:26:31,130
come leaping out of that.
So what,

1635
01:26:31,131 --> 01:26:34,730
what happens when you see the buildings 
fall?

1636
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:39,530
The fact that you see the buildings fall
actually blinds you to what's happening.

1637
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:43,250
It's like as a very peripheral 
representation of the actual event,

1638
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:44,930
because you could also say,
well,

1639
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:47,150
it was a psychological event.
You know,

1640
01:26:47,151 --> 01:26:48,980
it echoed inside of you.
Well,

1641
01:26:48,981 --> 01:26:49,850
you don't see that.

1642
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:51,860
You feel it and you don't really know 
what it means,

1643
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:52,903
but it puts a wave of uncertainty,
a radical wave of uncertainty into 

1644
01:26:56,121 --> 01:26:57,740
everything.
Right.

1645
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:01,220
And not only the present,
but also the future for sure.

1646
01:27:01,221 --> 01:27:04,640
Because things took a vicious turn after
that and almost immediately,

1647
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:05,743
right.
The whole political system readjusted 

1648
01:27:06,771 --> 01:27:09,080
itself.
It became much more authoritarian.

1649
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:10,723
You know,
airports became like little fascist in 

1650
01:27:12,321 --> 01:27:13,970
enclaves.
It was for me,

1651
01:27:13,971 --> 01:27:16,580
it went for many people,
I could hardly go into an airport.

1652
01:27:16,581 --> 01:27:20,990
It just drove me crazy to be lined up 
like that and then subject to search by,

1653
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:22,340
you know,
faceless.

1654
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:25,783
What would you say?
There are faceless representations of 

1655
01:27:28,161 --> 01:27:30,290
the,
of the paranoid state.

1656
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,153
It's like God,
that's a horrible thing to have to 

1657
01:27:32,901 --> 01:27:33,734
encounter.
It's a bloody horrible thing to train 

1658
01:27:34,881 --> 01:27:38,480
people to get accustomed to.
It's really dangerous to train people to

1659
01:27:38,481 --> 01:27:41,540
accept that sort of thing.
It was a way worse consequence.

1660
01:27:41,541 --> 01:27:42,374
I think that in the,
the buildings falling down on 

1661
01:27:43,731 --> 01:27:44,780
themselves.
But,

1662
01:27:44,781 --> 01:27:47,600
so that was one thing that happened.
What else happened?

1663
01:27:47,601 --> 01:27:49,700
Well,
the 4 trillion,

1664
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:50,863
the $1 trillion surplus that was 
projected by the Clintons at the end of 

1665
01:27:55,641 --> 01:27:58,460
Bill Clinton's presidency,
which was the,

1666
01:27:58,490 --> 01:27:59,323
the prediction for the next 10 years 
that the economy was moving along so 

1667
01:28:02,541 --> 01:28:06,020
well,
that the US government was going to have

1668
01:28:06,021 --> 01:28:08,720
a $1 trillion surplus over the next 10 
years,

1669
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:13,900
turned into a $4 trillion deficit.
So that happened while,

1670
01:28:14,991 --> 01:28:17,330
and then we got tangled up,
even worse in the Middle East.

1671
01:28:17,331 --> 01:28:18,164
And of course that,
that I think is probably got worse as 

1672
01:28:21,951 --> 01:28:23,390
time's gone on rather than better.

1673
01:28:23,390 --> 01:28:25,550
And we have no idea where that's going 
to end.

1674
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:26,721
You know,
I mean,

1675
01:28:26,721 --> 01:28:27,554
Russia is involved now and Russia 
rattled nuclear weapons at Turkey the 

1676
01:28:30,411 --> 01:28:31,640
other day,
you know,

1677
01:28:31,641 --> 01:28:32,474
even though Turkeys,
their largest trading partner and a 

1678
01:28:33,891 --> 01:28:35,990
member of NATO,
you know,

1679
01:28:35,991 --> 01:28:36,824
and then you know,
a million refugees flooded into Europe 

1680
01:28:39,261 --> 01:28:41,900
and God only knows what's going to 
happen as a consequence of that.

1681
01:28:41,901 --> 01:28:45,170
It's like,
and it's not like the people who planted

1682
01:28:45,171 --> 01:28:47,840
the bomb didn't know that.
Like here's what they thought.

1683
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:50,420
They thought,
oh,

1684
01:28:50,810 --> 01:28:51,643
the Soviet Union,
that was the second greatest power on 

1685
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:53,894
earth.
And then they waited into Afghanistan 

1686
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:58,340
and they got tangled up in a terrorist 
war and how poof,

1687
01:28:58,341 --> 01:28:59,174
10 years later they didn't exist.
It's like maybe could do the same thing 

1688
01:29:01,921 --> 01:29:03,960
to the United States.
It's like,

1689
01:29:03,961 --> 01:29:07,560
well who knows?
Maybe you could.

1690
01:29:08,270 --> 01:29:13,270
I mean they certainly read their 
response to the nine 11 disaster was a,

1691
01:29:14,030 --> 01:29:14,863
in my opinion,
much more expensive than the disaster 

1692
01:29:16,711 --> 01:29:17,544
itself.

1693
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:18,913
I mean,
one of the things that's quite 

1694
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:21,263
horrifying is that here's one statistic.
Nobody flew in the aftermath of nine 11 

1695
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:27,593
for a while.
Like airplane flight bookings were way 

1696
01:29:30,311 --> 01:29:31,144
down.
More people died in car accidents 

1697
01:29:33,661 --> 01:29:36,330
because of not flying,
then were killed in the bombings.

1698
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:37,953
And no one ever noticed that cause 
people are being killed on the highway 

1699
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:40,441
all the time.
Right?

1700
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:43,050
So it's like it's background noise as 
far as we're concerned.

1701
01:29:43,051 --> 01:29:44,250
But you know,
it's,

1702
01:29:44,251 --> 01:29:48,360
it's a really good example of how not 
only do you know what the event,

1703
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:49,253
not know what the event is,
you can't even tell who the event 

1704
01:29:51,301 --> 01:29:52,134
killed.
And so it's your apprehension of that 

1705
01:29:56,340 --> 01:30:00,420
when it occurs that paralyzes you.
And that's the dragon of chaos,

1706
01:30:00,421 --> 01:30:02,490
roughly speaking.
That's an unknown unknown.

1707
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:03,773
It's like all of reality,
all of the multiple levels of reality 

1708
01:30:07,351 --> 01:30:08,184
that exists around you are all of a 
sudden altered in an incomprehensible 

1709
01:30:12,061 --> 01:30:12,894
manner.

1710
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:14,250
And then you could say that,
well,

1711
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:18,360
what happened was the alteration of that
reality,

1712
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:19,673
that is what happened.
It's that you can only perceive it 

1713
01:30:22,111 --> 01:30:26,340
essentially as the explosion in the 
building and the consequent collapse.

1714
01:30:26,341 --> 01:30:28,230
And so you might say that,
well the nine,

1715
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,810
you know,
the trick twin towers were brought down.

1716
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:34,710
It's like that's such a low resolution 
representation of what happened,

1717
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:39,630
that it barely begins to describe that 
event.

1718
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:45,800
And so it's that invisible background of
complex interrelationships,

1719
01:30:45,841 --> 01:30:46,674
like a very,
very complex melody that's always going 

1720
01:30:48,781 --> 01:30:50,850
on around you.
And as long as it works,

1721
01:30:50,851 --> 01:30:51,684
you don't even notice it.
What happens is it manifests itself as 

1722
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:59,000
predictable and desirable order,
which you can understand,

1723
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,290
which is the reason we have predictable 
and desirable.

1724
01:31:01,291 --> 01:31:02,124
Our order.
This room is configured so that you can 

1725
01:31:04,261 --> 01:31:05,094
walk into it without being afraid.
And what that means is that it's a 

1726
01:31:08,101 --> 01:31:10,680
radically simplified version of reality.

1727
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:12,510
You know,
and you can see that.

1728
01:31:12,511 --> 01:31:14,400
I mean,
it's even got padded walls,

1729
01:31:14,401 --> 01:31:17,190
you know,
and that's to stop the sound bouncing so

1730
01:31:17,191 --> 01:31:18,520
that it won't annoy you.
You know?

1731
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:20,100
I mean,
it's warm,

1732
01:31:20,101 --> 01:31:21,420
it's comfortable,
it's,

1733
01:31:21,421 --> 01:31:24,060
it's sort of neutral.
So it fades into the background.

1734
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:26,520
Everyone here is civilized beyond 
belief.

1735
01:31:26,910 --> 01:31:27,940
You know,
you,

1736
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:30,780
you hear about the radical individualism
up the west.

1737
01:31:30,781 --> 01:31:31,614
I think I'm the,
of all the nonsense I've ever heard 

1738
01:31:33,091 --> 01:31:36,130
that's gotta to be the most nonsensical 
were so bloody obedient that it's,

1739
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:37,123
it's insane.
If you go to Edmonton at three o'clock 

1740
01:31:40,201 --> 01:31:41,034
in the morning and watch pedestrians,
they will stop at the don't walk light 

1741
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:49,580
and wait until it turns green.
Now the roads are wide and so they,

1742
01:31:49,591 --> 01:31:51,030
you know,
but it's still the case.

1743
01:31:51,031 --> 01:31:52,410
It's like,
really?

1744
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:55,380
How's it?
How's you think you're an individual?

1745
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,660
Really?
It's like I'm not complaining about it.

1746
01:31:57,660 --> 01:31:58,493
I think it's an amazing thing because 
you know we can really zip cars to our 

1747
01:32:00,671 --> 01:32:01,504
cities because people don't run out into
the middle of the streets and get 

1748
01:32:04,181 --> 01:32:05,014
killed.
They stay where they're supposed to and 

1749
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:07,053
so it's incredibly efficient,
but we're so being well behaved that 

1750
01:32:10,511 --> 01:32:12,840
it's just,
it's beyond you.

1751
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:15,940
If you think about us as chimpanzees 
with clothes,

1752
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:17,103
you know we're doing pretty damn well 
and we set up our environment so that 

1753
01:32:20,261 --> 01:32:21,094
they're so simplified that we never have
to encounter this multi dimensional 

1754
01:32:25,630 --> 01:32:29,920
layered reality of patterns that's just 
moving around,

1755
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:34,240
moving around us all the time and that 
actually makes up reality.

1756
01:32:34,570 --> 01:32:36,040
That's reality.
That's what,

1757
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:36,993
that's what the world is made out of.
That's a way different way of thinking 

1758
01:32:39,611 --> 01:32:41,470
about it.
Then to think about the world is made up

1759
01:32:41,471 --> 01:32:43,690
say of Adams,
because you think that way,

1760
01:32:43,691 --> 01:32:44,620
you just think,
well,

1761
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:47,410
it's sort of,
it's like marbles in space,

1762
01:32:47,411 --> 01:32:48,640
you know,
and,

1763
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:49,803
and of course Adam's ours marbles and 
everyone knows that and god only knows 

1764
01:32:53,231 --> 01:32:53,740
what they are.

1765
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:57,280
But that's still the image.
That's the metaphor of reality.

1766
01:32:57,700 --> 01:33:02,700
But that's not what reality is.
It's an insanely pattern orchestra of,

1767
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:07,360
of phenomenon.
And that's really what it is.

1768
01:33:07,361 --> 01:33:08,194
And then if what happens is that you're 
in this little orderly sub compartment 

1769
01:33:12,041 --> 01:33:14,200
in the middle of it,
it's like you're in a box and the box is

1770
01:33:14,201 --> 01:33:15,650
inside a box.
Well let's think about it.

1771
01:33:15,970 --> 01:33:17,530
You're in a box.
Okay,

1772
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:19,780
this box is in the building.
That's a box.

1773
01:33:20,290 --> 01:33:22,600
The building is in the university.
That's a box.

1774
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:24,790
The universities in the city,
that's a box.

1775
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:26,800
The city is in,
in the province.

1776
01:33:26,950 --> 01:33:27,783
That's a box that it's in Canada.
Then it's covered by the American 

1777
01:33:31,031 --> 01:33:32,260
nuclear umbrella,
you know?

1778
01:33:32,261 --> 01:33:33,094
And then it's embedded in this immense 
history of individual rights and 

1779
01:33:36,341 --> 01:33:37,174
freedoms that have manifested themselves
as part of the political and economic 

1780
01:33:40,151 --> 01:33:40,984
order.
And all of that's going on around you 

1781
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:48,370
and people are working like mad crazily 
to keep all of those boxes intact.

1782
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:52,930
And here you are sitting and thinking,
well what you see around you is reality.

1783
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:54,130
It's like it is.
Yeah,

1784
01:33:54,131 --> 01:33:54,964
but man,
there is a lot of people making that 

1785
01:33:57,401 --> 01:34:00,550
this reality so simple that you don't 
have to think about it.

1786
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:03,160
You can come in here and think about 
ideas,

1787
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:04,653
you know,
for like hours at a time and like you 

1788
01:34:06,881 --> 01:34:09,580
don't get eaten by a crocodile.
It's really,

1789
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:10,473
and you know,
no one comes running through here 

1790
01:34:11,831 --> 01:34:12,664
pillaging,
which is of course the crocodile eating 

1791
01:34:15,491 --> 01:34:16,324
and the pillaging were very,
very common occurrences in our 

1792
01:34:18,581 --> 01:34:19,980
evolutionary history.
You know,

1793
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:20,833
I mean for lots of our ancestors going 
down to get water from the local river 

1794
01:34:23,711 --> 01:34:27,220
was a life or death mission.
You know?

1795
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:29,650
I mean,
I can't imagine having to get water from

1796
01:34:29,651 --> 01:34:30,484
a crocodile infested stream,
especially when that's where the lions 

1797
01:34:33,551 --> 01:34:34,930
are hanging out too,
you know?

1798
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:39,370
So that's ordered.
That's the positive element of order.

1799
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:41,560
Now you can say,
students say this a lot.

1800
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:42,423
Oh my God,
I'm so constrained within all these 

1801
01:34:43,691 --> 01:34:46,330
boxes,
it's destroying my individuality.

1802
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:48,340
You know?
And that's the tear radical.

1803
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:49,530
I mean it's,
it's,

1804
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,920
it's pathetic in some sense because God,
you know,

1805
01:34:51,921 --> 01:34:54,760
and you're so privileged,
it's just beyond comprehension.

1806
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:55,900
But,
but,

1807
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:58,720
but having said that,
it is also the case and,

1808
01:34:58,721 --> 01:34:59,550
and it's,
it has,

1809
01:34:59,550 --> 01:35:00,383
the case has to be made that you,
you do have to sacrifice your potential 

1810
01:35:04,730 --> 01:35:08,090
to cultural norms.
And that is it.

1811
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:12,020
You can argue that that's destructive.
And sometimes it really is disruptive.

1812
01:35:12,021 --> 01:35:14,840
Like creative people don't fit very well
into nested boxes.

1813
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:15,973
And in order for them to fit,
they have to do damage in some sense to 

1814
01:35:18,561 --> 01:35:22,220
their psyches because they're not 
naturally

1815
01:35:24,910 --> 01:35:25,743
made to,
that isn't their natural environment 

1816
01:35:27,881 --> 01:35:30,430
boxes within boxes.
And so they might say,

1817
01:35:30,431 --> 01:35:31,600
well,
I'm being oppressed.

1818
01:35:31,601 --> 01:35:32,141
And it's like,
well,

1819
01:35:32,141 --> 01:35:35,470
of course you're being oppressed.
It's like if you're in 50 boxes,

1820
01:35:35,471 --> 01:35:37,960
that's going to constrain your freedoms,
freedom of movement.

1821
01:35:37,961 --> 01:35:38,794
But maybe you should be somewhat 
grateful for the fact that the box is 

1822
01:35:40,781 --> 01:35:42,040
exist.
You think,

1823
01:35:42,041 --> 01:35:43,150
well,
you don't even notice them.

1824
01:35:43,570 --> 01:35:47,410
The boxes are so effective that you,
you don't even notice them.

1825
01:35:47,411 --> 01:35:50,170
You can even criticize them and and you 
should,

1826
01:35:50,350 --> 01:35:51,183
you don't because maybe they could be 
better and not quite as rigid and so 

1827
01:35:53,471 --> 01:35:54,304
forth.
And you know the criticism is the 

1828
01:35:57,521 --> 01:36:00,280
criticism is justified but you have to 
keep both of the,

1829
01:36:01,330 --> 01:36:04,480
both of the representations in mind at 
the same time.

1830
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:05,793
You know,
your culture is the wise king and the 

1831
01:36:07,151 --> 01:36:10,600
desk bought at the same time and people 
hate that sort of thing because,

1832
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:15,340
and you know our rational minds and our 
logical and our,

1833
01:36:15,341 --> 01:36:16,174
our,
our history of logical intellectual 

1834
01:36:17,951 --> 01:36:18,784
thinking has forced us to assume that a 
thing can't be itself and its opposite 

1835
01:36:23,051 --> 01:36:23,980
at the same time.

1836
01:36:24,490 --> 01:36:27,760
But unfortunately when you're talking 
about very large scale categories,

1837
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:29,493
things are there,
what they are and they're opposite at 

1838
01:36:31,601 --> 01:36:32,434
the same time because culture is the 
wise king and the tyrant and that means 

1839
01:36:36,371 --> 01:36:37,204
it's very difficult to adjust your 
behavior in relationship to it because 

1840
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:43,480
you never know if you're talking to the 
wise king or the tyrant,

1841
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:46,940
you know and you'll feel that if you do 
your taxes or if you have to deal with,

1842
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:49,810
say you have to deal with the university
bureaucracy in some way.

1843
01:36:49,811 --> 01:36:50,644
It's like you know you're a number and 
you know you're just annoying like 

1844
01:36:53,861 --> 01:36:54,694
patients in a hospital because hospitals
would read a lot better if they didn't 

1845
01:36:57,401 --> 01:37:00,550
have any patients in them.
Obviously you know when you feel that of

1846
01:37:00,551 --> 01:37:01,384
course whenever you're in a very complex
bureaucracy it's like you're 

1847
01:37:03,910 --> 01:37:07,450
exchangeable and that's very annoying.
But by the same token,

1848
01:37:07,451 --> 01:37:10,180
while here you are,
so you have to criticize,

1849
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:13,060
this is also a very complex form of 
moral behavior.

1850
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:14,343
You have to criticize with gratitude.
And that's something that students 

1851
01:37:19,121 --> 01:37:21,070
should really be taught in university,
you know,

1852
01:37:21,071 --> 01:37:24,130
because the opposite of gratitude is 
resentment.

1853
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:28,180
And there is nothing that's more 
pathological than resentment.

1854
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:29,193
The only thing that comes close to 
resentment in terms of its capacity to 

1855
01:37:32,471 --> 01:37:35,380
produce misery is arrogance.
And those things are often,

1856
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:37,750
it's arrogance,
resentment,

1857
01:37:37,751 --> 01:37:40,300
and deceit,
and it's like that's the evil triad.

1858
01:37:40,301 --> 01:37:42,550
You get all those three things going in 
your life,

1859
01:37:42,551 --> 01:37:44,950
and boy,
you're going to be in rough shape very,

1860
01:37:44,951 --> 01:37:48,130
very rapidly.
So then

1861
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:53,410
let's take a break
for 15 minutes,

1862
01:37:53,411 --> 01:37:54,244
okay.
