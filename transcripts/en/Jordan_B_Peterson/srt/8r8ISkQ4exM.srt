1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,090
Psychoanalytic thought today.
Depth psychology.

2
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:08,160
That's a better way to think about
psychoanalysis.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,770
Freud.
Freud is not the only contributor to the

4
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:18,300
Corpus of psychoanalytic ideas.
Adler who we won't talk much about

5
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,920
was certainly that there was smart and
he's a,

6
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:24,480
he's under,
he's underrated.

7
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:26,920
Today,
wasn't as charismatic as Freud and you

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,170
know,
so,

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,280
and he didn't have the same flare for
writing I suppose.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,120
But he,
his ideas foreshadow the development of

11
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:37,290
leaders,
cybernetic ideas,

12
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:40,430
which we'll talk about by a good margin.
So add,

13
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:43,200
they're really had some,
some smart things to say.

14
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,740
Um,
Yoni is the first one we're going to

15
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:51,140
talk about day and next time I'm going
to talk about him in some ways

16
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,890
indirectly because the best way to
understand healing is to show you what

17
00:00:55,891 --> 00:01:00,030
you do with his ideas rather than really
presenting the ideas themselves.

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,520
But I can give you a bit of an overview.

19
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,630
So
one of the things that differentiates

20
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:14,220
the depths psychologists from say
behavior therapists and even from

21
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:18,950
cognitive scientists,
is that you might say in one way they're

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,350
more mystical,
which means more from the romantic

23
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:26,070
tradition.
Then the cognitive scientists in the

24
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:29,190
behaviorists.
So there's a temperamental split their

25
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:31,500
aid,
because people who are high in openness

26
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:33,810
and both Freud and young were very,
very high in trade.

27
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:38,811
Openness are very interested in the
domain of the imagination and the domain

28
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:43,800
of fantasy because they have very active
imaginations and they have very active

29
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:45,660
fantasy lights and they're good
visualizers.

30
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:47,120
And so,
um,

31
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,160
one of the things I've noticed in my
clinical practice,

32
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,760
there's always been a joke about depth
psychologists that if you go see a

33
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,490
Friday and you have Freud and dreams,
and if you go see a union,

34
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,980
you have union dreams.
And I suppose that means if you go to a

35
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:01,140
behavioral therapist that you don't have
any dreams at all.

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,700
But I actually think there's some truth
in that because the more pragmatic

37
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:10,280
people that more practical people are
not going to be attractive to therapists

38
00:02:10,281 --> 00:02:14,910
who deal with issues that have to do say
with the imagination and fantasy.

39
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,940
And so there's a natural parsing.
And one of the things I've noticed in my

40
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:22,941
clinical practice is that
imagine that that people,

41
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:25,500
so those would be open and creative
people,

42
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,410
um,
have a dream life.

43
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,640
That big cries out to be interpreted in
architectural terms.

44
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:35,190
Like I've had clients number of them
now,

45
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,640
I have one right now.
I mean it's,

46
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,890
it's his dream life is,
is it's so remote.

47
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,650
It's so rich.
It's remarkable.

48
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:45,450
And he's,
if he's a genius dreamer,

49
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:48,090
every time he comes in and it's like he
has two dreams or three dreams,

50
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,180
they're coherent,
they're complex sleep plotted,

51
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,160
they're interesting and,
and they chart what's going on in his

52
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:57,990
life and they tell him what he should
do.

53
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,620
It's like it's,
it's great.

54
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,780
It's,
but everyone is like that.

55
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,880
I also have clients who never dreamed at
all.

56
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,060
And then I've also seen when I've
lectured to people,

57
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,690
I see this most particularly in medical
students cause I've lectured a bit to

58
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,870
medical students is like,
so maybe I'll do a seminar for the,

59
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,020
for the medical students and tell them a
little bit about the symbols of

60
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:19,990
transformation really because they're
involved in,

61
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,260
first of all transforming because their
medical students and so you have to

62
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:26,320
transform it into a doctor.
And also of course they're helping

63
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,210
people through transformations all the
time,

64
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,830
often negative but not always soft,
sometimes positive because sometimes you

65
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:36,520
get better.
And so it's useful possibly for them to

66
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:41,350
understand those processes or deeply.
Generally with the medical school

67
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,850
students I do half lecture that's more
on like trade psychology,

68
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:48,820
the more behavioral and half of it on
the more symbolic stuff,

69
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:50,610
which is kind of like this class is.

70
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,800
Um,
and there's always about half the

71
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:58,060
medical students on whom the more
symbolic stuff just falls flat.

72
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,250
It just,
they just don't,

73
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,800
it's like talking about color that
people who are coming are blind.

74
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:03,851
And I,
I've,

75
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:07,520
I've thought about this a lot and I
really do think it's face to

76
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:09,700
temperamental differences.
So you don't,

77
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:12,760
if you have an active fantasy life and
you have Mac and imagination and you're

78
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:17,761
a good visualizer and you dream a lot,
then that's the sort of person you are.

79
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,210
And if you,
and if you're on the other end of the

80
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:23,620
scale,
which would be that you're very

81
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:25,210
conscientious,
let's say,

82
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,210
and very low in openness,
which also tends to make you more

83
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:30,820
conservative in your political
presuppositions.

84
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:34,030
By the way,
then dream analysis is probably not for

85
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:36,940
you,
partly because you're just not going to

86
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:38,200
come up with that many dreams.

87
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,850
And even if they,
even if you do,

88
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:45,270
they won't necessarily be informative.
So you know,

89
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:49,240
there's been a very long battle in some
ways in the psychological and

90
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:52,840
psychiatric community between people who
take different perspectives on how you

91
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:55,810
might address psychological problems.
But I don't know if the,

92
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,200
the issue of tight has been thought
about seriously enough in that regard

93
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,980
because we're really only just starting
to understand the dimensions,

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,060
the actual dimensions of personality
property,

95
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:09,850
and to figure out what it means to be on
one end of say,

96
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:13,540
openness and versus the other way.
Especially if you're intelligent,

97
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,070
you can be intelligent,
not open.

98
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,340
Those are complicated people.
They got very analytical minds to make

99
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:20,740
good lawyers.
Like lawyers are often,

100
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,800
and this is something you might think
about if you're planning to become a

101
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:24,920
lawyer.
Um,

102
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,430
if you're high in openness,
it's a bad job for you.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,690
You will not be happy.
You need to be really conscientious,

104
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,400
like off the scale.
And it helps to be disagreeable to so

105
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:39,730
because if you're too agreeable,
well you're supposed to weigh in if

106
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:42,610
you're a lawyer.
And I supposed to like nicely let the

107
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:45,370
other person,
when you know you're supposed to fight

108
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:47,740
to win.
And so you have to be kind of fighting

109
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:49,900
to do that.
And if you're high in agreeableness than

110
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:52,690
it's a job that's kind of grates against
your temperament.

111
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,560
So anyways,
so young

112
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,880
you work you,
and I think the best way to think about

113
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:03,680
yoga is that he was a student of two
people.

114
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:07,340
He was a student of Friedrich Nietzsche
and who was a student of Freud.

115
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,270
And although the Friday ends,
when they write the history of

116
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:16,160
psychoanalytic thought,
they pretty much portray young is up as

117
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:17,750
like a derivative thinker of Freud.

118
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,850
Um,
it's not the right way to think about is

119
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,130
positioning historically because in some
ways what,

120
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,350
what young was trying to do was to
answer the question that needs opposed

121
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,320
at the end of the 19th century because,
and the reason that no one was trying to

122
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:37,910
answer it was because he believed it was
the most important question that had

123
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:39,740
been posed at the end of the 19th
century.

124
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:41,090
And that was,
you know,

125
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:42,620
there's a famous quote by nature,
right?

126
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,210
Done.
I'm sure you've all heard it and that's

127
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:45,780
the boat that God is dead.
So,

128
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,880
but needs just said essentially was God
is dead and we have killed him.

129
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,380
That's a different idea and we'll never
find enough water to wash away the

130
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:57,440
blood.
And so it wasn't like a triumphal state,

131
00:06:57,441 --> 00:07:00,410
but on each as part,
even though when you hear it quoted,

132
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,060
you always hear it quoted that way.

133
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,090
It's like it's a sort of victory
daughter,

134
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:04,671
her dad,
you know,

135
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:07,400
or something to celebrate.
It's not what nature thought at all.

136
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,230
In fact,
he thought all hell was going to break

137
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:13,800
loose because of it.
And he predicted as much like in the,

138
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,750
in the,
in the 1870 [inaudible].

139
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,900
I mean he predicted what was going to
happen in the 20th century with re it's

140
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,230
ridiculous accuracy,
like uncanny.

141
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,170
And that's part of it because you know,
nature was one of these people like

142
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:27,890
young who are very grounded in their
deep,

143
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:31,400
deep,
deep imaginations and so they get wind

144
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:35,210
of the currents that are moving through
society long before normal people do.

145
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,800
So in some sense,
you know,

146
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:39,350
you can imagine that in any given
population,

147
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,020
even within you guys,
there's some of you guys who were living

148
00:07:42,021 --> 00:07:44,870
in like 50 years ago and there's some of
you living now and there's somebody that

149
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:46,280
you live in 50 years in the future.

150
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,540
It depends on how intelligent,
imaginative versus how conservative you

151
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,420
are.
Cause it's not like everyone develops at

152
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:56,870
exactly the same historical rate.
And you get people like Nicha for

153
00:07:56,871 --> 00:07:58,010
example,
or dusty Yefsky,

154
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,930
they're like a hundred years ahead of
everyone else.

155
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:02,240
And so you know,
people don't even know what to do with

156
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:05,060
them.
But stendhal was like that too though.

157
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:08,210
The writer,
he wrote the 1830s and he was convinced

158
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:09,920
that he was a hundred years ahead of his
time.

159
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,230
And stylistically that was probably
about right.

160
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,350
So,
and the people who are profits regarded

161
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:18,170
as profits in isn't say old testament
tradition.

162
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:20,630
They were the same sort of people.
It's like they had their ear to the

163
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:25,160
ground in a sense and they could tell
what was going on underneath everybody's

164
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:27,440
facade.
It echoed in them.

165
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:31,130
And often as the stories go,
and I'm sure they have,

166
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,710
they have a mythological accuracy to
them.

167
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:39,080
The people who are picking up the
underground currency indicating often

168
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:43,490
catastrophe felt absolutely compelled
even at the risk of their own skin to

169
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:45,410
warn people.
So,

170
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,080
so navy,
so young was definitely one of these

171
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:50,810
people.
And now this question,

172
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:56,050
God is dead and we have killed him.
Led me to pose another question,

173
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:57,420
which was,
well,

174
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:01,380
what are we going to do to replace him?
Because need to believe.

175
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,810
And I think it,
I think he was absolutely right about

176
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,730
this.
I can't see how it could be otherwise.

177
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,160
He believed that the morality that it's
structured,

178
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:13,161
Western society was predicated on the
fundamental axiom of divinity.

179
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,140
And so like the,
as far as nature was concerned,

180
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,980
the whole Corpus of morality was
dependent on there on that,

181
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,190
that axiom being true or at least being
accepted as true.

182
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,110
And when that accident was knocked out
by saying that conflict between science

183
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:30,090
and religion,
because in some sense that's what did

184
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:30,540
it.

185
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,470
Then the whole system no longer had
anything to stand on and could become

186
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:38,310
entirely questionable.
And so Nicha pointed that out.

187
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,520
And then Dostoyevsky who was writing
basically at the same time said,

188
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,040
well,
if there's no god than anything is

189
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,580
permitted.
And what he meant by that was really,

190
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:51,270
in some sense,
what he meant by that was morality turns

191
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:56,271
into what what you can get away with
because there's nothing final about it.

192
00:09:56,761 --> 00:10:01,230
There's nothing transcendent about it.
And like we've played these problem own

193
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,060
intellectually.
You guys are still right in the middle

194
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,680
of this battle,
whether you know it or not.

195
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,530
I mean,
so what happened in the 20th century was

196
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:12,531
that one of the consequences of that
loss of an UN fundamental underpinning

197
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,650
led Europe to swing radically to
political extremes.

198
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,500
You know,
the Nazis were to think of that,

199
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,130
to think of the Nazis without thinking
of that as it religious transformation

200
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:24,690
is that's just not right.

201
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,600
It was religious transformation and it
wasn't a good one.

202
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,500
So like it was a regression in some
sense too,

203
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:32,640
to a morality that was way pre
Christian.

204
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,110
Like you said,
it wasn't not good.

205
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,780
And then you know,
you had the same,

206
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,410
it was like the rise of the state as an
alternative to God.

207
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:44,460
Well we s we saw what that produced.
It produced hundreds of millions of

208
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:47,430
painful deaths and it just about
destroyed the world.

209
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,460
So it was a,
it was a bad problem.

210
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,770
And you know,
when we sort of skirted our way through

211
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:55,200
that miraculously,
you know,

212
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,200
that all,
I don't really think World War II came

213
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:02,250
to an end until 1980 1989 you know,
because there was the whole cold war

214
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:04,950
period after,
after the Germans and the Japanese had

215
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:08,160
surrendered.
But I mean we just went from one war to

216
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:10,410
another.
We just went to another one that

217
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:12,120
everyone was too afraid to fight.

218
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,490
It was still a war,
you know?

219
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:18,780
And that didn't end until 1989 first by
some miracle,

220
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,790
God only knows why,
you know,

221
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:24,210
it never degenerated into a
thermonuclear exchange and then it was

222
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:25,044
close,
man,

223
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,970
we just barely squeaked through that.
There is,

224
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:32,210
there were two times during that period,
one in 1964 during the Cuban missile

225
00:11:33,031 --> 00:11:36,360
crisis where they had those buddy icbm
is primed.

226
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,780
And so the way they work with in the
control panel,

227
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:44,550
which kind of looked like a star trek,
you know the old star Trek sets,

228
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,480
there'd be like a panel here and there
was a little place you can put a key and

229
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,160
about 20 feet over there and there'd be
another guy with a key.

230
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,920
And if he turned his key and held it for
10 seconds at the same time,

231
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:59,050
he turned his key and held it for 10
seconds.

232
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:03,410
Then the missile launched and an
intercontinental ballistic missile is a

233
00:12:03,411 --> 00:12:07,540
bullet and I mean that technically it's
not a guided missile.

234
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,970
Once you launch it like you,
you shoot a bullet,

235
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,040
it's gone and you don't get to tell the
bullet to come back.

236
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,860
Once it's gone,
you can turn around like a cruise

237
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:17,110
missile,
an intercontinental ballistic missile.

238
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,530
It goes where you aimed it and you don't
get to bring it back.

239
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:25,180
And so during the Cuban missile crisis,
the keys were in the locks.

240
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,800
So we were 10 seconds away,
man,

241
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:31,370
I tell you that,
that was a tight keyhole.

242
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:36,420
We've barely squeaked through that wall
and looks like by about 1989 then that

243
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,450
collective consciousness or human would
say the collective unconscious of the

244
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:45,070
human race had decided that,
well maybe having it all end in like

245
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:49,960
apocalyptic annihilation and wasn't
necessarily for the best.

246
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,640
It's interesting because writers like
girth f he wrote Faust and faust as this

247
00:12:57,641 --> 00:13:02,440
tale of a man who makes a bet with the
devil so that he can acquire infinite

248
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:06,420
knowledge essentially.
And the devil in faust is named

249
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:11,421
Mephistopheles and dirt that was trying
to explain what human evil,

250
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,210
evil per se,
what it's motive was.

251
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,240
And he did a lovely job.
It's so smart what he said and he said,

252
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:22,030
the devil is basic hypothesis and of
course spirit,

253
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:27,031
the expresses this and poetry is that
life is so unbearably cruel and random

254
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:32,590
and tragic that it would be better if it
had never existed at all.

255
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,380
And you know,
you believe me,

256
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,290
there'll be times in your life where you
think that you know where something has

257
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,530
just knocked you off your feet
completely on,

258
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,440
on just manner,
you know,

259
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,600
and that thought it will rise up.

260
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,840
And like it's a compelling thought.
And I think that's the thought that he

261
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:53,080
would means we're wrestling with,
well we've been wrestling with it

262
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:56,140
forever,
but we didn't really vote on it until

263
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:59,620
1989 you know,
and life barely one.

264
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:02,110
And you know,
life isn't troublesome businesses.

265
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,180
It's a tragedy.
And you know,

266
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,080
everyone asks himself now and then is if
their consciousness is worth the pain

267
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,630
while the answer that is,
it depends on how you live.

268
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,710
That is the answer to that.
But you know,

269
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,340
that's a complicated answer.
And just because you know that answer,

270
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:21,460
it doesn't mean that you know how to
live anyways.

271
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,550
What's happened since 1989 as far as I'm
concerned,

272
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:28,510
is that intellectuals who were often
possessed by the worst sorts of demons

273
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,870
because they actually think that their
intelligence can guide the property in,

274
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,150
in,
in like the complex moral landscape.

275
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,360
It's not the case.
You see most intellectuals,

276
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:40,770
and this is certainly a case of most
intellectuals in the universities in

277
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,340
the,
especially in the late 20th century,

278
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,720
they were committed marxists like way
past wouldn't intuitively,

279
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,500
you know,
George Orwell,

280
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:50,860
by 1955 he was a left winger,
brilliant guy.

281
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,850
He'd already figured out that whatever
was going on in the Soviet Union was not

282
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,110
good.
So,

283
00:14:57,111 --> 00:14:58,670
you know,
like if you had your eyes open,

284
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,000
you were done with that by you know,
10 years after World War II.

285
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:05,720
But people like Sean Paul Sartre were
members of the Communist Party way

286
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:08,900
longer than they had any ethical right
whatsoever to be.

287
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:09,950
You know,
it's,

288
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,310
was it absolutely murderous philosophy
and,

289
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:15,530
but,
but intellectuals toyed with that,

290
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:17,360
they still toy with it.
And the universities,

291
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:19,510
you know,
except it's turned into postmodernism,

292
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,870
which has Marxism under a new guys,
you know,

293
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:27,871
and a lot of the postmodern thought is
not only left wing disguised,

294
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,410
but it's also nihilistic.

295
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,800
And that's actually the other problem
that the death of God produces.

296
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:34,760
One is,
okay,

297
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,460
I,
I don't have a religious foundation.

298
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,390
I don't have any foundation under my
feet to buttress my moral claims or even

299
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:46,010
to sort of help me determine what life
is worth in the face of tragedy.

300
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,560
So I need something to replace that.
And then Poof,

301
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:51,950
that's the state,
which is a really bad replacement cause

302
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,410
if you think God's bad,
like you just try stellan on for try it

303
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,010
on for size for a while.
And Mao as well,

304
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,840
you know,
and Hitler as well.

305
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:04,841
It's not like this was a phenomena that
was only linked to one say culture of

306
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:07,160
people.
Everybody became susceptible to it.

307
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:10,610
And the same murderous thing happened
every time people try that.

308
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,920
So it was China,
Cambodia,

309
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,500
Vietnam,
like wherever the communists got into

310
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:18,500
power man pit people died by the
hundreds of thousands.

311
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,160
So Paul Paul,
the guy who emptied the Cambodian cities

312
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:23,930
had killed 7 million.
Sorry,

313
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,750
I think it was 3 million people.
He got his,

314
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,340
he got his graduate degree at the
Sorbonne in France and he said what he

315
00:16:31,341 --> 00:16:33,350
was going to do when he went back to
Cambodia.

316
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,760
You know,
he didn't outline the whole

317
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,850
murderousness element,
but he certainly had all the theory laid

318
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:40,820
down in his fine French academy.
So,

319
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,190
you know,
we missed with ideas in the universities

320
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,830
and if we don't do it properly,
like people die.

321
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,860
It's important to get your ideas right.
So one answer to the death of God is

322
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
worshiped,
worship the state,

323
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,710
the other is doership nothing.
It's,

324
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,920
it's nihilism.
There's no distinction between anything

325
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,190
and everything is pointless.
And there,

326
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:05,230
there's a massive strain of that sort of
underground theorizing in postmodernism

327
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,000
and a psychoanalyst,
especially a union,

328
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:13,001
would look at the postmodern response,
which is nihilistic and the fascist

329
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:17,030
response,
which is sort of recourse to the state

330
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,640
as motivated by something even deeper
than that.

331
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,880
And that's the sort of process that
Nisha was describing now for young is he

332
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,810
wrote a book called Ion,
for example.

333
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:28,820
And if you want to have nightmares for
the rest of your life,

334
00:17:28,821 --> 00:17:31,680
that's a really good book to read.
I mean it's,

335
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,790
it's that book just terrified me because
young,

336
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,860
what he did in that book basically was
investigate the fantasy that he believed

337
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:44,420
that all of Western civilization had
been predicated on for the last 4,000

338
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:48,920
years now because you really believed
that what drove human beings,

339
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,160
and it's a Piagetian perspective,
it's some weird ways was the revelation

340
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:00,020
of the success of unconscious revelation
of fantasies were at the forefront of

341
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:05,610
our movement into unknown territory.
So it's like there's unknown territory

342
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,510
and then there is known territory,
but there's this weird intermediaries

343
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:13,800
space between them and that intermediary
space where you kind of know but kind of

344
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,580
don't know.

345
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,580
That's where your imagination place.
And of course that's the case,

346
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:19,470
right?
Because when you encounter something and

347
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:21,020
you don't really don't know much about
it,

348
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,690
you imagine what it might be.
And so it takes on the structures of

349
00:18:24,691 --> 00:18:27,570
your imagination.
And so in some sense what you're dealing

350
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:31,020
with as you move through history,
you expand your domain of knowledge into

351
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:35,310
the unknown is you encounter your own
front of the seat anyways,

352
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,130
if you want to do about that,
you could read like volume nine and

353
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,840
nine,
nine one and nine,

354
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:43,470
two of you once called archetypes of the
collective unconscious and the other's

355
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:46,530
called ion.
But like it'll take you a while to crack

356
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:47,850
that.
We have to beat your head against those

357
00:18:47,851 --> 00:18:51,270
folks quite a bit because what,
what young is outlining in some sense,

358
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,810
so shocking.
It's almost impossible to grasp once you

359
00:18:54,811 --> 00:18:55,710
get the picture.

360
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,010
All of a sudden things flipped around
because you understand what he's talking

361
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:00,130
about.
But before then,

362
00:19:00,131 --> 00:19:00,481
man,
it's,

363
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:01,770
it's,
it's tough going.

364
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,700
It's funny because you who has been,
um,

365
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:09,410
there was a guy named Richard Nole who
wrote a biography of yoga.

366
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,990
He was a jealous guy.
I think he was crooked too,

367
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:17,991
because
his book was called the area in Christ

368
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:22,560
and he used like Nazi imagery on the
cover and it was his publisher that

369
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,900
talked him into doing that because he
thought the book would sell more.

370
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,540
It's like,
you don't do that well,

371
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,690
or if you do,
that indicates really what you're up to,

372
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,220
right?
Because of the,

373
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,220
because of what you're willing to allow
to happen to your work.

374
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,410
So anybody who would have thought about
that wouldn't have used Nazi imagery to

375
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:44,310
gain economic utility out of writing a
criticism of young,

376
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,930
because it's,
it's,

377
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,380
it's a crooked maneuver.

378
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,410
So then you have to think,
okay,

379
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:50,370
what's,
what's he up to?

380
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,430
Why is he doing this now?
Youngest being sold,

381
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:54,690
he accused you in,
for example,

382
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:58,260
of basically starting a cult.
And I can understand that.

383
00:19:58,261 --> 00:20:02,820
But what I found so amusing about Noah's
book is that what Yoga was actually up

384
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:07,821
to was so much more,
so much more terrifying than a mere

385
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:12,030
cult.
And it was sort of like accusing a,

386
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,880
uh,
like a serial killer of stealing a loaf

387
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:15,810
of bread.
It's like,

388
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:17,370
yeah,
well maybe he stole a loaf of bread,

389
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:19,440
but compared to what he was actually up
to,

390
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:21,000
it's,
it's really not relevant.

391
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,520
So I mean,
Ewan was trying to bring the primordial

392
00:20:26,521 --> 00:20:30,690
imagination back into the world and to
make people conscious of it,

393
00:20:30,691 --> 00:20:32,110
just like,
whew,

394
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,750
that's something that really,
that's really something.

395
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:41,220
So that reading,
I read everything you wrote except the

396
00:20:41,221 --> 00:20:45,270
books that were published after his
collected works.

397
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,540
I read some of those.
It took me a long time and it just tore

398
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,430
me into bed.
Like I didn't know what the hell,

399
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,890
which way was up.
Halfway through those books,

400
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,660
I mean,
niche is bad enough because Nietzsche

401
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,710
will set out to destroy your
presuppositions.

402
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,600
In fact,
I have a client right now who's being

403
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:05,440
left late,
depressed for five years because he

404
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:07,830
wasn't particularly educated and he,
you know,

405
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,540
he started reading nature and he had
been a Christian and he thought,

406
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,591
well,
I'm a Christian.

407
00:21:11,591 --> 00:21:13,360
I can take on each end.
It's like,

408
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,253
no,
you can't.

409
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,520
No,
you can't like leach.

410
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,650
Who was so smart that it's just,
it's mind boggling.

411
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:25,360
He,
he came up with the best narcissistic

412
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:27,490
statement,
I think that's ever been written.

413
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,790
And this is when he was like,
cause he,

414
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,920
he was very sick man and he could only
great for very short periods of time.

415
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:35,680
So we try to cram everything he could
into a single sentence.

416
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,900
And so each sentence is like little
bomb.

417
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,520
One of his now.
And then he'd write something self

418
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,020
referential.
So one phrase of his is,

419
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,190
I write more in this,
I write in a sentence what other people

420
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,600
write in a book.
That's pretty good.

421
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:54,100
That's a good bread.
But then he talked it right away after

422
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:56,860
he said what other people can't even
write in a book.

423
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,253
Yeah.

424
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,590
Narcissism.
And then like he just punched through

425
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:06,190
that.
But it's true.

426
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,660
Like that's the thing.
It's true.

427
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,990
So it wasn't narcissism,
I mean for anyone else,

428
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,450
what does it mean for him?
It was just true.

429
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,510
So yeah.
Yeah.

430
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,220
So back to human
nature,

431
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,450
sort of hypothesize that in order for
people to overcome the psychological

432
00:22:25,451 --> 00:22:28,600
consequences of the destruction of their
religious underpinnings,

433
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,310
they would have to transform themselves
into virtually into the thing that they

434
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:35,530
had killed.
So natures,

435
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,510
and this was,
believe me for nature,

436
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,100
this was like a revelatory solution.
He came up with this in a book called

437
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,400
bus fakes there too.
Stroke.

438
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:44,920
Now everybody who reads nature starts to
read.

439
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:48,280
Thus there's is there a booster because
it's got such a cool title,

440
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,950
you know,
but you shouldn't read that book,

441
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,970
at least not until you've read,
say beyond good and evil and other books

442
00:22:54,971 --> 00:22:57,820
that he wrote because thus fakes there a
booster is a weird book.

443
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,700
It's like the old testament revelation
and it really is,

444
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:03,760
it's like it's a fantasy.
This man comes down from the mountain

445
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:08,761
and he starts to spout off like poetic
revelations and niches.

446
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:13,780
The rest of each punks are like very,
very clear and cutting thought,

447
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,800
where's this one is like a,
it's like a Shakespearean drama almost.

448
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:19,840
You know?
And the reason for that is because

449
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:24,160
nature was reaching beyond the grip of
his intellect to try to formulate

450
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:28,270
answers to questions that he could not,
he could not grasp because what he was

451
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:30,400
trying to figure out is,
well,

452
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,920
as human beings have developed
cognitively,

453
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:35,920
in some sense,
we've escaped from our culture and our

454
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:40,600
instincts and when we're embedded in our
culture and our instincts were invented

455
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,880
unconsciously within a religious
framework.

456
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:46,430
It's the framework of presuppositions
from which we emerged.

457
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,000
Like people didn't think up,
religions,

458
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,080
what he has is there some little weird
little,

459
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:54,410
what we call it,
conspiracy going on for 3000 years.

460
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,363
It's like,
no,

461
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,490
it's not about power.
Even though it can be twisted to be

462
00:23:58,491 --> 00:24:01,190
about power,
everything can be or twist it to be

463
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,770
about economics.
It's about fantasy.

464
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:08,000
You know that all that you look inside
here at the cathedral,

465
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,400
all you see is fantasy.
It's in,

466
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,550
it's in brilliant lights portrayed
everywhere.

467
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,820
It's trying to say something to you,
well,

468
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:17,900
what's it trying to say?
Well,

469
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:22,010
it turned out when people ask themselves
that instead of just acting it out,

470
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,720
they hadn't got a clue.
And it said,

471
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,620
I had no idea what it said any more than
you guys know why you have Christmas

472
00:24:27,621 --> 00:24:30,470
trees.
So how many of you have Christmas trees?

473
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,390
Yeah,
why?

474
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,600
Well,
I dunno.

475
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,680
I never noticed we had Christmas trees,
you know?

476
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,180
No,
but my point is,

477
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:41,000
my point is that in a culture you can
follow,

478
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,910
you follow the customs because that's
what you do.

479
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,890
And,
but then when you wake up a bit and just

480
00:24:45,891 --> 00:24:46,310
think,
well,

481
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:51,310
you're just like the Ph Jedi and child
who is taken out of the game and forced

482
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,370
to look at it,
it's like,

483
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:53,780
well,
why are you playing that game and what

484
00:24:53,781 --> 00:24:54,890
are the rules?
Well,

485
00:24:54,891 --> 00:24:56,960
I'd never thought about it before.
Well,

486
00:24:56,961 --> 00:25:00,230
as soon as people started to think about
the games they were playing,

487
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,560
it was often because they encountered
other people who thought apparently

488
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:04,700
thought differently,
you know?

489
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,360
So if you're like a Rottie Christian and
you'd go into the east and all of a

490
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:11,000
sudden you've come up with a Buddhist,
he's smart.

491
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:13,010
It's like you to have big problems,
right?

492
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,590
Cause you're smart and he's smart and
you don't think the same way.

493
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,650
At least apparently you don't think the
same way at all.

494
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,010
So even if you say,
well who was Buddhist?

495
00:25:22,011 --> 00:25:23,390
You know,
we should just wipe them out.

496
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:28,070
It doesn't matter because their thoughts
are already there and they've been

497
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:31,970
working on them for like a couple of
thousand years and whether you like it

498
00:25:31,971 --> 00:25:34,130
or not,
they're going to make you think.

499
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,680
And once you start thinking about your
religion,

500
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,800
you're in trouble.
And so that's the situation we're in

501
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:43,700
right now.
So young took this problem that needs

502
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:47,810
you to had posed seriously.
Cause young was caught up quite

503
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:50,330
dramatically in the events of,
of,

504
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,520
of Nazi Germany.
Now you know,

505
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:56,660
when we think about Nazi Germany,
we think of course that it was perfectly

506
00:25:56,661 --> 00:25:59,780
obvious that the Nazis were the,
were the perpetrators and that,

507
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:01,250
you know,
everyone else was the victim.

508
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,190
And that if we were there we would have
clearly seen that and we wouldn't have

509
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:06,200
be Nazis.
And it's like that's not true.

510
00:26:06,201 --> 00:26:09,140
That isn't how it worked because these
things happen slowly.

511
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,880
They sorta happened piece by piece.

512
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,860
You know,
we started seeing a similar thing

513
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:17,450
happened I think after the,
after the twin towers fell in New York,

514
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,520
you know,
it's like people gave up five,

515
00:26:19,521 --> 00:26:22,760
10% of their civil liberties in like a
month,

516
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,200
you know,
and,

517
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,800
and,
and it was okay.

518
00:26:27,801 --> 00:26:30,200
It was like wasn't okay.
It wasn't okay.

519
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,310
And it just shows you how easy that sort
of thing can,

520
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,680
can start.
You know,

521
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:37,580
the Germans were under tremendous stress
in the 1930s their whole economy blew

522
00:26:37,581 --> 00:26:39,860
out.
They had to like take,

523
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:43,710
we'll book barrels full of billions of
marks to buy a piece of bread.

524
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,400
The currency fell to zero.
Unemployment was staggeringly high.

525
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:49,920
They were paying off debts like mad
because of the first world war.

526
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,410
And there was a real threat that the
communists were going to start a

527
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:55,080
revolution.
It's like you don't have problems like

528
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:59,550
that.
So the Germans had no idea what to do,

529
00:26:59,580 --> 00:26:59,850
you know?

530
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:03,480
And,
and Hitler was a canny canny person with

531
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:06,360
a brilliant,
brilliant sense of drama.

532
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,950
I mean,
he was a real,

533
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,190
he was a master of dark fire,
that guy.

534
00:27:11,191 --> 00:27:13,680
And I think his,
his unconscious fantasy was,

535
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,250
let's see how much we could destroy
before we die in the,

536
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,440
in the what?
Purifying flames.

537
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,510
That was Hitler.
So,

538
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,740
and he was,
he,

539
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:27,540
he was a compelling person and the
fantasy that he added the back of his

540
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:29,250
mind,
I'll tell you how that developed at one

541
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:31,980
point,
it was a very hard thing to escape from

542
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:36,750
and that's why the Germans became Nazis.
It wasn't like this was like magic that

543
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:41,751
had emerged and it was black magic.
So young was very interested in this

544
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:46,470
because he was in the Germanic speaking
areas of the world when this happened

545
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:49,110
and he fell,
felt himself pulled very strongly by

546
00:27:49,111 --> 00:27:52,500
what the Nazis were doing,
especially in the early stages of the

547
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:56,550
development of the political platform
because things did stabilize,

548
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,700
you know,
and then they stabilize before they went

549
00:27:59,701 --> 00:28:00,870
completely out of control.

550
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:05,460
And of course looking in retrospect,
you can see the seeds of what eventually

551
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,360
transpired to become such a catastrophe.
But at the time it was by no means self

552
00:28:10,361 --> 00:28:12,660
evident.
It's such a thing was going to occur,

553
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,900
especially given all the other horrible
things that were likely to occur.

554
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,000
So you only had a,
at a vision at one point in on the

555
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:23,460
train,
I think it was in Switzerland that

556
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:27,990
Europe had become so covered with blood,
but the blood was starting to flow over

557
00:28:27,991 --> 00:28:31,110
the mountains into Switzerland because
of course Switzerland is neutral and he

558
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:33,450
said it was one of the most horrifying
nightmares of his life.

559
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:37,770
And this was in I think 1930 it was late
late 1930s anyway,

560
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:42,771
so it was a premonition of war and
he spent a lot of time

561
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:49,680
trying to understand well if you going
to become a fascist and worship the

562
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:52,770
state and you weren't going to become a
nihilist and worship nothing,

563
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,090
what in the world where you going to do
exactly the Orient Yourself and how

564
00:28:57,091 --> 00:29:01,320
would you protect yourself against the
attractions of blind state

565
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:02,700
identification,
for example,

566
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,890
or the attractions of nihilism,
you know,

567
00:29:04,891 --> 00:29:07,260
you might say,
well nihilism has no traction at all

568
00:29:07,261 --> 00:29:09,540
because it says to you everything is
irrelevant.

569
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,630
Nothing you do has any importance cause
that's nihilistic basically.

570
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,913
Well,
what's the,

571
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,170
what's the,
the psychoanalyst would say,

572
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,140
what's the secondary gain from that?
Like,

573
00:29:19,141 --> 00:29:20,640
yeah,
I do say that's what you believe.

574
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,370
And maybe you even knocked it out.
And you also say,

575
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:25,500
well,
you've come to that conclusion through,

576
00:29:25,501 --> 00:29:27,990
you know,
a rational process of deliberation at

577
00:29:27,991 --> 00:29:32,160
the psychoanalyst would say it's kind of
convenient that that also alleviates you

578
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:34,230
of all responsibility,
isn't it?

579
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:39,540
And it kind of sheds a little dampness
on your plane to pristine cognition as

580
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:41,280
the driving force between,
you know,

581
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,990
behind your adoption of that theory.
You know,

582
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,570
it's like,
it's like the Patriot who claims that,

583
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:48,250
you know,
the reason that he's kicking someone in

584
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:50,410
the head is because he's patriotic.
It's like,

585
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:50,921
no,
no,

586
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:53,230
no,
you're patriotic so that you can kick

587
00:29:53,231 --> 00:29:56,560
someone in the head and still look at
yourself in the mirror in the morning,

588
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:59,110
has nothing to do with rational
deliberation.

589
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:02,860
And so the psychoanalysts and human was
like this in particular,

590
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,440
you know,
they're always extremely skeptical about

591
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:08,680
people's rational claims about their
commitments to ideology.

592
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:12,190
And rightly so.
One of the things you said lawfully.

593
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:16,390
He said some things that were so
brilliant was that people didn't have

594
00:30:16,391 --> 00:30:18,460
ideas.
Ideas have people.

595
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,440
And when you think that,
I see,

596
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:21,280
it's like,
it's like,

597
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,400
I think this is so funny.
It's like Dawkins idea of the meme,

598
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:25,841
you know,
some of you,

599
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:27,490
how many of you read Dawkins?
He's,

600
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:28,480
you know,
yeah.

601
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:31,300
Okay.
So dawkins has this idea of mean so

602
00:30:31,301 --> 00:30:35,050
funny to read,
darkens cause it's like 20% of the way

603
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:37,330
to being a union without even knowing
it.

604
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,640
And so he's produced this idea called
meme,

605
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:41,920
which is these I,
their ideas,

606
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:45,730
I mean is an idea that sort of has an
independent existence in a sense because

607
00:30:45,731 --> 00:30:49,690
it can affect different minds are moved
from mine to mine and he kind of thinks

608
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:50,980
of it more like a fab.

609
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:55,300
While the archetypes are means except
there no fats,

610
00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:00,850
they're memes that have lasted for like
20,000 years or maybe 20 million years.

611
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:05,440
We have no idea how old they are.
And young got where Dawkins was going,

612
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:06,940
like,
you know,

613
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:11,970
50 years before and 200 stories deeper.
So it's so funny to read Dawkins because

614
00:31:13,661 --> 00:31:16,360
what he is searching for,
it has already been figured out by

615
00:31:16,361 --> 00:31:18,550
young,
but he's so prejudiced against any kind

616
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:21,040
of religious thinking that there's no
way he'll ever find it.

617
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:27,700
So one of the things you did was he,
he's deeply,

618
00:31:27,701 --> 00:31:31,000
deeply study the substructures of
thought.

619
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,430
So for you,
like you know,

620
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,520
when we talked about piaget a bit and we
said for piaget,

621
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:38,740
you kind of built your brain from your
body upward.

622
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,930
Brilliant idea.
It's so smart,

623
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:44,400
but you'll,
you'll has a lot of piaget in him it's,

624
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,370
it's more implicit.

625
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,410
But for young,
not only was your

626
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,670
sub structures of your thought,
biological and so therefore based in

627
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,950
your body,
but your body was also cultural and

628
00:31:56,951 --> 00:32:00,430
historical and also partly because
you're,

629
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,730
you're an evolved creature.
So God only knows what's in there.

630
00:32:03,731 --> 00:32:08,290
3.5 billion years worth of weirdness
that you can draw on or that can,

631
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,170
that can move you where it wants to move
you.

632
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,890
But I'll also,
you're being shaped by cultural dynamics

633
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,380
all the time.
And human beings in particular,

634
00:32:17,381 --> 00:32:21,790
like we're just watching each other like
mad all the time to see what we're up

635
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:23,380
to,
what people think of us,

636
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,930
how we should behaving.
Are we being boring?

637
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,550
Are People attracted to us?
It's like we're social right to the core

638
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,470
and that's another way that you can
understand an archetype.

639
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:35,500
It's like part of the archetype is that
we are social to the core,

640
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,040
so we're interested in other people and
more if you're extroverted and less if

641
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,960
you're introverted,
but it doesn't matter by the standards

642
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:44,390
of say,
solitary animals.

643
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,580
We're so social,
it's just unbelievable.

644
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,400
And so that's built in.
It's built in.

645
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,490
What's built in is that you find that
interesting.

646
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,940
That's the archetype.
The archetype is whatever it is that

647
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:59,210
makes you find that interesting.
It's beyond your control.

648
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,940
Like if you're extroverted,
you're interested in people.

649
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:05,930
You didn't decide that it decided it for
you.

650
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,510
The question is,
what is it?

651
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,340
Well,
it's your brain,

652
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,380
your brain,
your limbic system.

653
00:33:12,381 --> 00:33:14,780
One of the hell back means like we don't
know what that means.

654
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,100
You know?
Oh,

655
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:18,560
we have no idea how your brain produces
consciousness.

656
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,630
Like I am,
I'm dead serious.

657
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:23,650
We haven't got a clue.
And what that indicates to me,

658
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,990
since we've been hacking away at it for
say 400 years,

659
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:32,090
is that the way we think about
consciousness is wrong because we're not

660
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:34,610
getting anywhere.
Like we'd go a long ways with lots of

661
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:35,444
things.

662
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,430
We're not getting anywhere with
consciousness.

663
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,520
Okay.
So back to the archetypes.

664
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,180
So I,
cause I can tell you how these things

665
00:33:41,181 --> 00:33:44,660
arise to some degree.
So you're interested in other people say

666
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,890
and so you're interested in them because
they're unbelievably useful resources,

667
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,660
right?
Because they don't think they have

668
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:54,440
resources that you want.
Plus he won even subtle things from

669
00:33:54,441 --> 00:33:55,510
them.
You want their attention,

670
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,720
you want to play with them,
you know,

671
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,240
you,
there's all sorts of things that you

672
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:02,000
need and want from other people.
So the social interactions are

673
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:06,260
incredibly valuable and informative.
But the information is interesting

674
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:11,261
because part of what every single person
is constantly broadcasting every other's

675
00:34:11,781 --> 00:34:16,781
person is how to behave.
So now if you meet someone and,

676
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,140
and let's say you find them interesting,
well I can tell you that

677
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,720
the more ideal they are assuming you're
not to work,

678
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,980
the more ideal they are,
the more you've got to be interested in

679
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:33,440
them because that actually is what
defines ideal.

680
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:36,740
Like as you become my heel,
you can say that it's also the same as

681
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,380
becoming high status.
As you become ideal,

682
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:44,590
then you're interesting to people.
So that's interesting because that what

683
00:34:45,351 --> 00:34:49,310
that means is that you can read off
people's interest to find out when

684
00:34:49,311 --> 00:34:52,490
you're deviating from the ideal and they
don't even know what the ideal is.

685
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:57,500
The ideal is that to which their
attention is an EXEC inexhaustibly drawn

686
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,660
and they're always telling you when you
should fall short of the ideal always.

687
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,820
It's being broadcast at you all the
time.

688
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:08,930
And then your imagination back there is
to try and figure out just what is this

689
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,980
ideal,
you know?

690
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:13,220
Because your imagination is watching you
and a phd had sense,

691
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,580
noticing what you do and then trying to
figure out what that is.

692
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:21,530
So you'll have fantasies about the ideal
that that often happens in a romantic

693
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:23,390
relationship,
especially at the beginning of it,

694
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:27,020
cause you know you,
you project your idealization onto the

695
00:35:27,021 --> 00:35:28,790
person that you're romantically
attracted to.

696
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:32,780
That's the projection of an archetype.
So young would say the woman will

697
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:36,920
project an animus onto the man.
The animus is her conceptualization of

698
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,790
the ideal man is it's unconscious
because it's rooted in fantasy and the

699
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:45,990
man will be in concordance with that
projection in some areas that's,

700
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:48,000
those are the areas where she likes him
by the way.

701
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,170
And we'll be discordant in other areas.
And that's the areas where she

702
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:55,710
constantly did disappoints him as the
relationship develops.

703
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:01,260
So their projection is there in part to
help the person to understand who it is

704
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:03,360
that they're dealing with.
Because when you meet someone,

705
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,550
you have to pee,
you have to assume something about them.

706
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,500
It's the same as projection.
You have to assume something about the

707
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,170
men.
If you find that fascinating,

708
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,790
which is what happens if you fall in
love,

709
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:14,250
maybe it's because they smell good or
they're symmetrical or something,

710
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,110
you immediately assume that,
well,

711
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:17,190
those things really mattered.

712
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,850
You immediately assume that they embody
the ideal.

713
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,990
It's an oversimplification,
but oversimplification has a basis and

714
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:27,540
the basis is,
if it's interesting to me,

715
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,700
it must be close to the ideal.
Well,

716
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:31,830
yeah,
except the person that you're going out

717
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:35,580
with the to is warped and Benton flawed,
twisted,

718
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:38,760
and you know,
300 ways and you'll find that out soon

719
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:42,510
enough just as they will about you.
And that often just blows the

720
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:44,550
relationship into fits because the
person will say,

721
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,430
well,
she wasn't who I thought she was like,

722
00:36:47,431 --> 00:36:49,860
well,
who said whoever sends she was who you

723
00:36:49,861 --> 00:36:51,270
thought she was.
It's like,

724
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:54,450
where did you get the misapprehension
that she was going to be who you thought

725
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:55,710
she was?
God,

726
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:57,360
why don't you know?
You know,

727
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,200
here's let alone your lending referred
by your sense of smell and your ability

728
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:02,880
to detect symmetry.
It's like,

729
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,390
yeah,
that's not very sophisticated.

730
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,010
So those are,
those are,

731
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:12,120
so the adamant ananymous are two primary
human archetypes and they're very

732
00:37:12,121 --> 00:37:15,510
complex.
But that kind of gets at the surface the

733
00:37:15,511 --> 00:37:20,511
ideal that I was describing.
So people are broadcasting information

734
00:37:21,091 --> 00:37:24,080
to each other,
which is the ideal bid will be ideal and

735
00:37:24,081 --> 00:37:27,030
it's like be my ideal obviously.
But let's say,

736
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:32,270
let's say if if I took a thousand ideals
and then average them or extracted out

737
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,690
the common ideal,
the ideal of what was common to all of

738
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:38,670
them,
that would be a savior figures.

739
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:42,780
That's what a savior figure is.
And then now,

740
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:47,810
now and then someone comes along who
acts quite a bit like that at booth

741
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,550
you've got yourself a religion.
So don't be thinking that these images

742
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:57,570
that people fall around like,
like you know like what blood hounds on

743
00:37:57,571 --> 00:37:59,610
the trail do.
You don't have to be thinking that those

744
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,220
things are like conscious cognitive
constructs.

745
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,340
It's like conscious cognitive constructs
like Marxism.

746
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,070
They last like 50 years and they kill
100 million people and then that's the

747
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:14,670
end of that.
A good religious system,

748
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:16,230
man,
that'll keep the culture going for like

749
00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:18,810
3000 years.
And even at the end of it,

750
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,510
it doesn't disappear.
We know that the story of horace and no

751
00:38:21,511 --> 00:38:22,620
serious,
for example,

752
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:26,520
drove Egypt,
like Catholicism drove Europe for like

753
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:29,040
3000 years.
That's a long time.

754
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,400
And then it turned into Christianity.
So it sounds like it disappeared

755
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,260
actually.
It's sort of transmuted into Judaism and

756
00:38:35,261 --> 00:38:39,010
then turned into Christianity.
So it's not like the idea is disappear.

757
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,800
They can disappear at all.
And believe me,

758
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:45,850
you're just as possessed by them as any
ancient Egyptian.

759
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:49,270
It's just that you're more of a
fragmented and conflict because what

760
00:38:49,271 --> 00:38:52,510
your unconscious assumes and what your
conscious mind assumes aren't the same

761
00:38:52,511 --> 00:38:53,261
thing.
And so you're like,

762
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:57,130
you're all at war with yourself,
not as part of what makes you attracted

763
00:38:57,131 --> 00:38:59,410
to like more on etiologies.

764
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,710
By which I mean any of the Ology,
because they're all,

765
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:06,310
they're all false idols and false gods
and there's shallow,

766
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,940
they're shallow and deadly and they ruin
your life.

767
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:14,740
They destroy your soul.
So that's just a catastrophic response

768
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:18,250
and that's why it's so terrible to have
that discordance between your

769
00:39:18,251 --> 00:39:22,060
instinctual being,
your deep instinctual b and your little

770
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:23,080
fragile,
you know,

771
00:39:23,081 --> 00:39:26,350
halfway that conscious mind that sort of
thinks it's in control.

772
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,180
It's like you're not in control of
anything.

773
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,110
Leave me best you can do is follow
what's right.

774
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,480
That's the best you can do.
Wait,

775
00:39:34,481 --> 00:39:36,430
I mean,
we even know this neurologically to some

776
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:38,950
degree.
Like if you look at the hypothalamus,

777
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,740
it's a little part of the brain we'll
talk about quite a bit.

778
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:46,360
It's sort of where the Freud Freud and
resides to the degree that it resides

779
00:39:46,361 --> 00:39:48,700
anywhere.
It's this collection of nuclei that do

780
00:39:48,701 --> 00:39:52,240
things like make you hungry or make you
thirsty or make you,

781
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,520
you know,
sexually desirous or um,

782
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:02,360
make you defensively impressive or make
you terrified of an intruder who,

783
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:04,840
who,
who threatens your dominant status.

784
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,340
It's this little tiny part of your
brain.

785
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:10,720
It's hardly even there at all as massive
projections coming up into the CORTEX.

786
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,750
And then there's little tendrils going
down to regulate it.

787
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:17,950
And so basically as long as everything
is pretty much perfect,

788
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,760
your conscious mind is in control.
But as soon as things deviate from the

789
00:40:24,101 --> 00:40:27,850
path to any degree whatsoever,
the really smart parts of your brain

790
00:40:27,851 --> 00:40:31,870
take over and then you do what they tell
you to do or you suffer the

791
00:40:31,871 --> 00:40:34,470
consequences.
So you see this with people who've been

792
00:40:34,471 --> 00:40:39,070
geed for example,
or sometimes people develop a condition

793
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:41,830
called Polydypsia,
which is often a consequence of

794
00:40:41,831 --> 00:40:45,640
hypothalamic damage attended on a stroke
and they'll drink water until they die.

795
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,810
You cannot stop because they,
they're ragingly thirsty.

796
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:53,290
Like someone who is starving and like
you can say,

797
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:54,670
well you've had enough water.
It's like,

798
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:56,530
no,
that is not going to cut it.

799
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,100
It's not,
you're not getting anywhere with that.

800
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:03,280
And you see the same thing with people
who have like obsessive compulsive

801
00:41:03,281 --> 00:41:04,600
disorders,
something like that.

802
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,120
When they're not in the grip of the
disorder,

803
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:10,420
they're perfectly normal.
You get those people to touch something.

804
00:41:10,421 --> 00:41:13,210
They don't want to talk just like
they're not the same person.

805
00:41:13,211 --> 00:41:17,140
The second they do that and whatever
they thought of themselves,

806
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,780
you know the themselves that was
supposed to be in control.

807
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,990
That bloody thing is like,
it's like a wagon with a child and it

808
00:41:22,991 --> 00:41:24,880
being towed behind an elephant.
There's just,

809
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,330
it's got no control at all.
So you have,

810
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:31,940
one of the things that's terrifying
about yoga is that there,

811
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:37,320
there's no escaping the realization of
the nature of the forces that are behind

812
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,970
the puppets that we are,
you know,

813
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,950
in Pinocchio.
That's why Pinocchio was a puppet,

814
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,770
right?
Something's pulling his strings.

815
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:48,650
He's a marionette and the things that
are pulling the strings,

816
00:41:48,651 --> 00:41:52,160
while they might have his best interest
in mind,

817
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:55,190
but they might not too.
And so that's what Pinocchio was about

818
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:57,140
actually.
And it's also about how not to be a

819
00:41:57,141 --> 00:41:59,780
mannequin.
It turns out that you have to go to the

820
00:41:59,781 --> 00:42:03,770
bottom of the ocean and find your father
in a whale and then drown.

821
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,570
That's how you start from being a
puppet.

822
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:06,951
It's like,
and you think,

823
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:08,870
well you don't believe that.
And I would say,

824
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:09,531
well,
yes you do.

825
00:42:09,531 --> 00:42:11,540
You went and watched the movie and you
enjoyed it.

826
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,620
Not only that you understood it,
even though you don't have any idea what

827
00:42:15,621 --> 00:42:19,040
it's about.
And also on the face of it,

828
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:22,910
it's absolutely absurd.
It's like it's not a pocket first,

829
00:42:22,911 --> 00:42:26,030
it's a drawing of a puppet.
So that's weird that like,

830
00:42:26,031 --> 00:42:27,260
that's two levels of weird.

831
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,110
And then like what the hell is been the
cricket where he comes from,

832
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:31,101
you know,
and what's,

833
00:42:31,101 --> 00:42:34,220
what's his role and why is he the
conscience and why does he get like

834
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:37,520
activated by a ferry?
And why is the Pfarius starts like

835
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:38,241
you're in there,
you know,

836
00:42:38,241 --> 00:42:41,510
like cletus the slack joy,
you'll pull watching the screen

837
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,010
captivated by it and you know,
you walk out and you don't even notice

838
00:42:46,011 --> 00:42:50,240
that you're so peculiar that it,
it's just beyond belief.

839
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,120
You don't even notice that.
That's so peculiar.

840
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:54,890
It's like,
what the hell are you doing in that

841
00:42:54,891 --> 00:42:59,891
theater watching this marionette follow
a bug route to an eight to a whale.

842
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,610
It's like you walk out,
oh,

843
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:02,750
that was so touching.

844
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,590
Really.
Like,

845
00:43:06,591 --> 00:43:10,460
really?
People are really crazy and weird.

846
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,290
Like,
we're like rhinoceroses the report

847
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:15,200
platypuses or ostriches or penguins
were,

848
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,890
we're right to the core.
And when you start to,

849
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:23,720
the weirdness is so deep,
it's so ancient that even starting to

850
00:43:23,721 --> 00:43:27,710
touch consciousness of that just it's
just rocks your boat.

851
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,230
So,
but,

852
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,310
but one thing or another will rock your
boat.

853
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:35,390
So sometimes it's nice to choose what,
what thing it is and prepares you for

854
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:40,040
things too.
So I'll tell you part of what an Lto

855
00:43:40,041 --> 00:43:41,930
needs and Nokia,
Mary Nett,

856
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,850
anybody can pull the strings.
I mean,

857
00:43:43,851 --> 00:43:46,250
he's got a good heart,
but what's not worth nothing?

858
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,920
Virtually nothing because he's naive.
You know,

859
00:43:48,921 --> 00:43:50,690
you can,
it's the Fox and the,

860
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:53,750
what is it?
That stupid cat that manipulate him,

861
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,260
right?
And basically behind them you'll see the

862
00:43:57,261 --> 00:44:00,200
devil because that devil pops out quite
quickly and Pinocchio.

863
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,670
And he's the thing that's behind all the
local manifestations of evil that are

864
00:44:04,671 --> 00:44:08,690
trying to pope UN occhio strings and he
gets blown off the right path,

865
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:12,410
pretty badly.
Almost turns into a unconsciously brain

866
00:44:12,411 --> 00:44:14,710
donkey who ends up working in the slave
minds,

867
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,430
which is exactly what happens.
By the way,

868
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:17,570
you know,
to,

869
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,170
that's what happened to devout communist
who found themselves swallowed up by

870
00:44:21,171 --> 00:44:24,160
Stalins nightmare in the 1940s in the
1950s slow.

871
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,740
Well we were so good.
We did everything you wanted.

872
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,650
It's like,
yeah,

873
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:30,200
well it turned out what we wanted is for
you to die painfully.

874
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,420
So you know,
congratulations.

875
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,540
So you know,
in that brilliantly laid out in an oak

876
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:38,610
hill,
which in fact was written in the 1930s

877
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,490
brilliantly laid out.
It's it's way,

878
00:44:41,491 --> 00:44:45,240
it's way more intelligent analysis of
the 1930s than anything you'll ever find

879
00:44:45,241 --> 00:44:48,240
that was written.
So Pinocchio,

880
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:52,050
you know,
he's trying to cue the proper path and

881
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,000
he learns that he shouldn't lie.

882
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,110
That's an,
that's a,

883
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,980
what do you call archetypal idea,
telling you why that is later.

884
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:02,040
And it turns out that in order to get
out of the horrible mess that he's put

885
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:05,440
himself in,
partly by being un UN Unsung,

886
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:09,810
a slavish adherence,
adherence to like momentary pleasure and

887
00:45:09,811 --> 00:45:10,920
nihilism,
you know,

888
00:45:10,921 --> 00:45:14,760
he ends up half a jackass who can't
speak properly without breaking.

889
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:18,360
So that makes him an idiot log.
And the only way that he can get out of

890
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:22,710
that is to go down to the bottom of the
ocean as deep as he could possibly go

891
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:26,550
deeper than anything is willing to go to
find his father.

892
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,750
What's his father?
His father is the culture that he lost

893
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,580
touch with.
You know,

894
00:45:32,581 --> 00:45:34,410
and to the degree that you guys are
lost,

895
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,440
like all human beings are lost.
The reason you're lost,

896
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:40,380
it's because you've never rescued your
father from the bottom of the ocean.

897
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,340
You haven't gone deep enough.
You won't,

898
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:45,090
you won't even know when it was
necessary.

899
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,710
It's necessary.
You're a social historical cultural

900
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:53,610
creature right down to where you become
a biological creature.

901
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:56,610
And if that isn't part of you,
and if that part isn't functioning

902
00:45:56,611 --> 00:45:58,470
properly,
then your,

903
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,660
you can just be blown off course by the
wind.

904
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:03,420
There's nothing to you.
You're not grounded in anything.

905
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,660
That's partly why the shoreham and when
they go down,

906
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:10,230
communicate with their ancestors,
that's what they're trying to do.

907
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:15,231
And they're trying to pull up the
cultural understructure of their,

908
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:18,450
of their societies up into consciousness
to make use of it.

909
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,170
And you constantly have to have a
dialogue with that because you know,

910
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,930
say,
say your background just for the sake of

911
00:46:24,931 --> 00:46:28,750
argument has Jewish,
a lot of the lines of have,

912
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,720
you know,
the culture that you're embedded in was

913
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,760
written down by people several thousand
years ago.

914
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,080
It's like,
it's not easy to figure out what the

915
00:46:34,081 --> 00:46:37,320
hell those people were talking about or
why it's relevant to you.

916
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,680
So there has to be a dialogue
continually going on between the present

917
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:45,060
and the past so that you can bring the
wisdom forward without losing what's in

918
00:46:45,061 --> 00:46:46,890
it.
Because if you lose what's in it,

919
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:49,950
it's like you're just nowhere.
You know,

920
00:46:49,951 --> 00:46:53,340
I see this all the time and you might in
my practice,

921
00:46:53,341 --> 00:46:55,170
you know,
often that happens to people who get

922
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:58,590
divorced or who are living together and
not married,

923
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,400
which you think,
well,

924
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,140
you're free.
It's like you don't want her to be that

925
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:02,310
free.
You know,

926
00:47:02,311 --> 00:47:05,910
you want to argue with your partner
about every single thing for the rest of

927
00:47:05,911 --> 00:47:06,870
your life.
Well,

928
00:47:06,871 --> 00:47:09,240
that's what you have to do.
If you don't let your culture guide you,

929
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:10,680
it's like there's no rules.

930
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,230
Go ahead.
Make up all the rules.

931
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,110
See how easy that is,
Christ,

932
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:18,210
that'll kill the average person in 10
years.

933
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,540
It's just such a weight and you only
have one life.

934
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:24,150
You know?
You might as well let some tradition

935
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:26,430
guide you so you have some pieces some
of the time,

936
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:29,100
or you'll end up divorced and with
children's,

937
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,293
ew,
ew.

938
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:35,500
That's cancer for lots of people.
They get divorced,

939
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:38,260
they have children,
they get locked into a custody battle

940
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:40,000
and they're done.
That's the end of the ride.

941
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:45,360
They're ruined by it.
So you step outside of the guidelines of

942
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:49,900
your culture at your own peril and
modern people because they're so

943
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:50,734
coddled.
They,

944
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:51,880
oh yeah,
well we can handle it.

945
00:47:51,881 --> 00:47:53,620
It's like,
sure you can.

946
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:57,460
You wait until you get there.
You'll find out that you can't handle it

947
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,100
and it'll be too late.
What will has,

948
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:03,490
what will have happened is that you know
the way all that you were supposed to go

949
00:48:03,491 --> 00:48:08,350
confront and rescue your father from has
risen out of the water and taking you

950
00:48:08,351 --> 00:48:10,030
down and you're done.

951
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:15,010
That's chaos.
So these are serious issues.

952
00:48:15,011 --> 00:48:17,530
Like Yo,
I would say it was the most serious

953
00:48:17,531 --> 00:48:19,810
thinker of the 20th century.
I think he was.

954
00:48:19,811 --> 00:48:23,710
So,
he was so serious that the pseudo

955
00:48:23,711 --> 00:48:26,470
serious people who read them just bounce
off them.

956
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:28,450
They don't even know what the hell he's
up to.

957
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:33,310
So in young was one of those thinkers
who was addressing questions that most

958
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:37,270
people don't know exist,
like at the bottom of reality,

959
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:42,810
and who was also answering them.
So he's a twofold blow to the intellect.

960
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,520
First he tells you that you're so
stupid,

961
00:48:45,521 --> 00:48:49,000
you don't even know what's wrong.
You can't even ask the right questions.

962
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,680
And then he answers them.
It's like,

963
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,533
Whoa,
boy.

964
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:53,200
Yeah,
that'll,

965
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:54,933
that'll,
uh,

966
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:58,540
doing your intellectual pretentions.
So,

967
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,800
and the contrast between darkens I think
in young is exactly the right contrast.

968
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:06,670
It's the contrast between the
intelligent modern Dawkins in the sort

969
00:49:06,671 --> 00:49:09,100
of historically centered.
Why is math?

970
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:12,660
And it's sort of painful for me to watch
because I've kind of watched golf.

971
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,133
You know,
he's,

972
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:18,280
he's not a happy man and he's got a
tremendous resentment against the

973
00:49:18,281 --> 00:49:19,690
church.
I'm sure it's something terrible.

974
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:21,370
Must have happened to him when he was a
child,

975
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:22,773
but

976
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:26,883
okay.

977
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,600
Anyways,
let me show you some of this stuff

978
00:49:29,601 --> 00:49:31,580
because it's such fun.
It's such fuck,

979
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:35,040
did it sound fun?
Not really.

980
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:37,790
Okay,
so I'm going to show you the opening in

981
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,780
the lion king.

982
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:53,300
Yup.
Yeah,

983
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:54,520
yeah.
Good,

984
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,400
good,
good idea.

985
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:56,900
Good idea.
Thanks.

986
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:14,450
Like why not use a media player?
That works.

987
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:18,843
Okay.

988
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,860
Okay,
so what I'm going to play for you is the

989
00:50:57,861 --> 00:50:59,960
opening scene,
the opening scene.

990
00:50:59,961 --> 00:51:04,310
It's very nicely designed.
So the music I find a little bit

991
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:08,870
manipulative.
It's a little poppy and,

992
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:12,830
and it's manipulated.
Like it's an interesting example of how

993
00:51:12,831 --> 00:51:17,831
art can go wrong because it's sort of
art design for a purpose and art cannot

994
00:51:17,901 --> 00:51:22,901
be designed for a purpose.
The purpose of art is art purpose,

995
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:25,460
not your purpose.
And so if you're trying to bend the arc

996
00:51:25,461 --> 00:51:27,440
to your purpose,
it's like you're,

997
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:33,320
you're like you're painting a picture of
a stick man on a stained glass window.

998
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,050
Like you just don't have,
you just haven't got the right

999
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:39,080
orientation.
Art is an exploratory process and it's

1000
00:51:39,081 --> 00:51:40,940
supposed to take you beyond what you
know.

1001
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:44,510
If you take art and try to force it into
your precut pre conceptions,

1002
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:47,250
then you're,
you're a propagandist and an Nydia log

1003
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:50,330
and it's like you're,
you're bending the greater to the lesser

1004
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:52,730
so in that makes it feel cheap and,
and,

1005
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,050
and,
and

1006
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:58,880
it doesn't fit well.
And like the Latin kings a pretty good

1007
00:51:58,881 --> 00:52:01,010
movie.
And I mean from a,

1008
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:06,380
from a psychological perspective,
it devolves into propaganda from time to

1009
00:52:06,381 --> 00:52:08,600
time.
That happens isn't salts,

1010
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,070
but you know,
it's,

1011
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:12,860
it's,
it's still a work.

1012
00:52:12,861 --> 00:52:16,310
It's a work of genius,
which is why you will know it.

1013
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:19,700
This is where you get your religion.

1014
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:35,820
Okay.
So that's an archetypal image they open

1015
00:52:35,821 --> 00:52:36,600
with it,
right?

1016
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,780
So it's the dawn of consciousness,
so it's the new day,

1017
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:42,660
but it's also the dawn of consciousness,
dawn of consciousness because you're a

1018
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:47,280
visual creature and it's also the dawn
of consciousness because you wake up in

1019
00:52:47,281 --> 00:52:50,640
the morning,
so it's like sun rise,

1020
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:55,380
light dawn of consciousness,
and then the music is a celebration of

1021
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:57,660
that and you can feel it in grips you
right away.

1022
00:52:57,690 --> 00:52:59,340
I mean that,
that part of the music is really,

1023
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:02,940
really nice.
I think that's the gospel singers from

1024
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,210
South Africa.
I think it is the guys that played with

1025
00:53:06,211 --> 00:53:07,310
Paul Simon.
I think so.

1026
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:13,460
They're great.
Okay.

1027
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,630
So what are all the animals doing all of
a sudden

1028
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:24,840
and you're waking up and they're paying
attention to a call,

1029
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:26,700
right?
And call his musical.

1030
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:28,140
So then the question is,
well,

1031
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:29,280
what's music?
Well,

1032
00:53:29,281 --> 00:53:33,120
music is a representation of like the
dynamic patterns of things.

1033
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,210
And so you get all of this complex
information that's going on right off

1034
00:53:36,211 --> 00:53:37,770
the bat.
Consciousness dawns.

1035
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,610
And now there's a call and everything
that San Diego is to pay attention to

1036
00:53:41,611 --> 00:53:44,280
the call.
That's pretty good for like five seconds

1037
00:53:44,281 --> 00:53:45,114
of film.

1038
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,173
Okay.

1039
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:15,640
So now there's,
you feel makers hit you with a whole

1040
00:54:15,641 --> 00:54:17,800
succession of very beautiful images and
you know,

1041
00:54:17,801 --> 00:54:20,320
they do that with a very beautiful music
that's underneath.

1042
00:54:20,321 --> 00:54:22,660
And that's to put you like in a state of
harmony with,

1043
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,420
well normally with nature,
but with your own conceptions of the

1044
00:54:26,421 --> 00:54:29,220
beetroot and your sense of aesthetics.
It works quite nicely.

1045
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:31,450
Put pops into a dream very quickly.

1046
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:38,840
Yeah.
On

1047
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:48,950
staffing.
See

1048
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:56,120
then can have a
pc

1049
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:21,520
small.
Okay.

1050
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:26,200
So there's a lot going on there.
So the lyrics are quite interesting

1051
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:30,400
because the lyrics are making
representation to the,

1052
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:35,260
to that state of being that I talked to
you about that William James had

1053
00:55:35,261 --> 00:55:37,360
experienced stay with is nitrous oxide
visions.

1054
00:55:37,361 --> 00:55:40,660
But then also the piaget and the
constructivist sort of think about as

1055
00:55:40,661 --> 00:55:42,660
the ground of being.
So you know the,

1056
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,160
the,
the lyricist made the case that what

1057
00:55:45,161 --> 00:55:48,880
surrounds you is informative to a degree
that you will never be able to

1058
00:55:48,881 --> 00:55:51,310
comprehend it.
And the implication under that is that

1059
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:53,530
you know,
that at least one of the ways of

1060
00:55:53,531 --> 00:55:58,531
construing the ground of experiential
being is as an information rich matrix

1061
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:00,940
and the music is pushing you in that
direction too.

1062
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:04,930
Because the music is,
the music is a representation of what

1063
00:56:04,931 --> 00:56:09,931
that information rich matrix is like
because if it's patterned and complex

1064
00:56:09,971 --> 00:56:11,160
but understandable,
but it,

1065
00:56:11,161 --> 00:56:14,320
and it also evokes emotion.
So that's reality.

1066
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,510
And there's a lot of paradise imagery in
here.

1067
00:56:16,511 --> 00:56:19,780
Two ways because it's sort of like all
these animals are,

1068
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,200
they're all doing the same thing in
them,

1069
00:56:21,201 --> 00:56:24,760
sort of existing in harmony,
like elephants covered with birds.

1070
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:28,480
And so in a way it's a childish view of
the world because you know those

1071
00:56:28,481 --> 00:56:30,270
elephants are covered with the text and
you know,

1072
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:33,160
the lions are half starved because it's
been a drought.

1073
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:34,380
You know,
it's,

1074
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:35,980
it's,
it's not so good out there on the

1075
00:56:35,981 --> 00:56:37,840
African plains because it's not all,
you know,

1076
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:51,940
that'll teach me,

1077
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,093
okay,
so,

1078
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:56,590
but,
but they're getting you in the mood.

1079
00:56:56,591 --> 00:56:57,131
Now the,
the,

1080
00:56:57,131 --> 00:56:59,500
the,
the lyricist also made reference to the

1081
00:56:59,501 --> 00:57:02,120
fact that there's this,
there's a,

1082
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:06,010
there's a paradise.
There is an element of genesis in that

1083
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:10,900
systems because she talks about our
arrival on the earth,

1084
00:57:10,901 --> 00:57:13,600
so to speak,
and then are the dawning of

1085
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:15,640
consciousness,
which is this step into the sun.

1086
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:19,270
And so that's an archetype of multim
were placed on earth while here we are

1087
00:57:19,271 --> 00:57:20,680
after all.
And poof,

1088
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,230
we woke up.
And that,

1089
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:26,020
the reason that's an archetypal ideas,
cause that's what happens to everybody.

1090
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:27,580
Great.
Poof,

1091
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,820
you're placed on the earth bag.
One day you wake up.

1092
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:34,000
It's like the internal experience of
human beings and there's something

1093
00:57:34,001 --> 00:57:35,230
that's deeply real about it.

1094
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:42,223
Okay,

1095
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:43,143
that was cool.

1096
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:46,070
So we're going to force them to watch
that again.

1097
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:54,290
So that's a revelation,
right?

1098
00:57:54,291 --> 00:57:56,450
And so that's a very sneaky bit at the
camera work.

1099
00:57:56,451 --> 00:57:57,500
So you know,
first of all,

1100
00:57:57,501 --> 00:57:59,720
your,
your vision is obscured,

1101
00:57:59,721 --> 00:58:02,390
but then it's,
it's directed by the motion to this like

1102
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:04,220
place.
What's that?

1103
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,170
Well,
that's a good question.

1104
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:10,090
It's what,
and just what exactly is in pride Bra.

1105
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:15,520
[inaudible]

1106
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,590
that's right.
The Rock is where the king is.

1107
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:22,670
That's the top of the pyramid.
And we remember those,

1108
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:25,280
remember those trees I showed you from
the showman?

1109
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,770
It's so cool.
I just figured this out the other day.

1110
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,140
Inside that tree there was a mountain
and the mountain was surrounded by a

1111
00:58:33,141 --> 00:58:34,190
snake.
You remember that?

1112
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:37,130
There's a circle with the sneaker on it.
That's exactly the structure of this

1113
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,740
lion king set up.
You remember that?

1114
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:41,300
So you've got the mountain in the middle
there.

1115
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,970
What's on the outside?
Hyenas.

1116
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:47,870
That's right.
The chaos is out there where the light

1117
00:58:47,871 --> 00:58:49,340
won't touch.
Right?

1118
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:53,180
It's a perfect representation of the
Scandinavian world tree.

1119
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:54,980
So cool.
So okay,

1120
00:58:54,981 --> 00:58:59,600
now obviously you and other animals are
supposed to lift up your eyes,

1121
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,220
which is what the film maker made you
do.

1122
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,740
And focus on this thing.
It's a raw,

1123
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:07,940
what does the Rock,
what does a rock stand for?

1124
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,273
Hmm.

1125
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:13,590
Yes,
exactly.

1126
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:15,980
Why balance structure?
Why?

1127
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:21,050
Why is it rock a good metaphor for that?
That's great rocks there.

1128
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,040
They're strong.
Even in an earthquake,

1129
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:26,540
if you're lucky,
they won't liquefy.

1130
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,000
So you can,
you want to stand on a rock,

1131
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:31,970
right?
The question is what kind of rock do you

1132
00:59:31,971 --> 00:59:34,370
want to stand on?
And that's exactly,

1133
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:38,300
is it a physical rock that's one way of
looking at it or is there a metaphysical

1134
00:59:38,301 --> 00:59:40,490
rock that's even a better rock?
Well,

1135
00:59:40,491 --> 00:59:42,290
that's partly what this is film
investigates,

1136
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:46,400
but at the moment there was a rock and
it's been there forever and the king has

1137
00:59:46,401 --> 00:59:48,530
been there forever and the king is the
thing.

1138
00:59:48,531 --> 00:59:49,870
You have to talk with the dominance
hierarchy,

1139
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,980
which is why you lift up your eyes to
it.

1140
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:55,310
And the king here is a lion.
Why does that make sense?

1141
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,800
Lions aren't kings after all,
but maybe sense why

1142
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:04,340
they're up there at the top of the food
chain.

1143
01:00:04,341 --> 01:00:05,240
Okay.
So that's a good one.

1144
01:00:05,241 --> 01:00:06,560
Any other possible reasons?

1145
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:12,140
Yes.
Yeah,

1146
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:12,831
that's good.
Yeah,

1147
01:00:12,831 --> 01:00:13,570
definitely.
And the,

1148
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:17,030
and the animators capitalized on that
all the time and they're kind of noble

1149
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:17,810
looking,
you know,

1150
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:19,540
cause they're muscular and,
and,

1151
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,820
and plus they could eat you.
Right.

1152
01:00:22,821 --> 01:00:26,360
So that sort of indicates that there are
certain circumstances under which you

1153
01:00:26,361 --> 01:00:29,990
are at the bottom of the hierarchy and
the lion is it in fact at the tall.

1154
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:32,990
So cause a lion is also an on spiring
beast.

1155
01:00:32,991 --> 01:00:33,824
Like,
you know,

1156
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:37,040
the shepherds in the old testament
around that time,

1157
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,241
you know,
a shepherd,

1158
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:39,170
you think,
well shepherd,

1159
01:00:39,171 --> 01:00:40,910
he's dressed this little frilly hat and
you know,

1160
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:44,240
he's,
he's not much of a powerhouse at all,

1161
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:47,090
but those guys used to fight off lions.
It's like,

1162
01:00:47,091 --> 01:00:48,410
that's,
that's,

1163
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:51,350
you gotta be really tough to fight off a
lion with a steak,

1164
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,910
you know?
So,

1165
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,570
yeah.
So anyways,

1166
01:00:56,571 --> 01:00:58,370
okay,
so there's the rock and the sun is

1167
01:00:58,371 --> 01:00:58,940
shining on it.

1168
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:03,350
And what are the animals doing
gathering around the rock.

1169
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:07,700
Now we accept that as a narrative
possibility,

1170
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:10,550
right?
You don't sit in their thinking and the

1171
01:01:10,551 --> 01:01:12,490
theater,
what the hell are those animals doing?

1172
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,770
Gathering around the Rock and the fact
that you're not sitting there thinking

1173
01:01:15,771 --> 01:01:19,040
that is an indication that you're
following the archetypical trail of the

1174
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:22,040
story.
It makes sense to you that a diverse

1175
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:24,390
bunch of drawings of animals would,
you know,

1176
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,800
come together around a rock.
That makes sense.

1177
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:29,900
Why?
Well,

1178
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:34,880
it had something to do with our,
our dawn higher proclivity and the fact

1179
01:01:34,881 --> 01:01:38,450
that we can recognize a,
an authority and an authority structure

1180
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:42,230
and we know how to interact with them.
And so these aren't animals after all,

1181
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:44,300
they're here.
There are people,

1182
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,140
while they're not cause their drawings,
but they're certainly not animals.

1183
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:50,840
They're not acting like him.
So,

1184
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,140
or they're acting like half human,
half animals.

1185
01:01:58,690 --> 01:01:59,020
Great.
Right

1186
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:00,700
now.
Who's that little guy?

1187
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,450
Okay.
What?

1188
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:06,880
What's he good for?
Information.

1189
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,440
Yes.
Why?

1190
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,010
Why is he did frequent aging and so,
so what,

1191
01:02:12,011 --> 01:02:16,030
why is that relevant?
You can get up there way the hell up

1192
01:02:16,031 --> 01:02:18,130
there with the king.
Can't even see and he can see

1193
01:02:18,131 --> 01:02:20,890
everything.
It's horses.

1194
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:22,320
Argh.
That's exactly right.

1195
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:24,690
That's the,
that's the Egyptian I that says pay

1196
01:02:24,691 --> 01:02:27,140
attention.
And so the birdies,

1197
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:31,170
the divert his attention fundamentally.
So,

1198
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:35,550
and the king by the same for the bird,
he's a little ratty.

1199
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:36,570
Burton,
he's kind of funny.

1200
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,480
I think he's,
he's not English comedian so he's a bit

1201
01:02:39,481 --> 01:02:43,950
of a comical character but the king,
the king will listen to him.

1202
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:48,750
And so that shows that this king is
properly humble king because it's just a

1203
01:02:48,751 --> 01:02:51,270
stupid bird and you could like fight it
and half in one bite,

1204
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:54,530
which is kind of what scar trump
threatens to do cause scarred is want to

1205
01:02:54,531 --> 01:02:57,000
pay attention cause then he'd figured
out who he was.

1206
01:02:57,730 --> 01:03:00,330
So but the king he'll pay attention to
even,

1207
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:05,070
you know this is also why in fairy tales
it's often the youngest son,

1208
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:07,950
the oldest son is usually the one who
everyone likes and admires.

1209
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:09,270
You know,
he's like the football,

1210
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:12,520
you'd like to football quarterback,
you know,

1211
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:15,090
of the fairytale.
And the younger son is like,

1212
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:20,130
well he's kind of little weaselly
useless guide and the older son always

1213
01:03:20,131 --> 01:03:22,160
fails.
And then usually the second son fails

1214
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:23,520
to,
and it's usually because they're

1215
01:03:23,521 --> 01:03:24,870
arrogant.
And then the third son,

1216
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:26,910
he's so clueless,
he doesn't know what to do,

1217
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:29,070
but they kicked them out because they
just assume get rid of him and,

1218
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,770
and you know,
why not let them go and you don't want

1219
01:03:31,771 --> 01:03:34,320
them around anyways.
And so he wanted out in the bush and you

1220
01:03:34,321 --> 01:03:36,180
know,
he comes across out of nome or something

1221
01:03:36,181 --> 01:03:36,601
that,
you know,

1222
01:03:36,601 --> 01:03:38,100
it's like you just ignore it.

1223
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,280
The other brothers did,
but he doesn't know what the hell he's

1224
01:03:41,281 --> 01:03:43,740
doing.
So the talks to many thanks while our

1225
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,110
plans,
we'll talk to this known,

1226
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:47,550
you know,
then the gnome tells them what to do

1227
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:50,790
and,
and then then the youngest son wins.

1228
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:54,240
And that's an archetypal story too.
It's like if you don't know what you're

1229
01:03:54,241 --> 01:03:57,870
doing,
don't be so sure that you know who to

1230
01:03:57,871 --> 01:03:59,250
ignore.
Now,

1231
01:03:59,251 --> 01:04:01,590
that's our very,
very useful piece of advice.

1232
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:04,440
But then you might ask yourself,
how do you know when you don't know what

1233
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:07,860
you're doing?
So do you have any thoughts on that?

1234
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:10,530
How is it that you would know if you
didn't know what you were doing?

1235
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:15,900
Yes,
but there's one that's very good,

1236
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:18,270
that's very good.
But there's one more thing that goes

1237
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:19,800
along with that all and I'll just add
it.

1238
01:04:19,801 --> 01:04:23,640
Cause it's lets you know a bit of a trek
and substance and it's bothering you,

1239
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:26,130
right?
So there's,

1240
01:04:26,131 --> 01:04:30,030
there's failure plus suffering.
Now one of the inferences that you can

1241
01:04:30,031 --> 01:04:35,031
draw from failure plus suffering is that
nature is your enemy and you're a victim

1242
01:04:36,601 --> 01:04:41,601
of the great father.
He's like very standard presupposition,

1243
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:45,200
especially of young people because of
course you're failing here young.

1244
01:04:45,201 --> 01:04:46,420
It's like what the hell?
You know,

1245
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:49,050
you know when you go to a whole bunch of
things to learn yet before you can be

1246
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:51,840
successful.
But you know,

1247
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:55,230
but it's an art that's an architectural
situation in large part.

1248
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,113
Okay,
so

1249
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:06,943
great,
great.

1250
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:10,270
So now we see the cake.
So what do we notice about the cake?

1251
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:15,070
It's kind of a tough looking guy.
He's not one of these defeated lobster

1252
01:05:15,071 --> 01:05:17,600
types of lion kings.
He's like an upstanding of,

1253
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,033
okay,

1254
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:25,320
you saw he was also in the sun,
right?

1255
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:29,250
So if the sun shines on the king,
and that's because the king is awake and

1256
01:05:29,251 --> 01:05:31,710
the sun also illuminates it.
You may not know this,

1257
01:05:31,711 --> 01:05:33,840
but you have,
you've seen coins,

1258
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,540
of course silver coin,
that's the mood.

1259
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:40,620
The head of the Queen was the head of
the queen on the mood and gold coins

1260
01:05:40,621 --> 01:05:42,870
with the sun.
And so we're hanging clothes.

1261
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:45,660
And the idea is that the thing that's at
the top,

1262
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,510
it's like the sun.
And why is it like the sun?

1263
01:05:48,830 --> 01:05:52,170
Because the sun is consciousness.
And why is this unconsciousness?

1264
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:55,200
Because you're awake during the day.
Now there's a bunch of other reasons as

1265
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:57,480
well.
The Sun is also the thing that defeats

1266
01:05:57,481 --> 01:05:59,580
darkness and that's what the king should
be.

1267
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,260
And that's right in their coins.
And they're simple.

1268
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:03,540
They're symbols of value.

1269
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:05,940
Okay,

1270
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:07,590
so they're all on the wind is blowing on
it,

1271
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:10,530
but just not bothering you by the way.
But that's a,

1272
01:06:10,531 --> 01:06:12,840
that's a divine wind.
That's PNEUMA.

1273
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:16,890
PNEUMA that's spirit because spirit is
often win as an inspiration and

1274
01:06:16,891 --> 01:06:18,960
respiration.
That's all spirit.

1275
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:22,170
So spirit came here,
comes to the bird.

1276
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,330
It's not lunch.
It's his friend.

1277
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:39,150
[inaudible]
[inaudible].

1278
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:51,320
Now who in the world is that?
That's Carl Young.

1279
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:11,320
Who's that?
The Virgin Mary and Christ.

1280
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:15,520
That's the virgin and the sun.
It's a way older idea.

1281
01:07:15,521 --> 01:07:18,490
Then the Christian idea.
It's been around forever.

1282
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:21,520
Why?
Because any culture that doesn't worship

1283
01:07:21,521 --> 01:07:26,521
the mother and child dies obviously.
So it's an archetypal image of value.

1284
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:31,120
Clearly.
Obviously you don't have to think about

1285
01:07:31,121 --> 01:07:31,954
that much.

1286
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:35,960
So,
oh,

1287
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:45,403
oh yeah.

1288
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:48,813
I love that.

1289
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:51,810
There's,
there's two things always happen when I

1290
01:07:51,811 --> 01:07:54,960
showed this always,
because it evokes archetypal emotions.

1291
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:58,200
So you were all going nick invoice from
that cute noises,

1292
01:07:58,201 --> 01:08:00,690
right?
What kind of noises are those

1293
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,160
babies?
Like that noise.

1294
01:08:05,161 --> 01:08:07,550
That's why you're making that noise.
It's like the baby like that though.

1295
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:10,740
I still smile at you and then you'll
take that the navy likes you even though

1296
01:08:10,741 --> 01:08:12,300
it's just a survival mechanism.

1297
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:16,040
It

1298
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:16,873
is,
but the baby.

1299
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:20,780
So what?
Why is that cute?

1300
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:22,070
First of all,
it's not real.

1301
01:08:22,071 --> 01:08:22,930
You might notice that.
Yeah.

1302
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:28,110
Why is that cute?
What means of cute?

1303
01:08:29,370 --> 01:08:30,151
They guys.
Yeah,

1304
01:08:30,151 --> 01:08:31,020
that's a good one.
Yeah,

1305
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,100
that's,
that's part of it.

1306
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:36,760
Aliens have big eyes too though.
What else?

1307
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:39,190
It's kindly.
Yeah.

1308
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:40,360
Yeah.
So it's a Mammalian,

1309
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:42,580
that's how small the lizard,
you know,

1310
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:45,010
so that's helpful.
It's got first so you can pet it sort of

1311
01:08:45,011 --> 01:08:47,890
invites be petted and it moves like
this.

1312
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:49,560
It was like,
that's so cute.

1313
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,140
You know,
that little polar bear.

1314
01:08:52,141 --> 01:08:53,850
I did watch a little bit of that,
like,

1315
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,400
that's like pathologically acute,
that thing.

1316
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:57,780
And it's,
you know,

1317
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,850
part of it is,
it's sort of wobbling around and it's

1318
01:08:59,851 --> 01:09:01,890
like the poor thing.
It's trying to walk.

1319
01:09:01,891 --> 01:09:03,510
It's having a rough time and everybody
thinks,

1320
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,373
oh,
that's so cute.

1321
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:06,420
That was happening to you.

1322
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:08,880
You wouldn't think it was cute.
But you know,

1323
01:09:08,881 --> 01:09:09,840
animals,
animals,

1324
01:09:10,690 --> 01:09:13,810
first range of mammalian species,
no cute.

1325
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:17,830
You know,
and they tend to respond to like big

1326
01:09:17,831 --> 01:09:20,590
guide,
symmetrical small nose,

1327
01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:22,390
flat faced,
uh,

1328
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:26,860
helpless movement cuddly and not eat it.
Right.

1329
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:27,480
It's,
it's,

1330
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,020
so,
it's an inhibitory,

1331
01:09:29,350 --> 01:09:32,320
it's a set of inhibitory perceptual
mechanisms in large part.

1332
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:35,200
But since we're also mammals,
you better think that thing is cute

1333
01:09:35,201 --> 01:09:38,620
because you're going to be taken care of
it for a long time.

1334
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,920
So you know there has to be a deep,
deep,

1335
01:09:41,921 --> 01:09:45,460
deep biological connection.
It's forged almost immediately.

1336
01:09:45,461 --> 01:09:48,760
And of course that's mediated in women
in particular by Oxytocin,

1337
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:52,120
which is released in tremendous
quantities after birth and during

1338
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:53,560
breastfeeding.
So,

1339
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,110
and it's necessary,
you know,

1340
01:09:56,111 --> 01:09:59,320
it turns on new circuits and there are
circuits you need cause like one day

1341
01:09:59,321 --> 01:10:01,240
you're not a mother and then the next
day you are,

1342
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:04,120
that's not,
you are not the same creature at that

1343
01:10:04,121 --> 01:10:06,670
point and you don't want to even be the
same creature.

1344
01:10:06,671 --> 01:10:08,140
You're pretty happy about the whole
issue.

1345
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:09,213
Hopefully.

1346
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:23,690
So that's very interesting image j
because first of all he was playing with

1347
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:25,510
the little lion king with those balls
and they're,

1348
01:10:25,511 --> 01:10:27,850
so there's sort of globe thing that's
attracting them.

1349
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:30,550
So it was like representations of the
sun and you might think,

1350
01:10:30,551 --> 01:10:33,930
well you're just reading that into it.
But then of course this happens.

1351
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:37,600
It's like this is,
this is like he's breaking open the sun

1352
01:10:37,601 --> 01:10:40,660
to release the essence of the sun onto
the little lion king.

1353
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:43,630
And he is because the sun represents
gold.

1354
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,960
Gold is pure gold,
won't mix with any other metals.

1355
01:10:46,961 --> 01:10:48,670
So that's partly why it's a symbol of
value.

1356
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:52,930
It's a noble metal.
The Sun is made out of gold so to speak,

1357
01:10:52,931 --> 01:10:56,890
except it's like medical from a symbolic
perspective because it's like the gold

1358
01:10:56,891 --> 01:11:00,640
of higher consciousness and it feed
dumped on the middle lion king because

1359
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:04,540
for the tribe sake and then maybe even
for the sake of the whole ecosystem

1360
01:11:04,541 --> 01:11:06,880
around the tribe,
that king better be awake.

1361
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:10,940
So that's what this Carl Young baboons
here is trying to get.

1362
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:16,140
Get going.
Okay,

1363
01:11:35,411 --> 01:11:37,450
so now you notice two things.
Lovely.

1364
01:11:37,451 --> 01:11:40,030
This is lovely.
Very well put together seeing third

1365
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:42,280
bottle.
So the animal is started to lift up your

1366
01:11:42,281 --> 01:11:45,130
head so you can get the sense of
heightened interest in the music is

1367
01:11:45,131 --> 01:11:47,630
starting to rise a little bit in speed
up in camp a better,

1368
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:49,840
you know what?
Something's going to happen here at

1369
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:52,570
pinnacle of the,
of the,

1370
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:53,793
of the rock there.

1371
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:31,410
Brilliant.
This little thing was now represents

1372
01:12:35,411 --> 01:12:39,040
what will become the guiding
consciousness of the land is revealed

1373
01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:41,740
and the automatic response of all the
animals,

1374
01:12:41,741 --> 01:12:45,010
it's first to file.
So they're in awe as they should be.

1375
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:47,730
And then to celebrate and then that's,
you know,

1376
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:49,630
well that's pretty good.
It's pretty impressive.

1377
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:53,860
But then God himself gets in the act
because just at the opportune time,

1378
01:12:54,010 --> 01:12:57,360
the sun breaks and shines on the little
lion at the same time.

1379
01:12:57,390 --> 01:13:00,370
They moved the music up like they
changed the key of the music.

1380
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:04,900
And so if it causes an up swelling of
emotion and that's,

1381
01:13:04,901 --> 01:13:07,030
y'all would call that if,
if,

1382
01:13:07,031 --> 01:13:10,300
and when that happened,
that's what he would call a synchronous

1383
01:13:10,301 --> 01:13:12,340
event.
So that's a demonstration of a

1384
01:13:12,341 --> 01:13:15,520
synchronous event.
It's where they're very rare.

1385
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:18,070
These things there from a union
perspective,

1386
01:13:18,071 --> 01:13:22,180
they're there.
They occur in very emotionally intense

1387
01:13:22,181 --> 01:13:26,770
situations where they context,
the external context of the occurrence

1388
01:13:26,771 --> 01:13:29,140
seems to match the meaning of the
occurrence.

1389
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:32,350
So anyways,
whether or not you believe such things

1390
01:13:32,351 --> 01:13:34,960
are possible,
that is exactly what this little film

1391
01:13:34,961 --> 01:13:36,100
clip is trying to demonstrate.

1392
01:13:58,390 --> 01:13:59,830
Yup.
Pretty decent or right.

1393
01:13:59,831 --> 01:14:03,110
So you go up the animals,
you've got the stone hierarchy,

1394
01:14:03,111 --> 01:14:05,680
that's a pyramid.
You've got the thing that's at the top

1395
01:14:05,681 --> 01:14:07,720
of it,
just like the little pyramid on the back

1396
01:14:07,721 --> 01:14:09,790
of the American dollar bill with the eye
on talk.

1397
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,390
Exactly the same.
And part of the idea is that the thing

1398
01:14:13,391 --> 01:14:17,260
that's at the very top of the pyramid
isn't part of the fear of it.

1399
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:19,870
So it's not stolen.
A little lion king,

1400
01:14:19,871 --> 01:14:23,350
he isn't stone.
He's the thing that produces stone as he

1401
01:14:23,351 --> 01:14:24,940
moves through time,
right?

1402
01:14:24,941 --> 01:14:27,580
Because he's the culture producing
force.

1403
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:32,880
And so this is setup to demonstrate
visually that at the center of being is

1404
01:14:32,981 --> 01:14:37,780
culture at the top of culture is the
culture producing process or force.

1405
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:42,130
And that's the illuminated savior.
And that's what all the animals worship

1406
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:44,530
instinctively.
It's like,

1407
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:46,390
yes,
that's right.

1408
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:49,270
That's how it goes.
We'll see you on

1409
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:52,790
Tuesday.
Okay.
