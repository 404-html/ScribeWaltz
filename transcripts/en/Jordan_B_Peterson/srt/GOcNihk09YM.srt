1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,133
Yeah,

2
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,860
maybe you're 35 years old and you've 
never had a job,

3
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,513
and one of the things that's stopping 
you is that you're so damn nervous that 

4
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,253
you can't pick up a phone and use it 
because if anything unexpected happens 

5
00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:47,240
while you're talking,
you get scared so badly,

6
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:51,020
you have to hang up and so that would be
characteristic of somebody with a severe

7
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:53,180
anxiety disorder.
So what do you do with that person?

8
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,580
So you say,
are they afraid of the phone?

9
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:56,563
Well,
no.

10
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,760
What are they afraid of?
Well,

11
00:00:58,761 --> 00:01:01,550
they're afraid of a normally is in human
interaction,

12
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:02,384
right?
They're afraid of something unexpected 

13
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:04,304
happening while they're trying to impose
a structure and the reason they're 

14
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:07,304
afraid of that is because they never 
learned that they were capable of 

15
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:13,880
dealing with the emergence of something 
new on an ongoing basis,

16
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:17,900
which meant that
while which meant in all likelihood,

17
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:18,734
that when they were children,
they were so sheltered from any contact 

18
00:01:22,311 --> 00:01:23,144
with those aspects of being the 
transcend knowledge that they never 

19
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:27,194
learned,
that there was something inside of them 

20
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:33,131
that would reveal itself if they were 
allowed the opportunity to encounter the

21
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:35,900
unknown,
to encounter fear them,

22
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:36,734
to master it,
then to extract out something of value 

23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,260
so they can't get a job because they 
can't use the phone and it isn't because

24
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:43,550
they can't use the phone.

25
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,440
Right?
It's a deeper story than not.

26
00:01:45,441 --> 00:01:46,274
It's because they're terrified of this 
and they have no idea that they have 

27
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,740
some resource they could draw on to 
combat it and you could say,

28
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:57,110
well,
we can teach them to use the phone,

29
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:57,950
right?
Say,

30
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,491
well,
you know,

31
00:01:58,491 --> 00:01:59,324
here's a.
here's a repertoire of stock lines that 

32
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:02,870
you might use,
you know,

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,713
like small talk at a party.
And that would increase what they know 

34
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,470
and enabled them to deal with the 
unknown.

35
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:10,370
Or You could say,
look,

36
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:11,204
you know,
relax a little bit when the person says 

37
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:15,050
something on the phone that you don't 
understand,

38
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,710
pause a little bit.
Think about what they're saying.

39
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,200
Pay attention to them.
Allow yourself the luxury of formulating

40
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:23,240
a response.
You'll do fine,

41
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,940
and even if you do it badly the first 
half a dozen times,

42
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,240
well you'll learn.
Eventually the person derives from that.

43
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,150
The notion that not only can they cope 
on the phone,

44
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,530
but that possibly there's more to them 
that originally met the eye.

45
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,170
We come into the world equipped with an 
array of possibilities and limitations.

46
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,103
Those possibilities and limitations are 
expressed most particularly in our 

47
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:57,410
physical form.
The fact that we have a specific kind of

48
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:02,110
embodied form that us to do certain 
things and that also doesn't allow us to

49
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:06,670
do certain other things loud too,
as pointed out that

50
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,950
it's the space inside a part that makes 
the part worthwhile.

51
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,843
And what he means by that is that
those things that limit you give you as 

52
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:22,000
much form and possibility as those 
things that enable you.

53
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,003
What that means more broadly is the fact
that you come to a given circumstance 

54
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:29,050
with a set of possibilities and a set of
limitations.

55
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,873
It's that that allows you to impose form
on what you encounter so that the whole 

56
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,374
notion of forum is attendant in some 
peculiar way that we don't really 

57
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:42,130
understand yet on the necessity of 
limitation.

58
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,993
And I think the best way to understand 
that or to begin to understand that is 

59
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:47,920
to give some consideration to the notion
of a game.

60
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,200
So for example,
if you're playing chess,

61
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,650
there's a virtually unlimited number of 
things you can do and only a very narrow

62
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,590
number of things that you can do.
Yet when you're playing chess,

63
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,723
the arbitrary limitations that are 
imposed on each piece don't seem to be 

64
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:04,803
unfair in any sort of cosmic sense.
They seem to be part of the structure 

65
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:08,254
that enables you to actually play the 
game without the imposition of those 

66
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:12,934
rules,
which are of course relatively 

67
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:14,710
arbitrary.
And their structure,

68
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:19,711
there wouldn't be a game at all.
Now it's clear that for human beings,

69
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:21,874
games and fantasy for that matter,
shade up into reality so that the game 

70
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:26,884
structures that we engage in and the 
fantasy structures that we use to 

71
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,740
undergird our stories and our pretend 
play,

72
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:36,580
say when we're children shade 
imperceptibly into real life,

73
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,473
we we play games because there's 
something about games that make them 

74
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:41,584
deeply analogous to what we do in day to
day situations and that means the 

75
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:46,414
observation that the rules of a game 
actually make the game possible is an 

76
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:53,890
observation that's broadly applicable to
consideration of your own limitation.

77
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,713
Some of those limitations and 
possibilities take the form of emotions 

78
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:02,740
and motivations and we know I think 
incontrovertibly

79
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,073
regardless of the claims of social 
scientists who are more relativist in 

80
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:08,794
their orientation,
that human beings come into the world 

81
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:14,050
with a standard set of biological 
predispositions,

82
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,020
emotions and motivations.
And furthermore,

83
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:19,830
I think we know that it's the fact of 
those shared emotions,

84
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,990
emotions and motivations that allow us 
to communicate at all.

85
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:28,963
And then imagine further that a 
consequence of that lengthy process of 

86
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,543
interpersonal negotiation is the 
emergence of a tremendously complicated 

87
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:38,624
game and not one that's arbitrary 
because the game has to have certain 

88
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:44,000
rules in order for it to be played at 
all.

89
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:46,760
So for example,
we know that even with rats,

90
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,733
if rats,
they like to engage in rough and tumble 

91
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:52,280
play,
and if you put two rats together,

92
00:05:52,281 --> 00:05:53,114
juvenile routes,
one route almost always dominates the 

93
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:56,624
other.
It only takes about 10 percent gain in 

94
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:02,490
weight on the part of one rap.
For it to be pretty much stable,

95
00:06:02,491 --> 00:06:03,324
he dominant and it's always the 
subordinate rat that introduces play or 

96
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,720
or,
or asks for play.

97
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,020
But it turns out that even among rats,
if the dominant rat pins or or,

98
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,630
or obtains victory over the subordinate 
route,

99
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,800
more than 70 percent of the time,
the subordinate rat will no longer play.

100
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,340
So then you could imagine likewise that 
if you're going to play a game with some

101
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:26,174
other person,
whether it's a game of fantasy or the 

102
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:32,720
actual chance to engage in some 
cooperative real world activity,

103
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,640
unless that person allows you a certain 
amount of space for the manifestation of

104
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:39,350
your own emotional and motivational 
needs,

105
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,090
you're not going to play the game with 
them,

106
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:41,924
right?
You're going to look for another game 

107
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,540
and that means that there's a certain 
set of difficult to describe constraints

108
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,374
for all of you on games that you're 
willing to play before you'll look for 

109
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:52,510
another one

110
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,343
again,

111
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,393
well,
and then you can start to conceive of 

112
00:07:00,221 --> 00:07:02,560
revolutionary tendencies in that sense,
right?

113
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,693
Imagine the human society that Scott so 
unstable that the vast majority of the 

114
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:10,870
citizens within that society are 
subjugated to starvation,

115
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:15,700
so the society never no longer provides 
their basic needs and constant tyranny.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,360
You could imagine as well that there's 
going to be an innate tendency among the

117
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:20,194
members of that society to start 
hypothesizing about what alternatives 

118
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:24,610
might be possible,
right?

119
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,444
To start dreaming about alternative 
societies and then also to take action 

120
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:29,734
if the situation becomes too extreme,
and I think this is part of the reason 

121
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:36,520
why you see stable mythological motifs 
across different cultures.

122
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,860
It's not so much like young sad that we 
have archetypes of what might constitute

123
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,590
social order deeply embedded in our 
unconscious.

124
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,693
I think this situation is more 
externalized in that in that what's 

125
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:52,600
biological is what we bring to the 
situation,

126
00:07:52,601 --> 00:07:56,110
our hopes and our desires and the fact 
that we have hopes and desires.

127
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,423
Now,
I think what happens with stories is 

128
00:07:58,631 --> 00:07:59,464
something like this is that as human 
societies increasing complexity and 

129
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:04,444
number so they become bigger and bigger 
and more and more people engage in the 

130
00:08:07,181 --> 00:08:08,014
negotiating process,
exchanging emotional and motivational 

131
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:14,020
information.
The pattern that the society takes,

132
00:08:14,021 --> 00:08:16,720
if it's going to be stable across long 
periods of time,

133
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,773
starts to become encoded in the stories.
So imagine you've got your emotions on 

134
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:24,130
your motivations.
You make your case no one,

135
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,173
10,000 other people do that over a 
thousand years and structure starts to 

136
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:31,900
emerge.
That satisfies more or less all of these

137
00:08:31,901 --> 00:08:36,190
emotions and motivational states and 
there's also recognizable as a pattern,

138
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,010
so then you could say,
for example,

139
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,450
considering a story like Moses and the 
imposition of the 10 commandments on the

140
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:52,220
ancient Hebrews prior to isn't in 
position of those 10 commandments,

141
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:55,220
and of course there were actually many 
more than 10 Moses,

142
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,780
according to the mythological story.
What was it?

143
00:08:57,781 --> 00:08:58,614
Spent years,
literally years adjudicating conflict 

144
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:05,190
between the people that he was leading 
18 hours a day.

145
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:07,530
They'd come to him with their various 
problems saying,

146
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,960
we have a dispute.
How should it be settled?

147
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,110
And he'd satellite.
Well imagine doing that for 10 years,

148
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:13,944
right?
Becoming an expert at evaluating what 

149
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:20,340
constitutes an appropriate solution to 
an emotional problem between two people.

150
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,503
Imagine as well that as a consequence of
doing that for such a long period of 

151
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:25,644
time,
you start to became becoming able to 

152
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:27,984
abstract out lawful regularities in the 
manner in which people have to interact 

153
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:34,650
in order for peace to be maintained.

154
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,190
Imagine further that those could be 
codified in stories,

155
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:39,024
but even more codafide as law.
Eventually when consciousness became 

156
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,290
capable of grasping explicitly the 
nature of the interactions,

157
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,363
so my point is a point very much like 
niches because Nisha said at the end of 

158
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:51,594
the 19th century that it's a mistake to 
presume that most of our philosophies 

159
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:56,424
are rational in nature and I think 
that's a mistake that characterizes 

160
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,473
western philosophical thinking.
At least at least since the 

161
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:03,714
enlightenment.
It's a mistake to assume that there was 

162
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:07,014
a chaotic social state upon which a 
rational order was imposed as a 

163
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:11,754
consequence of rational action.
It's much more reasonable to presuppose 

164
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,713
that the order emerged naturally over 
lengthy periods of time and then was 

165
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:23,700
interpreted and codified and given 
structure in a secondary manner.

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,170
And so when I'm trying to outline for 
you in in large part is the processes by

167
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:29,760
which that order comes to be.

168
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,920
So you say,
first it's behavioral,

169
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:32,754
emotional,
motivational people and even animals 

170
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,083
communicate in a way that makes their 
motivational and emotional needs known 

171
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:41,100
to one another.
So even among wolves and chimpanzees and

172
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,380
and any kind of lower order social 
animal,

173
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,423
you have the emergence of dominance 
hierarchies fundamentally which are 

174
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:51,990
stable solutions to the entire set of 
emotional and motivational problems that

175
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:52,843
beset the group and no one would ever 
say that the emergence of a chimpanzee 

176
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,060
dominance hierarchy is a consequence of 
rational deliberation.

177
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,403
So then imagine chimpanzees,
get the power to watch what they're 

178
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:04,824
doing and to start to represent it and 
then imagine furthermore that that 

179
00:11:07,771 --> 00:11:08,604
representation takes the form of stories
and then laws and then you have some 

180
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:15,030
idea about how human social order comes 
to be.

181
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,480
And this is an exciting possibility for 
me because it offers,

182
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,760
it offers the potential solution to one 
major question,

183
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:26,580
which is how is it that people should 
act?

184
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,960
And because we're essentially 
rationalist in our presuppositions,

185
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:33,780
we believe that there are rationalist 
solutions to that,

186
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:34,614
but the solutions may be something that 
are much more akin to biological 

187
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:38,454
solutions.

188
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,543
First,
I want you to consider the following 

189
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:47,670
hypothesis.
Okay,

190
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:49,770
so we're going to make the 
presupposition.

191
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,320
A couple of presuppositions that I don't
think are unreasonable.

192
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:53,154
First is that we are essentially animals
that we've evolved in a Darwinian 

193
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:59,290
fashion
and second,

194
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:02,920
that the consequence of that evolution,
much of which was pre-cognitive,

195
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:03,754
right,
did with it w we were around as 

196
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,390
creatures before we were capable of 
thinking in words,

197
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,463
say,
much of that evolutionary history has 

198
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:11,950
conditioned the manner in which we 
think.

199
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,440
So we think more like biological 
entities.

200
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:15,274
Then we think like computers or we think
more like biological entities than we 

201
00:12:18,311 --> 00:12:19,144
think like rational machines.
And of course we already know that 

202
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,893
rational machines cannot think very well
except in very boundaried environments 

203
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,033
because they don't have access to and 
embodied structure or to emotions and 

204
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:31,690
motivations.
So let's.

205
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,060
So then you might say,
well,

206
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,463
why is it that like in the Mesopotamian 
Egyptian creation myths are most 

207
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:41,314
fundamental representations of the world
tend to take story for him and that not 

208
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:47,014
only do they take story form,
but they tend to utilize certain kinds 

209
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:51,274
of categories.

210
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,170
Now,
I've showed you this diagram before.

211
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,453
Um,
this represents what I think are the 

212
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:57,544
three cardinal categories of experience.
So there's the great mother who was 

213
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:05,411
holding the world in her hand here and 
inside her subordinate in a sense is the

214
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:06,544
great father.
This is a Christian representation 

215
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,050
obviously,
and then this tragic son,

216
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,243
of course in the crowd here representing
society is adoring the figure of the 

217
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,033
tragic hero here because they regard his
motive being as necessary to their own 

218
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,760
salvation,
so to speak,

219
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:26,680
their own proper motive living.
Okay?

220
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:27,514
So then you think,
well why these characters and I offer 

221
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:31,114
you this possibility is first of all,
every human being that's ever lived has 

222
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:40,720
lived in an environment characterized by
the presence of these three entities,

223
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:42,130
right?
We have mothers,

224
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,980
we have fathers,
and we exist as individuals.

225
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,450
And then you think,
well,

226
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,990
when you're a child and you begin to 
comprehend the world,

227
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,853
the outside world,
everything outside of the family is of 

228
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:54,520
course vague and ill defined,
right?

229
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,353
Nonexistent in a sense and to all there 
is for you to observe is the mother who 

230
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,830
for you really is the whole world and 
the father,

231
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:04,664
a a secondary source of comfort and 
troubled perhaps and the fact of your 

232
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:10,540
own individuality.
And so you say,

233
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,870
well that's true from the perspective of
individual development,

234
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:16,180
but then if you go way,
way back in history,

235
00:14:16,181 --> 00:14:17,014
maybe 500,000 years when our cognitive 
capacities were first starting to 

236
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,980
develop and we were trying to figure out
what the world was really like,

237
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,053
what categories would we have at our 
disposal to start to modify and change 

238
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:30,214
in order to represent the outside world?
And then you might think you can only 

239
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:36,940
talk about what you don't know in terms 
that you know.

240
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,630
And since for the child,
the mother is the world.

241
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,553
It isn't.
It isn't observed to presume that for 

242
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:49,090
the human being the world is the mother 
first as a projection,

243
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:49,300
right?

244
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,380
As a,
as a,

245
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,710
as a,
an April are cognitive Schema.

246
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,773
The hypothesis being the natural world,
which of course does manifest itself in 

247
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:02,264
truth in the mother,
partakes in many ways of the same 

248
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:05,834
properties as the mother.
It's a working hypothesis just like you 

249
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:14,261
might presume if you date a new woman,
that she has aspects of your sister.

250
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,500
All things considered aspects of your 
mother given that they were also female.

251
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,920
You take what you know to represent what
you don't know,

252
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,343
so we use our fundamental social 
cognitive categories initially to 

253
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:31,940
portray the world and the world's 
nature's pours,

254
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,620
traded personified or metaphorical form.
And so then the question is what are the

255
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:39,020
primary categories?
Well,

256
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:39,854
we have three of them here,
but they're not the only three because 

257
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:44,270
this is all good.
This category system,

258
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:46,370
the benevolent mother,
the benevolent father,

259
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,383
and the hero.
While we know the world is not only 

260
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:51,290
benevolent,
it's also malevolent,

261
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,124
or at least we can say that because 
we're equipped with certain emotional 

262
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,610
possibilities in certain motivational 
possibilities,

263
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,140
the,
the,

264
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,023
the probability that we will encounter 
despair and frustration and 

265
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:05,624
disappointment and anxiety is just as 
real as the possibility that we will 

266
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:12,320
encounter elation and hope and 
satisfaction.

267
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,390
So for us,
the world is by Vaillant.

268
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,640
It takes with one hand and gives with 
the other,

269
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:17,474
and that's true for the natural world 
which produces us and destroys us as it 

270
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:22,274
is for the social world,
which fosters our development and 

271
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:25,304
crushes.
Our individuality and as well for the 

272
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:30,930
individual who in many regards is,
is admirable a creature.

273
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:31,764
As you could hope ever to proposed,
and at the same time someone who's 

274
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,090
capable of unbelievable depths of 
depravity,

275
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,703
so
a world that's not only divided into 

276
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:43,544
three fundamental categories,
but each category divided into a 

277
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:52,090
structure that's essentially ambivalent 
and its fundamental element,

278
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:56,900
and of course that poses the central 
existential problem for human existence,

279
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:57,734
doesn't it?
I mean we're faced with the vagaries of 

280
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:01,184
the natural world and what we don't 
understand the vagaries of the social 

281
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:04,634
world and it's often arbitrary and 
unreasonable demands on us and the fact 

282
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:08,534
of our capacity for Tristan 
transcendence tied to our own 

283
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,654
vulnerability and you could say 
perfectly reasonably that regardless of 

284
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:15,884
where you're situated in time and space,
those are basically your problems and 

285
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:19,694
your goal through life.
Your path through life is going to be 

286
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,143
characterized by the solutions you 
either come up with or don't come up 

287
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,410
with to that set of problems.

288
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:33,803
Okay,
so there's one more categorical element 

289
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:37,314
that complicates this picture and I 
think in many ways it's the most 

290
00:17:40,231 --> 00:17:44,260
difficult thing there is to grasp.
So we'll take a shot at it first.

291
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:48,000
And I've showed you this representation 
before.

292
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:52,110
This is the of chaos,
and you can think of the dragon of chaos

293
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:55,440
as a symbol of totality,
and furthermore,

294
00:17:55,441 --> 00:18:00,441
you can think of it in relationship
to this structure

295
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,400
as the source of this structure

296
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,643
for even as the source of all structure.
So you see in the Sumerian creation 

297
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:12,480
myth,
for example,

298
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:14,310
the character of Thai amount,
right,

299
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:18,720
and I told you that word tie.
Matt is associated with the later Hebrew

300
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:20,610
word tail,
which means chaos,

301
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:22,590
and Tom is the chaos that,
yeah,

302
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,800
well makes order out of,
makes the world out of.

303
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,643
So the idea lurking behind the Sumerian 
creation myth and then later lurking 

304
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:34,230
behind the entire edifice of Judaism,
Christianity and Islam for that matter,

305
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,243
is that something that can be best 
represented by this figure is best 

306
00:18:39,061 --> 00:18:42,240
conceptualized as the ground of 
everything that exists.

307
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,430
Now,
what in the world can that mean?

308
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,650
Well,
it means something like this.

309
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,310
Let's look at the concrete,
metaphorical representation.

310
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,890
First of all,
you have a kind of totality here,

311
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:53,724
right?
You have a thing that can live by 

312
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,480
devouring itself,
so it has no need of anything outside of

313
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:00,570
it.

314
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,370
In fact,
there is nothing outside of it.

315
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,443
It's a figure of absolute totality and 
it's characterized by a strange 

316
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,580
intermixture of metaphorical real 
representations of matter,

317
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,260
because a snake is something that crawls
on the ground and spirit because a wayne

318
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:17,094
serpent is something that can fly and 
therefore partakes of the metaphorical 

319
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:22,440
realm of Heaven,
heaven and earth,

320
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:23,274
right totality,
Yin and Yang from the Dallas 

321
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:26,454
perspective.
That's the entire world and it's also 

322
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:29,724
something that's characterized by the 
capacity for transformation because a 

323
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:33,634
snake can shed its skin and be reborn,
so it's something that's constantly 

324
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:42,230
renewing itself despite its absolutely 
archaic age and it's also something that

325
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,093
presents a terrible danger and 
tremendous opportunity because a dragon 

326
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:50,250
is something that will burn you if you 
get anywhere near it,

327
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,180
but also hoards a treasure that's more 
valuable than anything else.

328
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:59,220
Eliana has pointed out that in 
traditional classic creation myths,

329
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,160
the Sumerian myth being one example,
when the hero,

330
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:06,450
whoever the hero is first encounters the
great dragon of chaos,

331
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,880
he either runs away or is paralyzed by 
fright.

332
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,133
The world in itself is a complex array 
of patterns and those patterns manifest 

333
00:20:18,781 --> 00:20:19,614
themselves in space and they manifest 
themselves in time and I think the best 

334
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:23,934
way to get a grip on what those patterns
might be like is to think of them in 

335
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:30,330
terms of music and I think that's what 
music represents.

336
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,170
Music is this complex,
three dimensional structure,

337
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,153
full of interwoven patterns of different
dimensions and and and length that 

338
00:20:39,301 --> 00:20:43,020
expends itself over time and if you 
listen to a piece of music,

339
00:20:43,021 --> 00:20:43,854
you can concentrate on one instrument or
another or you can concentrate on a 

340
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:49,420
phrase.
You can concentrate on the entire melody

341
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:50,254
or the voice.
You can parse out different elements 

342
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:52,984
from the complex background and that's 
especially the case with very 

343
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:56,494
sophisticated orchestral music rights 
which is susceptible to multiple 

344
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,820
reinterpretations and multiple 
encounters because of its complexity.

345
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,103
And this is to say only that what you 
look at is far more complicated than 

346
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:11,440
what you see or to say.

347
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,273
Alternatively,
that there's more information in 

348
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:18,970
anything you perceive than you could 
ever get complete access to.

349
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,980
And that's partly because it's partly 
because of your perceptual systems.

350
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:28,840
Delude you so we think you look with 
your eyes or with your other senses,

351
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,650
but that's only true when you're looking
at what you already know what to look at

352
00:21:32,651 --> 00:21:36,490
right when you've already built 
perceptual machinery that enables you to

353
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:37,324
detect a particular object,
but when you're looking at what you 

354
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:44,020
don't know what to look at,
the way you look is by getting nervous,

355
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:44,854
right?
It's not.

356
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:46,840
It's not precisely a perceptual 
function.

357
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:50,950
It's something much more deeper and 
primordial than that and it's more like,

358
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,413
oh no.
Something that I cannot categorize 

359
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:55,834
either perceptually or cognitively,
something that I do not know how to 

360
00:21:58,001 --> 00:22:02,350
respond to has just occurred,
and the first categorization is this.

361
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,500
That's it.
There's,

362
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,710
there's nothing under that.
It's merely

363
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,163
fear plus heightened attention and that 
prepares the ground for constructing a 

364
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:16,831
more detailed representation,
but that first encounter,

365
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,020
that's the encounter with the dragon of 
chaos.

366
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,530
So then you take this figure,
the source of all things,

367
00:22:28,531 --> 00:22:31,080
the,
the Dow in some ways,

368
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,211
and you'll say,
well,

369
00:22:33,211 --> 00:22:38,211
how does it manifest itself?
And the answer to that is something like

370
00:22:40,081 --> 00:22:40,914
this,
and we see this both in the in the 

371
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,860
Mesopotamian and the Egyptian myths that
I described to you.

372
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,740
The first division of the great dragon 
of chaos,

373
00:22:52,741 --> 00:22:56,970
or the primordial egg is always into to 
subordinate elements.

374
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,540
The great father and the great mother.
Why is that?

375
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:01,643
Well,
it's illustrative of a fundamental of 

376
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,110
the fundamental binary nature of 
existence.

377
00:23:07,111 --> 00:23:12,111
I guess partly you could say,
if you're a cognizant being,

378
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:17,530
a defined delimited being what you 
perceive always has a binary structure.

379
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,673
There's the aspect of you that 
structured enough to allow the 

380
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,430
perceiving.
That's what you know,

381
00:23:23,431 --> 00:23:24,264
that's,
that's the manner in which you are 

382
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,250
structured so that you can even see.

383
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:28,803
You can even formulate a perception 
something a child builds up over time 

384
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,310
from the primordial aspects say of his 
visual system,

385
00:23:35,311 --> 00:23:36,144
has auditory system learns to parse up 
the world by generating machinery that 

386
00:23:40,231 --> 00:23:43,980
allows the complex patterns that make up
the world to be turned into objects.

387
00:23:43,981 --> 00:23:44,814
So there's the thing,
the structure that allows the 

388
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:47,594
perceiving,
and then there's the thing that's being 

389
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:54,641
perceived or the thing behind that.
This is a very complicated distinction.

390
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:55,671
You'd say,
well,

391
00:23:55,671 --> 00:23:58,700
what's the difference between the dragon
of chaos?

392
00:23:58,701 --> 00:23:59,534
Say either the representation of the 
cosmos as such and the great mother and 

393
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:07,790
I would say it's something like this.

394
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,633
The unknown that appears in relationship
to a perceiver is different than the 

395
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,840
unknown as such,
so I would say this,

396
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:18,674
for example,
there are going to be things that 

397
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:23,810
surprise you that wouldn't surprise me 
and vice versa,

398
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,913
and the things that would surprise you 
have to be construed in relationship to 

399
00:24:28,131 --> 00:24:28,964
what you to what you already know,
because you're only going to be 

400
00:24:31,791 --> 00:24:34,970
surprised by things you don't know and 
likewise for me,

401
00:24:34,971 --> 00:24:37,160
I'm only going to be surprised by things
I don't know,

402
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,500
but what we know is going to vary 
somewhat.

403
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,543
So the unknown for you is going to be 
different than the unknown for me and 

404
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:45,554
the great mother is a representation of 
the unknown for you or the unknown for 

405
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:52,820
me.
Different for everyone in some sense,

406
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:54,140
because we're all going to

407
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,283
B,

408
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,383
we're all.
We're all going to be stymied and 

409
00:24:58,591 --> 00:25:02,160
stopped by different aspects of being,
but the same as well.

410
00:25:02,161 --> 00:25:02,994
In that when you encounter things you 
don't understand and you encounter 

411
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:09,300
things you don't understand in many,
many ways,

412
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:12,360
you're going to react to those different
things the same way,

413
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,373
and I can give you a narrative 
illustration of this King Arthur's 

414
00:25:16,951 --> 00:25:19,410
nights,
they sit around the round table.

415
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,393
They're all equal,
so that's why they sit around a round 

416
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:22,434
table,
right?

417
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,380
They have a king.
The king determines their destinies like

418
00:25:25,381 --> 00:25:26,970
Marta does,
but they're still all equal.

419
00:25:26,971 --> 00:25:29,340
They determined they're going to go look
for the holy grail.

420
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,150
This is the symbol of redemption,
so they're off to find the highest value

421
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,360
like Pinocchio,
wishing on a star,

422
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,283
highest value,
and they all enter the forest to begin 

423
00:25:39,691 --> 00:25:40,524
the quest,
but they each entered at the place that 

424
00:25:41,611 --> 00:25:44,670
appears dark as to each of the rights.
That means they all go on different.

425
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,773
They all go in different directions even
though they're on the same quest and 

426
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,180
theoretically they're inhabiting the 
same space,

427
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,553
so.

428
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,810
So it's only to say that every person 
has their demons,

429
00:25:56,811 --> 00:25:59,570
so to speak,
and that those demons differ from person

430
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:02,240
to person.
Even though there are things you can say

431
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:04,820
about the demons that are common across 
people,

432
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:05,930
so we know,
for example,

433
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:06,764
from clinical work,
from endless clinical work that if you 

434
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:11,000
want to help someone,
you identify,

435
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:12,590
okay,
what do you want to do?

436
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,880
They need to know that,
right?

437
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:15,440
That's this.
What do you want to do?

438
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:16,274
Where do you want to go?
What kind of structure do you want to 

439
00:26:17,961 --> 00:26:20,120
impose on your world?
And then you identify,

440
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:22,370
okay,
well what things are stopping you.

441
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,300
So then you look back at the Sumerian 
creation myth and you think,

442
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,840
well,
there's Appsu,

443
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,680
right?
God of the known timeouts consort,

444
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:31,940
right?
Culture,

445
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,240
but there's also Marta.
Marta is the power of the spirit,

446
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:40,241
the entity representation of the 
Sumerian savior who goes out to confront

447
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,120
this and to make the world and well,
that's what you teach people in behavior

448
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:47,364
therapy.
You teach them not so much that you 

449
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:51,084
don't teach them habituation.
You don't teach them to get used to 

450
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:54,054
things that they're afraid of.
You teach them that there's something 

451
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:58,200
within them that can respond to the 
things that they're afraid of.

452
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,100
That's as great a magnitude as the fears
themselves.

453
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,190
No.
