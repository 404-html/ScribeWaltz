1
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,160
So I want to tell you about a book 
today.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,770
The book is called the Gulag 
Archipelago.

3
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:23,980
We ready.
The book is called the Gulag Archipelago

4
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,053
and it's by a Russian author,
Soviet author named Alexandra Soldier 

5
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:30,663
Nixon,
who was in the Gulag archipelago 

6
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,810
concentration camp system for a very 
long time.

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,700
He had a very hard life.
He was on the

8
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,603
Russian front when the Germans invaded 
Soviet Union in the early stages of 

9
00:00:51,011 --> 00:00:51,844
World War II.
Now Hitler and Stalin had signed a 

10
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,020
nonaggression pact.
Um,

11
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,260
and Hitler invaded the Soviet Union 
anyway.

12
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,540
And from what I've been able to 
understand,

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,340
the Soviets had prepared an invasion 
force for Europe at that point,

14
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:14,850
but we're not concerned with having to 
defend their territory.

15
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:17,970
And so they were caught completely 
unawares by Hitler's move.

16
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,500
And the conditions on the Russian front 
were absolutely dreadful.

17
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,190
And Soldier Nixon was a soldier on the 
Russian front,

18
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,743
and

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,270
he wrote some letters to one of his 
friends,

20
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,063
which were intercepted,
complaining about the lack of 

21
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:38,274
preparation and,
and using bitter dark humor to describe 

22
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:44,370
the situation.
And

23
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,710
the consequences of that was that he was
thrown into a work camp.

24
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,113
The Soviet system relied on work camps.
And so those were large labor camps of 

25
00:01:56,581 --> 00:02:00,510
people who were essentially enslaved,
many of whom were worked to death,

26
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:01,344
often froze to death,
working in conditions that were so 

27
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:06,150
dreadful that they're virtually 
unimaginable.

28
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,490
Solzhenitsyn spent a very large number 
of years in these camps,

29
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,533
uh,
sometimes in a more privileged camp 

30
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:17,370
because he was an educated man and 
sometimes in worst camps.

31
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,710
He also,
uh,

32
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,570
developed cancer,
uh,

33
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,680
later and wrote a book about that called
Cancer Ward,

34
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,130
which is a brilliant book.
Um,

35
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,430
so he had a very hard life.
There's just no way around that to be on

36
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:36,264
the front and then to be in a 
concentration camp and then to have 

37
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,350
cancer.
That's,

38
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,590
that's pretty rough.
Now he wrote the Gulag archipelago.

39
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,083
He wrote a book called one day in the 
life of Ivan Denisovich first that was 

40
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:53,210
published in the early 1960s when there 
was a brief thought.

41
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,940
Stalin was pretty much out of the 
picture.

42
00:02:55,941 --> 00:02:56,774
By the end of the 1950s.
There's some indication that he was 

43
00:02:58,551 --> 00:03:00,010
murdered by

44
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,143
Khrushchev.
Ana Khrushchev became premier of the 

45
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,930
Soviet Union afters stolen and there's 
some indication perhaps that stellan was

46
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:11,764
either murdered by Khrushchev and a set 
of his cronies or when he was very ill 

47
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,310
just before he died,
was not helped at least by,

48
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,000
wasn't provided with any medical 
attention because of the intervention of

49
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:25,834
cruise and his cronies.
Now there's some indication as well at 

50
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:29,284
that point that Stalin who was an 
absolute absolutely barbaric in every 

51
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:33,934
possible way you could imagine was 
planning to start a third World War and 

52
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:43,810
he was certainly capable of doing such 
things because he had already imprisoned

53
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:48,811
or killed tens of millions of people.
Now just after Stalin died,

54
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:51,904
there was a bit of a thought in the 
Soviet Union with regards to internal 

55
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:54,814
repression.
In the early 1960s Solzhenitsyn 

56
00:03:57,191 --> 00:04:00,130
published a book called one day in the 
life of Ivan Denisovich,

57
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,590
which was a story about one day in the 
life,

58
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,570
his life really inside one of these so 
called Gulag archipelago camps.

59
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,403
Now,
he called it the Gulag archipelago 

60
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:11,740
because an archipelago is a chain of 
islands.

61
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,900
And so soldier knits enlightened the 
work camp system in the Soviet Union,

62
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:20,920
which was made up of isolated camps 
distributed across the entire state.

63
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,100
He likened that to a series of islands 
and enhance,

64
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:24,963
hence the metaphor.
And one day in the life of Ivan 

65
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,413
Denisovich was one of the first 
publications released in the Soviet 

66
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,850
Union that dared make public what had 
happened inside these camps,

67
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:39,640
at least initially.
Now that thought didn't last very long,

68
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:42,820
but that book had a tremendous effect.
It's a short book.

69
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,560
It's worth reading.
Um,

70
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,310
after that he spent,
he wrote a number of other books,

71
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:51,430
which are also great.
He's a great literary figure in the same

72
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:53,680
category,
I would say as tolstoy or Dostoevsky,

73
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,900
which is like really saying something,
you know,

74
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:56,734
those,
those two are perhaps the greatest 

75
00:04:57,761 --> 00:05:01,300
literary figures who ever lived with the
possible exception of Shakespeare.

76
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,473
Um,
he wrote this book called the Gulag 

77
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,210
Archipelago,
which is published in three volumes,

78
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:10,450
each of which has about 700 pages long.
Um,

79
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,130
the first one details the origin of the 
oppressive Soviet system,

80
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,353
at least in part under Lenin.
And then it's full fledged 

81
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:22,590
implementation under Stalin and the 
deaths of while Sojun.

82
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:23,424
It's an estimated the deaths in,
in internal repression in the Soviet 

83
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,060
Union at something approximating 60 
million between 1919 in 1959.

84
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,260
Now that doesn't count the death toll in
the second world war by the way.

85
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,840
Now people have disputed those figures 
at,

86
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:38,674
but there are certainly in the tens of 
millions and the low end bounds are 

87
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,154
probably 20 million and the high end 
bounds or nearer what sole sole 

88
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,053
Jeanette's an estimated.
He also estimated that the same kind of 

89
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:52,210
internal repression in Maoist China cost
100 million lives.

90
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:55,990
And so you can imagine that the genuine 
historical figures,

91
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,363
again are to dispute,
but somewhere between 50 and a hundred 

92
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:00,650
million people.

93
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,483
And one of the things that's really 
surprising to me and that that I think 

94
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:07,730
is absolutely reprehensible,
absolutely reprehensible,

95
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,200
is the fact that this is not widespread 
knowledge among students in the West.

96
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:14,300
Any of this.
And it's because your education,

97
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,433
your historical education,
if you started to describe it as 

98
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:19,850
appalling,
you would barely scratched the surface.

99
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:20,684
These were the most important events of 
the 20th century and they're barely 

100
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:26,780
covered at all in standard historical 
curriculum.

101
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,853
You know,
something I would presume about World 

102
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,663
War II and about the terrible situation 
and Nazi Germany and the death of 6 

103
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,323
million Gypsies and Jews and homosexuals
in the concentration camps in Nazi 

104
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,110
Germany.
But my experience with students has been

105
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:42,944
that none of them know anything about 
what happened as a consequence of the 

106
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:48,590
repression of the radical left in the 
20th century.

107
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:49,424
And I believe the reason for that is 
that the communist system had extensive 

108
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:59,450
networks of admirers in the west,
especially among intellectuals and still

109
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:02,030
in fact does,
which is also equally reprehensible.

110
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,930
Um,
and I believe the,

111
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:04,893
that one of the consequences of that is 
that this element of history has been 

112
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,830
under,
uh,

113
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,743
under,
what would you say under examined and 

114
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,703
certainly very little attention has been
brought to it in a public school 

115
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:19,274
curricula.
And there's absolutely no excuse for 

116
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:21,854
that.
It was the worst thing that happened in 

117
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:23,864
the 20th century.
And that's really saying something 

118
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,710
because the 20th century was about as 
bad as it gets.

119
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,440
And so,
and the fact that these,

120
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:31,274
these massive,
these deaths on massive scale occurred 

121
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,560
and the fact that we don't know that 
deep inside our bones is,

122
00:07:37,561 --> 00:07:38,394
is,
is a testament to the absolute rot of 

123
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:44,210
the education system.
So now you might think this is a strange

124
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:46,730
thing to discuss in a personality 
course,

125
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,920
but I,
I have my reasons for doing it.

126
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:49,754
That the fundamental reason is that 
Solzhenitsyn you might regard as an 

127
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:54,020
existentialist.

128
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,860
Now he says many of this things,
same things that Viktor Frankl says.

129
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,590
Viktor Frankl wrote a book called Man's 
search for meaning,

130
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,220
which I would highly recommend.
Um,

131
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,273
and it's a description of,
of the corruption that he saw leading 

132
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:10,310
into the horrors of the Nazi 
concentration camp systems,

133
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:12,590
especially within the concentration 
camps itself.

134
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:13,424
Because Frankl was very interested in 
what sort of psychological catastrophe 

135
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,823
had to be fall a given individual before
that person was capable of acting as an 

136
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:24,404
agent,
say of the Nazis in the concentration 

137
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:26,744
camp system.
And he concentrated particularly on 

138
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:29,983
these people he called that were known 
as trustees within the concentration 

139
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:34,724
camp system,
who were generally Jewish individuals 

140
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:40,730
who are aiding the Nazis in their death 
work inside the camps.

141
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,290
Now,
what Frankl did,

142
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,290
because he was also existentially 
oriented,

143
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,124
was attempt to draw a parallel between 
the individual psychology and the mass 

144
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:51,890
pathologies of the state.

145
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,610
And so the reason that I believe that 
this is important in a personality class

146
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:57,444
is because it's necessary to analyze the
relationship between the psychological 

147
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:03,414
integrity of the individuals with is it 
within a society and the propensity of 

148
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:08,304
that society to engage in say,
acts of mass atrocity or to go to go 

149
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:16,020
completely off the rails and then to 
engage in acts of mass atrocity.

150
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,000
And so it was Frankel's contention and 
also soldier Knutson's contention.

151
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:21,834
And I would say also the contention of 
Vaclav Havel who eventually who was an 

152
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,410
author and playwright in Czechoslovakia 
and eventually became president,

153
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,100
that the fundamental linkage between the
pathology and the state,

154
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,653
the pathology of the state and the 
individual was the individual's 

155
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:40,040
propensity to deceive him or herself and
to,

156
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,430
so to,
to fail.

157
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:42,264
To Act in an authentic manner,
in a genuine and authentic matter 

158
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,313
manner,
and to become as a consequence either 

159
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,470
nihilistic,
let's say,

160
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,633
or because because of the incremental 
weakening of character that's part and 

161
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:55,854
parcel of,
of adopting an inauthentic motive being 

162
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:04,590
or to turn to ideological and 
totalitarian solutions as an alternative

163
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:09,180
to living appropriately and with 
responsibility as an individual.

164
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,180
So soldier Nixon in particular laid at 
the feet of the Soviet citizenry,

165
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:20,450
the burden of the absolute catastrophes 
that characterize that system because of

166
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:21,834
their,
because of the each individual's 

167
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,733
propensity or proclivity within the 
state to lie and deceive constantly 

168
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:31,170
about what they thought and what they 
said.

169
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,273
And to be afraid to speak and to be 
afraid to think and to be afraid to 

170
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:35,934
criticize.
And it was no wonder because criticism 

171
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,320
of course was at least at at least 
became an offense that was punishable by

172
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:44,154
death.
But these things start much more slowly 

173
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,423
than that.
And they start with people abandoning 

174
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:49,884
their,
their own identities and adopting a 

175
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:55,620
pathological group identity.
Well for it,

176
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,454
for any number of reasons.
But one of them certainly is their 

177
00:10:58,711 --> 00:10:59,544
desire to shrink for from individual 
responsibility and their desire for 

178
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,970
ready made ideological solutions.
And so I'm going,

179
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,850
what I'm going to do today is I'm going 
to read you a little bit about the Gulag

180
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:09,684
archipelago and then I'm going to do 
show you a sequence of videos about a 

181
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:14,394
recent event that I think does a very 
good job of illustrating how this sort 

182
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:17,844
of thing works.

183
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,090
And then I'm going to read you some of 
the,

184
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,313
some of what I've code from the Gulag 
archipelago so that you get a sense of 

185
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,750
what the writing is like.
So soldier knits and basically he,

186
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,770
he committed a huge part of the Gulag 
archipelago to memory,

187
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,450
which is really something given that 
it's 2100 pages long and printed in like

188
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:37,284
seven point font and the book is written
at an unbelievable level of emotional 

189
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:42,540
intensity.
It's,

190
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,763
it's,
I remember there was a study once about 

191
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,450
how rats respond to cats free living 
routes in,

192
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:50,284
in their burrows.
If they're exposed to a cat or even to 

193
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,124
cat odor will run back to their burrow 
and stick their nose out and scream for 

194
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:00,580
48 hours.
Right.

195
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:01,414
Which is about the equivalent of you 
screaming for three months because rats 

196
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:06,340
don't,
when we live about two years and well,

197
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:07,390
that rat is screaming.

198
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,860
All the other rats stay in their burrow 
and don't go anywhere and so they scream

199
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:12,694
ultrasonically so you have to record it 
and then slow it down in order to hear 

200
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:16,384
it.
But they're not very happy about that 

201
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,860
about cats and they actually don't need 
to be exposed to cats to learn how to be

202
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:26,170
afraid of their older.
They're naturally afraid of it.

203
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,450
Anyways.
Solzhenitsyn's book,

204
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,780
the Gulag Archipelago is like a 2100 
page screen.

205
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,910
It's very,
very intense.

206
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:37,420
It's a very difficult thing to read,
but it's absolutely crucial reading.

207
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:41,050
It's actually now part of the curriculum
in Russia in high school,

208
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,183
which also says something about Russian 
high school as compared to say North 

209
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,993
American high schools.
Because I doubt if the typical North 

210
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,813
American high school student reads 2100 
pages of anything during their entire 

211
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,683
education in high school and certainly 
not something like the Gulag 

212
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:57,370
archipelago.
So I'm going to read you a little bit of

213
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:58,510
background about the story.

214
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,000
First of all,
and this is a nice summary.

215
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,970
Um,
I've swiped it from Wikipedia,

216
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,530
but the Gulag archipelago is a book by 
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.

217
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,510
He won a Nobel prize for that,
for the book,

218
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:11,344
by the way,
and richly deserved at about the Soviet 

219
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:13,684
forced labor camp system.
The three volume book is a narrative 

220
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,210
relying on eyewitness testimony and 
primary research material as well as the

221
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:27,211
author's own experiences in a gulag 
labor camp written between 1958 and 1968

222
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:33,870
it was published in the West in 1973
and thereafter circulated in Samizdat or

223
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:39,880
underground publication form in the 
Soviet Union until its appearance in the

224
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:44,110
Russian literary journal.
Novy Mir in 1989 in which a third of the

225
00:13:44,111 --> 00:13:48,910
work was published over three issues.
So the Samizdat or the underground press

226
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,880
was basically photocopies or,
or,

227
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:51,714
or sometimes photos,
stats of band works that people would 

228
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:57,970
compile and then hand from person to 
person.

229
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,113
Um,
of course the punishment for being 

230
00:14:00,221 --> 00:14:03,220
caught with something like that was,
was extraordinarily severe,

231
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:04,054
but the Samizdat was a,
I suppose it was the precursor to the 

232
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:08,530
Internet.
That's one way of thinking about it.

233
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:11,180
A slow precursor to the Internet.
Um,

234
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,693
ghoulag or gee,
you lag or ghoulag is an acronym for 

235
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:16,660
the,
for a Russian term,

236
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,800
um,
chief administration of corrective labor

237
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:21,634
camps,
the bureaucratic name of the governing 

238
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:26,490
board of the Soviet labor camp system.
And by Mytonomy,

239
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,500
that camp system itself,
the word archipelago compares the system

240
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:36,631
of labor camps spread across the Soviet 
Union with a vast chain of islands known

241
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,010
only to those who were fated to visit 
them.

242
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,163
Since the dissolution of the Soviet 
Union and the formation of the Russian 

243
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,973
Federation,
the Gulag Archipelago has been 

244
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:46,504
officially published and included in the
high school program in Russia as 

245
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:51,340
mandatory reading.
Structurally,

246
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,663
the terrace comprises seven sections 
divided in most printed volumes into 

247
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,070
three parts,
one to two,

248
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:01,100
three and four and five to seven at one 
level,

249
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,930
the Gulag archipelago traces the history
of the system of forced labor camps that

250
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:06,764
existed in the Soviet Union from 1918 to
1956 starting with Lenin's original 

251
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:14,990
decrees shortly after the October 
Revolution,

252
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,123
establishing the legal and practical 
framework for a series of camps where 

253
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:19,904
political prisoners and ordinary 
criminals would be sentenced to forced 

254
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,330
labor.

255
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,090
One of the things that's quite 
interesting about the gulag camps,

256
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:26,924
and this is something that's very 
relevant to understanding of modern 

257
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:29,924
Russia,
is that so ordinary criminals were put 

258
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:32,834
into the camps.
And so we're political prisoner 

259
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,750
prisoners,
but the ordinary criminals.

260
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:37,610
And so those would be rapists and 
murderers,

261
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:38,444
let's say,
as well as thieves who were engaged in 

262
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,653
theft as an occupation.
Those were regarded by the Soviets as 

263
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:45,464
socially friendly elements.
And the reason for that was that they 

264
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:49,334
assumed that the reason that these 
people had turned to crime was because 

265
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:52,514
the pr of the oppressive nature of the 
previous czarist slash capitalist 

266
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:57,434
system.
And that the only reason that these 

267
00:15:58,701 --> 00:16:01,220
criminals existed was because they had 
been oppressed.

268
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,100
They were oppressed victims of that 
system.

269
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:04,934
And so one of the convenient 
consequences of that absolutely insane 

270
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:09,284
doctrine was that the Soviets put the 
ordinary criminals in charge of the 

271
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:13,454
camps.

272
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,580
And these were very,
very seriously bad people.

273
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:20,180
And so you can imagine the way that they
treated the political prisoners who were

274
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,470
regarded as socially hostile elements,
sometimes because of their own,

275
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,393
hypothetically traitorous acts,
but more often merely as a consequence 

276
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,473
of their racial or ethnic identity,
or the fact that they were related by 

277
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:37,130
birth to say people who had been 
successful under the previous system.

278
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:37,964
So who had any,
any association with nobility or any 

279
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:41,114
association with what were known as the 
Kulaks who were the only successful 

280
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,374
class of former peasants in the Soviet 
Union because they were regarded as 

281
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,173
privileged.
You may have heard that word more 

282
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:52,484
recently.
They were regarded as privileged and 

283
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:55,184
therefore as enemies of the state.
And it didn't matter if it was your 

284
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:58,064
father or your grandfather or your great
grandfather who happened to be 

285
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:03,290
privileged,
but the mere fact that you were a member

286
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,920
of that group was sufficient reason to 
put you into a camp.

287
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,143
And we're talking hundreds of thousands 
or perhaps millions of people who 

288
00:17:10,581 --> 00:17:13,640
underwent that fate.
And so the idea and the Soviet Union was

289
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,220
just because you are the member of a 
class.

290
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:19,220
Even as a consequence of your familial 
association,

291
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,660
you were immediately sufficiently guilty
to be put into a camp and punished.

292
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:24,494
And the,
and the terms for the camps were often 

293
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:28,010
10 years,
15 years long.

294
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:31,220
And if you were very fortunate,
you got to have two or three of those.

295
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,160
So the,
the Soviets really implemented and,

296
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,023
and perfected the idea of class and if 
this city based guilt and it's a very 

297
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,194
bad road to walk down and it's something
that we're very much engaged in at the 

298
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:46,214
moment because there's discussion 
everywhere in North America now about 

299
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:52,770
the idea of while race predicated guilt 
for example,

300
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:53,843
and ethnic predicated guilt.
And it's a very bad idea to classify an 

301
00:17:57,871 --> 00:17:58,704
entire group of people as guilty of 
anything based on their group 

302
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:01,674
membership.

303
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:02,963
So these,
these sorts of things are things we 

304
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:06,360
haven't yet learned and certainly should
have.

305
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:08,963
Now.
The other thing that was very 

306
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:12,900
interesting about the Soviet,
especially about the Gulag archipelago.

307
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:13,783
See,
it was released in the West in about 

308
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,624
1973 or thereabouts now.
The student movement of the 1960s was 

309
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:23,610
very much influenced by Marxist and 
communist doctrine.

310
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,623
And that was especially the case in 
France where the most reprehensible 

311
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:30,000
intellectuals of the 20th century have 
emerged,

312
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:30,834
emerged,
including all the damned postmodernists 

313
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,710
who've occupied the universities.
Now,

314
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:35,544
as far as I can tell,
and what happened essentially in France 

315
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:38,634
was that the Marxist slash communist 
students were attempting to foment 

316
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:43,920
revolution.
But what happened,

317
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:47,970
and that peaked in about 1968 and what 
happened was,

318
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,360
at least in part as a consequence of 
social knutson's revelations,

319
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,510
the idea that the Soviet model or the 
mouse model,

320
00:18:54,511 --> 00:18:56,790
for example,
could be used as a,

321
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:57,923
uh,
an example of the working people's 

322
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:04,420
Utopia was completely and catastrophic 
Lee,

323
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,710
and at least in principle,
finally undermined.

324
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,150
Now there had been received because of 
the western leftist intellectuals.

325
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:12,984
All right,
from 1919 forward turned a blind eye to 

326
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:18,540
what was happening in the Soviet Union 
now.

327
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,790
And then they were invited there.
Even people,

328
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,080
well people who are,
who are very real,

329
00:19:23,081 --> 00:19:23,914
well regarded in the west were often 
invited and who were sympathetic to the 

330
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,180
Soviet Union were often invited there 
for a visit and the Soviets would do the

331
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:33,150
same thing in the North Koreans do now 
when they invite foreigners to visit,

332
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:33,984
which,
which is that they would set up fake 

333
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:40,881
places for them to visit called Potemkin
villages where everyone was thriving and

334
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:42,354
doing well.
That Nazis did the same thing with the 

335
00:19:43,621 --> 00:19:46,530
concentration camps to begin with,
especially the ones they established for

336
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:47,400
children.
And they had,

337
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:48,234
would invite dimwitted leftist Western 
intellectuals to come to the Soviet 

338
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,000
Union and see the wonderful paradise 
that had been set up for everyone,

339
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,840
which was a complete and your facade and
sham.

340
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:58,883
And then they would go back to the West 
and report on how the utopia was 

341
00:20:01,111 --> 00:20:04,230
progressing precisely according to the 
Marxist doctorates.

342
00:20:04,231 --> 00:20:05,064
And we knew from the 1930s forward,
cause Malcolm muggeridge did this to 

343
00:20:08,491 --> 00:20:11,430
begin with who investigated what was 
going on in the Soviet Union,

344
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,810
I think for the Manchester Guardian.
And he started reporting in 19 in the,

345
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:20,950
in the late 19 tans and then the early 
1920s if I remember correctly,

346
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:23,400
it was approximately in that period,
maybe a bit later,

347
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:24,893
he recorded what was happening when the 
Soviets attempted to collect 

348
00:20:27,281 --> 00:20:29,370
collectivize,
the peasant farmers.

349
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,230
And so what they did was take all these 
people who were previously pet surfs,

350
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:35,970
right?
Only a couple of decades previously,

351
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:37,980
which was not much better than being a 
slave.

352
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,993
You're basically property and that was 
happening until about 1880 or 

353
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:43,920
thereabouts.
The serfs were emancipated.

354
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,230
Many of them ended up holding their own 
land.

355
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:46,470
Right.

356
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,240
So the land was from the nobles to the 
peasantry.

357
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:53,380
That was something that tolstoy was,
Leo tolstoy was involved in,

358
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,830
and by the time the Soviet revolution 
came around,

359
00:20:56,831 --> 00:21:01,831
which would be at the latter part of the
19 teens after the first world war,

360
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,310
the peasant class had actually 
established farms,

361
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:08,080
of course,
varying productivity.

362
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:08,914
Some of the peasant farmers were very,
very good at being farmers and produced 

363
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:16,060
a huge proportion of Russia's and the 
Ukraine's food.

364
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,360
Because one of the things,
we'll talk about this later as the class

365
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,420
progressed is one of the things that 
you'll find if the,

366
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,670
if you look at creative production in 
any domain,

367
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:26,770
it doesn't matter.
Artistic Domain,

368
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,710
food production,
novels,

369
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:31,330
written novels,
sold,

370
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,850
money generated,
number of companies generated,

371
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,700
number of goals,
scored in hockey,

372
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,820
et cetera.
Any number of paintings,

373
00:21:39,821 --> 00:21:41,800
painted,
number of compositions written,

374
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:42,634
anything like that.
Where where the fundamental underlying 

375
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:47,350
measure is human productivity.

376
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,183
What you find is that a very tiny 
percentage of people produce almost all 

377
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,010
the output.
It's called a pareto distribution,

378
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:54,441
p,
a,

379
00:21:54,441 --> 00:21:54,891
r,
e,

380
00:21:54,891 --> 00:21:55,724
t,
O,

381
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,410
and it was studied in detail in 
scientific productivity by someone named

382
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,910
Desal,
a price.

383
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,260
It's a square root law.
So here's the law.

384
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,173
Fundamentally,
if you look at the number of people who 

385
00:22:06,251 --> 00:22:07,540
are doing,
who are,

386
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,990
who are in a given domain,
who are producing in a given domain,

387
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:14,680
the square root of the people produce 
half the product.

388
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,490
So that means if you have 10 employees,
three of them do half the work,

389
00:22:18,491 --> 00:22:22,450
but if you have 10,000 employees,
a hundred of them do half the work,

390
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:23,950
right?
It's a very,

391
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:24,784
very vicious statistic and you won't 
learn about that in psychology for 

392
00:22:27,551 --> 00:22:28,384
reasons I have no idea about,
because you learn about the normal 

393
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,650
distribution and not the prieto 
distribution,

394
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:35,350
but pareto distributions govern,
for example,

395
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:36,184
the distribution of money,
which is why 1% of the people in the 

396
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:40,474
general population have the overwhelming
amount of money and one 10th of that 1% 

397
00:22:44,591 --> 00:22:46,570
has almost all of that,
right?

398
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,403
So I think it's like the richest hundred
people in the world have as much money 

399
00:22:51,131 --> 00:22:53,680
as the bottom two and a half billion.
And you think,

400
00:22:53,681 --> 00:22:55,870
well that's a terrible thing.
And perhaps it is.

401
00:22:55,871 --> 00:22:56,704
But what you have to understand is that 
that law governs the distribution of 

402
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:02,950
creative production across all creative 
domains,

403
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,290
right?
It's something like a natural law.

404
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,760
And we can,
we'll talk about that more,

405
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:09,100
but imagine what happens when you play 
monopoly.

406
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,130
You've all played monopoly.
What happens when you play monopoly?

407
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,950
One person ends up with all the money,
right?

408
00:23:14,951 --> 00:23:17,470
Then you play another game of monopoly.
What happens?

409
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,000
One person ends up with all the money.
It's actually the inevitable consequence

410
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:24,970
of multiple trades that are conducted 
randomly.

411
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:28,240
So if you take a thousand people and you
get them to play a trading game,

412
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,253
you get each give them $100 say or $10 
and they have to trade with another 

413
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:36,850
person by flipping a coin I,
when the coin toss you give me a dollar,

414
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:38,080
you win,
I give you a dollar.

415
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,063
If we all play that long enough,
one person will end up with all the 

416
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,660
money and everyone else will end up with
zero.

417
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,003
So it's a deeply built feature of 
systems of creative production and no 

418
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:50,474
one really knows what to do about it 
because of course the danger is is that 

419
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:57,410
all the resources get funneled to a tiny
minority of people at the top and a huge

420
00:23:57,411 --> 00:23:59,930
section of the population stacks up at 
zero.

421
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:05,470
But to blame that on the oppressive 
nature of a given system is to radically

422
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:07,970
underestimate the complexity of the 
problem.

423
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,013
No one actually knows how to effectively
shovel resources from the minority that 

424
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,210
that controls almost everything to the 
majority.

425
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:20,240
That has almost nothing in any 
consistent way.

426
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:21,074
Because as you shovel money down,
it tends to move right back up and it's 

427
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:25,670
a big problem.
Anyways,

428
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:29,600
the reason I'm telling you about that is
because after the peasants were,

429
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:32,120
were granted their land and started to 
become farmers,

430
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:35,240
a tiny minority of them became extremely
successful.

431
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,550
And those people produced almost all of 
the food for Russia and Ukraine.

432
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,423
So what happened in the 1920s when 
bloody lennon came along and 

433
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:44,204
collectivize the farms,
was that they defined the Kulaks who 

434
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,084
were these tiny minority of successful 
farmers who maybe had a brick house and 

435
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:51,254
were able to hire a couple of people and
had some land and some livestock and 

436
00:24:54,651 --> 00:24:58,910
were very productive people.
They defined them as socially unfriendly

437
00:24:58,911 --> 00:24:59,744
elements and they sent groups of 
intellectuals out into the towns to 

438
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:05,810
collectivize the farms.
And so the idea was that while you would

439
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:06,644
pool your land and,
and everyone would farm it collectively 

440
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,940
and the land was taken away of course 
from the tiny minority of people who are

441
00:25:13,941 --> 00:25:17,180
actually productive and had actually 
managed to own much of the land.

442
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:19,430
So you have to imagine how that would 
occur.

443
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,623
Okay.
So it's in the 1920s it's after the 

444
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:25,670
world after World War One rushes in 
pretty bad shape.

445
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:26,503
The villages are full of brutalized men 
who have post traumatic stress disorder 

446
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,720
and lots of people who are not doing 
well at all.

447
00:25:32,721 --> 00:25:35,090
And the bloody intellectuals come into 
the town and they say,

448
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,103
you know,
those successful farmers up the street 

449
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,623
that you've always been pretty jealous 
about in your useless manner while 

450
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:45,500
they're actually pigs and demons who are
stealing from you.

451
00:25:45,501 --> 00:25:46,334
So why don't you come out,
we'll form a nice little mob and we'll 

452
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:51,290
take everything they've got.
And that's exactly what happened.

453
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:52,124
And all those people were killed or 
raped or set off to Siberia in the 

454
00:25:54,981 --> 00:25:57,850
middle of the bloody winter where there 
wasn't even anything for them to,

455
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,830
to anywhere for them to live or anything
for them to eat.

456
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,783
So they all died.
And then the consequence of that was a 

457
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,310
few years later,
6 million people starved to death in the

458
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:08,144
Ukraine.
And Malcolm Muggeridge had been 

459
00:26:09,471 --> 00:26:13,130
reporting on that since the 1930s and so
that was the,

460
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,443
that was the first wind really,
that the west God of exactly what was 

461
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:18,440
happening in the Soviet Union.

462
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,513
But even at that point,
that bloody left wing intellectuals in 

463
00:26:21,651 --> 00:26:22,484
North America,
we're so damn clueless and in Europe 

464
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,020
that they never paid much attention to 
it with,

465
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,860
with the exception of certain number of 
people like George Orwell who wrote 1984

466
00:26:30,861 --> 00:26:31,970
and,
and a,

467
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:35,120
and a animal farm,
which is of course a discussion.

468
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,510
The main pig in animal farm is stallon 
of course.

469
00:26:38,511 --> 00:26:39,344
And it's a story,
an allegory about the Russian 

470
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:44,670
revolution,
whose basic motif is,

471
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,653
we're all equal.
But of course some all animals are 

472
00:26:47,761 --> 00:26:50,130
equal,
but some are more equal than others.

473
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,300
And that's the motif.
That's the Motif of animal farms.

474
00:26:53,301 --> 00:26:55,380
So there had been warnings all the way 
through,

475
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:56,214
right from the beginning of the Russian 
revolution to the West about exactly 

476
00:26:58,861 --> 00:26:59,694
what was going on.
But because communists and Marxists 

477
00:27:02,171 --> 00:27:03,004
videology is very good at Adlink,
the the week binds of idiot 

478
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:06,954
intellectuals,
there was a huge section of the 

479
00:27:08,521 --> 00:27:11,130
population who was fomenting,
I suppose,

480
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,590
against the standard,
what would you call it?

481
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,150
Political,
psychological,

482
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:17,120
and social order,
who were,

483
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,073
we're absolutely committed to the ethic 
that's encased in statements like from 

484
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:25,110
each according to his ability to each 
according to his need,

485
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,860
which sounds perfectly wonderful if you 
think about it for about 15 seconds.

486
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:29,694
But if you think about it for six months
becomes unbelievably murderous and it's 

487
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,610
reaching and,
and the intent.

488
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,010
And so anyways,
the French,

489
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:38,844
for whatever reason,
seem to be particularly opaque to 

490
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,540
reason.
I'll give you an example.

491
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:43,374
So the doctrine of Pol Pot in Cambodia 
that also killed about 6 million people 

492
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,423
hit.
So what they did in Cambodia once the 

493
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:52,134
revolution occurred was decided that 
everyone in the city were parasites on 

494
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:56,124
the countryside because the countryside 
full of farmers was where the primary 

495
00:27:58,531 --> 00:27:59,364
production was taking place and they 
regarded the city dwellers as parasites 

496
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:06,060
on that fundamental production.
So they basically emptied out the cities

497
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:06,894
and up sent all the people in the cities
out to work in the country as forced 

498
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:10,740
labor.

499
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,573
And 6 million people died there.
And the chief architect of that bloody 

500
00:28:14,701 --> 00:28:19,290
project got his phd from the Sorbonne 
and said exactly what he was going to do

501
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:20,124
when he went back to Cambodia,
was cheered along by the French 

502
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:24,870
intellectuals who thought that that was 
just a fine idea.

503
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,273
So that's all background for why I don't
think any of you guys really know much 

504
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:31,800
about 20th century history.
So anyways,

505
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:32,634
what happened in the 1970s when when 
Solzhenitsyn published the Gulag 

506
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:40,230
archipelago was that it was so 
brilliant,

507
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,093
the book and so overwhelming and it's 
emotional and intellectual and 

508
00:28:45,241 --> 00:28:46,074
historical power that it became 
impossible for anyone to continue to 

509
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:52,284
claim that Marxism slash communism had 
any intellectual or ethical integrity 

510
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,610
whatsoever.
It was done,

511
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,950
it was done.
And that's part of the reason why he won

512
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,340
the Nobel Prize.
And part of the reason,

513
00:29:05,341 --> 00:29:07,470
by the way,
why the Soviet Union collapsed,

514
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,820
because once word got out about exactly 
what was actually going on,

515
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,360
there was no way of making a coherent 
argument in favor of say,

516
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:17,940
exporting the Worker's revolution around
the world.

517
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:18,803
It's like the consequence of that was 
well documented by Solzhenitsyn and see 

518
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:23,434
it in the western intellectuals tried to
make excuses for what had happened in 

519
00:29:27,361 --> 00:29:28,194
the Soviet Union by blaming it on 
Stalins cultive personality perversion 

520
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,530
of the original accurate Marxist 
doctrines.

521
00:29:36,531 --> 00:29:37,860
So they basically said,
well,

522
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,370
Lennon had Lenin lived cause he died 
quite young and was replaced by Stellan.

523
00:29:42,371 --> 00:29:43,204
Had Lenin lived,
the promised utopia would have been 

524
00:29:45,461 --> 00:29:46,294
delivered.
But Solzhenitsyn being an absolute 

525
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:48,634
genius documented the relationship 
number one b between the axioms of 

526
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:54,754
Marxist and communist thought.
And the laws that were generated 

527
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,353
primarily by Lenin and the,
and the construction of these camps and 

528
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:04,000
the d Kulak ization and all the mass 
murders.

529
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:04,834
He documented the causal relationship 
between them and laid them clearly at 

530
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:10,750
the feet,
not have stellan but of Lennon.

531
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,650
And so that was also a major blow 
because it,

532
00:30:13,651 --> 00:30:14,484
it undermined the remaining argument of 
the left way radical left wing 

533
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:19,860
apologists in,
in,

534
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,703
in the West for the,
for the viability of Marxist slash 

535
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:25,090
communist doctrines.

536
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,660
And you still hear people today,
many people when they're faced with the,

537
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:29,651
you know,
if they're,

538
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:30,484
if they're,
if they're Marxist in their orientation 

539
00:30:32,111 --> 00:30:32,944
and they're faced with the data 
pertaining to what happened in the 

540
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,670
Soviet Union,
they'll say something like,

541
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,653
well that wasn't real Marxism,
but one of the things that you might 

542
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:41,710
answer to that is,
well fine,

543
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:42,544
except that in every bloody country in 
the world where that doctrine was 

544
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:46,660
implemented,
new,

545
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:49,880
regardless of the wide cultural 
differences between the culture,

546
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,760
say the Soviet Union,
China,

547
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,713
Cambodia and so forth.
Exactly the same thing happened every 

548
00:30:56,141 --> 00:30:56,974
time.
And we still have a great example of 

549
00:30:58,331 --> 00:30:59,164
that today in the form of North Korea.
I don't know if you've ever looked at a 

550
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:04,420
map of the world at night.
You know,

551
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:06,400
you can get a map of the entire globe at
night.

552
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,980
You look at South Korea,
it's lit up like jewels.

553
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,813
It's nothing but light like the east 
coast of the United States and Canada 

554
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,173
and North Korea is dark.
And the reason for that is that 50 60 

555
00:31:17,561 --> 00:31:18,394
years of barbaric communist despotic 
rule means a country that's completely 

556
00:31:22,571 --> 00:31:23,404
in an industrialized where every single 
person is male nourished or starving to 

557
00:31:27,401 --> 00:31:28,234
death,
where everyone lives in terror all the 

558
00:31:29,741 --> 00:31:30,574
time and where there's nothing but the 
continual production of labor in labor 

559
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:36,790
camps just like in the Soviet Union and 
Maoist China.

560
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,043
So if we were willing to pay attention,
we could still see examples of that 

561
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:42,250
today.
And that's not an anomaly.

562
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:43,683
North Korea is exactly what you'd expect
given the doctrines upon which it's 

563
00:31:46,241 --> 00:31:48,040
founded.
So,

564
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,830
all right,
so more on the ghoulag.

565
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,480
At one level.
The Gulag archipelago traces the history

566
00:31:59,481 --> 00:32:00,314
of forced labor camps that existed in 
the Soviet Union from 1918 to 1956 

567
00:32:04,731 --> 00:32:05,564
started with Lenin's original decrees 
shortly after the October Revolution 

568
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,003
establishing the legal and practical 
framework for a series of camps where 

569
00:32:12,591 --> 00:32:13,424
political prisoners and ordinary 
criminals would be sentenced to forced 

570
00:32:15,681 --> 00:32:16,514
labor.
It describes and discusses the waves of 

571
00:32:18,441 --> 00:32:19,274
purchase assembling the show trials in 
context of the development of the 

572
00:32:23,211 --> 00:32:24,044
Greater Gulag system with particular 
attention to the legal and bureaucratic 

573
00:32:26,781 --> 00:32:27,614
development.
The legal and historical narrative ends 

574
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:34,781
in 1956 the time of Nikita Khrushchev 
secret speech at the 20th Party Congress

575
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,740
denouncing Stalin's personality cult,
his power,

576
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:42,620
and the surveillance that pervaded the 
stele and error.

577
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,910
Though the speech was not published in 
the USSR for a long time,

578
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,630
it was a break with the most atrocious 
practices of the Gulag system.

579
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,970
Solzhenitsyn was aware,
however,

580
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,133
that the outlines of the system had 
survived and could be revived and 

581
00:32:56,871 --> 00:32:58,430
expanded by future leaders.

582
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,920
Despite the efforts by soldier knits and
and others to confront the legacy of the

583
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:04,754
ghoulag.
The reality of the camps remained taboo 

584
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:07,514
until the 1980s well crew share of the 
Communist Party and the Soviet Union 

585
00:33:11,421 --> 00:33:12,254
supporters in the West viewed the 
ghoulag is a deviation of the of Stalin 

586
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,893
Solzhenitsyn and many among the 
opposition tended to view it as a 

587
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:23,660
systematic fault of Soviet political 
culture and an inevitable outcome of the

588
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:24,494
Bolshevik political project.
Parallel to this historical and legal 

589
00:33:28,431 --> 00:33:29,264
narrative,
Solzhenitsyn follows the typical course 

590
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:34,580
of a Zack,
a slang term for inmate derived from the

591
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:38,950
widely used abbreviations zed slash k 
four [inaudible].

592
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,123
Zack,
you chenny I guess prisoner through the 

593
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:44,234
Gulag starting with arrest show,
trial and initial internment transport 

594
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:53,450
to the archipelago,
treatment of prisoners in general living

595
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:55,010
conditions,
slave labor,

596
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:57,350
gangs and the technical prison camp 
system,

597
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,880
camp rebellions and strikes,
the practice of internal exile following

598
00:34:01,881 --> 00:34:02,714
completion of the original prison 
sentence and the ultimate but not 

599
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:08,740
guaranteed release of the prisoner along
the ways.

600
00:34:08,741 --> 00:34:09,574
Soldier Knutson's examinations detailed 
the trivial and commonplace advance of 

601
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:13,874
an average prisoners of life,
of an average prisoners of light 

602
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,373
prisoner's life,
as well as specific and noteworthy 

603
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,250
events during the history of the gulag 
system,

604
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:24,170
including revolts and uprising.

605
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:31,400
Aside from using his experiences as an 
inmate at a scientific prison,

606
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,013
Sojun hits and draws the testimony draws
from the testimony of 227 fellow 

607
00:34:38,031 --> 00:34:38,864
prisoners,
the firsthand accounts which based the 

608
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:41,324
work.
One chapter of the third volume of the 

609
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:43,994
book is written by a prisoner named 
George your gay probably Tenno whose 

610
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:48,074
exploits enraptured soldier knits and to
the extent that he offered to name 10 o 

611
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:52,214
as coauthor of the book,
Tenno declined soldier knits and also 

612
00:34:55,401 --> 00:34:56,234
poetically reintroduces his character of
Yvonne Denisovich toward the conclusion 

613
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:03,530
of the book when questioned by the 
book's author,

614
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,393
if he has faithfully recounted the story
of the Gulag Denisovich now apparently 

615
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:13,631
freed from the camps replies that you 
the author have not even begun the sheer

616
00:35:15,351 --> 00:35:16,184
volume of firsthand testimony in primary
documentation that social knits and 

617
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:20,443
managed to assemble in the Gulag 
archipelago made all subsequent Soviet 

618
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:27,200
and kgb attempts to discredit the work 
useless.

619
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,513
Much of the impact of the tree ties 
stems from the closely detailed stories 

620
00:35:32,271 --> 00:35:35,870
of interrogation routines,
prison indignities,

621
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,570
and especially section three camp 
massacres,

622
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,523
massacres and inhuman practices.
There had been works about the Soviet 

623
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:44,934
prison camp system before and its 
existence had been known to the Western 

624
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:48,594
public since the 1930s however,
never before had the general reading 

625
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:55,290
public been brought face to face with 
the horrors of the Gulag.

626
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,860
In this way.
The controversy surrounding this text in

627
00:35:58,861 --> 00:35:59,694
particular was largely due to the way 
soldier knits and definitively and 

628
00:36:03,691 --> 00:36:08,691
painstakingly laid the theoretical,
legal and practical origins of the Gulag

629
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,220
System at Lennon's feet,
not Stalin's.

630
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,383
According to Solzhenitsyn testimony,
Stalin merely amplified a concentration 

631
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:17,034
camp system that was already in place.
This is significant as many western 

632
00:36:20,701 --> 00:36:21,534
intellectuals viewed the Soviet 
concentration camp system as a 

633
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:25,184
stalinists aberration,
soldier knits and documented that the 

634
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:28,854
Soviet government could not govern 
without the threat of imprisonment and 

635
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:36,240
that Soviet economy depended on the 
productivity of the forced labor camps,

636
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,103
especially in so far as the development 
and construction of public works and 

637
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:41,040
infrastructure.

638
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,873
We're concerned this put into doubt the 
entire moral standing of the Soviet 

639
00:36:45,961 --> 00:36:49,920
system in western Europe.
The book eventually contributed strongly

640
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:54,600
to a need for rethinking of the 
historical role of Lennon with the Gulag

641
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:58,710
Archipelago Lenin's political and 
historical legacy became problematic.

642
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,653
Yeah,
problematic and his and the those 

643
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:02,784
factions of western Communist parties 
who still based their economic and 

644
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:08,280
political ideology on Lennon.
We're faced with,

645
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,680
we're left with a heavy burden of proof 
against them.

646
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,173
George F Kennan,
the influential US diplomat called the 

647
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:17,710
Gulag archipelago,
the most powerful thing,

648
00:37:17,711 --> 00:37:22,050
google indictment of a political regime 
ever to be levied in modern times.

649
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:25,410
The book was published at a time when 
many communists in the west.

650
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,680
We're already rethinking their 
relationships with the USSR.

651
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,663
As many were deeply disappointed by the 
invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 in 

652
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:35,694
Germany.
It sparked discussions not only about 

653
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:40,890
Lennon ism but also how to deal with the
memory of World War II.

654
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,720
In an interview with German weekly Zeit 
British historian,

655
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:46,643
Orlando,
Fiji has asserted that many ghoulag 

656
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:49,943
inmates he interviewed for his research 
identified so strongly with the book's 

657
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:54,234
contents that they became unable to 
distinguish between their own 

658
00:37:56,371 --> 00:37:57,204
experiences and what they read.
The Gulag archipelago spoke for a whole 

659
00:38:00,481 --> 00:38:03,120
nation and was the voice of those who 
had suffered

660
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:05,963
after the KGB had confiscated a social 
knutson's materials in Moscow during 

661
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:14,871
1957 to 1967 the preparatory drafts of 
the Gulag archipelago,

662
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:16,224
we're turning.
It turned into finished manuscripts 

663
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,033
sometimes in hiding at his friend's 
homes in the Moscow region and 

664
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:23,394
elsewhere.
Well held at the KGB Lubyanka prison in 

665
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:30,060
1945 Solzhenitsyn had befriended Arnold 
Susi,

666
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:30,923
a lawyer and former Estonian minister of
education who had been taken captive 

667
00:38:34,681 --> 00:38:36,340
after Soviet Union occupied

668
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,173
Estonia in 1940 Solzhenitsyn entrusted 
suzy with the original type and proof 

669
00:38:41,531 --> 00:38:45,970
read manuscript of the finish work after
copies had been made of it both on paper

670
00:38:45,971 --> 00:38:48,430
and on Microfilm.
Arnold Susie's daughter,

671
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:49,563
Heli.
Suzy subsequently kept the master copy 

672
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:56,590
hidden from the KGB in Estonia until the
dissolution of the Soviet Union.

673
00:38:56,591 --> 00:38:57,424
In 1991 the KGB seized one of the only 
three extent copies of the texts still 

674
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:08,650
on Soviet soil and the people who held 
the copies were unaware of the existence

675
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:09,484
of the other copies this they achieved 
after interrogating Eliza Vata Vora and 

676
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,413
scanner one of Solzhenitsyn's trusted 
typists who knew where the typed copy 

677
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:23,620
was hidden within days of release by the
KGB,

678
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,000
she hanged herself.

679
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:26,710
Okay.

680
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,543
The first edition of the work was 
published in Russian by the French 

681
00:39:29,651 --> 00:39:30,484
publishing house.
Additions destroy a few days after 

682
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:33,544
Christmas,
1973 they had received it go ahead from 

683
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,664
Solzhenitsyn,
but had decided to release the work 

684
00:39:38,261 --> 00:39:41,080
about 10 days earlier than he had 
expected.

685
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,093
News of the nature of the work 
immediately caused a stir and 

686
00:39:44,111 --> 00:39:47,860
translations into many other languages,
followed within the next few months,

687
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,380
sometimes produced in a race against 
time.

688
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,920
American Thomas Whitney produced the 
English version.

689
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,933
The English and French translations of 
volume one appeared in the spring and 

690
00:39:57,131 --> 00:40:02,131
summer of 1974 Solzhenitsyn had wanted 
the manuscript to be published in Russia

691
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:03,514
first,
but knew this was impossible under 

692
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:08,980
conditions then extent the work made a 
profound impact internationally.

693
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,920
Not only did it provoke energetic debate
in the West,

694
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,913
a mere six weeks after the work had left
breezy and presses soldier nets and 

695
00:40:15,731 --> 00:40:16,564
himself was forced into exile because 
possession of the manuscript incurred 

696
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,440
the risk of a long prison sentence for 
anti-soviet activities.

697
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:27,400
Solzhenitsyn never worked on the 
manuscript in complete form since he was

698
00:40:27,401 --> 00:40:28,234
under constant kgb surveillance.
He worked on only one part of the 

699
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:34,330
manuscript at a time so as not to put 
the full book into jeopardy.

700
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,880
If he happened to be arrested for this 
reason,

701
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:37,714
he secretive the various parts of the 
work throughout Moscow and the 

702
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:43,030
surrounding countryside in the care of 
trusted friends.

703
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,560
Sometimes purportedly visiting them on 
the,

704
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,503
on the social calls,
but actually working on the manuscript 

705
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:50,043
in their homes.

706
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:51,900
Okay.

707
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,680
All right.
So now I want to show you some things.

708
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,310
I haven't done this before,
but we'll see how it goes.

709
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,950
I'm going to show you something that 
happened recently.

710
00:41:01,951 --> 00:41:04,920
Some of you may be aware of this and 
some of you not.

711
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:05,754
So this is a video about there was a,
there was a town meeting that a number 

712
00:41:11,881 --> 00:41:13,010
of people,
uh,

713
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:14,850
uh,
spoke out,

714
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:20,030
including one shopkeeper from New York.
And after the meeting he was interviewed

715
00:41:23,671 --> 00:41:25,290
by the PR,
the press,

716
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:26,124
the TV,
and one of the attendees at the meeting 

717
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:33,980
was upset about the fact that the press 
was concentrating on him

718
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,580
instead of concentrating on what she 
regarded as the issues at hand.

719
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,550
So I'm going to play this for you to 
begin with.

720
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:41,384
Now what I'm trying to show you,
I want to show you what it means for 

721
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:44,654
someone to be ideologically possessed.
And so you can tell when you're talking 

722
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:51,470
to someone like that,
because this is something I learned from

723
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:52,304
reading soldier Netsim is because you 
can predict absolutely everything 

724
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:55,724
they're going to say.
Once you know the algorithmic 

725
00:41:57,591 --> 00:41:59,870
substructure of their political 
ideology,

726
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:02,780
which is usually predicated on about 
five or six axioms.

727
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:06,800
You can use the axioms to automatically 
generate speech content.

728
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,813
You don't even have to hear the person.
You can just predict what they're going 

729
00:42:10,251 --> 00:42:11,084
to say.
And so that alleviates any 

730
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:15,080
responsibility whatsoever they have for 
thinking.

731
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,063
And it also allows them to believe that 
they have full control and full 

732
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,780
knowledge over the,
not only for controlling,

733
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,633
for,
for all knowledge about the entire 

734
00:42:23,061 --> 00:42:23,894
world,
but also the capacity to distinguish 

735
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,503
without a moment's thought between those
who are on the side of the good and 

736
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:29,804
those who are not.
And that's where the danger really 

737
00:42:31,371 --> 00:42:32,660
comes.
So anyways,

738
00:42:32,661 --> 00:42:33,740
we'll take a look at this.
And

739
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,960
so right now
the news is

740
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:47,650
a person whose daughter
was a heroin addict.

741
00:42:49,091 --> 00:42:52,870
And I think what he said in his public 
comments and he's pro bunker,

742
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,143
he's probably cops.
And so he's the one getting interviewed 

743
00:42:56,831 --> 00:43:01,420
and there were like a million people who
have spoken about how they've been,

744
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,740
uh,
abused by the cops,

745
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,890
that they're not being,
they're not being spoken to you.

746
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,960
I don't need the person who's 
[inaudible].

747
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:10,900
He's little set of tasks and congress.
So they got this and that's the one that

748
00:43:10,901 --> 00:43:14,650
they use.
No idea.

749
00:43:14,651 --> 00:43:15,484
We'll find out.

750
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,450
I have a question.

751
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,200
Yeah,
you want my day?

752
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,130
Okay.
Humongous.

753
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,770
Humongous.
Well you mungus humungous well,

754
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,150
I guess humongous.
Humongous mom.

755
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:52,580
That's what it is.
Humongous.

756
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,390
What is that?
Sexual harassment.

757
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,220
So why did you say that to me?
What?

758
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,510
Humongous walk she might go spoke 
humongous wall.

759
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:01,403
Is that sexual harassment?
Is that what you just did when you said 

760
00:44:03,001 --> 00:44:03,834
that to me?
Why?

761
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,310
Why would you say that to me?
Yes,

762
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:07,080
but my name.
Why would you say that to me?

763
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,820
Why would I say,
why would you say that to me?

764
00:44:08,821 --> 00:44:09,900
What would you ask me?
My name?

765
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,300
Humongous one.
Humongous.

766
00:44:12,301 --> 00:44:13,134
Well,

767
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,000
humongous,
humongous wall

768
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:18,913
section.
And just just it to me in a sexually 

769
00:44:20,531 --> 00:44:22,110
harassing way.
Yeah,

770
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,580
he did.
He said,

771
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:29,610
do you know what my name is Hugh Mungus.
Awesome.

772
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,470
Just sexually harassed me up.
Yes.

773
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:34,620
Yeah,
that's right.

774
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:40,130
Human does wash
pointing to yourself.

775
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,513
You're actually pointing to your body 
and you're actually pointing to your 

776
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:47,310
body parts and saying that you're 
humongous.

777
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,473
You're actually doing that and this is 
the person who just got interviewed and 

778
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:52,343
the probe bunker person of color
represent us using you as a token and 

779
00:44:58,861 --> 00:45:01,320
then you speak to me in a sexually 
harassing manner.

780
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,280
Defendant Gulf Matta.
Disgusting.

781
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:46,410
Did you ask him to leave?
Did you ask him?

782
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:54,240
What is your name?
What is your name?

783
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,580
What is your name?
What is your name?

784
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,770
What is your name?
You want it to this 80 we are hearing.

785
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,020
You need to tell me what your name is.
My name is to know

786
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:17,360
your name.
What is your name?

787
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:27,990
What is your name?
What is your full name?

788
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,180
What is your full name and what company 
do you want?

789
00:46:33,181 --> 00:46:36,170
Phone
protection.

790
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:41,190
My name is to know
the wrong person.

791
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:51,970
He just
asked me

792
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:05,580
security,
not just happy.

793
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:09,510
Didn't get the cops.
Get a cop here today.

794
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,990
Why did you do nothing about the 
passenger?

795
00:47:14,991 --> 00:47:17,030
Who sexually harassed me?
I made it

796
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:26,380
back
with a gentleman.

797
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,150
The gentleman gentleman's gone already.
Why are you here?

798
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,113
Why are you still here?
Because we're being really loud and 

799
00:47:36,671 --> 00:47:41,671
we're disrupting being loud a crime
for herself.

800
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,660
I understand,
man,

801
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:47,860
you don't understand anything.

802
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:54,920
So this got a lot of attention online.
It's just so you know.

803
00:47:54,921 --> 00:47:59,300
And so then she responded because she 
was quite intensely criticized.

804
00:47:59,301 --> 00:48:00,134
So here's her response.
Now I want you to listen to how she 

805
00:48:02,001 --> 00:48:02,834
speaks.

806
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,730
My name is Anna and I'm doing this video
because we need to talk.

807
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,073
It's become clear to me that a great 
deal of us suffer from the illness of 

808
00:48:10,391 --> 00:48:12,820
patriarchy.
And it's not just the men who suffer.

809
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:14,800
Women can be patriarchal too,

810
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,800
really?
But why would they be patriarchal?

811
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:26,210
Tore to other women?
That's a stupid,

812
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:26,360
okay.

813
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,690
So many things in our system today come 
from patriarchy,

814
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,000
including racism,
colonialism,

815
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:33,830
capitalism,
classism,

816
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:35,300
and of course sex.
Yeah.

817
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:39,110
Wow.
She thinks she knows everything.

818
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:40,123
Yes.
All these experts with our degrees can 

819
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:45,110
just go home.
One thing to remember though,

820
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:48,200
it's hard to see something when we're 
really close to it.

821
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:49,333
You have to step back sometimes look at 
a system critically to see what others 

822
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:55,670
might be seeing.
I wonder if she's done.

823
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:00,260
I'm a woman of color,
so I'm going to talk about my experience

824
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:01,693
that many other marginalized people such
as indigenous peoples and Queer and 

825
00:49:05,181 --> 00:49:08,390
transgender people and gender 
nonconforming people will have their own

826
00:49:08,391 --> 00:49:09,710
thoughts on this.
Also

827
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:15,090
indigenous who and what the hell is 
gender nonconforming?

828
00:49:15,371 --> 00:49:18,310
What are all these labels?
What is she even talking about?

829
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:21,280
Why is this woman thinks she can speak 
for everyone?

830
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,140
I mean,
who the hell is she anyways?

831
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:24,670
What a drama queen

832
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:28,800
challenge is that it is very hard for 
those who are marginalized such as women

833
00:49:28,801 --> 00:49:29,634
of color to express how they feel 
without being called the angry brown 

834
00:49:33,391 --> 00:49:36,840
woman or the angry black woman or the 
nagging woman.

835
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:38,540
Oh crazy.
My God,

836
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:39,383
she just won't stop talking.
But sometimes I do wonder what women of 

837
00:49:42,151 --> 00:49:45,150
color thinking when I make a cross 
racial or sexual joke in front of them.

838
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:46,920
And then I say,
just kidding.

839
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,620
And then afterwards,
why do they always turn me down?

840
00:49:49,621 --> 00:49:50,610
When I asked him to dinner,

841
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,590
it's because of a phenomenon called 
white fragility and male fragility.

842
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:58,340
White liberals and men in general have 
been told over and over again,

843
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,413
but if they just never used the n word 
and they never talk about race and then 

844
00:50:01,811 --> 00:50:05,030
never physically molest anyone and 
they're not racist or sexist.

845
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,103
So when I point out that actually the 
system of power we live in ensures that 

846
00:50:09,411 --> 00:50:10,244
all white people are racist and all men 
are sexist because they profit from a 

847
00:50:14,001 --> 00:50:16,910
system that marginalizes people of color
and non males.

848
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,133
They attack me just as they've attacked 
women of color for centuries to retain 

849
00:50:22,041 --> 00:50:23,060
the power structure.

850
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:26,710
Oh,
she's the sexiest one.

851
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,320
She's the racist more.
Why?

852
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:30,610
Why does she hate me?
Yeah.

853
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:31,444
So I make more money because I'm a man 
and I have a lot of privilege and my 

854
00:50:35,711 --> 00:50:39,490
voice matters at every sphere of life.
But I didn't ask for that.

855
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:40,833
That doesn't make me racist or sexist.
She talks as if men don't have any 

856
00:50:43,831 --> 00:50:46,500
problems.
I haven't had a raise in three years.

857
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:47,311
I mean,
yeah.

858
00:50:47,311 --> 00:50:48,144
I haven't spoken up for women or done 
anything constructive to help women or 

859
00:50:51,721 --> 00:50:52,554
people of color and I take my privileges
without question and I live happily in 

860
00:50:57,301 --> 00:51:01,110
my own little bubble,
but that doesn't mean that I profit from

861
00:51:01,111 --> 00:51:03,210
their suffering.
It's not my fault.

862
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,730
They're marginalized.
I didn't marginalize them,

863
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,280
so why should I do anything to help 
them?

864
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:09,503
Just because I make more money,
have access to all the education and 

865
00:51:12,931 --> 00:51:15,300
resources and housing and jobs.

866
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:18,603
Recently I was sexually harassed by a 
man in public on camera and the new 

867
00:51:22,891 --> 00:51:26,650
stations posted the video without my 
permission with the question,

868
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:32,010
do you consider this sexual harassment?
This led to a lot of people attacking me

869
00:51:32,081 --> 00:51:33,970
and going off to me all over social 
media.

870
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:38,470
This is what patriarchy does.
It causes everyone to attack the victim.

871
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:42,910
The one who is most vulnerable.
This protects the system of power,

872
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,073
which is male sexual dominance.
How do we even know she's telling the 

873
00:51:47,231 --> 00:51:48,064
truth about sex or harassment?
I saw that video and the online 

874
00:51:50,531 --> 00:51:51,364
reactions from all the men and yeah,
they were threatening rape and violence 

875
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:58,240
and death all while accusing her of 
overreacting.

876
00:51:58,810 --> 00:51:59,643
But just because she's putting her 
physical safety on the line to talk 

877
00:52:01,991 --> 00:52:03,970
about this,
it doesn't mean she's right.

878
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:07,420
The main complaint that I raised my 
voice,

879
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:08,853
they questioned my sanity because I 
spoke up a patriarchal society wants 

880
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:14,320
women to shut up.

881
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,353
Okay.
So now the next thing that happened was 

882
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,533
she started a funding campaign to,
to help her out and get her to spread 

883
00:52:22,021 --> 00:52:23,280
her message.
So,

884
00:52:23,281 --> 00:52:24,290
okay.
So that,

885
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:29,130
that was interesting.
And then what happened was this guy here

886
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:34,470
decided that he was going to start a 
funding campaign for humongous.

887
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:35,993
And so he started a cam,
a funding campaign on a website devoted 

888
00:52:39,421 --> 00:52:41,640
to funding such projects and they shut 
him down.

889
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:47,070
So then he started another funding 
campaign and he raised $140,000.

890
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,430
And so this is his interview with 
humongous,

891
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:51,680
Oh,
let me turn up my mic,

892
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:53,780
rudy,
and let's see if that helps you.

893
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:56,930
Is this better?
Is that better?

894
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,370
Oh yes,
brother.

895
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:00,193
So you said you were,
you were working this morning blowing 

896
00:53:02,181 --> 00:53:03,410
leaves.
Yeah,

897
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,253
so I was,
uh,

898
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:08,030
in downtown Bellevue and Seattle blowing
what us,

899
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:10,490
what a salt of the earth man.
Oh,

900
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,173
Jessica pledge $130,000.
And he's out there blown some fucking 

901
00:53:15,771 --> 00:53:18,050
leaves.
Y'All can learn something from your boy.

902
00:53:18,051 --> 00:53:19,640
Humongous here.
God Damn,

903
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,410
you don't look,
we got a new president.

904
00:53:21,411 --> 00:53:25,260
But that didn't mean that the leaves 
don't need to be still picked up.

905
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,540
Rudy,
how are you feeling right now?

906
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:29,400
Dude,
I feel loved.

907
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,710
I am really,
truly grateful.

908
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:32,544
And I mean,
not last weekend I was little trogger 

909
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:38,620
and broke down.
Ready for your eviction.

910
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:43,050
I'm looking out at the sky and I'm 
thinking,

911
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,860
I think I'm kind of screwed today,
you know?

912
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:50,880
So I took myself down to a church and I 
went and prayed.

913
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,373
I went and did confession,
but my confession didn't meet the 

914
00:53:54,241 --> 00:53:57,660
criteria at the church.
I swear to God.

915
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,970
What does that mean?
The,

916
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,280
the,
the,

917
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:03,990
the father stepped out into the 
confession room.

918
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:05,520
She said,
oh no.

919
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:06,990
He says,
he says,

920
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,920
excuse me,
but uh,

921
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,350
we're going to have to,
uh,

922
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:15,540
maybe do this aftermath.
And he walked me to the door and I said,

923
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:19,770
is there a certain way to confess my sin
so maybe I can,

924
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:21,303
uh,

925
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,600
get it off?
How from seven,

926
00:54:22,601 --> 00:54:23,241
eight,
God,

927
00:54:23,241 --> 00:54:24,890
I mean,
I'm just asking God for help.

928
00:54:24,891 --> 00:54:25,800
And the dude's like,
no,

929
00:54:25,801 --> 00:54:27,710
not here.
We don't want your ass here.

930
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,720
I'd never heard of such a thing.

931
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:30,623
It's actually really funny.
It's one of those things that make you 

932
00:54:32,071 --> 00:54:32,904
go,
Ooh.

933
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:34,163
And then he went out the front door and 
I waited until I got off the church 

934
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:42,180
property and I said,
what that APP was.

935
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,950
So I went up.
So,

936
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:47,610
you know,
be in your mind as I'm thinking,

937
00:54:47,611 --> 00:54:51,240
I'm hungry after that,
when I see Taco Bell,

938
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:52,843
yeah,
go over and I've got 75 cents and I'm 

939
00:54:55,141 --> 00:54:59,010
thinking,
I wonder if I did a little short on that

940
00:54:59,011 --> 00:54:59,844
one.
And I'm going and I think I'm going to 

941
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:05,970
try another church halfway between the 
Mexican restaurant,

942
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,570
Larson's bakery or the church I was 
going to,

943
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,680
I get a call from you.
Wow.

944
00:55:10,681 --> 00:55:13,020
Are you serious word of God?
I am not.

945
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:15,560
I am not kidding.
That same old test and I actually,

946
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:17,430
incredible.
Hello.

947
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:20,920
All right.
I remember you said when I called you,

948
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,510
you didn't know it was me and you're 
like,

949
00:55:22,511 --> 00:55:23,650
I swear to God,
I'm about to,

950
00:55:23,651 --> 00:55:26,470
I'm having a midlife crisis.
And then you like,

951
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,740
like as if you were speaking to yourself
and then you said,

952
00:55:29,741 --> 00:55:30,700
hey,
who is this?

953
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:31,563
Do you remember that?

954
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,810
I remember that.
Yeah,

955
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:36,650
and I hired,
I thought you were somebody else.

956
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:37,820
Okay.
Yeah.

957
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:39,243
You said
because that lady is getting funded and 

958
00:55:46,341 --> 00:55:47,174
I'm going to fund you because it's not 
fair how she's degraded you and I'm 

959
00:55:50,991 --> 00:55:55,520
going,
you know I'm going to keep going to that

960
00:55:55,521 --> 00:55:56,354
shirt.

961
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:58,690
Apparently I'm God's messenger.
What's that?

962
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,620
Am I control the whole time?
God,

963
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:01,970
God bless him.
Papa.

964
00:56:01,971 --> 00:56:03,110
Bless you.
That's okay.

965
00:56:03,111 --> 00:56:05,240
You're actually ascending to heaven 
right now.

966
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:06,283
It looks like.
I think God is trying to tell us 

967
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:09,164
something right now because the sun,
there's a stairway to heaven coming out 

968
00:56:11,871 --> 00:56:13,640
right from the lead top.
Left side.

969
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,740
Oh,
there's the light.

970
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,740
There's a light.
God finally answered your prayers.

971
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:23,230
I really sure.
How is it that you have and films across

972
00:56:23,231 --> 00:56:27,730
America and around the world?
I really want to,

973
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,793
I can't,
I can't really put it into words other 

974
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:33,910
than that I,
I realized that,

975
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:37,600
uh,
what I learned from others,

976
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:43,050
I'm carrying that message of down with 
dope up with pope.

977
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,480
I feel like if there was a bible written
today,

978
00:56:46,481 --> 00:56:47,314
I almost feel like that story would be 
in their humongous have left the church 

979
00:56:50,651 --> 00:56:54,670
and despair walk to Taco Bell with 75 
cents in his pocket.

980
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:57,670
And as he realized he didn't have enough
for a Taco,

981
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,190
he got a ring up,
not from Ethan,

982
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:05,830
but from the spirit of Papa John who 
worked through him and mysterious ways.

983
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,173
Yeah.
You know what I'm gonna do is I'm going 

984
00:57:09,861 --> 00:57:13,580
to go drop $300 off to this,
to that churches,

985
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,220
odd shows,
sports program.

986
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:22,120
Just because [inaudible] a opportunity 
to help pull people up and not tear them

987
00:57:23,391 --> 00:57:25,640
down.
No Gate.

988
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,700
Let's date
God.

989
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:29,803
I want to make it clear that the people 
that supported me in this effort 

990
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:38,990
fiscally,
I will not abuse this.

991
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:43,670
I'm not going to come in and turn it 
into some raging drunk that you're going

992
00:57:43,671 --> 00:57:45,800
to see a Frickin padding mine.

993
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:46,783
Yeah,
yeah.

994
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,080
Oh God.
That's,

995
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:51,120
that's,
that's honestly our worst nightmare.

996
00:57:51,121 --> 00:57:52,830
We're all going to be like,
oh fuck.

997
00:57:52,831 --> 00:57:53,820
Where do we do?

998
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:58,350
I've already done that stuff when I was 
in my twenties I'm 52 I,

999
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:01,170
there's no way you got to be.
There's,

1000
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,210
I mean,
I hope,

1001
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,570
well,
we'll be fine.

1002
00:58:05,571 --> 00:58:07,880
You on facebook now.
Okay.

1003
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,690
We'll be watching the humongous journey

1004
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:13,810
and God bless you all up from this 
country and around the world.

1005
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,400
I mean,
I'm just absolutely grateful.

1006
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,673
Okay,

1007
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:18,583
so this is from the Gulag archipelago.
One of my informants has told me how 

1008
00:58:22,281 --> 00:58:26,690
executions were carried out at a deck,
a camp on the pitcher river.

1009
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:28,873
They would take the opposition members 
with their things out of the camp 

1010
00:58:32,661 --> 00:58:33,494
compound on prisoner transport at night 
and outside the camp pound stood the 

1011
00:58:36,831 --> 00:58:37,664
small house of the third section,
the condemned man or taken into a room 

1012
00:58:41,511 --> 00:58:44,720
one at a time and they're the camp get 
guards sprang on them.

1013
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:45,703
Their mouths were stuffed with something
soft and their arms were bound with 

1014
00:58:49,431 --> 00:58:50,264
cords behind their backs and see these 
were political prisoners who oppose the 

1015
00:58:53,181 --> 00:58:55,430
Soviet system,
the condemned man.

1016
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:56,563
Then they were led out into the 
courtyard where harnessed carts were 

1017
00:58:58,581 --> 00:58:59,414
waiting.
The bound prisoners were piled on the 

1018
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:05,360
carts from five to seven at a time and 
driven off to the Gorkha,

1019
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:06,463
the camp cemetery on arrival.
They were tipped into big pits that had 

1020
00:59:09,801 --> 00:59:12,440
already been prepared and buried alive,

1021
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:17,070
not out of brutality.
No,

1022
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:21,590
it had been ascertained that when 
dragging and them,

1023
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:25,100
it was much easier to cope with living 
people then with corpses.

1024
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:26,283
The work went on for many nights at Atac
and that is how are the moral political 

1025
00:59:30,771 --> 00:59:35,771
unity of our party was achieved.
This is from Viktor Frankl,

1026
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,340
from his experiences in the Nazi 
concentration camps.

1027
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:45,820
The most ghastly moment of the 24 hours 
of camp life was the awakening when at a

1028
00:59:46,881 --> 00:59:47,714
still nocturnal hour.
The three shrill blows of a whistle 

1029
00:59:50,271 --> 00:59:51,104
Taurus pity leslie from are exhausted 
sleep and from the longings in our 

1030
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:55,394
dreams.
We then began the tussle with our wet 

1031
00:59:56,911 --> 01:00:00,050
shoes into which we could scarcely force
our feet,

1032
01:00:00,051 --> 01:00:00,884
which were swollen and sore with edema 
and there were the usual moans and 

1033
01:00:04,791 --> 01:00:05,624
groans about petty troubles such as the 
snapping of wires which replaced shoe 

1034
01:00:10,221 --> 01:00:11,054
laces.
And one morning I heard someone whom I 

1035
01:00:12,711 --> 01:00:13,544
knew to be brave and dignified cry like 
a child because he finally had to go to 

1036
01:00:17,571 --> 01:00:20,540
the snowy marching grounds in his bare 
feet

1037
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:27,140
as his shoes were too shrunk and for him
to wear in those ghastly moments,

1038
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:28,493
I found a little bit of comfort,
a small piece of bread which I drew out 

1039
01:00:31,771 --> 01:00:34,620
of my pocket and munched with absorbed 
delight

1040
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:42,840
from Solzhenitsyn
in cold lower than 60 degrees below zero

1041
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:48,090
work days were written off.

1042
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,090
In other words,
on such days,

1043
01:00:51,091 --> 01:00:51,924
the records showed that the workers had 
not gone out to work because 60 below 

1044
01:00:55,711 --> 01:00:56,544
was the cutoff for work,
but they chased them out anyways and 

1045
01:00:59,401 --> 01:01:02,730
whatever they squeezed out of them on 
those days was added to the other days.

1046
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:07,850
Thereby raising the percentages and the 
survival medical section wrote off those

1047
01:01:08,821 --> 01:01:09,654
who froze to death on such cool days on 
some other basis and the ones who were 

1048
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:13,794
left who could no longer walk and 
restraining every sinew to crawl along 

1049
01:01:18,181 --> 01:01:19,014
on all fours on the way back to camp,
the convoy simply shot so that they 

1050
01:01:23,251 --> 01:01:25,890
wouldn't escape before they could come 
back to get them.

1051
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:33,050
This is from William Blake.
Oh rose,

1052
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:34,003
thou art sick.
The invisible worm that flies in the 

1053
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:38,594
night in the howling storm at found out,
died bad of crimson joy and his dark 

1054
01:01:43,611 --> 01:01:45,920
secret.
Love does die.

1055
01:01:45,921 --> 01:01:46,754
Life Destroy
Solzhenitsyn Mac Beth self 

1056
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:56,921
justifications for his murders were 
feeble and his conscience devoured him.

1057
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,633
Even I ego was a little lamb to the 
imagination and spiritual strength of 

1058
01:02:02,121 --> 01:02:05,510
Shakespeare's evildoers stopped short,
had a dozen corpses.

1059
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:07,760
That was because they add no ideology

1060
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:10,143
ideology.
That is what gives evil doing its long 

1061
01:02:12,971 --> 01:02:13,804
sought justification and gives the evil 
doer that necessary steadfastness and 

1062
01:02:18,371 --> 01:02:23,250
determination
that is the social theory which helps to

1063
01:02:23,251 --> 01:02:24,084
make this act.
His Act seemed good instead of bad in 

1064
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:27,624
his own and other's eyes.
That was how the agents of the 

1065
01:02:29,131 --> 01:02:32,460
inquisition fortified their wills by 
invoking Christianity.

1066
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:33,443
The conqueror is a foreign lands by 
extolling the grand year of their 

1067
01:02:35,971 --> 01:02:38,460
motherland,
the colonizers by civilization,

1068
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:42,480
the Nazis by race and the Jacobins early
and late by equality,

1069
01:02:42,481 --> 01:02:45,330
brotherhood and the happiness of future 
generations.

1070
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:48,390
Without evildoers there would have been 
new archipelago,

1071
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:54,170
fire,
fire

1072
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,130
branches,
crackle,

1073
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:02,230
and the night wind of late autumn blows 
the flame of the bonfire back and forth.

1074
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:06,670
The compound is dark.
I'm alone at the bonfire and I can bring

1075
01:03:06,671 --> 01:03:10,520
it still some more carpenter shavings.
The compound here is a privileged one,

1076
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:14,620
so privileged that it is almost as if I 
were out in freedom.

1077
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:19,480
This is an island of paradise.
This is the Marfino [inaudible],

1078
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:20,463
a scientific institutes staffed with 
prisoners and its most privileged 

1079
01:03:23,951 --> 01:03:25,750
period.
No one is overseeing me,

1080
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:29,410
calling me to a sale,
chasing me away from the bonfire.

1081
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,380
And even then it is chilly in the 
penetrating wind,

1082
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:37,450
but she who has already been standing in
the wind for hours,

1083
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:40,210
her arms straight down,
her head drooping,

1084
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:43,360
weeping,
then growing numb and still,

1085
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:46,630
and then again she begs pity.
Asley citizen chief,

1086
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:50,620
please forgive me.
I will do it again.

1087
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:55,870
The wind carries her moan to me just as 
if she were moaning next to my ear.

1088
01:03:56,170 --> 01:04:01,170
The citizen chief of the gate house 
fires up his stove and does not answer.

1089
01:04:02,290 --> 01:04:03,123
This was the gate house of the camp next
to us from which workers came into our 

1090
01:04:06,941 --> 01:04:07,774
compound to lay water pipes into repair.
The old ramshackle seminary building 

1091
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:13,743
cross for me beyond the artfully 
intertwined many stranded barbed wire 

1092
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:18,604
barricade and two steps away from the 
gate house beneath the bright lantern 

1093
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:27,630
stood the punished girl head hanging the
wind tugging at her gray work skirt,

1094
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:33,970
her feet growing numb from the cold,
a thin scarf over her head.

1095
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:35,643
It had been warm during the day when 
they had been digging a ditch on our 

1096
01:04:38,051 --> 01:04:43,051
territory and another girl slipping down
into a ravine had crawled her way to the

1097
01:04:44,141 --> 01:04:44,974
Vladi Keno highway and escaped.
The guard had bungled and Moscow city 

1098
01:04:49,091 --> 01:04:51,760
buses ran right along the highway.
When they call it on,

1099
01:04:51,761 --> 01:04:55,360
it was too late to catch her and they 
raised the alarm.

1100
01:04:55,990 --> 01:05:00,990
Amine dark major arrived and shouted 
that if they failed to catch the girl,

1101
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:06,460
the entire camp would be deprived visits
and parcels for a whole month because of

1102
01:05:06,461 --> 01:05:07,294
her escape.
And the woman brigadiers went into a 

1103
01:05:10,541 --> 01:05:11,374
rage and they were all shouting.
One of them in particular who kept 

1104
01:05:14,141 --> 01:05:16,900
viciously rolling her eyes.
Oh,

1105
01:05:16,901 --> 01:05:18,280
I,
they capture the bitch.

1106
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:21,130
I hope they take scissors and clip,
clip,

1107
01:05:21,131 --> 01:05:21,964
clip,
take off all her hair in front of the 

1108
01:05:23,561 --> 01:05:26,860
lineup.
This wasn't something she had thought up

1109
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,753
herself.
This was the way they punished women in 

1110
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:30,124
the ghoulag.
But the girl who was now standing 

1111
01:05:32,501 --> 01:05:36,460
outside the gate house in the cold had 
sighed and said instead,

1112
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:41,530
at least she can have a good time out in
freedom for all of us.

1113
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:46,270
The jailer overheard what she had said 
and she was now being punished.

1114
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,820
Everyone else had been taken off to the 
camp,

1115
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:49,863
but she had been set outside there to 
stand at attention in front of the gate 

1116
01:05:53,871 --> 01:05:54,430
house.

1117
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:57,970
This had been at 6:00 PM and now it was 
11:00 PM

1118
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:01,330
she tried to shift from one foot to 
another,

1119
01:06:01,331 --> 01:06:03,100
but the guards stuck out his head and 
shouted,

1120
01:06:03,101 --> 01:06:06,910
stand at attention,
whore or else it will be worse for you,

1121
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:10,990
and now she was not moving.
Only weeping.

1122
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:13,600
Forgive me,
citizen chief,

1123
01:06:13,601 --> 01:06:17,290
let me into the camp.
I won't do it anymore,

1124
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:22,690
but even in the camp,
no one was about to say to her,

1125
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:24,070
all right,
idiot,

1126
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,513
come on in.
The reason they were keeping her out 

1127
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:28,684
there for so long with it,
the next day was Sunday and she would 

1128
01:06:31,511 --> 01:06:35,470
not be needed for work.
Such a straw,

1129
01:06:35,471 --> 01:06:36,910
blonde,
naive,

1130
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,313
uneducated slip of a girl.
She'd been imprisoned for some spool of 

1131
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:45,670
thread,
but a dangerous thought.

1132
01:06:45,671 --> 01:06:46,504
You express their little sister.
They want to teach you a lesson for the 

1133
01:06:49,301 --> 01:06:52,180
rest of your life.
Fire,

1134
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:58,350
fire.
We fought the war and we looked into the

1135
01:06:58,571 --> 01:07:01,360
bonfires to see what kind of victory it 
would be.

1136
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:06,130
The wind wafted a glowing husk from the 
bonfire

1137
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:11,570
to that flame and new girl.
I promise the whole wide world will read

1138
01:07:11,571 --> 01:07:12,404
about you.

1139
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:15,423
Okay.

1140
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:18,260
This is from John Milton from paradise 
lost

1141
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:22,853
for wince,
but from the author of all ill could 

1142
01:07:27,481 --> 01:07:31,800
spring so deep,
a malice to confound the race of mankind

1143
01:07:31,801 --> 01:07:36,801
in one route and earth with hell to 
mingle and involve done all to spite the

1144
01:07:38,071 --> 01:07:43,071
great creator.
I shall despair.

1145
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:46,610
Yeah,

1146
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:48,830
there is no creature loves me and if I 
die,

1147
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:50,690
no soul will pity me,
nay.

1148
01:07:50,691 --> 01:07:53,690
Wherefore should day since that I myself
find it in myself,

1149
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:58,440
no pity to myself.
That's Shakespeare

1150
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:01,983
soldier knits and describes his 
reactions and actions of staunch 

1151
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,163
Communist Party members imprisoned and 
devoured by the system and they support 

1152
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:13,451
it and produced frequently.
The camp system vacuumed people up.

1153
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:15,423
Really any concern whatsoever for the 
niceties of individual guilt or 

1154
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,313
innocence.
As far as Stellan and his henchmen were 

1155
01:08:23,721 --> 01:08:24,554
concerned.
There was probably something that you 

1156
01:08:25,921 --> 01:08:26,754
were guilty about at some point in your 
past and there were no shortage of 

1157
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:32,750
people to inform on you regardless of 
whether you had done anything.

1158
01:08:32,751 --> 01:08:36,080
So one of the things that used to happen
in the collective apartment buildings of

1159
01:08:36,081 --> 01:08:39,620
which there were nowhere near enough of,
so multiple families would end up living

1160
01:08:39,621 --> 01:08:42,020
in the same tiny apartment,
uh,

1161
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:46,310
was that if you could inform on someone 
down the hall who,

1162
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:47,443
you know,
maybe refused to return the quarter cup 

1163
01:08:49,341 --> 01:08:51,530
of salt you had lent them or something 
like that.

1164
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:52,513
If you would inform on them and their 
family would be carted away to the 

1165
01:08:55,371 --> 01:08:58,460
concentration camp system,
then you got to have their apartment.

1166
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:02,210
And so in East Germany at the height of 
the Soviet system,

1167
01:09:02,211 --> 01:09:03,044
one out of three people,
one out of every three people was a 

1168
01:09:04,821 --> 01:09:08,090
government informer.
And so that meant if you had a family of

1169
01:09:08,091 --> 01:09:10,670
six people,
there were two people in every room that

1170
01:09:10,671 --> 01:09:11,504
you were ever in who are ready to say to
the authorities anything you ever had 

1171
01:09:14,991 --> 01:09:15,824
the temerity to speak and perhaps to 
tell them all sorts of things that you 

1172
01:09:18,681 --> 01:09:22,190
didn't even do because there was a 
requirement if you are in former,

1173
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:25,820
to ensure that you had something to say 
every time you came into inform.

1174
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:30,253
Well,
it didn't matter if you were a devout 

1175
01:09:31,191 --> 01:09:32,024
communist,
because from time to time your door 

1176
01:09:33,951 --> 01:09:34,784
would be kicked down at 3:00 AM in the 
morning and people would come in with 

1177
01:09:36,591 --> 01:09:37,424
Jack boots and get you dressed as 
rapidly as they possibly could and take 

1178
01:09:40,461 --> 01:09:42,920
you away when you were still half awake 
to the,

1179
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:43,873
to the prison in the middle of the city 
and strip you of your clothes and give 

1180
01:09:46,431 --> 01:09:49,700
you things that didn't fit and shave 
your head and take you off to a camp and

1181
01:09:49,701 --> 01:09:51,380
you'd never get to see your family 
again.

1182
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:52,513
And that happened to millions of people.
And it happened to staunch communists 

1183
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:58,820
just like it happened to people who in 
principle,

1184
01:09:58,821 --> 01:09:59,654
we're opposed to the system.
And Solzhenitsyn thought that the 

1185
01:10:01,641 --> 01:10:04,880
staunch communist party members who were
thrown into the camps had the worst time

1186
01:10:04,881 --> 01:10:05,714
of edit of everyone because the people 
who'd already decided that the system 

1187
01:10:08,961 --> 01:10:11,120
was corrupt weren't really surprised 
when it happened,

1188
01:10:11,121 --> 01:10:12,380
even though it was still terrible.

1189
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:15,680
But the Communist Party members had 
given their whole life to the system and

1190
01:10:15,681 --> 01:10:17,540
then they were picked up just like 
everyone else.

1191
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:20,990
And he had a very hard time with them 
when they came to prison because most of

1192
01:10:20,991 --> 01:10:24,290
them assumed that a terrible mistake had
been made.

1193
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:26,150
And that if they just wrote the right 
people,

1194
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:29,180
and con contacted their former friends 
who would know,

1195
01:10:29,181 --> 01:10:30,620
by the way,
have nothing to do with them,

1196
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:33,890
that the error would be rectified in the
soon would be released.

1197
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:34,753
So they also assumed that everyone else 
in the camps was completely guilty and 

1198
01:10:38,211 --> 01:10:39,044
was there for good reason,
because otherwise the beloved party 

1199
01:10:40,911 --> 01:10:41,744
wouldn't have put them there.
But for some reason they had been in 

1200
01:10:43,761 --> 01:10:47,560
prison because they were innocent 
despite the fact that they were innocent

1201
01:10:47,561 --> 01:10:48,394
and soldiers [inaudible] and his friends
used to play a game with people like 

1202
01:10:51,441 --> 01:10:52,274
that because he didn't exactly know how 
to treat them because on the one hand 

1203
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:56,030
they were victims,
certainly.

1204
01:10:56,030 --> 01:10:57,230
And um,
but on the other hand,

1205
01:10:57,231 --> 01:10:58,064
they were part of the system that had 
perpetrated precisely the horrors that 

1206
01:11:00,861 --> 01:11:01,694
were visited on them.
So when they first came in and were 

1207
01:11:03,831 --> 01:11:08,660
still chalked full of communist Dogma 
and totalitarian thought and judgemental

1208
01:11:08,661 --> 01:11:09,494
in every possible way,
him and his friends would have fun 

1209
01:11:11,331 --> 01:11:12,164
pointing out all the shortages and 
catastrophes of the Soviet system and 

1210
01:11:15,241 --> 01:11:20,241
then let them run through their 
algorithmic ideology and until the point

1211
01:11:20,251 --> 01:11:21,084
of absurdity and then really not spend 
much time communicating with them until 

1212
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,013
they broke down and decided that things 
weren't so good for them or everybody 

1213
01:11:29,131 --> 01:11:29,964
else.
And more or less entered the common run 

1214
01:11:32,071 --> 01:11:37,071
of humanity once again
to say that things were hard for them is

1215
01:11:39,661 --> 01:11:43,110
to say almost nothing.
They were incapable of assimilating such

1216
01:11:43,111 --> 01:11:44,940
a blow,
such a downfall,

1217
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:50,480
and from their own people to from their 
only dear party and from all appearances

1218
01:11:50,671 --> 01:11:52,500
for nothing at all.
After all,

1219
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,920
they'd been guilty of nothing.
As far as the party was concerned,

1220
01:11:56,850 --> 01:12:01,850
nothing at all.
It was painful for them to such a degree

1221
01:12:02,161 --> 01:12:06,270
that it was considered taboo among them 
and comradely task.

1222
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:07,193
What were you in prison for?
The only squeamish generation of 

1223
01:12:09,781 --> 01:12:12,210
prisoners.
The rest of us with tongues hanging out.

1224
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,193
Couldn't wait to tell the story to every
chance newcomer we met and to the whole 

1225
01:12:16,861 --> 01:12:19,560
cell as if it were an anecdote.

1226
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:21,140
Okay.

1227
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:24,250
Here is the sort of people they were 
Olga sleazy,

1228
01:12:24,251 --> 01:12:25,084
Oseberg's husband had already been 
arrested and they had come to carry out 

1229
01:12:28,601 --> 01:12:29,434
a search and arrest her too.
The search lasted for hours and she 

1230
01:12:33,341 --> 01:12:34,174
spent those remaining four hours sorting
out the minutes of the congress of 

1231
01:12:38,321 --> 01:12:41,260
Staccato vites of the bristle and brush 
industry,

1232
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,560
of which she had been secretary until 
the previous day.

1233
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:45,813
The incomplete state of the minute 
troubled her more than her children who 

1234
01:12:50,351 --> 01:12:51,184
she was now leaving forever.
Even the interrogator conducting the 

1235
01:12:53,711 --> 01:12:57,280
search could not resist telling her,
come on now,

1236
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:03,040
say farewell to your children.
Here's the sort of people they were

1237
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:05,493
a letter from her 15 year old daughter 
came to yell is a veta set cova and the 

1238
01:13:10,871 --> 01:13:14,560
cows and prison for long term prisoners.
Mama,

1239
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:15,730
tell me,
write to me.

1240
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:20,500
Are you guilty or not?
I hope you weren't guilty because then I

1241
01:13:20,501 --> 01:13:21,334
won't join the Komsomol.
So that was the Soviet youth 

1242
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:25,203
organization.
I won't join the Komsomol and I won't 

1243
01:13:27,461 --> 01:13:30,310
forgive them because of you.
But if you are guilty,

1244
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:33,130
I won't write you any more and I will 
hate you.

1245
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:36,793
And the mother was stricken by remorse 
in her damp grave like cell with it's 

1246
01:13:40,611 --> 01:13:41,444
dim little lamp.
How could her daughter live without the 

1247
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:44,813
[inaudible]?

1248
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,630
How could she be permitted to hate 
Soviet power?

1249
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:51,360
Better that she should hate me.
And she wrote,

1250
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:54,270
I am guilty.
Enter the Komsomol.

1251
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:56,273
How could it be anything but hard?
It was more than the human heart could 

1252
01:13:59,251 --> 01:14:04,251
bear to fall beneath the beloved acts 
and then have to justify its wisdom.

1253
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,830
But that is the price a man pays for.
Interesting.

1254
01:14:07,831 --> 01:14:12,190
His God given sole to human dogma.
Even today,

1255
01:14:12,191 --> 01:14:17,191
any orthodox communist will affirm that 
set Cova acted correctly even today.

1256
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:19,593
They cannot be convinced that it is.
This is precisely the perversion of 

1257
01:14:23,441 --> 01:14:28,000
small forces that the mother perverted 
her daughter and harmed her soul.

1258
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:29,013
Here's the sort of people they were yt 
gave sincere testimony against her 

1259
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:35,080
husband,
anything to aid the party.

1260
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:37,383
Oh,
how one could pity them if at least now 

1261
01:14:40,071 --> 01:14:43,570
they had come to comprehend their former
wretchedness.

1262
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:44,523
This whole chapter could have been 
written quite differently if today they 

1263
01:14:46,811 --> 01:14:49,240
had at least forsaken their earlier 
views,

1264
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:53,410
but it happened the way Marea Daniel and
had dreamed it would.

1265
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:55,323
If I leave here someday,
I'm going to live as if nothing had 

1266
01:14:58,871 --> 01:15:03,010
taken place.
Loyalty in our view,

1267
01:15:03,011 --> 01:15:03,844
it is just plain pigheadedness.
These devote to the theory of 

1268
01:15:07,751 --> 01:15:11,650
development,
construed loyalty to that development to

1269
01:15:11,651 --> 01:15:14,560
mean renunciation of any personal 
development whatsoever.

1270
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,190
As Nikolai Adamovich villain,
chuck said,

1271
01:15:18,191 --> 01:15:23,191
after serving 17 years,
we believed in the party and we were not

1272
01:15:24,101 --> 01:15:28,690
mistaken.
Is this loyalty or pigheadedness?

1273
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:29,883
It was not for show and not out of 
hypocrisy that they argued in the cells 

1274
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:34,840
in defense of all the government's 
actions.

1275
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:35,793
They needed idiot logical arguments in 
order in order to hold onto a sense of 

1276
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:43,450
their own rightness.
Otherwise insanity.

1277
01:15:43,451 --> 01:15:46,870
It was not far off.
I'm going to tell you a story.

1278
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:52,370
It was a story in genesis.
It's the last story in genesis.

1279
01:15:52,371 --> 01:15:54,620
It's called the Tower of Babel.
It's a store,

1280
01:15:54,621 --> 01:15:55,454
very story,
short story and it occurs after the 

1281
01:15:57,951 --> 01:16:02,951
story of Noah and the flood
flood stories by the way,

1282
01:16:03,381 --> 01:16:04,214
or

1283
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:05,823
universally distributed except among 
desert dwellers who have no experience 

1284
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:10,983
on which to hang the story.
And Murcia Eliana who wrote a great 

1285
01:16:14,381 --> 01:16:16,960
series of books called the history of 
religious ideas,

1286
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:21,120
documented the,
the uh,

1287
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:23,610
the central narrative structure of flood
stories.

1288
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:29,260
And so what happens is that there's a 
human settlement and it's washed away by

1289
01:16:29,581 --> 01:16:32,580
a flood.
And the flood is generally envisioned as

1290
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:37,320
a consequence of God's judgment.
And so that the,

1291
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,333
if you take the flood stories that are 
distributed worldwide and you boil them 

1292
01:16:40,951 --> 01:16:43,770
down to pull out their architect,
archetypal substructure,

1293
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,130
you'll find that there are fundamentally
two reasons that a flood,

1294
01:16:47,131 --> 01:16:48,570
oh,
curves and Elliot,

1295
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:51,690
it says that it's the tendency of things
to fall apart,

1296
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:55,740
combined with the proclivity of human 
beings to sin.

1297
01:16:56,370 --> 01:16:58,500
And so,
so it means something.

1298
01:16:58,501 --> 01:16:59,760
This means something.
It's so,

1299
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:01,530
it means that

1300
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:06,220
everything is subject to entropic decay,
right?

1301
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:09,040
Things fall apart of their own accord 
across time.

1302
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:11,300
That's why you have to always fix 
things.

1303
01:17:11,330 --> 01:17:13,880
So if it's complicated,
it has to be maintained.

1304
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:15,283
And so you can think about that in 
relationship to say New Orleans before 

1305
01:17:18,321 --> 01:17:20,180
the hurricane because people say,
well,

1306
01:17:20,181 --> 01:17:24,620
the hurricane caused a flood that 
destroyed much of New Orleans,

1307
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:28,850
and so that's an act of God.
That's one way of looking at it,

1308
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,940
right?
It's a random natural event.

1309
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:34,280
But then you think,
well,

1310
01:17:34,281 --> 01:17:37,250
wait a minute.
The Dutch,

1311
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:39,950
their country's mostly underwater,
right?

1312
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:40,784
So they have these huge dykes to keep 
the sea back and they build the dike so 

1313
01:17:44,091 --> 01:17:44,924
that only one storm every 10,000 years 
will be of sufficient magnitude to 

1314
01:17:49,851 --> 01:17:53,420
partially breach the dikes.
That's their engineering tolerance level

1315
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:58,450
one storm in every 10,000 years.
The US Army Corps of Engineers knew that

1316
01:17:59,181 --> 01:18:03,860
the dykes in New Orleans were built to 
withstand one storm every hundred years,

1317
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:05,480
the biggest storm every hundred years.

1318
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:06,583
And people knew that they weren't built 
to proper tolerance and much of the 

1319
01:18:10,041 --> 01:18:15,041
money that was hypothetically supposed 
to be diverted or or,

1320
01:18:15,411 --> 01:18:16,244
or an assigned to the rebuilding and 
maintenance of the dikes disappeared 

1321
01:18:20,421 --> 01:18:21,254
because of corruption in New Orleans,
which is in one of the most corrupt 

1322
01:18:24,051 --> 01:18:26,840
states in the United States.
And so you might say,

1323
01:18:26,841 --> 01:18:30,410
well,
why did the flood destroyed New Orleans?

1324
01:18:30,411 --> 01:18:31,670
And one answer is,
well,

1325
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:34,280
it was a hurricane.
And the other answer is no,

1326
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:35,653
it was corrupt officials who weren't 
paying attention to what they were 

1327
01:18:38,511 --> 01:18:41,450
supposed to be paying attention to.
And the flood came.

1328
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:44,960
And that's the meaning of the stories 
because of the sins of men,

1329
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:45,973
so to speak,
which is the capacity of people to turn 

1330
01:18:47,841 --> 01:18:48,674
a blind eye to their responsibilities 
when they know perfectly well that 

1331
01:18:51,141 --> 01:18:51,974
something needs to be done.
And so if you don't do what needs to be 

1332
01:18:54,591 --> 01:18:58,880
done and something comes along to wipe 
you out and it's perfectly reasonable to

1333
01:18:58,881 --> 01:19:03,881
view that as a judgment on your refusal 
to do what you knew to be right.

1334
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:06,253
So that's the flood story.
And then the tower of Babel is a very 

1335
01:19:09,231 --> 01:19:10,220
interesting story.
It's very,

1336
01:19:10,221 --> 01:19:11,054
very short.
And what happens is that it just starts 

1337
01:19:14,151 --> 01:19:16,250
pretty much abruptly after the flood 
story ends.

1338
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:17,084
And it's,
it's a story about the decision that 

1339
01:19:19,431 --> 01:19:22,010
human beings take to build a mighty 
building like a huge,

1340
01:19:22,011 --> 01:19:26,960
huge edifice that would reach all the 
way up to the heavens to supplant God,

1341
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:30,890
roughly speaking.
And so what happens is that the building

1342
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:33,350
is built higher and higher and higher 
and higher.

1343
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,393
And God gets annoyed about this and
divides everyone who's building the 

1344
01:19:38,811 --> 01:19:42,230
building into small groups who speak 
different languages,

1345
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:45,980
who then disperse in the construction 
project comes to a halt.

1346
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:48,680
Now,
it's a very strange story,

1347
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:51,020
but here's one way of thinking about it.

1348
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:00,100
Larger,
you build a system,

1349
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:04,810
the more there is a proclivity to 
worship it as if it's everything.

1350
01:20:05,290 --> 01:20:06,123
That's the story of the geology.
Let's you want to build a comprehensive 

1351
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:12,930
utopian system that supplants anything 
transcended.

1352
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:14,730
You want to build it as large as 
possible.

1353
01:20:14,731 --> 01:20:17,580
So when it companies encompasses 
everyone,

1354
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:19,830
well,
what happens as it grows?

1355
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:21,840
Well,
it incorporates more and more people,

1356
01:20:21,841 --> 01:20:25,500
but the people within it become more and
more different from one another.

1357
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:29,730
And so essentially they start speaking 
different languages.

1358
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:30,863
And so the entire project of raising 
this massive edifice to supplant 

1359
01:20:33,841 --> 01:20:38,841
everything disperses into chaos and 
comes to a halt.

1360
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:40,590
Okay,
so that's one story.

1361
01:20:40,591 --> 01:20:44,250
So here's another story.
This is a story that John Milton wrote.

1362
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:48,330
John Milton wrote paradise lost,
which is one of the prime,

1363
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:50,250
okay.

1364
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:54,450
Literary masterpieces of the last

1365
01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:56,960
500 years.
Now,

1366
01:20:56,990 --> 01:21:01,990
here's what Milton Dick Milton said.
He was trying to justify the ways of God

1367
01:21:02,601 --> 01:21:05,000
to man.
That was his purpose.

1368
01:21:05,001 --> 01:21:07,730
And so what he was trying to do was take
a look at the world,

1369
01:21:07,731 --> 01:21:08,564
the way it's constituted with all its 
suffering and malevolence and 

1370
01:21:10,581 --> 01:21:11,414
corruption,
and to make a case why it was still 

1371
01:21:14,391 --> 01:21:17,210
acceptable.
And so he did the first,

1372
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:18,583
what you might think about a 
psychoanalytic study of malevolence and 

1373
01:21:20,811 --> 01:21:21,644
evil.
So around the corpus of biblical 

1374
01:21:25,641 --> 01:21:28,640
writings,
there is an idea of heaven and hell.

1375
01:21:28,670 --> 01:21:31,820
And they're not referred too much within
the corpus of biblical writings,

1376
01:21:31,821 --> 01:21:36,200
but there are what you might describe as
legends that have compiled around them.

1377
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:37,423
So their,
their stories that never became 

1378
01:21:39,231 --> 01:21:41,030
canonical.
And those are stories,

1379
01:21:41,031 --> 01:21:43,820
for example,
of the idea that God's highest angel,

1380
01:21:43,821 --> 01:21:45,530
who was Satan,
Lucifer,

1381
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,780
the bringer of light,
the spirit of rationality,

1382
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:48,913
fomented rebellion against God and 
Heaven and was passed into hell as a 

1383
01:21:51,441 --> 01:21:52,274
consequence.

1384
01:21:53,030 --> 01:21:54,410
And so there's this idea,
you,

1385
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:57,080
Milton wrote this before,
the rise of the nation states,

1386
01:21:57,081 --> 01:21:57,914
for example.
And there's this idea that there's this 

1387
01:22:00,171 --> 01:22:01,004
idea that there's this tension between 
the political and ideological and 

1388
01:22:07,221 --> 01:22:08,054
rational constructions of the rational 
mind and the sort of transcendent 

1389
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:15,710
mythology that guides human 
organization.

1390
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:21,100
And that Satan as God's highest as the 
highest angel in God's heavenly kingdom,

1391
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:23,143
is a personification of the tendency of 
the rational mind to produce 

1392
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:29,720
totalitarian systems and then to fall in
love with them.

1393
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:30,883
So to produce a system that encompasses 
everything like the tower of Babel so 

1394
01:22:34,101 --> 01:22:37,460
that nothing outside the system is 
allowed to exist.

1395
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:38,773
While Milton's intuition,
because he collected the stories about 

1396
01:22:41,001 --> 01:22:41,834
Satanic rebellion that had been 
accumulating across centuries from far 

1397
01:22:44,301 --> 01:22:48,170
before Christianity was even,
was even constituted,

1398
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:53,560
turned this into a great poetic drama.
And his hypothesis was that the,

1399
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:55,033
the element of the psyche,
let's say the spiritual element of the 

1400
01:22:57,411 --> 01:22:58,244
psyche that characterize the rational 
mind would by its proclivity to produce 

1401
01:23:02,841 --> 01:23:06,880
these totalizing systems and op itself 
into hell.

1402
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:08,493
And so you could think about it as a 
prophetic visualization of what was 

1403
01:23:12,611 --> 01:23:13,444
going to come down the centuries after 
Milton wrote because the poet's get 

1404
01:23:19,031 --> 01:23:21,580
there before the philosophers,
the artists get there.

1405
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:25,270
Maybe before the poets and philosophers 
follow in their wake.

1406
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:26,313
The poets are the people who have the 
visions of what's coming farthest down 

1407
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:32,290
the road.
So this is from Milton.

1408
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:38,350
This is describing Satan after he's cast
into hell because of his rebellion,

1409
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:39,513
his totalitarian,
the consequence of his totalitarian 

1410
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:43,564
rationalism.
For now the thought both of lost 

1411
01:23:45,341 --> 01:23:48,520
happiness and lasting pain torments him 
round.

1412
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:49,563
He throws his baleful eyes that 
witnessed huge affliction and dismay 

1413
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:57,610
mixed with obdurate pride in steadfast 
hate as once at once,

1414
01:23:57,790 --> 01:24:01,300
as far as angels can.
He views the dismal situation,

1415
01:24:01,301 --> 01:24:02,770
waste and wild,
a dungeon,

1416
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:06,520
horrible on all sides,
round as one great furnace.

1417
01:24:06,521 --> 01:24:11,230
Flamed yet from those flames,
no light but rather dark lists.

1418
01:24:11,231 --> 01:24:14,830
Darkness,
visible served only to discover sites of

1419
01:24:14,831 --> 01:24:15,664
whoa regions of sorrow.
Doleful shades where peace and rest can 

1420
01:24:19,661 --> 01:24:22,030
never dwell.
Hope never comes.

1421
01:24:22,031 --> 01:24:22,864
That comes to all but torture without 
end still urges and a fiery deluge fed 

1422
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,140
with ever burning sulfur unconsumed such
place.

1423
01:24:32,141 --> 01:24:35,500
Eternal Justice had prepared for those 
rebellious here,

1424
01:24:35,501 --> 01:24:36,334
their prison ordained in utter darkness 
and their portion set as far removed 

1425
01:24:40,601 --> 01:24:45,550
from God and light of Heaven as from the
center thrice to the utmost pole.

1426
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:52,170
It's an existentialist claim or maybe 
it's the existentialist plate

1427
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:55,783
that the

1428
01:24:57,610 --> 01:24:58,443
conditions of human life are such that 
suffering is an integral part of 

1429
01:25:01,991 --> 01:25:02,824
existence.
Now it's an important thing to 

1430
01:25:04,871 --> 01:25:09,871
understand.
It's also a viewpoint shared by the bulk

1431
01:25:10,031 --> 01:25:12,040
of the great religious systems of the 
world.

1432
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,290
Life is suffering.
Why?

1433
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:16,293
Well,
one reason is because of society's 

1434
01:25:20,051 --> 01:25:21,940
arbitrary judgment,
right?

1435
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:23,163
Every single one of us has
traits and features and and quirks and 

1436
01:25:30,761 --> 01:25:31,594
idiosyncrasies that are far from ideal 
and that are judged by the standards of 

1437
01:25:38,981 --> 01:25:39,814
society as insufficient.
And so you suffer because of your 

1438
01:25:44,321 --> 01:25:45,154
imperfect insufficiency in the eyes of 
others and you can certainly make the 

1439
01:25:48,491 --> 01:25:52,600
claim that fairly frequently.
That's arbitrary.

1440
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:53,553
And so that's the claim that society is 
tyrannical and judgmental and it needs 

1441
01:25:57,371 --> 01:26:02,371
to be constantly week constituted so 
that the tyrannical element doesn't take

1442
01:26:05,241 --> 01:26:06,074
full control and fair enough,
you have to stay awake so that that 

1443
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:09,374
doesn't happen.
But the thing is it doesn't matter what 

1444
01:26:12,891 --> 01:26:13,724
society it is,
although they vary in the degree of 

1445
01:26:15,561 --> 01:26:16,394
their tyranny.

1446
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:17,233
The mere fact that your group together 
with other people and have to come up 

1447
01:26:19,821 --> 01:26:20,654
with a common value structure in order 
to live together means that many of the 

1448
01:26:23,631 --> 01:26:26,480
things that characterize you are going 
to be suboptimal.

1449
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:27,643
And so the price you pay for social 
being is that much of you is deemed 

1450
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:34,730
insufficient.
Now,

1451
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:35,564
hopefully there are various ways that 
you can be within the society that's 

1452
01:26:37,781 --> 01:26:42,781
sufficiently diverse so that you can 
find a place where what's good about you

1453
01:26:42,861 --> 01:26:43,694
in the eyes of others and perhaps in 
your own eyes can flourish of its own 

1454
01:26:47,421 --> 01:26:50,150
accord because you don't have to be good
at everything.

1455
01:26:50,151 --> 01:26:52,820
If you can be good at at one thing well 
enough,

1456
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:57,200
that might allow you your niche and 
hopefully a healthy society allow us for

1457
01:26:57,220 --> 01:26:58,053
that.
Certainly societies can become so 

1458
01:26:59,121 --> 01:27:00,380
tyrannical,
but they don't.

1459
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:01,933
So you can lay one source of human 
suffering out the feet of tyrannical 

1460
01:27:04,851 --> 01:27:05,690
social structures.

1461
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:06,523
But the other element of it clearly is 
the mere fact of the arbitrary ness of 

1462
01:27:12,291 --> 01:27:13,124
the natural world.
You have a lifespan that's going to be 

1463
01:27:15,591 --> 01:27:16,424
counted in the number of decades that 
you can count on two hands and that has 

1464
01:27:20,841 --> 01:27:24,080
nothing to do technically with the 
tyranny of the social structure.

1465
01:27:24,081 --> 01:27:24,914
Now you could say,
if we got our act together more 

1466
01:27:26,571 --> 01:27:27,404
completely,
perhaps you could live longer and fair 

1467
01:27:28,851 --> 01:27:29,684
enough,
but the fact of the limits of your 

1468
01:27:31,011 --> 01:27:34,670
lifespan and the suffering that's 
necessarily a consequence of that,

1469
01:27:34,671 --> 01:27:39,110
the death of your parents and the death 
of most people that you will know before

1470
01:27:39,111 --> 01:27:44,111
you means that that part of suffering is
an integral part of existence itself.

1471
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:49,820
And so that can't be laid at his feet of
an insufficient social structure,

1472
01:27:49,821 --> 01:27:52,280
except in so far as it's tyrannical and 
blind.

1473
01:27:52,490 --> 01:27:55,250
It's a condition of existence.
And then by the same token,

1474
01:27:55,251 --> 01:27:56,084
you have your own responsibility for 
some of your unnecessary suffering 

1475
01:27:59,931 --> 01:28:00,764
because there's things you could be 
doing to make your life better and to 

1476
01:28:03,621 --> 01:28:04,454
make life better for other people that 
you know perfectly well that you're not 

1477
01:28:07,071 --> 01:28:07,850
doing.

1478
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:08,683
And so if you stopped doing all the 
unnecessary things that make your life 

1479
01:28:12,441 --> 01:28:13,274
bad,
then it would improve to some degree 

1480
01:28:14,661 --> 01:28:18,530
that is not ready computable because you
don't know how far you could push that.

1481
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:19,663
So there's three reasons why you suffer 
and one is well look at you and the way 

1482
01:28:23,571 --> 01:28:25,070
you're built.
It's inevitable.

1483
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:27,650
There's not very much of you and there's
a lot of everything else.

1484
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:29,053
And so you just don't last that long and
you're fragile across multiple domains 

1485
01:28:32,691 --> 01:28:33,524
and then you're harshly treated by 
society and there is no doubt about 

1486
01:28:35,691 --> 01:28:37,910
that.
And then there's responsibility that can

1487
01:28:37,911 --> 01:28:38,744
be laid at your own feet.
While the existential take on that in 

1488
01:28:41,571 --> 01:28:44,480
the thing that all these diverse people 
that we've been talking about,

1489
01:28:44,481 --> 01:28:48,170
including Viktor Frankl,
including Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn as well

1490
01:28:48,171 --> 01:28:50,220
as um,
uh,

1491
01:28:50,270 --> 01:28:51,103
Kierkegaard,
Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and the people 

1492
01:28:52,551 --> 01:28:53,384
that I've already talked to you about is
that the proper pathway through that is 

1493
01:28:57,801 --> 01:29:02,490
to adopt the mode of
authentic being.

1494
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:04,463
And that is something like refusing to 
participate in the lie in deception and 

1495
01:29:09,991 --> 01:29:14,160
the lie to Orient your speech as much as
you can towards the truth.

1496
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:16,073
And to take responsibility for your own 
life and perhaps also for the lives of 

1497
01:29:18,991 --> 01:29:19,824
other people.
And there's something about that that's 

1498
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:22,733
meaningful and responsible and noble,
but also serves to mitigate the very 

1499
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:28,404
suffering that produces,
say that nihilism or the flee into the 

1500
01:29:31,861 --> 01:29:33,870
arms of fleet or,
or the,

1501
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:37,680
or the escape into the arms of 
totalitarians to begin with.

1502
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:39,383
You need something to shelter you 
against your own vulnerability and you 

1503
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:44,844
can adopt a comprehensive description of
reality that's formulated for you by 

1504
01:29:48,631 --> 01:29:49,464
someone else that neatly divides the 
world into those who are innocent and 

1505
01:29:53,131 --> 01:29:53,964
perhaps innocent victims and those who 
are guilty and perhaps the perpetrators 

1506
01:29:57,001 --> 01:29:59,550
of the suffering.
But none of that has anything to do with

1507
01:29:59,551 --> 01:29:59,850
you.

1508
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:01,890
And in addition,
it's simply not,

1509
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:03,413
it's not a reasonable way of assessing 
the world that the suffering is built 

1510
01:30:07,290 --> 01:30:10,020
in.
So that's why the AA,

1511
01:30:10,021 --> 01:30:12,540
there's an existentialist insistence 
upon that.

1512
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:13,720
So that for the Freud,
Ian's,

1513
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:16,770
the psychoanalysts,
and even for people like Carl Rogers,

1514
01:30:16,771 --> 01:30:17,604
to some degree,
if you're in a situation that's 

1515
01:30:20,941 --> 01:30:23,730
characterized by psychopathology,
if there's something wrong with you,

1516
01:30:23,731 --> 01:30:24,564
mentally,
that's a consequence of something gone 

1517
01:30:26,281 --> 01:30:27,114
wrong.
But that's not the existentialist take 

1518
01:30:28,741 --> 01:30:31,380
the existentialists take is now.
That's just how it is.

1519
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:32,543
That's just how it is.
You don't have to necessarily have done 

1520
01:30:35,341 --> 01:30:38,070
anything wrong for things to get 
completely out of control.

1521
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:42,750
It's a terrifying doctrine,
but it's not a hopeless doctrine because

1522
01:30:42,751 --> 01:30:44,760
it still says that there's a way 
forward.

1523
01:30:44,761 --> 01:30:45,594
There is a pathway forward.
Pathway forward is to adopt a mode of 

1524
01:30:48,871 --> 01:30:49,704
being that has some nobility so that you
can tolerate yourself and perhaps even 

1525
01:30:54,751 --> 01:30:55,584
have some respect for yourself as 
someone who's capable of standing up in 

1526
01:30:59,281 --> 01:31:01,980
the face of that terrible vulnerability 
and suffering.

1527
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:06,030
And that the pathway forward as far as 
the existentialists are concerned is by,

1528
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:08,820
well certainly by the avoidance of 
deceit,

1529
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:09,713
particularly in language,
but also by the adoption of 

1530
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:13,733
responsibility for the conditions of 
existence in some attempt on your part 

1531
01:31:16,741 --> 01:31:17,574
to actually rectify them.
And the thing that's so interesting 

1532
01:31:19,471 --> 01:31:22,080
about that is there were up to,
as far as I'm concerned,

1533
01:31:22,860 --> 01:31:24,690
and some of this is from clinical 
experience.

1534
01:31:24,691 --> 01:31:25,890
You know,
if you take people,

1535
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:26,903
and I've told you this,
and you expose them voluntarily to 

1536
01:31:29,161 --> 01:31:31,710
things that they are avoiding and are 
afraid of,

1537
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:32,573
you know,
that they know they need to overcome in 

1538
01:31:33,601 --> 01:31:36,060
order to meet their goals,
their self defined goals.

1539
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:37,193
If you can teach people to stand up in 
the face of the things they're afraid 

1540
01:31:39,841 --> 01:31:40,674
of,
they get stronger and you don't know 

1541
01:31:42,781 --> 01:31:43,614
what the upper limits to that are.
Because you might ask yourself like if 

1542
01:31:46,081 --> 01:31:46,914
for 10 years,
if you didn't avoid doing what you knew 

1543
01:31:49,621 --> 01:31:52,290
you needed to do by the death,
by your own definitions,

1544
01:31:52,291 --> 01:31:54,570
right within the value structure that 
you've created,

1545
01:31:54,690 --> 01:31:57,720
to the degree that you've done that,
what would you be like?

1546
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:00,220
Well,

1547
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,053
you know,
there are remarkable people who come 

1548
01:32:02,021 --> 01:32:02,854
into the world from time to time and 
there are people who do find out over 

1549
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:10,060
decades long periods what they could be 
like if they were who they were.

1550
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:11,103
If they said if they spoke their being 
forward and they get stronger and 

1551
01:32:16,301 --> 01:32:18,820
stronger and stronger and we don't know 
the limits to that.

1552
01:32:18,821 --> 01:32:21,310
We do not know the limits to that.
And so you could say,

1553
01:32:21,311 --> 01:32:21,911
well,
in part,

1554
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:22,744
perhaps the reason that you're suffering
unbearably can be left at your feet 

1555
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:28,810
because you're not everything you could 
be and you know it.

1556
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:29,973
And of course that's a terrible thing to
admit and it's a terrible thing to 

1557
01:32:32,471 --> 01:32:34,960
consider,
but there's real promise in it,

1558
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:36,250
right?
Because it means that

1559
01:32:37,870 --> 01:32:40,610
perhaps there's another way that you 
could look at the world in a number,

1560
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:42,970
another way that you could act in the 
world.

1561
01:32:42,970 --> 01:32:43,803
So what it would reflect back to you,
it'd be much better than what it 

1562
01:32:45,701 --> 01:32:49,180
reflects back to you now.
And then the second part of that is,

1563
01:32:49,181 --> 01:32:50,014
well,
imagine that many people did that 

1564
01:32:51,911 --> 01:32:54,010
because we've done a lot as human 
beings.

1565
01:32:54,011 --> 01:32:56,860
We've done a lot of remarkable things.
And I told you already,

1566
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:58,930
I think before the today,
for example,

1567
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:00,033
about 250,000 people will be lifted out 
of abject poverty and about 300,000 

1568
01:33:04,271 --> 01:33:08,440
people a attached to the electrical 
power grid or making people were lifting

1569
01:33:08,441 --> 01:33:09,274
people out of poverty collectively at a 
faster rate that's ever occurred in the 

1570
01:33:11,891 --> 01:33:12,724
history of humankind by a huge margin.
And that's been going on unbelievably 

1571
01:33:16,571 --> 01:33:21,571
quickly since the year 2000 the UN had 
planned to have poverty between 2000 and

1572
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:22,804
2015 and it was accomplished by 2013 so 
there's inequality developing in many 

1573
01:33:28,451 --> 01:33:31,300
places and you hear lots of political 
agitation about that.

1574
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:32,313
But overall the,
the tide is lifting everyone up and 

1575
01:33:35,111 --> 01:33:35,944
that's a great thing.
And we have no idea how fast we could 

1576
01:33:37,451 --> 01:33:40,960
multiply that if people got their act 
together and really aimed at it.

1577
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:42,101
Because,
you know,

1578
01:33:42,101 --> 01:33:42,934
my,
my experience is with people that were 

1579
01:33:45,101 --> 01:33:48,370
probably running at about 51% of our 
capacity.

1580
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:49,211
Something,
I mean,

1581
01:33:49,211 --> 01:33:50,044
you can think about this yourself.
I often ask undergraduates how many 

1582
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:56,440
hours a day you waste or how many hours 
a week you waste.

1583
01:33:56,860 --> 01:33:59,950
The classic answer is something like 
four to six hours a day,

1584
01:34:00,370 --> 01:34:02,080
you know,
inefficient studying,

1585
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:04,900
uh,
watching things on youtube that not only

1586
01:34:04,901 --> 01:34:05,734
do you not want to watch that you don't 
even care about that make you feel 

1587
01:34:07,781 --> 01:34:09,940
horrible about watching after you're 
done,

1588
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:13,210
that's probably four hours right there.
Now you think,

1589
01:34:13,211 --> 01:34:16,960
well that's 2025 hours a week.
It's a hundred hours a month.

1590
01:34:16,961 --> 01:34:18,910
That's two and a half full work weeks.

1591
01:34:19,090 --> 01:34:24,090
It's half a year of work weeks per year,
and if your time is worth $20 an hour,

1592
01:34:25,031 --> 01:34:25,864
which is a radical underestimate,
it's probably more like 50 if you think 

1593
01:34:28,391 --> 01:34:32,560
about it in terms of deferred wages,
if you're wasting 20 hours a week,

1594
01:34:32,650 --> 01:34:33,483
you're racing $50,000 a year and you are
doing that right now and it's because 

1595
01:34:37,841 --> 01:34:38,674
you're young wasting $50,000 a year as a
way bigger catastrophe than it would be 

1596
01:34:41,831 --> 01:34:44,500
for me to waste it because I'm not going
to last nearly as long.

1597
01:34:44,830 --> 01:34:46,750
And so if your life isn't everything,
it could be,

1598
01:34:46,751 --> 01:34:47,584
you could ask yourself,
well what would happen if you just 

1599
01:34:49,061 --> 01:34:52,300
stopped wasting the opportunities that 
are in front of you?

1600
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:55,660
You'd be who knows how much more 
efficient,

1601
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:59,330
10 times more efficient,
20 times more efficient.

1602
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:03,170
That's the burrito distribution.
You have no idea how efficient,

1603
01:35:03,171 --> 01:35:05,480
efficient people get.
It's completely,

1604
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:06,890
it's off the charts.

1605
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:09,090
Yeah.

1606
01:35:09,090 --> 01:35:09,923
Well and if we all got her act together 
collectively and stopped making things 

1607
01:35:13,261 --> 01:35:16,020
worse because that's another thing 
people do all the time.

1608
01:35:16,230 --> 01:35:19,170
Not only do they not do what they should
to make things better,

1609
01:35:19,290 --> 01:35:20,123
they actively attempt to make things 
worse because they're spiteful or 

1610
01:35:22,591 --> 01:35:23,424
resentful or arrogant or deceitful or or
homicidal or genocidal or all of those 

1611
01:35:29,101 --> 01:35:29,934
things all

1612
01:35:30,700 --> 01:35:33,760
bundled together in an absolutely 
pathological package.

1613
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:37,990
If people stopped really,
really trying just to make things worse,

1614
01:35:38,170 --> 01:35:41,080
we have no idea how much better they 
would get just because of that.

1615
01:35:41,890 --> 01:35:42,723
So there's this weird dynamic that's 
part of the existential system of ideas 

1616
01:35:46,031 --> 01:35:49,240
between human vulnerability,
social judgment,

1617
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:51,490
both of which are are,
are,

1618
01:35:51,730 --> 01:35:52,563
are major causes of suffering and the 
failure of individuals to adopt the 

1619
01:35:55,901 --> 01:35:58,810
responsibility that they know they 
should adopt.

1620
01:35:59,110 --> 01:36:02,740
And that's the thing that's interesting 
too is that like one of the,

1621
01:36:02,741 --> 01:36:06,160
another thing I've asked often asked my 
undergraduate classes is,

1622
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:07,593
you know,
there's this idea that if people have 

1623
01:36:09,191 --> 01:36:10,690
that people have a conscience

1624
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:13,700
and you know what the conscience is.
It's,

1625
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:14,803
it's this feeling or voice you have in 
your head just before you do something 

1626
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:19,873
that you know is stupid telling you that
probably you shouldn't do that stupid 

1627
01:36:23,271 --> 01:36:25,940
thing.
You don't have to listen to it strangely

1628
01:36:25,941 --> 01:36:28,730
enough,
but you go ahead and do it anyways.

1629
01:36:28,731 --> 01:36:29,564
And then of course exactly what the 
conscience told you was going to happen 

1630
01:36:32,121 --> 01:36:35,660
inevitably happen so that you'll feel 
even stupider about it than you would if

1631
01:36:35,661 --> 01:36:37,380
it happened by accident.
Because you knew,

1632
01:36:37,381 --> 01:36:39,590
you know,
I knew this was going to happen,

1633
01:36:39,770 --> 01:36:43,250
I got a warning it was going to happen 
and I went and did it anyways.

1634
01:36:43,251 --> 01:36:46,580
And the funny thing too is that that 
conscience operates within people and we

1635
01:36:46,581 --> 01:36:48,770
really don't understand what the hell 
that is.

1636
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:51,090
So you might say,
well,

1637
01:36:51,091 --> 01:36:51,924
what would happen if you abided by your 
conscience for five years or for 10 

1638
01:36:54,631 --> 01:36:57,000
years?
What sort of position might you be in?

1639
01:36:57,001 --> 01:36:57,834
What sort of family might you have,
what sort of relationship might you be 

1640
01:37:00,391 --> 01:37:01,224
able to forge?
And you can be bloody sure that a 

1641
01:37:03,091 --> 01:37:08,091
relationship that's forged on the basis 
of who you actually are is going to be a

1642
01:37:08,341 --> 01:37:09,174
lot stronger and more welcome than one 
that's forged on the basis of who you 

1643
01:37:12,151 --> 01:37:13,440
aren't.
Now,

1644
01:37:13,441 --> 01:37:14,274
of course,
that means that the person you're with 

1645
01:37:15,241 --> 01:37:16,074
has to deal with the full force of you 
in all your ability and your 

1646
01:37:19,831 --> 01:37:21,420
catastrophe.
And that's a very,

1647
01:37:21,421 --> 01:37:25,440
very difficult thing to negotiate.
But if you do negotiate it well,

1648
01:37:25,441 --> 01:37:27,090
at least you,
you have something,

1649
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:30,300
you have somewhere solid to stand and 
you have somewhere to live.

1650
01:37:30,301 --> 01:37:31,134
You have a real life and it's a great 
basis upon which to bring children into 

1651
01:37:35,341 --> 01:37:36,300
the world,
for example,

1652
01:37:36,301 --> 01:37:37,134
because you can have an actual 
relationship with them instead of 

1653
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:43,530
torturing them half to death,
which is what happens in a tremendous,

1654
01:37:44,190 --> 01:37:46,830
a tremendously large minority of cases.

1655
01:37:48,330 --> 01:37:50,100
Well,
it's more than that too because,

1656
01:37:50,101 --> 01:37:50,934
and this is what I'll close with,
and this is why I wanted to introduce 

1657
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:54,540
Solzhenitsyn's writings to you.
You see,

1658
01:37:54,810 --> 01:37:55,643
because it isn't merely that your fate 
depends on whether or not you get your 

1659
01:37:59,701 --> 01:38:00,534
act together and to what degree you 
decide that you're going to live out 

1660
01:38:03,991 --> 01:38:07,080
your own genuine being.
It isn't only your fate,

1661
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:09,810
it's the fate of everyone that you're 
networked with.

1662
01:38:10,110 --> 01:38:11,310
And so you know,
you think,

1663
01:38:11,311 --> 01:38:13,620
well,
there's 9 billion,

1664
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:14,513
7 billion people in the world.
We're going to peak at about 9 billion 

1665
01:38:16,981 --> 01:38:19,080
by the way,
and then it'll decline rapidly,

1666
01:38:19,081 --> 01:38:21,660
but 7 billion people in the world,
and who are you?

1667
01:38:21,661 --> 01:38:24,900
You're just one little dust mote among 
that 7 billion.

1668
01:38:24,901 --> 01:38:27,150
And so it really doesn't matter what you
do or don't do,

1669
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:27,984
but that's simply not the case.
It's the wrong model because you're at 

1670
01:38:31,231 --> 01:38:34,890
the center of a network,
you're a node in a network.

1671
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:35,873
Of course,
that's even more true now that we have 

1672
01:38:36,811 --> 01:38:38,120
social media.
You'll,

1673
01:38:38,121 --> 01:38:38,954
you know,
you'll know a thousand people at least 

1674
01:38:40,441 --> 01:38:41,274
over the course of your life and they'll
know a thousand people each and that 

1675
01:38:43,621 --> 01:38:47,910
puts you one person away from 1,000,002 
persons away from a billion.

1676
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:51,420
And so that's how you're connected and 
the things you do,

1677
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:56,010
they're like dropping a stone in a pond.
The ripples move outward and they affect

1678
01:38:56,011 --> 01:38:58,950
things in ways that you can't fully 
comprehend.

1679
01:38:58,951 --> 01:38:59,784
And it means that the things that you do
and that you don't do are far more 

1680
01:39:02,671 --> 01:39:07,050
important than you think.
And so if you act that way,

1681
01:39:07,051 --> 01:39:07,884
of course the terror of realizing that 
is that it actually starts to matter 

1682
01:39:10,711 --> 01:39:11,970
what you do.
And you might say,

1683
01:39:11,971 --> 01:39:14,910
well that's better than living a 
meaningless existence.

1684
01:39:14,970 --> 01:39:18,540
It's better for it to matter.
But I mean if you really ask yourself,

1685
01:39:18,541 --> 01:39:20,640
would you be so sure if you had the 
choice?

1686
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:23,490
I can live with no responsibility 
whatsoever.

1687
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:24,473
The price I pay is that nothing matters 
or I can reverse it and everything 

1688
01:39:28,321 --> 01:39:29,154
matters.
But I have to take the responsibility 

1689
01:39:31,261 --> 01:39:32,094
that's associated with that.
It's not so obvious to me that people 

1690
01:39:34,621 --> 01:39:37,440
would take the meaningful path.
No.

1691
01:39:37,441 --> 01:39:38,131
When you say,
well,

1692
01:39:38,131 --> 01:39:38,964
nihilists suffer dreadfully because 
there's no meaning in their life and 

1693
01:39:40,891 --> 01:39:41,880
they still suffer.
Yeah,

1694
01:39:41,881 --> 01:39:44,160
but the advantages,
they have no responsibility.

1695
01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:45,743
So that's the payoff.
And I actually think that's the 

1696
01:39:47,041 --> 01:39:47,851
motivation.
Say,

1697
01:39:47,851 --> 01:39:49,380
well,
I can't help being nihilistic.

1698
01:39:49,381 --> 01:39:51,300
All my belief systems have collapsed.
It's like,

1699
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:52,350
yeah,
maybe.

1700
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:53,873
Maybe you've just allowed them to 
collapse because it's a hell of a lot 

1701
01:39:55,441 --> 01:39:56,274
easier than acting them out.
And the price you pay is some 

1702
01:39:58,130 --> 01:39:58,963
meaningless suffering.
But you can always whine about that and 

1703
01:40:00,331 --> 01:40:03,720
people will feel sorry for you and you 
have the option of taking the pathway of

1704
01:40:03,721 --> 01:40:04,180
the martyr.

1705
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:06,450
So that's a pretty good deal.
All things considered,

1706
01:40:06,690 --> 01:40:07,523
especially when the,
when the alternative is to bear your 

1707
01:40:11,431 --> 01:40:14,670
burden properly and to live forthrightly
in the world.

1708
01:40:14,671 --> 01:40:15,504
Well,
what's Sojitz and figured out and so 

1709
01:40:16,801 --> 01:40:19,380
many people in the 20th century,
it's not just him,

1710
01:40:19,381 --> 01:40:24,360
even though he's the best example is 
that if you live a pathological life,

1711
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:28,500
you pathologize your society.
And if enough people do that,

1712
01:40:28,501 --> 01:40:33,120
then it's hell really,
really.

1713
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:37,120
And you can read the Gulag archipelago 
if you have the fortitude,

1714
01:40:37,140 --> 01:40:37,973
fortitude to do that,
and you'll see exactly what hell is 

1715
01:40:39,841 --> 01:40:40,674
like,
and then you can decide if that's a 

1716
01:40:41,881 --> 01:40:44,700
place you'd like to visit,
or even more importantly,

1717
01:40:44,701 --> 01:40:45,534
if it's a light,
if it's a place you'd like to visit and 

1718
01:40:47,401 --> 01:40:51,360
take all your family and friends,
because that's what happened in the 20th

1719
01:40:51,361 --> 01:40:52,194
century.

1720
01:40:57,020 --> 01:41:01,640
[inaudible].
