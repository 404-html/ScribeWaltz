1
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,800
We've discussed the big five traits,
extroversion,

2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,563
that's sensitivity to positive emotion.
Neuroticism had sensitivity to negative 

3
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:23,090
emotion,
not all negative emotions,

4
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:27,410
mostly fear anxiety and emotional pain 
seemed to load on neuroticism,

5
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,920
disgust,
which is another negative emotion.

6
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:36,330
It seems to be more associated
with conscientiousness,

7
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:41,420
particularly its orderliness aspect,
agreeableness,

8
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,943
conscientiousness and openness.
We're going to talk about agreeableness 

9
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:45,434
today.
Agreeableness is a very difficult 

10
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,650
personality dimension to understand.
I think partly because it's difficult to

11
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:52,484
dissociate from neuroticism,
Andy and as well from extroversion 

12
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,213
because agreeable people like you and so
that kind of sounds like extroversion 

13
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:02,683
and disagreeable people sound like 
they're hard to get along with and they 

14
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:06,764
sort of are,
but people who were high in neuroticism 

15
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:09,704
or hard to get along with too,
and they tend to be volatile and 

16
00:01:11,631 --> 00:01:12,464
irritable and so most of the time if 
you're engaged in a contentious issue 

17
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:17,294
with someone and emotions flare it,
it usually has more to do with trait 

18
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:23,570
neuroticism then with disagreeableness 
per se.

19
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,380
So what I'm going to do is try to 
describe to you what the agreeable trait

20
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:28,214
is on both of its dimensions and also to
lay out the pros and cons of existence 

21
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,383
on that normal distribution trait,
normal distribution at more or less 

22
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:40,360
every point.
Because I think my,

23
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,820
the way I look at it anyways,
there's a bit of all of the traits.

24
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,743
Agreeableness is the one that seems to 
come with the most market positive and 

25
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:51,260
negative aspects.
Features let's say.

26
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,123
So we don't confuse it with aspects the 
both positive and negative features at 

27
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:57,260
each point on the distribution.
It's a very complex,

28
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,180
it seems to be a very,
very complex dimension.

29
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:00,014
So I'll read you some of the questions 
from the big five aspect scale and 

30
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:03,974
that'll give you kind of a initial,
a rule of thumb estimate about whether 

31
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:09,170
or not you're agreeable or disagreeable.

32
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,270
And so here,
here are some of the questions,

33
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,223
uh,
imagine that you're answering these for 

34
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:19,250
yourself on a scale from one to five,
strongly disagree to strongly agree.

35
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,353
So the first question is,
I'm not interested in other people's 

36
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:25,274
problems.
So if you are interested in other 

37
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:30,380
people's problems,
that tilts you towards agreeableness and

38
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:34,040
I believe that's a agreeableness is 
divided into compassion and politeness,

39
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,900
which also sounded like very positive 
things,

40
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:36,734
right?
Because everyone wants to be 

41
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:40,940
compassionate to everyone,
wants to be polite and so you might say,

42
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:43,460
well,
is is that a virtue?

43
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,533
Are those virtues and with the other Ed 
being actually negative to be not 

44
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,190
compassionate,
not polite,

45
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,203
it's certainly worded that way and 
that's actually a mistake because we 

46
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:56,450
know that these traits are normally 
distributed roughly speaking,

47
00:02:56,451 --> 00:02:59,260
right,
and that that means that there has to be

48
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:00,094
positive and negative features at every 
single position on the distribution and 

49
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:06,700
sort of make the,
make the presupposition,

50
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:07,534
for example,
that being extroverted as being better 

51
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:12,790
than it being introverted or that being 
emotionally stable is necessarily better

52
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:17,050
than being neurotic,
is to make a kind of a kind of confusion

53
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:22,051
of of moral are what obligation with 
trait which trait position.

54
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,430
You have to assume that there's 
advantages and disadvantage also all the

55
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:30,820
way along or or the distribution 
wouldn't have set itself up that way.

56
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,450
Especially because these seams seem to 
be biologically instantiated traits.

57
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,060
So anyways,
um,

58
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,730
if you're interested in other people's 
problems,

59
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,950
they like to.
Ember unburden themselves to you,

60
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:44,050
you care about it.
That's a mark of compassion.

61
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:44,884
If you're more or less indifferent to 
other people's stupid problems and you 

62
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:51,520
wish they just get on with it,
then you're less compassionate,

63
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:54,810
you're harsher and more and more,
um,

64
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,100
well,
at the extreme,

65
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:00,010
more Kelis ah,
let's see.

66
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,310
Respect.
Authority.

67
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,670
That's politeness.
That's part of agreeableness.

68
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,020
I'm rarely.
Let's see,

69
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:16,050
wow.
Feel others' emotions.

70
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:22,850
Compassion.
Inquire about others' wellbeing.

71
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,713
Compassion

72
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,973
can't be bothered with others' needs.
Take advantage of others that's 

73
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:36,010
disagreeable.
Obviously.

74
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,910
Sympathize with others' feelings.
Avoid imposing my will on others.

75
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,390
Wait for others to lead the way.
Okay.

76
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:47,224
I think,
I think all of those were associated 

77
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:50,680
with trait agreeableness or 
disagreeableness.

78
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:52,510
So let's,
let's think about this for a minute.

79
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,930
So I'm going to tell you how I 
conceptualize agreeableness.

80
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,870
The first thing you want to know is that
women are more agreeable than men,

81
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,883
about half a standard deviation,
and that's approximately enough so that 

82
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,933
if you took a random mail in a random 
female out of the population and you 

83
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,610
tried to guess who was more agreeable 
and you guessed the female,

84
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:11,350
you'd be right about 60 percent of the 
time.

85
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,030
So and,
but what,

86
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,590
what,
what's interesting about that,

87
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:16,360
and this is something also to keep in 
mind,

88
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:18,730
is about normal distributions.
You know,

89
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:19,564
so imagine you have normal distribution 
so that most people are in the middle 

90
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,610
and then you have another normal 
distribution,

91
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,040
male and female,
and mostly they overlap,

92
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:32,230
but you see out here and out here,
they don't overlap at all.

93
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,580
And so even though on average men and 
women don't just don't,

94
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,433
aren't that much different in terms of 
their levels of agreeableness by the 

95
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,374
group.
If you go out and you look at the 

96
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:42,970
extremes,
they're very different.

97
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,043
So all of the most agreeable people are 
women and all of the most disagreeable 

98
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:49,220
people are men.
And the thing is,

99
00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:52,250
the extremes are often what matter 
rather than what's in the middle.

100
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,280
And so one of the ways that's reflected 
in society by the way,

101
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:56,114
is there's way more men in prison and 
the best personality predictor of being 

102
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:04,280
in prison is to be low in agreeableness.
It makes you Kelis.

103
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,631
Now you may think,
well,

104
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,820
what's the opposite of compassion and 
politeness?

105
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:12,110
And the answer to that is,
I think it's best sort of conceptualized

106
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:14,180
as a,
as a trading game.

107
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,703
So let's say that we're going to play 
repeated trading games and if you're a 

108
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:20,294
very agreeable then you're going to 
bargain harder on my behalf than you're 

109
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:24,980
going to bargain on your own behalf.

110
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,650
Whereas if you're very disagreeable,
you're going to do the reverse.

111
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:28,484
You're going to think,
I mean this trading game for me and you 

112
00:06:31,261 --> 00:06:32,780
are going to take care of your own 
interests.

113
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:34,520
Were an agreeable person,
is going to say no,

114
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:35,460
no,
at best,

115
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,180
at worst,
this has to be 50 slash 50.

116
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:40,400
But I'd like to help you every way I 
can.

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,010
Okay?
Now the credit.

118
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:42,883
Okay,
so you Kinda,

119
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,723
you kind of understand that now the 
advantage to being agreeable then is 

120
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:46,664
that you're good in teams and you're 
very much likely to give other people 

121
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,574
credit that bad.
The downside of being agreeable is that 

122
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:52,454
you're not very good at putting forward 
your own interests and so one of the 

123
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:55,964
things that predicts salary across time,
for example is agreeableness and it 

124
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:00,284
predicts it negatively and so it's part 
of the reason why women get paid less 

125
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:03,884
than men and this is something for the 
women in the class who really listened 

126
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:07,574
to because you how you get paid across 
time depends on a very large number of 

127
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:12,020
things.

128
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,853
Right?
It depends on your skills and your 

129
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:16,910
abilities and your position and your 
social network and all of that.

130
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:17,744
But the other thing it depends on is 
whether or not you actually go ask for 

131
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:20,804
money or maybe that you don't even ask 
because actually you don't ask for 

132
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:26,060
money.
You tell people that you need to be paid

133
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:29,540
more or something they don't like will 
happen and I don't mean as a threat.

134
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,733
I mean that you have to be willing when 
you're negotiating to have an 

135
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:36,320
alternative,
you go talk to your boss who isn't going

136
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:38,450
to give you money because everyone wants
money,

137
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,830
right?
It's a competitive game.

138
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,873
You're going to have to be.
You're going to have to go there and 

139
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:42,770
say,
look,

140
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,590
here's what I do.
Here's why it's useful.

141
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,490
Here's why you have to give me more 
money and this is my opportunities.

142
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,323
If you don't,
and then you're not taking your boss's 

143
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:53,234
money anyways because it's very seldom,
very frequently the case that he's 

144
00:07:55,791 --> 00:08:00,650
working for a whopping big company,
but he needs an excuse to give you money

145
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,603
because everyone's asking for money all 
the time and so you have to put your 

146
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:08,560
case forward powerfully and 
disagreeable.

147
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,370
Now,
you don't want to do it to disagree,

148
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:11,204
I believe,
because then he's going to think that 

149
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:14,660
you're a son of a bitch and maybe he's 
not going to give you anything and maybe

150
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,760
you'll get fired for being mouthy and 
all of that,

151
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,430
and that certainly happens to people who
are too disagreeable.

152
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,523
You got to get the balance right,
but it's definitely the case and the 

153
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:25,160
other thing that happens to women that's
also worth noting,

154
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,010
and this is probably because they're 
higher negative emotion,

155
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,760
is they tend to underestimate their own 
utility in business settings,

156
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,270
right?

157
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,103
Because if you're trying to evaluate 
what you're like and you're more tilted 

158
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:39,500
towards negative emotion than the things
that you do that are wrong,

159
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:40,334
are going to stand out more,
more on the foreground and the things 

160
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:43,244
that you do that are right.
So if you go into a negotiation and 

161
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:46,244
you're uncertain already because you 
have self doubts and then you're 

162
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:50,114
agreeable in the negotiation,
what's going to happen is that you're 

163
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:53,744
not going to win as often and winning in
a business setting or in their career 

164
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,374
development setting means more 
opportunity for promotion and more 

165
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:04,290
revenue generated.
Now the downside of that of course,

166
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,124
is as you climb the business hierarchy 
is that you also have to take on more 

167
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:12,270
responsibility and that responsibility 
is sometimes unpleasant as well.

168
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:13,104
Especially to people who are agreeable 
because you're not necessarily liked if 

169
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:18,630
you're in a position of authority and 
agreeable people.

170
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,463
Really liked to be liked,
it's their primary motive motivator 

171
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:24,030
because they're concerned about the 
maintenance,

172
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:24,690
I would say,
of,

173
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:25,550
of,
of,

174
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,633
of intimate positive relationships,
and that also makes them conflict 

175
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:31,050
avoidant.
Okay,

176
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:33,780
so now you guys can think about this,
but.

177
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,210
But I'll,
I'll tell you why.

178
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:39,900
I think the personality differences 
between men and women exist now.

179
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,763
These are speculative hypotheses,
but they're reasonably well documented 

180
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,230
by,
by the relevant literature.

181
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:47,400
So let's,
let's think about it.

182
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:48,234
The first thing we might think about is 
what's the difference between men and 

183
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:51,420
women?
Well,

184
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,250
how do they differ?
Well,

185
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:54,084
the first thing we might observe is that
if you look at personality differences 

186
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,380
be between pre pubescent boys and girls.
They're not very large.

187
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,830
Boys and girls don't differ in terms of 
their trait.

188
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:06,150
Neuroticism,
for example,

189
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,640
what happens is that when puberty kicks 
in,

190
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:09,474
women's trait neuroticism rises and it 
stays higher than men for the rest of 

191
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:13,920
their life.

192
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,753
And this is why you see this reflected 
in the different kinds of 

193
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:19,170
psychopathology that be set.
The two sexes,

194
00:10:19,171 --> 00:10:21,810
so men are overrepresented in 
alcoholism,

195
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,880
drug abuse,
antisocial personality,

196
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,803
and a host of learning disorders.
As well as that attention deficit 

197
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:27,834
disorder and women are overrepresented 
in depression and anxiety primarily now 

198
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:32,443
it seems to be tightly associated with 
higher levels of trait neuroticism 

199
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:38,610
because maybe it's if you're at the 95th
percentile or higher,

200
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:39,444
let's say in trait neuroticism,
there isn't much different than 

201
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,510
difference between that and being 
somewhat prone to depression and anxiety

202
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,620
and because the curves overlap,
you know the,

203
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:49,900
the,
the,

204
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,733
the curves are identical.
The normal distributions are identical 

205
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:54,930
for men and women.
You tilt the one to the,

206
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,490
to the right,
to the women's,

207
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:59,190
curved to the right towards higher 
levels of the rotor system.

208
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,263
You go out and you look for the person 
in 20 who has the highest levels of 

209
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:04,080
negative emotion.

210
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,480
It's much more likely to be female than 
male.

211
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,700
Okay,
so let's see if we can figure out why.

212
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,210
So we're going to tell you some things,
basic differences between men and women.

213
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:14,260
And you can tell me what you think about
it if you are,

214
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,080
if you agree or disagree.
Okay.

215
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,093
First size,
differential emergence between men and 

216
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:21,000
women at puberty,
right?

217
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,040
Because boys and girls are roughly the 
same size.

218
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:23,874
And roughly the same strength,
but men get bigger at puberty when the 

219
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:29,040
testosterone kicks in,
and more importantly,

220
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,113
not only do they get taller and heavier,
but their upper body strength is much 

221
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,923
higher,
and that's a real issue for for combat 

222
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,870
because human beings punch.
There's other animals that do that.

223
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:41,830
Kangaroos do that two ways,
so we're not the.

224
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:42,803
We're not the only people that punch,
but we have clubs on the ends of our 

225
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:47,400
arms and so that's how we defend 
ourselves.

226
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,590
And so if you have a lot of upper body 
strength,

227
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:53,320
especially short across the shoulders 
and you're heavier than you can step the

228
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:54,154
punch and it's a lot more devastating.
Now it is the case that if you look at 

229
00:11:57,431 --> 00:12:01,120
the statistics for physical altercations
in marriage,

230
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:04,300
women attack their husbands more often.
The husbands attack their wives.

231
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,520
While you think that,
why is that?

232
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,520
Well,
let's assume that there isn't any reason

233
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:10,354
other than both.
People in a relationship can get upset 

234
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,860
and the women know that if they hit 
their husbands,

235
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:16,900
nothing's really going to happen,
right?

236
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:18,140
Because if you're a real,
you know,

237
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,680
if you're a woman about that high and 
your husband is say,

238
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:22,480
my height,
you're,

239
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,330
unless you hit me with an object or 
something that's sharp,

240
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:28,240
the probability that you're going to do 
by any serious damage is pretty low.

241
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,223
You might hurt me,
but if I do the reverse and hit you and 

242
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:33,490
I really hit you,
then I might kill you.

243
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,800
And so the reason at least one of the 
reasons why women can be more physically

244
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:39,634
aggressive in minor ways in a 
relationship is because everyone knows 

245
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,143
the wife and the husband equally,
that the consequence of the physical 

246
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:50,440
aggression is much more limited.
So men do more serious damage to women,

247
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,930
but women are more aggressive in 
relationships.

248
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,700
So That's interesting.
So okay,

249
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:55,534
so there's a bar.
There is a body size difference that's 

250
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:59,620
important to strength differential.
That's important.

251
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,723
Next thing I think.
So let's assume that the reason that 

252
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:07,150
women are higher in sensitivity to 
negative emotion is because the world is

253
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:09,490
actually more dangerous to women.
Right?

254
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:10,324
Because that would be the most logical 
reason why there would be a sex 

255
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:14,494
difference in a sex difference in it's 
something like fear or sensitivity to 

256
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:17,794
punishment.
Well first there's the danger of 

257
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,610
physical altercation.
Second,

258
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,080
there's the sexual danger.

259
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,110
So women become sexually vulnerable at 
puberty.

260
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,070
And why do I say vulnerable?
While it's straightforward,

261
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,913
it's because the cost of sex for women 
is way higher than it is for men are 

262
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,033
certainly has been throughout our 
evolutionary history because if a man 

263
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:37,654
has an unwanted sexual encounter while 
then he walks away and maybe he's 

264
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,930
persecuted by the state or prosecuted by
the state for it.

265
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,003
But if a woman has an unwanted,
unwarranted or incautious sexual 

266
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:51,130
encounter and she ends up pregnant then,
well,

267
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,800
in traditional societies that's you're 
just done.

268
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,170
And even in modern societies that are 
rich,

269
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:57,490
like ours,
you're,

270
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,421
it's,
it's,

271
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:01,300
uh,
I don't have to go into that.

272
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,760
It's big trouble no matter what you do 
about it.

273
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:05,410
It's big trouble.
So being,

274
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,260
being more nervous about.
That makes perfect sense.

275
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:13,030
But then here's the last thing.
And I think that women's nervous systems

276
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:14,860
are not adapted to women.

277
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,103
I think women's nervous systems are 
adapted to the mother infant dyad and 

278
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,830
because you are not the same creature 
when you have an infant,

279
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,873
not at all,
you're way more vulnerable and it's 

280
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:30,670
partly because you have to express their
vulnerability of the infant and you also

281
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:32,410
have to care for it.
Right?

282
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:35,740
So you think about an infant especially 
under nine months,

283
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,693
so let's say how are you going to be 
wired up if you're going to optimally 

284
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:43,120
care for an infant under nine months,
and I'm saying under nine months because

285
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,283
women generally do the bulk of childcare
for infants who are under nine months 

286
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:50,140
old and part of the reason for that.
There's a whole host of reasons,

287
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:52,760
but part of the reasons for that 
obviously is that they breastfeed,

288
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,133
but imagine what you need to be wired up
biologically in order to care for an 

289
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:57,080
infant.

290
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,840
First of all,
they're very demanding,

291
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,333
right?
Because they're completely helpless and 

292
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:06,050
they're demanding 24 hours a day and 
it's quite.

293
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,603
It's quite a.
it's quite an emotional load and an 

294
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:13,610
infant under nine months is never wrong.
Right.

295
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,790
What you do to an infant under nine 
months is when they're in distress,

296
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,330
you always respond,
you never tell the infant,

297
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,150
get your act together and stop whining.
Right?

298
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,103
Which you can do,
say to an end to a child that's 18 

299
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:26,864
months old,
you can start having that sort of 

300
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:28,754
conversation,
but under nine months it's like nothing 

301
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:31,544
is the infant's fault.
It's surrounded in an extraordinarily 

302
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:35,624
threatening world and you have to be 
responsive to what it needs regardless 

303
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,584
of what you want and you have to be very
sensitive to the threats that emerge in 

304
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:43,094
the environment and so I think the price
that women pay for that ability to have 

305
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:47,894
an intimate relationship with infants in
the very earliest stages of development 

306
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,034
is that their nervous systems are 
actually wired so that they can perform 

307
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:56,540
that role optimally.

308
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,793
And the disadvantage to that is that 
having a temperament like that doesn't 

309
00:16:00,621 --> 00:16:03,500
work that well when you're dealing with 
adult men,

310
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,663
especially when you're dealing with them
and in a business environment because 

311
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:08,930
it's not the same thing.
Not at all.

312
00:16:08,931 --> 00:16:10,790
It's a competitive environment.
So,

313
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:11,624
okay,
so agreeable people are compassionate 

314
00:16:12,831 --> 00:16:15,110
and polite.
What are disagreeable people like?

315
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,900
They're tough minded,
they're blunt,

316
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:18,943
they're competitive,
and they won't do a damn thing they 

317
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,630
don't want to do so it isn't exactly 
that they're aggressive,

318
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:24,464
although they will push you the hell out
of their way if you're in the way 

319
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:27,644
they're not.
They're not like volatile like you are 

320
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:33,440
if you're high in neuroticism.
It isn't defensive aggression.

321
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:36,860
It's more like predatory aggression.
It's dominance behavior.

322
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,320
And so for someone who's high,
who's high,

323
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,453
highly disagreeable,
they look at the world as a place in 

324
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:45,170
which they can compete and win.

325
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,480
And I'll tell you a story,
I have a friend.

326
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,220
I gave him my personality test,
the Big Five aspects scale that Colin de

327
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,220
young developed in my lab and
I knew he was a disagreeable guy.

328
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,000
And by interacting with them,
um,

329
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,530
I mean he's even rude to people sort of 
spontaneously on the street.

330
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,010
I actually liked them quite a bit.
He's very,

331
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:05,844
very funny.
He's also very conscientious so you can 

332
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:09,260
trust it,
but it's disagreeable as hell.

333
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,663
And uh,
so I gave him this test because I 

334
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,124
thought it would be funny and he came 
out as the most disagreeable person in 

335
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,784
10,000,
so reasonably reasonable and 

336
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,840
compassionate 30th percentile,
but like point zero,

337
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:25,190
zero,
one in politeness,

338
00:17:25,191 --> 00:17:28,610
so he's extraordinarily blunt and he'll 
just say absolutely anything,

339
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:29,444
no matter how horrible it is.
And he was often brought into 

340
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:32,654
corporations to sort of clean them up.
So if a corporation was tilting and not 

341
00:17:35,841 --> 00:17:36,674
doing well,
they bring him into find out how the 

342
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:39,950
useless people were in fire them.

343
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,083
And I talked to them about that because 
I've had the opportunity to have to not 

344
00:17:44,811 --> 00:17:46,790
have graduate students in my lab for 
example,

345
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,440
that weren't performing well.
And I find it very,

346
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:52,380
very difficult dress someone down and 
certainly difficult to fire them.

347
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:54,750
I just hate it because I'm actually 
quite agreeable person,

348
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:58,080
much to my chagrin.
And I asked him about that and I said,

349
00:17:58,081 --> 00:17:58,950
well,
what do you do?

350
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,530
You have to fire people all the time.
How do you handle that?

351
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:02,430
He says,
handle it.

352
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,800
I enjoy it.
And I thought,

353
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,780
wow,
that's so interesting that someone would

354
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:07,890
have that response.
I said,

355
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:09,180
well,
what do you mean you enjoy it?

356
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:09,751
He said,
look,

357
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:14,070
I go into these companies and I analyze 
the performance of groups of people.

358
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,933
Right?
And there's in those groups or people 

359
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:16,794
who are really striving,
really trying hard and working 

360
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,910
themselves really hard and being 
productive.

361
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,460
And then there's these people that are 
just doing nothing.

362
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:25,800
They're completely in the way.
They don't carry their weight at all.

363
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:27,720
They take advantage every chance they 
get.

364
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,000
And they're always whining about why 
they can't work.

365
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:30,834
It's like I find out who they are.
I called them into my office and I tell 

366
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:36,000
them exactly what they've been doing.
It's like hit the road buddy.

367
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,970
You've had your had your run of it.
And I thought,

368
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,440
Oh yeah,
okay,

369
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,450
fair enough.
You know.

370
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,840
Well,
I can tell you,

371
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:43,674
you know,
I've had situations in my lab where I 

372
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:45,744
had underperforming graduate students 
and one of the things that was really 

373
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:49,674
awful about that was that it was really 
hard on the high performing graduate 

374
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:53,240
students,
you know,

375
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,293
because they felt that even being in the
same category as the people who weren't 

376
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:01,260
working hard and pulling their weight,
devalued what they were doing,

377
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:01,950
you know?

378
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,490
And that's exactly right.
And so this is also why there's,

379
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:08,550
there's a conscientiousness trait,
agreeableness trait.

380
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,300
Conscientious people judge you on your 
accomplishments,

381
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,223
right?
They don't give a damn about your 

382
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,270
feelings,
not a bit.

383
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,930
It's like are you doing the work or not?
Whereas agreeable people think,

384
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:19,764
well,
you know,

385
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,480
your mother is sick and you know,
you've,

386
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,460
you've got a bunch of family problems 
and,

387
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,443
and we all have to take care of each 
other and it's no wonder that you're 

388
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:27,594
having a rough time and like you can't 
say that one of those attitudes is 

389
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:31,434
correct and the other isn't correct.
You can't say that there wouldn't be 

390
00:19:34,351 --> 00:19:37,530
those two dimensions if there wasn't 
something correct about both of them,

391
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,770
but you can certainly point out that 
often they conflict,

392
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:41,963
you know,
and so the demand for for inclusiveness 

393
00:19:43,651 --> 00:19:48,270
and unity and care and the demand for 
high level performance in a hierarchical

394
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,090
structure.

395
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:49,923
They're very different orientations in 
the world and so it's complicated for 

396
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:58,950
people who are agreeable and 
conscientious and actually I think often

397
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,113
that large corporations and large,
large institutions of any sort run on 

398
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:05,754
the unheralded labor of people who are 
high in agreeableness and high in 

399
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:09,924
conscientiousness.
They're disproportionately women and my 

400
00:20:12,151 --> 00:20:15,840
experience in large institutions has 
been that if you want to hire someone to

401
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:18,510
exploit appropriately,
no,

402
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,403
not appropriately.
If you want to hire someone to exploit 

403
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:22,134
productively,
you higher middle aged women who are 

404
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:28,020
hyper conscientious and who are 
agreeable because they'll do everything.

405
00:20:28,021 --> 00:20:28,854
They won't take credit for it and they 
won't complain and that's nasty and I 

406
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:33,054
think that happens all the time.
And so one of the things you have to be 

407
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:35,664
careful of if you're agreeable,
is not to be exploited because you'll 

408
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:39,834
lie not to be exploited.
And I think the reason for that is 

409
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:44,550
because you're wired to be exploited by 
infants.

410
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,970
And so that just doesn't work so well in
the actual world.

411
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:49,804
And one of the things,
one of the things that happens very 

412
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:52,540
often in psychotherapy,
you know,

413
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,730
people come to psychotherapy for 
multiple reasons,

414
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,640
but one of them is they often come 
because they're too agreeable.

415
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,820
And so what they get is so called 
assertiveness training.

416
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,460
Although it's not exactly assertiveness 
that's being trained.

417
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,940
What it is is the ability to learn how 
to negotiate on your own behalf.

418
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,250
And one of the things I tell agreeable 
people,

419
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:10,780
especially if they're conscientious,
is

420
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,173
say what you think,
tell the truth about what you think 

421
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,400
there's going to be things you think 
that you think are nasty and harsh,

422
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,840
and they probably are nasty and harsh,
but they're also probably true.

423
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,140
And you need to bring those up to the 
forefront and deliver the message.

424
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:26,974
And it's not straightforward at all 
because agreeable people do not like 

425
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,230
conflict,
not at all.

426
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,840
They smoothed the water,
you know when you can see,

427
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:35,703
you can see why that is in accordance 
with the hypothesis that I'd been 

428
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:41,140
putting forward.
You don't want conflict around infants.

429
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,200
It's too damn dangerous.
You don't want fights to break out.

430
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:48,430
You don't want anything to disturb the 
relative peace you know,

431
00:21:48,431 --> 00:21:52,840
and if you're also more prone to being 
hurt physically and perhaps emotionally,

432
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:53,883
you also may be loath to engage in the 
kind of high intensity conflict that 

433
00:21:56,861 --> 00:22:00,160
will solve problems in the short term 
because the law to conflict,

434
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,503
it takes a lot of conflict,
is solve problems in the short term and 

435
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,460
you know if that can spiral up to where 
it's dangerous,

436
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:08,350
which it can,
if it gets uncontrolled,

437
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,393
it might be safer in the short term to 
keep the waters smooth and to not delve 

438
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:16,060
into those situations where conflict 
emerges.

439
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,120
The problem with that is it's not a very
good medium to longterm strategy,

440
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:19,720
right?

441
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,553
Because lots,
lots of times there are things you have 

442
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:22,803
to talk about because they're not gonna 
go away and so partly what you do with 

443
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,054
agreeable people as you get them to 
figure out and they have a hard time 

444
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:31,054
with this too.
If you ask a disagreeable person what 

445
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,440
what he wants say or she wants,
they'll tell you right away,

446
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,493
they know it's like,
this is what I want and this is how I'm 

447
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,730
to get it,
but an agreeable people,

448
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:40,564
especially if they're really agreeable,
are so agreeable that they often don't 

449
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:47,320
even know what they want because they're
so accustomed to living for other people

450
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,333
and to finding out what other people 
want and to try and make them 

451
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:50,974
comfortable and so forth.
That it's harder for them to find a 

452
00:22:53,321 --> 00:22:56,410
sense of their own desires as they move 
through life.

453
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,573
And that's not.
But there's situations where that's 

454
00:23:00,251 --> 00:23:01,084
advantageous,
but it's certainly not advantageous if 

455
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:03,934
you're going to try to a,
forged yourself a career that just 

456
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:09,040
doesn't work at all.
So.

457
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,433
Alright.
What else do I want to tell you about 

458
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:16,360
agreeableness?
Well,

459
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:20,650
I could tell you a little bit about the.
The regulation of aggression when one of

460
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:23,380
the things I studied,
especially when I was in Montreal,

461
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:28,381
was the development of antisocial 
behavior in children and in and in a and

462
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:32,740
in adolescence and antisocial children,
so they tend to be aggressive,

463
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,720
antisocial children tend to turn into 
antisocial conduct disorder.

464
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:40,330
Technically speaking,
conduct disordered children tend to turn

465
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:41,164
into conduct disordered adolescents and 
then they tend to turn into antisocial 

466
00:23:43,811 --> 00:23:47,090
and criminal adults.
And so I can tell you a little bit about

467
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:47,924
how that progresses.
I think because it's quite interesting 

468
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:50,990
and it isn't what people generally 
think.

469
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,530
So the first thing is if you want to be 
criminal,

470
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:55,364
the best way to do it is to be really 
low in agreeableness and really low in 

471
00:23:57,351 --> 00:23:58,220
conscientiousness.

472
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,210
Low in agreeableness means things are 
for me and not for you,

473
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,703
and you're not going to get me to do a 
damn thing that I don't want to do and 

474
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:06,554
I'll stand my ground and low in 
conscientiousness means you can do all 

475
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:11,660
the work and all sit back and take the 
benefits.

476
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:16,640
And so if you have someone who's really 
disagreeable and really unconscientious,

477
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:19,100
you have someone who's starting to 
border on psychopath,

478
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,760
and if you add high intelligence and 
high emotional stability to that,

479
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,910
then you have someone who won't work but
will reap the benefits.

480
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:26,744
Who doesn't give a damn about you?
Who is assertive as Helen who's smart 

481
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,763
and a person like that's also going to 
be charismatic because extroverted 

482
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,980
disagreeable people are kind of 
narcissistic but there.

483
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,053
But they'll,
they'll put themselves forward strongly 

484
00:24:39,531 --> 00:24:41,180
and if they don't show any signs of 
fear,

485
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:42,014
that also indicates that they're 
confident and it's easy for people to 

486
00:24:44,211 --> 00:24:45,680
confuse that with competence.

487
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:48,170
And that's how psychopaths get away with
what they're doing.

488
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,890
Although they have to move from person 
to person because their religion,

489
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:54,740
their reputation will track.
So anyways,

490
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,813
back to the development of aggression in
children in the development of 

491
00:24:58,221 --> 00:25:00,320
criminality and adults.
Here's how it seems to work,

492
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:02,180
at least in part,
it's more complicated than this,

493
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:04,970
but I'll put in some of the sociological
elements as well.

494
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,660
So if you take children and you group 
them together in age,

495
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:17,830
age eight in groups defined by age,
so let's say a 32 year olds,

496
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,450
33 year olds,
34 year olds,

497
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,770
all the way up to 18th,
and then you watch them interact and you

498
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,550
cold their behavior for kicking,
biting,

499
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,550
fighting,
and property theft.

500
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,390
Then what you'll find is that the two 
year olds are by far the most aggressive

501
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:37,700
of the lot.
So that's pretty interesting.

502
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:38,600
You know,
because you think,

503
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:39,434
well,
children are naturally peaceful and if 

504
00:25:41,151 --> 00:25:42,830
they are aggressive it's because they 
learn it.

505
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,570
It's like,
no,

506
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,330
that's true for a small minority of 
children.

507
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,523
But there's a substantial number of 
children who are aggressive at two by 

508
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,620
nature.
Most of them are male.

509
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,410
Now that doesn't mean most children are 
like that because they're not.

510
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,040
Even if you look at two year olds who 
are the most aggressive human beings,

511
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,203
most two year olds aren't aggressive,
but some of them are and most of those 

512
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:06,500
are male.
Okay?

513
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:07,334
So then let's say you identify this 
cohort of aggressive two year olds and 

514
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:11,534
you track them across time,
track them for the next two to four 

515
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:17,240
years or the next track them until 
they're four years old.

516
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:22,810
What you find is the vast majority of 
the hyper aggressive male till year olds

517
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,770
get socialized perfectly well.
So by the time they're four,

518
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,630
they're temperamentally probably still 
more aggressive,

519
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,464
but they've become civilized little 
monsters so other people can tolerate 

520
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:33,554
them and that means that they've had 
parents or peers or educational 

521
00:26:37,191 --> 00:26:38,024
experiences that enabled them to learn 
how to interact productively with other 

522
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:43,680
kids and to bring their aggressive 
nature under control.

523
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,753
Some of that seems to be mediated by the
opportunity to engage in rough and 

524
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:51,870
tumble play and that's one of the things
that we know that that helps socialize.

525
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:52,890
Rats,
for example.

526
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:53,724
It's vital to them,
but it also seems to really be good for 

527
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:59,190
socializing young kids and rough and 
tumble play,

528
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:02,580
which is something that adult males 
particularly like to do with young kids.

529
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:03,414
By the way,
not not before nine months because 

530
00:27:05,221 --> 00:27:06,054
they're just too little,
but once they become ambulatory and you 

531
00:27:08,391 --> 00:27:09,700
know,
kind of poppy like,

532
00:27:09,701 --> 00:27:10,534
so that they're a little bit more robust
than you can play a lot with them and 

533
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,500
you can play with them right at the edge
of danger to which kids.

534
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,870
Absolutely.
They absolutely go nuts for that.

535
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,330
They love that.
So when,

536
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,293
when I had little kids,
I made this kind of wrestling ring out 

537
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:23,814
of these two couches that we had that 
would hook together and I'd bring them 

538
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:29,220
on there and toss them up in the air and
catch them,

539
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:29,851
you know,
eight,

540
00:27:29,851 --> 00:27:30,684
10 feet.

541
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,823
No,
no,

542
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,653
no,
no.

543
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:36,630
A foot in the air and catch them and 
they go like this and then,

544
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:37,464
you know,
I catch them and they'd laugh and I'd 

545
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,430
throw them up and they're all freaked 
out and then they'd laugh and you know,

546
00:27:41,431 --> 00:27:44,220
so they're learning trust with that in 
an embodied way.

547
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,340
And they're also learning.
And this is from stretching them out and

548
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:48,174
wrestling them and twisting them around 
and letting them pull on your hair and 

549
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:51,750
hit you.
And all of those things,

550
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,823
they learn deep in their bones,
exactly what can hurt them and what 

551
00:27:55,831 --> 00:27:56,664
doesn't in the.
You want to kind of push them to the 

552
00:27:57,721 --> 00:27:58,554
edge so that they can tell the 
difference between what hurts and what 

553
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:02,164
still within the realm of the game.
And you do the same thing when they're 

554
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:05,754
wrestling with you.
So they learn not to awkwardly stick 

555
00:28:07,711 --> 00:28:09,510
their thumb in your eye or,
or,

556
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,820
or,
or do things that are actually painful.

557
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,490
Like grab your lip and pull it,
you know,

558
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:14,041
it's like,
no,

559
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:16,620
no,
you let go of my lip,

560
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,513
you know.
And so that seems to help regulate the 

561
00:28:19,921 --> 00:28:20,754
aggressive impulses in and help the 
church child find a more appropriate 

562
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:25,404
embodiment.
You could think that what you're doing 

563
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:27,084
in some sense when you're rough and 
tumble playing with kids is teaching 

564
00:28:29,131 --> 00:28:31,470
them how to dance because that is what 
you're doing.

565
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,693
You know,
you're making them comfortable in their 

566
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:34,644
bodies,
in all of its extension and building in 

567
00:28:36,871 --> 00:28:37,704
that kind of body fluency that you see 
in people who are well situated inside 

568
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:41,934
themselves.
And so that's something to really think 

569
00:28:43,441 --> 00:28:43,911
about.
You know?

570
00:28:43,911 --> 00:28:45,150
And it's,
it's appalling.

571
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,193
We know that the ability to engage in 
rough and tumble play among rats 

572
00:28:48,721 --> 00:28:50,130
inhibits aggression,
impulsive,

573
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:53,810
aggressive aggression among rats.
We also know that if you deprive rats,

574
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:57,210
have the ability to have the opportunity
to engage in rough and tumble play,

575
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,273
they,
they show prefrontal cortical 

576
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:00,114
developmental deficits and manifest 
behaviors that are akin to attention 

577
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:05,340
deficit disorder,
which you can then treat with Ritalin.

578
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:06,563
And so one of the things that's 
happening with boys because they're way 

579
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:12,240
more dosed with attention deficit 
disorder medication than girls,

580
00:29:12,241 --> 00:29:17,241
is that there are natural proclivity to 
engage in robust and troublesome.

581
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,413
Active play isn't appropriate for a 
school environment where you're just 

582
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:22,494
supposed to sit down and shut up.
And so the kids get hyperactive and 

583
00:29:25,471 --> 00:29:26,304
instead of letting them out to run 
around until they fall over half 

584
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,390
exhausted,
which is exactly what you should do,

585
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,920
you know,
you medicate them.

586
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,500
So that are exploratory systems which 
are,

587
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:35,823
um,
the,

588
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,430
the activity of which is facilitated by 
the,

589
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:42,280
by the dual pub anergic agonist.
That's the adhd medication,

590
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,300
suppresses the play function.
It's absolutely appalling.

591
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,210
There's no excuse for it,
you know,

592
00:29:48,211 --> 00:29:48,580
and,
but it,

593
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,413
it's a good,
it's a good indictment of the education 

594
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:51,934
system because why in the world would 
you take six year old kids and get them 

595
00:29:55,091 --> 00:29:55,924
to sit without moving for five hours 
unless you want them to grow up fat and 

596
00:29:59,261 --> 00:30:00,070
stupid?

597
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,080
Why in the world would you train them to
do that?

598
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,160
Well,
it's easier.

599
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,750
That's one thing you know,
and,

600
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,873
and when they're sitting there,
there's nothing disruptive about the 

601
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:09,550
rough and tumble play and that can be 
quite,

602
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,410
you know,
play can be quite disruptive.

603
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,513
So anyways,
most of these kids are reasonably well 

604
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:17,500
socialized by the time they're the age 
of four music,

605
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:18,334
one mechanism or another,
they learn how to regulate their 

606
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:21,304
aggression and they learn how to engage 
in fictional play structures with other 

607
00:30:23,951 --> 00:30:24,784
kids.
They learn how to cooperate and compete 

608
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,063
and the advantage to having a well 
socialized disagreeable person is that 

609
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,380
they really don't let much get in their 
way.

610
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,500
So if you can get a kid who's 
disagreeable,

611
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:36,334
socialized,
that person can be quite quite the 

612
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:38,681
creature,
you know,

613
00:30:38,681 --> 00:30:39,514
because they're very,
they're very forward moving in their 

614
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:43,480
nature and very difficult to stop.

615
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,020
But if you don't get them successfully 
domesticated,

616
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:50,740
tamed,
roughly speaking by the time they're for

617
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,870
their peers,
reject them,

618
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,423
and that's a big problem because your 
job as a parent is to make your child 

619
00:30:57,791 --> 00:31:01,340
socially desirable by the age of four.
I got it.

620
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,253
You want to burn that into your brain 
because people don't know that that's 

621
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,090
your job.
And here's,

622
00:31:07,091 --> 00:31:08,950
here's why.
If you think it's easy,

623
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:12,250
if you think about it carefully,
so you imagine you've got a.

624
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,143
you've got a three year old child,
so it's sort of halfway through that 

625
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:18,490
initial period of socialization and you 
take that child out in public,

626
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,220
okay,
what do you want for the Child?

627
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,650
Who Cares about you?
What do you want from the child,

628
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,513
for the Child?
You want the child to be able to 

629
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:27,124
interact with other children and adults 
so that the children are welcoming and 

630
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:33,490
smile and wanting to play with him or 
her.

631
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,780
And so the adults are happy to see the 
child and treat him or her properly,

632
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,003
and if your child's a horrible little 
monster because you're afraid of 

633
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:43,300
disciplining them or you don't know how 
to do that properly,

634
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,433
then what they're going to do is they're
going to experience nothing but 

635
00:31:47,111 --> 00:31:51,340
rejection from other children and false 
smiles from other parents and adults.

636
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,780
And that's so.
Then you're throwing the child out there

637
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:58,600
into a world where every single face 
that they see is either hostile or lying

638
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,093
and that's not something that's going to
be particularly conducive to the mental 

639
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:03,304
health or the wellbeing of your child.
If your child can learn a couple simple 

640
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:09,520
rules of behavior,
like don't interrupt adults when they're

641
00:32:09,521 --> 00:32:10,354
talking too much and pay attention and 
try not to hit the other kids over the 

642
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:16,870
head with the truck anymore than is 
absolutely necessary then and you know,

643
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:18,520
and share and play properly.

644
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,353
Then when they meet other kids,
the kids are going to try out a few 

645
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:22,624
little play routines on them and that's 
going to go well and then they're going 

646
00:32:24,331 --> 00:32:25,164
to go off and socialize each other for 
the rest of their lives because that's 

647
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:31,150
what happens is that from four years old
onwards,

648
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,253
the primary socialization with children 
takes place among other children and so 

649
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:36,874
if the kids don't get in on that early,
they don't move into that developmental 

650
00:32:40,641 --> 00:32:44,330
spiral upwards and they're left behind 
and you can imagine how terrible that is

651
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:48,370
because a four year old will not play 
with another four year old who's too,

652
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,383
but a five year old certainly will not 
play with a five year old who's too 

653
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,343
right,
because the gap is just starting to get 

654
00:32:55,251 --> 00:33:00,251
unbelievably large and so the kids start
out behind and then the peers leave that

655
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,244
behind and then those kids are alienated
and outside the Peer Group for the rest 

656
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:05,624
of their life.

657
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,750
Those are the ones that grow up to be 
longterm antisocial,

658
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,700
right?
They're already aggressive.

659
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,480
It doesn't dip down.
Now what happens to normal boys,

660
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,433
roughly speaking,
imagine the aggressive two-year-old 

661
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:18,943
types.
It gets socialized so their level of 

662
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:21,464
aggression goes down and then they hit 
puberty and testosterone kicks in and 

663
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:26,390
bang,
levels of aggression go back up,

664
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:30,560
and so that's why males are criminals 
between the ages roughly of 16 and about

665
00:33:30,561 --> 00:33:33,560
25.
So when it matches the creativity curve,

666
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,730
by the way,
it's so cool.

667
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:37,430
If you look at the spike of creativity 
among men,

668
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:38,264
16 to 25 and it starts to go down,
criminality matches that absolutely 

669
00:33:42,111 --> 00:33:43,880
perfectly.
So that's quite cool.

670
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,193
So and part of so the testosterone 
levels raise the average level of 

671
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:52,010
aggression among men.
It's more dominance than aggression.

672
00:33:52,011 --> 00:33:52,844
Actually,
testosterone is by no means all bad and 

673
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:57,680
then it starts to decrease at about age 
25 or 26,

674
00:33:57,681 --> 00:33:58,700
which is usually with men.

675
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:03,020
Stop staying up late at night,
stopped drinking as much,

676
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,213
develop a full time career and take on 
the burdens and responsibilities and 

677
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:10,430
opportunities that are associated with a
longterm partner and family.

678
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,640
And so while.
So that's,

679
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,190
that's the development of,
of,

680
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,043
of what would I would I would call 
predatory aggression because I also 

681
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:21,074
think that the,
the agreeableness distribution is 

682
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:27,650
probably something like predatory 
aggression versus maternal sympathy.

683
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,450
It's something like that.
So if you look at other,

684
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,170
if you look at other mammals that are,
that are predators,

685
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,090
because we're predators as well as prey 
animals.

686
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,193
If you look at other animals like bears,
the male bear has absolutely nothing to 

687
00:34:39,471 --> 00:34:41,210
do with the raising of the infants.
In fact,

688
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:42,044
the female bears will keep the mail the 
hell away because he's likely to kill 

689
00:34:44,631 --> 00:34:45,464
the infants and maybe even to eat them.
So there's no matter analogy at all in 

690
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:54,650
solitary male mammalian predators.

691
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,710
Now it depends on how social they are,
but roughly speaking,

692
00:34:57,711 --> 00:35:00,380
that's the situation.
Whereas with human beings,

693
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,720
males are quite maternal.
So.

694
00:35:02,721 --> 00:35:03,920
But anyways,
I think the,

695
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,083
I think the,
the extreme of agreeableness on the low 

696
00:35:08,361 --> 00:35:11,420
end,
so disagreeableness is predation and the

697
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:13,940
extreme on the upper end is maternal 
caring.

698
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,670
And so,
and those two things compete,

699
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:19,550
right?
Obviously it's very difficult to be both

700
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:21,800
of those at the same time.
And so men,

701
00:35:21,801 --> 00:35:23,300
of course,
in the wild,

702
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,220
so to speak,
are very,

703
00:35:25,221 --> 00:35:26,054
very few women hunt in modern societies 
or an or an archaic societies and you 

704
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:31,124
can also understand why that is because 
hunting actually requires hurting 

705
00:35:34,281 --> 00:35:35,480
something,
killing it,

706
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,853
and it's usually something that's not 
very impressed about being hurt or 

707
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:41,670
killed in that will emit a lot of 
distress while it's happening.

708
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,070
And so for anybody who's compassionate,
who's,

709
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,070
who's got compassionate,
you know,

710
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,970
one of the fundamental elements of their
temperament,

711
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,610
that's something they're just not going 
to be able to tolerate at all.

712
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,890
So there's,
you know,

713
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:55,770
in the evolutionary landscape because 
that's really what we're talking about.

714
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:56,843
There's tension behind the development 
of different modes of being in the 

715
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,350
world.
And if you're good at one thing,

716
00:36:01,351 --> 00:36:02,184
that sometimes means that you can't be 
good at the other thing at the same 

717
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:05,724
time.
So I was going to have a guest speaker 

718
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:12,840
for you last week,
but the person I had invited in had some

719
00:36:12,841 --> 00:36:14,550
familial troubles.
So that didn't work out.

720
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:18,240
But she's a graduate student of mine and
one of the things that we'd been working

721
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:20,700
on in my lab,
generally speaking,

722
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:25,710
is the delineation of the relationship 
between personality traits and political

723
00:36:25,711 --> 00:36:26,544
belief.
Until I've told you a little bit about 

724
00:36:28,171 --> 00:36:30,300
the things that distinguished liberals 
from conservatives,

725
00:36:30,301 --> 00:36:31,134
right?
The Conservatives are high in 

726
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:32,844
conscientiousness,
especially orderliness and low in trait 

727
00:36:35,911 --> 00:36:38,750
openness.
And so that means a conservative,

728
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:43,590
someone who puts things in boxes,
puts the boxes in order and doesn't like

729
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:44,760
them to be messed up.

730
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,430
Right?
So they liked the borders between things

731
00:36:47,431 --> 00:36:50,400
to remain determinant.
And,

732
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,260
and,
and uh,

733
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,183
what would you say an inviolable.
And I think that's true at every level 

734
00:36:56,461 --> 00:36:58,590
from the conceptual all the way up to 
the political.

735
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,650
I think that the fundamental political 
question,

736
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:06,090
and I think this is why the temperaments
align across these political dimensions,

737
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,670
is whether the borders between things 
should be open or closed.

738
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,103
You see this reflected it worldwide 
right now in the arguments about 

739
00:37:12,601 --> 00:37:13,434
immigration,
right?

740
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,823
Because the liberal types of saying open
the gates and the Conservatives are 

741
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:18,510
saying,
wait,

742
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,240
you don't know what you're inviting in.
And you might say,

743
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:22,140
well,
who's right?

744
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,070
And the answer is you don't know.
That's the thing,

745
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:29,460
because sometimes the right answer is 
open the gates.

746
00:37:29,461 --> 00:37:31,410
These are interesting people.
We could trade with them,

747
00:37:31,411 --> 00:37:32,244
we could learn from each other,
and sometimes the answer is don't 

748
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:35,280
bother.

749
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,730
What's going to come in is going to wipe
you out and kill you and really do it.

750
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:39,623
I mean,
so here's an example dot why I think 

751
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,420
orderliness is associated with disgust 
sensitivity,

752
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,020
and it's one of the determining factors 
of conservative political belief.

753
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,630
What happened when the Europeans came to
North America?

754
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,120
What happened when the Spaniards came to
North America?

755
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:58,170
Ninety five percent of the native 
Americans died.

756
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:02,250
Why?
Because the Spaniards brought illness,

757
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,990
smallpox,
measles,

758
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,483
chicken pox,
all of these things that the native 

759
00:38:06,991 --> 00:38:08,880
Americans had absolutely no resistance 
through.

760
00:38:08,881 --> 00:38:12,090
There were hardly any diseases at all.
In north and South America,

761
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:15,180
the Spaniards showed up within 50 to 100
years.

762
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,940
Nineteen out of 20 of the native 
Americans were dead.

763
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,480
You never know what people are bringing 
with them.

764
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,853
And so what that means is that how 
should you respond to people who are 

765
00:38:26,491 --> 00:38:31,080
outside of your circle of familiarity or
the answer is one,

766
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,560
they might kill you in all sorts of ways
to,

767
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:38,380
they might bring with them things to 
trade their of inestimable value.

768
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,240
So you're stuck.
It's like,

769
00:38:40,241 --> 00:38:42,520
how the hell are you going to reconcile 
that problem?

770
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:43,720
And the answer is,
well,

771
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,000
we reconcile at temperamentally roughly 
speaking.

772
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,630
So half the people are temperamentally 
wired up to say,

773
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:49,990
no,
no,

774
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,780
no,
let's keep the damn box is closed.

775
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,170
Took a long time to pack everything in 
there and to get it into order.

776
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,090
And the liberals say,
well wait a minute,

777
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,150
you don't know if you've got things in 
the right boxes to begin with.

778
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:02,343
The things that you're keeping in the 
end are getting stale and old and maybe 

779
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:08,350
we need some new ideas and new people to
rejuvenate the situation.

780
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,433
It's like that's political discussion 
and that political discussion has to 

781
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:13,774
proceed because there's no way of 
solving that problem except by 

782
00:39:16,151 --> 00:39:20,740
discussing it so well.
How does that relate to agreeableness?

783
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:21,574
We also looked at political correctness 
and so here's an interesting thing 

784
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,220
purely from a scientific perspective.

785
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:31,420
You might ask yourself,
if you talk about political correctness,

786
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,283
one of the things that the people who 
tend to be labeled as political 

787
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:38,650
politically correct say is there's no 
such thing as political correctness.

788
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,633
It's just a pejorative label that people
who are impo opposed to those views 

789
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,103
impose on a set of beliefs to demonize 
it perfectly reasonable objection and 

790
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:51,400
you'd never know it might be true,
but the thing is psychometrically.

791
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:52,234
You can solve that problem and you solve
it the same way that you solve the 

792
00:39:54,971 --> 00:39:57,190
problem of what constitutes human 
personality.

793
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:00,610
So this is the way we tried to solve it 
and you can think about methodologically

794
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:01,990
because that's how you should think 
about it.

795
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,183
The first thing we did was collect a 
very large number of statements from 

796
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:07,174
press accounts.
That seemed to indicate what people 

797
00:40:09,731 --> 00:40:12,010
generally refer to as political 
correctness.

798
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:12,844
So we had a small team of people combing
media reports to come out with opinions 

799
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:20,620
or attitudes that looked like they were 
characteristic of the.

800
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:21,603
Of the differentiation between 
politically correct people and people 

801
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:24,364
who aren't politically correct,
so we've got about 400 statements like 

802
00:40:26,861 --> 00:40:30,280
that and what you want to do is you 
imagine that,

803
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:34,600
that there is a core set of beliefs and 
statements that people are defining in a

804
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:35,434
particular way and you're trying to get 
a handle on what that is and even if it 

805
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:40,870
exists,
what you do is over sample it.

806
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,193
If you can find questions that might 
even tangentially be related to the 

807
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,980
phenomena in,
in,

808
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,160
in question,
you include those because the statistics

809
00:40:51,161 --> 00:40:53,320
will take care of the excess.
Okay,

810
00:40:53,321 --> 00:40:56,410
so then what you do is you take your 400
items roughly speaking,

811
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:57,723
and you get people to register the 
degree to which they agree or disagree 

812
00:41:00,821 --> 00:41:01,654
with them.
Get a thousand people to do that and 

813
00:41:03,521 --> 00:41:05,650
then you subject that to a factor 
analysis.

814
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,270
And what the factor analysis does is 
tell you how those questions clump.

815
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,970
Now they might not clump.
So for example,

816
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:16,210
you could do a factor analysis of a set 
of questions and you can find that there

817
00:41:16,211 --> 00:41:20,350
are 200 factors.
Let's let's say at $400.

818
00:41:20,351 --> 00:41:24,790
There's 200 factors and none of them.
There's no big set of questions that are

819
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:26,050
clumping together.
Then you say,

820
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:28,540
well,
there's no evidence here that there is a

821
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:29,374
single underlying phenomena that unifies
those questions that you could 

822
00:41:33,141 --> 00:41:37,130
reasonably characterized with a name.
While that isn't what we found,

823
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:40,280
we found that there were two dimensions 
of political correctness.

824
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,593
One of them looked like liberalism,
except that the people who were 

825
00:41:44,601 --> 00:41:47,120
politically correct,
in addition to being liberal,

826
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,340
we're very high in trait.
Agreeableness

827
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,040
and agreeableness has almost nothing to 
do with the classic liberal conservative

828
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:55,874
divide.
It's weakly related in that 

829
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,960
conservatives are more compassionate 
than liberals.

830
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:00,913
Sorry.
Liberals are more compassionate than 

831
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:02,624
conservatives.
They difference isn't huge and 

832
00:42:04,311 --> 00:42:08,120
conservatives are more polite than 
liberals and the difference isn't huge.

833
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,070
So those are the two aspects of 
agreeableness.

834
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:12,620
If you put them together,
they cancel each other out,

835
00:42:12,621 --> 00:42:14,840
and so on.
Average conservatives and liberals don't

836
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,793
differ in agreeableness,
but polit politically political 

837
00:42:18,261 --> 00:42:22,040
correctness did clump together into two 
categories.

838
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,250
Pc Liberalism,
we called it and pc authoritarianism.

839
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,293
The PC liberals were high in openness,
high in verbal intelligence and high in 

840
00:42:30,891 --> 00:42:31,724
agreeableness.
And the second group was Pc 

841
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,383
Authoritarians,
and they were also high in 

842
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:36,584
agreeableness,
but they were high in orderliness and 

843
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:41,870
the correlation with that was negative 
in relationship to verbal intelligence.

844
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:46,490
So we found that there were two 
categories of political correctness that

845
00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:47,324
it does in fact exist,
but that it's a very unstable construct 

846
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:54,110
because factor one,
which was pc liberalism and factor two,

847
00:42:54,111 --> 00:42:55,550
which was pc authoritarianism.

848
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:59,180
We're only correlated at point one.
And so what it indicates,

849
00:42:59,181 --> 00:43:01,520
and this is our prediction,
roughly speaking from the lab,

850
00:43:01,521 --> 00:43:04,040
is to the degree that there's unity,
so to speak,

851
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:06,980
on the politically correct left,
it'll fragment into two groups.

852
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:10,760
One will be the PC liberals and the 
other will be the PC authoritarians.

853
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:14,690
Because although they're united by their
tendency to agreeableness,

854
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:15,703
they're not united by other 
temperamental traits nor in their core 

855
00:43:17,871 --> 00:43:19,850
beliefs.
It's the PC authoritarian types.

856
00:43:19,851 --> 00:43:20,684
For example,
we're very obsessed with language 

857
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:23,240
control.
So,

858
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,350
and it's funny that it's agreeableness.
I've really been thinking about that.

859
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:30,050
And the what you know,
again,

860
00:43:30,051 --> 00:43:33,590
this is a hypothesis and development,
but I think what's happening is that,

861
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,400
you know,
you're,

862
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,233
your temperamental proclivity allows you
to lay out a kind of radical 

863
00:43:38,931 --> 00:43:42,300
simplification on the world.
That's part of the advantage of having a

864
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,273
temperament.
So if you're a conscientious person in 

865
00:43:44,441 --> 00:43:46,130
the world is a place to go out there and
work.

866
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:49,070
If you're an open person in the world is
a place to go out there and discover new

867
00:43:49,071 --> 00:43:51,980
ideas and do artistic things.
And if you're an agreeable person,

868
00:43:51,981 --> 00:43:54,810
the world's a place to go out there and 
establish intimate relationships.

869
00:43:54,811 --> 00:43:56,930
And so they're,
they're simplifying

870
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,913
perspectives,
their edit and simplifying 

871
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:02,384
personalities.
They're there or the manner in which 

872
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:07,760
you're adapted to a particular niche.

873
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:10,743
I think what you see in agreeableness in
relationship to political belief is a 

874
00:44:14,621 --> 00:44:15,454
proclivity for people to divide the 
world into defenseless infants and 

875
00:44:19,391 --> 00:44:20,224
predatory oppressors and that that's 
blasted forward onto the political 

876
00:44:23,951 --> 00:44:27,400
landscape and things are conceptualized 
along that temperamental variable.

877
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,970
So anyways,
that's,

878
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:33,690
we're at with regards to the analysis of
political belief.

879
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:35,363
So while we've got three minutes left,
and I'm wondering if anybody has a 

880
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,220
particularly intelligent question or 
failing,

881
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:44,880
not any question at all because I told 
you a lot of things that are,

882
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:48,420
I would say contentious,
but I also think they're very much worth

883
00:44:48,421 --> 00:44:50,470
knowing.
So I'm.

884
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,200
Yes.

885
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,800
You say the
high in agreeableness,

886
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,000
mother infant.

887
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,180
That's what it looks like to me.
Yeah.

888
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,270
Yeah.
Put projected onto the world period.

889
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:05,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

890
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:08,690
What would you say is the best way to go
about

891
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:13,110
knowing that we have the simplified 
world.

892
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:15,923
It's really useful to investigate the 
viewpoints of people who have opposing 

893
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:21,390
views to yours because they'll tell you 
things.

894
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,550
Not only will they tell you things you 
don't know,

895
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:27,120
they'll also tell you how to see the 
world in ways that you don't see it.

896
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:31,530
And they'll also have skills that you 
don't have that you could develop.

897
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,020
So for example,
if you're an introverted person,

898
00:45:34,021 --> 00:45:34,854
it's very useful to watch an extroverted
person because the extroverted person 

899
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:40,380
has ways of being in the social world 
that aren't natural to you,

900
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,020
that you can use this to improve your 
toolkit.

901
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,153
And if you're disagreeable.
One of the best things to do with 

902
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:46,554
disagreeable people,
especially if that's alienating them 

903
00:45:48,721 --> 00:45:49,920
from other people,
for example,

904
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:51,590
because it can,
you know,

905
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:54,690
people treat you like you're a selfish,
arrogant son of a bitch and maybe that's

906
00:45:54,691 --> 00:45:55,980
because you are.
It's like,

907
00:45:55,981 --> 00:45:57,330
okay,
so what do you do about that?

908
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:02,540
One of the,
one of the most promising treatments,

909
00:46:03,181 --> 00:46:06,810
let's say for that is get the person to 
do something for someone else once a day

910
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,300
just as a practice and learn how to do 
it.

911
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,520
Maybe you can wake the circuit up,
you know,

912
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:13,290
if you think that it's lying dormant in 
you,

913
00:46:13,291 --> 00:46:15,030
which is probably right.
You know,

914
00:46:15,031 --> 00:46:18,150
I think we have a very wide range of 
propensity is within us.

915
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,270
Some are switched on,
genetic propensity,

916
00:46:21,271 --> 00:46:22,104
summer switched on,
but I think that if you put yourself in 

917
00:46:23,821 --> 00:46:26,550
the right situation or walk yourself 
through the right exercises,

918
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:28,620
you can switch some of these other 
things on as well.

919
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:31,920
But it takes work and dedication and 
discipline to do it

920
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,210
proactively
for personnel.

921
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:35,850
Yes.

922
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:36,301
Yes.
Well,

923
00:46:36,301 --> 00:46:37,134
I would say generally speaking,
if you want to adapt yourself properly 

924
00:46:39,451 --> 00:46:40,284
to life,
you should find a niche in the 

925
00:46:41,221 --> 00:46:43,170
environment that corresponds with your 
temperament,

926
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:44,833
right?
You shouldn't work at cross purposes to 

927
00:46:46,081 --> 00:46:48,150
your temperament because it's just too 
damn difficult.

928
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:49,283
But having done that,
then you should work on developing the 

929
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,233
skills and viewpoints that exist in the 
space opposite to your personality 

930
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:00,390
because that's where you're 
fundamentally underdeveloped.

931
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:01,523
That way I think you could extend out 
your temperamental capability across a 

932
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:05,574
wider range.
And to me that's roughly equivalent as 

933
00:47:07,771 --> 00:47:10,170
bringing a richer tool kit to each 
situation.

934
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:12,570
You know,
so if you're hyper extroverted,

935
00:47:12,571 --> 00:47:13,404
you should probably learn to shut up at 
parties now and then and listen just to 

936
00:47:15,721 --> 00:47:17,790
see what's going on,
to see if you can manage it,

937
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:19,410
you know,
and if you're introverted,

938
00:47:19,411 --> 00:47:22,320
well then you should learn how to speak 
in public and to,

939
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:23,154
and to learn how to go to parties 
without hiding in the corner and saying 

940
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:26,634
nothing to anyone.

941
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,110
No.
And if you're agreeable,

942
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:28,944
then you need to learn how to be 
disagreeable so people can't push you 

943
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:32,440
around.
And if you're disagreeable,

944
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:34,540
you learn,
you need to learn how to be agreeable so

945
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:36,370
that you're not an evil son of a bitch,
you know,

946
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,713
so,
and the same thing applies even in the 

947
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:42,190
conscientious domain.
It's like if you're too conscientious,

948
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:46,120
you need to learn to relax and let go a 
little bit.

949
00:47:46,121 --> 00:47:51,010
And if you're unconscientious it's time 
like get out the Google calendar man,

950
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,050
and start scheduling your day,
right?

951
00:47:53,051 --> 00:47:53,884
And beat yourself on the back of the 
head with a stick until you're 

952
00:47:55,691 --> 00:47:56,524
disciplined enough so that you can 
actually stick to something for some 

953
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:01,450
length of time and not living in 
absolute squalor,

954
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,553
which is something that would 
characterize someone who's very 

955
00:48:03,851 --> 00:48:05,560
disorderly,
for example,

956
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:06,394
because they just,
they don't notice it doesn't bother 

957
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:09,460
them.

958
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,340
Disorder.
It's like maybe they can see it,

959
00:48:12,341 --> 00:48:14,620
but it doesn't have any emotional 
valence.

960
00:48:14,621 --> 00:48:16,870
And so it doesn't have any motivational 
significance.

961
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,153
Now.
So the other thing you might want to 

962
00:48:19,391 --> 00:48:20,224
think about too,
if you're choosing a partner is try not 

963
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:22,773
to choose someone who's too distant from
you on the temperamental variables 

964
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,390
because you're going to have a hard time
bridging the gap.

965
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,673
You know,
it's hard for an introverted person and 

966
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:31,684
an extroverted person to coexist and 
it's really hard for an orderly person 

967
00:48:34,991 --> 00:48:38,530
and a disorderly person to coexist 
because they will drive each other nuts.

968
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:42,250
Why don't you pick up?
Why are you so obsessed by it?

969
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:44,370
That's the basic argument,
you know,

970
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,273
so.
So it's useful to know about your 

971
00:48:46,991 --> 00:48:47,824
temperament so that you can negotiate 
the space with your partner to wet as 

972
00:48:50,051 --> 00:48:50,884
well and I don't think you should try to
find someone who is exactly the same as 

973
00:48:53,471 --> 00:48:57,940
you because then you don't have the 
benefits of the alternative viewpoint,

974
00:48:58,450 --> 00:48:59,283
but you got to watch it because you may 
hit eric and sizable differences of 

975
00:49:01,781 --> 00:49:02,614
various sorts and I've seen that most 
particularly among couples who are high 

976
00:49:07,001 --> 00:49:08,170
and low in openness.

977
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:11,860
That's a rough one and also high and low
in conscientiousness.

978
00:49:11,861 --> 00:49:12,694
That's another rough one because they 
just cannot see how the other person 

979
00:49:15,941 --> 00:49:18,790
sees the world at at all.
Okay.

980
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:19,900
We'll see you on Tuesday.
