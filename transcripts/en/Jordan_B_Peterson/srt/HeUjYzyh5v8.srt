00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,233
Hello,
I manager Moody and this has big ideas 

2
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,150
and this is a stereogram.
You've probably seen these before.

3
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:22,880
It's a computer generated picture that 
presents a three dimensional image.

4
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:26,030
If you're able to focus your eyes just 
at the right point,

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,493
it takes a while to get the hang of it.
You have to sort of relax and try to 

6
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:30,554
focus just behind the picture and then 
slowly a three dimensional image begins 

7
00:00:34,731 --> 00:00:38,690
to form,
but it doesn't always work and sometimes

8
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:41,510
you're left wondering if the three d 
image is really there at all.

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,033
And according to Jordan Peterson,
a psychologist who teaches at the 

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,193
University of Toronto stereograms are 
analogous to the way that we experience 

11
00:00:51,171 --> 00:00:53,810
reality.
Music is another.

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,933
It is also composed of patterns and 
because music cannot be reduced to 

13
00:00:57,801 --> 00:00:58,634
words,
it conveys a world of meaning beyond 

14
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,144
reason.
Peterson is a psychologist with a 

15
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:06,014
philosophical bend.
He is interested in how we perceive of 

16
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:09,944
things and what we get from it and he 
takes us on a tour to force through 

17
00:01:14,181 --> 00:01:19,181
music and computers.
Painting and chess get ready for a heady

18
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,530
and complex ride.

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,913
Music is a genuine mystery.
Music is one of the experiential 

20
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:28,954
phenomena that we all have access to.
It's like looking into the night sky or 

21
00:01:35,711 --> 00:01:39,910
at the Grand Canyon.
There's something about it that seems to

22
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:44,680
speak about things that are beyond the 
mundane,

23
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,940
and it's an interesting thing that music
can do that because although it has this

24
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,123
arguably transcendental element,
it's also something that's very 

25
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:57,054
accessible to people in general.
It's very rare to find someone who 

26
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:05,031
doesn't like music,
so it's transcendental and universal.

27
00:02:06,671 --> 00:02:11,671
At the same time.
It also seems to me that music

28
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:14,790
okay

29
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:19,790
reliably speaks to people of meaning and
that there are,

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,713
and that the reason that music plays 
such a popular or powerful role in our 

31
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:25,494
culture is because the meaning that 
music speaks of is beyond rational 

32
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:33,360
critique and were very rational and were
very intelligent.

33
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,194
And so we've been able to make 
intellectual hash out of most of the 

34
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:42,630
things that had traditionally offered 
people a grounded sense of meaning.

35
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,040
But because music is beyond rational 
criticism,

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,833
it seems to have been able to retain its
experiential connection with 

37
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:53,064
transcendent meaning despite the fact 
that our rational mind has destroyed 

38
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:57,474
almost everything else.
It's transcendental and part of the 

39
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:00,544
reason I think music can do this is 
precisely because it is beyond either 

40
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:08,761
verbal formulation or verbal criticism.
So if you listen to a song,

41
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,690
whether it has lyrics or not,
could perhaps assume that it doesn't.

42
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,230
It does something to you.
And if someone who had never heard music

43
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,253
asked you what it did,
you couldn't tell them in any way that 

44
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:28,150
was a reasonable summary of the 
experience itself.

45
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,410
I suppose you could consider that 
analogous to trying to describe color to

46
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:33,244
someone who's blind.
Whatever music is about isn't 

47
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:37,984
translatable into language.
Now we can use language to augment our 

48
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:43,740
pleasure in music.
We do that with lyrics constantly,

49
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,703
but

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,750
whatever it is that music speaks of,
if it speaks of something,

51
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:51,090
is not something you can speak of in 
words.

52
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,340
Now,
as rational people,

53
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:56,130
we're also inclined to presume that if 
it's real,

54
00:03:56,131 --> 00:04:00,000
you can speak about it in words,
but there've been culture since the dawn

55
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:00,834
of history believed that there were 
certain things that were not only 

56
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:05,124
unspeakable from a verbal perspective,
but whose meaning was actually 

57
00:04:08,311 --> 00:04:10,770
demolished.
If it was put in words.

58
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,623
For example,
in ancient Hebrew societies and 

59
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,310
incurrent Islam societies,
it's

60
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,093
heretical,
improper to make an image of the 

61
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:29,891
transcendent and the reason for that,
it's not merely an arbitrary moral law.

62
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,890
Nonsensical from a rational perspective.
The reason for that is is

63
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:37,963
some things lose their meaning as soon 
as they're translated into something 

64
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:44,810
that's as tiny as a word and music is 
one of those things,

65
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,323
and I made this little painting here,
it's about seven feet across actually 

66
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,343
when I was a graduate student about 20 
years ago trying to figure out what 

67
00:04:54,831 --> 00:04:57,770
meaning meant and I designed the 
painting.

68
00:04:57,771 --> 00:05:01,400
I'll show you a bigger picture of it 
later to be something that would kind of

69
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,263
move when you looked at it.
If you make a geometrical figure that 

70
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:05,624
sufficiently complex,
then when your brain looks out at it 

71
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:11,360
tries on different fits and it looks to 
your visual perception system as if it's

72
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:12,194
moving a necker cube,
but reversing cube as a simple example 

73
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:16,184
of that.
I want it to make something here that 

74
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,190
moved and danced visually like a,
like a piece of music moves and dances.

75
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,460
That seems to intimate something beyond 
itself.

76
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,530
It's hard to do that with a static 
sculpture.

77
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,660
It's hard to do that with visual arts in
general.

78
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,913
We do seem to approach it to some degree
with a dance and dance is another art 

79
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:37,010
form that speaks of things that are 
beyond words.

80
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,920
That doesn't mean that dance is about 
nothing.

81
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:43,190
It just means that it's about something 
that can't be easily put into words.

82
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,100
Now I actually think you can understand 
what music means,

83
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,173
but there's a real problem in doing it.
And the problem in understanding what 

84
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,020
music means is that it's only sample if 
you change the way you look,

85
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,973
almost everything.
The funny thing is is that music speaks 

86
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:02,990
to you of meaning,
whether you understand it or not,

87
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,200
and that's one of the reasons it's an 
imperishable art.

88
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,470
I think what music speaks to you,
I was real.

89
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,693
In fact,
I think it's more real than anything 

90
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:14,150
else,
but I would also say that's not normally

91
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:16,370
how people think.
Okay,

92
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:17,204
so that's the first part of the spiel.
So I want to tell you some interesting 

93
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:24,190
things about perception.
Now,

94
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,513
here's this problem that's come up in 
the last quarter of the 20th century 

95
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:30,284
that was

96
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:31,520
okay,

97
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,000
formally described by Daniel Dennett 
among others.

98
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,073
It's been something that's been plaguing
people who've been attempting to design 

99
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:41,810
machines that can actually operate in 
the real world.

100
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,310
Early artificial intelligence 
researchers were pretty optimistic about

101
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:49,520
billing things like general purpose 
robots because they believe that

102
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,863
a robot could,
while they believed fundamentally that 

103
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:54,944
the world laid itself out in easily 
accessible objects and that those 

104
00:06:58,671 --> 00:06:59,720
objects had some,

105
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:07,310
some reality beyond their perceptual 
apparent appearance and that the problem

106
00:07:07,321 --> 00:07:08,154
with developing a machine that could 
operate in the real world was only 

107
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,550
determining how it should act,
but it turns out that wasn't right.

108
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,613
It turns out that it's very,
very hard to make a machine that can 

109
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:24,870
perceive,
in fact,

110
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:29,020
it's so hard that it,
it seems technically impossible and that

111
00:07:29,021 --> 00:07:29,854
strange because we can perceive,
but the problem we saw while we proceed 

112
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,740
is so complex that in some ways it 
appears it on computable,

113
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,000
which is why,
by the way,

114
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,400
one of the reasons we don't have general
purpose robots.

115
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,900
It's also why we don't have computers 
that can accurately translate speech.

116
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:46,763
You know,
you're supposed to be able to talk to 

117
00:07:48,271 --> 00:07:49,104
your computer.
People would be promising that for 30 

118
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:51,324
years,
but you can't talk to your computer 

119
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,170
because a computer can't understand what
you're saying.

120
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,363
And the reason for that is it turns out 
it's a very difficult to listen to what 

121
00:07:58,591 --> 00:07:59,424
someone's saying.
And that's partly because all of the 

122
00:08:01,051 --> 00:08:04,260
information is not encoded in the sounds
that they're making.

123
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,573
So for example,
part of the reason you can understand 

124
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:07,884
what I'm saying is that you know,
more or less that this is an s or a 

125
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:12,980
lecture about psychology.
You know,

126
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:13,814
it has a scientific basis.
You know that there are certain things 

127
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:16,824
are not going to talk about.
The entire context within which you sit 

128
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:21,534
informs your understanding of my speech.
And every word I say helps build a 

129
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:29,700
framework for you that informed your 
ability to understand each word computer

130
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:32,250
just can't do that.
Well,

131
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,563
Janet called this the frame problem and 
the frame problem was put in a very 

132
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:40,034
simple way by Medina and Nick Wheeler in
the Mit Encyclopedia of cognitive 

133
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,864
science.
Medina Nagler pointed out that you can 

134
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:49,304
categorize a relatively small finite 
number of objects in virtually an 

135
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:56,370
infinite number of way waves.
And you might think,

136
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:57,204
well,
what does that have to do with looking 

137
00:08:57,811 --> 00:08:59,790
at the world?
And the answer to that is,

138
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,790
well,
perception is a form of categorization.

139
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,880
When you look at something,
you know what that thing is,

140
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,550
your visual system is doing a kind of 
classification.

141
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,270
But it turns out that there's a very 
large number of ways to look at things.

142
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,553
So for example,
right now I'm looking at you as if 

143
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:18,930
you're an audience full of people.
But if I was an impressionist painter,

144
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,913
I could be looking at you as if you were
surfaces from which certain colored 

145
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:24,360
lights were reflecting.

146
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,070
And you might think that that I suppose 
in some way is obvious.

147
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:33,210
But it's useful to remember that when 
the impressionists had their first shows

148
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:34,044
in Paris basing their artistic 
production on this transformation of 

149
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:39,540
perception,
they caused riots.

150
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,213
All right?
So perception is a very difficult 

151
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:45,480
process and artists actually teach us 
how to see.

152
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:46,643
And I don't mean that in again,
I don't mean that in some impractical 

153
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,080
way.
I mean that the way we use our eyes is,

154
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:56,550
has been informed from for hundreds of 
thousands of years,

155
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:57,384
perhaps by the experts among us who were
able to use their visual systems better 

156
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:04,050
than anyone else and who could 
communicate that.

157
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,870
It's hard to see the world.
While you can think of that,

158
00:10:09,871 --> 00:10:11,820
if you're playing chess,
you know,

159
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,163
we had to build big computers to beat 
Grand Masters at chess and they can 

160
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:17,550
barely do it.
And that's all they can do,

161
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:17,850
right?

162
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,683
Big Blue plays chess,
but it can't walk down the street and 

163
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:21,264
it's not good at riding a bicycle.
So one purpose machine and the way it 

164
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,820
plays chess isn't the way that people 
play chess.

165
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,863
It plays chess by doing a reasonably 
exhaustive search of every single 

166
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:33,000
combination.
And on a chess board,

167
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:38,001
there's an unbelievably large number of 
potential combinations of moves.

168
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,163
It's immense.
And a chess game is a rather bounded 

169
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:44,820
world and all things considered,
there's a finite number of men.

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,980
They have finite rules,
but nonetheless,

171
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:49,420
it's an unbelievably complex,
uh,

172
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,710
environment in terms of its space of 
possibilities.

173
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,783
Expert chess players appear to identify 
configurations of men that have some 

174
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,710
relevance.
So what they're able to do is to look at

175
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:02,544
the board and rapidly determine what 
they should pay attention to and what 

176
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:05,904
they shouldn't pay attention to.
And they develop that skill by 

177
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,910
practicing over thousands of games and 
studying chess games and so forth and so

178
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:12,450
on.

179
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,283
We don't duplicate that with a computer.
And so what you could say is that an 

180
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:22,371
expert chess player is an expert at 
being able to see a chest board and they

181
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:25,530
see extremely well.
And then once they've seen,

182
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:26,364
they can kind of put constraints around 
the cognitive complexity of the problem 

183
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:30,414
and operate within that.
While you guys are doing that all the 

184
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:33,354
time when you look at the world,
but there's so much of your brain 

185
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:37,840
devoted to it.
And you're so bloody good at it that you

186
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,290
don't even know what's happening.
And when you look at the world it's like

187
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,124
there it is and that's all objective and
obvious and there's the objects and you 

188
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:47,100
know they have nothing to do with your 
perception,

189
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:52,101
but it is absolutely not that clear and 
it's not clear for a lot of reasons.

190
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:54,490
I mean one is the frame problem.

191
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,880
The other is that it turns out that when
you look at the world,

192
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,643
you don't see objects and then think 
about them and then figure out how to 

193
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:02,494
act.
Your eyes map on all sorts of parts of 

194
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:06,190
your body.
So for example,

195
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,323
the,
your retinas map right onto your spinal 

196
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:12,520
cord and that means your eyes can make 
your body move without eat with you,

197
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,710
without you thinking.
And without you seeing.

198
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,053
That's a pretty weird thing.
It's hard to understand it until you 

199
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:18,874
understand that what your retina is 
doing is picking up patterns cause it's 

200
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:23,800
like a matrix,
right?

201
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:24,634
It's like a TV screen.
It picks up patterns from outside world 

202
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,430
and then it translates them into 
patterns of motor output.

203
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,130
There's no intermediation of perception 
whatsoever.

204
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:33,964
If you're moving very quickly and there 
can't be because it takes you too long 

205
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:38,350
to see anything to be fast.

206
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,633
That's why by the way,
when you drive down the road in your 

207
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:41,884
car,
you don't look right in front of the 

208
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:43,504
hood.
That's what good is that if you see it 

209
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,530
in front of the hood,
you've already run over it.

210
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,633
You have to look like half a second down
the road because anything that happens 

211
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:53,200
to you closer than that,
it's already too late.

212
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,513
So you look far enough down the road so 
that you can get your body to do what 

213
00:12:57,761 --> 00:13:01,810
you wanted to do and take into account 
how long it takes you to see the world,

214
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:05,020
which may be up to half a second.
I mean that's one estimate.

215
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:05,854
I think that's too long,
but that's the standard estimate app at 

216
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:09,184
the time for half a second to long time,
you go 40 feet in a car going 60 miles 

217
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,624
an hour and half a second.
The point I'm making there is that when 

218
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:21,790
you see the object,
the seeing produces the action.

219
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,960
So,
for example,

220
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,063
you have a little mechanism and your 
motor system that allows you to grab 

221
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:30,430
things and you practice the hell out of 
that when you were two years old,

222
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:31,810
right?
You're just grabbing things left,

223
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:36,100
right and center til you got the grip 
motion down to an automated state.

224
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,630
Well,
if you look at a cup,

225
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,560
the act of looking at the cuff reduces 
the threshold for activation of the grip

226
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:46,030
mechanism.
And that doesn't because you see the cup

227
00:13:46,031 --> 00:13:47,350
and then you think,
I'll pick it up.

228
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,600
It happens as a consequence of seeing 
it.

229
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,090
And it turns out that when you're 
looking at the world,

230
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,283
you don't see objects exactly what you 
see is things that it's useful to 

231
00:13:57,281 --> 00:14:00,520
interact with.
And those things are more like tools.

232
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,743
And so I would say,
well you're looking in this room and 

233
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,384
what you see are things to interact with
and you think those are objective 

234
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,070
objects,
but they're really not.

235
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,530
Or maybe they are.
But there are very,

236
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:12,364
very,
very tiny subset of all the objects you 

237
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:15,184
could see in this room.
Someone like a schizophrenia whose 

238
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:19,870
perceptions of being somewhat 
fragmented.

239
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,093
They have a hard time focusing on the 
universal class of usable objects that 

240
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:26,104
everybody looks at.
And so a schizophrenia and sometimes an 

241
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:31,950
artist too can get lost in contemplation
of the complex patterns in the,

242
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,873
in the carpet or the shades of colors 
that are in the person's shirt next to 

243
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:39,100
you or all these complex things that you
can see around you,

244
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:41,170
but that you pay no attention to 
whatsoever.

245
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,490
How do you ignore all that?
You ignore almost everything.

246
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,520
99.9 and far more percent of everything 
that's around you.

247
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,943
You don't see,
you see relevant things and we really 

248
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:57,290
don't know how you do it.
Uh,

249
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,220
you know already how complex a chest 
king,

250
00:14:59,221 --> 00:15:00,054
yes,
now uncomfortable that is yet you're 

251
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:03,084
interacting with an environment who's 
complexity leaves a chess game in the 

252
00:15:06,001 --> 00:15:08,730
dusk.
You're environment is composed of an,

253
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,893
an infinite number of hierarchically 
stacked chess games and yet you wander 

254
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:16,800
through it without a second thought,
unless something goes wrong.

255
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,010
It turns out that perception is the hard
part.

256
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:21,983
Now,
artists have always known this and you 

257
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:27,300
get modern artists like believe that 
some agreed

258
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,543
on the right,

259
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,863
the greed is telling you that the 
average person is blinded by their 

260
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,850
presuppositions,
right?

261
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:41,990
That's what that painting needs and the 
visual illusion on the left,

262
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,153
which was,
which was constructed by a perceptual 

263
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:46,154
scientist shows that shows how with 
knowledge of the visual system you can 

264
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:52,250
play games with it and the game there 
is,

265
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:53,683
well what is that exactly?
Is it an amalgam of lines or is it a 

266
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,960
square in the middle of a diamond?
Well,

267
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:03,620
I would say it's both of those and then 
what it is to depends on what it is that

268
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:04,850
you would do with it.
Well,

269
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:06,740
you don't do anything with that except 
look at it,

270
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:08,930
but your visual system doesn't know 
that.

271
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,873
Okay.

272
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,390
Stu Shah on the left new descending a 
staircase.

273
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:19,050
Well why is that a new descending a 
staircase?

274
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,440
While you may be able to see it and you 
may not be able to see it.

275
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:23,274
But what it is is that it's the,
it's the geometric figure of a human 

276
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:32,031
being with the fourth dimension averaged
averaged across the fourth dimension.

277
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,043
Fourth dimension is time.
What you see is the nude transformed 

278
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:42,480
into a geometric figure at each point of
the descent down the staircase.

279
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:43,801
Now you might say,
well,

280
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:45,750
that's not a realist painting.
And I would say,

281
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:47,610
well,
don't be so sure about that.

282
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,610
Abstraction sometimes is more real than 
reality,

283
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,820
or do you think that numbers are less 
real than things?

284
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,523
While I tell you,
you can do a lot of things with numbers 

285
00:16:56,911 --> 00:17:00,180
you can't do with things,
and you could argue that the numbers are

286
00:17:00,181 --> 00:17:01,380
more real than the things.

287
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,030
And I could say,
well,

288
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,223
that's more real than what you see 
because you can't see time across 

289
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,510
sequences.
You only see it in slices.

290
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:14,400
And that's across sequences.
And then there's Picasso on the left.

291
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,510
And part of what Picasso was doing,
apart from playing with time and angle,

292
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,890
was trying to determine just how badly 
you could mangle and decompose.

293
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:23,990
Uh,
um,

294
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,993
an iconic image and still be able to 
recognize it as an image and it turns 

295
00:17:28,051 --> 00:17:28,884
out,
well,

296
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,750
there's not a single thing in that 
painting that's reminiscent of a face.

297
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:38,280
It's the gestalt that does it and you 
have a specialized system in your brain.

298
00:17:38,281 --> 00:17:39,114
It's attached to your emotional systems 
in an area called the Amygdala that 

299
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:42,444
partly deals with fear.
That is a specialized phase detector 

300
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,580
system.
And it's so specialized that if you turn

301
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:48,414
faces upside down,
it about 60 or 70% of its ability to 

302
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:52,684
discriminate.

303
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,603
It's really specialized.
You look at people in their faces pop 

304
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:56,940
out and you think,
man,

305
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:58,860
there's so much difference between 
phases.

306
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,860
There's not that much difference at all 
objectively speaking,

307
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:02,694
and it's certainly possible for you to 
have have a stroke that will leave you 

308
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:06,534
almost entirely intellectually and 
perceptually intact and yet be 

309
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,150
absolutely unable to tell one face from 
another.

310
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,780
Well on the bottom left,
I guess that's a little girl.

311
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,031
Well,
how,

312
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:19,250
how is it that you can know that?
Well,

313
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,160
it's partly because the castle has 
taught you to see things like that,

314
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,263
but also because your visual system is 
unbelievably good at producing rapid 

315
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:29,250
abstractions.
Think about it this way.

316
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,910
You know those simple drawings that kids
make of stick figures?

317
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,760
Those aren't simple,
right?

318
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:38,070
Because a stick figure,
it doesn't look anything like a person.

319
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,533
In fact,
it looks about as unlike the person has 

320
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,380
anything possibly could and still be a 
person.

321
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,140
The thing that's so interesting about a 
kid stick figures,

322
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:46,974
it gives you insight into the tremendous
ability of them to abstract away from 

323
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,060
reality,
right?

324
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:54,750
And they're really not images at all.
They're like Harold glyphs.

325
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:55,584
They're quasi linguistic representations
because you know a stick figures the 

326
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:02,430
next best thing to,
to a written symbol kids,

327
00:19:02,431 --> 00:19:05,310
they just generate those nonstop house.
This is a house.

328
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,290
It's got some smoke coming out of it,
right?

329
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,050
You recognize that house in no time,
flat kid,

330
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:12,390
three years old,
four years old can spin one of those off

331
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:13,224
in no time flat.
Their perceptual systems are 

332
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:15,864
unbelievably sophisticated and they do 
not merely map self evidence objects 

333
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,353
onto the cognitive system.
Perception doesn't work like that at 

334
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,910
all.
It's difficult to overemphasize.

335
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:29,120
Yeah.
I nude

336
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,880
to people on a beach grief.
Oh,

337
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,450
that's a really interesting one.
Hey,

338
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,210
you can just nail that as grief in no 
time flat.

339
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,000
Why?
While the color death,

340
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:45,200
green and purple,
I don't know what he did with the eyes.

341
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:47,720
Why it manages.
It's a wellness appears like a tour,

342
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:49,160
I think,
and this of course,

343
00:19:49,161 --> 00:19:49,994
it's a handkerchief.
It's a striking image and so mangled 

344
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:57,050
that it's almost beyond recognition.
Nonetheless.

345
00:19:57,051 --> 00:20:01,010
You can categorize it from an emotional 
perspective and no time flat.

346
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,970
What's that?
To delve nation.

347
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,200
There's the head.
Do you see it?

348
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,210
There's the leg,
here's the leg.

349
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,970
There's the back of it.
Does everybody see the Dalmatian?

350
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,760
How many people see it?
It's there,

351
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,170
right?
How many people don't see it?

352
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,110
Well,
is it there or not?

353
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:32,490
Call her head shadow leaves background 
sidewalk.

354
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,433
Once you get it,
you can't not see it if you don't get 

355
00:20:38,211 --> 00:20:39,830
it.
If you don't grip it as it gets stalled.

356
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,660
What is it?
Random patterns.

357
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,240
While they're not random,
but that's only because you had,

358
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,370
you're familiar with dogs and living 
things.

359
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,980
That's as of a random pattern is 
anything you could generate deceptive.

360
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:54,990
It also happens to be a dog.
How do we see things?

361
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,430
And that's a really good question.
It's really hard to answer.

362
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,120
Partly we limit our vision,
we see through a lens,

363
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,830
it's hard to describe what this lens is.
It's,

364
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:07,664
it's the lens that allows us to use our 
intuitions about a situation to specify 

365
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:12,964
the meaning of the current moment.
So imagine you're reading a book and 

366
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:17,920
then you think,
well how do you read that book?

367
00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:20,740
Exactly.
You read it letter by letter,

368
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,800
what little kids do,
but they don't like to read.

369
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,720
And that's because they have to read 
letter by letter.

370
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,793
You read a book,
letter by letter and see how much 

371
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:30,040
enjoyment you get out of it,
right?

372
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,143
So you get the letters automated,
you build a little machine in the back 

373
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:35,860
of your mind that nails those letters 
and then common combinations.

374
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:36,694
And then you can read word by word and 
then you automate that with several 

375
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,130
thousand hours of practice until you're 
so good at that.

376
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,380
When you look at a word you can't help 
but read.

377
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:47,980
It just goes off in your head like the 
word is in the outside world.

378
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,323
Then if you keep practicing,
you see phrases and if you're really 

379
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:55,450
good you start to see sentences.
But you get pretty speedy at that point.

380
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:56,763
Okay,
so then the question is when you're 

381
00:21:57,701 --> 00:21:58,534
reading a book,
do you read it phrase by phrase or 

382
00:22:00,011 --> 00:22:01,750
sentence by sentence and sentence?

383
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,610
And the answer to that is,
well no,

384
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:05,890
not exactly.
You read it,

385
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,970
you read the word,
you read the phrase,

386
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,970
you read the sentence,
you read the paragraph,

387
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,850
you read the chapter,
you read the book,

388
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,610
you know the cover,
you know the culture,

389
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,563
you know the intent of the author.
And all of those things are going on 

390
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:25,870
simultaneously while you're trying to 
extract meaning out of that book.

391
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:31,260
So it's as if you're looking at the word
through a lens made up of the success of

392
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:32,134
layers of knowledge that you have that 
allow you to zero in on the meaning of 

393
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:38,800
what it is that the author is attempting
to explain.

394
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:39,700
And then you think,
well,

395
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,790
what does,
so think about how someone translates.

396
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:43,624
You can't do it word by word.
He can't do it phrase by phrase it 

397
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:48,850
letter by letter,
we'll just forget it and you can't get a

398
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:50,110
computer to translate.

399
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,393
Why?
Well it's because when you read 

400
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:53,644
something,
you figure out what it means and then 

401
00:22:55,661 --> 00:22:58,570
you translate it so that it also means 
that the next language,

402
00:22:58,571 --> 00:23:02,680
so it's as if the verbal,
the verbal level,

403
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,180
verbal portrayal is one motive,
reality perception,

404
00:23:07,181 --> 00:23:08,014
but it translates onto another mode and 
that mode is meaning and then it can be 

405
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,393
back translated into another lane.
And that's how a good translator does 

406
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:16,024
it.
And that's also white translation is an 

407
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:17,381
art,
right?

408
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:19,270
I mean,
did you get the meaning?

409
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:21,580
Right?
Well who knows if it's a philosopher,

410
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:23,740
I mean philosophers mean a lot of 
different things.

411
00:23:23,741 --> 00:23:24,574
At the same time.
Question is what's the level of reality 

412
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,450
down at which to you translate the 
words?

413
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:32,883
Well,
it seems to have something to do with 

414
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,970
movement and action and behavioral 
output.

415
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,060
It seems to have something to do with 
the fact that we have a body.

416
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,493
It isn't a merely intellectual exercise 
because when you read something and it 

417
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:46,070
has meaning,
you think,

418
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,510
I know what that means and what that 
means is having read this,

419
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,130
I know how to do something differently,
or I know how to conceptualize something

420
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:58,360
differently so that my actions will be 
different in the future.

421
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,650
That's why we generally say if it's 
fiction,

422
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:04,190
say that it has a moral right.
There's a behavioral consequence.

423
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,530
There's a,
that's what the meaning of the story is.

424
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:07,880
That's the point.
You know,

425
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:08,714
we can get the point.
That means that while you either do 

426
00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:15,110
something differently or you perceive 
and then act generally differently,

427
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,820
and if it's really meaningful,
you say,

428
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:18,230
well,
that changed my life.

429
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:22,670
Or what does that mean?
I no longer see things the same way.

430
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,130
That's as close to literal truth as you 
lead,

431
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,380
you know,
I no longer think the same.

432
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:29,330
Things are important.
Well,

433
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,253
it's important things to which you 
devote your action and if the thing is 

434
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:34,064
powerfully meaningful,
then it transforms the manner in which 

435
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:39,070
you act and the aims towards which you 
act.

436
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,273
That's meaningful.
Now our lens has help us specify 

437
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:44,204
meaning,

438
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,663
well,

439
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,623
you know your lenses give you all sorts 
of different takes on the world and you 

440
00:24:52,021 --> 00:24:55,410
might think,
well are those takes real?

441
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,050
And I would say,
well,

442
00:24:58,051 --> 00:25:00,330
here's the odd thing.
They are real,

443
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,283
but any visual landscape is so complex 
that you can derive a very large number 

444
00:25:06,361 --> 00:25:09,030
of real representations up.
So I could say,

445
00:25:09,031 --> 00:25:12,030
well,
here's a low resolution photograph real.

446
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,220
Is it more or less real than a high 
resolution photograph?

447
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,810
What if it's black and white?
Is that less or more real than color?

448
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,630
What if it's three dimensional instead 
of two dementia?

449
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,480
What if it's abstracted,
et Cetera,

450
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,314
et cetera.
You can imagine how many photographs of 

451
00:25:26,611 --> 00:25:28,740
a single object you could conceivably 
take.

452
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,873
They're all slices of what that thing is
or their representational slices of our 

453
00:25:34,381 --> 00:25:36,660
conceptions of what it is and they're 
all valid.

454
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:39,480
There's a large number of valid 
interpretations.

455
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:40,883
You know,
it's a funny thing because the 

456
00:25:41,281 --> 00:25:44,010
humanities ran into the frame problem.
Hey,

457
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,263
the humanities run into their frame 
problem with postmodernism because the 

458
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:52,650
postmodern is starting to become aware 
of the fact that if you took a book,

459
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,173
there was no end to the number of 
interpretations you could derive from 

460
00:25:56,251 --> 00:25:58,680
it.
And so the postmodern start,

461
00:25:58,681 --> 00:26:03,681
well then anything goes.
No techs have any intrinsic meaning.

462
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:05,363
Well,
I don't think that's true for a variety 

463
00:26:06,391 --> 00:26:07,680
of reasons,
but it was certainly,

464
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,783
uh,
appropriate inference given what they 

465
00:26:10,561 --> 00:26:11,394
had discovered.
If you can't specify the meaning of a 

466
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:14,364
text,
how can you be sure that it has any 

467
00:26:15,751 --> 00:26:18,630
meaning at all?
Very hard question.

468
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,990
Well,
it turns out that at least in part,

469
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,350
meaning is dependent on the Lens.
So we can imagine this,

470
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,300
imagine that this is what the world's 
like.

471
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:33,780
It's an infinite hierarchical landscape,
not about objects but of patterns.

472
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,920
And some of those patterns are objects,
patterns that persist,

473
00:26:38,921 --> 00:26:39,754
for example,
or patterns that persists that are 

474
00:26:41,741 --> 00:26:43,800
useful.
So if I to you will,

475
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,260
what's a chair?
And you say,

476
00:26:46,261 --> 00:26:47,094
well,
a chair has four legs and a seat and a 

477
00:26:48,451 --> 00:26:49,261
back.
And I say,

478
00:26:49,261 --> 00:26:49,711
well,
no,

479
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:53,150
a stump doesn't have any of those and 
neither does a bean bag,

480
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,620
but they're both chairs.
And so then you say,

481
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:56,940
well,
it's a chair.

482
00:26:56,941 --> 00:26:58,680
If you can sit on it.
And I say,

483
00:26:58,681 --> 00:27:03,030
well you can sit on a table and it turns
out the defining what a chair is,

484
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:04,920
no easy thing.
Even though you know one,

485
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:08,340
when you see one,
well imagine this,

486
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,740
the world's made out of patterns.

487
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,610
And those patterns can be interpreted in
a very large number of ways.

488
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:18,840
But it's more complicated than that 
because your mind is made up of patterns

489
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:19,674
too.
And when you take your mind in the 

490
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:22,764
patterns that are in your mind and you 
apply them to the world than what you 

491
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:27,474
get is an interaction between the 
patterns that the world are made out of 

492
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,880
is made out of,
and the patterns that your mind are made

493
00:27:32,881 --> 00:27:35,970
out of.
And that's an even more complex pattern.

494
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,970
And it has something to do with reality 
as such.

495
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,280
But it also has something to do with 
you.

496
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,323
And then I would say,
well the reality is actually in the 

497
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:46,410
interaction between the two sets of 
patterns.

498
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,453
And I don't mean that metaphysically.
I mean the reality is in the 

499
00:27:51,571 --> 00:27:53,910
interactions between the two sets of 
patterns.

500
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,540
And so when I said if you want to 
understand what music means,

501
00:27:57,541 --> 00:27:59,910
you have to change the way that you 
think about things.

502
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,953
What I mean is that what music speaks of
is a way of understanding reality that 

503
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:09,150
is not like the way we understand 
reality and yet it's a way,

504
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,630
it's a way that even when merely 
intimated,

505
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,613
which is what music does,
it grips people powerfully at in a way 

506
00:28:16,051 --> 00:28:16,884
that cannot be irrationally criticized.
Unless you say that the meaning that 

507
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:20,814
music speaks of is not real well then I 
would say it depends on your definition 

508
00:28:25,561 --> 00:28:29,190
of reality and you know there's lots of 
ways to play that game.

509
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,713
You know,
you can define thing a or thing B as 

510
00:28:32,941 --> 00:28:35,910
real or out of reality in a variety of 
different ways.

511
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,300
Well you have to make choices about what
you decided is real.

512
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,134
Right.
That's why philosophers since time in 

513
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:44,460
memorial have pointed out that like it 
or not,

514
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:49,461
your existence is grounded in faith.
Now what's your lens like?

515
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,000
I can tell you what my lens is like.
Imagine I'm writing a paper,

516
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:56,150
which I do fairly often.
Um,

517
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,710
why do I write the paper?
Well,

518
00:28:58,711 --> 00:28:59,544
let's make it simpler.
Why do I write the sentence while I 

519
00:29:02,101 --> 00:29:02,934
write the sentence to contribute to the 
paragraph and I read the paragraph to 

520
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:07,074
contribute to the essay and I write the 
essay to contribute to the paper and I 

521
00:29:10,021 --> 00:29:10,854
write the paper because it's part of 
being a scientist and I am a scientist 

522
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:17,190
because it's part of being a professor 
and I'm a professor because it's part of

523
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,173
least in principle,
being a good citizen and being a good 

524
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:25,050
citizen has a definition in a,
in a Judeo Christian capitalist society,

525
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:29,150
being a good citizen is being a Judeo 
Christian capitalist for better,

526
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,110
for worse.
Hey,

527
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,703
and so when I'm,
even when I'm engaged in something as 

528
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:39,990
potentially trivial is writing a single 
sentence in an essay,

529
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,270
all of those sources of knowledge bear 
on it simultaneously.

530
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,310
And that's what helps me specify its 
meaning.

531
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,840
And you can't say that any one of those 
levels of analysis is more real than any

532
00:29:49,841 --> 00:29:50,674
other.
Now you can say it's more pragmatically 

533
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:56,440
worthwhile to focus on a certain level 
at a certain point in time.

534
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,573
But I'll tell you if I,
if I get a paper that's rejected badly 

535
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:02,350
enough,
which happens fairly often,

536
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,970
I don't start thinking,
well,

537
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,823
the sentence was wrong.
I started thinking I'm a pretty awful 

538
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:10,690
scientist and therefore I must not be a 
very good professor.

539
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:13,990
And that puts the whole productive 
science citizen thing in doubt.

540
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:14,843
And you think hard about that for a bit.
And you'll understand real quick why 

541
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:21,310
people don't like other people who mess 
around with their presuppositions,

542
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,683
right?
Because it goes pretty quickly up the 

543
00:30:23,951 --> 00:30:27,760
old reality hierarchy from you have a 
stupid idea to your,

544
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,623
you know,
your,

545
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:33,280
your moral grip on your privileged 
position is,

546
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,170
uh,
unjustifiable.

547
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,840
Well,
let's take a simple lent.

548
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:38,883
Okay?
How do you look at the world while 

549
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:41,314
you're a motivated creature and you're 
alive and you're always doing something 

550
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:44,883
fiddling around with something.
You know when in the old Mesopotamian 

551
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:50,590
creation myths that God is who lived 
underneath everything.

552
00:30:50,591 --> 00:30:51,424
She'd always come up in a terribly 
destructive rourke as people were 

553
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:57,580
running around on the planet doing 
things in disturbing here.

554
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,230
While we still believe that,
right?

555
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:02,500
Because we believe if we mess around 
with the environment long enough,

556
00:31:02,501 --> 00:31:04,930
so all hell's gonna break clicks,
but you know,

557
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:06,730
we're always running around messing 
things up.

558
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,780
That's what we do,
right?

559
00:31:07,781 --> 00:31:10,690
We're going from point a to point B and 
you know how it is.

560
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,040
You have a goal,
you pursue it,

561
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,080
get the goal.
As soon as you get the goal,

562
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:15,790
you have another goal and you pursue 
that.

563
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,993
As you get that,
it says if this roll the rock up the 

564
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:21,640
hill,
rolls down the hill,

565
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,470
roll it up,
the hill was down the hill,

566
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,020
eventually get tired of that and you 
die.

567
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,880
You're stuck in one of these,
hey,

568
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:31,714
and it gives your life value because it 
turns out that the way your emotional 

569
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:37,120
systems work is that they only worked if
you have a goal.

570
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,760
So you have a goal,
whatever that is,

571
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:44,950
and then anything that happens to you 
that puts you closer to the goal,

572
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,330
that makes you happy and it turns on 
your systems that make you go ahead,

573
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,193
move forward,
be attracted to anything that gets in 

574
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:56,290
the way of your goal.
Depending on its

575
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,660
potency,
produces negative emotion,

576
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,250
anxiety,
frustration,

577
00:32:03,251 --> 00:32:04,300
disappointment,
shame,

578
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,163
guilt,
anger stops you or makes you move 

579
00:32:07,781 --> 00:32:08,614
backwards.
You're a pretty simple creature in some 

580
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:11,920
ways,
you're going somewhere.

581
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,893
If things are going well,
you're happy because happy means things 

582
00:32:17,381 --> 00:32:20,320
are going well in progression to a goal.
And if they aren't,

583
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,420
you're not happy.
Forward.

584
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:24,940
Stop.
Reverse forward is happy.

585
00:32:24,941 --> 00:32:26,800
Stopped is anxious,
reverses,

586
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,420
frustration,
disappointment,

587
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,343
pain.
We're linear creatures and we're always 

588
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:34,270
on the move and we look at the world 
through a motivated led's,

589
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,370
right?
This isn't secondary.

590
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,160
It's not after perception.
It informs perception,

591
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:44,600
which means really that you can't look 
at the world without wanting something.

592
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,973
And which also means that the way the 
world looks to you depends what you 

593
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:51,800
want.
That's a scary thought.

594
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,040
What you see when you're looking at the 
world,

595
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,020
well,
you see,

596
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,590
they're not objects they've been called 
affordances.

597
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,650
You see things that have relevance to 
you.

598
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,423
Well,

599
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,480
I think it has to persist a bit for it 
to be relevant to you.

600
00:33:09,481 --> 00:33:12,900
So a lot of the things that we see our 
objects,

601
00:33:12,901 --> 00:33:14,250
but not everything.
There's one,

602
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,510
here's an ad hoc category.
Firemen can see this,

603
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,733
but other people can't.
Things to take out of your apartment 

604
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:26,220
while it's burning down.
Okay?

605
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:27,350
Now that's a category,
right?

606
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,490
You can even imagine that as a 
perceptual category,

607
00:33:29,491 --> 00:33:32,880
but the thing is that it contains share 
virtually no objective features,

608
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,880
pets,
spouses,

609
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:41,120
probably
things of sentimental value money.

610
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:47,900
Well then maybe the list gets more 
difficult to define,

611
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,030
but you understand,
you'll see that the goal there,

612
00:33:50,031 --> 00:33:53,270
which is to get out of the apartment 
before you die with some things of value

613
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,650
to what you see and you may object.
I wouldn't actually see that.

614
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,060
And I would say,
Oh yeah,

615
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:01,310
you would.
If you're looking at a bowl of fruit and

616
00:34:01,311 --> 00:34:03,920
it has three bananas and two apples in 
an orange unit.

617
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,070
And I asked you what that is and you say
it's a bowl of fruit.

618
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,520
Why you see his fruit,
not two apples and whatever.

619
00:34:10,521 --> 00:34:12,740
I mentioned two bananas,
two apples and the peach.

620
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,550
You see fruit,
you see what you categorize or

621
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,123
opposite.

622
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,173
You categorize when you see she moving 
along from where you are to where you 

623
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:24,764
want to go.
And you parse the world up into useful 

624
00:34:27,171 --> 00:34:28,850
things that get you to where you want to
go.

625
00:34:28,851 --> 00:34:29,684
And knowing things that don't.
And if everything works out fine while 

626
00:34:35,111 --> 00:34:37,260
you get here,
then you have a new one.

627
00:34:37,261 --> 00:34:38,094
If he's

628
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,380
but there's a catch.
Now here's the catch.

629
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,870
When you look at the world,
you hardly see anything that's there.

630
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:51,243
You know you're simplifying things,
but everything that you don't see is 

631
00:34:53,231 --> 00:34:54,064
still there.
So imagine that you're inhabiting this 

632
00:34:56,411 --> 00:35:01,411
little sort of simplified and somewhat 
perfected domain all the time.

633
00:35:01,721 --> 00:35:03,290
It's wandering around you.
It's,

634
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:04,960
it's,
it's part of what you inhabit.

635
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:06,380
But the real world,
whatever that is,

636
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:10,810
is out there.
I've often thought about the story of in

637
00:35:10,811 --> 00:35:11,644
Genesis,
you know the story of Adam and eve in 

638
00:35:12,851 --> 00:35:14,650
that regard,
because what you have there is a kind of

639
00:35:14,651 --> 00:35:17,170
paradise where everything's really going
well.

640
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,243
And you know,
you've all lived in a pair of dice like 

641
00:35:19,181 --> 00:35:21,040
that when things were going really well,
right?

642
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,410
But there's always snakes in those 
paradises.

643
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,460
And the reason for that is just because 
things are going well,

644
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:28,294
it doesn't mean you've accounted for 
everything and you can't account for 

645
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:32,260
everything.

646
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,530
So there's always something lurking 
around from underneath.

647
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:36,663
And if you go and mess with thing,
then all hell breaks loose and you 

648
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:41,791
think,
well,

649
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:43,230
has that ever happened to you?
Well,

650
00:35:43,231 --> 00:35:44,064
sure happens to you.
If you have a relationship and the 

651
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,900
person you're having a relationship with
cheats on you,

652
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,590
that's a snake for sure.
It happens to you.

653
00:35:52,591 --> 00:35:55,860
If you're well and then you're not,
it happens to you if you're dependent on

654
00:35:55,861 --> 00:35:58,080
a family member and they'd die,
right?

655
00:35:58,081 --> 00:36:03,060
It's the unrevealed complexity of the 
world that manifests itself.

656
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:06,660
Suddenly that wreaks havoc on our little
paradises.

657
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,600
Well,
and we're so damn curious,

658
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:11,820
hey,
we just can't leave well enough alone.

659
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,650
That's human beings for sure,
right?

660
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:16,380
Just like the Catholics say,
heritable sit,

661
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,453
right?
You put people into paradise and you 

662
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,480
tell them not to do one thing and you 
can bloody well be sugar.

663
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:24,210
That's the first thing they're going to 
do because we're so curious.

664
00:36:24,211 --> 00:36:25,044
We cannot leave things a little.
We're always unraveling sweaters and 

665
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,420
looking at things we're not supposed to 
look at.

666
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,250
So on and so forth.
And you know,

667
00:36:32,251 --> 00:36:35,310
it's a great thing and we learned a lot,
but we pay a big price for it.

668
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,230
The question is

669
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,460
what do you look at when you don't know 
what you see?

670
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,880
What is it that you see when you don't 
know what you see?

671
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,710
So think about it this way.
This is a very,

672
00:36:48,711 --> 00:36:53,120
very hard thing to understand.
Remember when the towers fell?

673
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,600
What did you see?
Why you say,

674
00:36:56,601 --> 00:36:57,950
well,
I saw the towers fall and I said,

675
00:36:57,951 --> 00:36:58,221
no,
no,

676
00:36:58,221 --> 00:37:00,800
no.
If all you saw was that the towers fell,

677
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,720
you wouldn't have looked at it.
50 types.

678
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:07,550
Why did you have to look at it 50 times 
or cause you couldn't believe it?

679
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,893
What did that mean?
It meant that the event was so complex 

680
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:15,320
that you couldn't perceive it.
What fell?

681
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:17,803
Uh,
the monetary system in the u s the 

682
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:20,960
Western economy,

683
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,660
it was the transformation of the Cold 
War,

684
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,880
uh,
was a new paradigm.

685
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,783
Um,
it was a battle between good and evil 

686
00:37:32,511 --> 00:37:34,460
that popped up pretty quick.
Like the next day,

687
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:35,294
pretty much.
You had to look at it over and over and 

688
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,020
over and over because he didn't know 
what you were seeing.

689
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,570
He didn't know how to see what you were 
seeing and you think,

690
00:37:41,571 --> 00:37:42,830
okay,
I don't quite get that.

691
00:37:42,831 --> 00:37:43,880
And then I would think,
okay,

692
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,240
when you're driving your car and it 
breaks down,

693
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,100
what is it?
When it breaks down?

694
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,443
And you might say it's a car.
And I would say if you persist on 

695
00:37:53,301 --> 00:37:55,640
thinking that that thing that isn't 
moving as a car,

696
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,653
you're going to have nothing but 
frustration because what it is now is a 

697
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,010
very complex assemblage of parts you 
don't understand.

698
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,550
One of which is key to transforming it 
back into a car.

699
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,743
And so what happens is that it reveals 
itself suddenly as a consequence of its 

700
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:13,334
noncompliance with your wishes as the 
complex structured entity that it 

701
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:17,774
actually is.
You have to go pay a mechanic because 

702
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:21,434
the mechanic knows the magic sequence 
that will turn this intransigent bit of 

703
00:38:25,251 --> 00:38:26,084
complex junk back into the simple thing 
that you can drive to work well and 

704
00:38:29,781 --> 00:38:31,500
you'll pay for that,
right?

705
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:32,334
Because it's valuable because for you to
get that thing back to being in a car 

706
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:36,904
and take you maybe 10 years,
cause what do you know near Bro Likely 

707
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:43,960
to make it worse than mechanical.
Just still tap and you'll say,

708
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:46,600
well you've charged me $500 for that.
And he'll say,

709
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:48,820
well,
it's a savings for you,

710
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:50,410
right?
You don't know where to tap.

711
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,240
So long trip,

712
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,193
okay,

713
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:58,600
what do you see when you don't know what
to seek?

714
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:02,750
That's what I think music is about.
Now I'll tell you why.

715
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:03,883
So what music does think of Bach?
Then what he does is he takes this 

716
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:12,770
temporal span and then he builds these 
complex patterns across it,

717
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:14,280
right?
And some of the patterns like,

718
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,153
and some of them go like this and some 
of them go like this and there's a 

719
00:39:18,741 --> 00:39:21,590
pattern here in a pattern here,
in a pattern here and pattern there.

720
00:39:21,591 --> 00:39:24,650
And some of them are going backwards.
I mean the guy's complicated,

721
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,650
you know?
Um,

722
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:27,943
it's stunning actually.
He actually wrote a song that you can 

723
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:31,820
play upside down and backwards and it's 
the same song,

724
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,550
man.
It's unbelievable.

725
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:39,410
Bach wrote so much music that it would 
take a talented copyist,

726
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:40,244
someone who just copies music 40 years 
of eight hour days just to transcribe 

727
00:39:43,221 --> 00:39:44,054
it.

728
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,423
Anyways,

729
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:49,020
Bach,
he presents you with this landscape.

730
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,033
It's an abstracted landscape of what the
landscape says is look at all the cool 

731
00:39:53,131 --> 00:39:56,160
patterns.
There's just layers and layers of them.

732
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:58,370
And then he,
he asks your perceptual system,

733
00:39:58,371 --> 00:39:59,970
it says here,
focus on this one.

734
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,130
There's this little interesting thing 
happening.

735
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,370
It's partly patterned and predictable,
but not too much.

736
00:40:05,371 --> 00:40:08,280
Cause then it's like a computer road.
It's patterned and predictable,

737
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:10,320
but it has this little edge of novelty 
on it.

738
00:40:10,321 --> 00:40:11,640
And that's,
that's interesting.

739
00:40:11,641 --> 00:40:14,850
That novelty keeps you dripped and you 
can pick out the patterns.

740
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,270
It's as if you're turning them into 
auditory objects on with Bach,

741
00:40:18,271 --> 00:40:20,190
you can do that at 10 levels at the same
time.

742
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:24,390
It's an an analog,
it's an analog of the real world and you

743
00:40:24,391 --> 00:40:25,224
get that as soon as you stopped thinking
of the real world as a simple place of 

744
00:40:27,571 --> 00:40:29,010
objects,
it's not,

745
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,053
it's a complex place of patterns and 
those patterns shift and change with 

746
00:40:34,021 --> 00:40:34,854
different in different situations and 
with different temporal frames of 

747
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:38,040
reference.

748
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,670
And that's what music is telling you and
that's why it's so deeply meaningful.

749
00:40:41,671 --> 00:40:42,504
Cause Music says to you here,
this is actually the structure of the 

750
00:40:44,431 --> 00:40:48,630
world beyond your simple perceptions.
This is the structure of the world.

751
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,750
Well that's kind of what I figured out 
when I was making this thing,

752
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:56,700
why I wanted it to kind of rotate a bit.
I don't know if it's successful.

753
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:02,220
It's actually a cube that said on edge.
So that's the edge of the cute there.

754
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:04,103
And so you can see into the cube.
It's a spiral at the same time and then 

755
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:08,124
it's a tunnel.
It's imagine a tunnel that's going back 

756
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,830
to a point and it's fragmented into 
these four things here.

757
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,233
And so it's like things are bursting out
of the middle of this tunnel and that 

758
00:41:18,571 --> 00:41:19,860
that's what music is like,
right?

759
00:41:19,861 --> 00:41:24,861
There's this just constant onslaught of 
new complex pattern forms.

760
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,210
I thought,
what does that mean?

761
00:41:27,211 --> 00:41:28,670
It means something.
Listen to music things.

762
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,720
This means something.
This means something.

763
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,620
I can feel it like I can experience it 
and I say,

764
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:34,640
well,
if you experience it,

765
00:41:34,641 --> 00:41:36,860
it's real.
How will you might think,

766
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,420
well,
the meaning of music isn't real.

767
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,070
Well,
it depends on what you mean,

768
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,630
right?
It depends on your presuppositions.

769
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:46,490
I think what means things is real.
There's this old idea,

770
00:41:46,491 --> 00:41:48,470
you know,
this is a funny little turn of phrase,

771
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:50,390
but I like it.
Materialists,

772
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:52,100
they think the world's made out of 
matter,

773
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,901
right?
Well,

774
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:56,270
this perspective isn't predicated on 
that idea.

775
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:57,403
This perspective is predicated on the 
idea that reality is made out of what 

776
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:04,280
matters and music expresses what 
matters.

777
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,470
Well,
and then you think,

778
00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:08,450
well,
is there any reason to think that way?

779
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,231
Well,
and I would say,

780
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:10,064
well,
soldier Nansen he said it's taking a 

781
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:16,160
page from Dostoyevsky said beauty will 
save the world.

782
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,593
So funny thing a,
because Solzhenitsyn is actually one of 

783
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:23,060
the people who helped save the world 
because his truth was at least in part,

784
00:42:23,061 --> 00:42:26,120
responsible for knocking out material in
the Soviet Union.

785
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,493
You know,
so maybe he's someone worth listening 

786
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:29,310
to.
Well,

787
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,730
what's meaning worth?
Well,

788
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,350
if you listen to music,
you know,

789
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,710
you can experience what music does to 
you.

790
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:39,740
It's direct,
it's in your own experiential field.

791
00:42:39,741 --> 00:42:40,574
The problem is you can't exactly 
quantify or qualify it by referring to 

792
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:45,890
other people cause it's a personal 
experience.

793
00:42:45,891 --> 00:42:46,724
But just because it's a personal 
experience doesn't mean it isn't real 

794
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:54,670
pains real or isn't it by Italia.
If you're in enough pain,

795
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,500
you're not going to be rationally 
arguing about that point.

796
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,300
You know,
we have an idea in our culture that it's

797
00:43:02,301 --> 00:43:06,260
what we know that saves us in a way.
You know,

798
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:11,740
that that keeps us able to cope with all
of the pressures of being alive.

799
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,510
And that's true.
You know,

800
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,060
what we do is very,
very useful,

801
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:21,020
but it's not useful enough because no 
matter how much you know,

802
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,190
there are certain problems that you 
still have and they're,

803
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:26,143
they're eternal problems.
There are the problems that you're 

804
00:43:28,971 --> 00:43:32,690
fragile and all sorts of ways,
mentally fragile,

805
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,740
physically fragile,
emotionally fragile,

806
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:35,923
you know,
you're not as good looking as you might 

807
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:38,050
be,
et Cetera,

808
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,700
et cetera.
And no matter how much you know,

809
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:41,803
none of that's really going to change.
And so you find cold comfort in 

810
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:48,320
knowledge and I'm not putting down 
knowledge.

811
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,110
Knowledge is a great thing,
but it's not enough.

812
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,540
And so then you think,
well,

813
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:54,374
what do you have except what you know?
And then I would say you have what you 

814
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,660
don't know.
And there's a lot of that,

815
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,093
right?
You're never going to run out of what 

816
00:44:02,091 --> 00:44:04,400
you don't know.
And then I would say,

817
00:44:04,401 --> 00:44:09,401
well then maybe what makes the 
difference between having a life that is

818
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:14,980
acceptable and and appropriate and one 
that's resentful and,

819
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:17,383
and full of hatred is what sort of real 
relationship you establish with what it 

820
00:44:23,421 --> 00:44:24,590
is that you don't know.

821
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,463
There's always more to learn.
And you see in in fairy tales and 

822
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:35,310
religious mythology,
people are always exhorted to be humble.

823
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:38,040
It's very annoying thing to be,
I would say.

824
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:41,370
But there's a funny,
there's a twist on that.

825
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:42,204
It's a,
it's a very interesting notion because 

826
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,233
the humble person isn't exactly meek.
The humble person is someone who knows 

827
00:44:49,471 --> 00:44:50,304
that the expanse of what they don't know
supersedes the expanse of what they do 

828
00:44:54,301 --> 00:44:55,134
know.
And so that it's in the encounter with 

829
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,640
what's not known,
that all the real information,

830
00:44:59,641 --> 00:45:02,370
that's where all the action takes place.
And you kind of know that a,

831
00:45:02,371 --> 00:45:04,890
because when you're really interested in
something and it grips you,

832
00:45:04,891 --> 00:45:05,724
you know,
you're right on the edge of where all 

833
00:45:06,421 --> 00:45:07,740
the information is coming,
right?

834
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:09,960
That's what makes it exciting.
You know something,

835
00:45:09,961 --> 00:45:11,550
but you're on the trail or something you
don't know,

836
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,384
and that really grips you and it should 
grip you because that's where you're 

837
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,170
getting all the new information.

838
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,200
And I think what music does as far as 
I'm concerned,

839
00:45:19,201 --> 00:45:21,810
is it speaks to us about what we don't 
know.

840
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:22,801
It says,
look,

841
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:23,634
there's outside of our presuppositions,
there's this domain that that is 

842
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:28,703
constantly patterned and informative and
meaningful and if you're open to it in 

843
00:45:33,991 --> 00:45:34,824
the appropriate way,
which is to pay attention to the 

844
00:45:36,271 --> 00:45:37,104
limitations of your knowledge and to 
watch what you're doing and more than a 

845
00:45:39,811 --> 00:45:43,560
merely intellectual sense that this 
unknown pattern,

846
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:47,400
expats is richly informative events 
sustain it.

847
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:51,120
And I think that every time you listen 
to a piece of music and it grabs you,

848
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,193
that's what it's telling you.
And I also think you know that now you 

849
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:56,124
don't know what to say it,
but there's lots of things you don't 

850
00:45:58,081 --> 00:45:58,914
know to say.
You don't know how to keep your heart 

851
00:46:00,661 --> 00:46:02,370
beating.
You don't know how to walk.

852
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,400
I mean the list of things you don't know
is a very long list.

853
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:08,790
And the mere fact that you don't know it
doesn't mean that it isn't true.

854
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,420
Well then you ask yourself with regards 
to your relationship with something like

855
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:17,750
music is what it says real or not.
And I would say like pain.

856
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:22,500
What music tells you is so real that it 
makes other things that are real seem to

857
00:46:22,501 --> 00:46:23,334
pale in comparison.
Well you know I like music a lot so 

858
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:30,060
maybe that's an experience that it's 
idiosyncratic to me.

859
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,073
But then you have to explain I suppose 
why music has had such a powerful grip 

860
00:46:34,471 --> 00:46:35,304
on our culture or it's funny cause I 
read a book on evolutionary psychology 

861
00:46:40,651 --> 00:46:44,190
while ago written by Steven Pinker,
a big thick book.

862
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:48,870
It was like one little thin chapter at 
the end devoted to aesthetics,

863
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:52,950
music and religion.
And I thought that's pretty interesting.

864
00:46:52,951 --> 00:46:57,000
You know,
because for some people like aesthetics,

865
00:46:57,001 --> 00:46:57,834
religion,
well let's say philosophy is like this 

866
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:04,050
much of the book with the rest of it 
being this much and

867
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,873
our mind,
I'm not really interested in debating 

868
00:47:08,051 --> 00:47:08,884
that.
What I am interested more in saying is 

869
00:47:11,441 --> 00:47:12,274
that
there is a way to understand what it is 

870
00:47:16,891 --> 00:47:17,724
that our aesthetic experiences tell us.
But what they tell us isn't in the 

871
00:47:22,141 --> 00:47:22,974
language that we normally speak and the 
language that aesthetics toxin has 

872
00:47:28,051 --> 00:47:31,420
something genuine to offer us.
It's not HEPA.

873
00:47:31,421 --> 00:47:33,580
Phenomenal.
It's not derivative.

874
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:37,090
It's not secondary.
It's fundamental and primary.

875
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,910
It's about what things mean and how to 
act.

876
00:47:39,911 --> 00:47:40,744
And for us that's a big deal because we 
need to know how to act and the arts 

877
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:47,890
tell us that.
And music tells us that in the most sort

878
00:47:47,891 --> 00:47:49,120
of comprehensive and

879
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:54,450
the most comprehensive and abstract way,
it's,

880
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:55,650
it's still grips.
You though.

881
00:47:55,651 --> 00:47:57,510
It grips your body,
even it makes you move.

882
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,680
It's abstract,
but it's,

883
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:01,720
it's concrete at the same time.
And you can't argue it away.

884
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,070
If you experience it,
you can see exactly what it means.

885
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,500
And I think that when you listen to 
music,

886
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:12,600
what you experience is what you should 
experience in relationship to reality.

887
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,793
And I think it's that observation that 
does for you what it is that music does 

888
00:48:18,001 --> 00:48:19,950
for you.
And all great art does that.

889
00:48:19,951 --> 00:48:23,460
And all great literature.
And I would say there's no reason not to

890
00:48:23,461 --> 00:48:24,330
assume it's real.

891
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,033
That's it.

892
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,320
Oh yes.
Music could be the fruit of love.

893
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:37,573
Play on according to Peterson,
existence is made up of infinite 

894
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:47,180
hierarchical landscapes of patterns.
And it is only through focusing the lens

895
00:48:47,181 --> 00:48:48,014
of your perception that you actually 
make any sense of existence at all the 

896
00:48:51,411 --> 00:48:52,244
way,
but you look at the world is guided by 

897
00:48:53,811 --> 00:48:56,170
your wants and the way that the world 
looks at you.

898
00:48:56,171 --> 00:48:57,890
It depends on what you.
