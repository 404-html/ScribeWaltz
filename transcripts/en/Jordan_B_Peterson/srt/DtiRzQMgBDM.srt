1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,753
Okay,

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:06,883
so people are possessed by a question.
It's part of our nature to be possessed 

3
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:15,504
by this question and so you can think 
about this as an architectural question 

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,673
if you like,
and the question is what are we doing 

5
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:25,284
here?
And you can ask yourself that in 

6
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:32,781
relationship to this conference.
You're here to search for meaning and to

7
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:36,600
understand what that might mean,
but you also might ask yourself,

8
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:37,434
well,
why is it that you have to be here for 

9
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,374
your search for meaning?
Why is that something that drives human 

10
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:46,250
beings?
It doesn't characteristic.

11
00:00:46,251 --> 00:00:47,450
For example,
of animals,

12
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,580
they don't seem to question their 
existence,

13
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,790
so there's something about the very 
nature of human being that makes us feel

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,840
as if something needs to be set right.
When that's been discussed historically,

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,040
it's been associated with the term 
redemption.

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,370
People are in need of redemption in the 
modern age.

17
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:15,400
We talk about positive psychology and we
talk about happiness,

18
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:16,234
which is a much weaker word,
but our forefathers had a more profound 

19
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:23,214
sense of the problematic state of human 
existence and they use more profound 

20
00:01:28,761 --> 00:01:33,380
words and the idea that we have a need 
for redemption is a more profound idea.

21
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,330
Human beings,
and I'm going to talk mostly about human

22
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:42,930
beings in the West because that's the 
literature that I'm most familiar with.

23
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,030
Human beings in the West have been 
meditating on the nature of human beings

24
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,060
for thousands of years perhaps ever 
since we became self conscious,

25
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,533
which is another thing that 
distinguishes us from animals and 

26
00:01:58,031 --> 00:02:00,190
another thing that drives our search for
meaning.

27
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,693
The consequence of this meditation or 
one of the consequences of this 

28
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:07,414
meditation has been the production of a 
series of books that people know is the 

29
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:15,931
Bible.
I realized years ago that people saw the

30
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:18,644
world through lenses of belief and more 
recently it's been demonstrated that 

31
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,550
that's actually inevitable because 
you're a limited cognitive processor.

32
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,240
You have to frame your perceptions with 
beliefs.

33
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,113
What I learned is that the belief 
systems that people use to frame their 

34
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:42,750
perceptions have a structure and that 
structure is religious,

35
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,200
so religious presupposition is one that 
you you might even know not noticed that

36
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:50,034
you make.
It's it's a predicate or an axiom or an 

37
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:52,524
assumption,
and the study of those axiomatic 

38
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:59,931
assumptions is what religion is about 
and one of your axiomatic assumptions,

39
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:03,474
for example,
is that life involves a search for 

40
00:03:06,981 --> 00:03:11,720
meaning and that's associated with the 
idea of redemption and you.

41
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,900
You'll notice that you asked that 
question because of course you're here,

42
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,693
but you might not notice how strange it 
is that all of you asked that question 

43
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,293
and the fact that all of you asked that 
question that human beings have asked 

44
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:26,570
that question for as far back as we can 
understand,

45
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,360
is indicative of something profound 
about human nature.

46
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,520
It's lack of completion.

47
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,443
I'm going to walk you through the series
of stories that make up this library of 

48
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,480
books known as the Bible because it 
presents a theory of redemption.

49
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,243
That in a sense is emergent.
It's a consequence of this insanely 

50
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:53,234
complicated,
cross-generational meditation on the 

51
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:02,581
nature of being.
It's not designed by any one person.

52
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:05,973
It's designed by processes that we don't
really understand because we don't know 

53
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,443
anything about how books are written 
over thousands of years or what forces 

54
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:14,344
caused them to be compiled into a 
certain way or what narrative direction 

55
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:18,760
they tend to take.
Now,

56
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:20,590
one of the things that's strange about 
the Bible,

57
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:21,424
given that it's a collection of books,
is that it actually has a narrative 

58
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:24,094
structure.
It has a story and that story's been 

59
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:28,530
cobbled together.
It's,

60
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,760
it's like it's emerged out of the 
depths.

61
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,750
It's not a top down story.
It's a bottom up story.

62
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Then I suppose that's why many of the 
world's major religions regard the Bible

63
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:42,310
as a book that was revealed rather than 
one that was written.

64
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,043
It's a perfectly reasonable 
presupposition that it's revealed 

65
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:49,600
because it's not the consequence of the 
work of anyone author.

66
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,200
It's not written according to a plan or 
not a plan that we can understand,

67
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,793
but nonetheless it has a structure.
It also has a strange structure in that 

68
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,140
it's full of stories that no one can 
forgive,

69
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:02,974
but that also that no one can understand
and the combination of incomprehensible 

70
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:08,134
and unforgettable is a very strange 
combination and of course that 

71
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,460
combination is basically mythological,

72
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,753
so I'm going to start out by telling you
what genesis has to say about why it is 

73
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:22,430
that you need to search for meaning.

74
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,753
Nope.
People are pretty familiar as a general 

75
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:28,154
rule with the basic stories in genesis.
Genesis starts out with the word of God 

76
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:37,991
creating being from chaos.
That's a very complicated idea.

77
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,160
The idea is that whatever the word is,
which is logos from a,

78
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,250
from a Christian perspective,
from a Western perspective,

79
00:05:46,251 --> 00:05:47,084
that logos,
which is something like consciousness 

80
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:49,304
and something like speech,
has the power to pull order out of an 

81
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:55,250
underlying chaos.
Now we do this all the time.

82
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,690
People do this all the time.
That's I suppose in some sense,

83
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,420
white were hypothetically made in the 
image of God.

84
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,063
We use our consciousness to constantly 
construct being out of chaos and 

85
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,700
according to the initial opening of 
genesis.

86
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,700
There's something about that that's akin
to the construction of the world,

87
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,410
and so that means that from the 
perspective of this book,

88
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,040
consciousness itself plays a world 
constructing role.

89
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,730
It's got a central place and human 
beings in some sense,

90
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,510
parties participate in that in some 
minor sense I suppose,

91
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,333
but in a sense that not nonetheless 
makes them akin to what the library 

92
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:38,690
books called the Bible assumes his daddy
and one squad

93
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,573
logos extracts order out of chaos.
He builds a little world and it 

94
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:48,184
populates it,
and then in the little world he puts a 

95
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:51,850
garden,
a walled garden,

96
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,053
Paradise.
It's paradise means walled garden or 

97
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,383
Eden.
Eden means well watered place and you 

98
00:06:57,731 --> 00:06:58,564
might think,
well,

99
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,643
why had garden?
And the answer to that is a garden is 

100
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:02,584
the optimal combination of nature and 
culture or chaos and order because the 

101
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:11,170
garden is where nature flourishes,
but it's also where nature flourishes in

102
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:14,570
a,
in a safe and controlled environment.

103
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:15,404
And so that's like an optimal 
environment for people and so there's a 

104
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:18,844
garden.
God puts the people in there and that's 

105
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:23,950
optimal.
When he warns them,

106
00:07:23,951 --> 00:07:25,600
he says,
this is a strange thing.

107
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:26,171
He says,
well,

108
00:07:26,171 --> 00:07:30,540
now you're in the garden.
That's where you should live and there's

109
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,550
something you shouldn't do and what you 
shouldn't do is eat a particular fruit.

110
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,660
Now I'm going to tell you something 
about vision.

111
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,500
Human beings have excellent vision.
First of all,

112
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:50,050
we see color,
hardly any creature see color,

113
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:55,051
but we do and not only do we see color,
but our vision is tremendously acute.

114
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,790
The only other animals that can see as 
well as us or birds of prey for mammals,

115
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,050
man,
we can see like you wouldn't believe and

116
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,133
and for primates as well as we can see 
much better than our closest primate 

117
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,220
relatives and why that is is a bit of 
mystery,

118
00:08:12,221 --> 00:08:13,054
but there's a woman in California who 
seems perhaps to absolve that her name 

119
00:08:16,631 --> 00:08:17,464
is Lynne Isbell and she was very 
interested in how human beings develop 

120
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:21,154
vision and she's interested in patterns 
of Predation Predator prey 

121
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:27,064
relationships,
and she knew that our treed dwelling 

122
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:35,680
ancestors millions of years ago,
were frequently preyed upon by snakes.

123
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,683
In fact,
there's some evidence that are tree 

124
00:08:38,831 --> 00:08:42,220
dwelling ancestors and snakes,
coal evolved,

125
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,653
and that our visual system is 
particularly good at picking up the 

126
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:50,920
patterns of camouflage that snakes used 
to hide in trees or in the undergrowth,

127
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,090
and what Isabelle showed was that if you
looked at primate populations around the

128
00:08:57,091 --> 00:09:02,020
world where there were more predatory 
snakes,

129
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,890
the primates could see better.
It's a very high correlation,

130
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:07,803
and so she concluded that the reason 
that human beings can see so well is 

131
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:11,860
because of snakes.

132
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:14,843
Now she thought the association between 
that and the snake story in genesis was 

133
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:24,270
interestingly coincidental,
but it's much more than that.

134
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,940
No,
we don't know how the Adam and Eve story

135
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,590
came about.
We know it's very ancient,

136
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,940
but there's something about it that 
sticks in our memory and in our culture,

137
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:35,690
and the reason for that seems to be that
in some strange way,

138
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:38,520
it's an extraordinarily accurate 
summation.

139
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,500
Snakes gave us vision.
What about fruit?

140
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,283
Lot of the reason we can see colors is 
because our visual system evolved to 

141
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:53,500
detect ripe fruit.
What about women?

142
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,180
Well,
you have to be pretty waked out a woman,

143
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,850
so there's this weird interconnection in
genesis between women,

144
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,853
fruit and snakes,
and the idea is that the interplay 

145
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:11,174
between the three you remember women are
gatherers to or were gatherers 

146
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,970
historically speaking and they shared 
food with men and that's a strange thing

147
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,910
because human beings share food and 
hardly any other animals do and so women

148
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:23,744
didn't tempt men with fruit and they 
didn't make them self conscious along 

149
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:31,880
with the snake and the fruit,
and that was a catastrophe.

150
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,650
What happens in genesis is that when 
people become self conscious,

151
00:10:36,651 --> 00:10:39,590
when they eat the fruit,
their vision improves.

152
00:10:39,591 --> 00:10:40,424
The scales fall from their eyes and all 
of a sudden they can see in a way that 

153
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,274
no other animal has ever seen and one of
the things they can see is that they're 

154
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,050
naked and that's a big problem.

155
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,731
And you might ask,
well,

156
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:54,070
what does being naked?
Meaning?

157
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,760
That's quite straightforward.
People often dream,

158
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:57,594
for example,
of being naked in front of a crowd and 

159
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,823
to be naked in front of a crowd is to 
have all your frailties and 

160
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:07,631
vulnerabilities revealed to judgment.
And that's a nightmare for people and so

161
00:11:09,531 --> 00:11:14,531
to become self aware is to wake up into 
a nightmare and the nightmare involves a

162
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,073
profound realization,
no individual vulnerability and the 

163
00:11:22,971 --> 00:11:23,804
consequence of that in genesis is that 
people are banished from paradise and 

164
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:29,923
are from then on in need of redemption 
and that they have to work and that's 

165
00:11:35,181 --> 00:11:39,890
how man comes to be in a fallen state 
and you don't have a need for redemption

166
00:11:39,891 --> 00:11:40,724
or need for meaning or request after 
meaning unless you're in a fallen state 

167
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,483
and everyone is strangely enough,
has this intuition that they're in a 

168
00:11:48,921 --> 00:11:49,754
fallen state,
that something is wrong with the world 

169
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:54,610
that needs to be put right and and more 
that or something is wrong with being.

170
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:56,890
It needs to be put right.
And more than that,

171
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,590
that in some weird sense,
weird way.

172
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:00,424
They have a moral obligation to 
participate in that process and that 

173
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:07,390
drives us like it's beneath what drives 
us.

174
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,583
It's an axiomatic presupposition.
The next thing that happens in genesis 

175
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:14,014
is that Abel and Cain are born and 
they're really the first two human 

176
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:20,770
beings because

177
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,480
Adam and eve are made by God.
Whereas Cain and Abel are born there,

178
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,490
they're the first people that are born 
in history

179
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,833
and

180
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,990
interestingly enough,
what happens between Cain and Abel,

181
00:12:32,991 --> 00:12:36,740
which is jealous,
resentment against God,

182
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,603
followed by murder,
is the first pattern of behavior that 

183
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,400
human beings manifest.
Once they become self conscious.

184
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,743
That's an awful story and it's a 
prototypical story in a sense because 

185
00:12:48,111 --> 00:12:48,944
what it says is that there are two 
patterns of reaction to tragic 

186
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,370
selfconsciousness and one is associated 
with a murderer,

187
00:12:55,371 --> 00:12:58,490
a state of resentment,
resentment towards life.

188
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,630
The kind of murderous resentment that 
drove the killer in Colorado,

189
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,523
for example,
murderous resentment against life and 

190
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:07,334
the other typified by Abel has something
to do with the establishment of the 

191
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:15,254
antithesis of murderous resentment.
So you can associate murderous 

192
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:19,004
resentment in a sense with hell and you 
can associate ables path his choices 

193
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:24,164
with heaven.
And so what happens is that as soon as 

194
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:26,354
people become self conscious,
being divides into a domain that has 

195
00:13:29,991 --> 00:13:33,890
held on one on one end and heaven on 
another,

196
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:38,060
and that's when we hinted that in the 
second story in genesis.

197
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,150
After that,
everything dissolves into a flood.

198
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,030
That's Noah.
Into a flood,

199
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,290
nature comes in,
tears,

200
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,124
everything down and the Tower of Babel 
is erected and that's a meditation on 

201
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:52,504
pride.
People build a structure that's reaches 

202
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:55,264
up to where God is.
It's a presumptuous act and there's 

203
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,233
there's a reason for that too.
One of the consistent warnings that 

204
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:02,884
emerges in the biblical writings,
his warnings against the sin of pride 

205
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:06,814
and the sin of pride is an intellectual 
sin and it's associated with the 

206
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:10,504
presupposition that you know enough to 
do without the transcendent and the 

207
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:18,904
biblical story state very,
very clearly continually that that is 

208
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,980
catastrophic,
dangerous,

209
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,083
that you always have to be aware that 
there's something transcendent that 

210
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:30,460
supersedes the domain of your knowledge

211
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,480
and and

212
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,100
and what,
what might you think of people who,

213
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,940
who don't believe that well are 
totalitarians because they believed that

214
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:44,590
their belief is total and we know what 
happens when people become totalitarian.

215
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:49,240
What happens is you get the instant 
creation of something on earth that very

216
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:53,840
closely resembles hell and that was 
hammered home in the 20th century.

217
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,010
If you want to derive one lesson from 
the 20th century,

218
00:14:58,011 --> 00:14:58,844
it's the totalitarian states and 
totalitarian ideologies are not a good 

219
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:08,891
way to entrap or or search after 
meaning.

220
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:11,810
That's a mistake

221
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,560
after the flood.
The flood is before the flood.

222
00:15:19,561 --> 00:15:21,390
That's prehistory.
That's so far back in time.

223
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:23,220
We can't even imagine it after the 
flood.

224
00:15:23,221 --> 00:15:25,170
There's A.
There's a new beginning in a sense,

225
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:26,004
and that's when history really starts 
from a biblical perspective and the way 

226
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,753
the Old Testament lays itself out then 
is that it's kind of a classic hero 

227
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:36,240
myth,
a hero myth.

228
00:15:36,241 --> 00:15:39,720
It's associated with the establishment 
of states and generally speaking,

229
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:43,230
when when societies mythologize the 
beginning of their state,

230
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:44,963
they imagine a set of heroes.
It's sort of happening with people like 

231
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:52,050
George Washington in the United States.
It happens automatically if the founders

232
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,550
of the state,
our state,

233
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:56,310
our mythologized as of the great heroes 
of the past.

234
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,443
It's the great heroes of the past.
Our forefathers who established the 

235
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:03,510
state,
and of course that's true and there were

236
00:16:03,511 --> 00:16:04,344
millions of them,
but you can't tell a story about 

237
00:16:05,871 --> 00:16:06,704
millions of people.
So all the actions of those millions of 

238
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:09,984
people are collapsed and condensed and 
compressed and turned it into a kind of 

239
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:13,704
fiction that's more real than truth,
that describes the patterns that 

240
00:16:17,881 --> 00:16:18,714
characterize how the state was founded 
and the Old Testament runs us through 

241
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:27,610
that.
The heroes like Abraham for example,

242
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,403
and Jacob who are crucially involved in 
the establishment of the policy of the 

243
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:35,890
actual state,

244
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:43,690
but something always happens as this 
state is established and what happens is

245
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,973
the states established and then people 
get off course and the leadership gets 

246
00:16:52,931 --> 00:16:56,770
off course and then the state collapses 
into a state of chaos,

247
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,140
and then there's a prophetic revelation 
warning of that danger,

248
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,970
and then there's a terrible period of 
chaotic disruption,

249
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,030
and then there's the regeneration of the
state.

250
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,720
That story is foreshadowed in the Old 
Testament by Exodus Moses story.

251
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,383
Egypt's a tyranny.
A leader rises to pull everyone out of 

252
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:26,210
tyranny.
There is a terrible chaotic interlude.

253
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,343
The wandering in the desert,
and then there's the reestablishment of 

254
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:31,394
the state.

255
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,480
That's an archetypal pattern that 
happens to all of you.

256
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,500
It happens to every country in the 
pattern is here in your system of belief

257
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,604
which is yours in the collective belief 
and something arises like a snake and 

258
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,573
now it gets to a snake to disrupt it 
because the state is insufficiently 

259
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:59,580
adapted to the environment.
It doesn't have all the answers.

260
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,870
It ages and becomes corrupt,
and then it's prone to collapse and that

261
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,670
collapses a catastrophe.
Okay.

262
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,220
Audit catastrophe that happens to you 
every time,

263
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,413
for example,
that your dreams are shattered or that 

264
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:15,354
you encounter a great tragedy.
It happens to people when their spouse 

265
00:18:17,911 --> 00:18:20,160
dies or when they're diagnosed with a 
very,

266
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,300
very dangerous illness or when their 
children are damaged.

267
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,430
That event analogous,
as I said to a snake,

268
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:30,264
and that's partly because the circuits 
in your brain that detects snakes that 

269
00:18:33,271 --> 00:18:34,104
other animals use to detect snakes are 
the same circuits that we use to detect 

270
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:37,704
things that go wrong and things are 
always going wrong for us and we're 

271
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:45,900
always collapsing into a state where 
we're wandering through a desert and the

272
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:46,734
desert is a state that's bereft of 
meaning and bereft of ideas and in that 

273
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:50,934
state then we're desperately seeking for
while for the establishment of another 

274
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:57,000
state and a state that we hope will be a
better state.

275
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,163
It'll be like the last date,
except there'll be more to it and 

276
00:18:59,731 --> 00:19:03,450
everyone will finally be happy and that 
that's part of our Utopian dream

277
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,970
and it's impossible not to be in that 
story.

278
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,340
You're either in a state of order or 
you're in a state of chaos.

279
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,100
That's where the Dallas,
for example,

280
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:19,130
believed that the world is made out of 
order and chaos is because you're always

281
00:19:19,131 --> 00:19:19,964
in one of those two places.
What happens in the old testament is 

282
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:28,481
that the limitations of the state itself
start to become apparent and they become

283
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:33,530
apparent in that the state has 
established,

284
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:35,600
but it always collapses and then it's 
reestablished,

285
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:38,630
but it always collapses.
It's never permanent,

286
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,873
and and there's repetitions of this 
continual repetitions of this and not 

287
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,183
out of the Old Testament.
At least the way that it's been 

288
00:19:46,641 --> 00:19:51,641
constructed in Christianity is that the 
state itself is flawed.

289
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:59,300
It cannot provide.
The final answer to the question,

290
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,820
what constitutes genuine redemption?

291
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,920
Well,
this is an important issue.

292
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:06,840
It's an important issue.
Psychologically.

293
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,860
It's an important issue.
Politically is the state.

294
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:13,230
The final answer,
well,

295
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,603
it's a totalitarian claim.
We know that it was claimed by people 

296
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:17,424
like Stella.
It was certainly claimed by the 

297
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:18,954
communists.
It was claimed by people like Hitler 

298
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:21,114
that the state was.
The final answer is still claimed in 

299
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:25,440
many ways in places like China.
Today,

300
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,910
the is subsumed underneath the state 
organization in this state,

301
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,230
well,
under Schell in the state was already in

302
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:35,064
a state of perfection.
If you complained about its 

303
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:38,190
imperfection,
then you were going to be killed.

304
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,063
So the idea that the state is perfect,
although it's a tremendously flawed 

305
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:47,010
idea,
can be pursued so hard,

306
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:52,120
people who are gripping their narrow 
viewpoints that the state itself becomes

307
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:52,954
murderous.
The Old Testament sorta sums itself up 

308
00:20:56,141 --> 00:20:56,974
in the book of job and it's a 
problematic summing up because joe is 

309
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:01,294
tormented in all sorts of ways.
Everything that could possibly be 

310
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:05,164
terrible that happens to any person 
happens to job and he can't understand 

311
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:14,011
why so job is in like a final state of 
unredeemed being the states,

312
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:18,424
not the answer

313
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,640
well,
so then if being is order being is chaos

314
00:21:24,641 --> 00:21:29,200
and chaos is intolerable and the state 
order is not the answer,

315
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:30,783
what do you have left?
That's the question the new testament 

316
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,590
attempts to solve.
One of the problems with with the Soviet

317
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,423
Union,
for example,

318
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,260
was their inability to correct errors.
See,

319
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,094
when you start out with an a priori 
hypothesis about what constitutes the 

320
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:47,944
truth and that structures your life,
it's very difficult to make the kind of 

321
00:21:53,381 --> 00:21:54,214
micro corrections that estate has to 
make on a continual basis in order to 

322
00:21:57,551 --> 00:22:02,551
remain dynamic and fluid.
So in order to stay adaptive to reality,

323
00:22:02,861 --> 00:22:04,360
not only do you have to have a 
viewpoint,

324
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:05,194
but you have to engage in a process of 
modifying that viewpoint and the way 

325
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:11,320
that you engage in the process of 
modifying that viewpoint.

326
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:12,154
There's two ways really.
One is continual minor adjustments as a 

327
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:16,540
consequence of paying attention.

328
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,153
So for example,
if you're having a conversation with 

329
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:22,030
your wife or a friend,
or maybe it's a difficult conversation,

330
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,910
there's a couple of ways that 
conversation can go.

331
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,300
One is you can take your viewpoint and 
you can impose it on that person,

332
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,970
and often when people are talking,
that's what they're trying to do.

333
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,043
They're not having a conversation.
What they're doing is attempting to 

334
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:35,464
impose a viewpoint that they already 
hold the ear on the person that's 

335
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:39,490
listening and if they're a tyrant or a 
bully,

336
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:40,324
they'll do that and pay no attention 
whatsoever to the person's response and 

337
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:43,774
in fact,
they'll get irritated and even violent 

338
00:22:44,891 --> 00:22:46,830
if the person doesn't accept.
There are a priority.

339
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:47,664
Framing

340
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,850
is there an alternative?
Mother is an alternative.

341
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:54,523
The alternative is to pay attention and 
to listen on the off chance that the 

342
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:02,840
person that you're talking to might tell
you something you don't know,

343
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,513
but in order to listen,
you have to be already convinced that 

344
00:23:06,711 --> 00:23:07,544
the little theory that you're using to 
orient yourself in the world isn't good 

345
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:13,640
enough because if it was good enough,
then why would you bother listening?

346
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,073
So you have to be deeply aware of your 
own ignorance and that's what humility 

347
00:23:17,211 --> 00:23:18,044
means.
Humility means to be deeply aware of 

348
00:23:19,311 --> 00:23:20,144
your own ignorance.
It doesn't mean to slink around in and 

349
00:23:22,091 --> 00:23:25,850
ashamed manner.
It means to make the presupposition that

350
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:26,684
you may still have something left to 
learn and that this annoying person in 

351
00:23:28,971 --> 00:23:29,804
front of you might have something to 
teach you if you would just listen and 

352
00:23:33,951 --> 00:23:37,580
so you're discussing a problem and a 
problem.

353
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,430
Is this a time when the things you think
aren't working?

354
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:41,743
That's what constitutes a problem.
So we have a little problem and you're 

355
00:23:44,211 --> 00:23:45,044
discussing it.
Let's with your wife and she offers you 

356
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:49,124
her opinion and you can brush it off and
in which case your little state stays 

357
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:55,040
intact.
It doesn't move,

358
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:55,874
it's still made out of stone.
It's pillars and you're still a tyrant 

359
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,770
or you can listen.
You can think,

360
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:01,820
oh,
I see there,

361
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,653
there's a micro correction that I need 
to make in one of the peripheral 

362
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:06,824
elements of my belief,
and that's a little painful because it 

363
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,230
means you have to let something go,
your your,

364
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,240
your presumption,
and then you have to be a little chaotic

365
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:18,200
as you adjust to the new information and
then you have to reconstitute yourself,

366
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,590
and what that means interestingly 
enough,

367
00:24:21,591 --> 00:24:23,180
is that you have to make a sacrifice.

368
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,800
God likes sacrifices,
especially if they're of the proper kind

369
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,993
and the proper kind of sacrifices,
the one that you made of your micro 

370
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:32,084
belief.
When you're faced with evidence of 

371
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:33,764
error,
and if you make those sorts of micro 

372
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:36,254
sacrifices,
then God stays pleased with you and the 

373
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:42,290
reason for that is that your models of 
the world stay up to date.

374
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,323
Now,
one of the things that happened in the 

375
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:45,734
old testament all the time is that 
people are making sacrifices to God and 

376
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:50,440
modern people.
They just have no idea what I like.

377
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:55,450
Why does God want burnt lamb smoke?
It's not obvious to modern people,

378
00:24:57,681 --> 00:24:59,840
but you know you,
your ancestors were stupid.

379
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,973
They were dramatizing something.
They were dramatizing this tremendous 

380
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:07,640
realization,
but no other creature has ever managed,

381
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:08,474
which is that there are things you can 
do to your being that change the nature 

382
00:25:13,611 --> 00:25:17,660
of reality and if you do them properly,
you can make reality better.

383
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,003
It's mind boggling and they acted that 
out because they didn't really 

384
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:22,214
understand it.
They noticed that if things weren't 

385
00:25:25,521 --> 00:25:26,354
going right,
you had to sacrifice something valuable 

386
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,700
and that seemed to make God happy.
Well,

387
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,720
it might've been a firstborn calf or 
firstborn son for that matter,

388
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,360
for modern people.
It's more like an idea.

389
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,153
You have to sacrifice an idea that you 
hold dear in order to progress because 

390
00:25:44,181 --> 00:25:47,060
the ideas that you hold dear are exactly
what are making you suffer.

391
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,200
If you're suffering

392
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,700
so you have to sacrifice them and then 
you have to let them go,

393
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:53,534
and the consequences of that is that you
enter into this little period of chaos 

394
00:25:56,031 --> 00:25:58,040
and then maybe you pop out of that and 
that's a good thing,

395
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,570
and so here's an interesting 
observation.

396
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:09,070
That process of being in the state and 
identifying an error and correcting it,

397
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:13,100
that's a little death and rebirth.
That's like the Phoenix.

398
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,430
The Phoenix dissolved itself into ashes 
and then pops back up as a.

399
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,680
As a new bird

400
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,060
in the new testament,
there's this weird idea for that.

401
00:26:24,061 --> 00:26:24,894
You have to identify with a person who 
continually dies in his reward or what 

402
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:31,674
does that mean?
It means that the idea that redemption 

403
00:26:36,751 --> 00:26:39,720
itself is not the consequences of being 
in a state.

404
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,633
It's the consequence of participating in
a process and the process is the 

405
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:49,860
willingness to continually have yourself
sacrificed,

406
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:55,110
chaotic and then reward,
and that's what keeps things alive.

407
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,600
Now,
in the,

408
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,663
in the passion story,
there are other elements and the 

409
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:04,200
elements are important.
So for example,

410
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:10,790
the story of Christ is predicated on the
assumption that the person who is making

411
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,670
the ultimate sacrifices performance 
another,

412
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:14,603
a number of acts or undergoes a number 
of processes and one is a disciplined 

413
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:20,880
apprenticeship.
So for example,

414
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,980
in order to have some ideas that you can
let go and then reconstitute,

415
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,930
you have to have some ideas.

416
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:33,410
You can't just be all chaotic and 
uninformed and so in the New Testament,

417
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,840
Christ is a master of tradition.
He's a master of the law and you have to

418
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:40,524
be disciplined.
You have to be a master of something 

419
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:46,320
before you're formed at all.
You have to be imbued with the spirit of

420
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:49,100
your ancestors will say.
You have to take on that.

421
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:50,603
That burden.
You see this reflected in popular 

422
00:27:52,561 --> 00:27:53,700
culture.
For example,

423
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:54,534
in the Movie Pinocchio,
at the end of the movie when Pinocchio 

424
00:27:57,871 --> 00:27:58,704
is about to become a real boy,
his last challenge is to rescue his 

425
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:06,060
father and he does that and to rescue 
the father means to make peace with your

426
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:06,894
culture and to embody it.
But then not to assume that that's 

427
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:13,260
absolute.
It's a necessary process of discipline.

428
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,413
The next idea that underlies the passion
ideas in the new testament is that the 

429
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:28,161
ultimate sacrifice is the sacrifice of 
yourself to God.

430
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,223
Now,
that's a very strange idea and it's a 

431
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,294
very,
very sophisticated idea because what 

432
00:28:34,351 --> 00:28:35,184
happens in the old testament is there's 
the constant sacrificing of something 

433
00:28:38,611 --> 00:28:39,444
else.
This requires a different order of 

434
00:28:43,951 --> 00:28:44,784
being.
What does it mean to offer yourself up 

435
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:49,980
as a sacrifice to God?
Well

436
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,733
can think of God as an inevitable 
representation of the highest possible 

437
00:28:57,941 --> 00:29:00,730
value.
That's what monotheistic pursue memory,

438
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,180
presumed God's nameable.
Even the Israelites presumed that garden

439
00:29:04,181 --> 00:29:06,670
wasn't nameable.
It's inevitable,

440
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:09,280
but it's the ultimate value.
Whatever the ultimate value is,

441
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:13,150
you don't know what it is,
but you've got to have some idea and the

442
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:13,984
idea of offering yourself up as a 
sacrifice to God is the same thing as 

443
00:29:16,451 --> 00:29:17,284
determining that your life will be 
guided by unshakable commitment to the 

444
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:21,874
highest good,
and what that means is that it's no 

445
00:29:23,951 --> 00:29:24,784
longer your state that's in charger.
It's no longer your ego that's in 

446
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:31,330
charge.
It's not even you that's in charge.

447
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,313
It means that your conversations with 
people who are no longer going to be 

448
00:29:34,241 --> 00:29:37,280
about convincing them that your 
viewpoint is a right.

449
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,823
It means that what your conversation is 
going to be about in your speech about 

450
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:46,381
attempting to represent what you believe
to be true in the most concise and clear

451
00:29:47,441 --> 00:29:50,680
possible manner no matter what,

452
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,210
and that's not how people live.
People live in a sense by.

453
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:02,420
It's like a conniving and the conniving 
is a totalitarian,

454
00:30:02,461 --> 00:30:03,294
conniving.
The conniving is an idea that the world 

455
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,180
shouldn't be the way that I wanted to 
be.

456
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,163
I have a theory about how I want it to 
be and I'm going to enforce that theory 

457
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,913
and I'm going to be very angry when the 
world doesn't respond the way I wanted 

458
00:30:15,931 --> 00:30:16,764
to and maybe even be violent as a 
consequence of it and I have some sense 

459
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:23,400
of where I'm headed.
I'm headed for wealth for example,

460
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:24,503
and I'm headed to an advertisement.
So I'm with my wife when I'm 50 on a 

461
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:30,330
tropical beach and that's how I'm going 
to be redeemed.

462
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,810
And it's a narrow and totalitarian 
viewpoint.

463
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,663
And then I sacrificed everything to that
and it turns out that that's a very bad 

464
00:30:36,661 --> 00:30:37,494
idea because things don't turn out the 
way I want them to turn out and the 

465
00:30:41,551 --> 00:30:42,384
alternative to that,
and this is part of what happens in the 

466
00:30:44,671 --> 00:30:45,960
sermon on the mount,
which is very,

467
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:46,794
very strange document because it 
represents a transformation from the 

468
00:30:50,491 --> 00:30:51,324
idea that morality is constituted by 
adherence to a set of rules to morality 

469
00:30:55,411 --> 00:30:59,250
being aimed at something that you might 
think about as more of a positive good.

470
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:02,130
It's not merely not doing what's wrong,
it's something else.

471
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,083
It's sacrificing yourself in the attempt
to make things better and making things 

472
00:31:07,981 --> 00:31:10,080
better.
Not by aiming at what's better,

473
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:14,880
but by telling what's true and assuming 
that if you do that,

474
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,780
then what's better will happen.
Whatever that is,

475
00:31:18,781 --> 00:31:20,520
because the thing is you don't know 
what's better.

476
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:25,230
You don't have the capacity to fully 
realize what would constitute better.

477
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,970
When we've seen that,
as I said,

478
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,260
over and over in the 20th century,
people aim at a circumscribed definition

479
00:31:31,261 --> 00:31:35,130
of what constitutes the Utopian state 
and all we get out of that is endless.

480
00:31:35,131 --> 00:31:38,010
Hell,
we have to pursue what's good,

481
00:31:38,011 --> 00:31:40,770
but we don't know what's what.
What's good is,

482
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:41,933
so how do we,
how do we remove ourselves from that 

483
00:31:45,031 --> 00:31:46,710
paradox?
Well,

484
00:31:46,711 --> 00:31:49,080
it isn't a matter of gathering more 
knowledge.

485
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:49,914
It's a matter of approaching reality in 
a different manner and it is an act of 

486
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:54,534
faith,
his character guard point to code 

487
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:59,700
because if you decide for example that 
you're going to pursue the highest good,

488
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:03,300
whatever that is and the highest good,
pursuing the highest good means.

489
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:07,440
Being willing to transform what your 
conception of the highest good is.

490
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,980
You pursue the highest good.
That's your aim.

491
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,050
Your aim determines the world you live 
in.

492
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,540
We know that that's a fact.
That's a psychological fact.

493
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:21,690
What you aim at determines the nature of
your world and to aim wrong.

494
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:23,710
That's hard.
Markia by the way,

495
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:28,711
that's a great word to a wrong that sin,
because Hamartia,

496
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,303
which is an archery term,
which means to miss the target is what 

497
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:36,890
sin means.
So if you're a not in a state of grace,

498
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:40,160
it means your age wrong.
Naming it the right thing,

499
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,880
or maybe the world is constituted badly 
and it's hell bent on torturing you.

500
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,630
That's the alternative viewpoint.
You got to get your aim right.

501
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:50,810
You name it the best,
and how do you aim?

502
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,213
Well,
the sermon on the mount says something 

503
00:32:54,121 --> 00:32:55,050
very interesting.
It says,

504
00:32:55,051 --> 00:32:55,500
okay,
what?

505
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,710
You get your aim right and you decided 
to tell the truth.

506
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,460
Then all you have to do is concentrate 
on the day.

507
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,730
Now people read the sermon on the mount.
It's a hippy document.

508
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,250
You know,
be like a flower and be like a bird.

509
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,113
Don't pay any attention to the future.
You know everything will be taken care 

510
00:33:13,311 --> 00:33:14,690
of.
It's not that at all.

511
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,300
There's presumptions that are nested in 
there and the presumption is,

512
00:33:17,301 --> 00:33:20,240
first of all,
that you're aiming at at perfection.

513
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,553
You're aiming at whatever perfection is 
and you're not trying to get other 

514
00:33:25,011 --> 00:33:26,630
people to do that.
You're aiming at it.

515
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:30,050
You're reconstituting your actions and 
your speech to aim at that,

516
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,173
and then you do that by noticing very 
carefully and attending to what 

517
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:35,954
constitutes the truth,
and then you let that take you wherever 

518
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:39,584
it will go.
And that's the sacrifice of self to God 

519
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,503
because you the truth is a 
representation of whatever constitutes 

520
00:33:46,761 --> 00:33:47,594
reality,
your best attempt at whatever 

521
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:49,784
constitutes reality and to follow that 
leans to follow something that's 

522
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:55,280
transcendent because whatever reality 
is,

523
00:33:55,281 --> 00:34:00,080
it's certainly not something that you're
individually responsible for creating,

524
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:03,560
even though you might participate in 
that process to speak.

525
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:08,561
The truth is to be guided by being.
It's a completely different motive being

526
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,043
now I said right after Adam and Eve's 
catastrophic emergence into self 

527
00:34:17,991 --> 00:34:21,290
consciousness,
the world split into two attitudes,

528
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:22,124
one associated with pain and the other 
associated with Abel can that those 

529
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:29,870
attitudes are associated with heaven and
hell.

530
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,773
Well,
we know that human beings can turn the 

531
00:34:34,411 --> 00:34:38,210
world into help.
If you're a student of history,

532
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:39,044
you have no doubt about that and no 
matter how terrible you think the hell 

533
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:47,870
that people have created in the past is 
if you read a little more history,

534
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,360
you will find something even more 
terrible.

535
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:56,020
And people of course are afraid of the 
human capacity to turn things into hell.

536
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,400
That that's one of the things that 
underlies our environmental,

537
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,243
isn't.
We're afraid that our misbehavior will 

538
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:03,610
turn the world into help,
will be,

539
00:35:03,611 --> 00:35:08,611
we believe we can do that.
Do we believe that human beings can turn

540
00:35:09,861 --> 00:35:12,290
the world into heaven?
Well,

541
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:13,124
that's a harder thing to believe it 
because there's a lot more ways that 

542
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:15,704
things could go wrong.
Then there are ways that things can go 

543
00:35:17,121 --> 00:35:17,954
right,
so heaven's a much narrower thing to a 

544
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:22,700
map than hell,
which is a chaotic mess.

545
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,753
Well,

546
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,990
maybe it's improbable,
but life is improbable.

547
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,853
That's for sure,
and our unredeemed state of being is 

548
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:35,634
improbable and the other that's 
improbable is the burden that we're 

549
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:41,490
required to carry.
Existentially,

550
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:45,240
we're,
we're awake creatures of God.

551
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,100
What does that mean?

552
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,253
Oh,
that we suffer and it's real that 

553
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:55,210
suffering,
and it's not only that we suffer in that

554
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,053
we feel pain,
which is bad enough in frustration and 

555
00:35:57,591 --> 00:35:58,424
disappointment and all of the 
catastrophic things that are associated 

556
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,310
with life,
but even worse,

557
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,670
we can apprehend the possibility of that
recurring in the future.

558
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:08,840
So even when none of those terrible 
things happen to be happening right now,

559
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:09,973
it's pretty easy for us to imagine that 
they're going to happen tomorrow and 

560
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,123
they will.
So not only can we imagine that they're 

561
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,110
going to happen again tomorrow,
they are going to happen again tomorrow.

562
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,960
So we're in a state of constant 
unredeemed suffering.

563
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,610
It's a big problem.
And you know,

564
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:23,444
if you think about,
you can't even imagine a state that 

565
00:36:25,071 --> 00:36:28,190
would address that.
It's just too big a problem.

566
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,350
Well,
so then there's another inference in the

567
00:36:32,351 --> 00:36:36,130
new testament and it's hypothesis of a 
metta state,

568
00:36:36,131 --> 00:36:41,131
and the inference is that a life that's 
predicated on constant death and renewal

569
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,643
at every level of being a life that's 
predicated on a search for the truth 

570
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,253
and,
and an attempt to act out the truth and 

571
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:53,124
our life that's associated with the 
sacrifice of self to God produces a 

572
00:36:57,571 --> 00:37:02,571
state of being that so deeply meaningful
that it justifies suffering,

573
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,100
doesn't eliminate suffering.
There's no elimination of suffering.

574
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,523
Nisha said he hasn't.
He who has a why can bear any how and 

575
00:37:18,681 --> 00:37:23,681
what he meant by that was if what you're
aiming at is of sufficient profundity,

576
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,333
it's worth an awful lot of misery to 
participate in the process of bringing 

577
00:37:33,181 --> 00:37:34,014
it about and life has an unbearable 
depth of misery and as a consequence it 

578
00:37:42,171 --> 00:37:47,171
needs a and observe positive aim and the
observed positive aim.

579
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,553
It's positive in the new testament.
It is participation in the process that 

580
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:02,114
transforms earth into heaven,
the generation of the Kingdom of God on 

581
00:38:06,871 --> 00:38:09,720
earth,
and that actually means something.

582
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,263
It means that the state of being that is
described by the parameters that I 

583
00:38:19,751 --> 00:38:20,584
already laid out,
the willingness to engage in Inter 

584
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:30,950
eternal sacrificial death and renewal 
and sacrifice of the self to the highest

585
00:38:31,251 --> 00:38:32,084
value produces a state of being 
subjectively that's associated with 

586
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:42,751
habitation in the Kingdom of God and the
actions that are conducted in that state

587
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,033
are what?
Transform the interpersonal state into 

588
00:38:48,551 --> 00:38:53,170
the political state.
That's a manifestation of that kingdom.

589
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,543
Now you all know this.
You know this the same way that the 

590
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:01,124
people who wrote the Bible know what,
because of course people just like you 

591
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,100
wrote the Bible in the Bible is about 
people.

592
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,170
When you have a deeply meaningful 
conversation with someone,

593
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,673
you change them and you change yourself.
You know that and the process that 

594
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:20,944
you're engaged in,
while you have that deeply meaningful 

595
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:23,104
conversation,
that's a mode of being and that motive 

596
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,453
being to the degree that that have 
motive being is predicated on the 

597
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:31,954
attempt to communicate as truthfully as 
possible and with the highest possible 

598
00:39:37,571 --> 00:39:41,470
end in mind.
Then right then and there,

599
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:42,363
you're in that state.
Now you can tell when you're in that 

600
00:39:45,991 --> 00:39:48,840
state because number one,
you're not self conscious.

601
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,200
Time disappears.
Number two,

602
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,600
what you're engaged in is deeply 
meaningful.

603
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,293
You don't bear the tragic burden of your
life at that moment because what's 

604
00:40:01,321 --> 00:40:02,154
happening with you is so worthwhile that
it consumes you completely and people 

605
00:40:09,811 --> 00:40:14,811
are in that state to a widely varying 
degree,

606
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,163
but everyone is in it.
Sometimes when something like that 

607
00:40:20,721 --> 00:40:24,920
happens to you,
especially once you learn to notice it,

608
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:27,243
you think

609
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:34,050
while there's nothing better than that,
and if there's nothing better than that,

610
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:40,510
then you might ask yourself,
why do anything else now?

611
00:40:43,221 --> 00:40:46,070
I've tried to figure that out.
I've tried to figure that out for years.

612
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:48,140
It's like,
because to me,

613
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:52,250
these look like existential realities.
They're not hypothetical states.

614
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:57,080
They're not shoved off into some 
transcendent heaven.

615
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:01,100
They're not other worldly.
They're part of being itself.

616
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:02,983
People can enter states of heaven and 
hell and they can learn to stay longer 

617
00:41:08,691 --> 00:41:09,524
in one state or another,
so why don't they stay in the best 

618
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:15,370
possible state?

619
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,813
Well,

620
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:20,403
one problem is the commitment of faith.
I think it's very terrifying to let go 

621
00:41:24,431 --> 00:41:27,400
of the direction of your life and say,
well,

622
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:31,480
I'm going to go wherever the attempt to 
speak the truth will pick me because God

623
00:41:31,481 --> 00:41:35,240
only knows where you're going to end up 
and it's certainly not where you think.

624
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,283
In fact,
the willingness to abandoned going to 

625
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,910
where you think is a prerequisite for 
doing this,

626
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,273
and so in a sense you're.
You're a ship that the wind takes 

627
00:41:48,501 --> 00:41:49,334
wherever it wants to take,
and the second problem I think is that 

628
00:41:53,171 --> 00:41:58,171
it's a real responsibility because in 
order to undertake this process,

629
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:06,630
you have to come to terms with the idea 
that what you do in your life,

630
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,860
you're wretched,
miserable,

631
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:12,660
tragic prone life actually matters.
Really it matters.

632
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,023
You know when people complain about 
meaninglessness in their life all the 

633
00:42:16,531 --> 00:42:18,060
time,
but I think that's,

634
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,223
that's a kind of face saving illusion.
I think people are more afraid of 

635
00:42:24,471 --> 00:42:28,310
meaning than they are of meaninglessness
because of meaningless means.

636
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,540
Meaninglessness means,
well,

637
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:30,374
I can do whatever I want.
I mean it might be kind of second rate 

638
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,870
and might be dull.
It might be dangerous,

639
00:42:35,871 --> 00:42:38,720
it might be destructive,
but it doesn't matter.

640
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,570
So I can do whatever I want.
I have no responsibility because I don't

641
00:42:41,571 --> 00:42:42,404
mean anything,
so I'm not responsible to anything or 

642
00:42:46,071 --> 00:42:46,904
anyone.
But if your life actually has meaning 

643
00:42:48,411 --> 00:42:51,380
and it doesn't always have meaning,
it has meaning.

644
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,600
When you're doing something that's 
meaningful,

645
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:57,920
well then all of a sudden you are 
responsible to a higher power,

646
00:42:57,921 --> 00:42:58,754
so to speak.
You're responsible to your own soul and 

647
00:43:02,241 --> 00:43:05,990
you're responsible to the state of being
that characterizes the world itself,

648
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:10,340
and that's a massive,
massive responsibility.

649
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:17,500
It's to take responsibility in a sense.
It's to take responsibility for the sins

650
00:43:17,501 --> 00:43:18,334
of the world,
which is another prerequisite of the 

651
00:43:20,381 --> 00:43:22,300
motive being that's described in the new
testaments,

652
00:43:22,301 --> 00:43:23,134
a very strange idea.
The redeemer takes on the sins of the 

653
00:43:25,481 --> 00:43:27,010
world.
What does that mean?

654
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,533
Well,
it means,

655
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,633
oh,
human beings are Nazis and human beings 

656
00:43:34,681 --> 00:43:35,514
are the red garden.
Human beings are the slaughterers in 

657
00:43:40,711 --> 00:43:41,544
Rwanda and we're all human beings,
and so to take on the sins of the world 

658
00:43:46,411 --> 00:43:47,244
means to realize that all those things 
that characterize the human capacity to 

659
00:43:50,341 --> 00:43:53,190
turn the earth into hell characterize 
you,

660
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,253
and then in order to live properly,
you have to live in a manner that 

661
00:43:58,141 --> 00:44:00,960
addresses those elements of your nature.

662
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,400
And again,
that's it.

663
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:06,910
That's a terrible responsibility.
Well,

664
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:08,560
first of all,
who wants to admit that?

665
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:12,640
Second of all,
who can stand looking at it and third,

666
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,680
who's going to take on the burden of 
solving it?

667
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:17,723
Well,
it better be all of us or we're just 

668
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:23,290
going to keep doing it.
So redemption,

669
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,280
what?
What does it mean?

670
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:29,770
It means we're not in a state of grace.
Why?

671
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:34,923
We're self conscious.
We're aware of the owner of the tragedy 

672
00:44:36,851 --> 00:44:37,684
of our being.
We're unwilling to take full 

673
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:40,594
responsibility for it or were ignorant 
about how to do that and that leaves us 

674
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,670
bereft.
How do we solve that?

675
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,910
Well,
we can solve it with a estate,

676
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,810
but the problem is the state is not 
reliable.

677
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,210
It degenerated into tyranny.
Then it transforms into chaos.

678
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:04,530
Then it reconstitutes itself and does 
the same thing again.

679
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,330
It's not a good answer.
Is there another answer?

680
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,980
Well,
maybe.

681
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,073
I believe that what is outlined in 
narrative form in the new testament is 

682
00:45:22,441 --> 00:45:23,274
psychologically correct.
I believe that the idea that endless 

683
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:29,483
micro death and renewal produces a state
of proper ad outpatient to being and 

684
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,070
that the prerequisites for that that are
laid out in the narrative structure that

685
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,980
underlies the new testament are 
fundamentally correct.

686
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:47,790
So to be redeemed is to aim at the 
highest value,

687
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,733
to sacrifice what's no longer useful and
valid in yourself and to tell the truth 

688
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:57,813
and the consequence of that is existence
in a deep state of meaning that 

689
00:46:01,621 --> 00:46:02,454
justifies the tragedy of being and the 
possibility of transforming your own 

690
00:46:07,111 --> 00:46:07,944
life in the most beneficial,
positive direction while simultaneously 

691
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:16,050
doing that for the people around you.
And that's redemption.

692
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,900
Thank you very much.

693
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:25,090
Thank you.
