1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,480
So our next speaker certainly does not 
need any introduction.

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:09,763
He is the man you cornered by his seat.
He is the man you cornered in the foyer 

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,640
and he is the man you cornered outside 
the bathroom.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,990
So please put your hands together for 
Dr. Peterson.

5
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,030
So I was kind of perplexed about what I 
was going to say today because I'm not a

6
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:44,610
media expert by any stretch of the 
imagination.

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,473
But,
uh,

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,673
I was speaking with Jonathan Patio this 
morning because he's staying in the 

9
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,020
same,
same airbnb is my wife and I,

10
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:57,021
and he suggested that I talk to you 
about my experiences with media over the

11
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,221
last year.
And I thought,

12
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:02,370
well that's a,
that's something I know about.

13
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:03,204
So it's always good when you're talking 
to people to talk to some talk about 

14
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:07,134
something that you know about.
That's actually a really good tip for 

15
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:10,710
public speaking,
right?

16
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,720
Well,
it's really true.

17
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:16,020
You have to remember that you should 
know about three times as much about the

18
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:19,860
topic as,
as you need to talk about the topic.

19
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:21,780
And then you have places you can go and 
you know,

20
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:24,900
you can wander round a little bit and be
a little spontaneous.

21
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,300
So that's really useful.
And um,

22
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,163
but then I also thought that makes sense
because nobody knows anything about the 

23
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:36,000
situation with regards to the media now.
And so we're all feeling our way.

24
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,133
And so because the technological 
transformations are so rapid and you 

25
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:41,094
know,
they're going to come one after the 

26
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:44,880
other in the next 10 years,
I don't think we can even imagine what's

27
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:48,270
coming down the pipes and we're all 
struggling to keep up.

28
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:49,104
And you know,
we don't even know how much of the 

29
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,234
current state of more radical political 
polarization is actually a secondary 

30
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,614
consequence of technological 
transformations that we don't 

31
00:01:57,571 --> 00:01:59,910
understand.
Because I was thinking today about,

32
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,403
you know,
about facebook and about twitter and 

33
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:06,150
about youtube and about the idea that 
people are in an echo chamber.

34
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:08,370
And I'm not really sure that's the right
metaphor.

35
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:11,400
I think we might be in an amplifier 
rather than an echo chamber.

36
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,683
You know,
and I've thought for a long time that 

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,313
when I'm,
when I'm thinking about the effect of 

38
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:18,084
the individual,
I read something that Solzhenitsyn said 

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,990
at one point,
and I think he was citing a,

40
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,183
an ancient Christian theologian who 
defined the universe as a place that's 

41
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,260
whose circumference was nowhere and 
whose center was everywhere.

42
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,880
And I really liked that idea.
It's,

43
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,300
and I think it's actually relatively 
true from a technical perspective,

44
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,283
like from a physical perspective,
but Solzhenitsyn pointed out that each 

45
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:44,050
of us was to be regarded as a center of 
the Cosmos and,

46
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,740
and that we have the power that's 
associated with that.

47
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:47,574
And I've thought about that a lot 
because there's something about it 

48
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:50,140
that's,
that's,

49
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,683
it's either obviously true or it's true 
enough so that we all acted out when we 

50
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,124
interact with each other because we 
treat each other like conscious beings 

51
00:02:58,501 --> 00:02:59,334
who have a destiny and hand who have 
choices and who make choices that are 

52
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:06,400
important and who make choices that can 
be good or bad or even good and evil.

53
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,050
We all act like that.
So we,

54
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:12,520
we act that out.
And I was thinking that you can think of

55
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:14,290
network models in that way.
You know,

56
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,463
um,
you can think of human beings as like 9 

57
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,710
billion dots in a row and there's no 
connections between the dots.

58
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:21,544
And then you're sorta like a dust mote 
in the wind and who the hell cares what 

59
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:26,980
you think anyways and you don't have any
impact on things.

60
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:27,814
Or you can recognize that you're at the 
center of a network system and that you 

61
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:32,374
know,
you know a thousand people or you will 

62
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:34,414
in your lifetime or perhaps more than a 
thousand people and then they know a 

63
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,283
thousand people.
So you're separated by one person from 

64
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:43,930
1,000,002 people from a billion.
And that's a much better way to think.

65
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,793
And we are seriously networked together 
and we're networked together more now 

66
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:49,900
than we ever have beaten.

67
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,733
And so one of the things that that might
mean is that the choices you make are 

68
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:59,740
amplified and distributed not only far 
faster than they ever have been,

69
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:02,110
but with far more impact.
And you know,

70
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:02,944
one of the things that Carl Jung pointed
out was that when he had this idea that 

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,730
when science split that that elk,
you know,

72
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,050
is the root of science in some sense,
it's this dream like sub straight out of

73
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:15,390
which science emerged.
And,

74
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,563
but alchemy was kind of a weird ad 
mixture of religious thinking and 

75
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:20,044
scientific thinking because those two 
things hadn't been differentiated back 

76
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:26,050
when there were alchemists.
And Ewan believed that what had happened

77
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:26,771
in,
in Europe,

78
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:27,604
at least first was that the scientific 
and developing me blew up and expanded 

79
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:32,524
at an exponential rate.
And that led to this advanced 

80
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:35,314
technological civilization that we have.
But that the moral dimension that was 

81
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,020
embedded in the religious symbolism 
didn't develop at all.

82
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,853
And so we're in this unstable situation 
where we're far more technologically 

83
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:46,744
proficient than we are wise.
And that that's actually a big problem 

84
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:53,020
because obviously the more powerful the 
tools you generate,

85
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,350
the more intelligent ethically you 
better be or things are going to really,

86
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,253
uh,
are,

87
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,480
are going to go to hell in a handbasket 
very,

88
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,920
very rapidly.
You know,

89
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,950
and I had this thought,
I think I shared a little bit last night

90
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:06,761
that,
you know,

91
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:08,530
in the next five years,
six years,

92
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:11,440
we're going to develop pretty viciously 
intelligent ai systems.

93
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:12,780
And that's already happening.
You know,

94
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,633
I mean,
they're monitoring youtube and they're 

95
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:15,484
monitoring facebook and they're 
monitoring google and they're trying to 

96
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:19,210
make ethical decisions,
these ai systems.

97
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:20,044
And the problem is,
is that the ethical presuppositions of 

98
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:25,870
the programmers are being embedded into 
the infrastructure of the net.

99
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,033
And that's a hell of a thing to think 
because it means that for better or 

100
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:31,780
worse,
we're building automated intelligence is

101
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,370
that reflect our own morality.

102
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,743
And we better be very careful about what
our morality is if we're going to 

103
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:39,520
automate it.
Because automated systems are incredibly

104
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:40,540
powerful.
So,

105
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,220
so that's,
that's kind of,

106
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,083
that's where we're at,
at least to some degree in terms of the 

107
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:50,440
new technological transformations with 
in communication technology.

108
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,940
You know,
it puts each of us at the,

109
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,073
at the center of a wide web of 
connections and makes the consequences 

110
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:59,330
of our moral decisions much more 
immediately manifest to each of us.

111
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,293
And it kind of begs the question too,
like how should you behave on facebook 

112
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:03,914
and how should you behave on twitter?
I think twitter drives me a little bit 

113
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:08,240
crazy,
you know,

114
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,243
um,
I'm on at a fair bit and I'm not sure 

115
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:14,900
it's a good thing.
And I tend to distribute things that are

116
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,393
alarming,
let's say in some sense maybe they are 

117
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:18,704
alarming,
ideological or ideologically they're 

118
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:21,434
disturbing.

119
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,860
And I was thinking about that today in 
preparation for this talk.

120
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:25,694
And I wasn't really sure that was 
necessarily a good idea because there 

121
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:31,940
are a lot of alarming things happening 
all the time,

122
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,580
everywhere obviously.
Um,

123
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,390
and now we can share all of them always 
all the time.

124
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,710
And so that means that instead of 
hearing about one alarming thing a day,

125
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:45,350
you're hearing about like 500 alarming 
things a day.

126
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:47,060
And so then,
you know,

127
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,040
what are you supposed to do about that?
Is that,

128
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,010
does that indicate the state that 
there's a state of emergency?

129
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,143
Well,
you don't know cause you don't know how 

130
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:56,180
to calibrate the information.
So I was thinking,

131
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:57,014
well maybe the right way to behave on 
twitter is only two forward good things 

132
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:01,160
that are happening.
You know,

133
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:03,080
cause there's lots of good things that 
are happening.

134
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,000
But I actually don't know the answer to 
that.

135
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,830
I,
I have no idea and I don't think anybody

136
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:07,664
else does either.
I do know that there are studies with 

137
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:13,160
regards to facebook that show that the 
more time that you spend on facebook,

138
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:13,994
the more depressed you are and that it 
looks like it's a causal relationship 

139
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:18,920
rather than just a correlational 
relationship.

140
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:19,754
And it seems to have something to do 
with the fact that facebook is one of 

141
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:26,150
those platforms where everybody puts up 
an advertisement for their life,

142
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:26,900
right?
It's like,

143
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,733
here I am with my new girlfriend in The 
Bahamas being happy and here I am in a 

144
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:32,660
mountain being happy.
And it's like,

145
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,840
it's not you like miserable with the 
cover over your head,

146
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,670
unable to get out of bed.
You don't,

147
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,040
you don't,
you don't broadcast that.

148
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,210
You can think,
well,

149
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,200
I means you're presenting people with a 
falsely positive view of your life.

150
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,830
And then they compare their lives to it 
and they come up short and you think,

151
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:52,250
well that's a kind of deception.
But by the same token,

152
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:53,084
you don't stop random strangers on the 
street and tell them how miserable your 

153
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:56,120
life is.
Right?

154
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,530
They don't want to hear about that.
They,

155
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,650
they want to see a facade of normality 
in,

156
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:01,490
in,
in,

157
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,130
you know,
just casual day to day interactions.

158
00:08:04,131 --> 00:08:08,810
And so part of prosocial behavior is 
only to put what's at least,

159
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,970
you know,
normative and good forward.

160
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,760
So it doesn't matter.
I mean,

161
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,770
so I don't think that's necessarily 
deception,

162
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:16,604
but the mass consequence of that is 
something that we don't understand at 

163
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,330
all.
And so,

164
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,030
well,
so with that sort of introduction,

165
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:23,864
I'm going to kind of walk you through my
experience with social media and let's 

166
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:30,380
say the old media,
for lack of a better word,

167
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:33,200
and I'll try to give you a balanced 
account and to tell you,

168
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:34,843
well,
it's to see if I can draw some 

169
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:39,170
conclusions about what's happened to me,
my life.

170
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,003
For the last year has been so busy that 
I haven't had proper time to reflect on 

171
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:45,860
what's been happening.
And even if I did,

172
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:46,694
I wouldn't,
I'm not exactly sure I would be able to 

173
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:50,990
understand it anyways because it isn't 
sure.

174
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,913
I'm not,
I don't think I have a framework of 

175
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:53,744
reference within which to put it.
So I started working for this company 

176
00:08:57,991 --> 00:09:01,800
called Television TV Ontario About 15,
16 years ago.

177
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,860
I had talked to a producer,
his name was Waldeck Shimberg.

178
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,430
He's a emigrate Polish Jew in a really 
smart guy.

179
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,833
And uh,
he phoned me up at the university and 

180
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,103
one of the things that distinguishes me 
to some degree from my colleagues is 

181
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:16,434
that I'll talk to the press and that I'm
actually not afraid of them or 

182
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,380
distrustful of them.
Like a lot of my colleagues,

183
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:25,680
not all of them are like,
they're critical of the press,

184
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,560
partly in an arrogant way and partly in 
a defensive way.

185
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:28,951
They say,
well,

186
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:30,900
they always get it wrong.
It's like,

187
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:31,471
well,
first of all,

188
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:34,290
there isn't a day and they don't always 
get it wrong.

189
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,170
And you know,
they,

190
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,013
they,
they'll also shy away from the press as 

191
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:41,610
if they're being intruded upon when the 
truth is generally speaking.

192
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,983
The idea is that they're putting forward
aren't of sufficient interest to draw 

193
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:47,310
public attention anyways.
And so,

194
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:52,300
but I talked to what EC for a long time 
and he invited me to go on a couple of,

195
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,690
of shows and then uh,
um,

196
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,003
then I ended up on TV shows the agenda,
which is a pretty good public affairs 

197
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,870
show.
It's one of the few,

198
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,950
I would say deep new shows left that,
that,

199
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:07,110
that are on normal broadcast tv and you 
know,

200
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:07,944
they go into issues in some depth,
although they fragmented that up a bit 

201
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:11,214
in recent years.
And I became a fairly common guest on 

202
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,360
those shows and people seem to like what
I was saying,

203
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:19,530
which always surprised me.

204
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,180
I mean,
but,

205
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,073
but it was good because you know,
it must be pretty damn horrible to put 

206
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:29,421
yourself out in the public eye and face 
primary criticism for what you're doing.

207
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:32,400
I think that would be unbearable in some
sense unless you were very,

208
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:35,310
very strongly constituted.
And then,

209
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,933
well,
that went on for a while and we'll deck 

210
00:10:38,161 --> 00:10:41,760
was running this a series called big 
ideas,

211
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,620
which was actually quite prescient,
you know,

212
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:48,621
so he had lecturers come to Toronto and,
and he had all pretty much all the major

213
00:10:49,411 --> 00:10:50,244
public intellectuals in the world over a
period of about five years or six years 

214
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:53,874
or so,
come and deliver bare bones lectures of 

215
00:10:56,971 --> 00:11:00,180
this sort fundamentally need taped them 
and put them on tv,

216
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,080
you know,
and,

217
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,510
and uh,
that was sort of unheard of.

218
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,373
The production quality was well high,
but not overproduced weren't multiple 

219
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:09,024
cameras and edits and,
and intelligent commentary from people 

220
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:12,840
in the background.

221
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,630
It was purely content driven,
you know,

222
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:16,464
and it actually got pretty popular on,
on itunes and you can still find the 

223
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:23,490
lectures there,
but Tvo couldn't they,

224
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:24,301
they,
they,

225
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:25,134
they,
they pulled the show even though their 

226
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:27,923
primary,
a mandate from the government was to 

227
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:32,730
educate the public.
And this was a very low budget show with

228
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:33,564
very high quality minds that people were
actually watching and downloading a lot 

229
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:38,454
on itunes,
but they didn't seem to take the 

230
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:44,190
nonstandard media with any degree of 
seriousness.

231
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:47,070
And you know,
that's kind of a common human attribute,

232
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,600
which is that if you don't know about 
something,

233
00:11:48,601 --> 00:11:50,310
you don't take it seriously.
Right.

234
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:51,870
And it's because if you don't know about
it,

235
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:54,760
well it's just gray and fuzzy,
right to you.

236
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,420
You have no differentiated knowledge.
So it's easy to oversimplify it.

237
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:01,960
And I think part of the problem with the
classical media,

238
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:02,794
let's say,
trying to make a transition to the 

239
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:07,750
digital age is that they have no idea 
what the digital media is.

240
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,500
Like.
I was watching an MSNBC,

241
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,860
a clip the other day about this robot.
I think her name is Sophia,

242
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:15,870
who,
who,

243
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,703
who has a fairly advanced degree of 
artificial intelligence and who can 

244
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:22,780
manifest pretty realistic human facial 
emotions.

245
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,470
And uh,
it was a four minute clip and had a 32nd

246
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:28,960
ad at the beginning of it and you 
couldn't skip the ad.

247
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:32,470
And I thought there's a real arrogance 
on the part of the MBA,

248
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,363
ms NBC people to put that on Youtube.
Because anybody who's familiar with the 

249
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:38,260
youtube,
let's say,

250
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:39,094
culture knows that what you get to put a
ten second ad on and then you get to 

251
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:43,504
skip it after five seconds if you want.
Like you can't ask people to pay 30 

252
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:50,050
seconds of attention for four minutes of
content.

253
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:51,900
It violates the norms.
And so it,

254
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:52,734
it only had about 12,000 views.
And that's a really interesting example 

255
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:59,530
of Marshall Mcluhan's idea that the 
medium is the message,

256
00:12:59,531 --> 00:12:59,740
right?

257
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,960
As you build a new technological 
infrastructure.

258
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,123
And it's sort of like the old thing 
because youtube is sort of like a TV 

259
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:06,874
network,
but it's also not like a TV network at 

260
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,480
all,
partly for example,

261
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:12,040
because when you put something on 
Youtube,

262
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:12,874
it's permanent.
And that's way different than broadcast 

263
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:16,660
TV.
Like it's raw,

264
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,690
it's seriously revolutionarily 
different.

265
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,820
And so,
and it's also the case to that then this

266
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:28,090
is a strange thing and I don't think the
classic media understands this either,

267
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:30,760
is that youtube people don't like high 
production values.

268
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,620
In fact,
they're very cynical about them.

269
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,723
And I think that's because they've come 
to identify advanced editing and Glitz 

270
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,130
as markers that the information is 
actually being manipulated,

271
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,130
which of course it is now for better or 
worse.

272
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:47,530
I mean editing doesn't have to be 
manipulating,

273
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:49,810
but it certainly can be.
And so,

274
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,020
and besides that,
a lot of the more tech savvy people that

275
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:53,854
watch youtube can duplicate those sort 
of special effects in their own home in 

276
00:13:56,561 --> 00:13:57,250
half an hour.

277
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,270
So they're not there.
They're no longer markers of the kind of

278
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,980
competence and technological prowess 
that would signal the sort of competence

279
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:08,380
that you could trust.
So,

280
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,303
so what youtube viewers seem to like is 
basically ordinary people more or less 

281
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,473
trying to have an intelligent 
conversation about something confusing 

282
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,624
and important and the,
the attention span that people are 

283
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:23,674
willing to devote to that is actually 
quite remarkable for for a medium that 

284
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:29,590
was nothing but cute cat videos say five
years ago.

285
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,633
The fact that like a lot of my lectures 
and like Joe Rogan's podcast like three 

286
00:14:33,701 --> 00:14:35,920
hours long,
it's like what the hell?

287
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:39,610
People weren't supposed to have that 
capacity to pay attention in this era of

288
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:41,950
fragmented attention,
you know,

289
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:44,440
in Rogan,
I don't know if you know this or not.

290
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,193
Um,
he has 120 million downloads a month 

291
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:52,490
now.
So that's 1.5 billion downloads a year.

292
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,880
And so the last time I saw him,
and that was with Brett who just spoke,

293
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,380
um,
I,

294
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,680
I asked him what it was like to be the 
most powerful interview or the world has

295
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:02,960
ever seen because I think he probably 
is,

296
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:06,830
if you think about it and sheer numbers,
I mean maybe Walter cronkite back in the

297
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,680
60s had some comparable influence,
but he said,

298
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:10,850
I just don't think about it.

299
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,320
And like,
what,

300
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:14,030
what the hell is he supposed to think 
about it?

301
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,550
Because no one knows what to think about
that.

302
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,510
And so he just has the conversations and
posts some and away he goes,

303
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:21,344
but he has no idea what role he's 
currently playing in society and we 

304
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:28,730
don't have proper metrics for measuring 
it and we don't understand it at all.

305
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,570
So anyways,
I did these big idea lectures with,

306
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,750
with air con and they were ranked on,
on uh,

307
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,693
the Dvo channel and the five lectures or
six lectures I did all ended up in the 

308
00:15:41,661 --> 00:15:43,820
top 20,
which really surprised me.

309
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:47,510
But it was an indication that there was 
something about what I was talking about

310
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,050
that for which there was a market and 
now there's,

311
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,550
there's some reasons for that.
I think,

312
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:53,660
you know what,
when I,

313
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,800
I wrote a book from 1984 to 1999 called 
maps of meaning.

314
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,420
And a lot of the things I talk about 
come out of all the reading I did during

315
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:03,254
that period because I was reading an 
insane amount and thinking really 

316
00:16:06,111 --> 00:16:06,944
nonstop 16 hours a day.
Like the only way I could stop myself 

317
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:11,540
from thinking was to go work out with 
weights.

318
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,374
I couldn't shut off my,
my concern with the issues that I was 

319
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:19,010
dealing with and I was spending about 
three hours a day writing and I did that

320
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,250
everyday for 15 years and that was the 
consequences.

321
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,320
That was the book.
And

322
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,863
the writing also helped a tremendous 
amount because it helps clarify your 

323
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:30,920
thinking,
writing,

324
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,873
you know,
because actually you're smarter when 

325
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:33,711
you,
right?

326
00:16:33,711 --> 00:16:37,730
Because you can externalize your 
thoughts and then you can,

327
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:38,803
you can use your working memory to 
analyze what you've written instead of 

328
00:16:41,061 --> 00:16:43,280
remembering the thought.
And so you're,

329
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:44,630
you're externalizing your memory.

330
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,970
You can analyze what you thought,
you can refine it,

331
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,103
you can reorder it.
You can edit like mad with a word 

332
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:52,940
processor,
which is also a very new thing to it.

333
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:53,774
Editing is very difficult if you have to
do that with pen and paper with a 

334
00:16:55,851 --> 00:16:56,601
typewriter,
it's like,

335
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:59,150
forget it.
You get your first draft and that's it.

336
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,733
And so,
but what I was doing with maps of 

337
00:17:02,631 --> 00:17:04,880
meaning was I was trying to solve a 
problem.

338
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:05,714
And the problem was it was the problem 
as far as I was concerned that underlie 

339
00:17:09,681 --> 00:17:14,570
the conflict between the Western world 
and the communist world essentially.

340
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,973
And that problem was,
well the reason it was a problem was 

341
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:21,260
because we were so highly armed,
even as we are now.

342
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:24,860
And of course that problem is 
manifesting itself once again with North

343
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,100
Korea that might render everything we're
talking about completely irrelevant,

344
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:28,370
right?

345
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:32,090
We cause we don't know which catastrophe
is the one most worth worrying about,

346
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,373
but I was interested in the conflict 
between the communist way of looking at 

347
00:17:38,331 --> 00:17:40,250
the world and the Western way of looking
at the world.

348
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:41,084
And I think I actually had a postmodern 
concern with that because one of the 

349
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:45,074
things I was curious about was,
well the world is susceptible to a 

350
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:50,064
multitude of interpretations and 
opinions and the Communist 

351
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:53,604
interpretation is one form of 
interpretation and the western 

352
00:17:57,181 --> 00:17:58,014
capitalist democratic form of 
interpretation is another form of 

353
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:01,884
interpretation.
And is there any grounds on which you 

354
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:05,904
can determine that one of those is 
superior to the other or more correct 

355
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:10,314
than the other?
Or is it a matter purely of opinion and 

356
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:13,674
social organization or maybe even 
warfare to determine who's going to be 

357
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:17,544
the victor?
Maybe there's no other way of 

358
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,720
determining who's going to be the victor
then actual conflict.

359
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,093
It's certainly possible.
And so I started to look underneath 

360
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:29,700
belief structures and I didn't know you 
could do that really to begin with.

361
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,400
You know,
my first degree was in political science

362
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:33,234
and I kind of wandered out of that when 
the professors kept insisting to me in 

363
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:40,710
the upper years of my studies that all 
of the conflict between human beings was

364
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:41,544
driven by economic disparity.
And I just never bought that because 

365
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,270
that's like saying that people fight 
about what they value.

366
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,400
And for me that just begged the question
of,

367
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:51,630
well yeah,
a fair enough.

368
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,670
Obviously it's,
it's,

369
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,513
it's almost self evident.
But the real question is why do they 

370
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:59,790
value what they value?
Because human beings are quite a diverse

371
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:00,624
lot and it's not self evident why we 
value some things rather than other 

372
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:05,250
things.
Like if you're starving to death,

373
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:07,200
it's obvious that you're going to value 
food.

374
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,820
But that's a limit case.
You know,

375
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:10,500
it's,
it's not that interesting.

376
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,361
So it's,
it's,

377
00:19:11,361 --> 00:19:12,194
it's too simplified.
So I didn't find that a compelling 

378
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:22,050
explanation and I still don't,
I think the economic explanation for,

379
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:26,160
for human conflict is,
is shallow and tautological even.

380
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,590
And then I started to read some people 
whose,

381
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,463
whose writings really gripped me.
And I think that's an interesting 

382
00:19:32,941 --> 00:19:33,930
phenomenon.
You know,

383
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,350
and I was studying psychology by this 
point.

384
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:40,510
I switched into psychology and,
um,

385
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,560
I was starting to read the 
psychoanalysts and I really got,

386
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,690
I really got interested in what they had
to say,

387
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,103
um,
partly from reading Freud because I was 

388
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:52,590
really interested in his analysis of 
family dynamics and have dreams,

389
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,750
but more particularly from reading 
young.

390
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,760
And one of the things I learned from 
young,

391
00:19:56,761 --> 00:20:00,390
which really has never ceased to shock 
me,

392
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,100
was his,
see,

393
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:03,390
he basically made a point.

394
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,080
And the point was that you're not master
in your own house.

395
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,093
That there are forces that are,
are operating on you at an unconscious 

396
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,780
level that determine,
for example,

397
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,810
the direction of your attention.
So for example,

398
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:19,644
you know how sometimes you'll read 
something to really grip you and then 

399
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:24,840
you'll read something else and you like,
you can't even concentrate on it.

400
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,100
And you might say,
well,

401
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:29,220
I need to concentrate on this boring 
thing,

402
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,263
you know,
cause an exam depends on it or a 

403
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,124
promotion.
And there's just no damn way you're 

404
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,890
reading it and your attention flips all 
over the place and,

405
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,950
and you know you're undisciplined and 
all that.

406
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:38,784
But,
but then you have this other thing and 

407
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:41,610
it just grips you like this and you 
think,

408
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:42,444
okay,
well what,

409
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,020
what's doing that?
It's not your will.

410
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,273
Because your would be the thing that 
would allow you to concentrate on 

411
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,520
whatever you chose to concentrate on.

412
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,713
It's something underneath your will 
that's actually directing your 

413
00:20:54,941 --> 00:20:56,650
attention.
And you could say,

414
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:58,810
well it's random,
but of course it's not.

415
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:02,110
It's maybe random if you have a serious 
case of schizophrenia.

416
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,273
But,
and I think in some sense that's 

417
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:06,340
actually the definition of 
schizophrenia.

418
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,250
But it's not random.
If you're a functioning human being,

419
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,353
the thing that grips your attention and 
directs it to one place or another is 

420
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:14,434
something that's what's a deep instinct.
It's a manifestation of what union 

421
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:19,930
called the self,
which is a very interesting idea.

422
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:22,600
So human thought,
this is such a cool idea.

423
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,913
He thought that the mechanism that 
directed your attention in the present 

424
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:31,480
was your future self attempting to 
manifest itself in the present world.

425
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,583
So you might say,
well you have a potential and that 

426
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:36,274
potential is what you could be in time.
And in order for that potential to 

427
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:42,670
manifest itself,
it has to be palpable in the present.

428
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,833
And the way that instinct for further 
develop manifests itself in the present 

429
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:47,884
is by directing your attention towards 
things that are likely to increase your 

430
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:53,020
competence and further your growth right
now.

431
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,140
And that's just an unbelievable idea.
You know,

432
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:56,974
it's like your,
your potential better self beckoning to 

433
00:21:59,741 --> 00:22:01,990
you in the present.
Amazing.

434
00:22:01,991 --> 00:22:04,810
And I really can't think of a better 
explanation for it than that.

435
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:05,644
That's a,
that's a really good explanation but a 

436
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:11,140
very frightening one because it means in
some sense that you're,

437
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,603
that something as fundamental as your 
attention is more or less controlled by 

438
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:16,684
processes that are so deep that you 
don't have a tremendous amount of 

439
00:22:19,091 --> 00:22:22,390
voluntary control over them.
Like you can interact with the forces to

440
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:23,530
some degree,
but you know,

441
00:22:23,531 --> 00:22:27,370
you're not one of those per creatures 
that can just tell yourself what to do.

442
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,130
Life would be really easy if that's what
it was like right here.

443
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,800
It's time to go to the gym three days a 
week,

444
00:22:32,801 --> 00:22:33,970
two hours a day.
It's like,

445
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,130
you know,
you're superman in two years and you can

446
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:37,790
eat properly and you know,
you're,

447
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:40,630
you're not going to drink too much and 
you're not going to take cocaine and all

448
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:42,790
of these things.
You just tell yourself that and bang,

449
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:43,624
you quit.
And it's kind of weird that it isn't 

450
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:48,520
that way,
but it's really seriously not that way.

451
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,373
Anyways,
when I was looking at the difference 

452
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:55,570
between the Communist system in the 
western capitalist system,

453
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:56,404
I started to get underneath the belief 
systems to find out what was there at 

454
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,710
Ewan was extremely,
how helpful and other thinkers that,

455
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,310
I'm sure you've heard me mentioned,
if you've listened to my lectures,

456
00:23:05,311 --> 00:23:06,144
need Shin and dusty,
Husky and social knits and seem to be 

457
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:12,700
the people who had dug deepest down into
those subterranean levels.

458
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,533
And what I found,
I think was that the communist system 

459
00:23:16,151 --> 00:23:18,070
was very,
was very shallow.

460
00:23:18,071 --> 00:23:18,904
It was predicated on a set of rational 
assumptions that were generated by a 

461
00:23:22,031 --> 00:23:26,380
handful of people with no real 
biological here or historical rooting.

462
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,693
Um,
and I think that the fact that that was 

463
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:35,071
the case was part of the reason why when
those ideas unfolded in real time,

464
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,680
they were so murderous.
They just weren't imagine that,

465
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,020
you know,
Karl Marx was thinking,

466
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:42,640
well,
here's the game that we're playing in.

467
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:43,474
Here are the rules.
And so that he laid out the rules 

468
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:49,190
explicitly and then people made 
societies that follow those rules.

469
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,800
And it turned out that that game didn't 
work at all.

470
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,500
He just got it wrong.
And like seriously Ra.

471
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:58,160
Whereas in the west,
the ideas emerged from a,

472
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,930
an unbroken historical process that 
stretches back probably to the beginning

473
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,450
of civilization,
say maybe,

474
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:07,660
maybe all the way back to Africa,
who knows how,

475
00:24:07,661 --> 00:24:09,620
how,
how ancient these ideas are.

476
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,453
And there's,
there's an unbroken con continuity of 

477
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:13,214
ideas that emerged up and that,
and they're expressed in symbolic form 

478
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:17,294
and it's on that symbolic platform,
which actually matches our biology and 

479
00:24:20,781 --> 00:24:24,230
our behavior that are more articulated 
ideas rest upon.

480
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,970
And so I found that extremely useful and
surprising.

481
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:31,300
I mean,
it wasn't what I expected.

482
00:24:31,301 --> 00:24:36,301
And,
and at the same time I was,

483
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:39,590
I was,
I had another problem that emerged while

484
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:44,450
I was dealing with this and one was that
I come to understand what group identity

485
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:45,284
meant to people.
Like you have to have a group identity 

486
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:48,740
because you live with other people and 
LE,

487
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,190
unless you have a shared identity.
Jonathan talked about this a bit.

488
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:56,090
Unless you have a central pole around 
which you're all oriented,

489
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,620
it's all chaotic and confused and you're
in constant conflict and warfare.

490
00:25:00,621 --> 00:25:02,600
It's like that's a bad thing you do.

491
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,690
You do not want that.
And you're all confused individually and

492
00:25:05,691 --> 00:25:07,790
all of that.
That's a state of chaos.

493
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:12,020
It's unbearable.
But if you tighten up the group identity

494
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,990
too great a degree,
say like the Nazis tried to do,

495
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:19,880
then the probability that you'll come to
blows with other groups reaches a almost

496
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:21,740
a point of certainty.
Right?

497
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,933
And so it seemed to me that human beings
were damned if they did and damned if 

498
00:25:25,341 --> 00:25:26,630
they didn't.
On the,

499
00:25:26,631 --> 00:25:29,060
on the one hand,
if you dropped your group identity,

500
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:31,670
then you fragmented and degenerated into
the chaos.

501
00:25:31,671 --> 00:25:34,610
And if you gripped hard to your group 
identity,

502
00:25:34,611 --> 00:25:35,444
then you,
you tilted towards totalitarianism and 

503
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,770
group conflict.
And then I thought,

504
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:40,604
well,
that was okay in the past to tilt 

505
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:44,180
towards group conflict because,
you know,

506
00:25:44,181 --> 00:25:46,360
when we had sticks and swords,
we,

507
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,710
we'd have a war in.
Lots of people would get killed in,

508
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:49,544
lots of people would get hurt,
but the entire planet wouldn't burst 

509
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:52,610
into flames.

510
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:53,443
Right?
So,

511
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,381
you know,
this,

512
00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:55,940
this,
this inborn

513
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,333
dichotomy of,
of catastrophe that characterized human 

514
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,060
existence wasn't something that could 
spiral into complete destruction.

515
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:08,840
And so we could get away with it.
But now in a thermonuclear age,

516
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:11,960
it's like we can't get away with it,
but that's still what we're like.

517
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,560
We're still like that.
And so for months I thought,

518
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:16,260
oh my God,
you know,

519
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,800
I always believed that if you could get 
to the bottom of a problem,

520
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:20,170
you could solve it.
Cause that,

521
00:26:20,171 --> 00:26:22,850
that was sort of the definition of 
getting to the bottom of it.

522
00:26:22,851 --> 00:26:23,440
You know,
you,

523
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:23,751
uh,
uh,

524
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:26,750
solution would emerge.
And when I got to the bottom of it,

525
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,070
as far as I could go,
I thought,

526
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,780
oh,
it's group identity.

527
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:30,614
And like group fostered warfare and 
catastrophe on the one hand and 

528
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,970
degenerate nihilism on the other.
It's like well jigs up.

529
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,833
There's no way out of that.
And I had a prophetic dream at that 

530
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:42,651
point,
which,

531
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:44,280
and I won't tell you the details of 
that,

532
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:45,114
but it outlined a third pass to me that,
that I had already picked up to some 

533
00:26:50,161 --> 00:26:50,994
degree from reading young and also Eric 
[inaudible] who is one of young great 

534
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:56,160
students.
And that was,

535
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,233
that had to do with the embodiment of 
the idea of the hero and the individual 

536
00:27:00,241 --> 00:27:01,074
as the like the pathway of the 
courageous individual as the mediating 

537
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:08,940
force between the chaos of nihilism and 
totalitarianism,

538
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,360
totalitarianism of authority,
authority,

539
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,700
authoritarian certainty that there was a
third path.

540
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:15,863
And then I started to understand its 
relationship to religious thinking 

541
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,540
mostly to Christianity,
but partly because that's my tradition,

542
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,630
you know,
in so far as I'm a western person say,

543
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,793
and I understood as well that it had 
something to do and that this was what 

544
00:27:29,161 --> 00:27:31,420
it was dramatized in the,
in the,

545
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,323
in the,
uh,

546
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,323
in the passion story in the New 
Testament was that it had something to 

547
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:36,684
do with taking responsibility for 
malevolence because Christ is 

548
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,250
architecturally the person who takes the
world's sins upon himself.

549
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,910
And what that means in some sense is 
that if you read about history,

550
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:50,760
read about Nazi Germany,
you read about the Soviet Gulags,

551
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:55,710
you don't read as an observer looking at
what other people have done.

552
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,670
You read as the subject and the object 
of the history.

553
00:27:59,671 --> 00:28:00,504
You're both the person who was 
persecuted and the victimizer at the 

554
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:04,460
same time.
And you,

555
00:28:04,461 --> 00:28:05,294
you have to see both of those inside us 
actual forces in order to understand 

556
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:10,170
history properly.
And of course,

557
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,110
that's a very,
very terrifying thing to do.

558
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,870
It's easier to take the part of victim 
in some sense,

559
00:28:15,871 --> 00:28:17,490
even though that's terrible,
right?

560
00:28:17,491 --> 00:28:20,040
Because who wants to be the victim of a 
concentration camp,

561
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,370
obviously,
but maybe that's preferable ethically to

562
00:28:23,371 --> 00:28:26,460
being the perpetrator.
But when you're reading about Auschwitz,

563
00:28:26,461 --> 00:28:27,294
you're not reading about past history of
reading about exactly what people are 

564
00:28:30,421 --> 00:28:32,940
like.
And that's a very terrifying thing.

565
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,773
And so one of the things you have to do 
if you're going to take responsibility 

566
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:41,520
for the nature of your being is to take 
responsibility for the malevolence.

567
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,250
That's truly part of human nature.
And that's,

568
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:47,640
that's part of the encounter with the 
shadow from the union perspective.

569
00:28:47,641 --> 00:28:48,474
And you know,
one of ewing's proposition was that the 

570
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:52,350
human shadow reaches all the way down to
hell.

571
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,573
And you know,
we're used to thinking of religious 

572
00:28:56,821 --> 00:28:59,850
language maybe even as outdated 
superstition.

573
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:00,684
But if you take that sort of statement 
seriously from a psychological 

574
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:04,254
perspective,
what it means in some sense is that the 

575
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:09,540
malevolence that resides inside you,
at least in potential,

576
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:10,643
is of the same sort as the malevolence 
that produces the worst things that 

577
00:29:13,771 --> 00:29:16,740
human beings have ever done.
And so,

578
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,500
and I couldn't see any way out of that 
argument.

579
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:20,334
I mean,
the more I read about the gulag system 

580
00:29:22,831 --> 00:29:26,670
in the USSR and what happened in China,
what happened in Nazi Germany,

581
00:29:26,671 --> 00:29:27,504
the more it became evident to me that 
these weren't topped down systems 

582
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,900
imposed by tyrants on an unwilling 
innocent population,

583
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:37,350
but decisions on the part of entire 
cultures to go down a certain road.

584
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,423
Often the leaders were following,
which I would say it was particularly 

585
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,183
the case with Hitler,
which isn't to deny him his criminal 

586
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:45,844
culpability,
but Hitler was unbelievably good at 

587
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:51,640
letting the crowd tell him what to say.
You know,

588
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:54,880
he was a,
he was a mirror for the crowd and he was

589
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:57,160
a good orator,
but he paid attention to the crowd.

590
00:29:57,161 --> 00:30:00,310
And so when he said something that made 
everyone cheer,

591
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,193
you know,
they're dark hearts would come out in 

592
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:05,740
the mob and cheer about something he 
said that was say dramatic or,

593
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:06,843
or vengeful.
Well then he'd say more of that and the 

594
00:30:09,401 --> 00:30:12,820
things that he said that were peaceful,
that produced no emotional reaction from

595
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:14,440
the crowd.
He just said less of.

596
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:18,100
And so the crowd taught him over time 
exactly what to sell them.

597
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,670
And that that can be good in some sense.
If a leader does that carefully,

598
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:22,504
that that means he's integrating what 
the crowd wants with his style of 

599
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:26,530
leadership.

600
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,363
But it can be terrible if the mob is the
crowd and the mob is outraged and out 

601
00:30:32,141 --> 00:30:32,974
for blood.
And that's what happened in Nazi 

602
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:36,820
Germany.
And so you can't blame it on Hitler.

603
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:37,683
That's just not reasonable.
It's distributed through the entire 

604
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:44,641
population and the individual level of 
analysis that's most significant and a

605
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,453
well.
So there's malevolence that has to be 

606
00:30:49,361 --> 00:30:50,194
contended with.
And then the other element is that you 

607
00:30:51,611 --> 00:30:53,890
have to contend with the tragedy of 
life.

608
00:30:53,891 --> 00:30:54,724
And that's so in the,
in the passion of the Christ did that 

609
00:30:57,221 --> 00:30:59,800
and that story.
Christ of course encounters Satan in the

610
00:30:59,801 --> 00:31:00,880
desert.
And so that's,

611
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:01,803
and he's tempted there.
And so that's the encounter with evil 

612
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,103
archetypically speaking.
And then the crucifixion itself is the 

613
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:09,550
encounter with the tragedy of life,
right?

614
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:12,220
It's betrayal and death voluntarily 
accepted.

615
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:16,720
And so I understood that that was a 
symbolic representation of the logos and

616
00:31:16,721 --> 00:31:20,140
that that was the they,
what would you say?

617
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:20,973
The embodied manifestation of this 
heroic path that mediated between these 

618
00:31:24,971 --> 00:31:27,160
two extremes.
And I was really useful.

619
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:29,530
Like that was a really useful discovery 
for me.

620
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,130
And because there was implications to it
too,

621
00:31:32,131 --> 00:31:32,964
and,
and,

622
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:33,843
and profound implications that also seem
to work out in relationship to what I 

623
00:31:37,151 --> 00:31:39,760
was learning about clinical psychology.
So for example,

624
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:42,460
one of the things you do if you're a 
clinical psychologist,

625
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:43,294
as you help people learn to encounter 
things that they're afraid of in a 

626
00:31:47,501 --> 00:31:50,680
controlled manner and they get less,
they don't get less afraid,

627
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:51,514
they get braver.
So you actually act out the process of 

628
00:31:53,771 --> 00:31:54,604
confrontation with tragedy,
voluntary conference question with 

629
00:31:56,591 --> 00:31:58,210
tragedy.
And that's curative.

630
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,313
It doesn't matter if you're exposing 
them to their past or the present or 

631
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,010
things they're worried about in the 
future.

632
00:32:03,011 --> 00:32:05,200
As long as they decide to do it 
voluntarily,

633
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,030
they get stronger and better.

634
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:07,931
So you think,
well,

635
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:09,700
what's the limit to that?
Well,

636
00:32:09,701 --> 00:32:10,534
the limit is to accept the limitations 
and catastrophes of your own mortality 

637
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:15,634
voluntarily.
And that's the potentially the proper 

638
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:19,114
pathway through life,
or at least it's the least bad pathway 

639
00:32:22,091 --> 00:32:23,920
through life,
which is something,

640
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,783
you know,
and then I think the same can be said 

641
00:32:26,351 --> 00:32:29,920
fairly decisively for the willingness to
grapple with,

642
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,720
with malevolence,
uh,

643
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:35,180
on a personal and individual level,
you know?

644
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,310
So anyways,
I started to lecture about that and,

645
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,790
and,
and to lay out those ideas more and more

646
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:42,950
clearly over the years as I've been 
lecturing.

647
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:47,690
And that's what I did for TV Ontario.
And I think that that's why the lectures

648
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:49,880
became popular because,
you know,

649
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:50,714
I'd put some words to ideas that people 
already knew and could revitalize a 

650
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:57,590
symbolic vocabulary that people had 
become divorced from and,

651
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:01,820
and that there was a hole in the culture
exactly where those ideas needed to be.

652
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,000
And so people found that they were,
well,

653
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:06,740
people tell me when they come and talk 
to me,

654
00:33:06,741 --> 00:33:07,574
they said,
well,

655
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,170
when you're talking,
it's like,

656
00:33:09,171 --> 00:33:12,110
I already know what you're saying,
but I don't have the words for it.

657
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,191
It's like,
well,

658
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:17,600
that's exactly what archetipal story is.
Like is that you all know the story.

659
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:18,493
You just don't know,
you know it or you know at a level that 

660
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:21,584
you can't articulate,
but you still recognize it when you see 

661
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,110
it and you still act it out and you see 
it in other people.

662
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,550
But it's really,
really,

663
00:33:28,551 --> 00:33:32,840
really good to have the words.
And that's partly why you should be very

664
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:33,674
careful about what you say and 
particularly careful about what you 

665
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:41,381
right now anyhow,
after the big ideas thing won't act,

666
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,813
came into my classes and tape maps of 
meaning and made 1330 minutes or TV 

667
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:49,040
shows out of them.

668
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,873
And that was pretty interesting.
And they were broadcast and kind of 

669
00:33:52,701 --> 00:33:56,120
evanescent because at that point they 
weren't put on the web.

670
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:58,250
So they're broadcast,
they pretty much disappear.

671
00:33:58,251 --> 00:33:59,510
Right.
And um,

672
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,330
so,
so,

673
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,320
so,
so fine.

674
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:06,110
So,
and I got some degree of,

675
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,890
what would you say I got?
I was exposed,

676
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,290
my ideas were exposed to a large number 
of people,

677
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,630
tens of thousands of people as a 
consequence of that.

678
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,003
And that seemed to go pretty well.
And so then youtube came along and I 

679
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:21,860
thought,
well,

680
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:23,690
I don't know what this is,
this youtube thing,

681
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,230
you know,
the comments section makes you like,

682
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:31,100
what would you say wary about being 
human?

683
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:34,880
I would say generally speaking,
and you know there was a lot of,

684
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,453
well there were a lot of things that it 
would be easy to be contemptuous of on 

685
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:43,100
Youtube,
like the canonical cute cat videos.

686
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:48,080
But I'm actually not so contempt chew us
of that or the interesting animal videos

687
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:48,914
because I think they actually speak to a
part of people that's actually quite 

688
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:53,210
good.
We liked cats,

689
00:34:53,211 --> 00:34:55,400
we like dogs,
we think animals are kind of cool.

690
00:34:55,401 --> 00:34:57,590
And you know,
we take a break and look at,

691
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:01,040
look at something that's pleasant and 
cute and maybe that's not so bad.

692
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,340
It's not serious,
but it's certainly not malevolent.

693
00:35:04,341 --> 00:35:07,640
And that's something.
So I thought,

694
00:35:07,641 --> 00:35:08,474
okay,
well I'll find these old videos I did 

695
00:35:10,551 --> 00:35:15,110
for Tvo and I'll put them up on youtube 
and maybe I'll just take my classes.

696
00:35:15,111 --> 00:35:15,944
And so I set up a,
because I have this theory that if it's 

697
00:35:17,961 --> 00:35:19,820
worth doing,
it's worth doing badly,

698
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,980
which you know,
it's true,

699
00:35:21,981 --> 00:35:24,050
but it's also true that if it's worth 
doing,

700
00:35:24,051 --> 00:35:24,884
it's worth doing well and you just need 
to know when to apply those two 

701
00:35:27,381 --> 00:35:28,214
principles.

702
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,850
And if you're loath to do something and 
procrastinating,

703
00:35:31,851 --> 00:35:33,680
then sometimes it's better to do it 
badly.

704
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:34,514
And I thought,
well I can't get a whole production 

705
00:35:35,931 --> 00:35:38,700
studio up and running cause I just don't
have the time.

706
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:39,534
I'll get an IPAD and learn to use it and
get an level ear mic and just set the 

707
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:46,530
thing up or maybe have a student film 
it.

708
00:35:46,531 --> 00:35:51,531
And so I did that for a couple of years 
for my personality class in this maps of

709
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:52,584
meaning class,
which is the class where I outlined the 

710
00:35:54,011 --> 00:35:55,950
sorts of ideas that I just described to 
you.

711
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,863
And uh,
last April I noticed that I'd had a 

712
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,780
million views and about 15,000 
subscribers,

713
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:05,430
you know,
and I thought,

714
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,080
huh,
million views,

715
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,630
hey,
that's an actually a lot of views.

716
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:10,643
It's like if I,
I've never write a scientific paper 

717
00:36:12,481 --> 00:36:14,850
that's been read a million times,
no one has,

718
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,410
that just never happens,
right?

719
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,900
That's happened zero times.
If it,

720
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,360
if you have a paper that's cited,
you know,

721
00:36:21,361 --> 00:36:24,780
someone else refers to it and one of 
their scientific papers a hundred times,

722
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:28,500
it's like that's a home run and a 
thousand times is a miracle.

723
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,870
So,
and then if you write a book,

724
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:34,380
you know there's,
I think 1.2 million books published last

725
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,250
year,
something like that.

726
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:38,430
And I think 500 of them sold more than a
hundred thousand copies.

727
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,830
So that's a sea of books,
right?

728
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:41,664
It's,
it's an ocean of books and all of them 

729
00:36:43,651 --> 00:36:45,630
fail it really.
So,

730
00:36:45,631 --> 00:36:46,464
so many of them fail that you might as 
well never write a book because the 

731
00:36:48,691 --> 00:36:53,691
probability that it will fail is like 
99.99% and that would be very depressing

732
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:58,290
if it wasn't the case that that's the 
case for anything creative you ever do.

733
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:01,500
So it's just baseline probability.
But I thought,

734
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:02,334
well,
if I wrote a book and it sold a million 

735
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:03,841
copies,
man,

736
00:37:03,841 --> 00:37:05,370
I'd be out dancing in the street.

737
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:06,870
Uh,
probably not.

738
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:08,880
But you know,
you get the idea.

739
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,000
So what does it mean to have a million 
youtube views?

740
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,740
Well,
who the hell knows?

741
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,933
Right?
I mean,

742
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:15,923
we don't have metrics for that.
We don't know what sort of influence 

743
00:37:17,851 --> 00:37:19,950
that's having.
We don't know anything about that.

744
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,020
We don't know whether we should take it 
seriously or,

745
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,020
or if it's or who you're talking to or 
anything.

746
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,390
But I thought,
well still it's a million.

747
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:29,700
And that's a lot.
And I thought,

748
00:37:29,701 --> 00:37:30,534
well maybe this is,
this is more serious thing than I 

749
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,760
initially envisioned.
And then I really thought about it and I

750
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:38,604
thought,

751
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:39,700
okay,

752
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,870
oh,
I get it.

753
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,450
Here's a hypothesis.
You know,

754
00:37:43,451 --> 00:37:45,930
back in the medieval times and before,
if,

755
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,670
if you wanted to book someone had to 
copy it by hand.

756
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:52,000
And so there weren't many books and they
were very expensive.

757
00:37:52,001 --> 00:37:52,834
And so,
and then Gutenberg came along and 

758
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,950
invented the movable type press and it 
was like,

759
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:57,843
poof.
Books were inexpensive and everybody 

760
00:37:59,741 --> 00:38:00,574
could have them.
And not like was that was a major 

761
00:38:01,601 --> 00:38:02,470
revolution,
right?

762
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,280
It within 400 years,
almost everyone in the western world and

763
00:38:06,281 --> 00:38:07,114
then very rapidly,
almost everyone in the entire world was 

764
00:38:09,641 --> 00:38:12,250
literate.
He could read silently even,

765
00:38:12,251 --> 00:38:13,084
which was something that before that was
reserved for a very small number of 

766
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:18,550
people because most people read out loud
when they read it all.

767
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,270
So that was a massive revolution.
And then I thought,

768
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,900
wait a minute,
maybe youtube is a Gutenberg revolution

769
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,313
because it allows the spoken word to 
have the same reach and longevity as a 

770
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:34,930
book.
Okay.

771
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,153
For the first time in human history,
spontaneous speeches can reach an 

772
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:46,111
infinite audience for eye,
for an unspecified duration of time.

773
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,190
Well that's a whole new thing.
That's a,

774
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:49,024
that's an entirely new thing.
And maybe it's easier for people to 

775
00:38:51,911 --> 00:38:54,910
listen than it is for them to read.
You know?

776
00:38:54,911 --> 00:38:55,744
I mean,
I'd rather read than listen cause I can 

777
00:38:56,741 --> 00:38:57,574
read way faster than I can listen.
But people will listen to a youtube 

778
00:39:00,491 --> 00:39:03,100
video at twice the normal speed,
sometimes more.

779
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,600
So you can circumvent that.
And then also with a youtube video,

780
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,000
if you convert it into a podcast,
let's say,

781
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:10,834
which I'll get to to a moment,
you all of a sudden have way more time 

782
00:39:13,781 --> 00:39:14,614
than you used to have because you can 
listen to a podcast while you're doing 

783
00:39:18,281 --> 00:39:19,150
other things.

784
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,103
So you can do mundane,
the mundane things that you have to do 

785
00:39:21,971 --> 00:39:24,310
from day to day,
like commute and so on.

786
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,360
But you can listen to a podcast.
And I've found that my students,

787
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:33,100
my young students are now listening to 
podcasts instead of music.

788
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,200
And that's really something,
you know,

789
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:36,034
because music of course,
it's been an unbelievably dynamic 

790
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:39,004
cultural force for maybe the,
the primary artistic cultural force for 

791
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:48,160
what maybe maybe since the 1950s 
anyways.

792
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:51,700
And that's being supplanted to some 
degree by podcasts.

793
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,833
And that's really something.
And then it also turns out that people 

794
00:39:54,371 --> 00:39:55,204
have an appetite for long,
detailed podcasts that are deep and 

795
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,330
informative,
was like,

796
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:03,610
who the hell would've guessed that?
Like no one,

797
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,460
it's it.
It just sort of came out of nowhere.

798
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:07,931
And so I thought,
well,

799
00:40:07,931 --> 00:40:08,764
maybe this is worth taking seriously.
And then like at the same time I was 

800
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:15,154
interested in,
I've always been interested in 

801
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:18,160
entrepreneur types and creative types.

802
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,023
They're,
they're high in this big five 

803
00:40:19,901 --> 00:40:20,734
personality trait called openness.
And there the people from whom all 

804
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:24,784
innovation flows,
but it's very hard for creative people 

805
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:27,994
to monetize their create creation 
because to monetize something you have 

806
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:34,930
to have the idea and then you have to 
translate it into a product and then you

807
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:37,390
have to bring it to market and then you 
have to sell it.

808
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:41,140
And then you have to develop customer 
relationships and customer support.

809
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:43,090
And it's like,
by the time you do all that,

810
00:40:43,091 --> 00:40:45,040
if you're going creative person,
you're either,

811
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:49,120
you've either been bought out and 
shunted to the side or you're dead,

812
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:51,420
so you don't get to have the money.
You,

813
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:54,110
you produce the value,
but you can't monetize it.

814
00:40:54,111 --> 00:40:55,740
And it's a big problem.
Uh,

815
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,930
it's why it's so frustrating to be a 
creative person often,

816
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:00,243
you know?
Um,

817
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,773
so I was looking around for ways that 
creative people could monetize their 

818
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:05,014
production online,
mostly because I'm like far too curious 

819
00:41:09,101 --> 00:41:10,810
for my own good.
And,

820
00:41:10,811 --> 00:41:13,990
uh,
my wife went off to visit her,

821
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,220
her,
uh,

822
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:15,961
her,
her,

823
00:41:15,961 --> 00:41:19,300
her father for about a week can I had a 
bunch of time,

824
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,303
uh,
I could stay up until three in the 

825
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:23,440
morning,
which I shouldn't do and work.

826
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,490
And I found a site called Patriot and 
Patriot allowed,

827
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:28,324
you know how patrion works.
It allows people to make voluntary 

828
00:41:29,951 --> 00:41:34,220
donations to support creative people who
are basically usually

829
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,380
making their work available for free,
which is,

830
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,940
I thought,
well that's pretty interesting.

831
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:42,020
It's appealing to the basic human desire
for reciprocity.

832
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,750
Like people actually don't like getting 
something for nothing.

833
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,300
It kind of puts them in existential 
debt.

834
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,373
And so they,
people generally feel that if they've 

835
00:41:49,491 --> 00:41:50,324
received something of value that they 
would like to give something of value 

836
00:41:52,491 --> 00:41:53,241
back.
Now,

837
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:54,860
not everyone,
but most people,

838
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,390
most people.
And I thought,

839
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:57,580
well,
what the hell?

840
00:41:57,581 --> 00:42:00,350
I'll set up the Patriot account and see 
what happens.

841
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:04,100
So it took me about like six hours or 
something like that to figure out how to

842
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:04,950
do it.
Exactly.

843
00:42:04,951 --> 00:42:09,951
And how to make a little what a banner 
on the youtube videos that was linked to

844
00:42:10,221 --> 00:42:11,054
the Patriot account.
There was all sorts of little weird 

845
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:14,090
tricks that you had to learn behind the 
scenes.

846
00:42:14,091 --> 00:42:15,260
And I thought,
well,

847
00:42:15,261 --> 00:42:16,580
whatever,
we'll see what happens.

848
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:20,990
And then at the end of that month,
I had about 50,

849
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:24,500
60 subscribers and about $500 us a 
month.

850
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:25,340
And I thought,
Huh,

851
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,070
that's pretty interesting.
You know,

852
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,860
I don't know what to make of it,
but I could take that money and increase

853
00:42:30,861 --> 00:42:32,270
the production quality.
Um,

854
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:33,363
if that keeps happening and,
and I'll just run this and keep seeing 

855
00:42:36,171 --> 00:42:37,850
how it works.
So,

856
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,980
okay.
So that was pretty interesting.

857
00:42:39,981 --> 00:42:43,760
And so I had thought through what it 
meant,

858
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,653
what youtube meant,
that it was a Gutenberg revolution and 

859
00:42:46,451 --> 00:42:47,284
that deserve to be taken seriously.
And then I found this platform for 

860
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:51,643
monetization for creative people.
Then the two things were married and 

861
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,573
that was April last year.
And then at the same time I was writing 

862
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:01,610
a book,
which is called 12 rules for life.

863
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:05,360
And some of you may have a,
or there's some flyers that are going to

864
00:43:05,361 --> 00:43:07,370
be distributed that tell you about the 
book.

865
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:08,203
But in any case,
I was reading this chapter in the book 

866
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:12,290
called don't bother children when 
they're skateboarding.

867
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:17,540
And it took me deep into the 
polarization of society because I wasn't

868
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:18,374
very happy about the fact that children 
are overprotected and that adventurous 

869
00:43:21,621 --> 00:43:22,454
children like skateboarders for example,
are often shut down when they're 

870
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:28,730
manifesting their bravery and their 
stupidity often.

871
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:31,700
But that's not always distinguishable 
from bravery.

872
00:43:31,701 --> 00:43:32,534
Right?
Cause you you,

873
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,350
that's like the trickster figure that 
Jonathan was talking about earlier.

874
00:43:36,351 --> 00:43:37,090
You know,
and he,

875
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:37,923
it's not always that easy to segregate 
the people who take unrealistic or 

876
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,073
unreasonable risks from those who are 
courageously extending their competence 

877
00:43:45,471 --> 00:43:47,930
into the unknown.
And so anyways,

878
00:43:47,931 --> 00:43:51,470
for reasons I won't tell you about that 
took me deep into the,

879
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,620
into the political polarization 
landscape with,

880
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:55,290
with,
uh,

881
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:56,123
you know,
with the increasing tension between the 

882
00:43:57,261 --> 00:43:58,094
left,
which I think is becoming increasingly 

883
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:00,950
totalitarian and the right.

884
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:02,030
And,
um,

885
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:05,660
and also with what seems to be something
like an assault on,

886
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,330
well,
Jonathan called it the logos,

887
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:12,440
which I think is exactly right,
which I think is a reflection of niches,

888
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:15,020
death of God,
and an assault on masculinity,

889
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:19,140
which is often now seen as toxic or part
of the oppressive patriarchy,

890
00:44:19,141 --> 00:44:21,200
really part patriarchy,
et Cetera,

891
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:22,034
et cetera.
And so this was kind of making my blood 

892
00:44:23,991 --> 00:44:27,230
boil while I was,
while I was writing this,

893
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,093
you know,
because you get tangled up in that and 

894
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:32,430
it,
it's kind of emotionally distressing.

895
00:44:32,431 --> 00:44:35,100
And I saw the spread of these sorts of

896
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,653
radical leftist ideas through campus and
I thought we'd killed all that off back 

897
00:44:42,501 --> 00:44:43,820
in the 1990s.
You know,

898
00:44:43,821 --> 00:44:47,180
there was a spike of political 
correctness and about 92.

899
00:44:47,181 --> 00:44:48,014
And I was in Boston at that point and it
kind of got pushed back and it 

900
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,400
disappeared.
And I thought,

901
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:53,211
well,
that's good,

902
00:44:53,211 --> 00:44:54,044
that's gone.
And then the economy boomed like mad in 

903
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:58,970
the u s and people had other things to 
concern themselves with.

904
00:44:58,971 --> 00:45:00,530
And then all of a sudden,
you know,

905
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,270
three years ago or so,
it was like,

906
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,690
wow,
this is back with a vengeance.

907
00:45:05,691 --> 00:45:10,250
It's like we ain't seen nothing yet.
And so that was bothering me.

908
00:45:10,251 --> 00:45:11,084
And then in my clinical practice I had a
couple of clients who had been bullied 

909
00:45:13,671 --> 00:45:14,504
into poor states of mental health by 
social justice warrior types at three 

910
00:45:18,111 --> 00:45:20,750
different workplaces.
And they were quite different people.

911
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,580
You know,
some of the more left leaning,

912
00:45:22,581 --> 00:45:25,390
some of the more right leaning,
but all had the same stories.

913
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,293
They were sensible people and now they 
were required to do things at their 

914
00:45:29,661 --> 00:45:31,970
workplace that they just couldn't 
tolerate doing.

915
00:45:31,971 --> 00:45:34,250
You know,
like sensitivity training or unconscious

916
00:45:34,251 --> 00:45:36,990
bias training.
Or here's one story.

917
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:37,843
God,
this woman is this woman that I was 

918
00:45:40,251 --> 00:45:43,250
working with.
This is the stupidest story.

919
00:45:43,251 --> 00:45:44,084
I wouldn't even believe it except she 
showed me all the emails she worked at 

920
00:45:46,971 --> 00:45:50,300
this large bureaucracy.
We'll leave it at that.

921
00:45:50,301 --> 00:45:54,200
And the,
the people at the bureaucracy would make

922
00:45:54,201 --> 00:45:55,760
presentations with those,
you know,

923
00:45:55,761 --> 00:45:58,790
those boards that you can set up that 
have big pads of paper on them?

924
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,133
Well,
those pads of paper that you can flip 

925
00:46:01,581 --> 00:46:03,920
are called flip charts.
Okay.

926
00:46:03,921 --> 00:46:04,754
And so,
but somebody got it into their head and 

927
00:46:06,831 --> 00:46:09,500
this was the manager of this,
of this particular client.

928
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:14,770
That flip was a racist term because 
apparently you can call Filipinos flip.

929
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,420
I didn't know that.

930
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,253
And,
and so flip chart is actually insulting 

931
00:46:20,301 --> 00:46:22,520
to Filipinos.
And so,

932
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,773
and so then she showed me this string of
like 30 emails that had gone back and 

933
00:46:27,231 --> 00:46:31,040
forth within her company from the 
management and a bunch of people,

934
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:32,000
you know,
that jen,

935
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,940
the typical suspects who are all 
concerned about this.

936
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,670
And they ended up banning the word flip 
chart.

937
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,890
And you know,
she was coming to talk to me saying,

938
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:43,160
look,
this is actually driving me crazy.

939
00:46:43,161 --> 00:46:43,994
I can't believe this is that people are 
spending their time doing this and that 

940
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:51,860
we're required to assent to it as if it 
isn't insane,

941
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:54,650
which of course it is.
And so,

942
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,110
um,
then then

943
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,193
I got wind of bill see 16 and I'd been 
looking into the Ontario human rights 

944
00:47:05,301 --> 00:47:10,301
commission already at that point.
And I wasn't very happy with the Ontario

945
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,533
Human Rights Commission.
I think there it's fascist organization 

946
00:47:13,491 --> 00:47:15,860
masquerading under the guise of 
compassion,

947
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,053
which is very,
very typical in and and very 

948
00:47:18,861 --> 00:47:19,694
intelligent.
Like if you're going to be a power 

949
00:47:21,081 --> 00:47:24,500
hungry or authoritarian,
who wants sensorial control,

950
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:25,483
the best way to allow yourself to be 
able to look at yourself in the mirror 

951
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,660
without screaming is to wear a mask of 
compassion,

952
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:33,350
which is exactly what I think's 
happening.

953
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:34,184
And Bill [inaudible] came out and it 
purported to add transgender rights to 

954
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:40,024
the list of protected rights in the 
Canadian human rights code and in the 

955
00:47:42,941 --> 00:47:43,774
criminal code.
And like it was one of those Trojan 

956
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:48,730
horses that Bret Weinstein just talked 
about.

957
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:51,520
You read the legislation,
it's only two paragraphs long.

958
00:47:51,521 --> 00:47:52,301
You Think,
Oh yeah,

959
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:53,134
Canadians are being nice to people who 
you know are in a strange category and 

960
00:47:56,351 --> 00:47:57,130
get oppressed.

961
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:58,870
That's,
that's the surface of it.

962
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:03,250
But then I went back and I read all the,
because they said on the federal website

963
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:04,084
that it would be interpreted in 
accordance with the policies developed 

964
00:48:06,431 --> 00:48:07,264
by the Ontario Human Rights Commission.
So I went read those policies and I 

965
00:48:09,851 --> 00:48:11,200
thought,
man,

966
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:13,780
first of all,
they were completely incoherent.

967
00:48:13,781 --> 00:48:15,520
They were extraordinarily poorly 
written.

968
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:16,354
They were philosophically appalling and 
they couldn't have been designed to get 

969
00:48:20,111 --> 00:48:23,230
more people in trouble if that would 
have been the purpose of the design.

970
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,270
So for example,
if you're a business owner,

971
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:27,370
they're not,
they're not pro capitalists,

972
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,380
let's put it that way.
If you're a business owner,

973
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:32,200
you are as responsible for the 
utterances of their,

974
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,950
of your employees as if you were 
uttering them yourself.

975
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,650
If the employee's utterance caused 
offense,

976
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,640
whether or not they meant the offense 
and whether or not there was any offense

977
00:48:42,641 --> 00:48:45,430
taken on the part of the person that was
being offended.

978
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,290
It was like,
my God.

979
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:49,000
Really?
That's really the,

980
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:51,810
that's really the rule.
And that was like one of,

981
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:52,863
and there was another rule in there,
which was that the Ontario human rights 

982
00:48:55,091 --> 00:48:58,030
commission could suspend 
jurisprudential,

983
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,210
um,
tradition in pursuit of their goals.

984
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,250
It was like clause 13 eight.
We know,

985
00:49:03,251 --> 00:49:04,160
just 13,
eight.

986
00:49:04,161 --> 00:49:07,600
It's just a little clause.
We can ignore all legal precedent.

987
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:10,390
So I was reading this and I thought,
what the hell,

988
00:49:10,391 --> 00:49:13,780
this is absolutely insane.
And then at the same time,

989
00:49:13,781 --> 00:49:17,650
the university hr department and Equity 
Reit equity,

990
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:18,300
that's,
that's,

991
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,230
that's,
you hear that word,

992
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:24,880
you're someone utters that word and you 
know they're ideologically possessed.

993
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:26,980
So you move away from them,
right?

994
00:49:26,981 --> 00:49:29,950
You move away from them because equity 
is a terrible,

995
00:49:29,951 --> 00:49:32,500
it's a terrible word.
It's one of those words that masquerades

996
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:35,830
as compassionate is a dreadful,
terrible word.

997
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:41,460
So anyways,
the HR and equity department had decided

998
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:42,310
that,
you know,

999
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:43,143
the university was rife with systemic 
racism and that was all implicit in our 

1000
00:49:46,871 --> 00:49:49,840
unconscious biases and that all the h 
and l,

1001
00:49:49,841 --> 00:49:53,260
all the staff,
hr staff would have to undergo mandatory

1002
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,480
unconscious bias retraining.

1003
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,490
Well then I thought,
okay,

1004
00:49:57,491 --> 00:49:58,690
okay.
Right.

1005
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:00,340
Come on.
Really,

1006
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,413
first of all,
you're using the implicit association 

1007
00:50:03,011 --> 00:50:04,120
test,
right?

1008
00:50:04,121 --> 00:50:06,010
And actually I could tell you a little 
bit about that test,

1009
00:50:06,011 --> 00:50:11,011
but only tell you a little bit
to use a test to diagnose it individual,

1010
00:50:11,471 --> 00:50:14,800
the test has to pass certain standards 
of reliability,

1011
00:50:14,801 --> 00:50:17,830
which means it measures the same thing 
within the same individual.

1012
00:50:17,831 --> 00:50:18,664
The same way across time because it's 
like otherwise you have a ruler that's 

1013
00:50:21,731 --> 00:50:23,950
made out of rubber.
It's not helpful,

1014
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:24,843
right?
It has to produce the same results with 

1015
00:50:26,471 --> 00:50:27,304
repeated administrations and it has to 
predict behavior in a way that's 

1016
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:34,220
consistent and with some degree of 
power.

1017
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:37,580
Okay,
well the IAT is not reliable,

1018
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,570
not nearly reliable enough to be used as
a diagnostic instrument,

1019
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:46,670
and it's not particularly valid.
It predicts a little bit of behavior,

1020
00:50:46,671 --> 00:50:50,660
but not much like a fragment of behavior
may be enough to even have a significant

1021
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:52,400
effect from,
from time to time,

1022
00:50:52,401 --> 00:50:56,510
but it's a small fraction like so your 
unconscious biases,

1023
00:50:56,511 --> 00:51:00,650
which are actually indistinguishable 
from your perceptions or maybe even your

1024
00:51:00,651 --> 00:51:04,370
ingroup favoritism and people are 
characterized by in group favoritism,

1025
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:05,204
which is why we like our families and 
it's not easily distinguishable from 

1026
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:11,240
your,
from your reaction to novelty as well,

1027
00:51:11,241 --> 00:51:12,074
because you're,
your implicit racial prejudice under 

1028
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:14,804
some conditions is indistinguishable 
from your preference for familiarity 

1029
00:51:17,811 --> 00:51:18,680
over novelty.

1030
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,753
So like the psych,
the psychological community is by no 

1031
00:51:22,731 --> 00:51:27,170
means united on what the implicit 
association test means by no means.

1032
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,213
And it has plenty of severe critics and 
even the people who have produced it 

1033
00:51:32,751 --> 00:51:35,240
admit that it shouldn't be used for 
diagnostic purposes.

1034
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:36,171
Wink,
wink,

1035
00:51:36,171 --> 00:51:37,850
wink.
So,

1036
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:41,450
and then there is no evidence whatsoever
that unconscious bias retraining,

1037
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,970
especially if it's mandatory eat first 
of all,

1038
00:51:43,971 --> 00:51:44,804
reduces unconscious bias,
which you can't measure very well 

1039
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:50,570
anyways or has any positive effect on 
explicit behavior.

1040
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,860
And so I thought the,
the attempt by the HR department to make

1041
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:55,694
that mandatory,
it was an unwarranted intrusion on the 

1042
00:51:58,101 --> 00:52:01,670
civil rights of the employees using 
pseudoscience as a mask.

1043
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:02,983
And so I was thinking about these things
at like two in the morning and I 

1044
00:52:05,511 --> 00:52:06,410
thought,
well,

1045
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:11,150
I can't sleep and I learned when I can't
sleep to go right.

1046
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:12,420
And this time I thought,
no,

1047
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:13,254
I'm not going to write this down.
I'm going to make youtube videos 

1048
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,280
instead.
We'll see what happens.

1049
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,313
Yeah.
So I sat in front of my computer and I 

1050
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:29,810
made these like low quality videos and 
the content was pretty good.

1051
00:52:29,811 --> 00:52:31,910
I laid out why I was irritated about 
bill,

1052
00:52:31,911 --> 00:52:35,420
see 16 and talked about the background,
you know,

1053
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:40,190
context of the legislation.
And then I made another one come telling

1054
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:41,024
the HR department at the university that
what they were doing was completely 

1055
00:52:43,491 --> 00:52:44,324
unwarranted and that they had no 
business doing it whatsoever and that 

1056
00:52:46,671 --> 00:52:47,504
they should stop.
And so then I released the videos and I 

1057
00:52:51,321 --> 00:52:55,040
thought then I went to sleep.
And you know,

1058
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:58,700
the reason I made the videos was because
I wanted to think these things through,

1059
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:00,380
right?
So,

1060
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:04,130
so like I'm doing onstage right now,
I'm thinking things through,

1061
00:53:04,131 --> 00:53:04,964
it's like something was bothering me.
And so I was trying to lay out the 

1062
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:11,390
arguments and trying to figure out why 
it bothered me into put a logical,

1063
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:11,990
you know,
to,

1064
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:15,080
to arrange it in a logical manner and to
try to communicate it.

1065
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,640
And you do that partly because you 
think,

1066
00:53:16,641 --> 00:53:17,474
well,
this is bugging me and here's what I 

1067
00:53:18,591 --> 00:53:19,424
think it is,
is like,

1068
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,680
is it bugging you too?
And how about you?

1069
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:23,540
And,
and if it isn't bugging any of you,

1070
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:26,880
well then I'm probably crazy.
But if it's bugging all of you to,

1071
00:53:26,881 --> 00:53:27,691
and then,
you know,

1072
00:53:27,691 --> 00:53:30,570
maybe there's something here.
And so that's why you have to be able to

1073
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:32,400
speak freely,
right?

1074
00:53:32,401 --> 00:53:33,234
Because you have to be able to bumble 
around with your thought and formulate 

1075
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:36,624
things and then see how other people 
respond to it and they'll criticize you 

1076
00:53:39,511 --> 00:53:42,270
or maybe agree with you and you get to 
modify what you're thinking.

1077
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,104
And so,
and plus I was experimenting like I 

1078
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,820
often do.
I was experimenting with Youtube.

1079
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:48,271
It's like,
well,

1080
00:53:48,271 --> 00:53:50,190
let's see what happens.
Well,

1081
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,750
that was quite something

1082
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:54,863
so,

1083
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:00,183
well,
the first thing that happened was there 

1084
00:54:00,731 --> 00:54:04,930
was a big demonstration,
like an anti Peterson demonstration.

1085
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,273
So I've had my own demonstration and 
that was in front of the building I 

1086
00:54:09,821 --> 00:54:12,550
worked out.
And not too many people came,

1087
00:54:12,551 --> 00:54:13,384
but they were people.
The people who came were calling me the 

1088
00:54:15,641 --> 00:54:18,580
sorts of names that Eric was called,
or the Brett was called,

1089
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:19,683
you know,
he's a bigot and a transphobic and 

1090
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,030
racist.
Oh,

1091
00:54:22,031 --> 00:54:22,864
I was a racist because the HR department
at the university had taken advice from 

1092
00:54:26,951 --> 00:54:27,784
black lives matter in formulating these 
policies and black lives matter in new 

1093
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:32,374
Toronto was led or established by two 
women who I thought were reprehensible 

1094
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:39,580
and had nothing to do with their race.
Like,

1095
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,370
I don't care who you are,
you can be reprehensible.

1096
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:44,770
And they were reprehensible in my 
estimation.

1097
00:54:44,771 --> 00:54:46,930
And there was plenty of documented 
evidence for that.

1098
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:48,041
And so I said,
well,

1099
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:51,430
why the hell are we taking advice on our
hr policies from,

1100
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:53,530
from these people?
It's like,

1101
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,770
when did that become acceptable?
And so that,

1102
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:58,570
that's why I was a racist.
So,

1103
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:00,100
and,
and so,

1104
00:55:00,101 --> 00:55:00,934
you know,
all of these accusations were thrown at 

1105
00:55:02,771 --> 00:55:05,680
me and I thought about that a lot in the
last year.

1106
00:55:05,681 --> 00:55:07,210
It's like,
what was that reasonable?

1107
00:55:07,211 --> 00:55:08,044
And it's actually kind of reasonable in 
a weird way because Canada's a stable 

1108
00:55:12,941 --> 00:55:13,774
country and has been for a long time.
It's pretty peaceful and things work 

1109
00:55:16,211 --> 00:55:17,044
pretty well.
And so if you pop your head up and say 

1110
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,940
something stupid and reprehensible is 
going on,

1111
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,190
the Canadians say,
no,

1112
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,180
this is Canada.
You're crazy.

1113
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:28,210
And which is the right response.
Right.

1114
00:55:28,211 --> 00:55:29,044
And so then they throw a bunch of things
at you that might match the kind of 

1115
00:55:32,021 --> 00:55:36,400
crazy you are.
And if one of them sticks then well then

1116
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,360
they can ignore you.

1117
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:38,900
And you know,
I'm,

1118
00:55:38,901 --> 00:55:39,734
I'm obviously being a bit facetious and 
it's not like the people who are doing 

1119
00:55:42,251 --> 00:55:43,084
this to me didn't know exactly why they 
were doing it and it isn't like they 

1120
00:55:45,221 --> 00:55:49,330
were trying to bring me down and destroy
me because they certainly were.

1121
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:50,853
And then 200 faculty members and 
graduate students and the like from the 

1122
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:56,823
disciplines that you'd expect wrote a 
petition saying that I had made the 

1123
00:55:59,891 --> 00:56:03,280
university an unsafe place.
And uh,

1124
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:05,013
and then there was a counter 
demonstration that the students who 

1125
00:56:07,901 --> 00:56:08,734
decided to support free speech set up 
and they asked me to speak and lauren 

1126
00:56:11,891 --> 00:56:14,890
southern to speak and um,
a couple of other people and they had an

1127
00:56:14,891 --> 00:56:15,724
open mic session so that anyone could 
speak and it was out in front of the 

1128
00:56:19,061 --> 00:56:19,894
same building.
And there was quite a few people at 

1129
00:56:20,771 --> 00:56:22,720
that.
There was about 200 people.

1130
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,553
And,
and I went out there and that there was 

1131
00:56:25,521 --> 00:56:28,000
some bad guys there,
you know,

1132
00:56:28,001 --> 00:56:31,300
there were just your typical students 
who were confused and squawking away and

1133
00:56:31,301 --> 00:56:32,134
chanting,
but peppered among them were the types 

1134
00:56:34,781 --> 00:56:37,360
of people who were seriously looking for
trouble.

1135
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:39,490
And I can,
I'm a clinical psychologist,

1136
00:56:39,491 --> 00:56:42,340
I've worked with all sorts of people.
I can identify people like that.

1137
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,250
They're not very common,
thank God.

1138
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,210
But there were plenty of them at that 
rally and they,

1139
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:53,250
it could be any kind of rally where the 
possibility for trouble was emerging and

1140
00:56:53,591 --> 00:56:55,510
they would have been the type that was 
going to be there.

1141
00:56:55,511 --> 00:56:59,950
So I was keeping my eye on them and they
were blasting white noise and there were

1142
00:56:59,951 --> 00:57:03,660
unplugging our PA systems and,
and stealing the mic and,

1143
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:04,583
and you know,
just behaving in a manner that should 

1144
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:10,540
have been shut down by the university 
authorities but wasn't,

1145
00:57:10,541 --> 00:57:11,374
but the university authorities were 
taken off guard by all of this and they 

1146
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:14,164
didn't really know what to do and they 
weren't really aware of the underlying 

1147
00:57:16,961 --> 00:57:19,960
legal transformations that were going on
in our society.

1148
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,960
And anyways,
they unplugged the mic.

1149
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:23,794
And so then I talked very loudly about 
the necessity for free speech and that 

1150
00:57:29,411 --> 00:57:30,244
was recorded and went online.
And then I left and I came back about 

1151
00:57:34,931 --> 00:57:38,070
two hours later to talk to the cops and 
uh,

1152
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:39,093
to see if anything I didn't,
I was hoping that nothing of any 

1153
00:57:42,161 --> 00:57:44,470
significance,
no one was hurt.

1154
00:57:44,471 --> 00:57:45,304
So I wanted to go talk to the cops and 
see if it all went okay and I went and 

1155
00:57:48,701 --> 00:57:50,200
talked to them.
And then when I came back,

1156
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:51,034
this group of trans activists protestors
who claim to be speaking for the Trans 

1157
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,520
Community,
which doesn't exist,

1158
00:58:00,521 --> 00:58:03,700
there is no trans community.
They're not a homogenous group.

1159
00:58:03,701 --> 00:58:06,400
They don't all think the same way.
And besides,

1160
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:07,234
you don't become the spokesman for a 
person by claiming that you're the 

1161
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:11,194
spokesman just because you happen to 
share some of the attributes of that 

1162
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:14,500
group.

1163
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:15,333
But we're so guilty about the treatment 
of minorities that were willing to 

1164
00:58:18,731 --> 00:58:23,230
regard anyone who plays that particular 
card as worthy of listening to.

1165
00:58:23,231 --> 00:58:25,270
And that's a big mistake because you 
know,

1166
00:58:25,271 --> 00:58:27,760
there,
there's valid representation and invalid

1167
00:58:27,761 --> 00:58:29,110
representation.
Anyways,

1168
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:31,930
they surrounded me and videotape the 
exchange.

1169
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:32,764
And it was one particularly noisy person
there who was quite dismissive and 

1170
00:58:36,371 --> 00:58:39,010
insulting.
And I tried to have a conversation.

1171
00:58:39,011 --> 00:58:39,870
And,
um,

1172
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:43,360
the first thing this person said was 
that Peterson,

1173
00:58:43,361 --> 00:58:46,150
what do you think about the Nazis that 
were at your rally?

1174
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:49,840
And I thought,
you know,

1175
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:53,170
you'd have to really look hard in Canada
to find a Nazi.

1176
00:58:53,171 --> 00:58:55,360
They're just,
there just aren't that many of them,

1177
00:58:55,361 --> 00:58:56,860
you know,
so,

1178
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:57,813
so I,
I thought it was preposterous to begin 

1179
00:58:59,891 --> 00:59:00,724
with.
And,

1180
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,200
um,
I said,

1181
00:59:02,201 --> 00:59:02,900
well,
I don't,

1182
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,330
you know,
what do you want me to say?

1183
00:59:04,331 --> 00:59:05,950
It's like,
welcome Nazis.

1184
00:59:05,951 --> 00:59:07,540
It's no,
it's like I said,

1185
00:59:07,541 --> 00:59:09,250
I don't like Nazis,
you know,

1186
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:10,660
and,
and she said,

1187
00:59:10,661 --> 00:59:11,740
well,
what about,

1188
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,940
you know,
the fact that they were here?

1189
00:59:13,941 --> 00:59:15,400
And I said,
well,

1190
00:59:15,401 --> 00:59:20,110
I can't control who happens to appear 
somewhere.

1191
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,340
And it was all,

1192
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,660
it was all false.
None of that was true at all.

1193
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:27,750
It wasn't even a little bit true,
but you know,

1194
00:59:27,751 --> 00:59:30,330
it's an easy weapon to,
to haul out.

1195
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,800
And so they sh she,
he,

1196
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,790
no,
I'm not being smart about that.

1197
00:59:38,791 --> 00:59:42,090
It was like this was a trans person and 
I don't know exactly,

1198
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:43,163
I couldn't figure out how to refer to,
we'll say her and I got health without 

1199
00:59:47,701 --> 00:59:48,534
too.
And I tried to have a conversation and 

1200
00:59:51,661 --> 00:59:56,070
it was just,
she was just blaring nonstop ideological

1201
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:57,810
like nonsense at me,
you know?

1202
00:59:57,990 --> 00:59:58,823
And just,
it just hurt cause I like to talk to 

1203
01:00:01,261 --> 01:00:01,801
people,
you know?

1204
01:00:01,801 --> 01:00:05,280
But I really do not like having 
ideological slogans glared at me.

1205
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,110
I didn't really,
I find it,

1206
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:11,590
I find it,
I don't know exactly how,

1207
01:00:11,591 --> 01:00:12,670
what,
how I find it,

1208
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:15,950
but
it's like,

1209
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:18,770
it's like,
it's like really loud white noise.

1210
01:00:18,771 --> 01:00:20,550
It's something like that.
Or maybe it's worse than that.

1211
01:00:20,551 --> 01:00:22,340
It's like static.
It's like really loud,

1212
01:00:22,341 --> 01:00:23,850
static.
It's jagged.

1213
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,630
And I said,
look,

1214
01:00:26,631 --> 01:00:28,340
you know,
like quit that.

1215
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:30,500
It's like I can't,
I'd like to talk to you,

1216
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:34,760
but I can't tolerate that.
You know what slogan means?

1217
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:38,450
Slogan is derived from Tube,
Welsh,

1218
01:00:38,451 --> 01:00:43,430
word slew ag and Gerome and it means 
battle cry of the dead.

1219
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:48,160
So that's really,
we're thinking about man.

1220
01:00:48,161 --> 01:00:51,280
The next time you want to like have a 
slogan on your tee shirts,

1221
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:52,114
just remember who you're standing for.
It's like you're the skeletal army of 

1222
01:00:54,821 --> 01:00:58,570
zombies come to life and,
and they are possessing you,

1223
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,190
right?
It's their words,

1224
01:01:00,191 --> 01:01:01,024
your mouth thing.
It's nothing alive and it's not 

1225
01:01:03,371 --> 01:01:05,860
something that likes life.
It's a horror show.

1226
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:09,070
That's what a slogan is.
Anyways,

1227
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:09,963
they videotaped all this and they're 
going to put it online to show what a 

1228
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:15,220
reprehensible creature I was.
So they did.

1229
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,113
And that didn't work out.
Things being viewed about three and a 

1230
01:01:19,031 --> 01:01:19,864
half million times now and the positive 
comments out number of the negative 

1231
01:01:23,801 --> 01:01:26,560
comments like 99 to one,
something like that.

1232
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:31,270
And so that was an interesting case of 
that inversion that Jonathan was talking

1233
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:31,691
about.
You know,

1234
01:01:31,691 --> 01:01:36,460
how everything's upside down.
And so they tried one tactic and it just

1235
01:01:36,461 --> 01:01:37,840
flipped on them completely.

1236
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,590
And so,
uh,

1237
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:40,660
but,
but here's,

1238
01:01:40,661 --> 01:01:41,494
here's something to think about.
Like if one person who was nominally 

1239
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:50,460
supporting me at that rally would have 
done anything stupid whatsoever that was

1240
01:01:51,101 --> 01:01:54,190
captured on videotape,
I have been sunk.

1241
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:57,280
Right?
And so we're in this situation where the

1242
01:01:57,281 --> 01:02:02,281
actions of specific individuals have a 
determining effect far beyond what we're

1243
01:02:02,891 --> 01:02:03,724
accustomed to.
You saw that in Charlottesville where 

1244
01:02:04,901 --> 01:02:05,734
that guy ran somebody over with a car 
and it was like political polarization 

1245
01:02:09,041 --> 01:02:12,400
in the u s increased instantly by 10% 
right.

1246
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:13,263
And that's part of the,
I said like social media isn't an echo 

1247
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:17,650
chamber,
it's an amplifier.

1248
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,340
And so,
well,

1249
01:02:20,341 --> 01:02:21,174
so I was very fortunate and then this 
person also said that she had watched 

1250
01:02:24,871 --> 01:02:25,704
all my youtube videos and I looked at 
her because that was ridiculous because 

1251
01:02:29,851 --> 01:02:32,050
there was like 200 of them online by 
that point.

1252
01:02:32,051 --> 01:02:32,884
And like
some people I presume have now watched 

1253
01:02:36,601 --> 01:02:40,200
all 200 of them,
but it's like 500 hours of content.

1254
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:45,200
So I knew that that was complete rubbish
and basically said as much.

1255
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:50,580
And anyways it went well for me and it 
didn't go so well for the protesters and

1256
01:02:50,581 --> 01:02:51,414
then the university.
And so that was my first encounter with 

1257
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,133
Youtube and its tendency to amplify and,
and also what the tight rope line is 

1258
01:03:02,341 --> 01:03:04,570
when these sorts of things happen,
you know,

1259
01:03:04,571 --> 01:03:07,110
and for a whole year it's not quite so 
bad now,

1260
01:03:07,111 --> 01:03:07,944
although it's just about as bad.
I lived in absolute terror of ever have 

1261
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:15,720
two things ever saying the wrong thing,
even if it was clipped out of context,

1262
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:16,933
right.
Or having something unearth that I said 

1263
01:03:19,381 --> 01:03:21,810
before,
that was the wrong thing,

1264
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,300
even if it was taken out of context.
Now luckily,

1265
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:28,290
and this was kind of unique,
I already had 260 videos,

1266
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:29,124
200 videos up.
And so when I was being accused of all 

1267
01:03:31,561 --> 01:03:33,660
of these things,
I could say,

1268
01:03:33,661 --> 01:03:34,494
well you know,
have add or there's 500 every single 

1269
01:03:37,321 --> 01:03:40,170
word I've said to students in the last 
20 years is being recorded.

1270
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:43,620
If you want to find some Nazi 
propaganda,

1271
01:03:43,621 --> 01:03:44,910
it's like,
have adder man.

1272
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:48,180
Good luck to you.
And of course it was not only false,

1273
01:03:48,181 --> 01:03:50,850
it was,
it was antithetical to the truth because

1274
01:03:50,851 --> 01:03:51,684
I've been teaching people about Nazi 
atrocities for 30 years and trying to 

1275
01:03:56,791 --> 01:04:01,791
help people understand how it was that 
it would be likely had they been in Nazi

1276
01:04:02,101 --> 01:04:02,934
Germany,
that they would've been on the side of 

1277
01:04:03,781 --> 01:04:05,760
the Nazis and not on the side of the 
Jews.

1278
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:06,613
You wouldn't have been the hero,
you would have been the perpetrator 

1279
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,473
statistically speaking,
and that you really need to understand 

1280
01:04:11,671 --> 01:04:13,620
that.
So I was fortunate,

1281
01:04:13,621 --> 01:04:16,320
I was protected by that backlog of 
information.

1282
01:04:16,321 --> 01:04:19,830
And so that was really good.
And then the university did it.

1283
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,930
Another thing that reversed,
you know,

1284
01:04:21,931 --> 01:04:24,360
they wrote me a letter saying,
you know,

1285
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:25,194
all these people are complaining,
you're making the campus and unsafe 

1286
01:04:28,171 --> 01:04:29,004
place,
you have to and your might be violating 

1287
01:04:31,711 --> 01:04:33,960
our code of conduct and the law.

1288
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,003
And I thought,
I didn't know what to make of that 

1289
01:04:36,151 --> 01:04:36,984
letter.
I told them to take the letter back 

1290
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,740
because I said,
look,

1291
01:04:40,741 --> 01:04:41,574
if you're going to go after me,
because I actually liked the University 

1292
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:44,730
of Toronto.
So if you're gonna go after me,

1293
01:04:44,731 --> 01:04:47,610
you should go after me correctly.
And this,

1294
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:52,670
this document is actually untrue in that
it contains sins of omission because you

1295
01:04:52,741 --> 01:04:53,574
may have got letters from the staff 
saying what a reprehensible person I 

1296
01:04:56,581 --> 01:04:57,414
was.
But you also got 15,000 signatures on a 

1297
01:05:00,331 --> 01:05:03,360
petition and hundreds of letters from 
people supporting me.

1298
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:05,250
And you didn't say anything about that 
in the letter.

1299
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:07,710
So how about we,
you know,

1300
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,633
you write a letter that says,
well some people aren't very happy with 

1301
01:05:10,891 --> 01:05:13,890
you and other people are,
but we've decided that what you're doing

1302
01:05:13,891 --> 01:05:16,050
is too risky and you know,
you should stop,

1303
01:05:16,051 --> 01:05:16,884
but they wouldn't take it.

1304
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:22,560
So I read it online and that's what was 
interesting too because now if something

1305
01:05:23,171 --> 01:05:25,840
happens to you,
it doesn't have to be secret.

1306
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:30,040
I didn't even comment on it except maybe
with raised eyebrows from time to time,

1307
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:33,550
I just read it and say,
you draw your own damn conclusions here.

1308
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:35,230
And so,
and I was actually,

1309
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:38,380
I wouldn't say secretly happy about it 
because I wasn't,

1310
01:05:38,381 --> 01:05:41,530
because my job was at risk and that 
wasn't all that was at risk.

1311
01:05:41,531 --> 01:05:42,364
But my job certainly was,
but I had said when I made the video 

1312
01:05:46,661 --> 01:05:51,661
criticizing bill c 16 that the act of 
making the video was probably illegal.

1313
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:54,130
And then the university came out and 
said,

1314
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:58,570
what you're doing is probably illegal.
And so my claims,

1315
01:05:58,571 --> 01:06:01,630
which the press,
the press was very divided about this.

1316
01:06:01,631 --> 01:06:03,700
And they thought,
well maybe I was being too radical in my

1317
01:06:03,701 --> 01:06:04,090
claims.

1318
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:05,500
But then the university came out and 
said,

1319
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:06,723
well,
you're probably violating the law and 

1320
01:06:07,601 --> 01:06:08,920
you should shut up.
And I said,

1321
01:06:08,921 --> 01:06:09,754
Ha,
I told you that that's how this law was 

1322
01:06:11,951 --> 01:06:13,840
constructed.
And so,

1323
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:17,290
and then they did it again.
But,

1324
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:21,040
and I know how HR departments works.
It's like one letters like shut the hell

1325
01:06:21,041 --> 01:06:21,874
up.
Second letter is we told you once 

1326
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:25,540
already to shut up.
Third Letter says,

1327
01:06:25,541 --> 01:06:28,900
we told you twice you didn't.
So like now you're in trouble.

1328
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,810
And then the fourth letter is see you 
later.

1329
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,680
And if you're a tenured faculty member 
and you break the law,

1330
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:39,100
that's sufficient to be be nodded,
tenured faculty members.

1331
01:06:39,101 --> 01:06:43,750
So they were gearing up to do this and
well then,

1332
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,410
well to say that,
well man,

1333
01:06:47,411 --> 01:06:48,244
that was really something.
Then what happened was there were 

1334
01:06:49,781 --> 01:06:54,781
reporters at our house for for like four
months lined up just all the time,

1335
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,180
literally eight hours a day.

1336
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,280
The reporters coming in,
reporters going out,

1337
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:01,383
there's about 250 newspaper articles 
published in Canada about this over 

1338
01:07:04,481 --> 01:07:05,314
about a two and a half month period.
And that didn't count the podcasts and 

1339
01:07:07,931 --> 01:07:10,720
the radio shows and the TV coverage.
And like it just,

1340
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:14,800
it went absolutely.
It was absolutely insane.

1341
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:19,090
I've never seen anything like it.
And See,

1342
01:07:19,091 --> 01:07:19,924
I was trying to figure out what was 
going on at that point because my sense 

1343
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:25,300
when I made the videos was this had 
nothing to do with transgender rights.

1344
01:07:25,301 --> 01:07:26,134
This is indicative of a deep war of 
ideas and this is just the latest 

1345
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:34,150
manifestation of that deep war of ideas.
So maybe it was a war at a philosophical

1346
01:07:34,151 --> 01:07:36,640
level or even a war at a theological 
level,

1347
01:07:36,641 --> 01:07:38,880
which I actually,
I actually think it's such a deep,

1348
01:07:38,881 --> 01:07:40,900
or that it is a ward,
a theological level.

1349
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:42,203
Um,
and that was sort of the level at which 

1350
01:07:43,481 --> 01:07:44,620
I was going after it.

1351
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:45,933
And I believe that subsequent events 
demonstrated that that was the case 

1352
01:07:50,201 --> 01:07:53,760
because what should have happened,
I always think of counterfactuals,

1353
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:56,230
you know,
if a client comes into my office and the

1354
01:07:56,231 --> 01:08:00,340
first time I see them and they're all 
upset because they couldn't find a place

1355
01:08:00,341 --> 01:08:03,160
to park in there late and they're all 
apologetic and I think,

1356
01:08:03,161 --> 01:08:03,994
okay,
well now I know something about you 

1357
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:06,370
because you could have come in here and 
said,

1358
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,280
why the hell didn't you tell me where 
the parking was?

1359
01:08:09,281 --> 01:08:10,150
I'm late.
Or,

1360
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:12,190
or you could've said thought to 
yourself,

1361
01:08:12,191 --> 01:08:13,340
well,
this is my time anyway,

1362
01:08:13,341 --> 01:08:14,174
so I don't have to apologize.
So you run these counterfactuals that 

1363
01:08:17,001 --> 01:08:19,700
helps you understand the world better.
And I thought,

1364
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,273
well,
what should have happened was that I 

1365
01:08:24,411 --> 01:08:27,710
made these videos two in the morning to 
15 minutes long.

1366
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:31,400
There's a little flurry of interest and 
then it's like onto the next thing.

1367
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,150
But that is not what happened.
That didn't happen even a little bit.

1368
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:36,043
What happened was so opposite from that,
that I still don't know what to make of 

1369
01:08:39,711 --> 01:08:41,240
it.
And of course this is part of it,

1370
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:43,930
the fact that I'm here talking to all of
you people and,

1371
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:47,363
and so,
and then what happened was that the 

1372
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:55,631
press flipped and came on my side.
So 200 Canadian newspapers,

1373
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:58,220
there's a consortium came out and said,
well,

1374
01:08:58,221 --> 01:08:59,054
we support Peterson.
And then a huge number of mainstream 

1375
01:09:01,461 --> 01:09:05,090
journalists like the powerful 
independent mainstream journalists,

1376
01:09:05,091 --> 01:09:06,710
Barbara K,
um,

1377
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,960
uh,
Antonella,

1378
01:09:09,030 --> 01:09:10,940
uh,
what's Nellis last name?

1379
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:13,400
Can you ever remember names?
So embarrassing.

1380
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,160
Margaret [inaudible],
Conrad Black,

1381
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:18,320
um,
at crazy new fee.

1382
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:20,810
He goes on CBC at night.
Uh,

1383
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:23,210
what's his name?
Rex Murphy.

1384
01:09:23,211 --> 01:09:24,380
Yeah.
They all came out on,

1385
01:09:24,381 --> 01:09:25,214
on my side because what they did,
they did the journalistic homework and 

1386
01:09:28,551 --> 01:09:32,120
they went and read the things I read and
they found out that if anything,

1387
01:09:32,121 --> 01:09:32,954
I was understating the catastrophe that 
was written into the Ontario Human 

1388
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:39,530
Rights Commission website.

1389
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:40,363
So for example,
one of the catastrophes was they wrote 

1390
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,333
in a social constructionist view of 
gender identity that's law in Canada 

1391
01:09:47,931 --> 01:09:49,270
now.
And like,

1392
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:51,770
it's hard to say exactly how significant
that is.

1393
01:09:52,070 --> 01:09:57,070
If you don't know.
What it means is maybe is that to have a

1394
01:09:57,891 --> 01:09:58,724
view that biology is the primary 
determinant of gender identity is now 

1395
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:05,000
illegal.
Now,

1396
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:06,680
I don't know that for sure.
And you can say,

1397
01:10:06,681 --> 01:10:07,880
well,
maybe that's alarmist,

1398
01:10:07,881 --> 01:10:12,020
but hey,
I know how ideas unfold across time.

1399
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,520
You know,
you have an idea,

1400
01:10:13,521 --> 01:10:16,730
you put it in the law,
the law is a living thing.

1401
01:10:16,731 --> 01:10:19,430
It's got lots of tentacles.
Nobody knows how it unfolds.

1402
01:10:19,431 --> 01:10:20,264
You throw something new in there,
you don't even know what it is you're 

1403
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:22,874
throwing in.
You throw a demand that a social 

1404
01:10:24,651 --> 01:10:28,370
constructionist view of gender identity 
is now legally true.

1405
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:28,821
It's,
well,

1406
01:10:28,821 --> 01:10:30,920
what do you do with all the evolutionary
biologists like,

1407
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,430
like Brett who say,
no,

1408
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:36,530
that's wrong.

1409
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:40,010
It's partly socially constructed,
like everything is among human beings.

1410
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:41,690
And so anyways,
the journalist went and wrote,

1411
01:10:41,691 --> 01:10:44,300
read that and um,
they thought,

1412
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:45,380
oh,
well this guy,

1413
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:47,263
first of all,
isn't any of those things that he's 

1414
01:10:48,561 --> 01:10:49,394
being accused of.
One of the funniest days of my life was 

1415
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,670
I went to this lecture,
um,

1416
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:58,580
where I was being accused of being a 
racist and a transphobic and a bigot and

1417
01:10:58,581 --> 01:11:02,180
all of these things in the same day,
literally the same day,

1418
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:03,163
there were 30 people in my house on the 
third floor and about 15 of the more 

1419
01:11:06,921 --> 01:11:07,754
from this native tribe Kwakwaka'Wakw,
they live on northern tip of northern 

1420
01:11:12,261 --> 01:11:14,310
Vancouver.
And I just stablish to relationship with

1421
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:15,144
a carver there named Charles Joseph,
who recently had a huge totem pole 

1422
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:20,010
erected in front of the Montreal Museum 
of Fine Art.

1423
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:22,320
I established a working relationship 
with him.

1424
01:11:22,321 --> 01:11:23,154
He was at a residential school survivor 
and I'd been buying a bunch of his art 

1425
01:11:26,281 --> 01:11:31,230
and I built a replica of modern replica 
of a Kwakwaka'Wakw big house on my third

1426
01:11:31,231 --> 01:11:34,080
floor with his help and filled it with 
totem poles and all these things.

1427
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:34,913
And he brought a bunch of his people to 
the Toronto and had induction ceremony 

1428
01:11:38,731 --> 01:11:41,940
and I was inducted into their tribe.
And that was the same day.

1429
01:11:41,941 --> 01:11:45,030
It was like,
what do you make of that?

1430
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:45,960
It's,
it's such,

1431
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:47,700
it's so surreal.
You know,

1432
01:11:47,701 --> 01:11:49,800
to go from one of those worlds to the 
other.

1433
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:53,880
And I had many surreal days like that.
Anyways,

1434
01:11:56,370 --> 01:11:58,260
then I had this debate at the 
university,

1435
01:11:58,261 --> 01:12:00,510
which the university graciously decided 
to host.

1436
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,344
And I talked a lot to the dean and we 
kind of came to some terms and they 

1437
01:12:04,411 --> 01:12:07,560
basically decided that they would leave 
me alone.

1438
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:11,820
And I had a terrible catastrophe of 
health in December.

1439
01:12:11,821 --> 01:12:14,040
I just,
it was absolutely unbearable.

1440
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:17,190
I don't exactly know what happened,
but I could barely get it.

1441
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:19,320
Get going to teach in January.
Yeah.

1442
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:22,050
It was very shaky for,
for like two months.

1443
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,380
But I,
but it,

1444
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:28,140
it went forward and the students were 
very welcoming and inviting,

1445
01:12:28,141 --> 01:12:29,040
so that was very good.

1446
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:33,030
But then all of this crazy background 
media,

1447
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:36,390
uh,
explosion didn't quit at all.

1448
01:12:36,391 --> 01:12:39,300
It just kept snowballing and snowballing
and snowballing and,

1449
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:41,280
you know,
and then I was talking to people,

1450
01:12:41,281 --> 01:12:43,980
Gad Saad was one of the early people who
interviewed me,

1451
01:12:43,981 --> 01:12:45,990
you know,
and I'm going to be speaking with him at

1452
01:12:45,991 --> 01:12:46,824
noon on November 11th in Toronto.
And I'm actually quite afraid of that 

1453
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:52,680
because I think the radicals who shut us
down at Ryerson,

1454
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:53,514
I know full well,
they're planning to come out in full 

1455
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:56,700
number.
And I really don't.

1456
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:57,863
I'm really concerned about that.
And if you know anybody who's going and 

1457
01:13:00,721 --> 01:13:04,260
who's purportedly supporters,
let's say of what we're doing,

1458
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:08,730
I really would like you to encourage 
them to like keep the,

1459
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,450
keep themselves in control.
It's like,

1460
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:14,153
I know there might be agent provocateurs
in the crowd because these people are 

1461
01:13:16,831 --> 01:13:18,030
certainly capable of that.

1462
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:21,420
But I don't want anything stupid to 
happen now.

1463
01:13:21,421 --> 01:13:22,254
We're not going to cancel it because,
because we're not canceling it and 

1464
01:13:24,871 --> 01:13:25,704
that's that.
But I don't want anything stupid to 

1465
01:13:28,111 --> 01:13:30,000
happen.
It would be better if it didn't.

1466
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:31,830
So,
um,

1467
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,300
anyways,
I talked to Gad,

1468
01:13:33,301 --> 01:13:34,134
Saad and then a whole bunch of other 
youtubers and then I got to be aware of 

1469
01:13:37,471 --> 01:13:40,710
this whole Youtube universe that,
you know,

1470
01:13:40,711 --> 01:13:41,470
that,
that,

1471
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:43,290
uh,
Jonathan was talking about.

1472
01:13:43,291 --> 01:13:44,124
And that's been an unbelievably bizarre 
experience because it is the case that 

1473
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:50,580
there's nothing really uniting us in 
some sense.

1474
01:13:50,581 --> 01:13:51,840
We're very different people.
Like,

1475
01:13:51,841 --> 01:13:54,210
I'm very different than,
than Joe Rogan,

1476
01:13:54,211 --> 01:13:55,044
for example.
And I was on this show called h three h 

1477
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:58,493
three the other day,
and he's this crazy Israeli clown 

1478
01:14:00,751 --> 01:14:01,740
comedian,
you know,

1479
01:14:01,741 --> 01:14:02,640
and,
and,

1480
01:14:02,641 --> 01:14:03,480
uh,
uh,

1481
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:07,050
Dave Rubin's and married gay guy and you
know,

1482
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:11,560
and while in Gad,
Saad is a Lebanese refugee,

1483
01:14:11,561 --> 01:14:13,480
basically it,
there's nothing about us.

1484
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:18,520
It's the same except something is 
uniting us and we all kind of know about

1485
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:20,410
each other down.
We're all communicating and,

1486
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:23,230
and I don't know what that means 
exactly.

1487
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,440
Um,
I don't know what that means.

1488
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:31,690
And then at the same time,
so that's all been extremely strange,

1489
01:14:31,691 --> 01:14:36,670
this multiplication of,
of voice that the Internet provides,

1490
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:38,020
you know,
for better or for worse.

1491
01:14:38,021 --> 01:14:39,430
And I think that is what it is.
It's a,

1492
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:40,293
it's a moral amplifier.
And I also think that these AI systems 

1493
01:14:44,411 --> 01:14:47,210
that we're building,
our moral amplifiers and,

1494
01:14:47,211 --> 01:14:48,044
and they're,
they're going to be moral amplifiers to 

1495
01:14:49,961 --> 01:14:50,794
a degree that we can't even imagine even
knowing how much facebook and twitter 

1496
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:57,070
and so forth,
our moral amplifiers.

1497
01:14:57,071 --> 01:15:00,250
So we bloody well better be careful 
because we're building super intelligent

1498
01:15:00,251 --> 01:15:03,100
machines and they're going to be 
patterned on us.

1499
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:09,130
So,
so we have to watch our step.

1500
01:15:10,150 --> 01:15:12,070
And that's basically what I've been 
telling people,

1501
01:15:12,071 --> 01:15:12,904
you know,
because I've been trying not to be 

1502
01:15:15,401 --> 01:15:16,234
political about this.
In some sense I think it's a 

1503
01:15:17,831 --> 01:15:22,831
degeneration because I'm more 
philosophically minded and it's it.

1504
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:25,540
When when things become political around
me,

1505
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:27,520
it's like I'm at the wrong level of 
analysis.

1506
01:15:27,521 --> 01:15:32,140
I'm not facing things properly.
But I've also found that,

1507
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:35,860
and this has been a strange thing to 
see,

1508
01:15:35,861 --> 01:15:36,694
I've been talking to people about 
responsibility and truth and and 

1509
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:43,750
religious topics as well now for really 
intensely for the last year,

1510
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:46,480
really for my whole career,
but really intensely for the last year.

1511
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:47,613
And one of the things that strange,
and this is another way the world is 

1512
01:15:49,601 --> 01:15:50,434
upside down,
is that after being fed a nonstop diet 

1513
01:15:53,801 --> 01:15:54,634
of freedom and rights for 60 years,
people are starving to death for a diet 

1514
01:16:00,131 --> 01:16:00,964
of constraint and responsibility.
And who the hell would've ever thought 

1515
01:16:03,971 --> 01:16:04,840
that was salable?

1516
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:05,673
You know what?
I have people coming up to me all the 

1517
01:16:06,461 --> 01:16:07,294
time.
Lots of it already happened many times 

1518
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:08,861
today.
They say,

1519
01:16:08,861 --> 01:16:10,000
well,
you know,

1520
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:11,193
you've talked about responsibility.
I've been listening to your youtube 

1521
01:16:12,941 --> 01:16:14,620
videos.
It's really straighten out in my life.

1522
01:16:14,621 --> 01:16:16,660
I now have a purpose.
I'm not nihilistic.

1523
01:16:16,661 --> 01:16:20,680
And when I talk to people about 
responsibility and rights,

1524
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,640
especially young men in my audiences are
mostly young men.

1525
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:26,680
Man,
you can hear a pin drop.

1526
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:27,941
You think,
well,

1527
01:16:27,941 --> 01:16:29,860
what's going on there?
That's so weird.

1528
01:16:29,861 --> 01:16:33,440
It's like it's this,
it's this crazy inversion.

1529
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:34,293
It's the least salable thing possible 
has become the thing that's most in 

1530
01:16:38,501 --> 01:16:39,790
demand.
Say like,

1531
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:42,280
have a hard life.
Do something difficult.

1532
01:16:42,281 --> 01:16:44,320
Get Yourself,
get your act together quick,

1533
01:16:44,321 --> 01:16:46,840
blaming other people.
Assume that you're the problem.

1534
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:50,200
Start small with like non heroic 
activities.

1535
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:52,690
Don't broadcast it in public,
right?

1536
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:53,673
Pick up something heavy and assume that 
you're contributing in some important 

1537
01:16:57,491 --> 01:17:01,240
manner to the destiny of the world and 
like late your soul quake.

1538
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,670
When you understand what that means and 
everybody's thinking,

1539
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:05,140
yes,
that's exactly what I want to hear.

1540
01:17:05,141 --> 01:17:05,974
It's exactly what it's like.
What the hell [inaudible] and then 

1541
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:19,070
there's these biblical lectures on,
I thought,

1542
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:21,380
I thought this is another upside down 
thing.

1543
01:17:21,381 --> 01:17:22,214
I thought,
okay,

1544
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:24,950
as I put business plans together before 
and you know,

1545
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:28,160
I know how you evaluate a business plan.
So here's the business plan.

1546
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:29,413
I'm going to lay out $60,000 to rent a 
theater for 12 weeks and I'm going to 

1547
01:17:34,101 --> 01:17:34,934
deliver a series of lectures on the 
Bible and that's a profit generating 

1548
01:17:39,441 --> 01:17:42,470
enterprise.
Do you want to invest?

1549
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:44,120
It's like,
you know,

1550
01:17:44,121 --> 01:17:48,680
get this guy needs antipsychotic 
medication and he needs it quickly.

1551
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:52,280
And so,
so I thought,

1552
01:17:52,281 --> 01:17:53,114
well,
I'm doing this because I want to walk 

1553
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:54,794
through these stories.
And the reason I want to walk through 

1554
01:17:56,781 --> 01:17:59,120
these stories is because they're 
foundational stories.

1555
01:17:59,120 --> 01:17:59,953
I understand that there,
there are foundational stories for 

1556
01:18:02,721 --> 01:18:03,554
better or for worse,
and we can't get rid of them without 

1557
01:18:06,261 --> 01:18:09,680
getting rid of the foundation.
And that's a bad idea.

1558
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:13,730
So at least we better understand them 
before we dispense with them,

1559
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,410
you know?
And that goes for me too.

1560
01:18:15,411 --> 01:18:18,770
And so I started doing that and they're 
ridiculously popular.

1561
01:18:18,771 --> 01:18:23,330
Like they always sell out.
The audience is dead silent when and,

1562
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:26,150
and the,
the atmosphere of the room is really,

1563
01:18:26,151 --> 01:18:30,080
really positive.
Not In that Namby Pamby you know,

1564
01:18:30,081 --> 01:18:31,670
wretched,
harmless way,

1565
01:18:31,671 --> 01:18:36,050
but in the sort of charged energy 
looking for a good thing to do way.

1566
01:18:36,051 --> 01:18:38,270
And the questions are really intelligent
and so,

1567
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:39,800
and,
and deep too.

1568
01:18:39,801 --> 01:18:41,390
And so that's really cool.
And then,

1569
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:42,253
you know,
I released them on the net and the most 

1570
01:18:43,731 --> 01:18:47,870
popular video I have ever made is an 
introduction to the idea of God,

1571
01:18:47,871 --> 01:18:52,340
which is the intro to this biblical 
series and it's got like 850,000 views.

1572
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:53,720
And,
and then I get all these,

1573
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:54,733
like Jonathan said,
he's got all these atheists supporting 

1574
01:18:56,631 --> 01:18:58,280
him.
He's a bloody orthodox icon.

1575
01:18:58,281 --> 01:19:00,380
Carvers.
What the hell's up with that?

1576
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:05,740
And like a tremendous number of the 
people who are writing me and commenting

1577
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:07,820
on youtube are also atheists.
They're saying,

1578
01:19:07,821 --> 01:19:08,600
well,
you know,

1579
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,420
I'm an atheist,
committed atheist and,

1580
01:19:10,610 --> 01:19:13,940
but I've been really interested in what 
you've been saying about these religious

1581
01:19:13,941 --> 01:19:14,774
stories.
And so that's another indication of the 

1582
01:19:16,611 --> 01:19:19,580
fact that everything's upside down.
And so,

1583
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,660
and I'm going to keep making those 
biblical videos because I've been trying

1584
01:19:23,661 --> 01:19:24,494
to sort through my priorities and I 
don't know what my priorities are 

1585
01:19:26,481 --> 01:19:30,650
because my life has completely surreal.
Like I,

1586
01:19:30,651 --> 01:19:32,000
it's like I'm in a,
well,

1587
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:34,520
it's like I stepped into a parallel 
universe,

1588
01:19:34,521 --> 01:19:38,630
you know?
And so I've been trying to figure out,

1589
01:19:38,631 --> 01:19:39,660
well what should I be doing?

1590
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:40,493
And one thing I do know is that I had 
been going to continue with those 

1591
01:19:42,651 --> 01:19:45,860
biblical lectures because I think they 
might be the most significant thing that

1592
01:19:45,861 --> 01:19:47,230
I'm doing.
Um,

1593
01:19:48,050 --> 01:19:49,790
okay.
And then I'll just close and say,

1594
01:19:49,791 --> 01:19:51,290
well,
you know,

1595
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:54,530
with my colleagues,
I've also been working on these programs

1596
01:19:54,531 --> 01:19:56,150
that help people get their lives 
together.

1597
01:19:56,151 --> 01:19:57,950
Like the self authoring suite for 
example,

1598
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:00,110
which some of you might be familiar 
with.

1599
01:20:00,111 --> 01:20:00,944
And of course,
one of the things that's been a 

1600
01:20:02,121 --> 01:20:05,930
consequence and we've done research on,
especially the future authoring program,

1601
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:07,710
really helps people,
you know,

1602
01:20:07,711 --> 01:20:10,530
if you give it to university students,
especially the ones that don't know what

1603
01:20:10,531 --> 01:20:11,364
they're doing and are kind of alienated,
they're way more likely to stay in 

1604
01:20:13,801 --> 01:20:15,930
university and they get much better 
grades.

1605
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:19,060
So that's really cool.
And so the,

1606
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:19,953
the Internet and these new communication
channels has also made it possible to 

1607
01:20:22,501 --> 01:20:23,334
deliver reasonably high quality 
psychological interventions that are 

1608
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:28,253
devoted to helping people improve their 
lives and straightening themselves out 

1609
01:20:30,691 --> 01:20:33,300
at extremely low cost,
extraordinarily widely.

1610
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:34,523
And so now thousands and tens of 
thousands of people have done those 

1611
01:20:37,681 --> 01:20:38,514
programs now.
And so I get letters all the time from 

1612
01:20:39,991 --> 01:20:41,880
people saying,
this has really helped me.

1613
01:20:41,881 --> 01:20:42,714
And you know,
I was on the verge of suicide and this 

1614
01:20:43,711 --> 01:20:45,360
brought me back from the brink.
And like,

1615
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:47,610
it's really nice to get letters like 
that,

1616
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:48,473
you know?
And here's something else that's 

1617
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:50,850
interesting.
You know,

1618
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:55,380
people have been assuming that I'd been 
deluged by hate mail,

1619
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:57,280
you know,
so they're feeling kind of sorry for me.

1620
01:20:57,281 --> 01:20:58,114
And like,
I've like had five pieces of hate mail 

1621
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:05,970
in the last year and that's it.
So like I don't understand that it's,

1622
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:06,953
I dunno what it is.
Maybe the sjw types don't have the 

1623
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:11,790
energy to pen a hate letter,
although they certainly seem to,

1624
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:12,893
but for some reason,
although they'll come out and protest 

1625
01:21:15,421 --> 01:21:16,770
like they did it.
Mcmaster,

1626
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,180
they're,
they're not,

1627
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:23,570
they're not really directly going after 
me with,

1628
01:21:23,571 --> 01:21:25,470
with those sorts of channels of 
communication,

1629
01:21:25,471 --> 01:21:29,940
someone spectacularly reprehensible,
just littered my neighborhood.

1630
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:30,833
I actually know who it is littered my 
neighborhood with community safety 

1631
01:21:34,501 --> 01:21:35,550
warnings,
you know,

1632
01:21:35,551 --> 01:21:36,720
claiming that I was,
well,

1633
01:21:36,721 --> 01:21:37,554
you know,
the General Satan himself in various 

1634
01:21:40,381 --> 01:21:44,040
manifestations essentially.
And one of the things that was so funny,

1635
01:21:44,130 --> 01:21:44,963
if you find these sorts of things funny 
is that they have this picture of me 

1636
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:51,210
that's the background of the poster.
Like I'm looking really aggressive,

1637
01:21:51,211 --> 01:21:52,044
a yelling like,
like really like I'm going to bite a 

1638
01:21:53,941 --> 01:21:55,210
child.
And so that's the,

1639
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:58,560
that's that's the community safety 
warning rights.

1640
01:21:58,561 --> 01:21:59,394
Look out for this man and here's,
here's the way they play fast and loose 

1641
01:22:04,171 --> 01:22:05,004
with the truth.
So that picture was from that free 

1642
01:22:06,781 --> 01:22:07,614
speech rally I told you about.
And the reason that I'm yelling is 

1643
01:22:10,351 --> 01:22:13,920
because the same people,
because I know who did it,

1644
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:14,813
the same people,
we're the ones who took the microphone 

1645
01:22:17,071 --> 01:22:18,090
and the PA system.

1646
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:21,420
And so the only way I could communicate 
with the crowd was to yell.

1647
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:24,310
And so I look kind of aggressive and I 
was kind of irritated day.

1648
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,153
It's like what the hell white noise.
You're blasting me with white noise and 

1649
01:22:28,501 --> 01:22:30,930
you're taking the amps and no one's 
doing anything about it.

1650
01:22:30,931 --> 01:22:31,764
It's like I'm not going to stop talking 
because you're because of your dopey 

1651
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,720
tricks.
And so I was,

1652
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:37,613
you know,
reasonably fired up and I had to talk 

1653
01:22:39,601 --> 01:22:42,240
really loudly cause there was white 
noise blaring.

1654
01:22:42,510 --> 01:22:43,343
And so that's the picture that they use 
to show the demonic side of Jordan 

1655
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,690
Peterson.
And that's such a lie.

1656
01:22:48,691 --> 01:22:49,524
Aa.
That's the lies embedded right in the 

1657
01:22:50,761 --> 01:22:51,594
poster.
It's like the only thing you could find 

1658
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:54,384
that would make me look reprehensible is
an action that I took as a direct 

1659
01:22:57,061 --> 01:23:00,000
consequence of your misbehavior in a 
public forum.

1660
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,313
But they don't care.
They don't care or maybe they do care 

1661
01:23:03,931 --> 01:23:06,970
and maybe they're happy that the base of
the poster is a,

1662
01:23:07,210 --> 01:23:10,030
is there an extraordinarily deceptive 
false hood?

1663
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,070
You know,
they're happy about that.

1664
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,950
So.
All right,

1665
01:23:14,951 --> 01:23:15,880
so let's sum up,

1666
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:18,940
okay.

1667
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:19,773
You know,
I'm not going to make a case for the 

1668
01:23:20,741 --> 01:23:24,280
antipathy of the old media to the new 
media because I've actually been treated

1669
01:23:24,281 --> 01:23:25,114
pretty well by the old media.
And I can tell you that the Canadian 

1670
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:28,924
journalists,
the ones that you respect are very much 

1671
01:23:31,241 --> 01:23:32,074
afraid for their personal safety,
for the reputation and for their 

1672
01:23:37,091 --> 01:23:40,630
livelihood.
And so they're actually quite brave.

1673
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:41,733
Margaret went is a good example of that,
but so are the other people that I 

1674
01:23:44,201 --> 01:23:45,034
listed.
Christie Blatchford is another one and 

1675
01:23:46,671 --> 01:23:48,380
it's,
and it's an anti Nela

1676
01:23:50,510 --> 01:23:53,920
still didn't get it
anyways.

1677
01:23:54,190 --> 01:23:55,023
So it's not like they're high and mighty
people who have a tremendous amount of 

1678
01:23:58,091 --> 01:24:01,310
power who are like misusing their status
there.

1679
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:03,580
They're not there.
They're walking on eggshells.

1680
01:24:03,581 --> 01:24:08,581
All those media empires are crumbling,
crumbling,

1681
01:24:08,591 --> 01:24:10,360
like mad the globe and Mail is 
crumbling.

1682
01:24:10,361 --> 01:24:11,194
CBC is crumbling.
They can't get anybody to watch any of 

1683
01:24:13,541 --> 01:24:15,850
their stuff online because they don't 
understand the,

1684
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:17,043
the,
uh,

1685
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:18,213
the,
um,

1686
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:19,450
the ethos.

1687
01:24:20,110 --> 01:24:24,340
But like,
I don't see it as a polarization exactly

1688
01:24:24,341 --> 01:24:25,174
between the old media and the new media.
I just see it as we're in the brave new 

1689
01:24:28,331 --> 01:24:32,020
world of instantaneous,
permanent verbal communication.

1690
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,033
And no one has any idea what that means.
And so it's producing all these strange 

1691
01:24:37,511 --> 01:24:38,344
phenomena like these new youtube stars 
that have really come out of nowhere 

1692
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:43,390
and,
and,

1693
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:47,540
and people are attracted to them because
of the raw [inaudible] and their,

1694
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:49,510
and their unedited quality.
You know,

1695
01:24:49,511 --> 01:24:51,880
when Joe Rogan posts,
hosts posts a video,

1696
01:24:51,881 --> 01:24:52,714
it's every bit of it's posted.
So you get to make up your own mind 

1697
01:24:55,751 --> 01:24:56,584
about what you're going to conclude.
And so that seems to be a really good 

1698
01:24:59,051 --> 01:24:59,884
thing.
So maybe that means that free speech is 

1699
01:25:01,031 --> 01:25:02,330
alive and well,
you know,

1700
01:25:02,331 --> 01:25:05,170
and maybe it's even flourishing.
Who knows?

1701
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,273
So I can't draw any real conclusions 
about where we're at with regards to 

1702
01:25:13,051 --> 01:25:15,700
media except the one I started with,
which,

1703
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:18,480
which is,
and it's sort of related to this message

1704
01:25:18,481 --> 01:25:20,630
of personal responsibility,
which is a,

1705
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:25,480
your voice is amplified far beyond what 
it ever has been in the past.

1706
01:25:25,481 --> 01:25:29,470
If for every single one of us and it can
get amplified if you're not careful,

1707
01:25:29,471 --> 01:25:33,490
it can get amplified way more than you'd
ever hope or suspect.

1708
01:25:33,491 --> 01:25:34,091
Like,
you know,

1709
01:25:34,091 --> 01:25:36,670
if you make the wrong mistake in your 
life,

1710
01:25:36,671 --> 01:25:39,910
at some point you could be the next 
viral video.

1711
01:25:40,210 --> 01:25:43,000
You know?
And that's pretty terrifying thought and

1712
01:25:43,001 --> 01:25:45,190
it's no wonder people are anxious about 
all of that.

1713
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:48,220
But I do think it amplifies your effect 
on the world.

1714
01:25:48,221 --> 01:25:52,030
And so it's all the more reason to get 
your act together and to be careful with

1715
01:25:52,031 --> 01:25:54,040
what you say and be careful with what 
you do.

1716
01:25:54,041 --> 01:25:54,874
Because now we're at a point in history 
where the fact that you're intimately 

1717
01:25:59,170 --> 01:26:04,170
connected with the rest of mankind,
let's say present and future is manifest

1718
01:26:04,731 --> 01:26:05,564
almost instantaneously.
And we need to take that seriously and 

1719
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:10,123
hopefully we can take it seriously 
enough so that we ramp the polarization 

1720
01:26:14,061 --> 01:26:15,470
back,
you know,

1721
01:26:15,471 --> 01:26:16,304
and figure out how to communicate with 
one another and put things straight 

1722
01:26:18,951 --> 01:26:22,340
again at a deep level so that we can 
move towards a positive future.

1723
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:23,840
Cause we could have one,
you know,

1724
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:25,063
like things are shaky and chaotic right 
now in strange and surreal on multiple 

1725
01:26:29,631 --> 01:26:30,464
dimensions.
But we're also on the cusp of a 

1726
01:26:31,851 --> 01:26:32,684
technological revolution,
the likes of which no one can even 

1727
01:26:34,971 --> 01:26:38,900
conceive.
And maybe things could become incredibly

1728
01:26:38,901 --> 01:26:42,530
much better if we're,
if we walk carefully and think carefully

1729
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:44,240
and orient ourselves properly.
And,

1730
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,513
and,
and so that's what I hope that we all 

1731
01:26:47,601 --> 01:26:48,434
do.
And that's what I'm trying to promote 

1732
01:26:49,731 --> 01:26:51,890
when I do my videos and all of that.
So,

1733
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:53,990
um,
and that seems to,

1734
01:26:54,230 --> 01:26:57,380
people seem to find that useful and they
actually seem to be doing it.

1735
01:26:57,381 --> 01:26:58,214
And I think that's better than engaging 
in the polarized wars and trying to be 

1736
01:27:01,161 --> 01:27:03,050
right and when the arguments and all of 
that,

1737
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:05,600
because I just don't think that that's 
going to work.

1738
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:06,973
So,
so be careful and be awake and pay 

1739
01:27:12,021 --> 01:27:15,140
attention to what you say and clean up 
your rooms.

1740
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:18,590
And that's good enough.
Thank you.

1741
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:26,900
[inaudible].

1742
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:31,110
All right.

1743
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:32,393
Yes.

1744
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,780
So our next thing will be the q and a 
paddle.

1745
01:27:38,810 --> 01:27:41,180
We will get that going as soon as 
possible.

1746
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:42,410
Uh,
but for the moment,

1747
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:44,930
we are millennials and we do want some 
group pictures,

1748
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:46,340
so bear with us.

1749
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:53,123
Yeah.
