1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,290
Yeah,

2
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,160
I'm talking today to clear layman who's,
who's rich,

3
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:25,161
needed a magazine online called Colette,
which I think is become quite popular 

4
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:30,271
and quite successful in relatively short
period of time and it's certainly a 

5
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:34,251
magazine that I've come to admire.
It looks like it's staffed by real 

6
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:38,181
journalists and so we're going to talk 
today a little bit about how she's 

7
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:41,370
managed that and well in general and 
about what her,

8
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,420
her aims and ambitions are.
So I guess we might as well start.

9
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:50,421
Claire,
you could introduce yourself to my 

10
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:50,421
audience and,
and tell,

11
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:53,220
tell them who,
who you are and how you managed this.

12
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,420
Okay.
So,

13
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,470
um,
I am a former graduate student in 

14
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,781
psychology,
but before I went back to graduate 

15
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:04,170
school I,
uh,

16
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:06,970
I was working,
had a couple of different jobs.

17
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:13,230
My first degree was in English,
so I always wanted to be a teacher of 

18
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:17,890
literature.
Stories had that aesthetic interest.

19
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,750
I just had sort of a crisis in my 
graduate studies where I realized that 

20
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:29,140
wasn't for me and I wanted to pursue 
writing,

21
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:34,141
but I knew there was nowhere that would 
publish the stuff that I wanted to 

22
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:35,050
write.
And I thought,

23
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:37,180
well,
why don't I build my own platform?

24
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,830
And in the back of my mind I knew that 
there were people that I knew,

25
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:43,870
academics that I knew,
um,

26
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,710
who would also grab the opportunity to 
be published.

27
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:54,190
So what made you think that there was 
nobody there that would publish the 

28
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:54,190
sorts of things that you wanted to?
Right.

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,900
Alright.
So it's fairly simple.

30
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,550
Um,
I,

31
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,510
I was working on an article about a 
psychologist called lead Justin,

32
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,890
who he's a social psychologist who 
studies the accuracy of stereotypes.

33
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,730
And so it's a,
it was a long form,

34
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,550
signed a article about a scientific 
topic but completely contradicts a left 

35
00:02:21,711 --> 00:02:26,711
wing kind of narratives.
And those two things don't find an easy 

36
00:02:27,051 --> 00:02:32,051
home.
So there's a lot of conservative places 

37
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:32,360
that,
uh,

38
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,670
published sort of conservative 
commentary,

39
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:39,671
but it's often just about economics or 
some kind of partisan political battle.

40
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,120
And it interested in sciences is not 
very deep.

41
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,220
However,
the place,

42
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:51,221
the best places for scientific 
journalism such as the Guardian or wide 

43
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:54,910
or scientific American,
they weren't going mia.

44
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,920
Anything that contradicts very strong 
left wing narrative such as stereotype 

45
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,870
accuracy or the biology of sex 
differences,

46
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,090
intelligence research.
So there's these areas of the behavioral

47
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:15,091
sciences that don't find a platform and 
I just wanted to create that platform 

48
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:19,810
and I also wanted to publish.

49
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,860
I'm not just scientific stuff,
but a sort of classical liberal and any 

50
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:32,731
kind of commentary that doesn't indulge 
in these regressive postmodernist kind 

51
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:35,560
of narrative.
I wanted to,

52
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,290
to,
to make it a free space for that.

53
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,270
And some of my early,
um,

54
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,440
contribute is where one of my earliest 
contributed.

55
00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:50,000
This was a guy called Geoffrey Taylor 
who was an editor at the Atlantic and he

56
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:55,001
wrote for places like the new republic,
but they stopped publishing his pieces 

57
00:03:55,761 --> 00:04:00,761
because he became critical of Islam and 
he wanted to write pieces that were 

58
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:03,830
critical of Islam and he couldn't get 
published even though he was this,

59
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:05,320
um,
you know,

60
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:10,330
they'd publish his other work,
but anything that he wanted to publish 

61
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,640
that was critical of Islam just wouldn't
get past stitches.

62
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,450
So publish it.

63
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,710
Sure.
What you found was a implicit censorship

64
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:22,220
in some sense.
That's not the case.

65
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,260
It's an exquisite censorship in many 
cases,

66
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:29,261
so the stereotype literature is 
interesting because one of the things 

67
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:32,800
the so called stereotype researchers 
have failed to do is two distinct 

68
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,500
stereotype from heuristics.
Yeah.

69
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:39,501
People use low resolution 
representations of the world all the 

70
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:43,691
time too soon and it's absolutely vital 
that we do that we we cannot function 

71
00:04:44,181 --> 00:04:47,890
without,
without categorization and they.

72
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,420
I know this was a problem with bondage 
sheets work and she did some of the 

73
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,460
early work on stereotyping and remember 
she did a talk at Harvard when I was 

74
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,121
teaching in Boston and she was taken to 
task by the audience who weren't all 

75
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:06,131
social psychologists for failing to 
distinguish between categorization and 

76
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:10,570
stereotyping and.
But that's actually a really big 

77
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,330
problem.
It's not a trivial issue with regards to

78
00:05:11,331 --> 00:05:16,331
the research and so yeah.
I don't remember the name of the 

79
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:16,390
psychologist that you interview.

80
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,930
Yeah.
So his name is Lee Justin.

81
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,220
He's a psychologist at Rutgers 
University and I'm.

82
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,750
Hey was one of the founders of the 
Heterodox Academy.

83
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,700
Okay.
Yeah,

84
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:35,701
and he has a blog called rabble rouser 
at psychology today and I discovered 

85
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:39,370
that back in 2015.
I think it was,

86
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,910
and he had these amazing essays about 
how he has battled group thing,

87
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:50,041
can left wing bias in his area of social
social psychology and he's got these 

88
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:56,341
amazing anecdotes and stories about how 
science in his particular area has not 

89
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:58,610
been self correcting.

90
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,620
Yes.
Well see psychology as being corrupt.

91
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:04,630
Discipline for about 25 years as far as 
I can tell.

92
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:07,910
And you know,
you see that reflected in things like,

93
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:10,200
um,
the political work that's been done.

94
00:06:10,201 --> 00:06:12,120
So what's it called?
Um,

95
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,030
system justification,
for example,

96
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,780
social psychology that's being put 
forward by John Joseph,

97
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:25,180
I remember correctly.
He's a student of Missouri and bond and 

98
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,180
she on there,
there's a,

99
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,140
there's definitely an implicit left bias
there because the notion fundamentally 

100
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:34,590
is that if you are justifying the 
current system in any way,

101
00:06:34,591 --> 00:06:39,591
which means that you know,
you might have some element of 

102
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:40,920
patriotism in your thinking or believed 
that the system isn't just an oppressive

103
00:06:40,921 --> 00:06:44,340
patriarchy that are,
that that actually constitutes something

104
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:48,390
approximating a political pathology.
So it's,

105
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:51,920
it's really pernicious because it's,
it's,

106
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:57,030
it's built into the terminology rather 
than being an explicit part of the 

107
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:57,480
theory.
And you know,

108
00:06:57,481 --> 00:07:00,660
the other thing that I noticed too that 
that was very interesting to me,

109
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:05,661
it took me decades to figure this out,
was that there was people have been 

110
00:07:05,661 --> 00:07:10,281
studying the authoritarian personality 
basically since the end of World War 

111
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:10,281
Two.

112
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:15,020
Right.
And there's the authoritarian 

113
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,590
personality scale that Adorno,
if I remember correctly,

114
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:19,650
it's the theater or donor developed and 
you know,

115
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:24,651
for a long time I was trying to figure 
out why in the world there wasn't the 

116
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:25,760
equivalent on the left.
You know,

117
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,240
it's really,
I mean,

118
00:07:27,241 --> 00:07:32,241
I hate to speak in conspiratorial terms,
but it's essentially a conspiratorial 

119
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:36,651
movement that that's deeply embedded 
within social psychology to deny the 

120
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:39,990
existence of authoritarian authoritarian
tendencies on the left wing.

121
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:44,040
No one's managing good authoritarian 
left weighing scale.

122
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:49,041
And it's partly because it's partly 
because of the tremendous denial post 

123
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:54,651
world war two that anything like leftist
authoritarianism could exist and really 

124
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,000
took me a long time to sort that out.
I couldn't,

125
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,590
I couldn't understand why that glaring 
absence existed.

126
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:06,591
And we've been trying to rectify that in
my lab and trying to do that in a 

127
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:07,500
politically neutral way.
You know,

128
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:12,060
by doing a large scale,
a factor analysis of collections,

129
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:17,061
of political beliefs so that we can look
at it from a relatively objective 

130
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:21,231
perspective without trying to drive home
some eight priority political belief.

131
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:27,310
So,
so you said you had a crisis in some 

132
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,690
sense when you were in graduate school 
at pursuing psychology and what did that

133
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:31,440
consist of?

134
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:37,010
Uh,
there were lots of factors going on and 

135
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,471
I had some issues with the course.
I was doing forensic psychology and I 

136
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:47,031
found um,
the way it was run a little bit flexible

137
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:51,630
and authoritarian and I'm a mother so I 
had,

138
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,700
I had my son needs now for,
but at the time was just the baby and I 

139
00:08:57,031 --> 00:09:00,270
needed a lot of flexibility and they 
couldn't accommodate me.

140
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,090
And um,
I just,

141
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:08,450
I just felt there was,
I could offer more through writing and 

142
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,470
through communication of scientific 
ideas.

143
00:09:12,471 --> 00:09:14,510
Then being a practicing psychologist.
I mean,

144
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:17,900
I don't want to get into the full 
backstory of what happened in my course,

145
00:09:17,901 --> 00:09:19,060
but,
um,

146
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:25,030
I,
I have have very cynical feelings 

147
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,030
towards universities in general.
I,

148
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:29,370
I'm,
yeah,

149
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,770
I went,
I went back to graduate school at.

150
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:36,540
I ha.
I thought that I thought that,

151
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,630
you know,
considering all of the rhetoric,

152
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,480
uh,
um,

153
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,080
around,
you know,

154
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,110
helping,
helping women and helping people pursue 

155
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,731
their creative.
I thought that there would be some 

156
00:09:52,731 --> 00:09:53,970
flexibility for a young mother,
but there really wasn't an um,

157
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,580
but that,
that was not the only issue though,

158
00:09:56,581 --> 00:09:58,080
other issues.
But yeah,

159
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,810
it's said it's,
I don't know if I really wanted.

160
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,660
Yeah,
but you don't want it.

161
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:11,090
I was just what exactly it was that put 
you on this alternative path.

162
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,790
And so how long have you been running 
quill out?

163
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,940
Since November 2015.

164
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,710
Okay.
So it's pretty new.

165
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,140
Yeah.
So what did you tell us how you did that

166
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,200
and how you've got,
how you've attracted writers and how 

167
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,431
you've grown and,
and I'd like to know everything about 

168
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:36,611
it,
including whatever it is that you're 

169
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:38,351
doing for a monetization strategy 
because the fact that you've been able 

170
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:41,210
to launch a new,
what would you call it?

171
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:46,211
A new domain,
a new enterprise devoted to journalism.

172
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,550
This really quite surprising because,
I mean it's,

173
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:55,180
you bailed out of psychology into 
journalism and I got out of the fire 

174
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:59,120
into the frying pan because that's not 
exactly something that you'd consider if

175
00:10:59,121 --> 00:11:02,000
you had a business proposal and 
presented that to someone who said,

176
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:07,001
well,
I'm going to start a new site devoted 

177
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:07,001
towards journalism,
you know,

178
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:08,960
I think you'd be laughed out of the 
venture capitalist's office because it's

179
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,900
so.
It's so difficult to monetize journalism

180
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:12,440
now.
So.

181
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,340
So tell me a little bit about how you,
how you got this all going?

182
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,770
Well,
I was just brainstorming with my husband

183
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:23,940
one night domain names,
so I knew that to start a website,

184
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:29,450
uh,
I needed an original domain name and we 

185
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,690
were just brainstorming and I didn't 
know where that came from,

186
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:35,310
but it just came into my head and we 
looked that up and that was available.

187
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,330
So I bought the domain name.
I was running my own blog.

188
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,660
So I transferred my own log over to this
new domain and put all of my old essays.

189
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,540
Are Penn,
played around with what the website 

190
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,961
would look like for about two weeks.
I was playing around with these 

191
00:11:56,961 --> 00:12:01,330
statistics and I'm not a developer so I 
had to use sort of a website template 

192
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,920
out of the box,
so the aesthetics were really important 

193
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,840
to me and I knew that if I was going to 
do something had to look really good and

194
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:15,841
so I was playing around with that and 
then I put the word out through social 

195
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:21,871
media that I was going to launch a site 
and would anyone like to contribute and 

196
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:26,551
I happened to have some context in my 
social network who had essays up their 

197
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:27,520
sleeves.

198
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:32,690
My two first contributors were a Brian 
Boutwell who is a criminologist at St 

199
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,240
Louis University and Jamie,
who's an excellent writer based in 

200
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,040
London and Brian.
He started.

201
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,070
His first essay was about being a 
criminologist who studies biology and 

202
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:52,921
about being shunned by his field and he.
I didn't realize he was such a brilliant

203
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:57,610
writer before I started writing.
For me it just,

204
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,570
it was just pure luck that he happened 
to be such brilliant rider.

205
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,910
The second essay that he published 
something like 100,000

206
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:11,911
views in just a few weeks,
so we immediately sort of exploded and 

207
00:13:11,911 --> 00:13:16,561
that was just due to the quality of the 
contributors that I had straight away 

208
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:21,330
would be relatable for the first is the 
first one was on chrome,

209
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:28,080
biosocial criminology.
The second one was on behavioral 

210
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,791
genetics and the essay was about how 
parenting might not shape your 

211
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:39,850
personality as much as you think it 
does,

212
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,020
uh,
because he,

213
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,810
he and he was explaining the data from 
twin studies and um,

214
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,870
it was just such a well written and 
counterintuitive kind of essay just 

215
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:57,271
exploded.
So I mean lots of people disagreed with 

216
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:57,271
it.
Um,

217
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:57,271
but it,
it,

218
00:13:57,271 --> 00:14:00,040
it made a huge impact.
And I'm.

219
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,020
Jake go to

220
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:07,020
the heart of the conflict between the 
social constructionist and the 

221
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,100
biologists.
Yeah,

222
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,190
I know that's a new word that sort of 
emerged.

223
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:11,500
I don't know if it's specific to Canada 
or north,

224
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:16,501
but the word is biological essentialist.
Then that seems to be like a social 

225
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,860
justice warrior code for Fascist as far 
as I can tell.

226
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:26,470
And you know,
biological essentialist seems to be 

227
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,131
anyone who believes that there's any 
degree of biological influence on any 

228
00:14:29,131 --> 00:14:31,150
element of human character whatsoever.
And you know,

229
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:36,630
last year I was concerned because of 
what was happening in Canada that being 

230
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,150
a biologist was eventually going to be 
illegal in some sense,

231
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:45,151
which I actually believe it is 
technically a certain provisions of our 

232
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:49,861
law because it's PLC 16,
that audio post last year,

233
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:55,201
which was passed nationally,
has written social constructionism into 

234
00:14:55,201 --> 00:14:56,830
the law.
So our law now,

235
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,210
now,
it was predicated on the idea that their

236
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:04,130
relationship between biological sex,
gender expression,

237
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,520
gender identity and sexual proclivity,
which are all to this independent 

238
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,020
factors are in fact technically 
independent.

239
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,180
That there is no causal relationship 
between them.

240
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,760
And which is palpably absurd notion 
because the,

241
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,980
the correlation between them,
you know,

242
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:27,100
make biological males almost always have
a male gender identity.

243
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:31,740
They almost always act and dress like 
males and they're almost always hidden.

244
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Sexual.
It's the correlations across the levels 

245
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,731
are almost all or,
or exceed point nine five across all of 

246
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,270
the levels.
And yet the law.

247
00:15:41,271 --> 00:15:46,271
Now it's technically the case that you 
have to treat those as independent and,

248
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,230
and that and that,
uh,

249
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,200
suggesting that they're not like,
I can't,

250
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:53,510
I can't say that it's tantamount to hate
speech,

251
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:56,510
but I would say that it's close to that 
and the,

252
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:01,750
I don't know if you've seen the sort of 
ridiculous animations that have been 

253
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,540
used,
animated drawings,

254
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:07,541
like the ginger,
the genderbread person or the gender 

255
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:07,541
Unicorn.

256
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,690
Yeah,
yeah,

257
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:09,810
yeah.
I have.

258
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Yeah.
And so those are being pushed forward 

259
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:15,440
very hard in institutions all across 
Canada,

260
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,460
elementary schools,
junior high schools,

261
00:16:17,461 --> 00:16:18,930
the military,
the police,

262
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,960
you name it,
where there's this tremendous emphasis 

263
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,030
on the social construction of identity 
and it's as if a social constructionists

264
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,040
have taken to the law to enforce what 
they cannot prove scientifically what 

265
00:16:31,261 --> 00:16:36,261
they failed to prove scientific or 
what's even being disproved 

266
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,800
scientifically would be a more accurate 
way of thinking about it.

267
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:40,590
Then the fact that there was an all out 
assault on,

268
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:45,710
on biology by the left is unbelievably 
ominous in my estimation.

269
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,980
Yeah,
I agree.

270
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,160
Just two things on that.
We've got an article coming out on 

271
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,460
quizlet written by two evolutionary 
psychologists on the false dichotomy 

272
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:03,810
between sex and gender and they give it 
some historical context.

273
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:09,481
So the fault,
that false dichotomy I think started 

274
00:17:09,481 --> 00:17:09,610
with Moonee.
Yes,

275
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,670
exactly.
And it's,

276
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:16,790
and then it was weaponized by feminists 
to deny biology entered,

277
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,940
denied sex differences basically.
Um,

278
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:26,440
so that's a very strange thing for 
feminists to do it.

279
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,160
One of

280
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,800
the things that James Damore has just 
pointed out lately,

281
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:31,960
he's the guy that wrote that memo for 
Google,

282
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:37,770
is that the problem with denying the sex
differences is that you automatically 

283
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:41,770
make the argument that if there are sex 
differences,

284
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,580
essentially they're making the argument 
that the female differences or something

285
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:49,300
like inferior because why would you 
object to their existence?

286
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,610
And the Moore's memo was actually quite 
careful because he said,

287
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:58,611
well we should take a look at these 
differences and if we want to maximize 

288
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:01,791
the economic utility of women,
which seems to be a reasonable thing to 

289
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:05,481
do,
then we should actually have a serious 

290
00:18:05,481 --> 00:18:07,761
discussion about what the differences 
are and see if we can set up our 

291
00:18:07,761 --> 00:18:09,320
institution so that we can take 
advantage of the,

292
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,360
of the difference in perspective and 
orientation,

293
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:14,730
but the two sexes might bring to bear on
the,

294
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,850
on the workplace and on,
on economic issues in general.

295
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,780
And you don't use that happening because
people are starting to sort themselves 

296
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,011
out into occupations bisects essentially
and you know,

297
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:33,201
the longterm social consequences of that
aren't obvious and we don't know how to 

298
00:18:33,201 --> 00:18:33,540
balance that.
But it's,

299
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:38,650
it doesn't,
it isn't necessarily the case that it's 

300
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:38,650
a bad thing.

301
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:43,310
Yeah.
And my position has always been that 

302
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:46,510
women have probably more to lose when 
sex differences are denied.

303
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:52,170
I think because of women's biological 
clock and the fact that we bear much 

304
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:59,590
more of a burden when it comes to child 
bearing and child weary.

305
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,580
If you denied that,
you know,

306
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,590
women pay a huge price,
if,

307
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:10,650
if you denied the fact that what women 
go through that to bear children,

308
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:15,710
like firstly I think we need to separate
mothers out from women.

309
00:19:15,711 --> 00:19:20,711
There's,
there's sort of a completion when we 

310
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:22,951
talk about things like the gender gap 
where there's a lot of the rhetoric 

311
00:19:23,351 --> 00:19:25,930
implies that all women are discriminated
against.

312
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,940
The women who pay a penalty,
our mothers and we need to talk about 

313
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,881
that more and we,
we shouldn't minimize the,

314
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,040
the work and the sacrifice and,
and the,

315
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:40,700
the,
the,

316
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:45,701
the costs and the Nag that we've been 
pouring into that.

317
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:48,460
And I think when we deny sex 
differences,

318
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,470
we sort of,
we,

319
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,560
we do,
we minimize and we sort of dismiss 

320
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,290
everything that women do that is female 
normative,

321
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,210
such as caring and,
and,

322
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,240
and working for others and sacrificing 
pay for their children.

323
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:10,960
And you know,
all of these things.

324
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,480
Right?
Well,

325
00:20:13,481 --> 00:20:17,120
no,
I had a baby a month ago.

326
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,640
We were talking to her last night.
She's trying to finish up her degree.

327
00:20:21,641 --> 00:20:24,260
She's also had some health problems that
have interfered with that.

328
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:29,870
You know,
she was talking to us last night about 

329
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:29,870
and she looked tired,
she had bags under her eyes.

330
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,120
I mean,
she's very happy to have the baby and 

331
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,881
it's going very well and all of that,
but the first year after you have a 

332
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:36,160
baby,
you're basically done.

333
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,010
You don't get it,
you don't get any sleep.

334
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,940
You're absolutely overwhelmed,
especially for the first six months with

335
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:43,710
a new incident,
big,

336
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,880
especially if you're a first time mother
because like,

337
00:20:45,881 --> 00:20:50,881
what the hell do you know,
taking care of this incredibly 

338
00:20:50,881 --> 00:20:54,241
complicated thing and it produces all 
sorts of biochemical changes and it's 

339
00:20:54,241 --> 00:20:58,471
really hard on your body and there's a 
long recovery period and you're much 

340
00:20:58,471 --> 00:21:01,360
more dependent on your familial 
structure than you were before.

341
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,310
And yeah,
the I like,

342
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,600
I mean,
it's crazy that we even have to have 

343
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,401
this conversation,
but I like your distinction between 

344
00:21:11,401 --> 00:21:13,921
women and mothers and you know,
there's one of the problems that I've 

345
00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:16,000
had with classic feminism,
if you could use that term,

346
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:20,200
is that there's absolutely no respect 
built into it for the maternal role.

347
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,400
And I really think that that's,
that's appalling on a variety of levels,

348
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,460
including appalling for men because one 
of the things I've experienced is that 

349
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,800
I've had a pretty intense career.
I would say I've been very fortunate in 

350
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,570
that manner.
I've had a lot of,

351
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,100
some meal you'll support and support 
from my wife for that and you know,

352
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:44,101
we kind of parsed our life up in a 
relatively traditional manner because 

353
00:21:44,101 --> 00:21:46,840
she was quite interested in having 
children by the time we got together.

354
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:50,830
And um,
I was perfectly willing to go along with

355
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:55,550
the artist if I could also continue what
might my career pursuits,

356
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,210
which were also necessary for our 
financial stability.

357
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:03,210
But for me,
like the domestic realm has been an 

358
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,340
incredibly meaningful part of my life.
Like I,

359
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:09,420
I,
I'm really happy in my marriage and 

360
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,990
blast I would say in my marriage.
And I loved having kids.

361
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:12,730
And,
and for me,

362
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:17,731
my home has always been a refuge from,
from the insanity of the world in some 

363
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:19,690
sense.
And I think our society is,

364
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,160
it's so crazily skewed towards public 
performance.

365
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:29,161
Let's say that we've denied the utility 
of the domestic sphere and that really 

366
00:22:29,651 --> 00:22:34,651
is terrible for women because especially
with regards to kids because that is 

367
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:37,900
their,
that is the role that they dominate,

368
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:38,680
let's say,
or,

369
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:42,940
or Dominique did they contribute most 
mightily to,

370
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:47,970
let's put it that way.
And it's almost as if our society 

371
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,020
regards that as kind of an emphasis 
innominate,

372
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,250
you know,
and I think it's crazy.

373
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:52,900
I think it makes people miserable

374
00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:00,210
and I understand why the early feminists
sort of downplayed the domestic sphere 

375
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,540
because they,
they were trapped in the domestic sphere

376
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:11,541
and they wanted opportunities and I'm a.
I'm one of those women who would have 

377
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:17,390
been an early feminist probably because 
I crave intellectual stimulation and I 

378
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:22,221
would have been,
if I'd never had an opportunity to have 

379
00:23:22,221 --> 00:23:22,221
a career,
I would have been bored and that kind of

380
00:23:22,221 --> 00:23:27,021
thing.
But now in 2017 I can go and get a job 

381
00:23:27,691 --> 00:23:30,980
as a psychologist that can run a website
and you know,

382
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:36,190
I can do everything that a man can,
but I'm still biologically a female.

383
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:41,961
And so when it comes to having kids,
a cost is on me and the women in my 

384
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:42,780
life,
for example,

385
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:43,820
um,
my,

386
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,480
my own mother who super and comes and 
helps with the children,

387
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:52,780
I see how we,
we don't keep that status and prestige 

388
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:52,780
anymore.
And it's,

389
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:57,410
it's just this a male normative sphere 
where you can monetize something or 

390
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,030
something,
like you said,

391
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:03,920
public performance.
We can,

392
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,950
we afford that status and prestige.
But this invisible caring work that 

393
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:13,120
women are so good at and some women are 
exceptional that it's supported.

394
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,970
No prestige whatsoever.
It was Austin,

395
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,100
you know,
I noticed with kids,

396
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:24,130
for example,
even though our little kids were very 

397
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:24,130
well behaved,
that she was treated,

398
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,040
she wasn't treated well in,
in the public sphere,

399
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:29,750
she wasn't treated well in restaurants.
I think people were afraid.

400
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:31,850
I think that was part of it in some 
sense.

401
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:36,851
You know,
they were afraid that if she showed up 

402
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:36,851
in a public place with children that 
there would be disruption of one form or

403
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:37,280
another.
So,

404
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:42,580
but it was certainly the case that I 
would say she received the opposite of 

405
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:46,721
respect.
And you know my look deeply into 

406
00:24:46,721 --> 00:24:47,450
architect will symbolism and the 
function that it plays,

407
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:52,451
and of course one of the divine images 
that sits at the bottom of western 

408
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:53,770
culture,
not only western culture,

409
00:24:53,771 --> 00:24:58,250
is the image of the divine mother and 
the mother of the savior of humanity,

410
00:24:58,251 --> 00:25:03,251
which is an archetypal idea because 
every baby has the possibility of 

411
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:03,560
growing up to be a redemptive figure.

412
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:09,100
Now that's.
That's the reason that that's an 

413
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,651
archetypal figures because any society 
that doesn't worship that so to speak 

414
00:25:11,651 --> 00:25:15,791
doesn't give it a a very high value will
nourish the fact of the declining,

415
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:22,540
the catastrophic declining birth rate in
the West is a real example of our 

416
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:26,800
willful blindness towards that sacred 
image and it's a big problem and it is 

417
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,940
the case that I think if,
if the,

418
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:33,950
if the feminists we're actually working 
on behalf of femininity,

419
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,280
which is essentially what they claim,
that they would be working a hell of a 

420
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
lot harder to elevate the status of 
mothers.

421
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:41,510
You know,
women.

422
00:25:41,511 --> 00:25:43,670
I think that's a really good distinction
that you're drawing,

423
00:25:43,671 --> 00:25:45,550
even though it seems rather self 
evident.

424
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:50,790
It's not.
And you're not the same once you become 

425
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:50,790
a mother,
you're a different sort of person.

426
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:56,170
And I also think women who don't have 
children or rather intimidated and 

427
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:00,851
afraid of that,
and that's perfectly understandable 

428
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,030
because it isn't radical transformation.
But I would also say,

429
00:26:02,031 --> 00:26:05,450
and I've thought this for years,
that you don't actually become mature.

430
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:07,850
You don't actually become an adult until
you have children.

431
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,210
And I know that that's a statement that 
irritates the hell out of people,

432
00:26:11,211 --> 00:26:14,480
but it's,
it's something that I stand by it.

433
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,230
You're not an adult until someone else 
matters more than you do.

434
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,720
And,
and you know what it is to set,

435
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,610
to make real sacrifices.

436
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:25,960
Yes,
exactly.

437
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,390
Well,
and especially as a mother,

438
00:26:28,391 --> 00:26:32,790
you sacrifice yourself as the person of 
prime importance and,

439
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,910
and,
and you know,

440
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:34,960
you,
you do it,

441
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:39,990
I suppose happily in some sense because 
generally you fall in love with your 

442
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,430
baby relatively rapidly.
And thank God for that because there are

443
00:26:42,431 --> 00:26:43,950
lots of,
um,

444
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:49,370
you know,
I was recounting the story of my 

445
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:51,231
daughter and she is trying to,
she was planning to take a course in 

446
00:26:51,231 --> 00:26:55,611
biology online this,
this semester in order to move towards 

447
00:26:55,611 --> 00:26:57,430
the completion of her degree.
And we told her last night,

448
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,480
she said she was overwhelmed when we 
went and talked to her last night and we

449
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:05,481
told her just to leave it be because 
first year is so intense that you're,

450
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,680
you're completely overwhelmed by it and 
it's necessary because you want to get 

451
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,300
your baby off to a good start and get 
that relationship functioning properly.

452
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:17,830
Yeah,
exactly.

453
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:23,020
And that's one of the issues I had with 
my master's degree.

454
00:27:23,021 --> 00:27:28,021
I couldn't bring myself to do a thesis 
because I wasn't going to have the 

455
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:32,881
energy or the motivation to do it.
Instead I created a website which is,

456
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,700
which also requires a lot of energy,
but it's um,

457
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,730
it's sort of self generative because 
people write articles,

458
00:27:41,731 --> 00:27:46,731
they send them in.
All I have to do is I'm a little bit of 

459
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:47,270
editing and then posted it online and 
it's not,

460
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:52,580
it's not quite as uh,
is it absorbing as,

461
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,540
as writing a thesis which I wouldn't be 
able to do at this time.

462
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:02,010
So.
So what are the things that I've been 

463
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:02,960
studying and thinking about is high 
achievement in,

464
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,230
among,
among people in general,

465
00:28:05,231 --> 00:28:09,790
and this is also something that I don't 
think is given any serious consideration

466
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:11,770
in our discussion of the differences 
between the,

467
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,870
between the sexes.
So you know,

468
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:18,910
the,
the number of people who are extremely 

469
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:18,910
high achieving in any field is very low.
Right?

470
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,610
And that depends on the per preto 
principle essentially.

471
00:28:21,611 --> 00:28:26,611
And that's that that works itself out 
mathematically so that the square root 

472
00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:28,870
of the number of people in if domain do 
half the work.

473
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,850
So if you have 100 scientists working in
a particular subfield,

474
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,110
then 10 of them will publish half the 
articles.

475
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:39,310
And if you look at that tiny percentage 
of people who were hyper productive,

476
00:28:39,311 --> 00:28:41,180
they're almost all men.
Yeah.

477
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:46,380
So like in universities,
the median number of publications for 

478
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,861
men and women is very close,
but the high publishers are all mad and 

479
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:52,270
the reason for that is because in order 
to be in that category,

480
00:28:52,271 --> 00:28:57,271
not only do you have to be 
extraordinarily smart and 

481
00:28:57,271 --> 00:28:59,731
extraordinarily conscientious,
but associated with that 

482
00:28:59,731 --> 00:29:03,750
conscientiousness,
you have to be able to devote something 

483
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,721
like 60 to 80 hours a week of solid 
attention to your job because otherwise 

484
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:08,980
people will out compete you.

485
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:14,100
Right?
So it's these extremely focused and 

486
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,220
narrow people.
More obsessive.

487
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:20,430
That's exactly right.
They're absolutely obsessed with what 

488
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,540
they're doing and they're quite rare and
that they're also the mystery that needs

489
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:27,541
to be solved because you know the fact 
that most people want to have a balanced

490
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:33,001
life and that most people aren't 
absolutely obsessed with the single 

491
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:36,421
issue to the exclusion of all else is 
actually normally with behavior and 

492
00:29:36,421 --> 00:29:39,901
quite understanding.
You can this extreme a personality,

493
00:29:40,001 --> 00:29:45,001
let's say,
and it's certainly not something that 

494
00:29:45,001 --> 00:29:45,001
I'm criticizing,
but it's not the common law.

495
00:29:45,001 --> 00:29:49,830
And I do believe that it's a far more 
difficult thing for women to manage 

496
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,180
because once you're responsible for 
someone else,

497
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:55,090
like you are primarily responsible for 
small children,

498
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:00,450
then it's extraordinarily difficult to 
concentrate like that to the exclusion 

499
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:02,470
of all else.
And you know,

500
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:06,850
I've seen a couple of women that I've 
had professional relationships with.

501
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:11,850
Usually I usually worked in the capacity
of something like an executive coach in 

502
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:15,970
my clinical practice who kind of manage 
that.

503
00:30:15,971 --> 00:30:19,870
But they're so they're so stretched,
you know,

504
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:20,580
they,
they,

505
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:25,970
they were concerned with the number of 
seconds that they have to microwave 

506
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:25,970
their fruit,
you know,

507
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:30,690
they're hyper,
hyper organized and it's an even then 

508
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,721
it's very difficult for them to manage 
because they're juggling know four or 

509
00:30:33,721 --> 00:30:37,471
five impossible things at the same time 
and often also guilt ridden because 

510
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:42,151
they're not to feel that they're not 
paying enough attention to their 

511
00:30:42,151 --> 00:30:44,821
children.
Generally they are and they make very 

512
00:30:44,821 --> 00:30:47,540
good role models,
but it's a hell of a thing to expect of 

513
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,360
someone who also has a maternal role.
It isn't obvious that it's even that 

514
00:30:52,231 --> 00:30:55,180
it's even possible.
And that's another thing we can't have a

515
00:30:55,181 --> 00:31:00,181
serious conversation about because 
there's all sorts of lies I would say 

516
00:31:00,181 --> 00:31:04,381
about how it's the glass ceiling or were
male models of success that are stopping

517
00:31:06,611 --> 00:31:08,500
women from succeeding at that high 
level.

518
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:10,270
And that isn't right.
What,

519
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:15,510
what stops people from succeeding at 
that high level is it's virtually 

520
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:19,051
impossible to begin with and all you 
need more impediment and then you can't 

521
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:19,390
manage it.

522
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,910
Yeah,
that's right.

523
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:24,990
Can we.
Parlier has said that feminism has never

524
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:30,320
acknowledged the,
the guilt that women feel when they all 

525
00:31:30,991 --> 00:31:35,991
work,
when they have children and they are 

526
00:31:35,991 --> 00:31:36,000
working and they pursue their careers.
And you know,

527
00:31:36,001 --> 00:31:41,001
I,
I've seen it at work places where I've 

528
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:42,840
worked where women are high achieving,
high achieving,

529
00:31:42,841 --> 00:31:47,841
they've got their phds and they're 
working full time and they are racked 

530
00:31:47,841 --> 00:31:52,431
with guilt.
And I don't think that happens to men 

531
00:31:52,431 --> 00:31:54,670
nearly to the same degree.
I

532
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,880
don't think it happens to me really at 
all.

533
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

534
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,540
I mean,
it hasn't been to my observation that it

535
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:03,730
happens to man,
it happens to women all the time,

536
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,570
like all the time.
Like I've,

537
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:10,090
I've done an awful lot of coaching with 
high achieving women.

538
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,790
I did that for about 10 years and you 
know,

539
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:16,720
these were women who were pretty much 
outstanding and in multiple dimensions,

540
00:32:16,721 --> 00:32:17,230
you know,
and,

541
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,700
but,
but what would also,

542
00:32:18,701 --> 00:32:23,701
this was mostly in the field of law and 
so most of them are in their early 

543
00:32:23,701 --> 00:32:27,450
thirties and not only were they racked 
with guilt if they have children and 

544
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,960
we're spending as much time as they 
wanted with them,

545
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:34,220
but they were also wracked with guilt 
when they did spend time with your 

546
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,510
children because then they weren't 
spending enough time on their career and

547
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,020
basically screwed both ways and it.
And it wasn't merely

548
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:44,220
a matter of let's say high negative 
emotional sensitivity,

549
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:49,250
you know,
because that is a biological difference 

550
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,441
between men and women.
Although I would say some of the women 

551
00:32:51,441 --> 00:32:52,470
that I coached were quite feminine and 
we're more prone to anxiety.

552
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:57,471
Then might've been good for them.
But it was merely a response to what's 

553
00:32:57,471 --> 00:33:00,720
essentially an impossible situation and 
like,

554
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,730
and it's also not something that there's
an easy answer to,

555
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:08,810
I mean what I would recommend to them 
was that they outsource all of the 

556
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:12,921
domestic duties they could possibly 
manage and most of the successful women 

557
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:13,110
did that.
They had nannies,

558
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:17,450
they outsourced everything they could,
including their laundry and like they,

559
00:33:17,451 --> 00:33:22,451
they try to rid themselves of any 
domestic duties that could be parceled 

560
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:25,320
out to a third party.
And that's a pretty,

561
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,520
that's necessary.
It's not optional if you want to pursue 

562
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,411
a career at a higher level but also 
requires a pretty high standard of 

563
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:37,161
living to be able to pull that off 
because it's not like childcare of any 

564
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:41,481
quality is extremely expensive and it's 
very difficult to bring that cost down 

565
00:33:41,481 --> 00:33:46,080
because with young children you need a 
very high ratio of caregiver to child,

566
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,030
like three to one,
four to one.

567
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:51,660
So if you have someone who's even 
vaguely qualified and you pay them,

568
00:33:51,661 --> 00:33:53,700
say $40,000
a year,

569
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:56,280
which is pretty low,
double that for overhead.

570
00:33:56,281 --> 00:34:00,200
So that's 80,000.
So just the bare minimum cost of,

571
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,600
of the highest quality of croissant,
institutional care for children is 

572
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,321
easily $20,000
per child per year and there's no easy 

573
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:10,260
way of forcing that costs down.
You can.

574
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,320
The arithmetic is very straightforward.
So it's a major societal problem and it 

575
00:34:16,111 --> 00:34:21,111
isn't clear that at an end,
what's unfortunate is that we're not 

576
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:23,220
having serious conversations about this 
because we pretend that the barriers are

577
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:27,060
what the consequences of something like 
patriarchal oppression or,

578
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,750
or straightforward,
um,

579
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:32,760
prejudice against women.
And that's just simply not the case.

580
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:39,500
The irony is that to make things easier 
for professional middle class 

581
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:44,091
professional women,
you need more working class women who 

582
00:34:44,091 --> 00:34:47,391
can do cleaning and nannying work.
So if you get to,

583
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,260
to make life easier,
you need a,

584
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:56,540
a cohort of lowly paid women,
which I don't think would help the 

585
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,260
gender gap,
if that makes sense.

586
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,680
To have two tiers as well.
That's another highly paid women and 

587
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:03,680
men.

588
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:07,350
That's exactly right.
That's another under discussed,

589
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:11,470
under discussed topic,
which is that you,

590
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:15,030
you ended up transferring the primary,
let's say,

591
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:18,780
maternal burden,
domestic burden onto generally.

592
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:24,020
Well,
they're generally a ethnic minority 

593
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,901
people that's very,
very common and I mean it's not 

594
00:35:26,901 --> 00:35:30,261
necessarily a bad bargain for them.
I'm given their comparative options,

595
00:35:30,571 --> 00:35:35,571
let's say.
But it's very difficult to pay someone 

596
00:35:35,571 --> 00:35:36,900
who's doing domestic work enough so that
they can,

597
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,320
a reasonable standard of living because,
well,

598
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,360
partly because it's just so expensive to
do so.

599
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,960
So it's,
it's an intransigent problem to say the 

600
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,281
least.
And it would be nice if we could 

601
00:35:52,281 --> 00:35:52,770
actually have a serious and 
compassionate discussion about it.

602
00:35:52,771 --> 00:35:55,060
And I think the compassion part,
um,

603
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,990
is to actually take a harsh look at the,
at,

604
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,900
at,
at such factors as the biological clock,

605
00:36:03,901 --> 00:36:08,720
which certainly make women's lives much 
more complicated up until their,

606
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,080
let's say till their forties.
Now.

607
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:16,110
It seems to me that men might have more 
complicated lives in the latter part of 

608
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:19,791
their life because of course we die 
about eight years earlier in our health 

609
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:20,460
problems or are more extreme and all of 
that.

610
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:25,461
But I think that men's situation in life
is somewhat simpler than women,

611
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,250
certainly up to the age of about 40.
And,

612
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:34,630
and it's unfortunate that,
that we can't address that squarely and 

613
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:39,351
start to figure out what to do about it.
Not that it's a simple thing because 

614
00:36:39,351 --> 00:36:39,351
it's certainly not

615
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,460
well,
some places do better than others.

616
00:36:42,461 --> 00:36:47,050
I think in,
I think it's in Holland or the.

617
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:52,350
Yeah.
I think in some of the Scandinavian 

618
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,861
countries there are many women work part
time and that's found to be quite 

619
00:36:57,101 --> 00:37:01,120
productive for their economy and women 
are happy working part time.

620
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,550
So,
um,

621
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:08,170
you know,
I think some societies are a little bit 

622
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,390
more progressive in answering some of 
these questions.

623
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,620
However,
this,

624
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:16,660
there's still this.
I don't know if any Western culture is,

625
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:23,040
has,
has many honest conversations about 

626
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,350
biological sex differences.
I don't,

627
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:28,530
we don't have it in Australia.
It doesn't seem like you have it in 

628
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,231
Canada or America.
I don't know if it happens in the 

629
00:37:31,231 --> 00:37:31,231
Scandinavian countries.

630
00:37:31,231 --> 00:37:33,210
I don't see any evidence that it does.
I mean,

631
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:38,450
the Scandinavians are always concerned 
that there's over representation of men 

632
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,210
in,
in the stem fields,

633
00:37:39,211 --> 00:37:41,040
for example,
especially in engineering,

634
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,520
even though we're thinking that doubt is
pretty clear that the idea that men are 

635
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,121
more interested in things and women are 
more interested in people is pretty 

636
00:37:50,121 --> 00:37:51,630
robust finding and the differences 
aren't small either.

637
00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:53,880
I mean,
and the biological difference,

638
00:37:53,881 --> 00:37:58,881
let her choose be quite,
I think quite productive because 

639
00:37:58,881 --> 00:38:01,941
basically what it's indicated is that 
there doesn't seem to be really much 

640
00:38:01,941 --> 00:38:04,530
difference in men and women with regards
to intellectual ability.

641
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:09,120
The mean Iq is it's pretty much dead on 
exactly the same.

642
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:14,390
Now there is a little debate about 
whether the standard deviation is the 

643
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:17,310
same with some evidence suggesting that 
men have a flatter standard deviation,

644
00:38:17,311 --> 00:38:22,311
so there's more hyper geniuses and 
there's more men who are intellectually 

645
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:27,990
impaired,
certainly more men who were 

646
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,081
intellectually impaired on the learning 
disability end of this distribution for 

647
00:38:30,081 --> 00:38:32,130
example.
But and you know,

648
00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:37,131
even small differences in standard 
deviation can make huge differences out 

649
00:38:37,131 --> 00:38:37,930
at the ends of the table.
So.

650
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,630
But I would say the evidence for that is
mixed.

651
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:45,990
It's not conclusive evidence for 
difference in personality I think is 

652
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:50,251
absolutely conclusive and the evidence 
for difference in interest is even more 

653
00:38:50,251 --> 00:38:52,210
conclusive to the effect.
Sizes are really large

654
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:57,810
and what is really interesting is how 
the sex differences in personality 

655
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:02,611
become larger in ginger,
egalitarian countries.

656
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,200
Yes,
that's scandalous is what that is 

657
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,810
because it's announced disproof of the 
social constructionist theory and it's 

658
00:39:11,031 --> 00:39:16,031
very solid science despite the.
I mean that's some of the material that 

659
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:17,990
changed to more referred to in his memo 
and it's very solid science.

660
00:39:17,991 --> 00:39:19,810
From a social science perspective.
It's.

661
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:25,240
I would say it's at the point where it's
not in controvertible precisely,

662
00:39:25,251 --> 00:39:27,950
but it's about as close as you get in 
the social sciences.

663
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

664
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,150
David Schmidt was the lead author on 
that study,

665
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:38,151
I believe on the finding that 
personality differences increase in 

666
00:39:38,581 --> 00:39:42,690
Gender Galitary in countries and I think
what's.

667
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:47,310
What I find interesting is he's finding 
that women become more neurotic and more

668
00:39:47,311 --> 00:39:50,970
anxious in more free,
you know,

669
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,920
gender egalitarian or or countries that 
have more freedom.

670
00:39:55,010 --> 00:40:00,010
I think that's really interesting in it 
and it speaks to some it.

671
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:06,770
It suggests that there must be some kind
of biological underpinning for anxiety 

672
00:40:08,311 --> 00:40:11,070
in women,
a sex difference in anxiety.

673
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:16,240
Well,
we we should never assume that freedom 

674
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,790
is something that brings security 
because freedom opens unexpensive domain

675
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:23,900
up in front of you and that's full of 
opportunity,

676
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:28,901
but but if we think about that as 
novelty or or the unexpected or 

677
00:40:28,901 --> 00:40:33,371
unexplored territory,
then know your primary response to 

678
00:40:33,371 --> 00:40:35,930
unexplored territory,
especially if the territory is vast,

679
00:40:35,931 --> 00:40:40,931
is initially paralysis and fear and even
in in in the mythology the hero,

680
00:40:42,261 --> 00:40:45,890
which is the archetypal story of the 
confrontation with the unexplored.

681
00:40:45,891 --> 00:40:50,891
It's very,
very common for the hero to take flight 

682
00:40:50,891 --> 00:40:51,290
at the first,
at the first appearance of the,

683
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,670
of the,
let's say,

684
00:40:52,671 --> 00:40:57,671
of the dragon of chaos.
That's good way of thinking about it 

685
00:40:57,671 --> 00:40:58,940
architecturally because that,
that expanse is very.

686
00:40:59,180 --> 00:40:59,900
It's,
it's,

687
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:05,110
it's unsettled in the technical sense 
and that's where the monsters are,

688
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:10,630
and so we should never make the 
assumption that more freedom means more 

689
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:15,491
happiness and know the literature on 
happiness is quite interesting because 

690
00:41:15,491 --> 00:41:17,180
it's actually not a literature on 
happiness.

691
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:22,390
It's a literature on the absence of 
anxiety because it isn't that people 

692
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:27,311
want to be happy,
it's that they don't want to be 

693
00:41:27,311 --> 00:41:29,420
miserable and anxious because those are 
technically separate systems.

694
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:31,520
One governance,
let's say extroversion,

695
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:34,040
that's the approach,
positive system than the other,

696
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,950
uh,
governs.

697
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,340
I'm freezing you pray,
pray like freezing.

698
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:45,341
And then retreat.
It's mostly what we want to do is keep 

699
00:41:45,341 --> 00:41:48,701
the prey like response and the retreat 
systems under control because they're 

700
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,160
unbearable when they're activated and 
so,

701
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:57,310
and there's just no reason at all to 
assume either that freedom or even 

702
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:01,310
economic advantage is associated with 
wellbeing.

703
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:06,700
No,
there's no evidence that people in 

704
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,160
industrialized countries are happier 
than people in non industrialized 

705
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,401
countries,
even though their standard of living is 

706
00:42:12,401 --> 00:42:12,530
much higher and they live much longer 
and they're more disease free.

707
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,920
And I think a big part of the problem is
that it takes a tremendous amount of 

708
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:23,291
sacrifice in work,
it's future oriented in order to keep 

709
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,400
the society with a high standard of 
living functioning.

710
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,400
And so you're constantly sacrificing the
pleasures of the moment to the security 

711
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:32,780
of the future.
And that's a,

712
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:37,930
that's a major moral and emotional load 
even though the reasons for it are 

713
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:44,141
obvious.
But that doesn't simply boil down to 

714
00:42:44,141 --> 00:42:44,450
something like freedom from anxiety or 
happiness,

715
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,420
you know.
And if you have a high pressure job,

716
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,900
well you have a high pressure job,
you have responsibilities and if you 

717
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,100
screw up major things happened with 
major consequences and that's,

718
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,190
that's also a tremendous burden even 
though you can be well paid for it.

719
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:05,360
Like you know,
we studied some,

720
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:10,600
some workers in a factory in Wisconsin 
and we were doing testing that would 

721
00:43:11,451 --> 00:43:16,451
help identify promising workers who 
could be streamed into a management 

722
00:43:16,451 --> 00:43:16,550
role.
And you know,

723
00:43:16,551 --> 00:43:19,550
we found about a third of them didn't 
want to take the tests.

724
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,220
And when we investigated that,
the reason was,

725
00:43:22,221 --> 00:43:26,720
well they wanted to work nine to five in
a bounded manner.

726
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,200
So then they went home at night at 5:00,
they were done their damn job and they 

727
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:37,151
could have their life and you know,
the thing about professional level jobs 

728
00:43:37,151 --> 00:43:38,900
is that complex jobs,
managerial jobs,

729
00:43:38,901 --> 00:43:43,901
complex administrative jobs or jobs in 
science or any of the professions is 

730
00:43:43,901 --> 00:43:45,710
that you're never not working.
Yeah.

731
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,120
So if you add to that the complexity of 
the family,

732
00:43:50,121 --> 00:43:55,121
then you know,
you've got things to worry about that 

733
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:57,851
are significant or the time.
And so if you're also higher insulin 

734
00:43:57,851 --> 00:44:00,790
sensitivity to negative emotion,
that's very stressful and,

735
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:04,880
and genuinely so,
and that's,

736
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:07,910
well that's the price you pay and it's 
not a trivial price.

737
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:14,650
So back to Queensland for a minute,
can you tell me a little bit about its 

738
00:44:15,261 --> 00:44:20,261
reach and scope and about it's 
monetization if you don't have to get 

739
00:44:20,261 --> 00:44:24,911
into the details but people might be 
interested in trying to figure out how 

740
00:44:24,911 --> 00:44:24,911
you manage that.

741
00:44:24,911 --> 00:44:28,360
Okay.
So for the first year that I was running

742
00:44:28,361 --> 00:44:30,790
it,
it was self funded.

743
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:37,100
I wasn't collecting any revenue through 
advertising or patronage.

744
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:38,610
It was just,
um,

745
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:43,080
I funded it myself,
but my costs were very low.

746
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:45,930
It doesn't cost a whole lot to run a 
website.

747
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:48,390
I had minimal infrastructure at the 
time.

748
00:44:48,391 --> 00:44:52,710
I now have a more robust infrastructure 
which costs more.

749
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:57,150
I pay professional freelance writers 
fee,

750
00:44:57,151 --> 00:45:00,840
but academics who work for me because 
they were already salaried,

751
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:01,680
I,
we,

752
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,800
you know,
they did some pro bono writing and that 

753
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:06,990
was fine.
Uh,

754
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:11,580
so for the first year I,
I bootstrapped it in,

755
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:16,581
in,
and I funded it myself and then last 

756
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:21,260
year I set up a patrion page and for a 
while I was um,

757
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:28,100
getting enough,
just enough to cover costs and a little 

758
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:32,091
bit to pay writers.
And then I put advertising on the 

759
00:45:32,091 --> 00:45:35,220
website and I was earning a little,
little bit through that.

760
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:40,550
But the earnings are quite modest and my
patronage has recently been bumped up 

761
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:47,631
because we published quite a popular 
article about the Google memo before 

762
00:45:50,461 --> 00:45:55,461
James was set.
I had reached out to for scientists when

763
00:45:57,121 --> 00:46:00,290
evolutionary psychologist,
Jeffrey Miller lead,

764
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,190
Justin,
the social psychologist,

765
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:07,460
Deborah.
So the Canadian six Rasha and David 

766
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:11,810
Schmidt,
who is the author of that I'm famous 

767
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,520
study and I got them to write a couple 
of paragraphs on what they thought about

768
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:19,521
the Google memo and I've published that 
just as the news broke that he was quiet

769
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:25,820
and so that kind of went viral and site 
crashed.

770
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:30,240
And so we got a lot of attention for 
that in our patronage.

771
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:34,830
Has since doubled for that article was 
published.

772
00:46:34,831 --> 00:46:39,831
We were getting around between 10 and 15
to 20,000

773
00:46:40,861 --> 00:46:42,980
visitors a day,
uh,

774
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:47,290
and now it's between 15 and $30,000
a day.

775
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:52,291
So we get quite a lot of traffic and I 
could be making more money through 

776
00:46:52,291 --> 00:46:52,830
advertising.

777
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:58,100
But the problem with advertising,
you said it slows down the webpage and 

778
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:02,690
there's this trade off between having a 
website that looks nice and is 

779
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:09,380
reasonably fast and one that is just 
loaded with ugly ads any slow and 

780
00:47:11,401 --> 00:47:16,401
clunky.
And so I've decided that I'm just going 

781
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:19,941
to focus on the patronage business model
and get rid of the ads and,

782
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,480
and just focus on pleasing the patrons.
And,

783
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:28,720
and I think patronage is the better 
model to go with anyway because you 

784
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,870
don't have to worry about how many 
clicks or views an article gets.

785
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:36,900
Just have to focus on the quality and 
patrons will reward you for quality,

786
00:47:37,151 --> 00:47:38,630
not for,
you know,

787
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:40,580
how many people.
Yeah,

788
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:41,230
exactly.

789
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:44,550
Yeah.
The other advantage to patronage is that

790
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:48,100
you're a lot more immune from political 
pressure and demonetization,

791
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:54,210
which is increasingly a big deal.
I mean obviously advertisers have the 

792
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:57,571
right to advertise wherever they want,
but certainly on youtube that's become 

793
00:47:57,571 --> 00:48:01,800
an emergent.
There's many problems on youtube 

794
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,100
including censorship from within youtube
itself and the construction of these 

795
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:09,610
like artificial intelligence,
social justice parts that they're 

796
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,961
producing like mad.
But the demonetization issue is a real 

797
00:48:12,971 --> 00:48:17,971
problem for anybody that wants to 
maintain any sort of journalistic 

798
00:48:17,971 --> 00:48:21,031
independence.
And I know lots of people like Dave 

799
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:21,031
Rubin,
for example,

800
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:21,700
the speed hit really hard by 
demonetization.

801
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:25,300
So the patronage model seems to be a 
really.

802
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,210
Seems to be a really good one.
How,

803
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,640
how much revenue are you generating with
patron at the moment,

804
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:31,840
if you don't mind me asking?

805
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,500
Uh,
3000 us a month.

806
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,950
Okay,
so with any luck it'll continue to grow.

807
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:43,990
We'll definitely put a link to the,
to your patron accountant in the 

808
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:45,140
description of this,
of this interview,

809
00:48:45,141 --> 00:48:50,141
and I would certainly encourage people 
who are watching to to support Claire 

810
00:48:50,141 --> 00:48:54,970
Because Colette is really quite a 
remarkable accomplishment and it's 

811
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:57,280
exactly the kind of journalism.
It's reminds me kind of what the 

812
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,551
Atlantic monthly used to be like before 
it took a nosedive into political 

813
00:49:00,551 --> 00:49:03,020
correctness over the last I think about 
five years.

814
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:08,260
It's something that seems to be 
afflicting so many journalistic sources 

815
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,080
or even see it as something that's 
characterizing the economist,

816
00:49:09,081 --> 00:49:14,081
which was a magazine that seemed pretty 
independent of that sort of thing for 

817
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:14,081
quite a while

818
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:18,340
and the new republic used to be at a 
great best unit of classical liberalism 

819
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:25,690
and I'm just defense.
So Western civilization and now it's.

820
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:32,390
It's the most regressive postmodernist.
I mean the new republic is unreadable.

821
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,490
I don't know if you're familiar with 
that magazine.

822
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,120
I'm not as familiar with it as the other
ones that I listed,

823
00:49:41,121 --> 00:49:43,550
but I've noticed the same thing so.
Well,

824
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,040
you know,
the other thing that's interesting,

825
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:52,650
this is part of the reason that I'm so 
concerned with the pathology of the 

826
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:55,490
universities is because it seems to me,
this sounds conspiratorial,

827
00:49:55,491 --> 00:49:59,450
but I'm afraid I'm still going to 
discuss it to the really serious,

828
00:49:59,451 --> 00:50:02,240
postmodern new Marxists.
Disciplines like women's studies,

829
00:50:02,241 --> 00:50:03,260
for example.
They're very,

830
00:50:03,261 --> 00:50:06,530
very good at producing activists who are
very,

831
00:50:06,531 --> 00:50:11,531
very good at occupying mid-level 
bureaucratic positions and dominating 

832
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:14,060
relevant institution.
So for example,

833
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:19,270
one of the things that's happened in in 
the province I live in in Ontario this 

834
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:23,230
month,
is that the Ontario Law Society has now 

835
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:25,841
made it mandatory for lawyers to come 
out with a statement on diversity and 

836
00:50:25,841 --> 00:50:30,431
equity.
So they have to do that part of their 

837
00:50:30,431 --> 00:50:32,501
practice and they basically have to 
admit to white privilege Andy and 

838
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:35,030
systemic racism within the profession.

839
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:38,420
Despite the fact that their own damn 
data indicate,

840
00:50:38,421 --> 00:50:43,421
for example,
that Asians are overrepresented in the 

841
00:50:43,421 --> 00:50:46,091
legal profession.
Which I know that the whole idea is if 

842
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:49,730
you have a theory and then you have a 
data point that invalidates the theory,

843
00:50:49,731 --> 00:50:52,550
that's a reliable data point,
then your theory is wrong.

844
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:58,060
And the fact that the white dominated 
legal profession actually promotes 

845
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:02,681
Asians at a rate that exceeds what you 
would expect by a population and that 

846
00:51:02,681 --> 00:51:05,660
was just absolutely invalidates the idea
of systemic racism,

847
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:11,260
but it doesn't matter because the law 
society's been taken over by a small 

848
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:14,830
coterie of extraordinarily dedicated 
postmodern activists and the,

849
00:51:14,831 --> 00:51:19,831
the amount they care for facts zero 
since they don't even believe in the 

850
00:51:19,831 --> 00:51:20,720
existence of factories.
So

851
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,030
we've had,
we've had the same thing happened to the

852
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:27,180
law society in Australia.
Um,

853
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:31,770
my husband's a lawyer and he brought 
home the Law Society magazine.

854
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:36,980
And on the front cover was an article 
about unconscious bias training and how 

855
00:51:37,591 --> 00:51:42,210
it's going to be mandatory for all 
lawyers in Australia.

856
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:47,930
I sent off a couple of emails to 
psychologists I know who do research in 

857
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:52,041
this area.
And one got back to me saying there is 

858
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:55,650
no data there.
There are no Meta analysis and there are

859
00:51:55,651 --> 00:52:00,651
no randomized controlled trials that 
show that unconscious bias training has 

860
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:06,651
any effect after a couple of hours.
Like it might have an initial effect on 

861
00:52:06,651 --> 00:52:10,770
people when they're doing a pencil and 
paper survey.

862
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:16,160
But after a couple of hours,
that's all gone and there's no long term

863
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:20,250
effect on any measurable outcomes in the
workplace.

864
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,580
So there's no shortcuts.
It's a complete scam.

865
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:24,880
Yeah,
yeah.

866
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:25,660
Stem

867
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,430
and it is based on,
on the,

868
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,810
you know,
the implicit association test of course,

869
00:52:29,811 --> 00:52:34,811
which is being pushed by people who have
a very explicit radical left when you 

870
00:52:34,971 --> 00:52:39,971
gender by the way because measurement,
but now she is known quite well for 

871
00:52:39,971 --> 00:52:41,540
that.
It's been absolutely misused.

872
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:46,570
Like the relationship between so-called 
implicit bias and and categorization 

873
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:51,311
isn't well understood.
We don't understand the relationship 

874
00:52:51,311 --> 00:52:54,521
between implicit bias and the kind of in
group preference that makes you love 

875
00:52:54,521 --> 00:52:55,490
your own family,
for example,

876
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,130
as opposed to,
you know,

877
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,940
equally distributing your care across 
the entire expanse of 7 billion people,

878
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,760
7 billion people that make up the human 
race,

879
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:07,660
which of course you just simply can't do
that.

880
00:53:07,661 --> 00:53:12,200
Behavioral effects of that implicit a s 
a categorization,

881
00:53:12,201 --> 00:53:17,201
let's call it rather than bias,
aren't well understood and there's no 

882
00:53:17,201 --> 00:53:20,321
evidence whatsoever that unconscious 
bias retraining programs do anything 

883
00:53:20,451 --> 00:53:24,430
that's positive whatsoever.
And yet it's being pushed especially and

884
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:29,440
being made mandatory.
It all sorts of levels of corporations 

885
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:29,670
and like,
I can't understand why the lawyers,

886
00:53:29,671 --> 00:53:31,080
for example,
put up with this.

887
00:53:31,081 --> 00:53:33,630
It's like they're being accused.
There'll be,

888
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,360
there'll be accused of guilt before 
innocence,

889
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:41,450
which is all a bunch of racists.
They're being accused in the most 

890
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:42,240
appalling way because they're saying,
well,

891
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:44,010
it's.
It's even unconscious.

892
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:46,860
They're going after the know the,
their targets,

893
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,910
unconscious perceptions,
which is so totalitarian that it.

894
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:55,970
If it isn't even something that the 
bloody associates could have thought 

895
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:55,970
out.

896
00:53:55,970 --> 00:54:00,620
Legal profession as far as I'm aware,
relies on the reasonable person standard

897
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:07,630
and the practitioners.
So lawyers and judges are supposed to be

898
00:54:08,181 --> 00:54:11,810
free of bias.
I mean I,

899
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:14,300
I mean they're not.
If you,

900
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:19,310
if your,
if you are in trouble with the law and 

901
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:22,811
you go to a lawyer,
he's biased toward or she's biased 

902
00:54:22,811 --> 00:54:24,560
towards you,
but if,

903
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:29,650
if you,
if the legal professionals are now 

904
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:32,270
saying that their lawyers are inherently
racist and sexist,

905
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:34,670
I mean that undermines the entire 
profession.

906
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:39,740
Well,
I would also say that that's actually 

907
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:40,590
the reason that this is being done is to
undermine the entire profession.

908
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:45,620
Because the Meta story behind the 
postmodern and Neo Marxist activists is 

909
00:54:46,981 --> 00:54:51,981
that everything about Western 
civilization is corrupt and oppressive 

910
00:54:51,981 --> 00:54:55,161
and should be taken down to.
It's stripped down to its roots and 

911
00:54:55,161 --> 00:54:58,911
rebuilt,
and so the fact that the implicit 

912
00:54:58,911 --> 00:55:01,851
messages,
while you can't trust the legal 

913
00:55:01,851 --> 00:55:03,681
profession,
is no problem for the people who are 

914
00:55:03,681 --> 00:55:03,681
doing that because that's exactly what 
they think.

915
00:55:03,681 --> 00:55:08,000
They think the entire editors of Western
law is nothing but a oppressive 

916
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,871
patriarchal construction,
which is so appallingly backwards that 

917
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,350
it's almost beyond comprehension.
I mean,

918
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:16,020
I suppose compared to their utopians 
you,

919
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:21,230
it's an oppressive structure,
but compared to every other system in 

920
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:21,690
the world,
it operates like a charm.

921
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,390
I think that's.
I think that's the view of the,

922
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,440
the postmodernists and the activist,
but I think that I think there are 

923
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:34,931
sensible people who aren't familiar with
postmodernism that go along with this 

924
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:39,221
stuff and I see corporations and people,
you know,

925
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,260
the legal society is implementing this 
unconscious bias training.

926
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:47,320
I think.
I think a lot of it has to do with 

927
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,900
mitigating the risk of lawsuits and then
if they do get a lawsuit,

928
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:55,540
for example,
if someone wants to see a female 

929
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:58,901
employee,
whether it was to sue them for gender 

930
00:55:58,901 --> 00:55:58,901
discrimination in the workplace,
they can say,

931
00:55:58,901 --> 00:55:59,180
oh,
well we've,

932
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,140
we've had this bias training.
We're trying to do the right thing.

933
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:07,790
For example,
Google have been google,

934
00:56:07,791 --> 00:56:11,090
now I have a class action lawsuit 
against them.

935
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:16,560
Uh,
a handful of female employees are suing 

936
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,981
them for Jenna discriminate.
They're saying that there is systematic 

937
00:56:20,981 --> 00:56:24,551
gender discrimination because they were 
paid less and some male engineers that 

938
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:29,410
were hired at the same time that they 
were and were promoted more quickly.

939
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:33,130
And so I think,
I think a lot of this,

940
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:36,020
these policies are,
uh,

941
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:40,780
companies and corporations just trying 
to cover their backside when it comes to

942
00:56:40,781 --> 00:56:43,120
threaten legal action.

943
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:44,380
No,
no,

944
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:50,310
I think that's right.
I think that's driven than the United 

945
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:51,560
States by legislation like title nine 
because that's held over,

946
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:56,800
especially in educational institutions,
which is primarily applies that's held 

947
00:56:57,531 --> 00:56:59,730
over their heads,
like the sword of Damocles and,

948
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:05,140
and it's been tremendously damaging.
But the problem is for the corporations 

949
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:09,161
is that they're,
they're chasing away a small table and 

950
00:57:09,161 --> 00:57:10,220
letting a way bigger devil in at the 
same time.

951
00:57:10,221 --> 00:57:12,680
And so as a short term solution,
it's,

952
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:17,890
it's somewhat acceptable.
But by participating in these mandatory 

953
00:57:18,051 --> 00:57:21,500
unconscious bias retraining processes,
they do two things.

954
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,690
The first thing they do is admit their 
guilt,

955
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,150
right?
Practically pragmatically speaking,

956
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:31,240
and that's a big mistake.
It's a massive mistake to let someone 

957
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:35,201
accused you of unconscious systematic 
racism and bias and then to allow 

958
00:57:35,271 --> 00:57:38,300
yourself to be retrained because you're 
basically admitting guilt.

959
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:43,510
And I can't see that that's going to put
them on a stronger legal ground moving 

960
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:43,510
forward.

961
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,030
Because by saying what we need this 
training,

962
00:57:47,031 --> 00:57:52,031
you're admitting that the problem exists
at precisely the level that it's being 

963
00:57:52,031 --> 00:57:52,040
diagnosed.
And you know,

964
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:57,041
my experience especially with say with 
large law firms is that they're so 

965
00:57:57,051 --> 00:58:02,051
goddamn desperate for talent that they 
do everything they possibly can say to 

966
00:58:02,051 --> 00:58:06,230
retain their women over backwards and 
tie themselves into knots.

967
00:58:06,231 --> 00:58:08,950
Because if you have a female high 
performing team,

968
00:58:08,951 --> 00:58:13,951
male lawyer who's also capable of 
generating revenue in those people are 

969
00:58:13,951 --> 00:58:14,760
incredibly valuable.
And that,

970
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:20,200
that doesn't mean that there isn't 
conflict between the men and women in 

971
00:58:20,361 --> 00:58:25,361
the law firms at an individual level 
because the other thing that you see 

972
00:58:25,361 --> 00:58:30,011
happening in high achieving professions 
among high achieving people is that 

973
00:58:30,011 --> 00:58:31,130
there were very,
very competitive.

974
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,640
And I've certainly seen like I've had 
many women in my,

975
00:58:34,641 --> 00:58:36,410
uh,
in my coaching practice,

976
00:58:36,411 --> 00:58:41,411
let's say who were under constant stress
from the men in their immediate 

977
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:43,070
environment wouldn't cooperate with 
them.

978
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,400
You know,
and my point always was,

979
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:51,550
look,
it's not surprising that these men 

980
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:51,920
aren't cooperating with you.
You're a threat,

981
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,760
you're very good at what you do.
And they're,

982
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:56,420
they're not only trying to be good 
lawyers,

983
00:58:56,450 --> 00:59:00,890
they're trying to win and you are 
actually doing the winning.

984
00:59:00,891 --> 00:59:04,640
And so they're not going to help you in 
the objection of the women generally who

985
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:06,500
were agreeable.
Women say no.

986
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:08,600
So more on the feminine end of the 
spectrum was,

987
00:59:08,601 --> 00:59:09,920
well,
we're all on the same team,

988
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:11,990
same team.
We should be pulling together.

989
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:13,160
It's like,
well,

990
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:16,070
that isn't exactly how competitive men 
work.

991
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:20,930
Is that partly they're conscientious,
which is the primary characteristic of a

992
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,050
high achieving lawyers as well as high 
verbal intelligence,

993
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,480
but they also tend to be very 
disagreeable,

994
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:31,790
especially if they're litigators and 
obviously they're disagreeable because 

995
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:33,940
they wouldn't be litigators otherwise 
just scribbled.

996
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:36,230
Men are competitive and they want to 
win.

997
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:41,260
And it's another thing that we will talk
about the camp talk about is how in the 

998
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:45,461
world men are supposed to compete with 
women because men don't know how to 

999
00:59:45,461 --> 00:59:47,090
compete with women.
Winning is,

1000
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:52,180
is preferable to losing let's say,
but it also tends to make you into 

1001
00:59:52,701 --> 00:59:57,701
something of a bully.
And that's a big problem in competitive 

1002
00:59:57,701 --> 01:00:01,451
environments because the competition is 
actually part of what drives the 

1003
01:00:01,451 --> 01:00:02,030
productivity.
That's right.

1004
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:05,730
So it's,
it's also on an Nada,

1005
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:07,940
not a straightforward thing to sort out 
at all.

1006
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:13,080
And,
and I don't know exactly what we're 

1007
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:13,080
going to do about that,
but um,

1008
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:16,970
so some of what's regarded as say,
prejudice against women.

1009
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:22,780
Some of that can be nearly attributed to
the fact that men are competitive and 

1010
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:24,230
they,
they treat each other harshly as well.

1011
01:00:24,231 --> 01:00:27,260
It's not as if it's limited to there.
In fact,

1012
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:32,261
I,
I know perfectly well that it's 

1013
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:32,261
essentially mitigated in the case of 
women.

1014
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:35,960
Men are harsher with each other than 
they are with women even though they can

1015
01:00:35,961 --> 01:00:38,940
be perfectly plenty horse with women.
So,

1016
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:44,050
but it's part of the,
it's part of what's accepted as 

1017
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:44,050
normative in,
in,

1018
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:47,040
in primarily male situations show.

1019
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,880
Sure.
And the,

1020
01:00:48,881 --> 01:00:53,881
it's a,
it's a different kind of middling or you

1021
01:00:54,581 --> 01:00:54,870
know,
the,

1022
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:56,550
the,
the casual insults.

1023
01:00:56,551 --> 01:01:01,551
I mean that it's not taken as offensive 
often email only groups.

1024
01:01:01,921 --> 01:01:04,230
It's,
it's almost a way of bonding.

1025
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:04,650
Yeah.

1026
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:11,200
It's also part of the mutual testing 
that goes on because one of the things 

1027
01:01:11,361 --> 01:01:14,570
you want to find out from a new work 
crew member,

1028
01:01:14,571 --> 01:01:17,210
let's say,
and I really saw this when I was working

1029
01:01:17,211 --> 01:01:18,860
in,
in working class situations,

1030
01:01:18,861 --> 01:01:20,780
is you,
you really,

1031
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:22,100
uh,
um,

1032
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,590
harass the hell out of them for a couple
of weeks.

1033
01:01:24,591 --> 01:01:26,300
You know,
put them down,

1034
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,760
give them nicknames,
make fun of them.

1035
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:34,030
And a huge part of the reason you're 
doing that is to see if they have the 

1036
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:37,061
kind of emotional and psychological 
integrity that would indicate that they 

1037
01:01:37,061 --> 01:01:38,150
could take a joke,
they can give a take,

1038
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:41,200
they can stand some competition and that
they're not going to,

1039
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:46,590
they're not going to shirk and they're 
not going to fail in a crisis and men 

1040
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:48,740
are good at doing that with each other 
and it's harder to do that with women.

1041
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,770
It isn't obvious exactly how you should 
do that.

1042
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,470
And I mean it can be managed,
but it's not.

1043
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,650
It's definitely not the same thing.
It's a thing.

1044
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:03,760
And yeah,
I mean I think part of the reason too 

1045
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,121
that men are bailing out of so many 
university disciplines is because they 

1046
01:02:07,121 --> 01:02:10,391
also don't know how to manage the 
environment when it becomes female 

1047
01:02:10,391 --> 01:02:14,501
dominated,
they're not exactly sure what the rules 

1048
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:14,840
of engagement are.
Like I respect my,

1049
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:19,900
my,
my attitude is something like no holds 

1050
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,690
barred and let the devil take the 
hindmost.

1051
01:02:21,691 --> 01:02:23,070
Right.
It's something like that.

1052
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:28,430
And I can be as harsh and blunt and 
straightforward as I want to be in a 

1053
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:32,661
situation like that and then,
but the rules aren't the same when 

1054
01:02:32,661 --> 01:02:34,440
dealing with women and it isn't exactly 
that.

1055
01:02:34,441 --> 01:02:39,441
I know what the rules are,
I just know that they're not the same 

1056
01:02:39,441 --> 01:02:40,620
and that's quite confusing,
you know,

1057
01:02:40,621 --> 01:02:45,621
like my TV appearances,
one of my producers is always cautioned 

1058
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:50,631
me about panels that are mixed sense 
and,

1059
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:55,710
and,
and he said it's very bad for him on 

1060
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:58,400
television to,
to be on the attack in a mixed sex panel

1061
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:00,810
because you come across as a bully.

1062
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:02,180
Yeah.
And,

1063
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:04,240
and,
and,

1064
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:06,280
and fair enough,
I understand that,

1065
01:03:06,281 --> 01:03:09,050
but I also don't know what to do about 
it because it seems like,

1066
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:14,940
like pulling my punches so to speak 
seems like seems necessary but also 

1067
01:03:15,971 --> 01:03:17,950
oddly inappropriate.

1068
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:19,090
Yeah.

1069
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:21,390
It puts me at a loss.
I'm not,

1070
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:23,250
I'm not exactly sure how to manage it.

1071
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:24,810
Yeah.
Well,

1072
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:26,060
you know,
it's one of those,

1073
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:31,490
it's one of the situations where there's
a lot of variation among women and um,

1074
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:32,280
any,
any.

1075
01:03:32,281 --> 01:03:37,281
If you don't know anything more about a 
person other than the fact that they're 

1076
01:03:37,281 --> 01:03:39,260
a woman,
you don't know if they're on the sort of

1077
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:43,520
male typical,
they're more masculine or they're on the

1078
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:45,370
highly agreeable,
you know,

1079
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:46,720
feminine,
you,

1080
01:03:46,721 --> 01:03:48,650
you don't know anything about their 
personality,

1081
01:03:48,651 --> 01:03:51,850
so you don't know if they're going to be
able to handle that given.

1082
01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:55,130
Take.
One thing that I find really interesting

1083
01:03:55,131 --> 01:04:00,131
is that we know,
we know quite a lot about male 

1084
01:04:00,131 --> 01:04:01,370
competition,
but we don't.

1085
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,850
We haven't studied female competition a 
great deal.

1086
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:09,050
I know that some evolutionary 
psychologists have been studying it like

1087
01:04:09,051 --> 01:04:12,140
an capital,
but you know,

1088
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:17,350
women compete with each other as well 
and women have their own forms of 

1089
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:17,350
aggression.
But it's all,

1090
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,530
it's,
it's very.

1091
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:22,690
It's not spoken about much white 
culture.

1092
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,310
Well,
we don't even in the workplace,

1093
01:04:25,311 --> 01:04:28,070
women compete with each other.
And um,

1094
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,600
and,
and I think that's it.

1095
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:30,410
You know,
we're,

1096
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:35,630
you know,
women might come up against hostile or 

1097
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:36,560
hyper competitive men,
but women come up against other women as

1098
01:04:36,561 --> 01:04:37,210
well.
And,

1099
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:42,830
and it could be the case that a younger 
women and not what one speculation or 

1100
01:04:46,071 --> 01:04:51,071
hypothesis that I've had is that younger
women don't always find it easier to 

1101
01:04:52,101 --> 01:04:56,750
work with older women because there is 
competition there and hostility.

1102
01:04:56,751 --> 01:04:56,910
No,

1103
01:04:56,950 --> 01:05:01,950
there is evidence that women are happier
with male bosses than with female 

1104
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:03,970
bosses.
And your,

1105
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:09,120
your observation about us not 
understanding the competitive landscape 

1106
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:13,081
is spot on.
We don't understand the male dominance 

1107
01:05:13,081 --> 01:05:16,021
hierarchies very well because females,
females in the workplace or in a female 

1108
01:05:16,021 --> 01:05:19,330
dominant Turkey and the male hierarchy 
and the rules are not the same.

1109
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,850
And there's certainly,
there's a,

1110
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:26,880
there's a kind of sexual attractiveness 
tension between older women and younger 

1111
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:26,880
women.
That's,

1112
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,530
that,
that doesn't play the same way with men 

1113
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:34,610
and and it,
it puts a strange dynamic into the 

1114
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:35,230
workplace and it's certainly by no means
evidence,

1115
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:40,290
evidence self evident that women are 
women's best friends in the workplace 

1116
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:44,881
either.
So these are all things that we don't 

1117
01:05:44,881 --> 01:05:45,190
understand well and are afraid to 
address.

1118
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:50,191
And I'm very curious about the female 
dominance hierarchy because it's not 

1119
01:05:50,191 --> 01:05:52,510
predicated on the same presumptions as 
the male dominance hurricane.

1120
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:57,750
I had a friend of mine who's a very,
a very insightful person and he was 

1121
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:58,160
talking about,
um,

1122
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:02,230
the mode of dress that's characteristic 
of repressive Islam,

1123
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:07,260
you know,
and one of his hypothesis was that it 

1124
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:09,841
was a way that the older women exercise 
control over the sexual attractiveness 

1125
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:13,831
of the younger women.
And then it's actually not primarily a 

1126
01:06:13,831 --> 01:06:15,370
phenomena that's associated with male 
dominance of women at all.

1127
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:20,650
I think that's a really interesting 
hypothesis and highly credible because 

1128
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:22,870
young women have a tremendous amount of 
sexual power and,

1129
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,150
and that needs to be,
well,

1130
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:28,000
that's a,
let's call it a complicating factor.

1131
01:06:28,001 --> 01:06:30,610
We could at least get along.
We can at least get away with that.

1132
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:35,611
It's a massively complicating factor and
we also don't know the degree to which 

1133
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,830
women use sexual attractiveness in the 
workplace as a,

1134
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:41,560
as a motive,
achieving dominance and power.

1135
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:43,720
And you know,
one of the things I've thought about for

1136
01:06:43,721 --> 01:06:44,440
example,
is,

1137
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:49,880
um,
and I'm not suggesting that this is 

1138
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:49,880
something that should be done,
but you know,

1139
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:54,050
truly a Gal,
a society that was truly aiming at 

1140
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:55,750
removing sex bias from the workplace 
might ban makeup.

1141
01:06:57,730 --> 01:07:00,590
Because it's not,
it's not self evident to me that that's,

1142
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,000
that's appropriate from a,
from a technical perspective in the 

1143
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,171
workplace because it mixes sexual 
attractiveness with functionality in a 

1144
01:07:10,171 --> 01:07:10,900
way that,
well,

1145
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:15,370
in a way that at least is complex now.
I wouldn't ever say that we should go so

1146
01:07:15,371 --> 01:07:19,480
far as to ban makeup in the workplace,
but there's a point to be made there,

1147
01:07:19,481 --> 01:07:24,481
which is that we haven't separated out 
the politics from the sexual politics 

1148
01:07:24,481 --> 01:07:25,600
and that's a major,
major problem.

1149
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:26,500
And,
and,

1150
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:30,070
and partly because we can't have real 
discussions about it.

1151
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:33,440
Generally speaking,
it's something that stays unaddressed.

1152
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:37,420
And so,
so I'm going to stop,

1153
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:38,530
I think.
Yes.

1154
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:44,600
Uh,
I'm very happy that you agreed to talk 

1155
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:44,600
with me today.
I'm,

1156
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:49,220
I'm a great admirer of your website.
I think Colette has done a remarkable 

1157
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:50,320
job.
I hope we get a chance to talk again.

1158
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:54,460
I'm certainly going to encourage all the
people who are watching and listening to

1159
01:07:54,790 --> 01:07:59,790
contribute to your patron account 
because I really believed that support 

1160
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:01,300
for that is going to be in everyone's 
best interest,

1161
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,490
let's put it that way.
And so,

1162
01:08:03,491 --> 01:08:08,491
um,
thanks very much for the conversation 

1163
01:08:08,491 --> 01:08:11,101
and I hope that we get a chance to talk 
again in the relatively near future and 

1164
01:08:11,101 --> 01:08:11,560
I'll let you know when this is up and 
all of that.

1165
01:08:11,561 --> 01:08:13,490
Okay.
Right.

1166
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:16,750
Thanks.
Nice talking to you.

1167
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:18,290
Alright.
