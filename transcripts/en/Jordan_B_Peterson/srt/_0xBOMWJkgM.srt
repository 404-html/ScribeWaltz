00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,793
Hello,
welcome to psychology to 30 personality 

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,143
and its transformations.
It's called that because there are two 

3
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,613
things that you have to take into 
account when you're thinking about 

4
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:21,724
personality and one of those is
how personality stays the same across 

5
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:28,234
time and that's really what gives you 
your identity and what allows you to 

6
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,550
identify other people and then also help
personality changes.

7
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,800
We're going to

8
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,570
discuss both those things from a very 
large number of perspectives

9
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,560
to find out all the information that you
need for the course.

10
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,580
All you have to do is type my name into 
a browser and you'll get my home page,

11
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:02,460
which is the page that you see here on 
the left.

12
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,980
There's a table of contents that says 
current course,

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,640
and then up here there's also a table of
contents that lists the courses and this

14
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:11,634
one's this one,
and then this is the introductory page 

15
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:16,344
here,
and then you can get to the course page 

16
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:20,160
like this.
I don't really like blackboard,

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,020
so I'm going to use this instead.
So this is easy to get to and everything

18
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:27,090
you need to know about the core should 
be here.

19
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,370
So we'll start with the very 
straightforward things.

20
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,373
The first is there's,
there's two sources for reading in this 

21
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:38,874
course and one is a paperback book,
which is called introduction to 

22
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:44,454
personality and its transformations.
They're both chapters that I selected 

23
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:54,801
from Classic Personality Textbook that 
does a very good job of covering

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,800
classic personality theorists,
although not such a good job of covering

25
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:06,000
more recent work.
The book was published in 1982.

26
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,223
Freud hasn't changed much since 1982,
but there has been an awful lot of 

27
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:16,180
personality research and so that brings 
us to the second source of readings.

28
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:19,380
And the second source of readings is 
actually this webpage.

29
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,160
So if you go down the webpage to lecture
topics and readings,

30
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,180
you'll see in the third column a whole 
sequence of papers.

31
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,003
Now you have to pay attention to this 
lectures and reading table more than 

32
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:36,240
anything else because it tells you 
what's going on for the for the duration

33
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:39,330
of the course and tell you what the 
lectures are.

34
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:40,590
So today,
for example,

35
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:41,424
it's January seventh,
and so we're doing an introduction and 

36
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:45,810
overview.
Maybe I could make that a little bigger

37
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,490
and next week,
no on,

38
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,593
on a Thursday we start with this reading
is called free forms of meaning in the 

39
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,500
management of complexity and all you 
have to use to get that reading is click

40
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:06,334
on it and then you get that reading,
which is a fairly straightforward 

41
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,650
process.
Um,

42
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,863
you would probably like the lectures 
better if you do the readings 

43
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:16,924
beforehand.

44
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,770
Um,
that's,

45
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,730
it isn't necessary.
You can do this anyway you want,

46
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,820
but you'll get more out of the course I 
think if you do that.

47
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:27,903
Um,

48
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,630
there's two Ta's for this course.
There are also listed here.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,880
One is Vanessa Gauche and the other is 
victor swift.

50
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,773
Their availability is listed here.
So Vanessa is available from 4:45 to 

51
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:50,081
5:45 on Thursdays and victor is,
is available from 3:15 to 4:50 tuesdays.

52
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,213
Their office offices are listed there as
are their email addresses so that you 

53
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:56,864
can get in touch with them.
My office hours are Wednesday from 4:15 

54
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,160
to 5:45.
Now,

55
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,680
the way I handled that is outside my 
office,

56
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:09,980
which is office four zero four six,
which is also listed there.

57
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,490
There are a number of signup sheets that
I'm just going to post on the wall.

58
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:15,800
Do that right after class because 
they're printed out,

59
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,100
there's a number of signup sheets that 
are listed on the wall and your best bet

60
00:04:21,771 --> 00:04:24,690
is just to take a 15 minute slot.
Um,

61
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,113
don't take a whole bunch of them because
the student to teacher ratio in this 

62
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,644
class is obviously quite high.
And so just take one for now if you 

63
00:04:34,131 --> 00:04:34,964
would,
and maybe if you have a meeting with me 

64
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,070
you can check back later to see if 
there's time for another one.

65
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,100
Um,
I would like to have more time than that

66
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,203
available,
but 90 minutes is what I can spare this 

67
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:50,090
semester.
So anyways,

68
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,290
there'll be up today.

69
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,120
Now,
in terms of the mechanics of the course,

70
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,510
it's pretty straightforward.
There's no tricks.

71
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,240
Um,
there's two midterms.

72
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,530
The first one is February sixth and the 
second one

73
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,343
is March 13th and there's also a final 
and the midterm and the final is 

74
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,120
essentially make up 75 percent of the 
course.

75
00:05:17,121 --> 00:05:20,000
It's actually 77 point five percent of 
the course,

76
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:24,080
but
then there's two writing assignments.

77
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,693
The first writing assignment is an essay
and the essay has a number of different 

78
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:31,514
due dates,
so if you're on the website you can go 

79
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:34,094
to writing assignments and then you'll 
see all these different topics that you 

80
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:41,600
can choose from.
Now if you click on one of these,

81
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,843
you get to this little sign up sheet 
here and then you can put in your name 

82
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:48,074
and your email address and that signs 
you up for that topic and as you can 

83
00:05:53,631 --> 00:05:55,790
see,
10 people can sign up for each topic.

84
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:56,624
So if you're in with a particular topic,
then you should sign up sooner rather 

85
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,124
than later.
The due dates fall a little after the 

86
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,250
course content that's related to that 
topic,

87
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:15,660
so it will be the next class after the 
lectures on that topic and dark,

88
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,700
spread them out across the year so that 
the Ta's don't die,

89
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:20,534
a frustration and so that you guys can 
get your essays back with a reasonable 

90
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:27,920
degree of promptness.
Hopefully within a week.

91
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,220
Although let's say two weeks,
which seems reasonable.

92
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,403
So

93
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,590
the second
writing exercise,

94
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,810
which is worth seven point five percent,
BSA is worth 15 percent,

95
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,453
is a personality self analysis.
It's part of a suite of programs that I 

96
00:06:52,571 --> 00:06:57,430
designed called the cell fourth ring.
Sweet and I can show you those

97
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,093
and it's a cell phone ring.com
and I'll show you this video at some 

98
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:15,330
point,
but for now

99
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,170
there's information here on these 
programs,

100
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:24,090
but I'll give you a username and 
password so then you can complete these.

101
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,133
And what you'll be asked to do is to 
complete an exercise that's based on a 

102
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,110
big five model of adjective description 
of personality.

103
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:34,944
So since about 1930,
statisticians have been studying the 

104
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:41,214
structure of language at a sentence 
level and add an adjective level to 

105
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:46,794
determine what the underlying 
correlational structure of descriptive 

106
00:07:51,001 --> 00:07:55,290
phrases as they apply to human beings.
So for example,

107
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,333
if you're happy,
you're talkative and that might be 

108
00:07:59,761 --> 00:08:00,594
surprising,
but the fact that those two things are 

109
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:03,564
tightly connected was one of the things 
that was discovered by the factor 

110
00:08:06,631 --> 00:08:07,464
analytic processes that lead to the 
development of the big five and the big 

111
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,153
five.
They're roughly five traits as the name 

112
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:14,754
might indicate extroversion,
which is a positive emotion trade 

113
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,080
neuroticism,
which is a negative emotion trait.

114
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,740
Agreeableness,
which is warmth and empathy,

115
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,783
compassion.
Maybe the other side of that is kind of 

116
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:32,070
a harsh coldness,
I guess.

117
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,333
Um,
openness which is both intelligence and 

118
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:37,854
creativity and conscientiousness,
which is industriousness and 

119
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:44,670
orderliness.
Now there are virtues,

120
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,810
so to speak and faults associated with 
all of those dimensions.

121
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,410
So you can be too extroverted,
which makes you rather impulsive.

122
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:53,244
And if you're very extroverted,
it's more difficult to good grades and 

123
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:56,514
university because you're always out 
having fun with your friends and 

124
00:08:58,351 --> 00:08:59,184
partying.
And that might be good in that it will 

125
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:03,840
help you develop a fairly extensive 
social network,

126
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:04,674
which is a useful thing if you're 
associated with people who are useful 

127
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:09,940
for social networking purposes,
um,

128
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,793
but it can really interfere with your 
ability to sit by yourself and study if 

129
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:15,264
you're conscientious,
that's a good predictor of academic 

130
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:18,804
success because conscientious people do 
what they say they're going to do and 

131
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,314
they seem to suffer shame and self 
disgust and self contempt and guilt and 

132
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:29,010
so on.

133
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,460
If they don't,
um,

134
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,800
if you get too conscientious though,
you can get quite

135
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,810
boxed in and,
and orderly and narrow in orderliness by

136
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:42,520
the way seems to be associated with a 
railing,

137
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,370
political views.
And when it's extreme,

138
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:45,900
it's,
it starts to get repressive.

139
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,123
And so the point of all this is that 
there are five traits and they have 

140
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:53,820
positive and negative aspects,
especially at the extremes.

141
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,850
And these programs are set up,
first of all,

142
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,893
so that you'll see a series of 
adjectives that are universal 

143
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:01,584
descriptor.
So it's basically a small set of 

144
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:06,390
adjectives,
100 that kind of cover each dimension of

145
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:09,630
personality with a reasonable degree of 
comprehensiveness.

146
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:10,464
Then you'll be asked to pick which ones 
you think are particularly relevant to 

147
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:15,024
you and then you'll be asked to narrow 
that to a final list in one half of the 

148
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:20,574
exercise I'll list that represents your 
virtues and then in the other half of 

149
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:26,940
the exercise a list that represents your
fault.

150
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,013
Then you'll be asked to describe a time 
when not virtue played a positive role 

151
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:33,624
for you or when that fault interfered 
with you and then you'll be asked to 

152
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,263
describe how you might capitalize on 
that virtue in the future or perhaps 

153
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,390
Britain that fall under control in the 
future.

154
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,680
And it turns out that writing exercises 
of this sort,

155
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:55,170
I'm are very practically useful.
They have a variety of positive effects.

156
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,240
One of which seems to be an increase in 
academic performance.

157
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,263
And our research so far has indicated 
that that increase can be quite 

158
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:11,730
substantial.
Among with similar programs.

159
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,683
At Mcgill we raised the academic 
performance of struggling university 

160
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:17,964
students by 25 percent.
So whole grade point and at a business 

161
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:25,920
school in Holland where this is being 
studied in some depth,

162
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:26,754
we've studied 2000 people,
they actually did the future authoring 

163
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:32,460
program but not the present authoring 
program,

164
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:33,294
which is the one you're going to do and 
we improve their overall academic 

165
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:38,880
achievement by about 30 percent as well.

166
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,033
Turns out that articulating yourself is 
an extraordinarily useful thing to do 

167
00:11:45,911 --> 00:11:46,744
and you could actually.
You could also think about that in a 

168
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:51,114
more comprehensive way
as the goal of safe psychotherapy and 

169
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,803
personality transformation.
A lot of what's happening as you mature 

170
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,230
and develop as a personality is that 
what you are,

171
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:03,064
whatever that means.
I guess it's your behaviors and your 

172
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:09,160
potential and I don't know exactly what 
the potential is,

173
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:09,994
but your behaviors and your potential 
can be increasingly organized at a high 

174
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:17,620
level of consciousness articulated at a 
high level of conscious.

175
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:18,454
There's an articulation is a funny word,
a because partly it means joint 

176
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:22,900
articulation.
No,

177
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,753
your hands are very articulated and 
that's why you can do a lot of things 

178
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:29,410
with them and hands and speech are very 
tightly related,

179
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,513
which is why most people,
speech centers are in the same 

180
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,870
hemisphere as their dominant hand.

181
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,073
Anyways.
Articulating yourself makes you able to 

182
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:39,184
do many more things with yourself and it
also seems to quell your negative 

183
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:45,270
emotion,
partly because it's clarifying you.

184
00:12:45,271 --> 00:12:48,400
You know the more you leave things muddy
in your life,

185
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,263
the less defined things are around you.
The more active your stress response 

186
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:55,870
systems are because if things are murky 
and undefined,

187
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,710
your stress systems basically assumed 
that there are alligators and snakes and

188
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:00,783
predators hiding all that fog and gloom 
and that you're in a very dangerous 

189
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,313
environment.
But if you clarify that with careful 

190
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:11,020
attention and articulation,
you can clear away the fog and the gloom

191
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,063
and that only leaves you with your 
actual problems which once defined 

192
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,730
carefully you might find manageable and 
an example that would be.

193
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,193
You know when you go into your room and 
you haven't done your homework for 

194
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:27,010
awhile and there's piles of papers 
piling up or maybe there's piles of junk

195
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:30,250
on your computer,
it doesn't really matter and you'll have

196
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:34,120
a very powerful tendency to avoid that,
not even to look at it,

197
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:34,300
right?

198
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,300
You don't even want to look at it 
because it's and that's chaos.

199
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:38,134
It's sort of growing in your environment
and there's a specific part of your 

200
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:42,064
brain which evolved to detect snakes 
that deals with such little chaotic 

201
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:46,534
piles of undone business and the more of
those that are around you 

202
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,913
psychologically or physically,
the more negative emotions you 

203
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:54,514
experienced,
the last hope you experienced and the 

204
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:57,963
larger your stress response chronically,
and that's not good because if your 

205
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,373
stress response is chronically elevated,
that suppresses your immune logical 

206
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:07,990
function.
It makes you overweight,

207
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,950
predisposes you to diabetes and cancer.
It makes you age faster.

208
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,670
It increases the probability that you'll
have anxiety disorders and depression.

209
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,880
It's a bad thing,
so,

210
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,130
so clarifying who you are and what 
you're doing is a good thing.

211
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:26,110
Unless you want all those other things 
to happen,

212
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:31,111
which seems highly improbable,
although people desire some very strange

213
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:36,391
things and that's part of what we'll 
talk about as this course progresses.

214
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,223
Okay,
so if you want to find out about the 

215
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:44,470
course,
you can go to Jordan b Peterson Dotcom,

216
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,023
and the courses are listed there.
You just type my name into a search 

217
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:51,860
engine and you'll find the courses.
This course is psych two to 30.

218
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,220
Obviously I mentioned if there's a 
reading book,

219
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:58,130
would you have to buy the rest of the 
readings are online,

220
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,060
the order that you do that reading is 
listed on the syllabus.

221
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,170
You also have to do two assignments and 
the essay,

222
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,093
which is only 750 words by the way,
but don't let that fool you because the 

223
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:12,800
750 word essay can be very difficult to 
write

224
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,520
the essay and then this personality 
analysis.

225
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:17,354
Now the personality analysis,
all you have to do is show it to the Ta 

226
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:22,963
to show them that you completed it 
because we don't want to know what you 

227
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:26,144
wrote down and we want to encourage you 
to write down things that you know that 

228
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,970
you'd like to write down that are likely
private,

229
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,430
unless you want to broadcast to your 
faults on facebook,

230
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:37,490
which I suppose you knew after you 
complete the exercise.

231
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,820
So the reason I want you to do that,
well,

232
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:41,840
there's three weeks.
That's right.

233
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,703
One is well,
it will familiarize you more with 

234
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:45,704
standard models of personality because 
you have to apply them to yourself and 

235
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,030
so then you'll understand yourself 
better too.

236
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:50,864
So that's a good thing.
And then it's also a clinical 

237
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:57,380
intervention and some of you,
because you're in this course,

238
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,303
are no doubt interested in clinical 
psychology and so this will give you a 

239
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:01,274
flavor of the sorts of things that a 
clinical psychologist might do except a 

240
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:08,870
computer is doing it and then which,
which turns out to be fine.

241
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:13,070
People will actually often tell 
computers things that they wouldn't tell

242
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:16,340
people because the computer doesn't care
what you've done particularly,

243
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,950
not yet anyways.
And uh,

244
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,510
the third reason is that while it should
be good for you and you know,

245
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,310
education should be good for you.

246
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,560
That's actually the purpose of 
education,

247
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,473
right?
It's supposed to make you more healthy 

248
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:31,004
mentally and physically.
It's supposed to make you more 

249
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:33,464
productive.
And so that's what education is for and 

250
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:39,260
that's what this class is for.
So that's what we're aiming at.

251
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:43,160
So then there's two exams,
two midterms,

252
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,610
25 percent each.
Approximately there are multiple choice.

253
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,003
Um,
I'll post sample questions so that 

254
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:53,810
you'll know what they're like.
They're not tricky.

255
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,630
People get worried about exams and 
rightly so,

256
00:16:56,631 --> 00:16:57,464
but these aren't tricky dance.
If you do the readings and you come to 

257
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:01,940
the class,
the probabilities quite high that you'll

258
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:05,130
do at least reasonably well.
Um,

259
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,210
I don't ask you to memorize dates and 
that sort of thing.

260
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:09,044
I try to keep it at a conceptual level.
And so the questions on the multiple 

261
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:16,310
choice tests are usually conceptual 
questions where I try to get you to take

262
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:17,144
something that you've learned to read 
and to apply it to the solving of a 

263
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:21,950
problem,
even though they're in standard multiple

264
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:23,450
choice format,
there's,

265
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,240
there's usually not a tremendous number 
of questions.

266
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:31,241
So you'll be able to complete the exams 
in the time allowed without any trouble.

267
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,880
So
now let's see.

268
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,803
I should tell you guys who should take 
this course and who shouldn't take it 

269
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,140
because you need to know that since it's
your first day.

270
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:47,141
And so this course has two or three 
aspects.

271
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,770
One aspect is scientific that really 
occupies the last half of the course,

272
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:57,090
I would say it in the pre scientific 
part of the course

273
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,120
with a purely research oriented element 
of the course.

274
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,080
The first part of scientific too,
because science has more science,

275
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,000
more than mere testing of hypotheses.
Anyways,

276
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,133
the second half of the course deals 
essentially with trait theory with 

277
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,703
psychobiology.
So what I want to do is to tell you 

278
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:17,634
about the basic dimensions of human 
variability and also how those are 

279
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:24,683
represented in the brain.
So that you can make a connection and 

280
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,463
the body so that you can make a 
connection between the theories and the 

281
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,660
biological cognitive subscripts and not 
sort of a unifying attempt.

282
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:37,494
So you bought to be interested,
not if you want to take this course and 

283
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,410
you know,
and how did it go well for you.

284
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,573
So there's some psychometrics that's the
science of measurement because a little 

285
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:48,384
bit of statistics,
here's a reasonable amount of 

286
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,760
neuropsychology and some of it's 
complex,

287
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,790
some of it isn't,
but I try to only pick things that I try

288
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,223
to only pick things to discuss with you 
that are relevant at three levels of 

289
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:07,590
analysis.
I want them to be personally relevant so

290
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:09,330
that they tell you something about 
yourself.

291
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,000
I want them to be intellectually 
relevant,

292
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,550
but I also want them to be culturally 
relevant so that not all.

293
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,900
When you walk away from the study,
not only have,

294
00:19:17,901 --> 00:19:19,980
you know something more about you and 
your friends,

295
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:20,814
but hopefully you're a better 
functioning creature in the broader 

296
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:24,240
social meal.
You.

297
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,640
So,
so everything is picked to that end,

298
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,493
including the psychobiological or 
neuropsychological material and the 

299
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,690
trait material.
There's a fairly heavy,

300
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,290
heavy emphasis on

301
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,203
clinical issues.
The first half of the course deals with 

302
00:19:43,571 --> 00:19:44,404
classic theorists have personality and 
all the classic personality theorists 

303
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:50,740
were clinicians.
Now the UFT at present,

304
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:51,883
it doesn't have a clinical program,
although they're starting to get up in 

305
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:56,260
scarborough,
but down here at St George,

306
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:59,230
there's not many clinicians.
I think I'm probably the only one.

307
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:04,380
I don't know why they let me in,
but we did and the thing,

308
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,780
the emphasis on that,
the emphasis of clinicians,

309
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:08,800
it's twofold,
right?

310
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:09,634
One is,
well who is the person or what is the 

311
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,480
person,
but more importantly,

312
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,620
who could the person be or what should 
they be?

313
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:19,930
And that's a very strange thing about 
people,

314
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,580
right?
I mean if you have a cat,

315
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:25,060
you don't really sit around thinking 
what could this cap b?

316
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,340
Because it's a captain,
you know,

317
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,263
if it has offspring,
there going to be cats and in the past 

318
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,320
years there's still going to be just 
cats.

319
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,960
But people.
Well,

320
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:40,020
we're strange in ways that are virtually
incomprehensible and we're not only what

321
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,433
we are,
but we're also what we could be and in 

322
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:46,540
many cases,
especially for people of your age,

323
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,340
you're way more what you could be than 
what you are and so focusing on what you

324
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:54,340
could be,
is it an extremely important thing to do

325
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:55,174
and in fact there's.
There's plenty of research and some of 

326
00:20:57,011 --> 00:21:01,540
it's associated with the writing 
exercises that I told you about earlier,

327
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,523
that if you make efforts to define who 
you could be and you know in a way that 

328
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:07,894
you find interesting because he might as
well shape yourself into something that 

329
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,104
you want to be,
that that increases the efficiency with 

330
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,944
which you work substantially.
It also makes you a better person by 

331
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:21,310
reasonable measures of better sort of 
needs,

332
00:21:21,311 --> 00:21:25,990
happier and healthier and more 
acceptable or at least less repulsive to

333
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:26,824
other people.

334
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:28,683
So the clinical materials very useful 
for that and the clinical material is 

335
00:21:33,581 --> 00:21:37,000
grounded in observation.
So it's kind of like ethos elegy.

336
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,460
He thought Ology is the study of animal 
behavior,

337
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:41,670
but no one in the lab.
It's observational study,

338
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:45,640
a lot of the clinical stuff has this 
observational quality to it.

339
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:50,470
It's heavily influenced by philosophy.
If you're not interested in ideas,

340
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,120
this is a bad course for you because 
it's,

341
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,073
it's,
it's a course that private equity 

342
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,373
concentrates on ideas.
I want them to have practical utility 

343
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:00,910
because why not?
You want us?

344
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:02,230
We'll put constraints on them,
but,

345
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:03,743
but the fundamental focus is ideas.
And so when we discuss the clinical 

346
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:11,170
material,
clinical personality material,

347
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,380
we'll discuss the philosophical 
background of that and we'll do the same

348
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:17,290
thing when we get to the 
psychobiological material.

349
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,303
So you want to decide if you're not 
interested in philosophical ideas that 

350
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,750
this is a bad course because you're 
going to be stuck with,

351
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,000
with those sorts of things half the 
time.

352
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,433
So.

353
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,600
And there's some,
there's some elements of the course.

354
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:37,890
They're almost straight philosophy 
because some of the clinical schools,

355
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,360
especially those that were developed in 
19 fifties,

356
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,093
like existential psychology are very 
tightly associated with fields of 

357
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,450
philosophy,
existentialism and phenomenology in that

358
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,290
case.
And so,

359
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,423
um,
I think that sort of thing is very much 

360
00:22:53,321 --> 00:22:54,154
worth learning because it's part of the 
history of ideas and you should also 

361
00:22:57,011 --> 00:22:59,830
think about it and it's also very 
interesting.

362
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,933
It's very useful to know something about
if you're going to be a clinical 

363
00:23:02,621 --> 00:23:04,670
psychologist,
because you should know a fair bit about

364
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,000
a lot of things if you're going to be a 
clinical psychologist.

365
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:10,730
But even if you're interested in 
research sciences,

366
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,583
have high hypothesis testing.
But the other half is I bought this 

367
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,190
generation that's the most important.
After.

368
00:23:17,191 --> 00:23:19,720
You've got to think up an idea before 
you can test it.

369
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:20,943
And you know,
most of what you'll learn in methods 

370
00:23:22,241 --> 00:23:25,270
class has nothing to do with gender 
research hypotheses.

371
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,140
They just tell you to do that first,
generate your research hypotheses.

372
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,700
It's like,
yeah,

373
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:34,390
that's the big problem right there.
The resident is just machinery,

374
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,253
right?
We'll just grind it through this 

375
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,023
process.
And the way you generate research 

376
00:23:39,491 --> 00:23:40,324
hypothesis is by knowing something.
And so you have to learn a lot in order 

377
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:47,330
to generate a research hypothesis that,
well first,

378
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:51,980
if someone hasn't already else hasn't 
already thought of and disproved,

379
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,740
which is highly probable.
It's actually depressing.

380
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,500
Yeah.
But more and more knowledge because what

381
00:23:57,501 --> 00:24:00,230
you find is that everyone's already 
thought of everything.

382
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,410
And what was your ideas are stupid.
So

383
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,920
yeah.
So

384
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,320
anyways,
now let's see.

385
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,243
Oh yes.
Here's another reason not to take the 

386
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:15,344
course.
There's a lot of reading and there's 

387
00:24:19,101 --> 00:24:24,020
less reading either was last year I took
out one paper that was too hard.

388
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:29,021
I think it was too hard for people even 
though it was a great paper and left the

389
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,670
rest of the data.
And so

390
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,993
yeah,
if you're looking for a course with a 

391
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:35,974
light reading load,
this isn't that course because this has 

392
00:24:38,771 --> 00:24:42,400
a heavy reading load now on the upside 
for your essays,

393
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:44,800
I don't require you to read outside of 
the course.

394
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:47,590
You can use the material that's in the 
course to write the essay.

395
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,260
So it's self contained.
What?

396
00:24:50,261 --> 00:24:55,261
There's a lot of reading and it's not 
easy reading and partly because a lot of

397
00:24:56,591 --> 00:24:57,424
it is original papers.
All the stuff that's listed on the web 

398
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,790
is original papers and then the textbook
too.

399
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:06,040
It's tough textbook.
It's mostly text,

400
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,163
doesn't have a lot of pictures.
It has no stories at all about 

401
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:12,720
celebrities.
I think that's the only text left.

402
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,150
Doesn't have stories about celebrities,
so

403
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,460
if you're.
If you're taking a tough course semester

404
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,950
and you don't have a lot of time to 
read,

405
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:29,550
then well this isn't a course like that.
It's a course where there's an awful lot

406
00:25:30,851 --> 00:25:34,840
to read and the thing about the reading 
too is that you have to think about it.

407
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,183
You know like how fast you can read 
something seems to be a function of how 

408
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,770
complicated the words are.
That would be function one,

409
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,753
but the second function seems to be 
something like how many ideas and there 

410
00:25:48,491 --> 00:25:53,491
are per paragraph or maybe per paid.
There are lots of ideas per paragraph in

411
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,630
these readings.
That's why I picked them.

412
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,020
So you can't just zip through them.
You have to think about,

413
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,020
well that's a good thing.
If you do read them,

414
00:26:02,021 --> 00:26:02,854
you'll know a lot more at the end of the
class than you did at the beginning of 

415
00:26:05,051 --> 00:26:08,320
the class and you'll find that that 
knowledge is extremely useful.

416
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,770
I truly believe that this knowledge can 
change your life.

417
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,570
Well.
That's what it was generated for it,

418
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,404
right?
It's generated by clinicians and 

419
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,693
personality psychologists.
That's what they're out there to do and 

420
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:23,560
they're all fair to take revealed 
potential.

421
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,813
It could be anything and to hammer it 
and shape it into something that's hard 

422
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:29,643
and pure and solid and you have to do a 
lot of reading and writing that faking 

423
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,663
to get to a point like that,
but it really beats the hell out of 

424
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:40,983
mucking about in the murk and 
unfortunately that's how many people 

425
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,730
live and I've seen the consequences of 
that.

426
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,850
And if you spend the next 30 years like 
that,

427
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:55,740
you will be old by the time you're 50.
And so I would recommend that.

428
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,670
So it's worth doing the work.
It's really worth.

429
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,250
So let's take a look now.
Well first I'll ask you if there are any

430
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:09,130
questions.
Any questions?

431
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:13,680
Yes.
Oh yeah.

432
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:16,650
I'll get the user name and passwords up 
to you pretty quick,

433
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,220
so I just have to make contact with the 
guy designed it was to get the code,

434
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:23,820
so won't be long.

435
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,920
Can you find?

436
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:32,290
I hope so.
That's the plan.

437
00:27:32,291 --> 00:27:35,050
Some of you have purchased it perhaps.
Okay,

438
00:27:35,051 --> 00:27:35,884
so it appears that you can.
There's also maybe some old texts from 

439
00:27:38,711 --> 00:27:41,720
right slack floating about.
You can use those to do.

440
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,563
You can get a good deal on them.
You can often get them second hand on 

441
00:27:44,561 --> 00:27:46,630
Amazon for like 20 bucks.
If you look,

442
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,950
the old text is fine except that it has 
more chapters in it,

443
00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:54,010
but if you pay attention,
careful attention to the syllabus,

444
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,113
that won't be a problem because all the 
chapters are numbered and all you have 

445
00:27:56,771 --> 00:28:00,040
to do is match the number on the 
syllabus to the number in the book.

446
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:05,460
So other questions?
Okay,

447
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:11,440
so let's take a look at what we're going
to learn about

448
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,110
lecture too.

449
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,740
Okay.

450
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,023
So you can think of human knowledge.
In some ways it was branching into two 

451
00:28:23,831 --> 00:28:24,664
components.
You can take them to those two 

452
00:28:26,861 --> 00:28:30,730
components as knowledge about the 
subject of world and knowledge about the

453
00:28:30,731 --> 00:28:33,220
objective world.
That's one way of thinking about it.

454
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,283
The other way you could think about it 
is knowledge about what things are and 

455
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:41,740
knowledge about what to do.
Now.

456
00:28:41,741 --> 00:28:45,160
Most of what you learn in university is 
knowledge about what things are,

457
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,623
but that's only half of what you need to
know because you really need to know 

458
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:50,923
what you should go about and do.
This is a real problem for human beings 

459
00:28:54,821 --> 00:28:55,654
because we're always trying to having to
think up what we should be doing next 

460
00:28:58,061 --> 00:29:00,490
and like that's the fundamental question
of life,

461
00:29:00,491 --> 00:29:01,270
which is,
well,

462
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,120
what should I do next?
Or what should I do tomorrow?

463
00:29:04,121 --> 00:29:07,060
Or what should I do next week or next 
month or next year?

464
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,893
Because that's another problem about 
being human is that not only do we have 

465
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,164
to figure out what to do next,
but we can also see the future or 

466
00:29:14,591 --> 00:29:17,580
multiple futures even,
and then we have to determine what those

467
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,463
futures could be and how to avoid others
that we don't want to have come into 

468
00:29:21,911 --> 00:29:22,744
existence at all and then how to 
configure our behaviors so that as we 

469
00:29:25,691 --> 00:29:26,524
navigate through the potential futures,
we land up more or less somewhere we 

470
00:29:30,071 --> 00:29:32,350
want and not somewhere we really don't 
want,

471
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,490
and so that's a real problem and one 
that's an existential problem in fact,

472
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,500
and what that means is that we need 
knowledge about the subjective and about

473
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:45,580
the behavioral.
It's part of potential.

474
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:50,140
How do you unravel yourself across time.
Now it's proved very difficult for human

475
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:52,900
beings to formalize that kind of 
knowledge.

476
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,313
Now we formalized scientific knowledge 
which has more knowledge about what 

477
00:29:56,531 --> 00:29:59,110
things are and about the objective 
world,

478
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,200
the scientific method,
especially the research method,

479
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:06,550
formalizes or knowledge about the 
objective world and about what it's made

480
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:09,400
of,
but it doesn't give us much insight into

481
00:30:09,401 --> 00:30:11,380
what to do about that.
All.

482
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:12,214
It seems to do actually is increase our 
power to do things but not necessarily 

483
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:16,654
to inform us as to the direction in 
which that power should be exerted and 

484
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:21,454
you don't really have to look any 
farther than the 20th century if you 

485
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:25,054
want historical proof of that,
because as people got more and more 

486
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:28,474
powerful so that we could sit in this 
lovely classroom and all be warm and 

487
00:30:31,271 --> 00:30:33,040
cozy,
while it's terrible outside,

488
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,190
we also learned how to kill each other 
with unprecedented

489
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:39,883
Gusto and potency.
And so science has enabled us on both 

490
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:47,330
sides and that's how it is.
Good or bad.

491
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,953
On the behavioral side,
there's a tradition of knowledge and 

492
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:54,394
it's an ancient tradition and it's 
grounded in forms of knowledge that are 

493
00:30:58,271 --> 00:31:02,800
likely tens of thousands of years old or
maybe even older than that.

494
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:03,634
And those are forms of knowledge that 
are essentially mythological for 

495
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:06,843
religious.
And the reason that I start with those 

496
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,870
is,
first of all,

497
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:15,670
religious systems are in many ways 
theories of personality.

498
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,133
Um,
and there's very tight associations 

499
00:31:18,761 --> 00:31:22,420
between certain religions and certain 
fields of psychology.

500
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:27,400
So Judaism that's been identified fairly
heavily with Freud and Christianity with

501
00:31:27,401 --> 00:31:29,720
Carl Jung's work and also with Carl 
Rogers,

502
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:30,843
Rogers was actually a seminarian and a 
lot of the ideas about what a person 

503
00:31:35,051 --> 00:31:35,884
could be.
So these are ideas about the ideal are 

504
00:31:38,621 --> 00:31:39,454
derived from religious and mythological 
substrates because they have to be 

505
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:45,060
derived from somewhere.
Right?

506
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:45,851
And so you think,
well,

507
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:49,570
how do people get their ideas about 
what's possible or what should be.

508
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:52,420
Part of it is through storytelling.
That's why you go to movies,

509
00:31:52,421 --> 00:31:54,790
right?
You go there to see what people could be

510
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,773
and you enact all those people on the 
screen with your bodies while it's 

511
00:31:58,721 --> 00:32:01,630
happening and you have a little neuro 
system that does that.

512
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:05,020
So it puts you right in the action.
It's an amazing ability,

513
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,273
amazing human ability.
And the reason we're so attracted to 

514
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:09,604
that sort of thing is because we want to
know what to do with ourselves and 

515
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:12,964
there's a very large body of very 
complex information that pertains to 

516
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:17,374
that.
One of the things that Carl young set 

517
00:32:19,181 --> 00:32:20,014
was that one of the things he believed 
was that that form of knowledge have 

518
00:32:24,131 --> 00:32:28,480
developed quite explicitly up to about 
the time of the renaissance or a boat at

519
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:32,070
the time of the Bacon and descartes who 
founded and Galileo,

520
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,063
who basically found the scientific 
method and then we sort of stopped 

521
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,413
developing that kind of knowledge and 
the knowledge of the objective world 

522
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,973
leapt ahead and in like exponentially 
and so that's left us with the same 

523
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:46,980
moral intelligence we have in the 17 
hundreds,

524
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,230
but with 21st century technology,
not necessarily a good thing.

525
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,910
So part of what we're doing in a sense 
is rescuing the past.

526
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,463
No.
In my other class sometimes I show 

527
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:01,820
Pinocchio the movie.
How many of you Seen Pinocchio?

528
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,980
I launched,
so yeah,

529
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:04,814
it's like the most popular animated 
movie ever made seconds I think is the 

530
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,993
line more partner.
There's one saving for Nokia where 

531
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,570
Pinocchio rescues is farther from a 
whale.

532
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:18,080
You may remember that.
You may notice that you watched that and

533
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:18,914
that was perfectly fine as far as you 
were concerned that you could watch on 

534
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,463
puppet swim with a cricket to the bottom
of the ocean and rescue his father from 

535
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,260
a whale.
It's like,

536
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,370
okay,
so the first thing you might think about

537
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:35,590
is how in the world could you sit there 
and swallow that and not even notice.

538
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:36,523
Notice,
notice that you were doing something as 

539
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:39,014
absurd,
as bizarre as any ritual you can 

540
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,413
possibly imagine while it's partly 
because we're very attracted to 

541
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:45,764
narrative and narrative's have 
structured narrative through both 

542
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:52,790
behavior and they have a deep structure 
and they have a deep symbolic structure.

543
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:53,624
So for example,
the whale in Pinocchio wasn't just any 

544
00:33:56,421 --> 00:33:59,510
ordinary whale because if you remember 
it also breathe,

545
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,373
smoke and fire.
It's very strange behavior for a whale 

546
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,640
and not make even a window that strange 
and that made it a dragon and so part of

547
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:13,010
what that meant was the Pinocchio was 
rescuing as far as from a dragon.

548
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,560
That's a very old story.
In fact,

549
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,220
that story is the oldest story that we 
have in written form.

550
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,293
It's a variant of a story that was told 
by the Mesopotamians pump 5,000 years 

551
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,800
ago,
so

552
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:30,580
part of that story means when you should
rescue your father from what?

553
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,773
Well,
from the murky chaos in which your 

554
00:34:33,161 --> 00:34:34,770
culture is embedded.
No,

555
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:39,470
you guys are all inheritors of rich 
cultural traditions.

556
00:34:39,471 --> 00:34:43,960
You know those aren't just words.
Those cultural traditions orient you.

557
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,500
They keep you sane and if they're 
desiccated,

558
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:49,810
the broken up and dad in archaic,
in line,

559
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:50,644
in the bottom of the chaos,
then you better get them back out of 

560
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:54,394
there because without them you're going 
to live shadow and difficult lives and 

561
00:34:57,911 --> 00:34:58,744
that's a bad idea.
So starting with the historical 

562
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:03,334
perspectives,
we can situate ourselves in maybe some 

563
00:35:06,311 --> 00:35:08,620
hundreds of thousands of years of 
history,

564
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,543
maybe even longer on I can.
I can tell you in one manner might be 

565
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:13,744
longer.

566
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:16,953
It turns out that part of the reason 
that we can see so well with which we 

567
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:21,454
can,
human beings can really see well way 

568
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:26,710
better than almost any other animal 
except hunting birds.

569
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:28,990
Hunting birds can see better than not,
but other than not,

570
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:33,460
man,
it's us and that's especially rare among

571
00:35:33,461 --> 00:35:35,710
mammals in particular,
the rare among primates.

572
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,190
So you might yourself,
well,

573
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:40,470
why can we see so well?
Well,

574
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,333
it turns out that part of the reason is 
that we call evolved with predatory 

575
00:35:44,221 --> 00:35:45,054
snakes.
So predatory snakes are newer than 

576
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:50,010
lizards by the way,
even though you wouldn't think so.

577
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,313
Aaron,
there's a woman at Ucla named Lynn 

578
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,711
Isabelle,
who was thinking,

579
00:35:55,711 --> 00:35:57,810
why do people see so well?
And so she went.

580
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,900
She had the snake detection theory 
because she'd worked with primates.

581
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:05,010
She knew they could really see the sort 
of camouflage patterns that snake hats,

582
00:36:05,011 --> 00:36:05,520
name,
Tab,

583
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,600
and the motion that they make.

584
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,433
They're really good at detecting now.
Plus human beings are very afraid of 

585
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:11,670
snakes innately.
Plus,

586
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:12,504
if you date chimpanzees who've never 
seen a snake and you throw a rubber 

587
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:17,580
snake in their cage,
assuming they're in a cage,

588
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:21,360
then they jumped to the top of the cage 
and because they're not happy about that

589
00:36:21,361 --> 00:36:22,194
snake,
but then they look at it and then if 

590
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:27,330
they're out in the jungle juggling 
around and they see a baby snake,

591
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:28,723
then they have a specific sort of pride 
they make and they'll stand there for 

592
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:32,184
like nine hours watching a big snake 
making this noise and all the other 

593
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:39,300
chimps depending on how afraid they are.
Also come and look at the snake.

594
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,793
And so yeah,
because they want to know what that 

595
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:45,090
sneaks up to you and that's what we want
to know too.

596
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,680
We want to know what the snakes are up 
to.

597
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,543
That's for sure.
And the circuit that we developed to 

598
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,833
detect snakes.
The visual circuit is partly what gives 

599
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:57,120
us such tremendous acuity of vision.
And partly the way Isabelle figured that

600
00:36:57,121 --> 00:36:57,954
out was by correlating primate visual 
acuity with the press and its 

601
00:37:01,771 --> 00:37:02,604
development over evolutionary time with 
the prevalence of predatory snakes in 

602
00:37:06,301 --> 00:37:08,850
that geographical region.
And she found that there was a very high

603
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,070
correlation,
so we can see sharply,

604
00:37:11,071 --> 00:37:11,904
partly because we're always looking for 
snakes and you know that pile of I'm 

605
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:17,850
done homework in your,
in your,

606
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,940
in your room,
that's snakes as far as the part of your

607
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:23,250
brain that developed to deal with snakes
is concerned.

608
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,593
And so you know,
if you leave a lot of things undone 

609
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,133
around you,
then all you've got snakes and you're 

610
00:37:31,231 --> 00:37:34,260
their target and so that's no way to 
live.

611
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,170
And so that whale down there at the 
bottom of the ocean,

612
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,780
that's kind of a very of snake to 
dragging,

613
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,480
even though it's a whale breathes fire,
right?

614
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,940
So let's call it the dragon.
That's what it is.

615
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,103
And the idea that you have to rescue 
something from the drag is an 

616
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:51,990
unbelievably old story.
And so that's partly what we're going to

617
00:37:51,991 --> 00:37:53,610
be doing at the beginning of this 
course.

618
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,773
We're going to be going way back to the 
merch and mark of prehistory trying to 

619
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:03,951
understand what the hell we've been up 
to for the last 60 million years because

620
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:05,334
that's when our tree dwelling ancestors 
first really started to deal with 

621
00:38:09,301 --> 00:38:10,134
predatory snakes and my suspicions are 
that you're all evolved from one of 

622
00:38:13,921 --> 00:38:14,754
those little tree dwelling rats.
The first one who figured out that if 

623
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:21,390
you drop the snake stick on a snake,
it would probably run away,

624
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:25,140
so that's what we've been doing for 60 
million years.

625
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:30,530
Throwing sticks at snakes.
So that's the first lecture and

626
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,793
you'll see why when you do the reading,
why this is broadly relevant because it 

627
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,833
also accounts at least in part for the 
human tendency to demonize people who 

628
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,114
aren't like us because it turns out that
we use the same circuit that we would 

629
00:38:49,991 --> 00:38:52,570
use to handle predatory reptiles.

630
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,750
Let's say we use that circuit,
the first process.

631
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:56,584
People who are strange to us and it 
makes sense because people who were 

632
00:38:59,261 --> 00:39:01,750
strange to us,
who come from different cultures and who

633
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:05,920
represent different ideals are 
unbelievably dangerous.

634
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,920
Even though they might also be 
unbelievably beneficial.

635
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,750
You know,
the coordinator of Americans,

636
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:14,140
they came out and they shook hands with 
the Europeans and then 95 percent of the

637
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,070
dive,
the next one,

638
00:39:15,071 --> 00:39:17,140
hundred and 50 years,
right?

639
00:39:17,141 --> 00:39:20,710
They all died in our place.
He died of smallpox.

640
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,600
They died of measles,
measles,

641
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:23,434
just wipe them out.
By the time the pilgrims came to North 

642
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:26,201
America,
which is,

643
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:27,034
you know,
fairly early in North American European 

644
00:39:29,621 --> 00:39:30,454
history,
95 percent of the Indians were already 

645
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:33,004
dead.
They were welcomed in the Europeans 

646
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:37,660
because they didn't have any people get 
their crops off.

647
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:42,160
So meeting someone who strange is no 
trivial thing,

648
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:44,620
and even if they don't poison me with 
some horrible illness,

649
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,573
they'll come along with some cockamamie 
idea like Marxism and you'll be Chinese 

650
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:52,780
and then it will be the 20th century in 
the 100 million of you will die.

651
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,433
It's very useful to understand the deep 
mythological structures that we live 

652
00:40:01,341 --> 00:40:02,174
inside and their relationship to our 
brain and our body really gives you 

653
00:40:05,061 --> 00:40:07,820
insight into how people function.
It's helpful.

654
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,153
The next lecture is on heroic and 
Shamanic initiations and that brings us 

655
00:40:16,401 --> 00:40:19,100
closer to the present than say 60 
million years ago.

656
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,143
It's more like 50,000 years ago and 
there are shamonic traditions all over 

657
00:40:23,601 --> 00:40:24,434
the world and the Shaman is kind of the 
precursor to the to the to the to the 

658
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:32,840
man of intelligence,
to the man of intellect,

659
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,183
the man of culture,
and he's sort of a doctor and a 

660
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:42,371
scientist and a priest all wrapped up 
into one thing and he's often the person

661
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:46,670
who's in charge of culture.
Many in many societies,

662
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:47,683
the Sherman has a vocabulary vocabulary 
that vastly exceeds that of his peers 

663
00:40:52,641 --> 00:40:53,474
and that's because he's been taught it 
in his initiatory process so that the 

664
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:01,910
culture within which that particular 
people survives can be

665
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,800
transmitted down the generations with 
very little error.

666
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:09,610
People can remember things that are 
transmitted verbally.

667
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,470
It preliterate cultures with 
unbelievable accuracy.

668
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,793
Under the shamanic initiation is very 
interest in the heroic initiations as 

669
00:41:17,571 --> 00:41:20,270
well are very interesting processes 
because they involve.

670
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,303
They involve death and rebirth and death
and rebirth is more or less equivalent 

671
00:41:27,561 --> 00:41:29,690
to change.
So here's something to think about.

672
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,160
So only if there's a mosquito and wants 
to make another mosquito,

673
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:37,010
it basically lays 10,000 eggs,
right?

674
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:37,844
And then all those eggs hatch and 9,999 
of those little mosquitoes die and then 

675
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,190
one mosquito makes it and lays another 
10,000 days.

676
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:48,590
So it's pretty costly reproductive 
strategy,

677
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,890
right?
So the way the mosquito works is that it

678
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:52,724
knows that the world is chaotic and 
dangerous and it has no idea how to 

679
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:57,374
survive in that.
So it just makes a whole pile of 

680
00:41:58,851 --> 00:41:59,684
mosquitoes and in hopes that one of them
will sneak through and each of those 

681
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:05,030
mosquitoes is a tiny bit different from 
each other.

682
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,480
Mosquito in terms of kind of place and 
also genetic structure.

683
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:13,250
And maybe one's got some little 
advantage that allows it to survive,

684
00:42:13,251 --> 00:42:14,590
but it's costly,
right?

685
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,583
It's 99,999 to one.
Otherwise we'd be covered with 

686
00:42:20,631 --> 00:42:21,980
mosquitoes.
So.

687
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,133
So the way in the mosquito deals with 
the fact that you can't figure out 

688
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:28,640
what's going on is by producing lots of 
mosquitoes.

689
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:33,470
But the way people figure out what's 
going on is by producing lots of ideas.

690
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:34,903
And ideas are the relationship of ideas 
to you and the external world is the 

691
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:45,140
same as the relationship of animals to 
the environment.

692
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:48,610
So there's a philosopher,
Alfred North Whitehead who said,

693
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:53,930
human beings evolved to let their ideas 
die instead of them.

694
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,270
Now that's a smart way of thinking 
because it means that you can put us off

695
00:42:59,271 --> 00:43:00,104
a little sub personality of yourself.
Maybe it's angry subpersonality or said 

696
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,370
seven personality or an irritated or 
presented folder,

697
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:08,260
you know?

698
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,260
No,
there aren't exactly.

699
00:43:09,261 --> 00:43:12,530
The idea is they're more like little 
spirits that are partly you.

700
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,990
They're kind of stupid because they've 
only go one direction,

701
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,853
but there's still variance of you and 
maybe you can present one of those to 

702
00:43:19,371 --> 00:43:22,280
someone which you might do if you're 
dating someone and you want to,

703
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,393
assuming you still do that.
If you're dating someone and you want 

704
00:43:25,921 --> 00:43:26,754
to,
we've pressed them.

705
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,673
Maybe you spin off some little variance 
of yourself that you think is 

706
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:31,790
particularly attractive,
probably won't work.

707
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,610
I noticed that work and if it doesn't 
work well,

708
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:36,770
then you can get all heartbroken and let
it die.

709
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:39,260
And then maybe the next one you spin off
will be a little more,

710
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:40,910
you know,
together.

711
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,193
And so that's how people progress a 
progress by dying and coming back to 

712
00:43:46,701 --> 00:43:49,610
life at different levels.
And I mean maybe you're just taking some

713
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:54,050
little ratty mistake and so you can let 
it go and you're only shaved momentarily

714
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,093
and it's only a little pain when that 
circuit dies or maybe it's your whole 

715
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:00,760
damn personality that has to go,
you know,

716
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:01,643
that happens to people when they 
encounter a catastrophe of one form or 

717
00:44:03,861 --> 00:44:04,694
another.

718
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,980
So that might happen to someone close to
you dies.

719
00:44:06,981 --> 00:44:09,890
Or if you lose a landlord,
if you get an illness or you know,

720
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:13,940
any of the horrible things that planning
people to very deep levels,

721
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:14,803
which might mean pretty much all of you 
has to go and maybe you'll actually 

722
00:44:17,541 --> 00:44:18,800
died.
But if you don't,

723
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:23,000
well you can let go of what's holding 
you back.

724
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:26,240
And maybe that's your old self and then 
you can come back to life.

725
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:30,560
And I will tell you it's a lot better to
do that voluntarily before.

726
00:44:30,561 --> 00:44:34,890
It's that in voluntarily in a moment of 
crisis.

727
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:39,150
And I would say in some ways that's the 
lesson of clinical psychology.

728
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,583
Confront the damn snakes first because 
it's really hard to get out of their 

729
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:49,671
bellies once they beat on you.
So the shopping is shamonic.

730
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:53,700
Initiations are death and rebirth 
initiations.

731
00:44:53,701 --> 00:44:58,701
They formalize that you're often the 
rituals themselves are often accompanied

732
00:44:59,371 --> 00:45:02,130
by the use of different classes of 
hallucinogens,

733
00:45:02,131 --> 00:45:02,964
which for one reason or another seem to 
facilitate at least symbolically the 

734
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:11,010
process of transformation from life to 
death and back to life.

735
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:16,580
So there are dramatizations of the 
process by which people learn.

736
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:17,963
You learn something to really learn some
presupposition that you had before that 

737
00:45:22,561 --> 00:45:27,561
has to crumble and then the new 
information comes in and you can build a

738
00:45:27,931 --> 00:45:28,764
new self around it,
but that's a painful process and that's 

739
00:45:30,781 --> 00:45:34,470
part of why people stick to their ideas 
or their past selves.

740
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:35,943
No one

741
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,470
you could stick to your past self and 
that would be fine,

742
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:43,720
except that everything's changing around
you all the time.

743
00:45:43,721 --> 00:45:44,554
And so if you don't change,
then you just get more and more 

744
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:49,030
outdated.
You're more and more archaic.

745
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,430
None of your precept positions of work 
anymore.

746
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:52,503
And so you're like,
you're like this rusty machine clanking 

747
00:45:56,321 --> 00:45:57,154
around,
running into things all the time when 

748
00:45:58,211 --> 00:46:01,590
your life is miserable because you don't
fit the environment anymore.

749
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,470
And so when I talk about personality and
its transformations,

750
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:06,573
something that you could ask yourself,
which is in some way the most 

751
00:46:08,981 --> 00:46:11,350
fundamental question you can ask 
yourself is,

752
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:13,083
are you the thing that stays the same or
are you the thing that changes and you 

753
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:22,090
know,
the thing that changes can live in a lot

754
00:46:22,091 --> 00:46:25,240
more places.
And so that's we're thinking about,

755
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:26,343
but the cost is well,
when you changed your diet a little bit 

756
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:33,220
and that's painful or maybe you die a 
lot and that's really painful.

757
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,210
So if you ever wonder why people don't 
change,

758
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,120
that's part of the reason.
Then we.

759
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:41,223
The next section is on constructivism.
We're going to talk mostly about PSA is 

760
00:46:45,071 --> 00:46:46,840
not actually a developmental 
psychologist.

761
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:56,830
I like piaget because Piaget had an 
interest in question is,

762
00:46:56,831 --> 00:46:57,664
which is,
it's not the genetic question or an 

763
00:46:59,471 --> 00:47:02,060
environmental question.
You know,

764
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:04,600
you might think those are the only two 
kinds of questions there are when you're

765
00:47:04,601 --> 00:47:06,730
thinking about the tall,
but it's not exactly that.

766
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,793
Here's why
it's not clear to what degree your 

767
00:47:12,581 --> 00:47:16,720
specified by your genes.
So here's one possibility,

768
00:47:16,721 --> 00:47:17,554
so let's say that encoded in your 
genetic structure or whole variety of 

769
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,580
potential use,
like who knows how many,

770
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,160
oh,
the potential use,

771
00:47:27,161 --> 00:47:27,994
but the entire history of mankind been 
able to weave into their genetic 

772
00:47:31,001 --> 00:47:31,834
structure.
They're all sitting down there encoded 

773
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,173
in your genes and then that very complex
structure that's rife with potential 

774
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:39,933
pops out into a particular environment 
and then it interacts with that 

775
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:43,834
environment like a program interacts 
with the computer and gathers 

776
00:47:46,421 --> 00:47:47,254
information of one form or another that 
takes that information and the material 

777
00:47:50,891 --> 00:47:53,980
that is appropriate and builds the real 
you out of that.

778
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,173
And that's what piaget was studying.
He was trying to figure out how as a 

779
00:47:58,991 --> 00:47:59,824
child go about taking itself from this 
thing that just lays there squawks 

780
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,420
basically to something that's,
you know,

781
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,760
you go on Youtube and you see what 
people can do,

782
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,070
what human beings can do.
It's bloody unbelievable.

783
00:48:12,071 --> 00:48:16,600
I mean we're sold ridiculously 
versatile.

784
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:19,460
People can do things that are just 
impossible in,

785
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:21,070
in every dimension,
you know,

786
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:23,050
intellectually,
physically,

787
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:24,470
spiritually,
it,

788
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:25,510
even eat,
hotdogs,

789
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:26,433
set a rate that you can hardly imagine.
We're very variable and Pinochet was 

790
00:48:31,901 --> 00:48:32,734
very interested in trying to figure out 
how all of that embodied variability 

791
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:39,730
could come out of this little package of
potential at the beginning of life.

792
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,610
It's very interesting.
So that's constructivism.

793
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:43,563
How does the individual construct him or
herself from nothing in some ways from 

794
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:49,683
birth forward and so Psj,
especially his discussion of infant 

795
00:48:53,351 --> 00:48:54,184
development,
sort of like the analysis of the 

796
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:59,100
unfolding of a human being and because 
people were doing full to you though,

797
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,213
because babies when they're born they'll
crunched up like this and so they have 

798
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:08,041
to stretch out and you know,
get going and I was concerned so.

799
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:10,870
So that's,
that's good.

800
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,960
And then we go from there to depth 
psychology.

801
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,380
You might think about that more a 
psychoanalysis now

802
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:22,150
people
have,

803
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:26,530
people aren't very happy generally 
speaking about psychoanalytic theory,

804
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:27,873
especially if they're research oriented,
but there's a variety of reasons for 

805
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:32,800
that.
And one of the business,

806
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:35,520
they don't know anything about it.
That would be the first place.

807
00:49:35,521 --> 00:49:36,354
And then people are often tempted to 
denigrate anything they don't 

808
00:49:39,821 --> 00:49:40,654
understand.
It's actually kind hard to understand 

809
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:45,250
psychoanalytic thinking.
It's in fact,

810
00:49:45,251 --> 00:49:46,084
it's very hard.

811
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,713
And the other thing about like 
scientists and research scientists who 

812
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:56,050
are engaged in psychological work is 
they're actually usually fairly mentally

813
00:49:56,051 --> 00:49:57,690
healthy.
You know,

814
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:59,860
at least they're healthy enough to be 
scientists,

815
00:49:59,861 --> 00:50:00,694
which you know,
you've got to be pretty healthy to be a 

816
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:03,100
scientist,
to go to be disciplined,

817
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:05,140
you got to be able to get up and go to 
work every day.

818
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,270
You have to be able to think about 
complex things.

819
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:10,120
You have to be very orderly and 
persistent,

820
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:13,480
you know?
And so there's a lot of demand on you if

821
00:50:13,481 --> 00:50:14,314
you're a scientific researcher.
So the problem with scientific research 

822
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:19,730
is they hang around with other 
scientific research,

823
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22,080
then they think that's what human beings
are like.

824
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:25,690
And human beings are nothing like 
scientific researchers.

825
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,250
There are a tiny minority of the 
population.

826
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:32,060
There is bizarre.
It's like Albino Buffalo and to to think

827
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:35,060
of them as representative of human 
beings is insane.

828
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,073
First of all,
most of them have high in the 99th 

829
00:50:37,671 --> 00:50:38,504
percentile,
so it's like why bother even thinking 

830
00:50:40,911 --> 00:50:44,810
about them?
Normal human beings are very weird,

831
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:46,003
especially the ones that don't function 
well and not functioning well is 

832
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:54,820
bottomless pit that that's why hell is 
because not functioning well.

833
00:50:54,861 --> 00:50:55,694
It's a bottomless pit and if you're 
dealing with people who aren't 

834
00:50:58,101 --> 00:51:00,860
functioning well,
one of the most mysterious things is how

835
00:51:00,861 --> 00:51:01,694
they can take a situation that's gone 
off of beyond your worst imaginings and 

836
00:51:05,901 --> 00:51:08,900
then think up three or four creative 
ways to make it worse.

837
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,153
Ten,
if you're dealing with somebody like 

838
00:51:11,031 --> 00:51:13,430
that and you do,
if you're a clinician,

839
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:15,440
if you're dealing with someone like 
that,

840
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:18,470
good luck with your behavioral 
interventions.

841
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:19,543
Man,
that's like throwing sticks at an 

842
00:51:21,321 --> 00:51:22,154
elephant.
You're just going to get anywhere and 

843
00:51:24,741 --> 00:51:26,600
one of the ways I want to demonstrate 
this to you,

844
00:51:26,601 --> 00:51:30,410
I'm going to show you a film called 
crumb crumbs.

845
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:31,243
A harsh film,
but it's the best documentary by the 

846
00:51:33,141 --> 00:51:33,974
way,
of an underground comic named Robert 

847
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,073
Crump who's actually quite a genius even
though he's perverse in precisely the 

848
00:51:41,121 --> 00:51:44,780
Friday in ways that are interesting and 
his brothers or even worse,

849
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:49,820
so I'll walk you through that because I 
can't figure out any other way of giving

850
00:51:49,821 --> 00:51:52,850
you a taste of what Freudian 
psychopathology is like.

851
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:53,803
It's not pretty and that's the other 
reason that sort of clean minded 

852
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:57,733
research scientists don't like 
psychoanalytic thinking because it's 

853
00:52:01,581 --> 00:52:02,414
really in many ways it deals with the 
most disgusting elements of human 

854
00:52:06,201 --> 00:52:07,034
behavior and so
it's not even that pleasant to think 

855
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:14,720
about.
And then there's you who will talk about

856
00:52:14,721 --> 00:52:15,554
after Freud and young is so strange that
he makes Freud look normal and you 

857
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,710
believed that as,
as I mentioned earlier,

858
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:28,400
I believe that there is a universal 
grammar of ethics,

859
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:29,263
of morality.

860
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,310
It's not arbitrary.
It's not relative.

861
00:52:31,311 --> 00:52:33,200
You know,
in the universities,

862
00:52:33,201 --> 00:52:34,034
the theater has been,
at least since the 19 sixties that one 

863
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:38,654
person's ethics is as good as another 
person and there's no way of 

864
00:52:41,211 --> 00:52:44,240
distinguishing reliably between them.
Well,

865
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,150
I happen to think that's absolute 
nonsense.

866
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:51,110
It's also extremely dangerous nonsense 
and I also think there's no evidence for

867
00:52:51,111 --> 00:52:54,620
it whatsoever because we now know a lot 
about human universals,

868
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,513
which are aspects of human behavior that
are constant across all cultures and 

869
00:52:58,821 --> 00:53:01,760
there are a lot of them.
There are a lot of at.

870
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:02,603
The other thing is there's just not that
many ways that half mad primates can 

871
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:09,350
gather together in large groups and live
productively.

872
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:10,303
It's not easy like you think of all the 
civilization work that went into 

873
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:15,074
allowing all you people from all these 
different cultures to sit here in peace 

874
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:20,983
and comfort.

875
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:24,530
It's mind boggling if you think there's 
a million ways to do that.

876
00:53:24,531 --> 00:53:27,900
Well think again,
maybe there's one way to do that,

877
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,460
you know,
and we do it well enough.

878
00:53:29,461 --> 00:53:33,250
So here we are and no one's being knifed
so,

879
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,753
so that's you.
And he's profound beyond belief really 

880
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:43,740
beyond belief.
So that's.

881
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:46,380
Those guys all dealt with unconscious.
Now.

882
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:47,703
It's interesting to think about what the
unconscious means and so I can give you 

883
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:52,470
a bit of a hint.
It's,

884
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:57,300
it's partly the information that's coded
in your behavior,

885
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,253
so for example,
there are a lot of things that you can 

886
00:53:59,971 --> 00:54:02,700
do with your body that you don't know 
how you do,

887
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:05,010
like you don't know how you want,
for example,

888
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:06,930
or how do you ride a bike or how you 
talk.

889
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:09,860
You can talk,
but you don't know how you talk.

890
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:13,020
You just move your mouth.
I hope you get the point right.

891
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:17,400
You have no conscious apprehension 
whatsoever of the micro details that are

892
00:54:17,401 --> 00:54:18,234
necessary to allow you to move your 
mouth so there's a lot of information 

893
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:22,104
encoded in you that you don't have 
conscious access to and it's not only 

894
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,073
physiologically and code.
It's also culturally encoded because 

895
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:31,263
you've been targeted and shaped by the 
interactions of all the people you've 

896
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:40,140
ever encountered and they in turn by all
the people they've ever encountered,

897
00:54:40,141 --> 00:54:40,974
including their ancestors.
So you're the product of this 

898
00:54:42,721 --> 00:54:43,554
unbelievably complex,
multigenerational exchange of 

899
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:47,484
information that in some ways is all 
about how to make you acceptable to the 

900
00:54:51,961 --> 00:54:55,050
public.
And there's only certain ways you can be

901
00:54:55,051 --> 00:54:57,690
acceptable to the public.
You know,

902
00:54:57,691 --> 00:55:00,210
you have to be relatively clean,
for example,

903
00:55:00,211 --> 00:55:01,044
at least in our society,
you can't be too boring or you won't 

904
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:06,620
have any friends.
You also can't be too excited.

905
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,300
No,
you can't be too violent.

906
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:14,870
You can't be too empty headed unless 
you're associating with people who liked

907
00:55:14,871 --> 00:55:16,760
to feel superior.
You know there's,

908
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,990
there's.
We put a lot of demands on each other in

909
00:55:18,991 --> 00:55:23,991
terms of what constitutes acceptibility,
let alone ideal.

910
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,240
We're always telling each other about 
both of those.

911
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:28,560
What's acceptable,
what's ideal.

912
00:55:28,561 --> 00:55:29,394
Every interaction you have shapes you 
into an approximation of acceptable in 

913
00:55:35,761 --> 00:55:37,890
ideal,
and that's all encoded in youtube.

914
00:55:37,891 --> 00:55:38,724
It's encoded in your behavior.
It's also encoded in your imagination 

915
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,053
and that's why you can go to a movie and
you can instantly identify the hero and 

916
00:55:44,731 --> 00:55:45,564
the villain,
which is of course the first thing you 

917
00:55:46,621 --> 00:55:49,230
do when you go to a movie because 
otherwise it can't make sense out of it,

918
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:52,860
and so that encoding prior to 
articulation,

919
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:53,993
that's on the unconscious and that's 
what the psychoanalysts were interested 

920
00:55:56,731 --> 00:55:57,564
in analytics.
Now the cognitive neuroscientists have 

921
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:00,520
kind of gone up there too,
but there's.

922
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,373
They're deluded into thinking that 
what's in your head is information and 

923
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,184
that it's ideas and those are sort of 
cold and dead things and your hand is 

924
00:56:07,981 --> 00:56:08,814
not full of ideas and information that's
full of devils and snakes and the 

925
00:56:12,421 --> 00:56:13,254
psychoanalysts knew that,
and by that I mean you're alive and so 

926
00:56:17,161 --> 00:56:17,994
are your sub components and all your 
little subpersonalities and aren't just 

927
00:56:21,271 --> 00:56:23,110
ideas.
They see,

928
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:25,160
hear it,
feel it,

929
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:26,650
have aids.
As you know.

930
00:56:26,651 --> 00:56:28,710
For example,
when you get possessed by anger,

931
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:29,763
the anger can be entirely destructive.
I want to bring down the person I love 

932
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:37,080
half an hour later you're like,
what the hell was I thinking about it?

933
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:37,983
Like,
yeah,

934
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:39,280
no kidding.
Well,

935
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:40,114
you weren't thinking.
You're just possessed by some 

936
00:56:42,701 --> 00:56:45,730
personality and that's what the 
psychoanalysts were interested in.

937
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,970
Subpersonalities fantasies.

938
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,053
Next week,
go to the humanists and the 

939
00:56:53,081 --> 00:56:53,914
existentialists.
Now they're interesting because they 

940
00:56:56,261 --> 00:56:57,094
come at the problem of what's wrong with
people from a kind of universalist 

941
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,350
perspective.
Now for fraud,

942
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:03,813
if you weren't sick,
you were healthy and that seems obvious 

943
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:07,623
because we think you can make a clear 
distinction between second healthy but 

944
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:12,910
the existentialists.
They didn't want any of that.

945
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:18,450
Their hypothesis was if you're human,
you're sick,

946
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:21,363
there's no way out,
and the reason you're sick in a sense 

947
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:24,743
and unlike any other animal is the life 
itself poses a paradoxical problem to 

948
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:31,204
you,
partly because you're so conscious 

949
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,073
because you're self conscious and 
actually a sequence of paradoxical 

950
00:57:36,611 --> 00:57:39,970
problems.
A how do you live when you're vulnerable

951
00:57:39,971 --> 00:57:40,804
and mortal?
That's a rough one because you might 

952
00:57:42,971 --> 00:57:43,391
say,
well,

953
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:44,224
why should I go on at all or who's going
to know anyways in the thousand years 

954
00:57:47,051 --> 00:57:51,550
are a million years or why is there 
suffering,

955
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,070
or how do you go on in the face of 
cruelty?

956
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:55,593
Those are questions that grip at 
people's soul and crush it and they're 

957
00:57:59,951 --> 00:58:03,010
not a consequence of mental illness.
It's like,

958
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:03,923
what?
How long should it take you to recover 

959
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:08,170
if your whole family is wiped out in a 
car accident?

960
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:10,120
What's healthy?
Well,

961
00:58:10,121 --> 00:58:11,980
we don't know the answer to that.
It's like,

962
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:13,083
shouldn't you ever recover?
Maybe a fewer halfways in path that 

963
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:18,250
would just kill you.
You know,

964
00:58:18,251 --> 00:58:21,480
a lot of times people can't recover from
their grief because they're building.

965
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:22,660
If they,
how can I?

966
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:23,733
How can I live with all of those people 
close to me died and they died on 

967
00:58:26,321 --> 00:58:28,540
therapy.
That's an existential problem.

968
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:33,840
And then there's one class which is 
vulnerability and more talented.

969
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:35,523
Everyone's got that stereotype.
So how do you deal with that hard 

970
00:58:39,281 --> 00:58:41,920
question.
Second class of problems?

971
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:46,710
Well,
everybody's always evaluating always and

972
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:50,080
you're never good enough.
So what that means is that you're always

973
00:58:50,081 --> 00:58:52,720
in an insufficient relationship with 
society in history.

974
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:56,320
No matter how good you get,
it's not good enough.

975
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:02,370
And so history itself as well as culture
always faces you as a judge.

976
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:07,220
And so that's the second category of 
existential problem.

977
00:59:07,221 --> 00:59:08,054
Then the third problem is well,
what to do about you yourself know 

978
00:59:12,821 --> 00:59:13,654
there's nature you have to contend with 
and there's culture you will have to 

979
00:59:15,731 --> 00:59:16,564
contend with,
and then you've got yourself and your 

980
00:59:19,211 --> 00:59:20,044
self consciousness and your deep 
knowledge of all the things about you 

981
00:59:22,221 --> 00:59:23,054
that could really use some repair.
And the thing about those prompts is 

982
00:59:26,061 --> 00:59:28,320
that everyone has them and they always 
have the,

983
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:30,620
as far as we know,
they always will,

984
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:33,260
and so they're built into the condition 
of being human.

985
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:38,470
And that's what existentialism is about.
It's like life is a paradoxical problem.

986
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:43,760
Is there any possible solution to a 
paradoxical problem?

987
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:45,170
Well that's,
that's,

988
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:47,990
that's in some ways the question of the 
meaning of life.

989
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:51,740
And one hint is that what?
What's the meaning of life?

990
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,320
And one answer to that is this is the 
hand,

991
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:55,303
is that the meaning to life is the 
pattern of thought and action that you 

992
00:59:59,541 --> 01:00:04,541
take that enables you to tolerate at 
least tolerate the conditions of luck.

993
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,150
And then maybe you could move one step 
beyond that.

994
01:00:08,151 --> 01:00:08,984
If you're feeling a little optimistic 
and say meaning of life is the pattern 

995
01:00:11,661 --> 01:00:12,494
of consumption inaction that enables you
to welcome the conditions of life and 

996
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:17,864
then you might ask yourself,
is there such a mode of being given the 

997
01:00:20,871 --> 01:00:22,970
nature of the problem that you have to 
contend with it?

998
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:25,760
Is there actually a motive be that would
enable that?

999
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:29,720
You could say the vulnerability,
the judgment,

1000
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:34,040
the insufficiency,
it's worth it under these conditions and

1001
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:37,970
that's the other existential question.
The people who post those questions,

1002
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:41,480
they weren't messing around.
You're going to read people like frankl,

1003
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:45,980
Viktor Frankl and their social needs and
what those do people live through.

1004
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:47,173
I mean it's unimaginably horrible and 
when they were wrestling with the 

1005
01:00:51,501 --> 01:00:54,860
questions that I just described,
they weren't academic.

1006
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:56,653
They weren't academic issues.
They were embodied issues of life and 

1007
01:01:01,551 --> 01:01:02,384
culture and genocide and cruelty
and so their examination of that had to 

1008
01:01:10,371 --> 01:01:11,204
be deep enough
to be able to contend with questions 

1009
01:01:14,781 --> 01:01:17,750
like that and answers that are deep 
enough to contend with.

1010
01:01:17,751 --> 01:01:20,330
Questions like that are frightening 
answers

1011
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:25,640
and we have reading week,
it'll be a relief.

1012
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:35,083
The last part of the course,
this is when we switched over to the 

1013
01:01:38,721 --> 01:01:41,240
more scientific domain and so we're 
going to do two things.

1014
01:01:41,241 --> 01:01:42,074
As I said,
we're going to take a pretty deep look 

1015
01:01:43,641 --> 01:01:44,474
at how the brain functions as far as we 
know in our current state of 

1016
01:01:48,111 --> 01:01:53,111
unimaginable ignorance like we're.
We really know so little about the brain

1017
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,780
or maybe we know a bit of a bit about 
the brain,

1018
01:01:56,781 --> 01:01:57,614
but we certainly don't know anything yet
about consciousness and consciousness 

1019
01:02:00,471 --> 01:02:03,710
seems to be a very relevant part of the 
brain,

1020
01:02:03,711 --> 01:02:04,544
right?
It's sort of the part that everybody 

1021
01:02:05,271 --> 01:02:08,840
cares about.
Six consciousness in some sense seems to

1022
01:02:08,841 --> 01:02:11,450
be you even more than your brain is you.
I mean,

1023
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:13,790
your brain's just this thing inside your
skull,

1024
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:16,220
but your consciousness,
you know,

1025
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,233
that's your being.
We don't have a clue about 

1026
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:23,430
consciousness.
I our scientific,

1027
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:27,090
we're not even able to conceptualize it 
in a scientific manner.

1028
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:28,980
It's a real mystery.
So,

1029
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:29,963
but having said that,
there's still plenty of things that are 

1030
01:02:31,741 --> 01:02:34,860
interesting to know about the brain.
One of the things we're going to do,

1031
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,880
and this is sort of associated with the 
idea of the end,

1032
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:39,093
you know,
the end for Freud was the natural self 

1033
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:42,863
and so that was your primordial.
You could think about them as drives or 

1034
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,910
temptations or,
or values.

1035
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:51,500
Values is probably the most accurate 
anger,

1036
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,160
sexuality,
those are the top two,

1037
01:02:53,161 --> 01:02:53,994
Friday and concerns.
There's plenty others eating for didn't 

1038
01:02:56,941 --> 01:02:57,774
care about that we do now because 
everyone has an eating disorder or 

1039
01:03:00,631 --> 01:03:04,980
virtually everyone.
So for the Victorians it was sexuality.

1040
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:08,010
For us it's food.
Sex doesn't seem to be a problem,

1041
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:13,240
but we just can't eat anymore.
So we're going to take a look at the low

1042
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:17,580
level biological systems in the brain 
and those are systems go on.

1043
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:21,840
Some of those systems are so old that 
even crustaceans have.

1044
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:24,420
So for example,
this is so cool.

1045
01:03:24,421 --> 01:03:25,254
So if you give a lobster who's being 
defeated in a dominance fight because 

1046
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:34,770
they fight for dominance and they might 
even know it if you mean the lobster.

1047
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,830
If you take a lobster who's been 
defeated in a dominance dispute,

1048
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:39,743
he'll go back to his little lobster hole
and pout and when out and he gets all 

1049
01:03:44,281 --> 01:03:45,114
collapsed and you can't even read it.
Get them out of his hole with a stick 

1050
01:03:47,401 --> 01:03:48,234
because he's going to sit in there and 
be upset about his dominance defeat and 

1051
01:03:52,231 --> 01:03:54,720
maybe he'll come on with kind of a new 
lobster already.

1052
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:55,583
Go again and maybe not.
If you take that same lobster and you 

1053
01:03:58,931 --> 01:04:01,440
give him anti depressants right after he
fights,

1054
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:06,690
he won't go back into his cave and hide 
and he'll fight right away again,

1055
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:08,040
and so you think about that.

1056
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:08,873
That means that the circuitry that 
underlies our defeat related depression 

1057
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:18,420
is 300 million years old and even 
crustaceans have

1058
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:22,440
so that's way down in your brainstem 
man,

1059
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,360
because lobsters hardly even have 
brains.

1060
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:27,390
In fact,
if the last year has been tough and he's

1061
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:30,990
been launched here for a long time and 
he gets defeated badly,

1062
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:34,890
then when he goes off to pout,
he has to dissolve as whole brain is.

1063
01:04:34,891 --> 01:04:35,724
All he does is dominant stop.
Then it grows a new subordinate brain 

1064
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,713
weasels around with that for now.
So and that's useful to think about the 

1065
01:04:43,501 --> 01:04:46,950
next time you to get defeated because 
all that pain you're going through,

1066
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:51,390
it's like you've got some circuit 
repairs to make and if you've been badly

1067
01:04:51,391 --> 01:04:52,224
defeated,
well maybe you should just let yourself 

1068
01:04:53,371 --> 01:04:57,630
collapsed and all of that stuff clear 
away so you could come back.

1069
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:04,380
So that's low level stuff.
Brainstem stuff.

1070
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:06,490
It's way down at the bottom of your 
being,

1071
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:07,383
you know,
but we're going to talk about systems 

1072
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:10,500
that are above that too,
but still low.

1073
01:05:10,501 --> 01:05:11,880
The hypothalamus,
for example,

1074
01:05:11,881 --> 01:05:15,390
it's a very cool brain area.
It sort of responsible for all the basic

1075
01:05:15,391 --> 01:05:16,224
drives,
hunger,

1076
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:17,250
temperature,
regulation,

1077
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:19,140
sexuality,
um,

1078
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,860
defensive aggression,
predatory aggression.

1079
01:05:21,861 --> 01:05:25,030
It looks like it's something different.
Everyone has those systems,

1080
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,233
you know,
so they're like these sub beings that 

1081
01:05:27,671 --> 01:05:28,504
live inside us,
but they're also preconditions for 

1082
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:31,350
communication.
You know,

1083
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:32,203
because you might say to your friend or 
an angry today and your friend doesn't 

1084
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:35,651
say,
well,

1085
01:05:35,651 --> 01:05:37,930
what do you mean angry?
He says,

1086
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,230
well,
what happened to upset?

1087
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,180
Because he knows what anger begins and 
the reason he knows that his,

1088
01:05:43,181 --> 01:05:45,430
because he's already it in his head.
He's like,

1089
01:05:45,431 --> 01:05:47,830
you.
He gets angry,

1090
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:49,370
get sad,
gets afraid.

1091
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:52,120
Basic emotions,
but not only the basic emotions,

1092
01:05:52,121 --> 01:05:54,540
but the basic motivations.
And so we're gonna.

1093
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,393
Look at the brain systems that underlie 
the basic motivations and the basic 

1094
01:05:59,351 --> 01:06:00,184
emotions.
And in some sense those systems are 

1095
01:06:02,231 --> 01:06:07,080
equivalent to the physiological 
incarnation of the end.

1096
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:10,180
That Freud described that the end of the
19th century.

1097
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:11,283
And so that's a nice way to look at it.
You'll build through the psychoanalytic 

1098
01:06:13,091 --> 01:06:14,980
thinking,
which,

1099
01:06:14,981 --> 01:06:18,480
which kind of puts flesh on these 
systems because for the psychoanalyst,

1100
01:06:18,481 --> 01:06:21,460
and this is why they're still relevant.
Those weren't just systems.

1101
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,580
Hey,
we're living personalities.

1102
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:28,030
Narrow one I personalities,
they only want one thing,

1103
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,580
but personalities nonetheless,
ancient gone.

1104
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:34,360
That's another way of looking at and 
things.

1105
01:06:34,361 --> 01:06:38,230
You have to condense it again with 
whether you believe in them or not.

1106
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:44,170
We'll discuss all five traits as well.
Extroversion,

1107
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:46,210
as I said,
that's positive emotion.

1108
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:48,640
Neuroticism,
that's negative emotion.

1109
01:06:48,641 --> 01:06:51,100
People vary on those dimensions.
Agreeableness,

1110
01:06:51,101 --> 01:06:51,934
that seems to be associated with 
maternal behavior on one end and 

1111
01:06:54,881 --> 01:06:59,230
predatory hunting on another because 
human beings are hunters and mammals.

1112
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:00,940
It's a weird combination,
right?

1113
01:07:00,941 --> 01:07:01,774
Because if you're a hunting panel,
you got to figure out how not to kill 

1114
01:07:04,001 --> 01:07:05,920
and eat your children.
Right?

1115
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:08,020
And that happens in lots of mammalian 
species,

1116
01:07:08,021 --> 01:07:11,020
especially among the males.
So they have to be moved away,

1117
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,600
but he would have solved that more or 
less.

1118
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:14,963
You know,
it gets complicated in mixed families 

1119
01:07:17,141 --> 01:07:19,990
because if you're the child of the step 
parent,

1120
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:24,670
you have 100 times the likelihood of 
being abused,

1121
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:26,643
so we'll talk about conscientiousness,
which is a great predictor of longterm 

1122
01:07:30,581 --> 01:07:31,414
life success,
but also associated with fascist 

1123
01:07:33,341 --> 01:07:34,174
political priest predispositions because
it turns out that the way you vote has 

1124
01:07:37,841 --> 01:07:38,674
very little to do with what you say and 
very much to do with what your 

1125
01:07:42,521 --> 01:07:43,354
temperament is.
So even for high level cognitive 

1126
01:07:48,341 --> 01:07:49,174
functions like political belief,
these underlying systems play in 

1127
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,920
determining role.
Last two things.

1128
01:07:56,921 --> 01:08:01,090
We're going to talk about performance 
prediction and by that I mean well,

1129
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,580
there's been accruing evidence.

1130
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:06,640
You might say,
what?

1131
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,430
What,
what?

1132
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:09,070
How do you have a happy life?
First of all,

1133
01:08:09,071 --> 01:08:12,790
I wouldn't say that's a stupid question,
but we'll go because happiness isn't.

1134
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:15,260
It's not the right eight.
It's,

1135
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:18,300
it's a way.
It's not a place to go.

1136
01:08:18,330 --> 01:08:22,350
It's a matter of manifestation while 
your journey,

1137
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:24,720
something like that.
Leaving that aside,

1138
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:27,570
what do you need to live a high quality 
life?

1139
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:29,370
Well,
we kind of know that already.

1140
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:31,500
I mean,
it's kind of obvious.

1141
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,920
No need friends,
need intimate relationships,

1142
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,300
lead meaningful work,
you know,

1143
01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:39,960
how are you more money than we'll pay 
your pills,

1144
01:08:39,961 --> 01:08:42,420
doesn't seem to help that much,
etc. Etc.

1145
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:43,340
So it's likE,
you know,

1146
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:45,750
it's like intelligent moderation and 
disciplines.

1147
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:48,360
Very boring.
It'S exactly what you'd expect.

1148
01:08:48,361 --> 01:08:50,430
if you were pessimistic about 
excitement,

1149
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:53,003
performance prediction,
we're going to look very carefully at 

1150
01:08:54,811 --> 01:08:57,180
the nature of the traits that make 
people successful in life.

1151
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:57,991
And you know,
you might say,

1152
01:08:57,991 --> 01:08:59,630
well,
what do you mean by successful?

1153
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:00,773
You know,
one of the things I mean is not in too 

1154
01:09:02,581 --> 01:09:03,414
much pain and anxiety is that turns out 
to actually be more important to people 

1155
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,700
than being happy.
You know,

1156
01:09:08,701 --> 01:09:10,750
if you say to people,
what do you want?

1157
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:11,603
They say I want to be happy,
but if you analyze what they mean by 

1158
01:09:13,531 --> 01:09:14,364
happy,
they mostly need not suffering and not 

1159
01:09:17,521 --> 01:09:20,730
terrified.
You get those two things under control.

1160
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,350
Like the worst that can happen to you is
that you'll be bored.

1161
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,710
And then we'll wrap it up at the end.
Okay.

1162
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:31,460
so that's the course.
So I'm,

1163
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:36,390
I'm glad to be teaching it.
It's good to see all of you here.

1164
01:09:36,391 --> 01:09:38,310
It looks like you're trying to have a 
comfortable classroom,

1165
01:09:38,311 --> 01:09:43,311
so that's kind of nice.
Decide if you decide if you want to take

1166
01:09:43,801 --> 01:09:46,080
the course because I don't want you to 
be disappointed that.

1167
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:47,933
So I'm really,
really telling you seriously to like 

1168
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,153
ideas.
If you like this lecture to like the 

1169
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:56,570
course and you got to do the reading and
there's a fair bit of free.

1170
01:09:57,510 --> 01:10:00,540
So
we'll see if there's.
