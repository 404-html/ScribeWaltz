1
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,740
I started to talk to you about trait
theory and now I'm going to make a jump

2
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:21,741
to biology and that's a strange jump in
some sense because the two levels of

3
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:26,901
analysis are relatively disconnected,
but what's happening right now at,

4
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,110
at the sort of outer echelons of
personality research is that

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,680
the workers at the forefront of the
field are trying to integrate what's

6
00:00:38,681 --> 00:00:42,640
been established at the statistical
level of analysis with what's known at

7
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:46,990
the psychobiological level.
And so this emerging science is known as

8
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:48,530
personality neuroscience and

9
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,283
um,

10
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,420
it's developed in a rather strange way
because

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,370
the trades that were identified that I
discussed with you on Tuesday,

12
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:04,371
the big five traits all emerged as a
consequence of this statistical analysis

13
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,060
of,
of descriptors characteristic mostly of

14
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:11,070
the English language.
Although it's been duplicated in other

15
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:16,071
languages.
So in some sense it was in a theoretical

16
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:17,310
model,
right?

17
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:22,311
It just came out of the linguistic data.
So there was no real initial inferences

18
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:27,360
about brain area or neurological
activity or,

19
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,620
or anything like that to drive the
formulation of the big five model.

20
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:33,390
And instead of the big five model came
first.

21
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,380
And then people started thinking,
okay,

22
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,120
can this be put into alignment with what
we know about the brain?

23
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,990
And so people have been hitting that
pretty hard,

24
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,940
I would say,
over about the last.

25
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,690
It's probably 30 years,
something like that because Hans,

26
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,170
I zinc and and his student,
Jeffrey Gray,

27
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:00,980
we're pretty far along on this kind of
thinking by say 1982 when gray published

28
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:04,260
his book,
the neuropsychology of anxiety,

29
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:09,261
which the paper you're reading now,
a model of the limbic system and Basal

30
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,020
Ganglia,
Basal Ganglia applications to anxiety

31
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:13,860
and schizophrenia.

32
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,200
That's a very short summary of the book.
That gray published in 1982,

33
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:24,201
which has been incredibly influential if
you're interested in going on in

34
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:26,400
psychology,
especially on the scientific end,

35
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:30,210
but I would say pretty much regardless
if you're interested in going on in

36
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:31,200
psychology,
that's a.

37
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,890
that's a very useful book to tackle.
There's a newer version that was

38
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:38,190
published by gray and Mcnaughton and I
think 2000,

39
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,740
something like that.
It's hard going like,

40
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:43,710
and you may have found the paper that
way to gray was a very,

41
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:46,050
very.
Unfortunately he died a few years ago.

42
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,430
He was a very,
very smart person and he knew the animal

43
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:52,110
literature on behavior,
neuro,

44
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:55,380
Adam,
neuroanatomy and neuropsychopharmacology

45
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:58,830
inside out and backwards,
and so whenever he defined a term,

46
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,820
he always made sure that the term was
intelligible at a behavioral level and

47
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:06,970
at an anatomical level and at a
pharmacological level.

48
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,270
It had to,
you know,

49
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,520
the ideas that he were developing had to
make sense that these multiple levels of

50
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:15,850
analysis before he would accept them as
as genuine and gray,

51
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:20,851
did a remarkable job of extending our
knowledge of the biological and the

52
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:26,641
evolutionary basis of at least the first
two personality traits say extroversion

53
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:29,290
and neuroticism,
roughly corresponding to positive and

54
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,330
negative emotion.
So I'm.

55
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,460
So that's partly why you're reading grey
and grey theories.

56
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:37,960
Also,
cybernetic theory.

57
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,180
Cybernetic theory is a,
is a variation of a theory developed by

58
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,000
an mit cognitive scientist named Norbert
Wiener,

59
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:50,740
who,
who was an early ai artificial

60
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:53,530
intelligence researcher,
and he proposed that,

61
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:59,350
that that intelligent entities were goal
directed and that they organized their

62
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:04,441
behavior around reducing deviations from
a goal while they were approaching it.

63
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:10,741
Once they had decided what it would be.
Now that's also proved to be incredibly

64
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,093
influential.

65
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,380
Um,
we'll talk a fair bit about cybernetic

66
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:18,460
models as we progress.
So gray is sort of a combination of

67
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:21,550
artificial intelligence,
cybernetic theorizing,

68
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,510
and then an incredible amount of data
that's come in from animal behavioral

69
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:27,430
research.
And as far as I'm concerned,

70
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:31,000
most of the things that we know about
the brain have been derived from animal

71
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:32,170
research.
Um,

72
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,230
the animal researchers tended to be
extraordinarily careful.

73
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:37,510
Scientists,
they were influenced by a,

74
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,680
a,
a,

75
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,460
b bf skinner who established the sort of
the initial

76
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,110
theoretical basis for understanding how
animals learn.

77
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:49,930
We'll talk about that a little bit next
class.

78
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,610
So anyways,
that's the,

79
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,850
that's the context within which gray is
working.

80
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,220
Ledoux,
these are all papers you're going to

81
00:04:57,221 --> 00:04:59,680
read except the third one,
which is optional.

82
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,050
Ledoux is also a,
an emotional.

83
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,190
He's an an affective neuroscientist.
So he's as someone who studies emotions

84
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,241
mostly,
again,

85
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:12,220
animals and do,
has done a lot to sort of add some of

86
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:14,560
the pieces that were missing in,
in gray.

87
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,980
Gray probably concentrated a little bit
too much on a brain area called the

88
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:20,620
hippocampus,
which is the brain area that sort of

89
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,700
lets you know if it's reasonable to be
calm where you're currently situated and

90
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:32,650
so what the hippocampus does in some
senses compare what it is that you want

91
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:36,640
to have happen with what is happening
and if the two things are the same,

92
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,260
then you're calm.
So it's a match mismatch detector and it

93
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:46,000
has access not only to memory,
but also to formulations of say the

94
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:48,300
desired future.
M

95
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,340
Swanson,
I had people read the Swanson paper last

96
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,840
year.
I've put it in your reading list is

97
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:59,510
optional.
It's worth hacking through if you can

98
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:01,460
manage it.
It's very hard paper though,

99
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,280
which is why it took it out of the
required reading list.

100
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,590
The reason I liked Swanson,
we're going to talk a fair bit about him

101
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:10,430
today is
Swanson's not a psychologist.

102
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,430
He's actually a developmental neuro.
I can never say this properly.

103
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:20,300
And uh,
he studies developmental anatomy.

104
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,350
We'll,
we'll do that.

105
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,170
Um,
and so he's very interested in how the

106
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:28,010
brain unfolds across time,
during embryonic development and then up

107
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:33,011
into maturity and so he understands the
brain differently than a psychologist

108
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,750
because the psychologist tends to
analyze the brain,

109
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,270
you know,
as a sort of mature thing usually in

110
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:39,104
adulthood,
but,

111
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,100
but for Swanson,
it's a much more living and transforming

112
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:48,101
system and he's trying to set forth a
Schema for understanding brain anatomy

113
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,760
and also associating that with function,
you know,

114
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:56,570
and you might think that that's a well
advanced science already that we know

115
00:06:56,571 --> 00:07:01,571
how to segment up to the brain and we
know roughly what the piece is due,

116
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:06,290
but we haven't even really managed to
establish the terminology pro property

117
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,100
yet.
It's very narrow.

118
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:13,510
Neuroscience is a very new field and,
and there's no limit to the number of

119
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:17,630
things that we don't know about it,
including even the basic classification

120
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:18,020
structure.

121
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,280
Now Swanson has put forth a very
intelligent basic classification

122
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:24,190
structure.
And part of the reason that I think it's

123
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:29,191
so relevant to a personality class is
because it maps in a beautiful way onto

124
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,870
some of the things that we've already
talked about,

125
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:36,230
especially piaget.
So there's a nice direct mapping of

126
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:41,231
Piaget's developmental theory onto
Swanson's theory of neurodevelopment and

127
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:44,930
then have neural function and that's
completely accidental because Swanson

128
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:48,440
never cites piaget so they're non
overlapping literatures and I kind of

129
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:50,180
liked that because you know,
if,

130
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,080
if something pops up in one place with
one method and pops up another place

131
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:58,070
with a completely different method,
especially if those two places are

132
00:07:58,071 --> 00:08:00,560
distinct in terms of their historical
development,

133
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,110
you might start thinking there's
actually something there.

134
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,060
You know,
it sort of like seeing something and

135
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:08,240
hearing it at the same time.
You've got two independent sources of

136
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:08,900
data.

137
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,890
It's like triangulation in a sense.
And so it was very exciting to me to

138
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:16,200
come across this paper by Swanson.
I'm like,

139
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,220
he's one of only two scientists I ever
wrote a fan letter too.

140
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,220
I mean really it's a brilliant paper.
And then

141
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,850
there's,
there's other reasons why it maps onto

142
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:29,060
what we're going to talk about too,
because Swanson also points out quite

143
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:33,290
clearly the function of the,
he's kind of roughly separates the

144
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:37,880
hypothalamus into two halves and uh,
he points out that they have quite

145
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:41,240
distinct functions and the functions
also map onto some of the things that

146
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:43,130
we've been talking about it in a very
lovely way.

147
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,050
And so there's a lot of reasons to,
to go through Swanson's paper carefully,

148
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,750
you know,
it's like 50 pages long,

149
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:55,160
but the guy put it in some senses,
whole life's work is in those 50 pages,

150
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,130
you know,
even if it takes you 12 hours or 20

151
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:01,560
hours to read it,
it's like that's not too bad if you're

152
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,130
going to extract out like 30 years of
solid research.

153
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,290
Gray's book is the same.
Like if you read that book you've got,

154
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:14,280
if you read it and understand it,
you've basically got a fair chunk of

155
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:19,230
neuroanatomy,
a lot of animal behavioral analysis.

156
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,530
So I'm behaviorism in general,
a lot of psychopharmacology and a lot of

157
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,040
understanding of the functional
significance of the brain's major

158
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:33,870
neurotransmitter systems.
You can get all that from gray's book,

159
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,310
that's,
that's a killer book,

160
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:37,020
you know,
if you can extract all that out.

161
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,340
So anyways,
carver and Scheier also take a

162
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:43,590
cybernetic perspective.
Fundamentally,

163
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:46,850
they're more cognitive scientists.
You're going to find their paper a

164
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,150
little bit farther down the road,
but they're also very interested in how

165
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,310
creatures human beings in particular
select goals and then align themselves

166
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:58,590
with those goals.
And for our purposes,

167
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:02,520
we're going to talk a fair bit about
motivation today and the distinction

168
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:04,980
between motivation and emotion is not
clear.

169
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,700
They're both words that sort of function
within an linguistic context,

170
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:12,630
but for the sake of argument,
and of course all the emotions aren't

171
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:14,850
the same.
It's not like there's one circuit that

172
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:17,580
subsumes emotion.
There's multiple circuits that subsume

173
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:20,400
emotion and they're not identical
circuits,

174
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:22,920
you know,
so it isn't like every emotion is a

175
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:25,320
variant of the same thing.
It's not.

176
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,010
It's the same with the motivation.
So they're very loose groupings,

177
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:33,060
motivation and emotion.
But for the purposes of our argument,

178
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:36,630
we're going to make this case roughly
motivations,

179
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,200
set goals,
and roughly emotions orient you in

180
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:44,490
relationship to those goals.
Now,

181
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:46,350
like I said,
those categories overlap.

182
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,770
Anger is usually considered an emotion
and it often has a goal,

183
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:52,050
right?
The goal is to hit something or hurt

184
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,550
something.
That's,

185
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:58,050
that's one possible goal,
so emotions can segway quite easily into

186
00:10:58,051 --> 00:10:59,880
motivational states,
but whatever.

187
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,500
You got to use a category system of some
sort to clear clarify things,

188
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:05,610
and so that's what we're going to.

189
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,480
We're going to a pursuit.
Motivations set goals.

190
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,850
It's actually more complicated than
that.

191
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,250
You know,
I showed you that little oval diagram

192
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:17,760
with a desired future and unbearable
present,

193
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,180
so to speak.
Motivations actually don't just set

194
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:25,200
goals.
They also prime behavior and they also

195
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:28,440
set up the perceptual frame within which
you interpret the world.

196
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,310
So for example,
if you're hungry and it isn't just that

197
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:34,860
you're driven to eat,
first of all,

198
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,130
eating is a very complex behavior,
especially if it's associated with food

199
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:42,150
preparation.
Say you're the systems that you've used

200
00:11:42,151 --> 00:11:47,151
in the past to procure food and then to
ingest it are sort of disinhibited by

201
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:51,330
the motivational state.
So they're at the ready and then your

202
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:55,630
sensory system is tuned so that it's
going to focus on those things that are

203
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,240
relevant to eating and tune out
everything else.

204
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,560
So the motivational state also does
perceptual tuning and then there's a

205
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:04,480
felt component of it as well.

206
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:09,160
So it's not,
it's not reasonable to only say that

207
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,850
motivation sets goals or that it drives
behavior.

208
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,590
It does three things,
goal setting,

209
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:18,580
behavioral driving,
plus it provides a perceptual schema

210
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:20,620
within which those other two things make
sense.

211
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,300
And so a motivated state in some sense
is like a little micro personality.

212
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,590
It's only got one aim.
It's sort of a one eyed micro

213
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:30,580
personality,
you know,

214
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:33,970
so it's only aiming at one thing,
but it still has all the other aspects

215
00:12:33,971 --> 00:12:35,650
of personality.
So

216
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,890
sort of,
you know,

217
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,050
for me that,
that aligns nicely with the

218
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,060
psychoanalytic idea that you know,
you're,

219
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,990
you're,
you're,

220
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:49,410
you're a loose aggregation of multiple
fragmented personalities,

221
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:51,790
you know,
there's Sorta coherently tied together

222
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,550
at the highest level of analysis,
but they can go off and do their own

223
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:56,290
thing.
You see that in situations,

224
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:59,110
for example,
like eating disorders where the hunger

225
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:03,940
system itself starts to become almost a
spun off part of the personality and the

226
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:04,840
rest of the personality.

227
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,190
Then wars with that and that sort of in
some sense that's like cortex versus

228
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:13,600
hypothalamus and you never win.
CORTEX does not win over hypothalamus.

229
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:15,340
The hypothalamus is what keeps you
alive,

230
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,490
so it's one of the things that keeps you
alive.

231
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:21,250
You could do without your cortex,
but you cannot do without your

232
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:25,060
hypothalamus and the connections
stretching upwards from the

233
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:27,310
hypothalamus,
which is a very old brain area,

234
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,840
are much more powerful than the
connections coming down from the Cortex

235
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:35,020
to modulate the hypothalamus.
And that's another indication of just

236
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:37,300
exactly who's in charge when the chips
are down.

237
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,100
You know,
and that's why it's so hard for you to

238
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:42,670
override your basic emotions or
motivational states.

239
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,350
It's like the system evolved to keep you
alive and it's not particularly willing

240
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:52,351
to give up control in a sense given that
your survival is staked on its function.

241
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,350
So
it's useful to know that because you

242
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,751
know,
if you,

243
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:57,584
if you,
if you,

244
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,720
if you pursue psychology and you stay
within the human side of psychology,

245
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,930
say instead of wandering off into the
animal behavioral research,

246
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:10,060
you'll see that most human psychologists
and neuropsychologists are very cortical

247
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:12,250
centric.
They really like to think that it's the

248
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:16,270
newly evolved parts of the brain that
are in charge and that's just not right.

249
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:21,510
The newly evolved parts of the brain are
in charge only when nothing is bothering

250
00:14:21,731 --> 00:14:23,440
you.
Like if you're not hungry,

251
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:25,750
you're not thirsty,
you're not too excited,

252
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:28,030
you're not too curious.
You're not too terrified.

253
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,300
You know you're not too cold,
not too warm any of those,

254
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,720
then the cortex is in charge.
But if you deviate substantially across

255
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:40,900
any of those dimensions,
the probability that control over your

256
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:44,230
behavioral output in your perceptions is
going to devolve down.

257
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:48,400
The evolutionary hierarchy to more
primordial brain areas is extremely

258
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:49,440
likely.
You know,

259
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,680
when you see the same thing happens,
you know,

260
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:53,540
maybe you're having a discussion with
someone,

261
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,960
right?
And they exhaust the limits of your

262
00:14:56,961 --> 00:15:00,170
rational knowledge,
which means basically they out argue you

263
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,550
well,
what happens?

264
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,630
Well usually what happens is that people
cry or they get angry and it's like

265
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,170
they're out of cortex.
It's bang right down to the more,

266
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,370
the lower and more primary
evolutionarily determined systems.

267
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,660
So,
okay,

268
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:16,590
now we're gonna.
We're gonna.

269
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:20,390
Take a look at how the brain functions
in general and so we're going to start

270
00:15:20,391 --> 00:15:22,130
pretty general and then we're going to
go narrow.

271
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,320
And the first thing that you might want
to think about is what problem exactly

272
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:32,321
is the brain wrestling with.
And the major problem is that reality is

273
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:37,070
so complicated,
it has so many layers and so many

274
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,520
interconnected causal links that it's
complex beyond comprehension.

275
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,290
And that's a big problem.
I mean,

276
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,690
you think about all the subatomic
complexity,

277
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,470
that's a horrible thing.
Then there's the complexity at the

278
00:15:51,471 --> 00:15:53,250
atomic level and that's,
you know,

279
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,610
pretty overwhelming.
And then there's the molecular level

280
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:57,710
which makes the atomic level looks
simple.

281
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,870
And then there's all the comp
exceedingly complex structures that

282
00:16:02,871 --> 00:16:05,810
emerge out of the molecular level,
especially in living organisms.

283
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:08,750
So that would be roughly at the organ
level of existence,

284
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:11,360
you know,
and then there's you as a totality with

285
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:12,890
your brain,
which is,

286
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:16,820
and the brain is so much more complex
than everything else in the universe

287
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:20,270
that it's not even in the same category.
So there are estimates,

288
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,830
for example,
by Gerald Edelman,

289
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:23,840
that there are more connections in your
brain,

290
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:27,680
more patterns of connections in your
brain than there are subatomic particles

291
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:29,120
in the universe.
So,

292
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,490
you know,
that's one major league complex thing

293
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,620
and there's lots of them around and you
know,

294
00:16:33,621 --> 00:16:36,860
they're all integrated into families.

295
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,210
And then,
uh,

296
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,600
you know,
roughly tribal grouping,

297
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,700
some of which get large enough to be
nations.

298
00:16:43,701 --> 00:16:47,030
And then that's all embedded inside of
some biological system.

299
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:50,750
And so on and so forth,
all the way out to the limits of the

300
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:51,590
cosmos.
I mean,

301
00:16:51,591 --> 00:16:55,190
this is one complicated place and you
know,

302
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,640
your job in large part is to understand
it,

303
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:03,020
but also not to become overwhelmed by it
because you have to simplify it down to

304
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:06,710
the point where you can sort of think
about one thing and do one thing.

305
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,980
And so you have to screen all of that
out so that the complexity complexity

306
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,460
doesn't overwhelm you when you're
attempting to do anything,

307
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,640
anything simple even to look at yourself
in the mirror,

308
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,070
which is also a very complicated thing
to do.

309
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:27,230
Part of the problem your brain is,
is always facing is

310
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,470
what can I ignore?

311
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,360
And the answer to that is,
well,

312
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:33,970
you need to ignore almost everything.
And,

313
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:36,350
and that's,
that's a problem because of course it's

314
00:17:36,351 --> 00:17:40,490
not always obvious what it's okay,
what's okay for you to ignore,

315
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,250
you know,
and that changes on you suddenly too

316
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,800
because you know,
because you have imperfect knowledge,

317
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:49,070
you may think something's irrelevant and
it turns out to be of critical.

318
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:53,610
So it's a deadly,
deadly difficult problems.

319
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,970
And so one of the ways that we solve
this is we're actually pretty blind to,

320
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,900
to,
to almost everything.

321
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:05,310
You know,
our sensory input is limited by our

322
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:07,320
physiological limitations,
certainly.

323
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:09,410
So there's like,
in terms of visions,

324
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,260
we only see a very small,
a little slice of the whole

325
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:16,260
electromagnetic spectrum.
And it's the same with sounds.

326
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,330
And you know,
we can only touch things that are

327
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:22,060
basically within our reach.
And so that limits things substantially.

328
00:18:22,061 --> 00:18:24,120
And then there are also things we can't
detect,

329
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:26,910
like we're not very good at detecting.
I'm like,

330
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:31,830
we don't have the same ability that say
a platypuses and some fish can detect

331
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:34,200
electromagnetic disturbances around
them,

332
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,200
on their skin and like their senses that
we don't have.

333
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,010
So we're,
we're narrowed a fair bit by what it is

334
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:42,950
that we're able to perceive.
Um,

335
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:48,110
and we're actually narrowed in what we
can perceive far more than anybody ever.

336
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:49,770
Guests.
So I'm going to show you a little video

337
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:50,604
here.

338
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:56,630
The monkey business illusion
count how many times the players wearing

339
00:18:57,331 --> 00:19:02,331
white pass the ball.
The correct answer is 16 passes.

340
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:41,350
Did you spot the gorilla
for people who haven't seen or heard

341
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:45,310
about a video like this before,
about half miss the gorilla.

342
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,920
If you knew about the gorilla,
you probably saw it,

343
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,700
but did you notice the curtain changing
color or the player on the black team

344
00:19:54,701 --> 00:19:59,701
leaving the game?
Let's rewind and watch it again.

345
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,390
Here comes the gorilla and there goes a
player.

346
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,610
And the curtain is changing from red to
gold.

347
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,520
When you're looking for a gorilla,
you often miss other unexpected events.

348
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,720
And that's the monkey business illusion.
Learn more about this illusion and the

349
00:20:28,321 --> 00:20:31,860
original gorilla
experiment@theinvisiblegorilla.com.

350
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,240
So how many of you saw the gorilla?
Let's,

351
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,800
let's do the.
Okay.

352
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,980
How many of you had not known about this
video beforehand?

353
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,160
Yeah.
The gorilla part of it.

354
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,920
Yeah.
So you guys don't count now.

355
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:48,850
And then you know,
I get someone who's seen it before and

356
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:51,070
they still miss the damn gorilla.
So that's pretty funny.

357
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,360
So,
but,

358
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,960
but of course,
Simon then Simon set this up because his

359
00:20:55,961 --> 00:21:00,580
original video got so popular,
virally popular that everybody has seen

360
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:04,330
the invisible gorilla.
And so now he's showing you that while

361
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,640
you think you're smart,
you've been clued in to how blind you

362
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,320
are.
And it turns out you're not any smarter

363
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:09,580
than you were to begin with.
Right?

364
00:21:09,581 --> 00:21:12,850
So how many people saw all three things
that changed?

365
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,740
Oh,
you've seen it before.

366
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:16,161
So.
Okay.

367
00:21:16,161 --> 00:21:17,120
And how many didn't?

368
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:18,841
Yeah.
Okay.

369
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:22,650
So the vast majority of you missed one
or more of the things that changed now

370
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,850
in the not really trivial things like
the disappearance of a person from six

371
00:21:26,851 --> 00:21:30,870
people that's fairly major and you know
the whole background changed color and

372
00:21:30,871 --> 00:21:33,420
you might think you'd clue into that and
so.

373
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:38,250
So the weird thing is even when you're
primed to notice what you're supposed to

374
00:21:38,251 --> 00:21:41,250
notice,
which is to say count the balls and you

375
00:21:41,251 --> 00:21:43,170
know that something weird is going to
happen,

376
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,900
you're not.
That still doesn't prime you enough so

377
00:21:45,901 --> 00:21:49,530
that you can keep track of all the weird
things that are happening and like this

378
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:53,740
was an absolutely staggering experiment.
When when it was first shown people,

379
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:58,170
the psychologists were just like knocked
over by it because the hypothesis up to

380
00:21:58,171 --> 00:22:02,130
that point had been always that you
could concentrate on what you were

381
00:22:02,131 --> 00:22:02,850
concentrating on.

382
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,310
But if something anomalous or unexpected
happened,

383
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,890
your attention would be automatically
devoted towards it.

384
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:09,420
And of course that's what people would
think,

385
00:22:09,421 --> 00:22:11,040
right?
You'd think that if you're watching

386
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:16,041
people play basketball and a gorilla
walks into the area and it's not small,

387
00:22:17,731 --> 00:22:21,240
that of course you'd be surprised and
you'd see it if it turns out that that's

388
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:22,510
just wrong.
And you know,

389
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,650
it tells you a lot about how your
nervous system is set up.

390
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:30,660
So you're focusing on counting the Baltz
and so for some reason getting the

391
00:22:30,661 --> 00:22:34,250
correct answer to the question,
how many times are the,

392
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,560
is the ball thrown back and forth?
It turns out to be motivationally

393
00:22:37,561 --> 00:22:38,910
significant.
Why?

394
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,420
Like what,
why?

395
00:22:41,421 --> 00:22:42,370
Why did you,
you know,

396
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,030
you've got the instructions.
Fair enough.

397
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:49,031
But why did you listen to them?
Oh sure it does.

398
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:53,090
But the question is why did you even
comply with the instructions?

399
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,990
Yeah.
Who said that?

400
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,640
Because he wanted to get the answer
right.

401
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,400
Why did you care if you got the answer
right?

402
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,160
Well,
think about it for a minute.

403
00:23:06,161 --> 00:23:09,870
Like what gets me?

404
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,361
Yeah,
that's right.

405
00:23:11,361 --> 00:23:13,760
So that's one possibility.
It's like instantly you sort of

406
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:17,810
interpreted as a little cognitive task
maybe and then you want to see if you

407
00:23:17,811 --> 00:23:20,990
can do it.
And so that taps into your hierarchy of

408
00:23:20,991 --> 00:23:23,450
values,
part of your value is I want to be maybe

409
00:23:23,451 --> 00:23:27,500
a smart and competent person or I want
to be at least as smart and competent as

410
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:30,310
everyone else is playing this game.
And so you know,

411
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,980
the instruction taps into a preexistent
value structure and then it's

412
00:23:33,981 --> 00:23:34,880
motivating.
Okay.

413
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:37,820
So what compliance as well?
Yes,

414
00:23:37,821 --> 00:23:41,750
that's another thing.
It's like the room in some ways is set

415
00:23:41,751 --> 00:23:44,780
up to ensure a degree of compliance,
right?

416
00:23:44,781 --> 00:23:47,240
Because an,
there's an implicit story in the room

417
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:51,200
which is if I'm at the front of it.
And so that sort of makes me at the top

418
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:54,440
of the dominance hierarchy and the fact
that you're here means you've already

419
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:58,460
bought into that presupposition.
And so it's a logical thing to do to

420
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:00,940
play along with the game.
So yes,

421
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,920
true that that's more like the playing a
game issue,

422
00:24:08,921 --> 00:24:09,490
right?
Is that.

423
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,320
Well,
maybe something interesting will happen.

424
00:24:11,321 --> 00:24:12,430
Okay.
Right,

425
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,331
right,
right.

426
00:24:13,331 --> 00:24:15,130
Okay.
So there's a variety of reasons why you

427
00:24:15,131 --> 00:24:18,850
might listen to the instructions,
but the point is the instructions

428
00:24:18,851 --> 00:24:23,170
actually tap into your motivation in
your intrinsic motivation enough.

429
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:28,380
So that you will in fact attempt to play
the game and then as soon as you play

430
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:32,320
the game,
what happens while you focus your very

431
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:36,400
limited attentional resources precisely
on what it is that you're supposed to

432
00:24:36,401 --> 00:24:38,350
do.
Now we could talk a little bit about how

433
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,570
the visual field is set up.
So you know,

434
00:24:40,571 --> 00:24:43,780
you notice that like if I'm looking
around the room,

435
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,420
if I want to see you,
all of you,

436
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,290
I can't just stand here and look
straight ahead because all you people

437
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:54,010
over here,
you're like I can't see if I'm looking

438
00:24:54,011 --> 00:24:54,520
straight ahead.

439
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,520
I can't see the faces of anyone past
here and I can only see them sort of as

440
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:04,900
blurs and unless they move and if they
move up something then I can see the

441
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:05,890
movement.
But I can't.

442
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:09,340
It's not clear to me what's moving.
And it's the same for the people over

443
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,990
here.
The only person I can really see right

444
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:14,680
now is the woman who's sitting there in
the white sweater.

445
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:18,280
All the rest of you are like the person
to the right.

446
00:25:18,281 --> 00:25:20,230
I can more or less as long as I look at
her.

447
00:25:20,231 --> 00:25:23,530
I could more or less see that he's
dressed in gray,

448
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,590
but I can't see his face at all.
Now.

449
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,280
He nodded his head and I can pick that
up.

450
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:31,630
So what's very strange about your visual
system and your sensory systems are like

451
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:35,560
this in,
in you know all your sensory systems are

452
00:25:35,561 --> 00:25:38,710
like this,
is that you have a tiny little point of

453
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:43,711
focus where the information is rich and
that's partly because so the center of

454
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,170
your eye is the full view and it's most
densely.

455
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,030
It's most densely packed with cells,
but more importantly each of the cells

456
00:25:52,031 --> 00:25:54,310
in your phobia,
which is the very center of your vision.

457
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:58,540
You can tell when someone's pointing
their full view for via at you because

458
00:25:58,541 --> 00:26:01,750
then you have the sense that they're
looking at you and human beings are

459
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:06,751
unbelievably good at figuring out when
someone is pointing their phobia at u of

460
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,170
w we can.
We can detect I,

461
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,710
what would you call it?
Deviation from direct gaze with an

462
00:26:14,711 --> 00:26:18,520
accuracy that's absolutely remarkable.
Now each of those little cells in the

463
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:21,260
phobia is connected.
Each of the one sells.

464
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:26,200
It's connected to like 20,000 cells at
the first level of the hierarchy of the

465
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:31,201
visual system and so the reason that
your whole high isn't for vs [inaudible]

466
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:33,760
your head would have to be this big to
manage it.

467
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:37,480
So
what's evolved is sort of a compromise

468
00:26:37,481 --> 00:26:42,160
is that in the center of your vision,
it's the center of your vision is very,

469
00:26:42,161 --> 00:26:47,161
very detailed and then what you do is
you zip that center around like snap,

470
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:48,631
snap,
snap,

471
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:49,231
snap,
snap,

472
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:52,620
snap,
and your brain sorta makes a amalgamated

473
00:26:52,621 --> 00:26:55,260
picture out of all those little
snapshots and you know,

474
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,610
then it weaves it together.

475
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:01,610
So it seems to you like it's a
continuous one continuous movie of

476
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:03,840
consciousness even though it's really
not.

477
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:07,680
And then the sides of your eyes,
the periphery of your eyes,

478
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:12,060
well they don't have the same potency as
the full via and so they,

479
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,120
they kind of play a triage game.
It's like,

480
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,550
okay,
I can't see if I'm looking straight

481
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:18,900
ahead.
I can't see everything.

482
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:24,210
What might I use as an indication that I
should move my gaze from where I'm

483
00:27:24,211 --> 00:27:27,120
looking to somewhere else?
And one answer to that is movement.

484
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:31,260
So the periphery is pretty good at
picking up movement and so often if you

485
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:34,620
see movement in the periphery,
then you'll move your full vision to

486
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:37,260
where the movement was and then you
know,

487
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,200
then you can keep track of what's
changing.

488
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,760
So what your brain sort of assumes is
that when you're looking at something,

489
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:50,570
everything else is irrelevant and it's
also,

490
00:27:50,611 --> 00:27:52,590
it also sort of fades into the
background.

491
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,960
And so that's what's happening with the
gorilla video.

492
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,590
And so the part of the reason you can't
see the damn gorilla is because he's

493
00:27:58,591 --> 00:28:02,100
dressed in black like the players.
And so when you're focusing on the

494
00:28:02,101 --> 00:28:06,240
basketball,
all the block moving things look the

495
00:28:06,241 --> 00:28:08,040
same,
you know,

496
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:09,840
there's no distinction between them at
all.

497
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,810
And then the background of the curtain,
it's like,

498
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:17,811
well first of all,
why would you be primed to see the

499
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:21,420
curtain changing color?
Like things just don't do that in real

500
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:22,231
life,
right?

501
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:25,290
I mean,
big objects don't suddenly change color

502
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,400
very,
very seldomly.

503
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:27,800
So and,
but,

504
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:31,590
and more importantly,
the fact that the gorilla shows up,

505
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,870
the fact that one player leaves and the
fact that the curtains change color has

506
00:28:36,871 --> 00:28:39,840
no bearing whatsoever on whether or not
you can complete the task.

507
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,230
Right?
So it doesn't matter if you ignore the

508
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:48,231
information and that's because it's
irrelevant in terms of the interpretive

509
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:50,220
frame,
the motivated interpretive frame that

510
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:51,510
you're applying to the scene.

511
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:56,280
And so the rule for perception is don't
pay attention to anything that isn't

512
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:58,110
directly relevant to the desired
outcome.

513
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:03,350
Now exactly how you calculate what you
can pay attention to and what you can't.

514
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,730
That's very complicated.
It's,

515
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,970
I mean,
you build that knowledge bit by bit over

516
00:29:08,971 --> 00:29:12,480
time and you can be wrong about it too.
But,

517
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:13,890
um,
so,

518
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,570
so the old idea was,
you know,

519
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:20,400
well first of all that you were very
much conscious of the environment

520
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,840
period,
which you're not.

521
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:25,290
And then the second idea was,
well,

522
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,510
while you're being conscious of the
environment,

523
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:31,320
if anything changes radically,
you will definitely focus your attention

524
00:29:31,321 --> 00:29:33,540
on it.
And then,

525
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,720
and what turned out to be the case is,
well,

526
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:39,660
you're not very conscious of the
environment and radical things can

527
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:43,000
happen and you won't notice unless they
interfere with what you're doing.

528
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,560
So something that emerges that
interferes with what you're doing that

529
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:50,290
you don't expect,
you will instantly orient towards and

530
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:51,124
concentrate on.

531
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:55,720
So it isn't anomaly or novelty that
attracts your attention.

532
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:00,700
It's the unexpected disruption of the
relationship between your behaviors and

533
00:30:00,701 --> 00:30:04,630
the desired outcome of those behaviors.
And that's a much narrower claim.

534
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:07,660
Only pay attention to things that make
you fail.

535
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,220
It's something like that,
or at least additionally,

536
00:30:12,221 --> 00:30:14,170
pay attention to things that make you
fail.

537
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,000
And you know,
generally speaking,

538
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,300
that's also associated with an emotional
response.

539
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:22,300
You know,
so if you're doing something and you

540
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,490
think you know how to do it,
and so you're doing it and then all of a

541
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:27,520
sudden something unexpected happens,
you're going to have an emotional

542
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:29,920
reaction.
And we'll talk more about the emotional

543
00:30:29,921 --> 00:30:33,940
reactions in the next class.
But the emotional reaction partly

544
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:37,780
prepares you for the worst in case this
unexpected thing is bigger than you

545
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:40,030
think it is.
And sort of also primes you to be

546
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:43,510
curious and to start to explore to
figure out what it is so that you can

547
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,980
reconstruct your expectations and
desires in accordance with the

548
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:50,380
transforming world.
So

549
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:57,510
this slide is an elaboration in some
sense of what I was telling you a little

550
00:30:57,511 --> 00:31:01,980
bit earlier about the multiple levels of
reality and also the idea is that the

551
00:31:01,981 --> 00:31:04,560
thing that you see,
which in this particular schema would be

552
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:09,450
the computer,
how is nested inside all of these

553
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:12,510
systems or has other systems nested
inside of it.

554
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,210
And that's part of an indication of the
complexity of things.

555
00:31:15,211 --> 00:31:18,480
Now,
one of the things that you might think

556
00:31:18,481 --> 00:31:19,320
about,
for example,

557
00:31:19,321 --> 00:31:20,700
if you're using your computer,

558
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:27,120
one of the things you might ask yourself
is why is your computer a black

559
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:30,690
rectangle or a like a silver rectangle?
It's all smooth and shiny.

560
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:35,780
Why is that?
You know,

561
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:38,660
like it's not clear first it's not
transparent.

562
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,270
Okay.
And then it's got this smooth cover and

563
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,790
it wouldn't necessarily have to.
Why?

564
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:45,560
Why do you think that's appealing to
you?

565
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,280
Okay,
so it's familiar.

566
00:31:51,281 --> 00:31:53,020
Yeah.
And that that's good.

567
00:31:53,021 --> 00:31:57,160
So it's familiar.
What else is simple?

568
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,300
Yeah,
you don't want to.

569
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:02,200
You don't want to interact with the
computer at all.

570
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,740
You wanted to attract with little
pictures on the screen and then you

571
00:32:05,741 --> 00:32:07,540
don't even really want to interact with
those.

572
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,530
You want to interact with some subset of
what that picture is doing on the screen

573
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:14,980
and so you're very,
very rarely using the computer.

574
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,680
You're just paying attention to,
well,

575
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:22,390
let's say the screen and the keyboard,
so the computer is whatever's underneath

576
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:24,730
that and then what?
What that is is a collection of parts

577
00:32:24,731 --> 00:32:27,460
that are so bloody complicated that you
don't want to have anything to do with

578
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:31,450
them that are nested inside a whole
network of things that are so complex.

579
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:32,830
You don't want to have anything to do
with them.

580
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:35,320
And so,
so you know what happens when you're

581
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,720
using a computer is all of a sudden it
stops working.

582
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:41,360
Well then it's a computer.
As soon as it stops working,

583
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:44,450
it's a computer.
Before that it was whatever it was you

584
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:47,180
were doing and as soon as it turns into
a computer,

585
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,560
what do you do with it?
Well,

586
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,090
you know,
stupidly hit the on and off button and

587
00:32:53,091 --> 00:32:58,091
maybe plug it in and out or something
and maybe you checked your switches to

588
00:32:58,881 --> 00:33:03,500
make sure that a fuse didn't burn out or
a breaker go and that's pretty much the

589
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:08,030
end of you in terms of your ability to
deal with the actual entity and then you

590
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:13,190
curse with your primate brain and then
you send it out to be fixed.

591
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:18,610
And so one of the things that's that's
worth considering because this will also

592
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:23,360
help us understand what happens in terms
of brain function as we go along,

593
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:27,920
is that as long as things are going
according to how you want them to go,

594
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,920
you can really pretend that the world is
unbelievably simple.

595
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,970
All the world consists of is those few
things that you're doing in your little

596
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:39,740
bounded perceptual frame and everything
else is zero.

597
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:45,350
And then unfortunately now and then the
hypothesis that everything else is zero

598
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,850
is radically wrong.
Like when your computer crashes and then

599
00:33:49,851 --> 00:33:53,690
you have actually actually for awhile
have to deal with at least some of the

600
00:33:53,691 --> 00:33:57,410
complexity that's actually there.
And that's usually extremely anxiety

601
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,080
provoking.
So you know,

602
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:04,081
you can imagine the same situation is
while you're in your nice smooth car and

603
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,410
you're on the highway and all of a
sudden you know you hear a horrible

604
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:09,080
grinding noise and smoke comes out of
the back and you're,

605
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:12,020
you're off pulled over to the side.
Well,

606
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,300
what was merely a means of getting from
point a to B and comfort like two

607
00:34:17,301 --> 00:34:21,200
seconds ago is now a collection of
extremely troublesome parts,

608
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:25,280
none of which you know anything about.
Plus it's disrupted your day.

609
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:29,390
Plus it's disrupted your pocket book.
Plus you have to now deal with a bunch

610
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:32,510
of people who are going to tell you
what's wrong with your vehicle and maybe

611
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:37,511
fix it for some completely unknown
amount of money and with dubious

612
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:39,620
utility.
And so poof,

613
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:41,780
the car turns into that.
And so it's,

614
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:48,530
it's almost impossible to overestimate
the degree to which we live within a

615
00:34:48,531 --> 00:34:53,531
world that's bounded by our expectations
and desires and how much time we spend

616
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:01,010
keeping everything that's complex away
from us so that we don't have to deal

617
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:01,551
with it.
Okay?

618
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:04,370
So now we might want to think about how
we do that.

619
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:09,200
I'm going to show you,
this is the little Schema that might be

620
00:35:09,201 --> 00:35:11,090
helpful.
So like

621
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:19,620
I made this little diagram of dots
because I wanted to make an ambiguous

622
00:35:19,621 --> 00:35:22,740
figure.
So I'm hoping that when you look at that

623
00:35:22,741 --> 00:35:25,770
figure,
what do you see when you look at it?

624
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:37,270
The center and what shape is the center?
Cross.

625
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,040
Okay.
So you can see

626
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,450
across.
What else can you see?

627
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,650
It's a rectangle.
Yeah.

628
00:35:42,651 --> 00:35:45,500
What else can you see?
It's four squares.

629
00:35:45,501 --> 00:35:46,191
Yeah,
exactly.

630
00:35:46,191 --> 00:35:51,191
So what else can you see?
That's a good one.

631
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,860
I haven't seen that one.
I'll take your word for it though.

632
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:04,550
What else can you see?
I'll show you some of the things you can

633
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:05,694
see.
Okay.

634
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:10,500
You see that right?
See that?

635
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:17,310
See that?
You could see that.

636
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,650
You can see that.
Okay.

637
00:36:22,651 --> 00:36:25,920
So the first thing that you might note
is that

638
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,610
the thing in the beginning,
the thing in itself,

639
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:34,611
let's say you can see multiple ways.
It's not exactly that.

640
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:37,770
You have an opinion about what it is you
know,

641
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,080
it's the.
You can actually see those different

642
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:43,320
things.
You can see it manifesting those

643
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:47,700
different perceptual objects and that
that's a strange thing because you know

644
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:51,090
how people always think that arguments
are about opinions.

645
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,930
There some facts and you have one set of
opinions about them and you have

646
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:56,760
another,
and then you argue about the opinions

647
00:36:56,761 --> 00:37:00,000
until you get to the facts.
Unfortunately it's a lot worse than that

648
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:05,001
because the facts themselves are often
reasonably subject to debate.

649
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:09,090
So you.
So you might ask for example,

650
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:13,920
which of the five ways that you could
see that initial thing is the right way

651
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:14,754
to see it.

652
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,270
And the answer to that,
and this is a pragmatic answer,

653
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:21,580
is it depends on what you want to do
with your perception.

654
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,800
You know,
so if you want to,

655
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:29,860
if you want the highest resolution that
captures as much detail as possible,

656
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:33,040
then you want something as close to the
thing in itself as possible.

657
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:37,900
So that probably be object five there.
If you want to know the rough area,

658
00:37:37,901 --> 00:37:41,140
let's say that's a map of an orchard,
you might think about object one.

659
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,770
If it's an orchard from the top right
and you wanted to walk from north to

660
00:37:44,771 --> 00:37:46,780
south,
you might want to think about it in

661
00:37:46,781 --> 00:37:50,560
terms of object three,
so those are different ways you can

662
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:54,760
perceive that object and then I would
say that what happens at the next level

663
00:37:54,761 --> 00:37:58,360
of abstraction and that's where you've
got the numbers and words down here is

664
00:37:58,361 --> 00:38:02,320
that you have the thing in itself which
is complex and can be seen in many ways.

665
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,000
Then you have the things you see which
are partial sort of low resolution

666
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:12,001
representations of the thing itself and
then there are words which are at least

667
00:38:12,341 --> 00:38:15,340
in part references to the image of the
thing.

668
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,580
And so by the time you get to the word
it's pretty compressed.

669
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,760
And I really liked the metaphor of
compression,

670
00:38:21,761 --> 00:38:24,160
you know,
so because a lot of the things you see

671
00:38:24,161 --> 00:38:27,550
are sort of like thumbnails and why our
thumbnails useful.

672
00:38:27,551 --> 00:38:31,180
You guys have done some image
processing.

673
00:38:31,181 --> 00:38:36,181
Say like obviously a thumbnail lacks
things that a 16 megabyte is that about

674
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:39,760
right now?
How big are cameras?

675
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,970
Sixteen megabytes for a single photo.

676
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,053
What's that?

677
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,201
Yeah,
well,

678
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:49,480
I think the new cameras are up.
I think they're up to 16.

679
00:38:49,481 --> 00:38:50,500
The newest iteration.
So.

680
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:53,350
Okay,
so why have thumbnail if you have a 16

681
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:54,580
megabyte picture?

682
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,220
Okay.
But why not use the picture?

683
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,410
Right?
That's exactly it is that there's a

684
00:39:03,411 --> 00:39:08,411
tradeoff between detailed representation
and time utilization time and resource

685
00:39:09,711 --> 00:39:12,260
utilization and you know like,
like a computer,

686
00:39:12,261 --> 00:39:16,100
you guys have limited time and resources
and so you don't actually want to see

687
00:39:16,101 --> 00:39:19,910
any more than you need to see in order
to get what you're supposed to get done

688
00:39:19,911 --> 00:39:22,370
done because otherwise it's just a waste
of energy.

689
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,850
And so what that means is that your
brain is always trying to figure out in

690
00:39:25,851 --> 00:39:30,851
some sense what's the simplest way I can
represent this so that I can undertake

691
00:39:31,071 --> 00:39:33,080
whatever it is that I'm planning to
undertake next.

692
00:39:33,081 --> 00:39:34,160
And that sort of,
again,

693
00:39:34,161 --> 00:39:37,040
from a philosophical perspective,
that's actually something pragmatic.

694
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,960
Okay.
So then you might ask yourself,

695
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,880
you organize your perceptions in
relationship to your goals and then you

696
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:44,691
might ask yourself,
well,

697
00:39:44,691 --> 00:39:46,100
where do those goals come from?

698
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:51,320
And when we've heard from thinkers like
say Freud who talked about the IED

699
00:39:51,321 --> 00:39:55,460
functions in the Ed is sort of the seat
of primordial impulses.

700
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:57,090
Right?
And so you might,

701
00:39:57,091 --> 00:40:02,091
you might think about the Ed as the
producer of primary goals or drives and

702
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:04,410
for.
I didn't think about them as drive,

703
00:40:04,411 --> 00:40:06,770
so they were things that led to,
you know,

704
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:11,771
a relatively rigid behavioral algorithm
once the state had arisen.

705
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,620
Now,
as I mentioned before,

706
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,360
I think that that's a flawed viewpoint
because the motivational state is more

707
00:40:20,361 --> 00:40:24,710
than merely a drive because the drive is
something that say triggers a

708
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,970
preprogrammed sequence of behaviors.
And a lot of the early behaviorists

709
00:40:28,971 --> 00:40:30,750
thought about animal behavior in that
way,

710
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:32,210
right?
They'd say the animal encounter a

711
00:40:32,211 --> 00:40:36,590
stimulus and the stimulus would produce
a response and then the responses would

712
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,620
get chained together.
And then when the animal encounter the

713
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:43,400
stimulus again,
then just those change responses would

714
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:44,510
automatically run.

715
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:49,420
And one of the famous experiments that
showed that that was wrong was a rad,

716
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,280
was trained to run through a maze.
You can sort of train your out pretty

717
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:55,400
quickly if you know you,
you put them in the maze and there's

718
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:58,730
like he can go this way or this way and
you put some cheese over here,

719
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,460
you do that three or four times the rat
learns to turn right.

720
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,890
And then you add another piece to the
maze and you know,

721
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:07,070
then the rat learns to turn left.
And so you can get it turning,

722
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,530
you know,
extremely in an extremely complicated

723
00:41:09,531 --> 00:41:13,430
way to walk through the maze.
But then what they did was they took a

724
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:16,580
rat and they wrapped up its hind legs,
you know,

725
00:41:16,581 --> 00:41:18,800
like with tape,
so it couldn't use them.

726
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:23,360
And then they put little rear end on a
cart and then they had the little rat

727
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:25,520
scoot through the maze on the cart.

728
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,030
And it's obvious that a scooting route
and a running route don't use the same

729
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:30,770
motor output,
not even close.

730
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,600
And the rat could still get through the
maze.

731
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:35,960
So idea that all the rat had done was
chained together,

732
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:40,010
learned automatic responses,
turned out to be wrong.

733
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,290
Rats,
it's more like rats,

734
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,740
learn what's going on and can generalize
from it just like you do so.

735
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,181
So anyway.
So,

736
00:41:47,181 --> 00:41:52,181
so the notion that the drive just
instantiates a sequence of preprogram

737
00:41:52,401 --> 00:41:55,430
behaviors in most cases,
in many cases,

738
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:58,220
especially with complex behavior,
it turns out to be wrong.

739
00:41:58,221 --> 00:42:00,770
There are some limited circumstances
under which it's right.

740
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,970
Okay,
so the first hypothesis we're going to

741
00:42:04,971 --> 00:42:09,110
entertain is the idea that you have to
frame the world in order to interact

742
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:10,020
with it.
And this is sort of a little

743
00:42:10,021 --> 00:42:13,040
mythological diagram that I whipped up a
long time ago,

744
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,220
and the bottom thing that's a neuro bros
by the way,

745
00:42:16,221 --> 00:42:18,110
which is a dragon that eats its own
tail.

746
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:23,000
It's an ancient symbol of chaos and
chaos is what you see when you don't

747
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:25,310
know what you're looking at.
And so you could say,

748
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:28,580
in some sense,
chaos is all the complexity that

749
00:42:28,581 --> 00:42:29,630
surrounds you,

750
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,453
that

751
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:35,320
could possibly intrude on your little
safe world.

752
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,793
And then

753
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:40,260
to grasp that chaos also to operate
within it,

754
00:42:40,261 --> 00:42:44,010
you have to put it within a framework
and so that's the great father there.

755
00:42:44,011 --> 00:42:48,120
That's actually God you see God's got
the sun behind him because God is the

756
00:42:48,121 --> 00:42:51,840
son.
He's reliable and he's associated with

757
00:42:51,841 --> 00:42:54,720
consciousness and then he sort of ruling
over this city.

758
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,010
And so for me that was a good symbol of
culture and put it in part culture is

759
00:42:59,011 --> 00:43:02,250
what's outside of you,
but in part culture is also the

760
00:43:02,251 --> 00:43:05,820
frameworks that you've learned to use by
being with other people,

761
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:09,840
the frameworks that you've learned to
use to narrow and specify the world.

762
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:15,220
And in my motive thinking that framing
is associated with security on the one

763
00:43:16,711 --> 00:43:19,340
hand because it tells you what you can
do and you know,

764
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,100
makes things safe for you and tyranny on
the other hand because it can get out of

765
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,440
control and you can start to get too
rigid.

766
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:29,220
Whatever.
Regardless of the pros and cons of

767
00:43:29,221 --> 00:43:30,054
framing.

768
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,540
If you see something one way,
then you can't see it another,

769
00:43:34,541 --> 00:43:37,900
it's harder to see it another.
So that's the con side of framing the

770
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:41,170
pro side of framing is while it then you
get to do something.

771
00:43:41,171 --> 00:43:44,260
If it's unframed you're in chaos,
it's existential anxiety,

772
00:43:44,261 --> 00:43:46,780
you're not going to move ahead at all.
So you have to frame things,

773
00:43:46,781 --> 00:43:50,230
you have to simplify them.
And really in some sense you even have

774
00:43:50,231 --> 00:43:54,040
to oversimplify them.
It depends on what you mean by that.

775
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:57,600
But what you're really trying to do is
to never make your perceptual task any

776
00:43:57,601 --> 00:44:01,210
more complex and it has to be in order
to get done what you need to get done.

777
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,870
So how do you frame things?
Well,

778
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,260
the first thing we should point out is
that a lot of framing doesn't even

779
00:44:08,261 --> 00:44:11,200
happen psychologically,
right?

780
00:44:11,201 --> 00:44:15,820
So here you are sitting in this
classroom and you're not overwhelmed by

781
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:16,630
chaos.

782
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:17,463
Well,
why?

783
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:19,271
Well,
first of all,

784
00:44:19,271 --> 00:44:22,690
you're in a city that's helpful.
There's electricity here and there's

785
00:44:22,691 --> 00:44:25,330
natural gas and there's people to fix
all the plumbing.

786
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:28,780
And so the fact that you're in a city
makes life much simpler.

787
00:44:28,781 --> 00:44:31,110
Right off the bat.
There's no nothing trying to eat you.

788
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:34,740
You don't have to contend with the fact
that it's like minus 20 for three months

789
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:36,960
and you know,
so that's a whole bunch of complexity

790
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:41,961
that the were the civilized world has
just taken care of for you and then now

791
00:44:43,501 --> 00:44:46,650
you're in the university in the city and
that eliminates a whole bunch of other

792
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:47,484
hassles.
You know,

793
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,730
there's some things you have to do,
but there's a bunch of things you don't

794
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:53,490
have to do and then you're inside this
building and wow,

795
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:55,350
look at that.
There's electric light here and you

796
00:44:55,351 --> 00:44:55,690
know,
and,

797
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:59,310
and the chairs work and there's not
going to be an earthquake and probably

798
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:00,900
the whole building isn't going to fall
down.

799
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,570
So you know,
by the time you're sitting in your chair

800
00:45:03,571 --> 00:45:08,040
here also with your clothing on,
you screened a lot of complexity out

801
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:10,230
already.
And so you can sit there fairly calmly.

802
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,600
And so that's all external.
Now,

803
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,120
part of the reason,
and this is where thinking about,

804
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:18,600
because this isn't only psychological,
you'll guys will hear a fair bit about

805
00:45:18,601 --> 00:45:21,960
terror management theories as you
progress through your education.

806
00:45:21,961 --> 00:45:26,961
And so Karen Management theories are
theories that attempt to account for why

807
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:31,230
people are say patriotic in their
beliefs,

808
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:35,430
why they adopt belief systems,
and the idea is that a belief system

809
00:45:35,431 --> 00:45:39,480
protects you from death anxiety.
And so Freud's Sorta said that about

810
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,700
religious systems.
That was his critique of religion.

811
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:46,020
People are afraid of death and so they
have this infant title desire to have

812
00:45:46,021 --> 00:45:48,390
that fear go away.
So they turned to religion and religion

813
00:45:48,391 --> 00:45:48,841
says,
well,

814
00:45:48,841 --> 00:45:51,180
death isn't permanent and that's why
people are religious.

815
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:53,970
And the extension of that is,
well,

816
00:45:53,971 --> 00:45:56,280
that's also why they have belief systems
in general.

817
00:45:56,310 --> 00:46:00,090
They're trying to protect themselves
against this deep shaking anxiety.

818
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:02,550
And to some degree I suspect that's
true,

819
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,440
but you should also remember that when
you're protecting your culture,

820
00:46:07,441 --> 00:46:10,470
say if you identify with it,
you're patriotic or whatever it is,

821
00:46:10,471 --> 00:46:12,390
or you think that your culture is worth
defending.

822
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:15,090
You're not just defending something
psychological.

823
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:18,300
It's like the culture,
the function,

824
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:21,300
the functioning culture keeps the lights
on,

825
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,700
you know,
so it doesn't just protect you from

826
00:46:23,701 --> 00:46:27,000
death anxiety,
it also protects you from death.

827
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,210
And that's even more important.
Most of the time than being protected

828
00:46:30,211 --> 00:46:31,110
from death,
anxiety.

829
00:46:31,111 --> 00:46:33,180
Now there's a psychological component to
it too,

830
00:46:33,181 --> 00:46:37,800
but you don't ever want to underestimate
just the practical utility of being

831
00:46:37,801 --> 00:46:39,170
nested inside.
You know,

832
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:42,150
what Piaget would consider a relatively
functional game.

833
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:44,730
It's like your world is a lot simpler,
you know,

834
00:46:44,731 --> 00:46:47,580
you have to work to maintain it and
everything and that's kind of a drag.

835
00:46:47,581 --> 00:46:49,560
Maybe that's the tyrannical element of
it,

836
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:51,420
but you know,
the payoff's pretty big.

837
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:53,940
Okay.
So if you look at medieval cities,

838
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:56,970
this is a well preserved medieval city
in France.

839
00:46:56,971 --> 00:47:00,330
There's a lot of medieval cities that
still exist in Europe and you see this

840
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:05,310
is a typical sort of human habitation.
It's like inside there's order and

841
00:47:05,311 --> 00:47:09,090
outside there's chaos and barbarians and
then there's a couple of walls to keep

842
00:47:09,091 --> 00:47:12,030
the chaos and the barbarians out.
And then inside,

843
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,780
you know there's a dominance hierarchy
and everybody can live their relatively

844
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:19,350
productive and relatively peaceful lives
inside of that.

845
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:23,100
So all framing,
getting rid of complexity,

846
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:27,270
unnecessary complexity.
Same thing with houses.

847
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,310
They do the same thing for you.
And then social

848
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,380
institutions do the same thing too.
It's like,

849
00:47:32,381 --> 00:47:33,900
okay,
this is a,

850
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,660
is it Kennedy there and an Obama?
I think so.

851
00:47:37,661 --> 00:47:42,220
This is part of the transition in power
from George Bush to Obama and you know,

852
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:45,730
that's a pretty scary thing to have.
You're the leader of your dominance

853
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:48,790
hierarchy replaced by another leader and
you know,

854
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:53,410
among chimpanzees for example,
that's often the occasion for a fair bit

855
00:47:53,411 --> 00:47:57,880
of mayhem and it's also the case often
for people that that's,

856
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:00,220
you know,
that that occurs and you know,

857
00:48:00,221 --> 00:48:02,950
we still have that in the form of
political corruption and so on.

858
00:48:02,951 --> 00:48:04,930
But all things considered,
you know,

859
00:48:04,931 --> 00:48:09,931
the power of transition from Obama or
from Bush to Obama was far more peaceful

860
00:48:10,391 --> 00:48:13,150
than such.
Power transitions generally are if you

861
00:48:13,151 --> 00:48:17,590
look across the history of mankind,
and so that means you're also protected

862
00:48:17,591 --> 00:48:21,010
by your social institutions.
They screen out a lot of potential

863
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:24,430
complexity as well,
as long as they're functional.

864
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,770
And,
and also I think as long as they follow

865
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:30,870
some of the pig and rules.
And so one of the Phd and rules for a,

866
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,370
for a playable game is there's some
reciprocity.

867
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:37,060
You know,
you regard the system roughly speaking

868
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:42,210
as either fair or fairer than any other
system you can think up.

869
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,430
You know what it boils down to,
the same thing because if it's not fair,

870
00:48:45,431 --> 00:48:47,230
but you can't come up with a better
fantasy.

871
00:48:47,231 --> 00:48:49,570
Well,
it's as good as it can be.

872
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,120
So,
so the,

873
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:56,200
the sociological or sociopolitical
structures that keep complexity away

874
00:48:56,201 --> 00:49:00,160
from us can only operate under a certain
limited number of constraints.

875
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,910
But still they perform their function,
you know,

876
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:04,510
and very admirably.
It's,

877
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:07,450
it's amazing.
I think because I see people in my

878
00:49:07,451 --> 00:49:09,100
clinical practice all the time,
you know,

879
00:49:09,101 --> 00:49:12,880
and most people that I see,
and I think this is true of most people

880
00:49:12,881 --> 00:49:17,080
in the world have at least one serious
problem,

881
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,420
you know,
and it might be they have an illness

882
00:49:19,421 --> 00:49:20,740
that's just god awful.

883
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:25,090
Or if or if they don't have any illness,
one of their immediate family has an

884
00:49:25,091 --> 00:49:26,680
illness that's god awful.
Or they're,

885
00:49:26,681 --> 00:49:27,940
you know,
they're really old and they're,

886
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,690
and they need to be taken care of or
they're suffering from some insane

887
00:49:31,691 --> 00:49:35,110
economic problem or they've just been
unemployed or whatever.

888
00:49:35,111 --> 00:49:35,581
You know,
there's,

889
00:49:35,581 --> 00:49:38,890
there's something in their immediate
circle that's really,

890
00:49:38,891 --> 00:49:42,880
really difficult to grapple with and yet
people still go out and maintain their

891
00:49:42,881 --> 00:49:47,440
place in the world and the whole thing
roughly works and to me that's just a

892
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,400
continual source of amazement that
people can pull that off,

893
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:53,800
you know,
so anyway,

894
00:49:53,801 --> 00:49:58,090
so a lot of the screening that you do to
get rid of that complexity is external

895
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:00,550
and part of that is a consequence of
good,

896
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,420
well functioning,
sociological organization.

897
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:10,120
Then the next thing that sort of screens
things out for you as your body right

898
00:50:10,121 --> 00:50:10,954
now,
look,

899
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:14,560
you kind of naturally see things at a
particular level of resolution,

900
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:15,430
right?

901
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:18,070
There's no obvious reason why that
should be.

902
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,540
So,
you know,

903
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22,510
you see the front of people,
you can't see the back of them.

904
00:50:22,511 --> 00:50:25,900
You see their external covering their
skin and their clothes.

905
00:50:25,901 --> 00:50:28,430
You can't see inside them.
When you look closely at them,

906
00:50:28,431 --> 00:50:31,360
you can't see their cellular structure
or their molecular structure,

907
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:35,060
their atomic structure.
You can't really see the social

908
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:38,600
situations that they're embedded in.
So if I look at you,

909
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:40,270
I can't see your family.
I,

910
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:41,840
you know,
I presume you have one.

911
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,130
I can't really see the political
situation that surrounds you either.

912
00:50:46,131 --> 00:50:49,850
I have to know that abstractly and then
the ecological level is almost

913
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:54,851
completely imperceptible to me.
And so part of the way that complexity

914
00:50:54,921 --> 00:50:58,610
is screened out is that your body just
doesn't allow you to pick a lot of it

915
00:50:58,611 --> 00:51:00,500
up.
You're just blind to it.

916
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:05,740
So you see at one level of resolution
and that's the human level.

917
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:08,510
You see things of approximately our
size,

918
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,690
you see things that are approximately
the size that we can grip.

919
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:15,380
Those are sort of the things that you're
likely to come to think of as objects.

920
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:18,260
Like clearly a mountain isn't exactly an
object,

921
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:23,030
you know,
so usability is part of what defines

922
00:51:23,031 --> 00:51:26,030
perceptibility and so that also screens
things out

923
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:32,800
and so then you're left with while what
it is that you have to deal with once

924
00:51:34,281 --> 00:51:36,200
everything's been screened out.
And then you might ask,

925
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:39,170
well there's still a lot of complexity
left there.

926
00:51:39,171 --> 00:51:41,240
Like they say,
there's plenty of complexity within the

927
00:51:41,241 --> 00:51:45,770
average family and there's plenty of
complexity in the mating domain,

928
00:51:45,771 --> 00:51:47,990
you know,
to find a partner and to establish a

929
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:51,350
reasonable longterm relationship and to
have children and to raise them.

930
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:56,530
There's plenty of complexity left.
And then the question is how did

931
00:51:57,170 --> 00:52:00,200
biology,
how did biology come to solve those

932
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:01,034
problems?

933
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,410
Given that there are almost infinite
complexity,

934
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:06,710
how can you do it?
And the answer to that is fundamentally

935
00:52:06,711 --> 00:52:09,500
a Darwinian answer.
You start simple.

936
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:12,350
So that's back in the days of the one
celled organisms.

937
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,780
We have no idea how those things got
their start,

938
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:17,870
right?
I mean the actual beginning of life is a

939
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:20,150
serious mystery and Ocala,
you.

940
00:52:20,151 --> 00:52:23,120
It's such a serious mystery.
This is completely unbelievable,

941
00:52:23,121 --> 00:52:25,520
but one of the people who discovered
DNA,

942
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:27,410
I think it was Francis Crick,
in fact,

943
00:52:27,411 --> 00:52:31,160
I'm virtually certain it was.
He actually believed that DNA came from

944
00:52:31,161 --> 00:52:33,980
an alien civilization.
He wrote a whole book about that.

945
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:37,760
It's called Panspermia,
and so he believes that believed

946
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,710
posited,
that it's possible for DNA to drift

947
00:52:42,711 --> 00:52:47,711
through space for millions of years and
to land on planets and to start living

948
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:52,910
and God only knows how old dna is
because he just couldn't figure out at

949
00:52:52,911 --> 00:52:54,620
all how it could have possibly evolved.

950
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:59,900
So scientists are a lot weirder than you
think when you start to read about what

951
00:52:59,901 --> 00:53:03,710
the scientists who discovered things
really thought they're completely out of

952
00:53:03,711 --> 00:53:06,710
their mind,
but whatever.

953
00:53:06,711 --> 00:53:11,030
We'll assume that DNA got there somehow
and then evolution took over after that.

954
00:53:11,031 --> 00:53:13,310
And so what does evolution do?
It basically says,

955
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,760
well,
here is a terribly complex problem that

956
00:53:16,761 --> 00:53:21,500
we've sort of partially solved and
partially solved means we've lived long

957
00:53:21,501 --> 00:53:25,100
enough to produce another copy of
ourself that constitutes the solution.

958
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:30,140
That's it.
So we've lived long enough so that we

959
00:53:30,391 --> 00:53:33,240
could conceivably duplicate ourselves.
How should we do that?

960
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,070
Well,
a variety of different ways.

961
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:37,250
That's the answer.
We should produce variants,

962
00:53:37,251 --> 00:53:41,190
so that might be multiple offspring or
it might be.

963
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,900
It might also be facilitated by random
mutation.

964
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:48,060
Hypothetically,
that mutations are random,

965
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:53,360
although there's increasing evidence by
the way that organisms are much more

966
00:53:53,971 --> 00:53:58,380
complex at the genetic level than anyone
ever assumed and bacteria,

967
00:53:58,381 --> 00:54:00,750
for example,
swap DNA back and forth with other

968
00:54:00,751 --> 00:54:05,520
bacteria all the time and there are
experiences that you can have that will

969
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:09,210
change your genetic structure
sufficiently so that you will transmit

970
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:10,140
that to your children.

971
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:14,850
So you know the idea that everything's
purely Darwinian and it's only mutation

972
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:19,680
that drives randomness.
That's clearly likely,

973
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:23,550
but not not complete.
These other mechanisms are clearly

974
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:24,580
there,
but the.

975
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:26,710
The.
The issue is is that what you do is you.

976
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:30,210
You start with something that kind of
works and then you produce micro

977
00:54:30,211 --> 00:54:34,530
variants of it and then that world
around you changes a little bit and

978
00:54:34,531 --> 00:54:38,460
hopefully one of those micro variants
manages to do the same thing and then it

979
00:54:38,461 --> 00:54:42,720
produces a bunch of micro variance and
then they managed to do the same thing.

980
00:54:42,721 --> 00:54:46,530
And so what's happening is there's an
arms race between the environment which

981
00:54:46,531 --> 00:54:50,310
is always changing and the organisms
that are trying to keep up with it and

982
00:54:50,311 --> 00:54:52,980
that arms race just goes on forever.
And you know,

983
00:54:52,981 --> 00:54:56,670
different lifeforms proliferate as that,
as that occurs,

984
00:54:56,790 --> 00:55:01,380
it's sort of like life is always playing
catch up and you never get it right.

985
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:04,380
You cannot get it right.
The best you can do is get it right long

986
00:55:04,381 --> 00:55:09,381
enough to live long enough to reproduce.
That constitutes the sum total of your

987
00:55:11,371 --> 00:55:15,030
knowledge.
So and so what that means,

988
00:55:15,031 --> 00:55:16,980
at least in part,
is that you guys are all the

989
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:18,390
beneficiary,
let's say,

990
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:23,040
of a evolutionary process that's
basically been going on since the

991
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:25,620
beginning of life.
And that's about three point 5 billion

992
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:27,240
years ago.
And so your body,

993
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:32,340
your psychophysiology has been in an
arms race with the transforming

994
00:55:32,341 --> 00:55:36,630
environment for three and a half billion
years trying to keep up and poof,

995
00:55:36,631 --> 00:55:41,631
you're the stellar consequence of three
and a half billion years of like effort

996
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,700
and death.
So,

997
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:47,490
you know,
you might think the cosmos about that.

998
00:55:47,491 --> 00:55:50,730
You think about this,
every single one of your female

999
00:55:50,731 --> 00:55:55,560
ancestors successfully reproduced like
it's mind boggling.

1000
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:58,500
It's mind boggling.
You're so unlikely that you would be

1001
00:55:58,501 --> 00:55:59,334
here,
that,

1002
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:01,620
that it's,
that it's almost incalculable.

1003
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,100
So good for us.
Here we are.

1004
00:56:05,101 --> 00:56:06,720
You know,
how successful can you get?

1005
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:10,050
So my,
my point is that part of the way that

1006
00:56:10,051 --> 00:56:12,510
complexity is dealt with is,
is haphazard.

1007
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:16,020
It isn't ever really dealt with.
That's why you die.

1008
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:20,580
You can only manage it to a limited
degree.

1009
00:56:20,581 --> 00:56:24,760
And for us that's like three kids in 100
years if you're lucky.

1010
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,760
And that's what,
that's hard knowledge after three and a

1011
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:30,580
half billion years.
So the complexity problem is a rough

1012
00:56:30,581 --> 00:56:31,990
one.
Okay?

1013
00:56:31,991 --> 00:56:35,230
So that's your body.
Now let's look inside your body.

1014
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:38,550
Now you might think that,
you know,

1015
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:41,560
we have this sort of idea that's kind of
a leftover Cartesian,

1016
00:56:41,561 --> 00:56:45,250
that there's a you and there's a,
your body and the EU is in your brain.

1017
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:49,750
And so just out of curiosity,
how many of you have the subjective

1018
00:56:49,751 --> 00:56:54,751
sense that the EU is in your head?
How many of you would locate you?

1019
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:58,780
Like for me,
I can locate me somewhere.

1020
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,810
Seems to be about there.
I feel like that's where I am.

1021
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:05,500
Whatever.
And so how many of people think have

1022
00:57:05,501 --> 00:57:08,350
like the center of their sense of
subjectivity in their head?

1023
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,990
How many people are like that?
Okay.

1024
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,600
How many people are different than that?

1025
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:15,651
Okay.
So.

1026
00:57:15,651 --> 00:57:16,281
Oh good.
Okay.

1027
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:18,800
So where,
where do you feel the center of your

1028
00:57:18,801 --> 00:57:20,300
subjectivity?
Where would it be?

1029
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,320
Oh,
I was thinking more about how about how

1030
00:57:32,321 --> 00:57:33,640
it feels fair,
fair enough.

1031
00:57:33,641 --> 00:57:35,800
Fair enough.
You know that that's perfectly

1032
00:57:35,801 --> 00:57:37,450
reasonable.
I'm thinking of it more as a subjective

1033
00:57:37,451 --> 00:57:38,350
experience though.

1034
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:41,063
Okay.

1035
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:47,060
And so you're kind of located here.
How many people would would agree with

1036
00:57:47,061 --> 00:57:48,500
that?
Oh yeah.

1037
00:57:48,501 --> 00:57:50,810
So quite a few of you a.
So that's the same.

1038
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,510
Same for you.
More like here.

1039
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:55,100
Oh Hm.
Hm.

1040
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:57,200
Hm.
Any other places?

1041
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:00,190
Any other places you can talk about?
So

1042
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,411
yeah,
yeah,

1043
00:58:03,411 --> 00:58:08,411
yeah.
Any other places?

1044
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:17,000
Oh that's not good.
No,

1045
00:58:17,001 --> 00:58:17,950
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

1046
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,580
I'm kidding.
Okay.

1047
00:58:19,581 --> 00:58:20,420
Okay.
So okay,

1048
00:58:20,421 --> 00:58:22,220
so we've kind of gone hand in heart and
you know,

1049
00:58:22,221 --> 00:58:24,350
that's really kind of historically
standard.

1050
00:58:24,351 --> 00:58:27,470
The Greek seemed to look have located
themselves sort of in their heart.

1051
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,690
You know,
when there is some theory that as people

1052
00:58:29,691 --> 00:58:33,800
became more intellectualized that that
feeling sort of went up to their head

1053
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:36,290
and maybe before the heart there was the
stomach,

1054
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:37,280
you know,
and you know,

1055
00:58:37,281 --> 00:58:39,740
you might think that you're your stomach
if you were hungry all the time.

1056
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:40,641
Right?
I mean,

1057
00:58:40,641 --> 00:58:43,190
you're just not ever hungry.
So like why the hell would you think you

1058
00:58:43,191 --> 00:58:44,870
were in your stomach?
But you know,

1059
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:48,200
that's another way that culture sort of
keeps complexity at bay.

1060
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:52,100
You don't even,
that's almost like a motivational state

1061
00:58:52,101 --> 00:58:55,940
that modern people don't even have to
contend with because you're never really

1062
00:58:55,941 --> 00:58:56,691
hungry.
I mean,

1063
00:58:56,691 --> 00:58:59,690
how many of you have gone without food
for more than 24 hours?

1064
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,241
Oh,
that's pretty good.

1065
00:59:02,241 --> 00:59:06,020
How many of you in voluntarily went
without food for more than 24 hours?

1066
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:07,341
Oh yeah.
Well that's,

1067
00:59:07,341 --> 00:59:08,590
that's rough.
Okay.

1068
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:11,980
How about a week?
Nobody.

1069
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:13,060
How about three days?

1070
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:16,361
Okay.
Well,

1071
00:59:16,361 --> 00:59:18,370
so you know,
there's a couple of people who've gone

1072
00:59:18,371 --> 00:59:20,530
for reasonable periods of time without
eating,

1073
00:59:20,531 --> 00:59:24,680
but fundamentally you can tell we we of
got that problem under control so you

1074
00:59:24,681 --> 00:59:28,010
don't have to worry too much about your,
about you being your stomach,

1075
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:30,230
but I'll tell you if you were starving
at some point,

1076
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,410
that's probably where you'd locate
yourself.

1077
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,540
Okay,
so now you're inside the body and so

1078
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:37,700
let's take a look at how the body works
inside.

1079
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:40,460
So you kind of feel that you're in your
brain,

1080
00:59:40,461 --> 00:59:42,230
most of you anyways,
but,

1081
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,270
and you know,
you kind of think your brain is in your

1082
00:59:44,271 --> 00:59:46,250
head,
but really that's not right.

1083
00:59:46,251 --> 00:59:51,110
I don't really understand ever why we
kind of decided that our brains,

1084
00:59:51,111 --> 00:59:52,190
we're in our head because.
Well,

1085
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,000
look at it,
there's,

1086
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,880
there's the nervous system.
It's like it's not in your hand.

1087
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,830
It's distributed through your whole
body.

1088
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:01,520
There's a lot of it up in your head,
but there's the whole spinal cord.

1089
01:00:01,521 --> 01:00:04,340
That's an important thing.
And then it has all these branching

1090
01:00:04,341 --> 01:00:07,250
nerves that allow you to move your hands
and to feel things.

1091
01:00:07,251 --> 01:00:09,920
And it's like your nervous system is
distributed all the way through your

1092
01:00:09,921 --> 01:00:13,010
body,
so it's not reasonable to think about

1093
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:17,120
the way that you operate as you see
things with your brain.

1094
01:00:17,121 --> 01:00:20,120
And then you do things now,
if that's sort of true,

1095
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:22,370
but there's important ways that it's not
true at all.

1096
01:00:22,371 --> 01:00:25,190
And it's important to know the ways that
it's not true.

1097
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:28,220
It helps you understand phenomena that
you couldn't otherwise understand.

1098
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,690
So I can give you an example.
There are people who experience

1099
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:34,370
blindness,
so,

1100
01:00:34,371 --> 01:00:37,100
but it doesn't because their eyes get
damaged just because they have brain

1101
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:37,934
damage.
And so it,

1102
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,830
it damages the visual cortex.

1103
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:42,890
And so that's the higher order,
higher order part of the brain that's

1104
01:00:42,891 --> 01:00:45,500
responsible for conscious vision.
Okay.

1105
01:00:45,501 --> 01:00:46,970
So maybe they get,
I don't know,

1106
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:49,070
they get a tumor,
they get hit in the head or they get

1107
01:00:49,071 --> 01:00:51,260
shot or something and then poof,
they're blind.

1108
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,750
And so then,
um,

1109
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,330
they tell you they can't see anything
and then you say to them,

1110
01:00:56,331 --> 01:00:57,590
okay,
well that's fine.

1111
01:00:57,591 --> 01:00:59,750
You can't see anything,
but let's play a game.

1112
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,150
Okay,
I'm going to hold up my left hand or my

1113
01:01:02,151 --> 01:01:06,080
right hand and you're going to guess
about which I'm holding up.

1114
01:01:06,081 --> 01:01:09,050
And so you do this and they go right and
you do this.

1115
01:01:09,051 --> 01:01:11,000
And they go left,
left,

1116
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:12,920
left,
right,

1117
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:15,140
right.
And they're right.

1118
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:17,210
And you tell them you're right.
And they say,

1119
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:18,890
well I can't because I don't see
anything.

1120
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,860
So that's one that's blind sight.
Okay.

1121
01:01:21,861 --> 01:01:23,300
So here's another kind of blind sight.

1122
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:28,040
So you take the same person and you set
them in front of the screen and you say,

1123
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:29,570
well look at the screen and they tell
you,

1124
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:34,280
I told you already I can't see anything.
And then you flash faces at them and

1125
01:01:34,281 --> 01:01:35,180
you,
you,

1126
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:38,600
you check for changes in the
conductivity of their skin.

1127
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:41,870
Because when people react emotionally,
they sweat a little more,

1128
01:01:41,871 --> 01:01:45,500
a little less than that changes how
electricity passes through their skin.

1129
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:49,020
And so you show them a smiling face and
there's not much of a change and you

1130
01:01:49,021 --> 01:01:51,890
know,
you show them a neutral face and there's

1131
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,650
not much of a change.
And then you show them like a really

1132
01:01:54,651 --> 01:01:59,270
aggressive or really afraid face and
poof spikes and you do that in a number

1133
01:01:59,271 --> 01:02:02,060
of times and you show them well.
And as soon as I show you a face of

1134
01:02:02,061 --> 01:02:04,970
someone who's afraid or face,
if someone who's angry,

1135
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,790
you react to it psychophysiological you
think,

1136
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:10,220
well,
how the hell can that happen if they

1137
01:02:10,221 --> 01:02:11,054
can't see?

1138
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:16,650
And the answer that is you don't just
see with your vision you see with your

1139
01:02:17,121 --> 01:02:19,620
body.
And so one of the things that you'll

1140
01:02:19,621 --> 01:02:20,431
find,
for example,

1141
01:02:20,431 --> 01:02:24,120
if you go through Swanson's paper,
I'll read you a little bit about this

1142
01:02:24,121 --> 01:02:27,060
later,
is that most of your senses map onto

1143
01:02:27,061 --> 01:02:31,530
multiple levels of your nervous system.
So some of them not right onto your

1144
01:02:31,531 --> 01:02:34,560
spine.
And that's good because now and then

1145
01:02:34,561 --> 01:02:37,410
your eyes should tell your spine to do
something before you think,

1146
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:40,800
because thinkings too slow.
And so you know,

1147
01:02:40,801 --> 01:02:43,920
you gotta understand like way back when
we were frogs,

1148
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,260
roughly speaking,
we had eyes.

1149
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:50,040
We didn't have much of a brain.
So like what the hell were the eyes

1150
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:53,100
doing?
That's not like the frog exactly sees.

1151
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:54,750
And you might think,
well,

1152
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:57,990
how could eyes inform you about the
world if you don't?

1153
01:02:57,991 --> 01:03:00,530
Exactly see?
And then you got to kind of think about

1154
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:01,770
it didn't appear as jetty and sense.

1155
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:04,310
It's like,
here,

1156
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:07,230
here's an example.
You might take an animal like a sponge,

1157
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:12,290
pretty simple animal,
and it can open and close doors on the

1158
01:03:12,391 --> 01:03:17,391
outside of its surface according to
different changes in the ocean that

1159
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:21,360
surrounds it.
And so it's perception.

1160
01:03:21,361 --> 01:03:24,570
It's sort of like the ocean has three
states,

1161
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,220
whatever those might be.
Maybe it has 10,

1162
01:03:26,221 --> 01:03:28,110
I don't know.
But for the sake of simplicity,

1163
01:03:28,111 --> 01:03:31,290
we'll say three.
The ocean manifests itself in three

1164
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:35,940
patterns states in pattern state one,
I do this in pattern state too.

1165
01:03:35,941 --> 01:03:40,110
I do this in pattern state three,
I do this and so it's direct pattern

1166
01:03:40,111 --> 01:03:44,040
onto action mapping.
And so animals can use the rice just to

1167
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:47,160
react with.
Don't have to see that thing,

1168
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:49,200
you know,
because you think you see and then you

1169
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:50,670
act.
But why do that?

1170
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:54,360
You can just react and you knew this
already because in a simple way,

1171
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,950
if you put your hand on a hot stove,
you'll go like this and then you'll feel

1172
01:03:58,951 --> 01:04:02,250
the pain,
and what that means is that your body

1173
01:04:02,251 --> 01:04:06,210
has conserved the relationship between
your sensory neurons and your motor

1174
01:04:06,211 --> 01:04:09,000
neurons out of spinal level so that you
will.

1175
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:14,030
Your perception of the heat is this.
It's not the heat.

1176
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:19,350
It's just mapping a bodily pattern onto
a sensory pattern,

1177
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:25,050
and so a lot of really primitive sensory
input is exactly that.

1178
01:04:25,051 --> 01:04:29,610
It's just the sensor detects a pattern
and with no intermediary of

1179
01:04:29,611 --> 01:04:32,550
interpretation,
that pattern is translated into a

1180
01:04:32,551 --> 01:04:37,530
behavioral output.
So there's actually generally the first,

1181
01:04:37,531 --> 01:04:39,600
the simplest cells or sensory motor
cells.

1182
01:04:39,601 --> 01:04:42,600
So they do both.
They map the pattern and the react and

1183
01:04:42,601 --> 01:04:47,220
then the sensory and the motor cells
differentiate and then neuro tissue

1184
01:04:47,221 --> 01:04:50,730
grows inside them.
And so then what happens is that instead

1185
01:04:50,731 --> 01:04:54,510
of an outside pattern being mapped
immediately onto a behavioral pattern,

1186
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:57,540
the neuro intermediary says,
okay,

1187
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,780
this pattern could mean that any of
these three things,

1188
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:04,770
and then that neural layer grows and
grows and grows.

1189
01:05:04,771 --> 01:05:07,410
Until being creatures like us,
it's like a whopping layer,

1190
01:05:07,411 --> 01:05:09,840
and so we see a pattern and we go,
that could be this,

1191
01:05:09,841 --> 01:05:10,351
this,
this,

1192
01:05:10,351 --> 01:05:10,891
this,
this,

1193
01:05:10,891 --> 01:05:11,431
this,
this,

1194
01:05:11,431 --> 01:05:13,590
this,
and then all of those things could be

1195
01:05:13,591 --> 01:05:15,720
mapped onto this or this or this or this
or this.

1196
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,860
So you know,
it makes us more slower,

1197
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:20,740
but more flexible and slow can be a
problem.

1198
01:05:20,741 --> 01:05:23,290
So like when you're walking down a
pathway and the snake appears,

1199
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,050
you don't want to be thinking snake,
rubber,

1200
01:05:26,051 --> 01:05:27,040
hose,
stick,

1201
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,360
whatever,
you know,

1202
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:30,250
because then you're dead because the
snake bites you.

1203
01:05:30,251 --> 01:05:33,280
What you want to do is catch the snake
out of the corner of your eye and jump

1204
01:05:33,281 --> 01:05:36,610
up into the air before you even know
that you saw a snake.

1205
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:40,690
And you can do that because your eyes
can map right onto your spine and they

1206
01:05:40,691 --> 01:05:43,840
don't just map right onto your spine.
They map onto your nervous system and

1207
01:05:43,841 --> 01:05:45,580
all sorts of levels.
So for example,

1208
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:50,230
with the blind sight person who's
looking at the face,

1209
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:53,680
so it's an angry face,
the eyes are still mapping information

1210
01:05:53,681 --> 01:05:57,580
onto the Amygdala and the amygdala
changes the psychophysiology.

1211
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,310
You know,
it says prepare for threat and so the

1212
01:06:00,311 --> 01:06:04,120
person might feel uneasy but that's,
it's weird,

1213
01:06:04,121 --> 01:06:08,320
but that's a form of site to feel uneasy
can be a form of site.

1214
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:14,310
So
and that's to say even more clearly that

1215
01:06:15,191 --> 01:06:17,800
your brain just isn't in your head.
It's like it's all the way up.

1216
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:21,060
It's all the way from,
and this is a nice pot of viewpoint

1217
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:23,710
because you know,
in some sense what Piaget says about

1218
01:06:23,711 --> 01:06:27,130
children is they sort of organize
themselves from the spinal level

1219
01:06:27,131 --> 01:06:28,080
upwards.
You know,

1220
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,460
they learn these little sub routines.
First of all,

1221
01:06:30,461 --> 01:06:34,390
they have a few sub routine so it was
like built right into the spine and then

1222
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:37,660
they start playing with those and
chaining them together in flexible ways

1223
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:39,460
and they keep doing that,
you know,

1224
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:43,330
in more and more complex ways until
they're capable of the abstract

1225
01:06:43,331 --> 01:06:47,200
representation of thought.
And you can see how this will work as we

1226
01:06:47,201 --> 01:06:48,970
go through the,
the nervous system.

1227
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:54,180
So your brains in your body,
in fact there's some evidence and

1228
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,200
there's more than one kind of nervous
system too,

1229
01:06:56,201 --> 01:06:56,410
right?

1230
01:06:56,410 --> 01:07:00,790
There's the central nervous system that
allows you to move voluntarily and that

1231
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,490
you know,
provides you with sensory feedback,

1232
01:07:03,491 --> 01:07:06,370
some of which you're conscious of it.
There's also the autonomic nervous

1233
01:07:06,371 --> 01:07:09,970
system that runs your all the complex
machinery that you're too stupid to

1234
01:07:09,971 --> 01:07:14,200
attend to because your consciousness
gets little jobs.

1235
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:16,690
It doesn't get to run your liver.
For example.

1236
01:07:16,691 --> 01:07:19,510
You imagine what your life would be like
if you were in charge of your liver.

1237
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:22,900
It's like you'd have been dead years ago
because what do you know about livers?

1238
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:27,250
So you have a whole system like the
autonomic nervous system which has more

1239
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:31,180
neurons than the central nervous system
that just runs all that stuff for you,

1240
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:34,540
which is a good thing you do and then
you don't have to pay attention to it.

1241
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:36,940
So.
So anyways,

1242
01:07:36,941 --> 01:07:41,941
there's a lot of distribution of neural
tissue throughout your body and there's

1243
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:47,110
even some evidence that you have a like
a second brain of sorts in your solar

1244
01:07:47,111 --> 01:07:50,230
plexus where you know,
that's perhaps part of the reason why

1245
01:07:50,231 --> 01:07:53,200
you really don't like to get hit there.
But there's a tremendous number of

1246
01:07:53,201 --> 01:07:55,000
serotonergic neurons,
for example,

1247
01:07:55,001 --> 01:07:56,650
in your,
in your midsection,

1248
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:59,890
and there's increasing evidence that
those are associated with things like

1249
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:04,780
emotion and mood.
And so the idea that the brain is here,

1250
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,240
it's like,
no,

1251
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:08,770
not,
not really.

1252
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,210
It's,
it's a continuum.

1253
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:14,950
You know your body is a
psychophysiological entity and to

1254
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,920
separate it into body and mind is like
it's not right.

1255
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,290
The other thing that seems to be
increasingly clear among say the

1256
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:26,630
robotics guys,
you can't even be smart unless you have

1257
01:08:26,631 --> 01:08:30,140
a body,
and so that's why the advanced advanced

1258
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:34,310
intelligence guys are building robots
from the bottom up.

1259
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:36,590
They're doing it just like piaget would
have suggested.

1260
01:08:36,591 --> 01:08:37,131
It's like,
well,

1261
01:08:37,131 --> 01:08:40,460
build some things that can move and then
chain those things that can move

1262
01:08:40,461 --> 01:08:43,670
together so that they can move in more
complex ways and then chain them

1263
01:08:43,671 --> 01:08:45,740
together so they can work in more
complex ways.

1264
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:48,470
And once you've got this thing that can
do things,

1265
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,400
then stick a brain on it and that'll.
Then it'll have things it can do with

1266
01:08:52,401 --> 01:08:54,350
its brain.
And if you don't do it that way,

1267
01:08:54,351 --> 01:08:57,470
you get something that can't function
intelligently,

1268
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:59,990
it's close to that.
So,

1269
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:06,080
so there is the brain and the major one
way of dividing it into its major

1270
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:08,900
subcomponents is represented.

1271
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,340
There's a variety of ways you can do
this.

1272
01:09:10,341 --> 01:09:12,620
You can divide it into hemispheres
because it's sort of split down the

1273
01:09:12,621 --> 01:09:15,080
middle.
The right hemisphere seems to be kind of

1274
01:09:15,081 --> 01:09:19,010
specialized for the processing of
unknown information.

1275
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:23,930
And the left seems to be more
comfortable working where you know

1276
01:09:23,931 --> 01:09:28,190
what's going to happen and that the left
is most generally the linguistic part of

1277
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,390
the brain.
Although not always,

1278
01:09:29,391 --> 01:09:30,440
it's,
it's a rough,

1279
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:32,150
you know,
what would you call it?

1280
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:36,380
It's a rough truth.
There's lots of exceptions.

1281
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:40,760
The linguistic systems tends to
specialize in the left and the left

1282
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:43,760
sorta insists that it knows what's going
on.

1283
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:47,480
And the right is always looking out for
things that don't fit and sort of

1284
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:51,800
convincing the left slowly and sort of
under the table to change its

1285
01:09:51,801 --> 01:09:52,970
viewpoints.
And that seemed.

1286
01:09:52,971 --> 01:09:55,250
A lot of that seems to happen when
you're asleep and you're dreaming.

1287
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,860
So the right,
maybe what's happening when you're

1288
01:09:57,861 --> 01:10:01,490
dreaming is that during the day your
cognitive processes are pretty tight and

1289
01:10:01,491 --> 01:10:05,990
defined and they better be right because
you don't want to be dreaming your

1290
01:10:05,991 --> 01:10:08,660
schizophrenia dreams in the daytime.
That's a bad idea.

1291
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:13,580
So you gotta stay kind of focused and
narrow in a way during the day.

1292
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:17,930
But the problem with that narrowed,
narrow focus is that you're not paying

1293
01:10:17,931 --> 01:10:20,870
attention to a lot of things.
And so it kind of looks like your right

1294
01:10:20,871 --> 01:10:24,260
hemisphere keeps track of the
potentially important things that you're

1295
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:28,410
not keeping track of and sort of.
And then at night you're,

1296
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:31,340
your category system sort of broadens
and loosens.

1297
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,380
You can tell that in dreams because
they're so weird.

1298
01:10:33,381 --> 01:10:37,250
And that's maybe when the right
hemisphere sort of tapping some new

1299
01:10:37,251 --> 01:10:41,510
information into the left and playing
with how it might be recategorized

1300
01:10:41,511 --> 01:10:44,540
without completely overwhelming the left
because

1301
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,710
you don't want to,
just because you learn something new,

1302
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:50,600
it doesn't mean you want to upset
yourself.

1303
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,351
Totally.
Right?

1304
01:10:51,351 --> 01:10:55,340
So it's a real.
It's a real complex dynamic between

1305
01:10:55,341 --> 01:10:58,490
stability and learning.
And it's conceivable that's why you have

1306
01:10:58,491 --> 01:11:00,980
two hemispheres.
So who knows,

1307
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:04,250
it's good in theory though,
and the guy who came up with it

1308
01:11:04,251 --> 01:11:06,110
fundamentally,
his name is Goldberg,

1309
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:09,980
Alconan Goldberg.
He was a student of Alexander

1310
01:11:09,981 --> 01:11:11,760
[inaudible] who was a great
neuropsychologist.

1311
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:13,380
So you know,
it's credible.

1312
01:11:13,381 --> 01:11:18,090
It's credible idea.
So here's some rough divisions.

1313
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:21,990
You've got your cerebellum that
cerebellum,

1314
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,900
we don't know what the hell that thing
does if you don't have one,

1315
01:11:24,901 --> 01:11:27,660
you get a little wobbly,
but there's more neurons in the

1316
01:11:27,661 --> 01:11:29,970
cerebellum than there are in the rest of
the brain.

1317
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:33,150
So like,
is it just making you not wobbly?

1318
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:37,950
It seems like a tremendous
devotion of resources to something

1319
01:11:37,951 --> 01:11:42,951
that's relatively simple.
So a hall when you're a new drinker,

1320
01:11:43,081 --> 01:11:45,480
alcohol's really hard on the Cerebellum,
which is why you're,

1321
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:48,600
you know,
totally useless in a motorway and you

1322
01:11:48,601 --> 01:11:50,120
fall down and all those things happened.

1323
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,560
But.
So that's the cerebellum and we don't

1324
01:11:52,561 --> 01:11:55,870
know what it does even though it's very
complex,

1325
01:11:55,871 --> 01:11:58,020
highly branched.
It kind of looks like a cauliflower and

1326
01:11:58,021 --> 01:12:01,320
it's just packed full of neurons.
And then there's the occipital lobe and

1327
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:04,080
that kind of use that to see with more
or less.

1328
01:12:04,081 --> 01:12:08,550
And then the prior lobe Kinda keeps,
it helps keep track of who,

1329
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:12,570
who you are from a bodily perspective
and sort of where your body's located in

1330
01:12:12,571 --> 01:12:15,690
space and sort of who you are as an
embodied person.

1331
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,480
So for example,
if you lose the right parietal lobe

1332
01:12:18,481 --> 01:12:21,600
because you have a stroke,
then you lose the left side of your body

1333
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:25,680
and even more weirdly you lose the left
side of everything.

1334
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,320
So all of a sudden you can't see the
left side of it.

1335
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:32,490
Anything and no one can figure out what
that's like because say I'm looking at

1336
01:12:32,491 --> 01:12:35,970
this room and I have this parietal
damage.

1337
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:39,030
If I'm looking at the room,
do I not see the left side of the room?

1338
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:42,000
And then if I look at you,
all of a sudden I don't see your left

1339
01:12:42,001 --> 01:12:43,620
side.
Like we can't figure that out.

1340
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:48,270
Like the left is gone.
But then the left is relative to where

1341
01:12:48,271 --> 01:12:51,480
you happen to be looking.
I think one of the ways of understanding

1342
01:12:51,481 --> 01:12:52,560
it is sort of like,
you know,

1343
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:57,561
how you clearly can't see anything
behind your head and it's not black

1344
01:12:57,870 --> 01:12:58,920
where you can't see,
right.

1345
01:12:58,921 --> 01:13:03,420
It's black if you close your eyes.
But there's a difference between what

1346
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:07,110
you can't see behind your head in the
black you see when you close your eyes

1347
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,850
because the block sort of seems like
nothing.

1348
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:11,300
But compared to what's behind your head,
it's,

1349
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:14,250
it's not nothing at all.
So I think what happens with people who

1350
01:13:14,251 --> 01:13:18,960
have neglect parietal damages that,
that like back park just goes like this.

1351
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:24,090
And so instead of you seeing this much
of the world and this being just not

1352
01:13:24,091 --> 01:13:25,980
there at all,
as far as vision is concerned,

1353
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,910
it goes like this.
So then you've only got like a quarter

1354
01:13:29,911 --> 01:13:32,670
of the world that you're.
And so people like that sometimes

1355
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:35,820
they'll throw their own legs out of bed,
say wake up and they think,

1356
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,340
oh my God.
Because they can kind of detect the left

1357
01:13:38,341 --> 01:13:40,980
but not very well.
And they're quite freaked out because

1358
01:13:40,981 --> 01:13:41,560
you know,
like,

1359
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,380
do you really want to wake up with a leg
in bed with,

1360
01:13:43,381 --> 01:13:44,980
you know,
so they grab it,

1361
01:13:45,010 --> 01:13:46,860
throw it out,
and that's not so good because they're

1362
01:13:46,861 --> 01:13:51,690
attached to it or so they'll eat,
they'll eat and they only eat half the

1363
01:13:51,691 --> 01:13:53,310
food on their plate.
But if you turn the plate,

1364
01:13:53,311 --> 01:13:55,290
then the lead half of the half that's
left.

1365
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:56,920
So anyways,
that's the pride.

1366
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:01,920
A little temporal lobe
that enables you to here roughly

1367
01:14:02,551 --> 01:14:05,250
speaking,
there's a lot of memory there too.

1368
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:07,680
And the frontal lobe,
well first of all,

1369
01:14:07,681 --> 01:14:12,681
the frontal lobe seems to allow you to
make voluntary movements sort of at the,

1370
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:17,320
at the highest level of abstraction.
And then the prefrontal Cortex,

1371
01:14:17,321 --> 01:14:19,630
which would be right at the front of the
yellow there.

1372
01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:24,760
It's sort of like the back part of the,
of the frontal lobe enables you to make

1373
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:28,120
voluntary movements,
but the prefrontal cortex enables you to

1374
01:14:28,121 --> 01:14:32,710
represent the potential motor movements
that you might make before you implement

1375
01:14:32,711 --> 01:14:35,080
them.
And so it evolved out of the motor

1376
01:14:35,081 --> 01:14:36,640
strip.
During the course of evolution,

1377
01:14:36,641 --> 01:14:38,350
it's sort of like,
well first you learn how to act

1378
01:14:38,351 --> 01:14:42,580
voluntarily and then as that grew and
it's particularly big in human beings,

1379
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:46,780
that part was able to divorce actions
from your body,

1380
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:52,690
represent them in an abstract space,
run the MS simulations,

1381
01:14:52,691 --> 01:14:56,110
calculate the outcome,
and then implement them or not and you

1382
01:14:56,111 --> 01:14:56,980
know it's a,
it's a,

1383
01:14:57,220 --> 01:15:02,220
it's a hit and miss business because
lots of you people undoubtedly simulate

1384
01:15:02,741 --> 01:15:06,130
catastrophic outcomes and then go do
whatever it is you were going to do

1385
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:06,610
anyways.

1386
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:08,650
Like you know,
that happens to people all the time say

1387
01:15:08,651 --> 01:15:12,640
when they're trying to stop drinking or
to stop using cocaine or not to binge

1388
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:14,740
eat or.
So you know,

1389
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:18,490
your prefrontal Cortex can whip up these
simulations,

1390
01:15:18,491 --> 01:15:21,490
but other parts of your body can
override them quite,

1391
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:24,700
quite badly.
So that's sort of roughly the brain at

1392
01:15:24,701 --> 01:15:26,100
least from,
you know,

1393
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:31,170
looking at it from the side and then
this is it split down the middle and you

1394
01:15:32,651 --> 01:15:37,270
can see that it's not precisely two
hemispheres all the way down

1395
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:41,620
in the middle.
It's one thing and then it grows.

1396
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:46,330
These two things like little hat and uh,
as far as I'm concerned,

1397
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:48,790
all the important parts of the brain
brainer,

1398
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,450
low down central,
old,

1399
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:54,820
you know,
because people like to think that,

1400
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,040
well,
if they don't evolved a long time ago,

1401
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:59,170
it's primitive.
It's like,

1402
01:15:59,171 --> 01:16:02,110
no.
If it evolved a long time ago,

1403
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:06,460
it's been around a long time.
It's really smart.

1404
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:10,720
That's why you don't run your liver.
The autonomic nervous system runs it

1405
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:13,870
because it's been around for an awful
long time and it knows exactly how to do

1406
01:16:13,871 --> 01:16:15,640
it.
And so it's really,

1407
01:16:15,641 --> 01:16:19,690
in some sense the new parts of the
brains or the brain in many ways are the

1408
01:16:19,691 --> 01:16:23,680
parts that are primitive.
So in the old parts are extremely

1409
01:16:23,681 --> 01:16:27,520
necessary and sophisticated.
And so the areas we're going to

1410
01:16:27,521 --> 01:16:29,880
concentrate on most particularly our
well,

1411
01:16:29,881 --> 01:16:34,030
the Cortex we've already talked about
the cortex is probably responsible.

1412
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:38,650
People like to think of it as
responsible for consciousness.

1413
01:16:38,651 --> 01:16:40,570
And there's something about that that's
right,

1414
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:45,600
but it's quite clear that human beings
can remain conscious even if they have a

1415
01:16:47,531 --> 01:16:50,140
substantial amount of damage to the
cerebral cortex.

1416
01:16:50,141 --> 01:16:54,610
So consciousness is a really weird thing
where we're not very good at figuring

1417
01:16:54,611 --> 01:16:58,090
out where it's localized at all
three book,

1418
01:16:58,091 --> 01:17:00,850
Cortex,
Thalamus,

1419
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:04,330
the Thalamus is the place where all your
sensory information comes together.

1420
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,430
So you know,
when you look at the world,

1421
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:10,100
it's kind of like a continuum of
experience despite the fact that you

1422
01:17:10,101 --> 01:17:14,210
have these five different sensory inputs
and the Thalamus seems to sort of unite

1423
01:17:14,211 --> 01:17:19,211
all that and then it sends the messages
that it amalgamates up to the cortex and

1424
01:17:19,971 --> 01:17:23,120
the cortex sends the back and the
Thalamus sends them back and there's

1425
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:28,300
this loop between the fellas and the
cortex and maybe that's part of what

1426
01:17:28,581 --> 01:17:29,820
consciousness is,
you know,

1427
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:34,100
rather than being localized in an area,
it could easily be a process and you

1428
01:17:34,101 --> 01:17:36,110
know,
the fact that consciousness sort of

1429
01:17:36,111 --> 01:17:39,260
turns on in the morning,
which is a very weird thing,

1430
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:42,500
seems to indicate to me that it's
probably something like that.

1431
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:45,380
It's a loop.
It's the looping interaction between

1432
01:17:45,381 --> 01:17:48,230
brain areas and you know,
if something's looping like that,

1433
01:17:48,231 --> 01:17:52,760
it gets really weird properties.
So that's a positive feedback system.

1434
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:55,800
You know,
and I don't know if you've ever turned a

1435
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:58,160
bit,
hooked a video camera to a TV and then

1436
01:17:58,161 --> 01:18:00,550
turn the video camera on the TV.
You know,

1437
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,310
it starts doing extremely weird things.
You can get all sorts of unbelievably

1438
01:18:04,311 --> 01:18:09,311
complex designs and weird phenomena
because the TV is recycling its own

1439
01:18:09,741 --> 01:18:11,930
signal,
so there's this circuit in there that's

1440
01:18:11,931 --> 01:18:16,931
looping and I suspect consciousness as
something like that of the hippocampus.

1441
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:23,170
The hippocampus is responsible for the
movement of short term information into

1442
01:18:23,301 --> 01:18:25,610
longterm storage.
It's a very important part of the brain.

1443
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:29,660
We'll talk about that more next time.
The amygdala is responsible for a lot of

1444
01:18:29,661 --> 01:18:34,661
emotional responses and the hypothalamus
is responsible for a lot of primordial

1445
01:18:35,931 --> 01:18:40,931
motivational states.
And so we'll stop and we'll start with

1446
01:18:42,791 --> 01:18:47,620
the hypothalamus on Tuesday.
See you soon.
